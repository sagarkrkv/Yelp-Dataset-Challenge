Was really looking forward to visiting this place based on Yelp reviews. Honestly, quite a let down. It wasn't bad, but didn't live-up to the hype for me.. . Order the Ruben only to be told as I was paying they're out of pastrami. Out of Pastrami at 4:00 p.m. on a Wednesday, really? So I ordered the Original. It was very average, not bad but nothing to write home about. Claimed there was horseradish on it but I couldn't taste it so I asked for a side of horseradish and I was handed a cup with something that resembled what's inside the packets at Arby's (although Arby's is better). Not what I was expecting.. . Again not bad, just average for me. Many better places in that area to eat.
Great place for a yummy sandwich. To me it was a step above some of the other sandwich shops in town. I would say that for the price and the taste of the sandwich you are getting your money's worth.
That infamous gold "brick" as they say. Came here for a midnight snack and got the full montagu. Its not just a regular sandwich, its beyond that. Out of this world to be exact. This place aint no hype, but the real deal. Better than subway, togos, quiznos, and all your "whole-in-the-wall" sandwiches. I never went to the one in downtown disney but don't go to that one. Go here, inside the planet hollywood location. Go order the full montagu and walk down the strip, watch the dancing fountain, while gambling, or better yet - bring it to a strip club and enjoy it there! Part of my top ten best sandwiches.
If you're in the mood for a sandwich and a bowl of soup after a kickass night, then this is a good, no I mean great idea! I've been here several times and they never do me wrong. Go with either the Ruben or the chipotle chicken sandwich, with a bowl of chickentortilla soup, mmmm. Time to bust through that hangover and start again. Only knock is the sandwiches are small as heck.
The restaurant was Ok, nothing really to write home about especially when you figure in the pricing of it. The fact that I think a grocery store soup and salad at a Whole Foods is better. Thats just the deal.
It's 24 hours and they make really great sandwiches, we stayed in Planet Hollywood so it's was nice to have decent food anytime.
This has been a favorite spot for years. The sandwiches are amazing, and it's in the Planet Hollywood, so one of the nicer but not stuck up areas of the Strip. Unless you go at a real-late hour, though, be prepared for an understandable wait, and even if you do go real late there's a risk. Full Montague, every day, all day.
Going to Vegas is pricy but eating here never hurts my pocket.   This is the best sandwich place on the strip and the price just adds the extra star.   Caribbean Jerk was good but I don't think I have had a bad sandwich here.   Must Try!
Sandwiches are ok but wilted warm lettuce is gross.  . . The employees are bored and can't be bothered to even fake a smile--both at the point of ordering and the cashier.  They also mixed up my order with other customers' orders twice.. . Get them a tip jar and they may be able to fake it for the length of their shifts.
Line moves relatively fast so don't trip.. Great value for the food your getting (In respect to most of the places on the strip). . - Chipotle Chicken Avocado (Grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce) is on point. You really can't go wrong with this.. . - Holiday Turkey (Turkey, corn bread stuffing, cranberry sauce & mayonnaise) was good, but seemed to be lacking something. If I order again I'd probably ask for some red onions on it.
The best sandwich in Vegas.. . I could end the review with that, but it wouldn't be fair to the place.  Located near the south entrance (strip side) of Planet Hollywood, this place is an absolute must for anyone looking for a quick bite 24/7.  Don't be afraid of the lines, they move faster than you would think.  And the food is worth the wait.  . . I've had a couple of the salads (Caesar & Thai), and sandwiches (tuna melt, Chipotle chicken, club to name a few).  . . Try it.  You'll be impressed.  I can't wait to try something new next time.
Yes it lives up to the hype.. Yes there will be a long line.. Yes you should come here sober or drunk.. . Can't decide on a sammie? -- Go splities with a friend on two sammies. Odds are you'll enjoy both.. . But if i had to -- Full Montagu, Italian and Original.
Quick in-and-out place. Expect it to be busy and it can be difficult to find a table. If you're looking for quick and easy in Vegas without going fast food, this is a good option.
This is not what I was expecting from the reviews. The sandwiches are SMALL...and that's saying a lot from me because I don't ever finish my meals. Yes, this is a quick eat, and yes it was a decent sandwich. However, you are in Vegas where there is GREAT food all around...don't settle for this.
Finally, I found a place in Vegas that is a decent substitute for a hoagie from the Northeast.. . A hoagie/sandwich is one of those things where the major components all add to the overall experience.  You can't just have one component carry the slack for the rest of the components.  A lot of times I'll find a place where the meats are great, but the bread is terrible or vice versa.. . I had the Full Montague here.  The bread was fresh; it actually had a great crust and was chewy on the inside as well.  The right bread is the hardest thing to find in most places. The meat itself is top notch, and is just as good as Boar's Head branded meat, if it isn't actually Boar's Head.  I liked this place much better than Capriotti's; if you're a fan of hoagies from Philly or NY come here. . . This place always seem to have a super long line whenever I walk past, but it seems to move quickly.  They have call ahead ordering and I recommend doing that to skip the line.. . I'll definitely be back to try other sandwiches, and hope it's just as good as the Full Montague.
I came here because of the high rating and almost 4000 reviews!! Goes to show that doesn't always mean everything.. . The sandwiches were just ok.  "Meh" at best.  The meat is thin, processed cuts.  I had the Full Montagu and like I said, nothing to write home about.  Tasted the tuna melt and again, meh.  I've had better.  I think the number of reviews and high ratings comes from the late night, post-drinking clientele. . . Staff were friendly and food came out fast. Sandwiches were about $6.49.  Would I come back? Nope...unless I was broke and couldn't afford to eat better!
If you're not in the mood for a breakfast buffet, this place fits the bill. They have good options for breakfast and lunch. It could get crowded though during peak breakfast and lunch hours.
Pedestrian mass produced food. Was inspired by many of the positive reviews and tried it on a surprisingly quiet Friday evening. Girlfriend had a the BBQ chicken which tasted like rubber, and I had the original 1742. Nothing positive to say here for foodies, you can do better. I'd rather eat at McDonald's (and I don't). I agree with Liz K. "the number of reviews and high ratings comes from the late night, post-drinking clientele."
Two Words: Great Sandwiches. We came here for lunch while we were staying at Planet Hollywood.  We were just looking for a quick bite and this place is located right outside the casino, by the mall entrance; so it was very convenient. When we saw the line we almost changed our mind, but I'm glad we didn't.  The line moves very fast.  The people working at the counter were very friendly and helpful.  I got the chicken chipotle sandwich and it really hit the spot. The sandwiches are all about $7 and that is a pretty good price for a meal on the strip.
I was always get the chipotle avocado sandwich. Service is always great considering they serve so many customers. Earls is always a nice place to eat.
The Good. - Open 24/7, handy location (inside PH, right on the strip), inexpensive. - Most sandwiches are delicious and the bread is great too. . The Bad. - Seems like they've been skimping on the amount of meat/ingredients lately. - Lines can be dreadfully long, timing is everything. . Tips. - Don't forget about the salads like the Cobb, or the breakfast menu, especially their BLT ;)
Yesterday on a family trip to Vegas, we had nothing to eat. My sister suggested Earl of Sandwiches, but my dad at first resisted because he isn't a big fan of sandwiches. When we got there, the line was a bit lengthy but went pleasantly fast. Our sandwiches were nice and toasty (we got the Chicken Chipotle and Full Montagu), and after my dad took a few bites he said: "I want to go back to our hotel room, turn on the tv, and eat this sandwich.. That's my dream." As you can see, Earl of Sandwiches changed my dad's opinion about sandwiches with it's deliciousness! It is a great place to visit overall.
Had breakfast at the one in Planet Hollywood Casino.  It was pretty good.  Kind of greasy but makes good drunk food.
Last month my friends and I went here to grab something to eat. It was so tasty.  I would definitely go again! The line moved quickly. They had plenty of choices, and I  was so not hungry when I was finished at all.
My favorite sandwich spot in vegas! . . I recommend getting 'The Earl's Club' Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce is to die for!. . Never any regrets eating here, you won't be disappointed.
Its really good. Bread is soft. Chipotle chicken avocado is bomb. Salad fresh. Great value in vegas
Yum yum! One of the best sandwiches I've had!
Arrived in Vegas and was looking for an affordable place to eat.  Checked the reviews and ended up here, ordering the Original 1762 sandwich.. . The reviews are right, this is good!  The sandwich was made nice and hot, with just the right proportions of meat and horseradish.  The hoagie was crunchy on the outside and just right in the middle.  The price ain't too bad either.. . So why did I knock off one star? Most of the tables were dirty with trash on them.  Obviously they hadn't been cleaned since the previous patrons used them and I had a hard time finding a clean table to sit at.  This wasn't a busy time either.  While I ate, someone finally started to go around and clean the tables.  Despite this slight inconvenience, I'd certainly easy here again.
My husband and I shared The Full Montagu. The inside of the sandwich wasgooey and tasty as the bread was still crisp but not hard (we ate it about 30min after we got the sandwich). The lines moved rather quickly: 1.you order and a receipt is handed to you 2.move along the line, pay at the next register with anything you picked up along the way and you also order your cup for the fountain drinks at this register. They hand you another receipt and a buzzer.. 3. When your buzzer buzzes pick up your sandwich next to the paid register.. The only thing I wanted more of was the meat! There was hardly any meat in The Full Montagu. It's not something I would go back for or crave for but  is something light and close by that I can grab when at Planet Hollywood. It's good enough to fill me for an hour or two. Something to try but not a must.
Their sandwiches are decently priced for something on The Strip and it is very good. I tried the tuna , philly cheese steak, and the reuben sandwich. I think my favorite is the tuna sandwich because I love the creamy texture and taste of it. Least favorite is the philly cheese sandwich because I've tried better ones from Subway and other sandwich shops. The cheese was not melted and I like my cheese to be melted. The bread was toasted just the way I like it and it had just the right amount of crunchiness to it. I am in love with the bread.
Amazing sandwiches!  I had the Caprese, and my 8 year old son had the BBQ wrap.  Both were excellent!
I wish this place was closer to where I lived and more easily accessible!  I'm a sandwich fiend and Earl of Sandwich does not disappoint.  So.  Freakin.  Good.
the earl club is so good! a warm turkey sandwich with lettuce, tomato and dressing. it's the first item on the menu for a reason...order it!
Overrated just go to Quiznos or subway just being honest don't get me wrong food is good bot not amazing the drink section is nasty and dirty I live in Vegas I will never go out of my way to come to this place again
I always make a stop here when I'm in Vegas or Anaheim. You know when food is so good that having it in your presence alone makes you happy? The sandwiches are so delicious that is exactly how it makes me feel. Just be prepared to wait in line!
Popular sandwich place, located on the Vegas strip. This is a chain restaurant and the menu is usually the same between them. It is always crowded and sometimes finding a table is difficult. They also offer salads, baked goods and smoothies. Service is usually fair and food is slightly above average. Though the Vegaslocation could use someone cleaning the tables in the dining area. If looking for sandwiches, it is worth a try.
After dayclubbing and you get the drunchies, there is nothing better than Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood. Some people like drunchies to be unplanned, but my trip to Earl of Sandwich was definitely planned days before. The line was relatively long, probably took over 20 minutes from standing in line to sitting down and devouring my sandwich but the wait was so worth it!. . I got three different sandwiches: the chipotle chicken avocado, the tuna melt and the hawaiian bbq! YES - a small girl like me had to have three, but of course I didn't eat them all in one sitting. Honestly, if my boyfriend didn't stop me, I would have gotten a dozen of these sandwiches to-go. They were simply too good and I can't even tell you which one is my favorite because all three were amazing!!! . . There are plenty of seating but as you can imagine, the lines are long and there are always a lot of people so seating may be hard to find. I didn't have trouble finding a seat for two, but that was at 3pm, which is more of a lunner hour instead of normal eating hours. . . TRUST ME. GO HERE. IT IS BOMB!!. . I think I'm gonna have to head to downtown disney this week just to get some of these sandwiches.
They no longer carry the cannonballs! sandwich :(. So sad!. It is off their menu online too so this is probably a company wide change.. Also, I'm not sure when they made this other change, but no more ice cream sandwiches either! . . Even so, it's still a great place to grab a bite to eat at any time of the day.
Open 24 hours and affordable delicious hot sandwiches.. what's not to love?!. I've been to Vegas many many times and we always end up eating here atleast once during our trip.  The line can get really long, but dont worry.. from experience, they move pretty fast!  The menu here consists of several different types of sandwiches... . . I've had the:. Earls Club. The Full Montagu*. Tuna Melt. Chipotle Chicken Avocado. Hawaiian BBQ*. Caribbean Jerk Chicken*. meatball one (Forgot the name). . The ones with the * are my favorite ones :)  The sandwiches are made pretty fast.. you get a buzzer that buzzes when your order is ready.  Aside from sandwiches, they also have wraps, soups, macaroni salad, coleslaw, fruit cups, cookies, muffins and other baked goods.  The coleslaw here is pretty good to eat with your sandwiches too.. . Price is very affordable compared to most of the food joints in Vegas.. plus it's at a very convenient location.. found in Planet Hollywood on the strip.. and there's even a Sugar factory and Fat Tuesday near by :)
This place is always consistent no matter what I order. The people that work here give great suggestions depending on what you're in the mood for. Brownie ice cream sandwich is the best thing I've ever had in my life.
Seriously one of the reason I love staying at Elara so much is how close and convienent it is to Earl's! Only a 10 minute walk or if I'm desperate, a 5 minute fast-walk dodging innocent pedestrians. Earl's is my go to meal in Vegas. You cant beat the price and quality. I've done many a vegas trips surviving off only Earl's.. A typical schedule consist of - Arrive in Vegas, grab Earl's for dinner. Eat half - take a Tabasco for the road. Go clubbing. Come home starving - finish the other half that night or the next morning. Wake up. Day Club. Earl's.. Really what more do you need? Order the Caprese Sandwhich - no meat but still incredibly filling and flavorful. The soups are great too if your too exhausted to conquer a sandwhich first. Great cold, hot, or microwaved the next day!
Jerk chicken sandwich is great.  If you are in vegas go here.  My fav place after in-n-out burger :). . one sandwich might not be enough.  Just a word of caution
Me and my boyfriend waited in line for about 10-15 minutes before we made it up to the register. This was around 230pm on a Saturday.. . Once we got to the front we ordered the original and chipotle chicken sandwiches, along with a cup of their amazing tomato soup.. . We waited about another 5-10 minutes before a staff member handed us our bag. We saw right away that there were 3 sandwiches (not 2) and we were missing the soup. How could they mix that up? We showed the staff our receipt and they gave us the soup.. . When we got back to the Cosmo to eat, we found that they had given us 2 of the originals (they basically made one of our sandwiches twice). Sweet deal... . The roast beef on the original was extremely chewy though, and I had to spit out a lot of the meat. The 4 star review is really for the soup and the chipotle chicken sandwich which were amazing. Beware of tough roast beef!
Vegas is known for its countless high-end buffets and celebrity chef owned restaurants, but Earl of Sandwich is one place that I always look forward to eating. I always get The Original roast beef sandwich or the Chipotle Avocado Chicken sandwiches depending on what I'm feeling like. Their turkey chili is also delicious. Yum yum yum!
I love Thanksgiving food. The holiday turkey is sooo good! Like thanksgiving in the form of a sandwich. For $6.49 per sandwich, this is probably one of the cheapest, tastier meal options you'll find in the Las Vegas Strip. Lines moved promptly. I'm already planning of my return here before I hit the airport. I want to try some of their other delicious tasting sandwiches but damn that holiday turkey was bomb! I already know that's gonna be my last Vegas meal. Their cole slaw ($2.49) was ok. Pretty good but not great.
Sandwich chip and drink for under 12 bucks. Not bad when need a quick bite. I usually get tge earl club add avocado. Delish! Even the kettle chip bag is delish. During rush hour gets real busy. You place your sandwhich order in front n they give you a receipt with a buzzer. you move down the line grabbing whatever you also want. pay cashier and wait for buzzer go off. overall good hot sandwich.
Love, love, love this spot!  One of my favorite things about staying at Planet Hollywood is being so close to Earls.  This delicious sandwich spot is open 24 hours... How convenient!. . Sanwiches- I've tried most sandwiches on the menu and they've all been amazing.  They're always hot, fresh, and delish.  My personal favorites are the chipotle chicken and veggie sandwich. . . Wraps- They're fresh but nothing as tasty as the sandwiches.. . Salads- Small in size, but tasty. Try the Cobb.. . Baked Goods- ahhhh.... The cookies are moist and rich.  Although I'm usually a huge fan of chocolate chip cookies, the sugar cookie was my favorite in this case.  . . Don't let the long line discourage you!  They move pretty quickly, especially during the day.
These sandwiches are amazing. The perfect bun to sauce to meat ratio. Why have I not tried these sandwiches before??? The full montagu, earls club, and chicken avacado were all full of deliciousness.. . It's open 24 hours. Be prepared for long line ups. It's worth the wait!
When it comes to good sandwiches, you can't beat Earl's!. . I come to Vegas twice a year for SHOT Show and the USN Gathering (Knife Show) and two things are always guaranteed: A stay at Planet Hollywood and a sandwich from here.. . I've had just about everything on the menu and have never had a bad experience here. I like the Original and the Jerk Chicken the best.. . You can't beat the price and can often get out of here spending less than $10
Full disclosure, I haven't eaten in at this place yet, but we've catered out a couple of times.  I like the sandwiches in general, with the exception of a couple of the flavors.  My favorites are the Jamaican Jerk chicken, and the Original (roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish).  Unfortunately, the portions are kind of small and I think the prices are a little expensive for what you get.  That being said, the flavors are definitely there for a quick fast-food sandwich.
The best and cost effective quick bite in PH!
Good for the price. Tasty sandwiches ( ham and swiss, chipotle avocado) that will make a good cheap meal, as these kinds of prices are tough to find inside casinos. The Mac n cheese was bland and I would have liked more meat per sandwich however. It's a popular spot, so expect a line, and a wait to find a seat.
Short version: Cheap sandwich that will fill your hunger hole without regrets.. . Longer version: Came here with part of a Bachelorette group after reading the reviews. We had spent all day pool-side at the Tropicana but didn't feel like spending $15 for a simple sandwich. For $7, we each got a perfectly sized sandwich to stop the hunger monster without breaking the bank. I got the Italian and would eat it again. Was it the best sandwich I have ever experienced? Eh... No, but it was still delicious. Food that leaves room for more alcohol? I'm calling that a win, Las Vegas.
Soo good. Tried many of the menu items between the group and loved everything. Soup, sandwiches, salads, and wraps were all delicious! It's located right in the middle of the strip inside of the Miracle Mile Mall, next to planet Hollywood. It's a very casual place so you can go anytime!!! We made multiple stops here during our trip as there was plenty to try! Must visit if you're on the strip!!
The Skinny: . Awesome sandwich joint open late with a self-proclaimed "world famous" tagline that lives up to their hype!. . Environment:. This place was in one of the casinos so the environment is... well it's Vegas, what else do you want? They have some tables for seating, and since most people come and go fast, it isn't that hard to find seating.. . Service:. Mostly service is consisted of the cashiers and the sandwich makers. There isn't much to say about the customer service for the tabling because that doesn't really matter here.. . Food:. Amazing sandwich! I got the hot turkey sandwich because I wanted to try out the cranberry sauce and stuffing since one of my favorite sandwiches is the Bobbie atCapriotti's of Culver City. Man... the sandwich at Earl surpassed my past experiences with that kind of sandwich elsewhere! It was very balanced and did not sog up the bread, but it kept it moist at just the right amount. The balance kept the flavor in without an over dryness of bread. My friends got other hot sandwiches and it seemed everyone liked their sandwiches. Some came by again the next day!. . Overall: 4/5. Good place for sandwiches, you should definitely try this place for a small bite when in Vegas.
I've wanted to try this place for years, and finally did today.  Wow, why didn't I try it sooner?  I wasn't super hungry, so my spouse and I shared the club.  It was great, perfectly warm, yet the lettuce was still cool and crisp.  That is an accomplishment.  They even let me try the tomato soup before I ordered it.  It was really good too, but I know it has dairy in it.  Its too creamy to be vegan( I'm not vegan, just warning you).   Its a major value in an expensive city( on the strip) too.  12.00 for a sandwich, soup and chips.  Be warned though, they only have pepsi products.
I had heard of this place many times before. It is the "best sandwich" you'll ever have, you "HAVE to eat here", etc etc.   I thought I'd be let down because that's A LOT of hype for just a sandwich shop but it met the hype and I WANT it NOW as I type this review!!. . LOCATION: This one is located at Planet Hollywood. PH is kind of big and I was still disoriented a bit but if you enter from the strip, walk through the casino and look for the big huge "YOLO's sign" and Earn of Sandwich is right across from it. . . We went around 1pm on Friday and the line was kind of long but don't freak out because it goes really quick. You order your sandwich at the left and can pick up brownies and other things at the counter to the right. You pay there/give them your free brownie code and they'll give you a buzzer thing so you can find seating while you wait. . . We went again on Sunday around 11:30am/12pm and the line wrapped around the front of the restaurant. Took maybe 10mins to order. Both times after we paid, it took 5 -10 mins to get our food.  We were lucky both times and there was plenty of seating too. . . FOOD: Since we were planning on going to a buffet for dinner, my bf and I split a chipotle chicken avocado - 6.49 (Grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce).  OMG it was SO good. The cheese was perfectly melted and so gooey. The bread was toasted and the perfect amt of crisp on the outside and soft enough on the inside. The chicken was so moist and juicy and was a perfect combo of flavors with the avocado, bacon and sauce! The half sandwich was so not enough.. granite we were hungry and just did this to get us through the buffet but after I had the first bite I knew we'd have to come back before we left Vegas. . . The second time we went on Sun- my bf got the Chipotle Chicken Avocado again and I got the The Full Montagu - 6.49 (Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce). We both had half of each other's sandwiches and still hands down the CCA was the better one. The FM was really good too though! That roast beef was so soft and juicy too! . . We got a free brownie both times and it was good. It's more a cake-like brownie and I love those! I was thinking it would be too dense because they're triple chocolate but it was just right! Totally tasted freshly baked, soft and a perfect way to end your meal. Plus you can't beat free! . . First time to try it and I LOVED IT. My friends told me they opened one in Anaheim (about 45 mins from where I live in LA) .... may be worth the drive for this place! It's def not "just" a sandwich like you know.. it's earned it's Earl of Sandwich title :D. . Thank you yelpers for bringing this one up for cheap eats in Vegas! Worth it!. . . TIPS AND SUCH. ---------------. Full menu here: http://www.planethollywoodresort.com/content/dam/phv/Dining/Casual/earl-of-sandwich/eos-october-2013.pdf. . Sign up for the mailing list for a FREE BROWNIE: http://www.earlofsandwichusa.com/the-eclub/. . It took about a day to get the confirm email.  Inside the email, there'll be a link to open that has a barcode for the cashier to scan for the free brownie.  We went twice while we were in Vegas so we just split one brownie each time.  The first time, it didn't scan so they keyed it in. The second time we went I just showed it to them and they didn't bother scanning it. I'd get that brownie next time even if it wasn't free
Finally tried this place! I didn't even know it was in our hotel!. . Anyways, I got the chicken avocado club and was recommended the BBQ pork. I ordered both for myself for the ride to the airport. . . The chicken club was amazing! The BBQ was just not enough pork. I took off half the bread and folded it. . . Can't wait to try more sandwiches!
Best sandwich I've ever had it was not, but it was still really good.  I think my wife hyped it up too much.  It's definitely better than subway, but it also reminded me a lot of quizno's.  Go ahead and boo me all you want with those comparisons, but that's what I felt like.  I had the chipotle chicken and it came out warm, melty, cheesy, and full of chicken, but for what I was paying for, it was kind of small, maybe a 6 inch sandwich. Perfect location inside the shops at Planet Hollywood, we saw many sober and not so sober folks enjoying their sandwiches.  Don't let the loud music from the bar across the way deter you late at night, or maybe it will guide you their way to keep on partying after you enjoy your sandwich late into the morning since they are open 24 hours.
I just love this place. I always get the holiday sandwich! I tried their macaroni and cheese this time and it was delish. The boyfriend got chipotle chicken with avocado sandwich which is also a great choice!
Line moved really quickly. They had a pretty organized system. They hand out a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready but by the time I was ready to pay my sandwich was done.. . I ordered the tuna melt and the chipotle chicken avocado. Probably two of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life. The tuna melt had melted cheese that was oozing with every bite. The chipotle sandwich is a must get and is made to perfection.
Nothing to say that hasn't already been said. . . This place is awesome.
Never disappoints. Conveniently located next to the sportsbook. I was about to list my favorite sandwiches but it's easier to just say they're all good. If a sandwich on the board catches your eye or tickles your fancy while you're in line but you're not sure if you should get it, rest assured. It will be a delicious sandwich. Last weekend I ate half of my club sandwich, stuck it in a fridge, took it out, drove home, and it still tasted fantastic.
Food is wonderful but staff was very rude!. I got pastrami it was made perfect!  Tried the original also great! And so was tomato soup
Anyone who gives this place more than three stars without being drunk needs to have their head examined. I appreciate that there's an affordable option on the Strip, but most casinos have a food court or casual eatery on site somewhere, so price really isn't enough to nudge this into the extra-stars category.. This is basically a slightly-nicer Quizno's.. . Earl of Sandwich is a chain that offers (what else?) sandwiches: warm or cold, with side options like chips and cookies, and the occasional soup or salad. While some rave about their bread, I guess I've gone on the wrong days because it didn't blow my mind.. . The original is tasty, though I prefer a very light touch with my horseradish. It's refreshing to see a caprese on a fast-food menu, but the bread texture/density doesn't complement the delicate components of this particular sandwich.. . But the fact that this place is rated one of the top five places to dine in Vegas based on star score and number of reviews is downright insulting to the hundreds of phenomenal restaurants we have, even including ones that are not celebrity-chef-owned or expensive.
I ate here a long time ago but forgot to review this place.. The chipotle chicken avocado sandwich was really good, warm, and had a nice tangy sauce. The line was very long but went faster than I thought. Take me back to Las Vegas!!
I can see why this place has a line...probably because of the decent price and the small bites of made to order sandwiches. Eating buffet day and night in Vegas makes me tired so I was glad that we discovered this place. The original I got was yummy and I finish within a few minutes..felt like a snack to me but it was enough. Will try a different one next time...but which one?
I stayed at Aria and realized this place wasn't too far of a walk.  Sure, there are plenty of places to eat in Aria, but you're paying double the price, easily.  . . I was able to try a few of the sandwiches and picked up some breakfast sandwiches for the airport (just in case).  I hate hanger.  . . Some sandwiches were definitely better than others.  My favourites were the chicken chipotle and the full montagu.  For the price and taste, not bad.  . . These things don't travel well though.  Eat them fresh and on the premises, otherwise, they drop down to two stars.
The bread is baked as your sandwich is made.  Got the Reuben  sandwich.  Put all of the fillings on one half, the pastrami was tasty, but the sandwich fillings have gotten skimpier over the years.  LONG lines around lunchtime.. . Still a good sandwich if you are willing to wait.
