Just spent 4 days here with the family and would return.  It has more of a resort feel than a casino.  I would describe this place as a casino for responsible adults and well suited and designed for families and keeping kids off the casino floor. Wave Pool is a must. Pool area does have some boozers around, so be ready to deal with a few drunks now and again.. . Here are some savings tips.. #1...if you have a family, get a double queen and register one adult and one kid at checkin.  They have a silly policy of charging $35/additional person past two people in a room.  The check in area is huge, so just have your family sit down in the middle and save yourself a bogus fee.. #2...for the Lazy River, buy an inner tube at CVS, but make sure it is a round inner tube, not a Shamu or animal floaty.  Those won't be allowed.  The hotel inner tubes are $25/each.  At CVS, it's $10. #3...Breakfast at the Ri Ra Pub in the hotel is hearty and good and only $10-$11/per person.. #4...Dad's...at the pool, hit up the IPA cart for good beer.  Avoid the waitresses serving domestics.  . #5...buy bottled water at the CVS along with sun block.  bottled waters at the pool are $7/each.. #6...self parking is easy.  Park on level 5 or higher to find open spots near the hotel entrance.. #7...Try Burger Bar restaurant with some friends.  Great burgers and drinks.
Spent a weekend here and loved it. It helps that I did well at craps!  The pools are nice (a bunch of them so good for people looking for seclusion, party, or family). The restaurants and bars are good. The rooms are nice and clean (can hear neighbors a bit though).  Decently priced.  Cool story: my fiance's ring lost the main diamond in the pool, and a lifeguard spent an hour looking and found it! That meant a lot to us, so thank you!. I recommend!
WARNING!!! . Check your room for cleanliness before you go to bed. When I checked I I was lead to a room that really stunk of cigarettes. Was a smoking room  but, didn't expect it to reek. After a long crummy day of travel I went to lay down and noticed hair ALL over the bed. So I looked closer to find blood stains on the pillows and sheets. YUCK! Went down stairs to complain and when I asked for a manager the desk clerk did every song and dance in the book to not let me talk to someone. So I had to pull out the pictures of the bloody pillows to finally get a manager. So they changed my room to a smaller room with a crummy view.. Which made no sence to me but, I was tired and wanted to crash.. Looked at the bed and AGAIN HAIR ALL OVER THE SHEETS AND GLITTER LIKE A DIRTY STRIPPER ROLLED AROUND IN THE BED BEFORE I GOT THERE. Took over 3 hrs to get the second room cleaned. Brought a large amount of money to gamble with but after the crummy luck with the rooms didn't feel lucky anymore.. Didn't gamble one penny at the casino I stayed in....and I was there for 6days... Would never go back.. There are way to many great hotels in Vegas to stay at this place again...
A M B I A N C E: Cigarette smoke, cigar-smoking gangster types, families, babies, shouts, hollers, boos, yelps and even a human bark thrown in for good measure, cowboy hats, large bosoms, bros with face tattoos, rhinestones, and the sound of slot machines dinging, as grannies go for the gold! There's Craps tables, and the Lotus Room for the high rollers. My favourite game: Willy Wonka! Don't fault me! I won! Several times! Plus, the one with the diamonds and crystals! J A C K P O T for Asli! Going granny style! Yay for me! . . R O O M S: I had to stay here one night because of a mix-up. The room is big, roomy and comfortable, relatively clean, save for the random unused condom I found near the refrigerator. Blech. [Side note: I have found some questionable items whilst here in Las Vegas, including a number of unmentionables, and piles of escort cards, shaped like collectible baseball cards. These sweaty men slap these decks on the Strip to get your attention to go to their escort / stripper / topless bars. Excuse the digression.]. . L U N C H B R E A K: Citizens Kitchen & Bar and House of Blues, plus Kumi take the cake!. . T H E Y 'V E G O T W H A T I N H E R E?: There's a wedding chapel, here, in case you found 'the one', and an attached wedding photography studio. Don't miss out on the Shark Reef near the Wave Pool. The Press Cafe serving Lavazza coffee and the Cardio Room are a great respite from the hectic and heady movement. There is a full-on shopping mall. It would be easy to spend your entire time simply exploring the property, without leaving. I imagine that's what they want you to do.
This casino may be at the edge of the Strip, but it's my favorite of all of them.. . So many have a weird smell or a snooty vibe, but this one is perfect for me.  It's laid out well (I've never gotten lost here), and the parking garage actually makes sense (which is rare).  I usually get lost in the garages or in the casinos, but this one is easy to navigate.. . I've been here for Shark Reef a couple of times and also for conferences.  I've also just gone to hang out with friends visiting from out of town.  It's on the classier side without being overly full of itself (KWIM?), and it's not cheesy like some of the others (Circus, Circus and Harrahs).  It's upscale without being pompous.  Just classy.  Clean. Calm.  Love it.
We stayed at Mandalay Bay 8/2-5 and had a great time. We had the 'Great Room Suite' and the room was fantastic. Very large and a nice view. All the staff (Front desk, Bellman, Concierge and Maids) were very friendly, helpful and respectful. The swimming pools were a lot of fun also as was the casino except for the fact I left there with fewer $ than I started with.. . We ate at several restaraunts on site including Wolfgang Puck's 'Lupo' restaraunt and the 'Border Grille' (both were very good and the staff was friendly) as well as Citizen's (which I was disappointed in both their service and overpriced food). We reserved a table Saturday night at the '1923 Bourbon & Burlesque' club and my wife said this was one of her favorite parts of the trip. The music and dancers were very entertaining and the bartenders were great. It was a fun crowd.. . We visited several other hotels while we were there to catch some shows and most did not compare to Mandalay. The only downside is that Mandalay is at the end of the strip so you eiether have to take the tram (which is not bad), take a taxi, or walk a long way. We would definitely stay at Mandalay again as it was upscale and very clean but based upon our observations our second choice would be the Cosmopolitan or Caesars Palace as they were both very nice and more towards the center of the strip.
Decided at the last minute to come here for our 20th wedding anniversary. First to see the Michael Jackson ONE show and also to see this beautiful resort. Sean Reilly at the front desk was very helpful in accommodating my wife and I for our special occasion.
Made reservations 5 months in advance over the phone. Booked a king bed over looking the strip over the phone. We show on a Tuesday only to find out that they only have 2 queen beds facing the desert. Really? After much complaining in which they try and tell me that a reservation is not a guarantee, they give $50 in comp money which is about 4 drinks worth. Really! The pool is nice except for the "constant" drone of the sight seeing helicopters overhead.  Go to a show in their sister casino MGM on a wed night. The show finishes at 11. Go back to the tram that connects the three other MGM properties, which includes Mandalay only to find out that is stopped running at 11. Are you kidding, this is Vegas not some sleepy town in the Midwest somewhere. Take the indoor moving sidewalk back, of which half of them are not running and the other half where disgustingly dirty that you would not want to touch without getting a tetanus shot.   Never again.
This is a good casino to check out while in Vegas. There is a free monorail from the x- caliber to here. There are many cool shops inside, with a few sport/entertainment shops that are worth walking through.
Just checked in and already off to a bad start. Tried for a complimentary upgrade and was lied to my face saying that both hotels were booked up, when I heard the agent next to us offer a suite upgrade in the Delano to the people next to me. I'm over it since my rooms were comped anyway.. But a total let down and still disappointing. THEN when I was trying to get into my room after check in our keys didn't work... We had to wait 15 minutes for the Mandalay security to come up and check my identification and let us in... By this time I am heated because it's such an inconvenience that I'm standing outside and waiting while I need to get ready to attend a show. Now I'm inside the room and have been waiting for 30 minutes and we need to get going ASAP and our new keys are still not up here... I call again and I ask to get them rushed, so I hope they arrive soon or the monster in me is going to come out again and in their faces downstairs at the desk!. . The room itself is standard and is on the nicer side so I don't have any complaints about the room. It comes with a shower and tub off to the side. Bed is comfy and tv is a good size. Overall I wouldn't mind staying here again if it's free and they work on improving these little flaws of theirs.
Arrived at the hotel. The valets were great dealing with my big truck. Check in was easy and the room was clean, except for the dingy carpet. Next morning I was unable to find a Red Bull. I like Red Bull but the only Red Bull was in the mini bar for seven dollars. I walked to the Shell station and got one. Then I met up with the kids and went to Mandalay Beach. Whoa. Huge crowd and my son was too short for the over hyped wave pool.Next time we will find another hotel with a nice mellow pool and Red Bull,as Mandalay Bay is not Red Bull friendly.But I should add every single member of the Mandalay Bay staff was friendly and helpful, always smiling.
I liked the location of Mandalay Bay. It is set off a little from the chaos of the strip but still in walking distance.
Just returned from a 3 night stay at Mandalay Bay. We had a great time. Room was beautiful and clean. Housekeeping did a great job. Stayed in a Deluxe Suite Room, which had 3 TVs and 2 separate bathrooms. Room was so new, that the part of the hotel we stayed in was still being worked on. We had a beautiful panoramic view of the city, it just took our breath away.  . . We ordered room service the first night and they informed us that it would take 45-60 minutes.  It ended up taking the 60 minutes, which was fine, because they did let us know in advance. Food arrived hot and was tasty. Air conditioning worked great and bedding was clean and we slept soundly. The room had robes, slippers, a large light up makeup mirror, and even a scale . Parking was easy and convenient with large spaces to park your car. I have a new car and always worry that someone is going to ding my car, but as I said, spaces were large.. . Pool was a little cold both days we used the pool. . . I gave the hotel 4 stars instead of 5 because of the construction and the hotel could have done a better job with the signage. Hotel is large and a couple of times we got confused as to how to find our room. There just was not enough signs and sometimes I felt we were going in circles. However, staff was always helpful with directions.. . Hotel is on the outskirts of Las Vegas Blvd, but they do have a tram that will take you to a few of the neighboring hotels. Lots of stores and places to eat.. . I felt the price was not bad for what we got. . . We will be back!
Can't complain had a great time here. Hotel was very nice. Room was spacious and clean. Hotel pool was awesome! Overall the hotel was a great choice.
The wave pool is a lot of fun!!! 4.5 Stars.. . Overall, I give 3 stars because there r way too many families with kids at this hotel.  . . (I generally enjoy the absence of kids in Vegas as an "adult playground".). . The hotel has a good variety of restaurants.  We like Red Square (although their drinks tend to be too fruity).. . During the week, its a good value.  90$ (plus that ridiculous "resort fee" all the hotels are scamming people with now).
Rooms are pretty decent large rooms andvery big bathroom with separate shower and tub. Some of the upholstery is showing it's wear. My only complaint is the wifi sucks and I can't get a good signal. I also thought the room was noisy meaning you can hear your neighbors. My friend had the same complaint when he stayed here also. I recommend you ask for a room that is not connected by door to your neighbor. I would ask for a quiet room.
This hotel is awesome. Great room, comfy beds, very nice bathroom, nice sized flat screen, the pool is outstanding! I know I will stay here next time I'm in Vegas..very nice hotel and no other one can top that pool! Until next time Mandalay
(This is probably 3.5 stars to me.)  Mandalay Bay may have the largest water budget in Las Vegas (despite the 'lake' at the Bellagio) to keep the grounds so beautifully green!  The inside of the hotel is bright and airy, and it's probably the nicest-smelling Las Vegas hotel, with the scent of orchids everywhere.  (I don't know whether that's natural from the plentiful orchids on the main floors or if it's artificial, but it smells great!)  The staff is efficient -- possibly because Mandalay Bay lacks the constant crowds of the more central Strip hotels -- although they seemed to gush over people I assumed (from biased observation) were high rollers (or at least higher rollers than my room indicated I was) while relatively perfunctorily taking care of me.. . The halls of the room floors are bright and clean.  The room I was in was a good size, simply and tastefully done in browns, tans, and occasional steel.  There was a surprising amountof closet space.  The large bathroom has separate areas for most things (even splitting the shower and the large, deep bathtub); one caution is that in my room the bathroom had a large, partially frosted (in vertical lines) glass window between it and the entrance hallway in the room -- if that's the case in all the rooms, know that any roommates will be able to see you bathing or dressing.  My fourth floor room was relatively loud from a combination of building air conditioning units right outside, general noise -- cars, airplanes -- though the thin windows, and the thin walls and doors.. . Mandalay Bay's casino is a decent size, with a wide variety of games and minimum bets.  There are a _lot_ of restaurants around the hotel and the Mandalay Place area between the Mandalay Bay and the Luxor, plus a decent array of shops in Mandalay Place.. . I'm glad I stayed here once -- and would be willing to again if travel companions wanted to -- but I wasn't as blown away as I'd hoped to be, so for the price I'll probably look elsewhere the next time.
Staff at the Mandalay Pool, bungalow servers a SPECTACULAR!! Pricey but worth the splurge!! Thanks!
Now 0/3 in the customer service department on my last three visits to Mandalay Bay I'm beginning to wonder why I continue to go back; from the frankly disastrous experience at StripSteak to an overpriced and underwhelming night at Rx Boiler Room followed by a server bluntly highlighting her 'expected' tip at Slice of Vegas I'm really not sure what sort of hiring process is going on here.. . Perhaps more convenient for locals than other central-Strip environs with ample parking and good highway access I simply cannot see much reason for a return visit at this point and although perhaps a trek to the Four Season's Brunch or a second look at Ducasse once the Delano rebrand is complete is in order I'm not exactly placing either on the top of my 'to-do' list, all things considered.
Awesome rooms and awesome casino. Food and beverages are a little pricey and if there's a convention happening in the hotel forget about finding a place to eat there. Beach and pools are the best you can find on the strip
This used to be my go to Las Vegas resort.. . The gambling area is spacious with high ceilings and good ventilation. There are not a lot of Video poker machines, but a good variety of the latest slots. The sports book is impressive, but located next to the main Theater. Auto shuffle blackjack pays 6-5 but Shoes are still the traditional 2-1.. . The wave pool, lagoons, and lazy river are great. Don't being more than a room key when visiting the beach area because I have encountered and seen many security issues there.. . The front desk is not reactive to customer concerns. It takes patience while dealing with them or they will spoil your vacation.. . The deluxe rooms are spacious with great views of the strip, pool, or airport. They have a large soaking tub, so visiting LUSH in the nearby shops for bath salts is a must.. . This is not a high end resort. Think Embassy Suites (which I like) with less than stellar service.
Rooms are very dimly lit and towels with shredded edges. I asked to be moved and opted for an upgrade at an extra $50/nite. In my haste to leave the room, I discovered an hour later that I left a valuable in the old room. Within that hour, it disappeared and was not turned in to security. After three days of checking in for it and a front desk clerk that basically told me I was making up stories (since they had not made record of my report in their system), I have decided the customer service here bites. The only saving grace of this hotel was the wave pool and lazy river. I would not recommend this hotel for friends and family.
I write this review being very torn.   The Mandalay Bay is a nice property with nice rooms.  We had a 2 queen room and it was very comfortable.  The room was large and clean.  The beds were comfortable.  I really like the space in the bathroom as well.  The A/C was really cold, when it worked, and there were times, always during the night, where the A/C would not cool.  The reason I am torn about this property is that I got food poisoning during my stay there.  I know it was from somewhere in the Mandalay Bay because that is the only place we ate all weekend.  I know that food bourne illnesses happen but it is the way it was handled that I am not happy about.  I did file a report and that was it.  I have since gotten a call from corporate but they said they are investigating and I haven't heard back from them.  Overall, nice property to stay but eat somewhere else.
LOVED my stay here last weekend. My boyfriend and I were in town to celebrate an anniversary and a friend's 30th birthday and I felt well taken care of at every point in our stay with them. The check-in was easy. The room was spacious, well appointed and very clean. The Mix Lounge and Mix restaurant were two of the top evening highlights of my trip (great views!!). The pools were wonderful and the cabana and lounge chair staff were amazing. We went to the Planet Hollywood pool one of the days to meet up with our friends and I instantly wished I was back at Mandalay Bay for the impeccable customer service. . . Never had a bad meal, and never had a bad customer service experience. Special shout out to concierge Joshua Worthy who helped me on multiple days of our stay and always remembered our last conversation even after speaking with what I'm sure was hundreds of other people. . . Will definitely be staying here again!
Came here for the aquarium. Was an interesting little exhibit. Saw lots of big fish and sharks. There was this one part of the exhibit where it looked like a sunk ship and you could see all the fishies!
Loved the hotel and service.. Great family hotel for Vegas, more of a resort! My son and daughter loved the pool area, especially the lazy river. I also enjoyed the pool area, they serve goose island beer and the pool restraint food and service was great! Restaurants options are plenty We tried the casual dining Johnny rockets, Starbucks, and room service, as well as several upscale restaurants. Kids enjoyed the shark reef and the tram to Luxor and Excalibur. . . The negatives:Check in was a crazy long line. We had early check in and used the mlife Member line, but it was still too long of a wait. Price was a bit high, 1,300 for a three night stay with a strip view. Casino was a bit dead at night, older crowd not as much excitement as Bellagio or Ceasers  palace.    Other wise would give 5 stars.
