Excellent burgers and fare.  Fun atmosphere.  Highly recommend. . . Be prepared to wait 60-90 minutes.  They don't take reservations.  Best idea is to rotate the waiting position with a small group of friends and check out the other shops surround it, or grab a drink and wait.. . Great staff.  Family friendly. Clean.
Loves the poblano peppers! We ordered three orders to keep enjoying them! Tasty food!
Went here late Friday night to get a bite (10pm).  Sat at the bar and was served quickly.  Got the sliders which were small, but cooked to perfection.  Medium, seasoned well and not too squished so the texture was good.  Got a side of hangover sauce for the fries which was great.  Spicy ketchup was also really good.  Not the typical ketchup + cocktail sauce. More complex flavor. Very attentive bar manager.  Would eat here again in a second.
delicous burgers. Hubbie liked the buffalo one. I got the mini trio. Shakes great as well. It's in the mall area.
The hype is true, Burger Bar is the best place in Vegas for a Burger. Must have the buffalo on onion bread. Once you're done devouring your creation take a walk in order to make room for dessert. Create your own milkshake with liquor. Awesome service.
For me, Burger Bar was an intended destination -- not an accidental find.  I went specifically because I am a fan of Chef Hubert Keller and wanted to sample his take on burgers.  I really enjoyed it.. . FOOD. Because it's Hubert Keller, I was expecting an "elevated" burger, which seems to be a trend amongst respected chefs.  My burger fit the bill.  I took advantage of the "create your own burger" option on the menu.  You can choose from three different types of beef (angus, nature source, or Kobe), lamb, or buffalo.  Then choose from six types of buns.  Then choose from a seemingly endless menu of cheeses, sauces, and additional items.  My creation: the naturesource patty with smoked gouda, bacon, fried egg, peppercorn sauce on a pretzel bun.  I ordered it "medium" and was told that Burger Bar's medium is red inside, not just pink.  This was an accurate description -- and perfect!  My particular burger did not come with sides, but if you order from a chef's creations section, fries are included.. . One friend in my party had chicken wings (delicious).  Another ordered the "Hubert Keller" burger which was made with buffalo and served with skinny fries.  She enjoyed it.  Another friend created a "healthier" and enjoyed it (though she said he liked Burgr by Gordon Ramsey better; I have not been there, so I have no comparison.). . We ordered steak fries and fried pickles for sides.  Both were great.. . They also pride themselves on their shakes.  We did not try these or any type of dessert.. . AMBIENCE. It's...fine -- nothing elaborate or terribly unique.  Burger Bar is in the middle of the Mandalay Place shops, and it feels like a mall restaurant.  It's comfortable enough, but don't expect award-winning design or a "cool" vibe.. . LOCATION. At the Mandalay Place shops between Mandalay Bay and Luxor.  If you're staying at either of these hotels, it's great and an easy walk.  For those going by car, I suggest using valet.  Easy.. . PRICES. Fair.  I think my burger was about $20 with all my extra add ons.  If you add sides, a salad, and a drink, you could easily be at about $30 per person.. . NUTSHELL. It's a good burger.  I've been to Holstein's at the Cosmo up the strip, and it's comparable as far as quality and price (though Holstein's is more of an atmospheric destination.)  You'll enjoy Burger Bar...but expect to pay just a little extra than a typical restaurant burger.
Stayed at Delano and my group decided to eat here for lunch due to the reviews it got. The food was decent, but I left disappointed as I expected better. . . I built my own burger and wanted it cooked medium. Unfortunately, my patty was closer to medium-well. For a restaurant that specializes in burgers, you would think they'd cook the burgers properly. The meat itself was nothing special and even kind of bland. They offer a good number of toppings that you can add on, but charge $1+ for each. The fries were standard and my girlfriend was unsatisfied with her fried zucchini.. . The service was a little lacking, however, it was noon and close to full capacity. I feel that our waitress didn't prioritize our table because we had a big group and her 18% tip was already guaranteed. I would not come back here in the future.
Really good burgers. My husband and I have decided to try burgers at different hotels and we are glad to have tried this place. I had the Vegas Vegan which I know isnt a "burger' but it sounded so good I had to try it. Portabello mushrooms and eggplant,yummy. My husband went for the Peppercorn burger and enjoyed it as well. Service was very good. Kinda loud but  not obnoxious. Good beer as well.I am confused by some reviews that say this is near the pool, it isnt. this is located in the Shoppes between Mandalay and Luxor, maybe the reviews are getting combined?
I wasn't that impressed. I ordered the Kobe burger and it was mediocre to say the least. I have not returned since.
Burgers are very tasty and hearty. The real treat is the awesome selection of milkshakes. Try the Salted Caramel. Truly marvelous.
We went to Burger Bar for a late afternoon snack. The kids got pasta which  was way better than what they had been served the night before at Verandah in the Four Seasons hotel. A perfect Caesar salad and excellent service as well,and Burger Bar is a good value. We'll go back again.
We were hungry for some good food while in Vegas.  During out search, I remembered that Hubert Keller has the Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay. So we went there. What a great decision!. . While we had to wait for about 45 minutes to be seated, but once we were seated, the service and the food blew us away. . . Our server was super nice, friendly, and attentive. The food server knew which of us ordered what, which I had not expected from such a casual place.  That's great service. . . The burgers were simply amazing!  I made my own burger for almost $21 but it was worth every penny!  It was honestly the best burger I've ever had. . . The drinks were also amazing as were the dessert milkshakes!!!. . We've been to Hubert Keller's famed Fleur de Lys - that was wonderful, and this is an even better experience!!
Best shake I have ever had in my life.. Enjoyed the cowboy shake as recommended by my server and ordered the Rossini burger medium rare. Skinny fries, zucchini, onion rings with house made ketchup.  Chipotle aoiloe, pesto and spicy ketchup.. Everything is amazing here and the service was great! Our waiter had fabulous recommendations.. I like how you can order the sauces individually.
EXCELLENT SERVICE, good food and great ambiance.  A bit too loud for my taste.  Not a place I would bring a child.  Prices are pricey!
i had the veggie burger with wheat bread and peperjack cheese and onion rings. it was a great first vegas meal while waiting to check in. prices were reasonable and the service was awesome. i would recommend this place if you're in the mood for a good burger and i would definitely eat her again.
We ate here based on a recommendation from a wonderful worker of this hotel. Seemed great. We came as a group of 4 on a Monday night. Not busy at all and was seated promptly.  We ordered some beers and waters along with appetizer. .fried pickles yummy. We got our drinks but no appetizers.  So in the meantime we ordered our food. Mind you our waiter was great however the food service was extremely slow. We built our own burgers and all but one person ordered med-well and the other well done. We figured since she orderd hers well that what was taking so long. We go out food and but into a raw mooing burgers.  My husband isn't one to cause a scene about returning food so we just ate what we could and prayed we didn't throw it up later. I wasn't happy at all. The 2 stars are for the server.
Muy delicioso. I love the fried pickles! I swear they are godsent.
The ambience is a little dark for my taste, I hate it when its so dim, I feel like they're trying to hide something. A little noisy, they have some music playing variety of current hits . its a decent size restaurant. I thought the hostess could have been a bit friendlier towards people waiting in line to be seated. My waitress was really nice at least. The sweet potato fries were good, lamb burger was a but gamey. They use Australian lamb and I have noticed that Australian lamb is the gamest, I prefer New Zealand lamb. Note to self not to order lamb if it's Australian lamb again.. . Next I'll just try the regular beef burgers
My husband and I had dinner here 2 nights ago. I got the buffalo burger and my husband got the nature source beef burger. The meat was good. We got it well done and the meat is still juice. My husband also got the pretzel bun and he liked it. I had the plain bun and it was good in a way that it is not the soggy kind. I asked for no pepper and no seasoning on my buffalo meat and they were able to accommodate that. I like my meat plain, that is just how I prefer. I usually feel that seasoned meat doesn't taste good as it masked the real meat taste.. . The only thing we didn't like as much was the shake. We shared the salted caramel and it really tasted salty. I know we should have expected that it is salty but didn't anticipate that it would be salty enough to make me feel thirsty! It was like after eating msg! The shake does have a secret sauce called " Fleur de sel" in it and I don't know if that sauce contain any msg or fermented soy as my throat was terribly dehydrated and very thirsty after the shake. The toffee syrup in the shake for sure contributed to its saltiness too. After we went home, I had to eat an avocado and a plum which were high in potassium to counteract the trauma. I usually eat high potassium food as a remedy if I accidentally eat food with msg or high sodium. So if you can't handle sodium well, don't order the salted caramel shake, try another flavor instead.. The burgers were satisfactory but it is not a "wow" yet so we can only give 3 stars here. Especially when we know another burger place serving naturesource beef meat as well, and they can accommodate no seasoning and I think that this other place grills the meat better too. Burger Bar is very pricey too when considering the size of the meat they offer on the burger, so one time try at Burger Bar is enough for us. It is not the place for us to go back again if we have a crave for burger or shake in the future, there are better options in town.
It was late Friday night and we were tired and hungry from walking all day along the strip. We were staying at the Delano so we didn't want to go far and found this restaurant still open in Mandalay Bay Shops. Owned by Hubert Keller, he is infamous in SF for his restaurant, Fleur de Lys (which recently closed) and for being on several shows such as Top Chef, Top Chef Masters, Top Chef All Stars, Top Chef Just Desserts and Secrets of a Chef (his own cooking show). It has a dark bar atmosphere with very dim lighting. The booths also have their own little TVs that you can change.. . Note: the pricing and some items on their website is different than on their menus.. . Our order:. Rossini: ($65) Kobe Style Wagyu Beef w/ sauteed Foie Gras and shaved Truffles on an Onion Bun w/ a Black Perigord Truffle Sauce. Build-your-own: (Total - $27.60) Buffalo Burger ($17.95) on a Pretzel Bun (+$1.50) Pepper Jack (+$1) Fried Egg ($1.95) Grilled Onion (+$1) BB Ketchup (+$0.95) Skinny Fries (+$3.25). Pink Monkey: ($8.75) Strawberry Ice Cream, fresh Banana & Strawberries topped w/Whipped Cream and added Malibu Banana (+$5.50). Crabbie Shake: ($11.50) Crabbies Ginger Beer served with a scoop of Lemon Sorbet and shaved Candied Ginger. . The kobe beef is ground in-house so I had my burger medium rare. It was very tender and juicy. Loved how much of the truffle you could taste and smell. My friend really enjoyed his burger and was moaning with each bite he took.. . Both of the shakes were sweet, bursting with flavor, and as yummy as they sounded. Definitely order one w/ your meal if you opt to come here.. . The burgers and drinks were really good. Were they worth the hefty price tag? Not really. Especially since everything is nearly nickle-and-dimed if you're not just getting a plain burger and the items on the menu increased in price (i.e. sauces increased by a dime, the Rossini Burger was prior $60 instead of the $65, several of the other burgers increase by $3-4 as well, etc).. . Service was decent. They only dropped off food and refilled our water so nothing to praise or complain.
The food is super delicious and I would visit again. Oreo shake is at least a 20 ounce so sharing is encouraged. Burger Bar will make custom flavors too.. Dining with a friend we ordered 2 burgers and 1 shake. It was late afternoon and a few customers, though the wait to eat was sufficient for fresh made to order food. . . My pet peeve are restroom and although this one was clean, the faucet water sprays out and nearly drenched my shirt and the floor. I commented on this to the manager and his response was"Yes, I am aware but the company has not authorized anyone to come out and fix it." Poor customer service in that respect. . I always think towards the comfortability and ease of things dining in a restaurant or using the restroom. My ultimate goal is to exit the establishment feeling good to come back and feel safe leaving. The restroom issue is a safety hazard because of the water on the floor, but all the same it would not preclude me from visiting again... for food. Thus the reason for the four star review.

Always my first stop in vegas. I chosecto stay in Luxor just for its proximity to burger bar.
This is a place I go to every time I go to Vegas. The burgers are fantastic and so are the selection of beers. I switch between building my own and the Hubert Keller Burger (substituting the Buffalo for Kobe). The side sauce sampler is a good choice if you want variety. Of the sauces, I would strongly recommend the truffle mayo.
My turkey burger was soooooo good and the beer we had was just as good. You have to try the samichlaus classic. The jalapeno fries are to die for too
Great burgers!
I really liked the Burger Bar.  This was my first experience and I will definitely love to go back.  I am extremely picky about my burgers.  The worst thing for me is to get a burger with cheap meat or gristle.  I did not have this problem at Burger Bar.  . . There are many options to choose from on the menu.  There are specialty burgers already designed or you can make your own.  You can choose your bread, kind of burger, toppings and condiments.  I chose an angus burger on ciabatta roll with sauteed mushrooms and caramelized onions.  It was delicious!  We also shared the fries and they were good too.  My daughter had a mint chocolate chip shake and that was yummy too.  . . The only downfall to the Burger Bar is that it is pricey.  I guess that what you can expect in Vegas now so it's no surprise.  The service was good but a little rushed.  All in all, I would definitely come back.  I'd love to try the Kobe burger next time; I just need to wrap my head around a $17 burger!
Great food as always! Build your own burger with your favorite toppings, get a sampler of dipping sauces and try the jalapeno onion petals! Must stop here everything we're in Vegas.. . We have gotten our who family hooked on this place. We go here every time we are in Vegas.
