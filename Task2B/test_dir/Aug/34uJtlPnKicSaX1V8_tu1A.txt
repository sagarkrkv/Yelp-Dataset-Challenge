The Venetian is very similar to every other hotel in Vegas. But I am a big fan of the second floor where the ceiling is painted like the sky, and it feels just like walking in Venice. Sometimes if you hangout there long enough you might even catch a thunderstorm. . . But yeah, if you're looking for over the top shopping and a casino with restaurants, bars, and clubs you can of course find all of those things too.
Five star hotel all the way around.  Great service no complaints. I stay here every time I'm this way.
This review is for Tao Beach. I was very excited to try a beach party. It was going to be a hundred and three in Las Vegas anyway why stay in? So we decided on the towel day pool party and it was quite an interesting event.. . We arrived there around 330 in the afternoon and the party had already started without us! We entered pain about $20 per person. However, after entering we realized that we wanted to have a daybed. We went back up and changed our request and that change cost us $300! I must admit that we ran into some difficulty based on the fact that originally the hostess said that tax and gratuity was included in the price. We later found out that that was incorrect. After further discussion with management they were very gracious enough to accommodate what the original hostess quoted us. They adjusted our bill accordingly. Iwas very satisfied with this action especially noting that one of our hostess was very very rude.. . I enjoyed my time at the beach party the music was great the people were nice and everybody just seemed on the up and up! We ordered sweet potato french fries chicken wing lollipops and shrimp wraps. Everything was so tasty but after two pictures of tea and vodka, it made it hard for us to eat all of our meal. And keep our sexy going! Overall I enjoyed my time and I would definitely suggest that you go to Tao Beach Club at least once. It's great with a few friends if you don't mind shelling out some extra money.
Have stayed here multiple times and always enjoy the rooms.  Every room has sunken living area, very nice bathrooms, and multiple televisions.  For the price, really enjoyed the hotel.
I love staying here. You can fit 30 people in 1 suite which makes that $10 a night. FTW!
Hands down the nicest hotel on the strip. OMG it's so nice. That's all I can say. They have gondoliers like Venice and the sky is breathtaking inside. Yea, it's all inside. Your life will never be the same after staying here. The only reason I'd consider giving it 4 stars is because it's too nice and now i dont want to stay anywhere else.
Je suis partie en weekend a Venise fin 2009, et j'ai eu la chance d'y remettre les pieds en 2010, mais par procuration, en etant a Vegas! Et oui, ici, on y est sur la place Saint Marc. On voit les gondoles, et meme les pigeons sont la pour planer au-dessus de nous.. . Le plus bel hotel de Vegas pour moi. Il a vraiment su retranscrire l'esprit de cette magnifique ville de Venetie. On retrouve le Campanile, qui s'impose fierement sur le strip, sans rien envier a la fake Tour Eiffel de l'autre cote. Les gondoles telles qu'on les trouve le long du Long Canal sont egalement la pour faire le show. . . Vous etiez en plein Vegas en pleine nuit? Vous vous retrouvez en plein Venise en plein jour? C'est NORMAL! C'est ca aussi Vegas! Grace au faux ciel peint dans l'enceinte de l'hotel, vous ne savez plus quel jour ni quelle heure il est! Le petit glacier est la, les petits cafes aussi, les restaurants egalement. . . Une imitation du palais des doges, des peintures au plafond...Bref, l'Italie retranscrite dans plusieurs milliers de metres carres pour le plaisir des yeux.
One of my favorite Hotels in Vegas. . . The rooms are awesome. Always clean and the decor is really nice. I love the Italian theme. . . The casino is on the high end. . . Has a ton of shopping and eating spots here.. . Tao is an awesome club. I love the music they play here.. . Great place to stay.
This is my second time staying at the Venetian and I have to say that both times have been an excellent experience. Both times I have stayed in the Bella Suites. I have stayed at Cesar's Palace and the Venetian suites are a lot more affordable, spacious, and they are just beautiful.  I did read some of the yelp reviews which many complained about the renovation. Once I arrived I requested a room away from the renovation and they gave me a renovated room!  I did not even notice the renovation that was going on. All the staff are very polite and helpful. I will definitely be returning. They have free WIFI, which is not the best, however it gets the job done.  Cesar's Palace only allows 2 devices to be used.
What's not to love about the venetian, every time we visit we are always treated with respect by all the staff, our room was just the way I wanted it. I requested rose pedals and champagne in my room and as no surprise everything was perfect. The casino have been real cool with giving us comps so that's a plus.
The palace is a little dirty it looks like it has  mold... People are bound to get sick if it's mold... Do not know of it is but sure it looks like it
The room was large and luxurious but I would rate it low due to the following reasons:. They force you to pay a resort fee which is only disclosed after you book and provide your cc on their website. You cannot not pay even if you don't use the services offered.. Secondly this place is not kid friendly at all, to get to the room one has to walk the whole    building. Also due to the free alcohol offered there are very rowdy people all around, we found a few on the elevator, that were using very filthy language and talking inappropriately for a public place.
Very nice rooms, really old school. This place really makes you feel like royalty.
The Venetian is my go to hotel for my Vegas escapes. Though absolutely gigantic, the Venetian offers seamless and quick check in services. Every time I've visited I have been greeted by a friendly employee excited about my stay. The rooms are spectacular. Easily one of the largest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in, the rooms offer two queen beds, night stands, a sunken living room with a sofa bed, a couple of televisions, and a fully stocked fridge. Their bathrooms are amazing too, with a deep tub and a separate glass shower enclosure. I love how the toilet is in it's separate room offering both privacy and smell containment! . . The resort offers many different features. There's plenty of pools, a handful of restaurants, and a complete shopping experience. The architecture is opulent and magnificent. . . Check out can be time consuming as they seem to have less employees manning the counter, but a small concession for a brilliant stay.
VERY DISAPPOINTED - Poor Customer Service!!!!!  My husband booked a wonderful birthday weekend getaway in a Bella Suite at The Palazzo Hotel but when we arrived all they had left to give us was a handicap accessible room or a smoking room. We had no choice but to take the accessible room as we are not smokers & can't take the cigarette smoke. They promised us a room change the next day which took 5 - 6 hours and they didn't honor their promise to call us when the new room was ready. On the last night my husband requested a late check out @ either 12 or 1:00 and @ first they said ok but then phoned us right back & said sorry but they had a VIP coming in the next day & they needed that exact room (non-strip view) & we must be out by 11:00 am. They didn't honor the birthday invitation offers at all either that came w/ our reservation deal. Having to use a handicap room while battling my Lyme Disease, unpack & repack to move the next day. Really poor customer service overall yet we are Club Grazie members.  Will seriously re-think about booking with Palazzo or Venetian and most likely find another more honorable customer service oriented establishment.
Arrived at 11am and our room reservation could not be found using our conformation code. Waited to determine the issue and continued to wait amongst others while people passed by. They eventually switched us to palazzo when we were originally booked at the Venetian. Once we were at palazzo some of our room keys didn't work this happened not once not twice but three times. Walking back and forth from the hotel room back to the lobby..... I was even more unhappy because the palazzo is more of a walk to the center of the strip. I enjoy staying in Vegas throughout my summer vacation, but I will not ever bestaying at Venetian/Palazzo or do I recommend my friends to book their rooms here. I prefer Cosmo or Caesars. At least they don't lose my reservation.. Or do I have to wait an hour just to check into my room.
My rating of this place went downhill with each subsequent night. We stayed 5 nights total. The good: The lobby and grounds are beautiful. The room and bathroom are spacious. The air conditioning works really well.. . I started with a 4 or 5-star first impression, despite the long, Disneyland type winding line to check in and the sales job to then get you to pay more for a room with a view. Got to our room and we were wowed by the spaciousness, complete with sunken living room. TVs in the living room, bedroom, and bathroom. Wow. Huge marble bathroom.. . Then you notice the 1970s couch that looked disheveled enough that I never wanted to sit on it for fear of what stains I'd be connecting with. Then night falls and you turn on all the lights.Every. last. one. And yet you still can't see. Then you wait, thinking they must be the type that slowly warm up and get brighter. It was literally still dark in the toilet area when you turned the light on. I could never see my face well enough to put on make-up easily. And the lighted make-up mirror never worked, despite us leaving a note every single day.. . They had a mini fridge, but it was fully stocked and you paid even if you just picked something up and didn't use it. The charge went through based on the shifting weight. This meant we couldn't put our own water, food, or drinks in the fridge. I hated that.. . I am not a fan of only flat sheets on beds. I like fitted sheets over the mattress so you don't risk having the mattress pad exposed and your body touching it or the mattress. This was the case here. It grossed me out. . . Then fast-forward to our last day, and housekeeping never came to our room. We got back around midnight and needed to pack and shower, and we could do nothing until they came to make the beds and replace the towels. They put us on a list and said they'd try to be there in 20 minutes. WHAT?? 45 minutes later, they had made up and refreshed our linens. Even after talking to a manager twice, NOTHING was done to expedite the service and nothing was taken off our exorbitant final bill.. . The clock radio never worked. And a weird, thick layer of dust covered it and my iPhone every single morning. Gross.. . So my impression of this place went downhill night after night. I won't be a return customer.
Just a heads up as the Venetian is remodeling a lot of their rooms and they are not taking good care of their guests in the process. Our stay was on the 23rd floor from 8/22 thru 8/29. To give you an idea how bad it was - on our last morning we were shocked to hear hammering above us at 6:15AM. It took a couple phone calls from the room to get a live person who said they would take care of it immediately. 45 minutes later the hammering stopped but then we were serenated with sounds of a carpet kicker and screws falling on to hard floors. We are very disappointed at the front desk upon check out and I even took the extra time after our return to send an email to the Venetian to see if they would do anything after-the-fact. Sorry to say there has been no attempt and after 4 stays at the Venetian this will clearly be our last. The Wynn and the Bellagio know how to treat their guests and go to extreme efforts to make sure THEIR guests want to come back. We're disappointed more than upset and perhaps others that will read this who had similar experiences will share their stories too. Only in the hopes that the Venetian will step up to be a true 4 or 5 Star Hotel. The single star above represents their current level of guest treatment.. . Going back to Vegas in November for a week but not to the Venetian!
This is a review for the casino. We stayed at the Palazzo (which was nice).. . We had some time to kill on the morning of our flight, so we decided to try the tables at Venetian. Dealers were average, and we quickly realized the blackjack payouts were 6-5, instead of the standard 3-2. This is a fairly significant difference, and unacceptable imo. Playing $10/hand? You get $12 for a blackjack instead of $15. Playing $50/hand? You get $60 instead of $75. . . Never again.
Beautiful hotel and very accommodating. The suites are spacious and staff was friendly. Will consider staying again.
Always a great time to be had at the Venetian. The rooms have a sunken living room, 3  flat screens (1 of them in the bathroom), a jet tub, amazing views, and a most luxurious bed. So luxurious, we are considering ordering one for the house. The room service was very quick and friendly with any request that we had. . . The room safe came quite in handy as I had brought some very expensive jewels in anticipation for the Mark Twain show at UNLV. Not to be missed are the walks around the casino (the architecture is amazing), and the gondola ride (make reservations).
Stayed here while attending a Conference. The room was really nice! Every hotel room is a suite. What I like most about rhe Venetian is the convenience. Located in the heart of the vegas strip. Walgreens is downstairs in case is anything. The cannals shopping area is walking distance. Lots of restaurants and stores.
Nice hotel with European/ romantic theme.couples friendly. great casino floor layout. A little tough too get on the strip. The club is fun with good music . Ho
This hotel was far from a five star rating. I stayed there with my wife and kids, my kids are young adults and we had three rooms for four nights. The rooms were terrible! Bleached, stained worn out furniture, rooms not cleaned or inspected. Our room had drug bags under the front of the sofa and on the sofa cushion (see photos attached). When these things were brought to the front  desks attention they were rude and stated that the hotel was full and there was nothing they could do to move us. . . I stay in many many hotels in Vegas and was shocked by the Venetian. We will NEVER recommend it to anyone or stay here again.
1973 reviews already; so I don't have much to add.. . I will just say this...I love the Venetian!  . . As a matter of fact, it's one of the only places I will stay in Vegas going forward.  The others being (The Palazzo, The Wynn and the Encore.). . That about covers it...great service, great environment...pools, restaurants...I could go on, but it's not necessary.   If you can swing it; stay here!
Vegas has some nice hotels on the Strip but the Venetian is my favorite among them all! Fiance and I stayed at this beautiful hotel for a week and we have zero complaints about the entire experience. The hotel itself is Italian themed and the attention to detail in the decor is just gorgeous! I love the shopping area with the gondolas. Our suite was spacious, comfortable and well-maintained. The service here is excellent. I love how this hotel is so big that you never really have to step outside. They are several excellent restaurants and shops located right inside the hotel. They even have Walgreens! Choose this hotel if you are staying in Vegas! :)
omg i looooooooooooovvvvve this hotel, so many shops and so many food choices!!!!!!! and i really really really love the gondola rides, the person controlling it is like: "yo ima italian bitch! lemme sing u a song. and the suites is like: yo, i have three flat screened televisions and a couch and comfy beds and a desk that makes u look like a boss mofo!!!! you could also control ma curtains with a remote control. and his mom is like: im the biggest hotel eveaaaaaaaaa! and i im just stalling untill this is longer then most reviews, do it now now now now now now now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...whoa...what did i just smoke...i wonder where my kids are......................................................................why am i waiting?....................................................
A vast hotel complex in the centre of the Vegas strip - more of a small town than a hotel . Had great service throughout my stay, although check-in at 4pm was very busy and took a while. The room was excellent (an entry level suite with a view of the strip) in the piazzo part of the hotel. The pool was good with helpful staff. The Tao club/pool was funny for people watching. The conference facilities were good and well serviced. The amount of Restaraunts and shops was crazy - hundreds of all price and type. Pricey, but a very good standard of hotel with easy access to all the major Vegas sights.
I recently stayed here with a few of my friends and we were extremely disappointed with the customer service. Two of my friends are currently breast feeding and needed to pump when we arrived at the hotel after a long drive. Our suite was not ready when we checked in so we politely asked if there was a private room where our two friends could pump. The lady at check-in was so rude and said they could go into the bathroom to do that. My friends were directed to a private bathroom and had to pump in there. There was no chair/couch in there, so the two options were stand or sit on the toilet. Absolutely appalling. Obviously we were furious with this so we asked to speak with a manager. Ironically, the manager was pregnant, however she didn't seem too empathetic with our situation. She offered us a late check-out for our troubles. That was nice, but the whole situation was very upsetting. For a nice hotel like the Venetian we expected much better service. This was my last stay at the Venetian. We will most definitely use a different hotel for future Vegas trips.
I love this hotel!!!. . My husband and I have decided this is our hotel of choice when visiting Las Vegas. . . The lobby was beautiful. Dining excellent and staff top rated. . . We enjoyed our suite and great view. Upon entry, we were overwhelmed with the beautiful decor, the three flat screens, bar, bathrooms, double entry doors to the bedroom, the jet tubs, double sinks and showers and our spectacular view of the strip.. . We enjoyed room service every morning and the staff was fantastic!!!. . Would recommend this hotel to anyone.
I don't have much more to add to what's already been positively described: we got our room earlier than expected; enjoyed a very romantic gondola ride for my birthday; the V bar was a live hookah bar that night; in-room dining was fast and tasty; concierge was very accommodating and friendly at check-in and check-out. No complaints. I'll definitely be back.
We were in town for a bachelor party that I was hosting and called the Piazza and attached Luxury Suite as home base for the weekend (Fri- Monday). We had 7 people stay and we had plenty of room. We were on the top floor (28th) of a newly renovated floor and the furnishings and beds were comfortable. Room was quiet and clean. Large formal dining table which would have been good to play poker.. . I reserved the room about 1 month ago to take advantage of a birthday special. I told the phone agent that b/c of the large group of 12 in the bachelor party and we had people departing at various times- we would probably downsize to 1 suite only on Sunday. I was told that since we had a special rate that it was more advantageous to keep the existing 3 nights and then, decide on Sun morning which room we would not need. Otherwise, we would get a much higher rate if we decided to add a nite. Since there was no charge, it was a no brainer.. . . Sunday 12:15p. Tried to checkout on the tv, but it was after 12:00 so 'not available'. Tried calling the front desk from the room, but placed on long hold since many others trying to check out. Moved all of our stuff into the smaller Luxury Suite.. . . Had to get over to our table at Encore Beach so I used my cell phone to call front desk enroute to Encore. After 3 unsuccessful attempts- long hold times and after getting connected, got disconnected- I finally got thru to someone. This time the phone agent stayed on the line until the front desk answered (that was appreciated since I had gotten cut off previously). They said no problem and that I was checked out of the Piazza Suite. I went back around 5p to turn in the old keys and get correct keys for the smaller luxury suite.. . Went up to the room and there was a sign on the Luxury Suite- Room maintenance in progress. Curiously, once inside, the adjoining room doors were still open on both sides. I closed up the one on our Luxury suite side and deadbolted it before we left to go out. When we returned, again both adding doors were open. There was no one new who checked into the Piazaa suite- the 2 roll-a-beds were still there and no luggage.. . Went out again and when we returned around 3AM, the adjoining doors on both sides were open again. I don't know how that could be unless someone came inside our room and opened it again. Couldn't figure that one out..  . . Anyways, we were having an enjoyable experience until time to check out on Monday. I wanted a physical print out of the totals for both rooms so that it would make my accounting easier for the shared expenses. Went to hotel front desk and got the Luxury Suite receipt for the 3 nights without issue.. . When they were reviewing the Piazza suite bill, they incorrectly charged the entire 3 nights. I was not given an invoice. I told her that was incorrect and the agent went to talk to her manager (Sang). She came back to tell us that it was correctly billed since they have no record of me asking to check out early on the Piazza suite. She asked me who I spoke to on the phone. After being transferred around and disconnected, how am I suppose to know who I spoke to?. . A multi-national LV Sands corporation doesn't have a billing reservation system that logs all calls and identifying the employee ID? I find that very hard to believe.. . She asked if I wanted to speak to the manager and (even though my cousin was waiting in front), I did. He came out- and was not very apologetic. He essentially said that the charges are going to stay on my credit card and he will conduct an investigation. He also asked me who I spoke to on the phone (seriously, you're a billion $ corporation and you can't figure that out?!). The manager stated that he would ask for the security key lock log of the Piazza suite and if we did not indeed access the suite after our late 3p checkout Sunday (I already swapped keys so how could we have entered?), he would refund the charges then; otherwise, they stay on. He also had no answer for why our attached suite door had been opened again when we returned.. . My brother and I both queried him on this and I suggested a fairer way would be to immediately reverse the charges, make them pending (like credit card companies do) and then conduct their investigation (we didn't have the keys). Basically, he implied that they don't trust us on our word and that if they can prove that it was their error, then they would correct it. For the small amount of $ they were trying to "get", they just cost them a lot of potential future business from not just me, but also, those who find this useful on how they value your business.. . Now, I'm glad that I didn't gamble there.. . This action on his part has left a very bad taste in my mouth with their hotel management. (esp when they dropped the ball).. . $300 for all this negative perception and ill will. Poor form, Venetian, poor form.. . [As a followup, the manager did call in the later afternoon stating that the charges were being refunded]
