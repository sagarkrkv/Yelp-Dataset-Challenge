Stipulation: I went here for a private party, but I am unsure of the totals costs of entrance and the long wait. . . The inside of Pure looks and feels like a typical Las Vegas chic nightclub. Small dancefloor, cool couches, attractive service staff etc. I would recommend going to the rooftop bar for a great scenic view of Vegas. Prices were what you would expect too. Nothing too outrageous from what I remember.
