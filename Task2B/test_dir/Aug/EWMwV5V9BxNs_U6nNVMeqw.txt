Get the Fez Burger! That is all I can say. I dream about it.
We ordered the chicken strip that were very good and had a light batter. It had a great spicy aioli. The balsamic blue burger was a great choice, I ordered it with sweet potatoes rather then the salad it comes with.
Good atmosphere. Excellent fare. Generous portions and incredibly well prepared and fresh.
I love Fez.. the food is fantastic, service is amazing, and the atmosphere is basically perfect.  Eat here... do it...
Great brunch, great burgers, and one of the best desserts in town(fez gooey brownie).
Came here after i saw them listed on a top 10 burger list on AZCentral.  I had recently had a disappointing burger experience at The Chuck Box in Tempe the previous week so i was looking for something to hopefully get me out of my burger time blues.  Let me say I was not disappointed.  . . I went with two other work buddies and we all ended up ordering the Fez Burger all with different kinds of fries.  The combo of everything on that burger was sublime.  the cinnamon pears gave it the perfect addition of some sweetness mixed with the BBQ sauce and the Feta.  The cibatta bread was excellent too.  not too hard and not too soggy.  I ordered the sweet potato fries which had a great cinnamon sugar coating and mixed with whatever awesomeness they included as a dipping sauce was the perfect combo. The server was extremely friendly and we were able to get seated right away during the lunch time rush.  I'm deducting a star for my burger not coming out medium rare, didn't affect the flavor but still a tick mark off of a good burger list.  I will be back for sure to try out some other dishes that looked great as well.
This is a trendy restaurant with a somewhat slightly Middle Eastern menu (as the name implies) although the ambiance is more yuppie/lunchtime business crowd than Middle Eastern (we have traveled in the Middle East). The music, which is loud, is popular music without the heavy stuff. I ate there twice, once with a group and the second time with my wife. The food is good with large portions and the service is okay. The egg dishes for breakfast were excellent.  It's very loud there, the acoustics make it difficult to have a conversation, so I'd advise avoiding the crowded times when going there if possible.
Pesto Caesar salad. It's the bomb!!
Finally trying this place out for a quite girls night out. First, I was a little bit skeptical on the ravin' reviews - how good could it be? A friendly gentleman sat us down and our wonderful waitress was giving us spot on recommendations. I love great service! First bite on the appetizer - WOW - I think i just had da best garlicky hummus in town! The bread that came with it was soo delicious, it wasn't your typical pita bread, it was super moist and tasted fresh from the oven! The half portion strawberry salad (pictured) was great and filling as well, the added chicken slices were a tad too salty for my taste (maybe a better fit on a starch than on a salad). The portions here is huge (they can feed up to two people per their menu description) so make sure you come in hungry! We also had that days drink special - orange martini for $8 - don't let the pretty color fool you because that drink was strong! Will definitely be coming back to try other food from their menu, and, oh, they have hh and reversed hh everyday :)
I came in and sat at the bar for lunch. Service took a while. Once I had the full attention of the bartender, he was fantastic! He made great suggestions and the food was terrific if a bit pricey. It took a long time after I was finished to cash out.  Length of time waiting is the only reason I gave 3 stars.
Great place, great food. Waitresses and/or Bartender could be a little more attentive.
I used to like this place very much . but i think the quality of food is not as good anymore..the fries were too salty. the meat was too oily and made the bread saggy and my friend ordered a pasta which the chicken was cold...im kinda bumped that one of my favorite places to eat and the food wasn't good for the past couple of times that i hve been there. the atmosphere is great. . i even asked them could you make sure that the burger is not dripping oil..ohh well..
Turned me on to Sweet Potato Fries!! SOOOO good
