I'm trying to keep in mind this is one of the oldest hotels in Vegas. That being said, I'm just not impressed with our room, the actual hotel. The pool is by the nicest spot in the hotel. . . Bring your money! This is just as pricy as any where else in the strip
This was our first time in las Vegas and my friend and I decided to get rooms at Flamingo for the "Vegas " experience. Loved it here, the rooms are clean, nice view, staff super friendly. Oh, and the pool! It's massive!
Service was terrible, took 4 phone calls and a trip to the front desk to get towels. 2 out of 12 elevators were working. 0 out of 12 were working on the last day. Took stairs into a construction site with all our bags. Parking lot was full. Don't stay here.
Flamingo Las Vegas fits nicely into the overall scene on The Strip.  Of course it has been VEGAS forever and there are a lot of vintage photos in and around the hotel to remind you of its roots..      The accomodations are a-ok and what I expected.  5-star?  No.  4-star?  It begins to touch the basement of a 4-star.  My personal opinion is Flamingo is a satisfactory 3 to 3.5-star stay.  The pool is just adequate.  The casino is large and has some "Whale Areas" for the high-rollers.  I didn't view Flamingo as a true Vegas-style nightlife stop as is Caesars or Bellagio or Arias and the likes..      Flamingo gets it done with common fanfare, good food and buffet offerings.  The room are basic in my range of stays.  I wish it has a 24-hour food shop in which to quench the thirst or grab a snack or something hot..     Location?  It's perfect.  You can stay for less at the Flamingo - not be disappointed - and have access to all that is diamonds, gold, platinum and the likes to your north, south,east and west.
I'm never staying here again! Horrible! Rooms smell, not enough elevators for the amount of people staying here.. . Old, dirty, just not the type of Vegas I'm used to! Some times saving money isn't worth it!
My boyfriend and I just stayed here, I paid for a "remodeled" fab deluxe room and there was nothing fab about it. The bathroom wasn't remodeled, there was mildew in the tub and the shower was luke-warm at best. The carpet in the hallways was stained and rippled. The electricity was out for several hours and we had to walk down 24 flights of stairs to get out of the hotel with constant fire alarms ringing. There was room service trash sitting in the hallway for two days. At the pool we waited an hour and a half before they would let us in the pool (because of the power outage), and we couldn't get any service for food, despite asking someone several times for a food menu. We also gambled for several hours at the electronic craps table without any drink service. When we checked out, I requested to speak to a manager, who didn't even bother to come and apologize for the terrible experience, but instead just offered a credit of the resort fees, which doesn't even come close to comping the terrible experience we had. Next time we will spend more money to stay at a hotel that actually cares about their guests' experiences because it's clear that at the Flamingo the customer does not come first.
Awful, will never spend a dime here ever again. Horrible customer service.
Where do I start?   . . Did a fairly good job with the new rooms but lipstick on a pig. Bathrooms still suck. My room simply could not get cool. . . I had to get new room keys on 4 occasions because mine stopped working. The cell phone and magnetic money clip excuse works once, but when I'm keeping it in my back pocket and it continues to happen?  I spoke with scores of other people with similar issues. . . Food:  in room dining is an hour plus wait every time you call. . . Dining options?  How about margaritaville and Carlos n Charlie's?  Wait, are we in Mexico?  These places are cliche and I impressive. . . Carlos and Charlie's.  Their famous Queso. You know what it is?  Freaking nacho cheese sauce out of a can. Same you'll get on your ballpark nachos. Queso my ass. . . There is a nice steak house called Center Cut. It doesn't seem to fit with the white trash tourist model they've gone with. . . Given the other eateries here, I skipped it for another nearby steakhouse (Ruth's Chris) with a known reputation and actually lower prices. . . We stayed here because it's a Total Rewards property and I pressure my friend into it for that reason and used the fabulous pool as justification. The pool was nice, especially if you love to people watch. Douchebags galore, but a good time nonetheless. . . My last night here, tonight, is the first of four where my floor didn't absolutely wreak of marijuana. . . Service was sub par throughout the venu. . . If you book, except a solid 20 minute minimum wait to check in. . . If you need new keys, there's a separate line for that, thank goodness, however the first three times in thatline it was 20 minutes just for new keys. The last time there was no wait at all. . . Resort fees. I don't mind paying them, but the hypocrisy of running nearly 4 year promo campaign denouncing them, only to reverse said policy, is irritating at best. . . The pimping out of Carlos n Charlie's as a night club, by seedy type characters feels like they've brought the street promoters inside the property and lowers the atmosphere to the same level as the strip club promoters on the streets. . . Dining options were by far the most disappointing. . . I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 because it is what it is and I knew that coming in, but it failed to meet my even tempered expectations. . . If you're the type of person who thinks red lobster is a high class seafood restaurant, and eats at places like Carlos n Charlie's, senor frogs, or hard rock, when on vacation you'll enjoy this place. . . If you're looking for a nice hotel with any semblance of class and comfort, look elsewhere. . . Also, they will require a 200 dollar deposit upon check in to cover any room charges. I gave them cash because if you use a credit card you won't see it back for 8 to 10 days after checkout. . . This is a pain in the ass because the line to check out tomorrow will be a solid 30 minutes and I'm dreading that. . . This did give me 65 dollars in free play, but I had to go from total rewards to the cashier and back. Then was given an 800 number. 20 minutes in I got cut off with non call back. The next call got the job done, however then there was a problem getting it at the total rewards counter. The young lady there was great, and manually wrote one out for me. Shouldn't be that difficult, but I did appreciate that they got it sorted. . . Also, my toilet is jacked. Sometimes won't stop running. I took the lid off to fix and it sprayed water all in my face and made a huge mess. I got video of fixing it the next time, face out of the way of course. . . I will always recommend staying at a Total Rewards property. But I won't stay at the flamingo again unless they make some pretty massive changes. . . I also forgot to state that they tried charging me 35 dollars for early check in even though there were no rooms available and there would not be until at least noon (3 hours later). They said I could pre check in, and then come back for keys later at no cost. I asked how that's different than the 35 dollar early check in when no rooms are available. The desk clerk said there was really no difference. They just have to offer and try and push it. Soooo, we try and get 35 more dollars out of you for nothing. How shady and unethical is that!
Let me start this off by saying, we loved the Flamingo and now we hate the Flamingo. We, my husband and I, have been going to the Flamingo a couple times each year since spending our honeymoon there. I'd say we've stayed at the Flamingo a total of 10 times in both the GO Room and in their Fab rooms. We loved the rooms, the staff, the cleaniness, the casino. We even overlooked the elevators and the hallways which we knew would eventually be renovated (by the way, they haven't touched the elevators or the hallways in the last 6 years and they looked crappy and smelled even back then). Our last trip has changed us forever. . . Since our last visit, The Linq and the great big wheel of death (aka The High Roller) has opened. You'd think this wouldn't affect the parking situation or the employees of the Flamingo. WRONG! We drove about 6 hours to get to the Flamingo, when we arrived it was late - about midnight. We drove up, like we always had, to valet our car - so it would be easier to get our luggage upstairs and to the lobby. Nope. Valet was jammed full and ONLY open to Seven Star platinum and up members. This is new. So, plan #2 was to park in the parking structure next to the hotel. We've done this before and the walk isn't bad. Too bad there's no parking spaces! Valet took about 1/2 the structure (and 1/2 of those spaces were empty so who knows WTF valet was doing with a full valet area in front of the lobby!) and there's about an entire floor dedicated to rental cars (again, only about 1/2 full). So, driving up and down the parking structure - twice! We gave up and decided to check out where the overflow parking was. In the back FAR, FAR, FAR away from the hotel and practically full! I don't know WTF they were thinking when they built The Linq and The High Roller but they obviously didn't think about people wanting to visit the thing and how it was going to impact paying customers of their hotel. Furious at this point, I just had my husband drop me off at the valet area with all of our luggage so he could park 2 miles away. I went inside the valet drop-off area and found that the escalator going up was out. Got into the elevator. Broke. Tried to ask a valet person on how to get upstairs without taking the actual stairs (my back was sore and I could no way carry my luggage up myself), the 1st and 2nd valet person ignored me. The 3rd valet person finally told me to go to the other entrance and waved his hand in some direction. I went back outside and guessed my way to the other entrance, which was to the right. At this point I'm not only furious but on the edge of tears. Oh, and it's about 2am by now. So with my back aching now, I walk over to the other entrance IN THE STREET BECAUSE THERE IS NO SIDEWALK with cabs honking at me while they're trying to get to this other entrance also, I go inside and guess what? The escalator going up is broke. I find the elevator, which is a winding walk in corridors and doesn't feel like it's for public access. When I finally get to the lobby, my husband shows up and he's now furious because of all the crap I've had to go through to just get to this point - which I'm in a line to get my keys because I had already checked into the room online. When I'm finally at the check-in desk the employee asks about my night - I unleash my story. She's not very sympathetic (which tells me alot of other hotel guests have gone through this same thing which makes it an issue that NO ONE is dealing with!!!!!), offers me a $30 food & beverage credit which I take just so I can get my key and go to my room. No upgrade. No apology. Nothing other than a F&B credit. So, we get to our room and it just doesn't feel clean. We try to call about changing rooms but we couldn't even get the front desk. The Flamingo had us beat. . . The final kicker came when we got the bill at check-out. Their resort fee covers only 1 device on wifi. Both my husband and I agreed to the T&Cs on our phones to use their wifi. It was faster than our cell service. Sure, you can say this was our mistake but I feel their policy for only 1 device is unbelievable!. . During our stay, we decided that the Flamingo had let us down and we were never staying there again. I'm not even sure if we'd stay at another Harrah's property again. We were previous MGM properties people and changed over to Harrah's properties back when they didn't have resort fees. Now that all Harrah's hotels have resort fees, not to mention some of the highest on the strip, and due to the service we received during our last visit, we are gladly returning to being MGM property people.. .  Good bye Flamingo! Way to let us down!
We decided to try our old haunt, the Flamingo, after switching over to MGM Resorts for the last 4 years, thinking it couldnt be THAT bad.  Wrong. . . We got comped 3 nights and low rates fri/sat (MGM wasnt so accomodating, the reason for the switch). . So FIRST update is there is the new annoying resort fee, despite their advertising rhetoric the last several years about 'no resort fee'.  Its $23/day (incl tax).Supposed to cover internet - BUT ONLY ONE DEVICE PER ROOM.  (@!%#@!!) Really?  You're supposed to be hip yet dont realize that 2 people are gonna have at least 3 devices?. . After waiting in line to check in for 45 minutes at 11pm on a Weds night, we're informed we couldve gone to the secret unmarked line since we were casino guests.  Pardon me, no sign, say what?  The front desk person was polite, quick professional, but we got stuck in the veritable dungeon - room 5106, which faces a stucco facade with service ladders, piping, and loads of flotsam/trash for our viewing pleasure. It was FABULOUS.  It was so dark we had to turn on the lights in the middle of the day.  "well I guess this is how they treat casino guests, they really arent interested in real gamblers anymore" was my thought.. . Now we have been coming to the Flamingo since it was a Hilton back in the 90's.  We always liked the new pool (yes, I remember the old rectangular pool); Flamingo has made the big pool an adults only pool now (YAY), but they have crowded out a great deal of space for highprice cabanas, day beds and rental lounge chairs.  Leaving far too few chairs where the saving of chairs is an art form, with whole slews of them appearing occupied having been 'saved' by someone draping pool towels over them.  I LIKE the music and live DJ, but cmon, lets send someone around to pick up the trash, the pool was a disaster of empty buckets, beer cans and plastic cups near the end of the day.. . Food - well theres a food court, quite overpriced, so I skipped it.  We learned a long time ago to avoid the Paradise buffet - it continues to set new lows for scary food.  We actually have enjoyed the coffee shop over the years - used to be called Lindys and now the Tropical Breeze, they have decent breakfasts and lunches (watch out for the overpriced drinks tho, just drink water).  I miss the old Flamingo Room!. . Now lets talk about gaming.  Craps, theres little they can jigger with here - 3x4x5x odds, and a fun side bet called the fire bet.  Well dealt, but I got my butt handed to me this trip.. Blackjack - theres not much here.  A few tables, but most were the 6/5 21 (an abomination of 3/2 blackjack).  It was hard to spot where at the table this is announced, sometimes on the felt, sometimes on a cardboard tent, etc.  . The blackjack game I did find was out of 8deck shoe, had surrender (yay), DOA, DAS.  Not bad, once I found it.. Video Poker - Jacks or better sank to new lows - the entire property was 7/5.  Now for the uninitated, thats the payoff on Fullhouse/Flush hands.  The nice thing about video poker is that regulations state that machines mimicking a card game must be truly random 52 card deck.  They wont risk their license rigging this.  So the only thing they can jigger is the paytable.  9/6 JoB is close to an even money game, and is much sought after.  Gradually, casinos have rigged these to 8/6, then 8/5 (which I consider to be my very bottom) and now must Harrahs properties are 7/5 (Caesars, Linq, Harrahs, Flamingo, Cromwells, etc).  If the are stooping this low on machines where they have to honestly announce the payout, just imagine how bad the 'unannounced' slot machines are.. Like many strip casinos, roulette is the hideous Americaon 'double 0' wheel, with terrible house advantage, unlike the european wheel with a single 0 and 'en prison'.. . So we get a '1 star' on the casino rating;  I wont be back here to play.. . And another HUGE irritating change - PARKING.  OMG.  Flamingo has now dedicated almost half of its garage to valet parking.  ANOTHER third is now reserved for the Hilton Grand Vacations next door, which I assume must've lost its garage to make room for the new LINQ breezeway and the High Roller.  So now you're pretty much relegated to parking in the back lot - and this is a VERY long walk, it makes the walk from the MGM garage to that hotel seem short in comparison.. . I will be delighted to see the Flamingo come back to its former glory - until i see the reviews perk up and the negative twitters fall, we wont be back.
The Flamingo was mediocre at best. . . When my friends and I arrived for our GNO trip, check in was a breeze. We headed up to our non smoking room and neither of our key cards were working. . . Some of us stayed back in the hallway, as the others went down to get help. There were many young guys and dolls popping in and out of their rooms, offer I us beer and a good time. . . Luckily, our friends returned not only with working keys, but with working keys to a strip view room closer to the elevator. The only downfall was that it would be in the smoking section. . . So, we headed over to our room, and opened our door to a decent sized room with a TINY bathroom. They need to remodel the bathrooms because they are total shit. Leaky faucets in a tiny space that remind me of a motel. . . We tried to upgrade, but everything was sold out. It was a crazy packed weekend. . . You couldn't smell the smoke from the hallway inside of the room which was a blessing, and the air conditioning was great. Room service was so fast and efficient, we didn't expect our room to be cleaned upon our return.. . At least the curtains were pretty. They made for a nice backdrop for pictures, and were fun to pull open to reveal the view. This hotel seemed to be targeted at female visitors, as much of the decor was pink.. . The pool at the Flamingo was probably the best part of our stay. It was clean, there were plenty of towels, and the people were nice. There are real live flamingos and other birds on the grounds en route to the pool. . . The slide was so much fun. You can relive your earliest days as a child when you slide down the water slide with a bunch of friends.. . There weren't any clubs we wanted to go to at the Flamingo, but we had no fear: the Flamingo is in a prime location, at about the middle of the strip. . . Check out and valet took a little while, as everyone seemed to be leaving at the same time.. . All in all, a good hotel for a group trip-the kind of group trip where you are hardly on your room save for sleeping;)!
I had a great time at the Flamingo. My Go Room rocked. I had a great strip view that even had a view of the bellagio fountain show.  The staff was super helpful, even though the lines to check in were ridiculously long. Also, I left my charger in my room and they mailed it back to me overnight. Thanks Flamingo!
The Rewards program is a must! No waiting in line for check in! You also get great discounts!. . They first room they put me in was a non-smoking Fan Luxury room on the 25th floor and it reeked of smoke. I went to the desk to have my room changed. The desk guy called a manager and I was given a little bit of an upgrade to an executive Fab luxury room on the 28th floor. We now had couch and refrigerator :) The room was very clean and spacious. The bath needs an update but had nice big fluffy bath towels! Wood laminate floor in the main room (much better than carpet).. . The hallway definitely needed new carpet! It rained when were their and the ceilings in the hallway were leaking water. They had garbage cans throughout the hallway catching water. Thank goodness our room stayed dry.. . Being on the 28th floor, the view was to die for! We could see both the Bellagio fountain and the Mirage volcano from the room! . . The pool was awesome! We went to both the Go pool and the family pool. Make sure you get there early to get a good spot! People tend to put their towels on chairs to save their spots and leave. . . They don't have the biggest casino but it was nice. They had nice shops and places to eat. Being center of the strip was amazing! Close to everything!
After our recent stay at the Flamingo, I have to delete a few stars due to the new Drais outdoor nightclub.  We stay for extended periods during our Vegas trips, so we do TRY to sleep.  The constant base beats til 5 a.m. proved to be a little much.  As Diamond members we are given rooms with beautiful views.  But the trade off for the views is too irritating!  So if we chose the Flamingo again we will now have to look at the backside of the Flamingo instead of the views we have spent the money to be comped.  We still love the people and the rooms, but will be moving on to another property!  Not great planning there Cromwell!
My girlfriend and I stayed here over the 4th of July weekend. We had comped rooms which was nice but after checking in I completely understood why. The first issue we came to was parking... There was no valet parking unless you were diamond+ and their close parking lot was full. This was a major bummer as it was about 114 outside and not a pleasant walk from about 5 blocks away where we finally found street parking.. . The hotel room was decent - It was a standard room with one king bed. They had replaced the flooring with a faux wood floor that was some kind of tile. That gave it a clean look. Negative points for no coffee maker or refrigerator.. . The halls in the hotel really needed to be updated. The wallpaper was peeling in places and the carpets were in terrible shape. I guess it didn't matter too much as we just walked these to the elevators and down to get right on the strip or play in the casino.. . The elevators.... Ahhhh! I feel like I almost got stuck in one as it was heading down and took a big lurch mid floors and then started heading up?? As soon as it opened I got the hell off as I didn't want to spend all day trapped in an elevator... Or worse??. . The reason for 2 stars... The casino floor. The flamingo seemed like a great off strip casino floor.. Slightly dated tables but really friendly local dealers and low minimums. The flamingo is actually right at the heart of the strip so this was refreshing and I did quite a bit of gambling here. . . Overall - If you're looking for a budget hotel but want to be in the heart of the strip - The flamingo is the place to be. How much time are you really going to be spending in your room anyways?? :)
I love the pool at the Flamingo.  It's never over crowded and a relaxing atmosphere.   I've stayed here several times and always enjoyed it.  They have great rates and the tram is located right behind it.
Shajuan is the best server here. He's really cool. Hooked us up with free shots. I would highly recommend this place. They have great service!
3 hours at the tables and I got 1 drink. . 1 Damn drink over 3 hours. Hostess hadbad attitude too. You bring me drinky I tip well. 1 weak ass drink does not deserve my 3 hours of play. Mgm properties way better. I normally stay at Ceasars properties. I think I am done with them.
I got a nice deal at this place. I stayed for 3 nights at this place. They have nice outdoor pool area. Only problem is the waiting in the line for hours to checkin.  I know it's very old hotel in LV. But definitely worth what you're paying for this hotel. Busy place.
Was disappointed pretty dirty and outdated bathrooms.  Housekeeping did very minimal when they came basically just replaced towels and called it good.  Then majority of the time they had ONE elevator working that was it ONE!!!! So you wait forever for it to go up and come back!  Also saw a couple breaking into cars in their parking garage no idea how long they were doing it but I got ahold of security immediately and hopefully they caught them (this isn't flamingo's fault) but a warning to keep valuables out of your car no matter where you stay.  Will not stay again here.
Flamingo was my favorite with GO delux rooms, but my goodness their customer service is so terrible I would never go there again! There is a manager by the mane Ron or starts with the letter R, maybe Ramon. Total jerk! You do not believe me please go ahead
Although it's a nice hotel.nice rooms.decent people.nice service..what sucked was the no phone service .I had no service at all..it suck ed they charged for wifi..wtf..also what sacked was the pool was 21 and over..really..I had my kids and they couldn't go in..thanks for the dissappiontment.next time I go to Vegas I'll try another hotel..mediocre hotel..
Me and my husband came here on Saturday to shoot a wedding that was happening at the chapel.  I don't even know where to start, I'm so appalled by this place.  You can't even find the entrance for parking to this place it's so ridiculous, and when you do, if you go to valet, you wait forever, forever like, I applied my powder, bronzer, a little more powder, eyebrows AND eyelashes on in the time it took, and we still sat a bit after I was done.  Upon entering the place it was refreshing to see the cute new interior that included pink striped wall paper.  We made our way up to the lobby, and found our way to the bank of elevators where there were 10-15 people waiting, there were at least 10 elevators so it surprised me that people were waiting.  One of the elevators was out of order, I'm assuming, as it had a wet floor sign in front of it and the door was opened.  When we FINALLY were able to catch an elevator we realized that there was no sensor in the doors that opened it automatically when someone stuck their hand between the doors, that's fuckin dangerous, say I didn't know that and I tried to catch the elevator by slipping in and it totally closed on me and my pregnant ass! When inside the elevator it MOVES a few inches when the doors open to floors, it'll drop a coupleof inches.  Since the elevators take so damn long so many people will pile in uncomfortably and people use their survivor tactics to catch an elevator and get off.  We only had to go to the 5th floor which was great, but guess what, if you don't push the button before you get there, you have to go with everyone all the way up to their floor and then all the way down picking people up until you get to the 5th floor, fuckin ridiculous.  When we got to the 5th floor we got out and looked down at the carpet and it's all lifted up and wrinkled, it's dangerous, someone could trip and fall.  The room wasn't too bad, it was a cute little suite with a very clean bed with white sheets and a comforter, the couches were cute but didn't seem to match the theme of the hotel, as they were striped red, gold, and black.  The carpet in the room, however was't wrinkled like the hallways, which was nice.  . . After getting ready, waiting for an elevator, and making our way through the hotel and outside to the chapel we quickly realized where much of their money was going, and that was to their beautiful chapel.  Everything about their chapel was gorgeous! Everything around their chapel smelled like bird poop and stagnant water. . . Also, did I mention I took the stairs from the 5th floor? As we were running out of light to photograph the wedding party, I led the charge to take the stairs since the elevators were taking so long.  Their stairwell was disgusting, if they aren't going to put money into fixing their elevators or making them more efficient then they should probably use that money for the stairwell and create a stairwell that leads directly to the lobby, because the one we took lead to a door outside of the hotel into the street.  At some point going down an employee opened one of the doors and told us we were at the 3rd story, and that we couldn't go into that door because it was an employee door, or something like that, so we went all the way down to the street.. . Don't come here, stick to one of the bigger hotels on the strip, there are much safer, nicer hotels  who you can find much more easily and who also charge the same rates.
I stayed here with my boyfriend a few months back, and we had the BEST experience here. Check-In was a breeze. We got a complimentary upgrade to a Go Room with a Strip View, and thanks to diligent watching of online sales, got the room for next to nothing. We were conveniently located by the elevators behind the front desk, we had a beautiful center view of the strip, and all the luxuries of a suite. Fridge, surround sound, automatic curtains, led lighting, sound system, newly renovated shower, tv in the mirror,etc. The flamingo is in the perfect location - right in the center of the strip. I can't wait to go back again!
I stayed here this past weekend. My girlfriend wanted to stay here because of all the pink everywhere and the flamingos. I was skeptical but thought we would give it a try. How much time do you really spend in the room though in vegas? . . Upon arrival the hotel was nice, it does have an older feel to it especially compares to the cosmopolitan or Caesars right across the street. But it didn't look dirty or run down. The checkin line was a little slow, there was only 3 people checking in. We did try to check in at 9am though which may have been why. The lady at the front desk told us there were no rooms available but to try and come back at noon because the early check in fee is only $30 from 12-4. The actual check in process was pretty quick. I think the daily fee was $22 a day. Which included 2 people to use the weight room a day, a $20/day room credit that can be used at the hotel bars or restaurants which was nice and we used it everyday.. . We booked the standard room with a king size bed. The room was pretty nice. Dark wood floors. Flat screen tv. Bright pink curtains. The bathroom was not comparable at all. It was old looking and def needed an updating. Our view was of the pool and the back end of the hotel. Not a terrible view but it wasn't the strip view. The bed was pretty comfortable. There's no comforter just sheets with a thin blanket and a pink furry piece of fabric which was probably for decoration. The ac kept the room cool and comfortable. There are small glass cups in the room which hold almost no liquid. What I did was get water cups by the pool which are in clear solo cups and just brought those back to the room. . . We heard that the pool was one of the best free pools on the strip. If you plan on getting a lounge chair you need to get there at 8am when they open. People line up before 8 and the chairs go pretty fast. We brought our own towels but they do supply you with pool towels. The drinks are expensive but what do you expect? A bucket of 5 beers is $35. They also have specialty pink refillable cups that you can get frozen or mixed drinks in. I forget exactly the price but I think they were $26 and the refills $19 but I may be wrong. Your not allowed to bring in your own alcohol but they really didn't search the specialty cups so try if you like. The dj went on around noon which is also when it started to get a decent sized crowd. The dj played a mix of music so it was nice not to hear just one genre. Over the pool was pretty awesome as long as you can get over the prices for drinks. The palm trees, rock grotto and waterfall were very nice to be around. . . Check out is absolutely terrible. 11am is a norm time but the elevators to go down suck. I don't just mean over crowded but over crowded to the point where you have to wait a long time just to get space. We ended up taking a elevator up to the  the top floor and riding that down to the first floor only after it stopped at every floor which was packed with people trying to get down. The stairs are an option but once you hit the first floor you have to do some employee hallway maneuvering to actually get out to the lobby.  . . Taxi stands go by pretty quick. There's also a shuttle that goes to the airport not sure what the price is. Also if you don't want to walk down the strip  use the hotel taxi stands to get a cab. They won't pick you up on the strip curb. Not are they allowed to have more than 5 passengers. And the drivers won't break that rule. We tried several times since we are from chicago and they let you jam 10 people in a 5 person car. They apparantly can lose their license if they have 1 too man people. . . Overall the hotel is nice and location is great. Hope this helps anyone.
If you want to spend your money, half your time and your vacation having a panic attack every time you get on an elevator than this is the place for you!. . There are no words to describe the experience of the elevators at the Flamingo because if you read this you'll think how bad could it be...unfortunately you'd have to have been a guest there to truly understand.. . Valet and Elevators are not capable of the capacity which the hotel warrants.  After a 6.5 hour drive from LA do to accidents the Valet was blocked off and Employee had a sucks to be you attitude, not very helpful with parking alternatives.  Finally after asking he directed us to a difficult to find lot A &B where when we finally found a spot we were accosted by who I think was an employee telling us we could not park there because it was employee parking.  30 minutes later we finally found a spot in self parking. And waiting another 15 minutes to just get keys to our room as part of our party was already checked in.. . Overall staff was not friendly, unapologetic and seemed bothered or slow.. . I have stayed at other Vegas hotels in this price range and have never experienced such issues.
No long stories..... -didn't get non-smoking room as requested. -room DEFINITELY did not look as advertised on-line. -linens with holes. -shower curtain (yes, I said curtain) stained. -elevators were not working. -people were stuck on elevator; needed to be rescued. . Positive was front desk service polite and manager gracious enough to refund cost. We moved to Mandalay after an hour of deciding whether to stay or not.
Both nights I stayed here I was woken up in the morning by extremely loud construction noise. I could not even nap in the afternoon due to this. I told the front desk and all they offered was to switch my room. I switched and was still woken up by the sound of jack hammering at 9:30am. The staff either acted as if they couldn't believe it was that loud or like "well it happens." Their website or the staff did not feel it important to inform their guests of the construction at any time until there was a complaint. In my opinion this is terrible business practice. Their guests take time and money out to stay at this hotel and depending on your luck you get stuck under construction with no explanation. . . The hotel did not offer me anything, a room comp, a room upgrade, not even a meal comp. I feel sorry for the people staying here for the upcoming convention who probably are paying double what I did. . . Should I mention I was left w/o a bath mat and Do Not Disturb sign in both rooms. . . Terrible stay.
The Flamingo: it's a fine place to crash. I stayed here in August on my first trip to Vegas, and I'd stay again. Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly.. . THE GOOD: Great location (middle of the Strip across from Caesar's), excellent pools. The GO Pool, the one for adults, is everything you'd want a fun party pool to be, and they have nice thick towels that are unusually luxe for pool towel service. The rooms are cute enough, distinctive in style-- they don't look like a Motel 6. The room and bathroom were clean, and I liked that the duvet cover was washable and gave the impression of being very clean. I loathe hotel bedspreads, so that was a plus. I was on the fourth floor and my room was very quiet over both nights, EXCEPT for the moment when a man ran around the floor at 3 AM screaming like he was being chased by demons. That woke me up. But what do you want? It's Vegas.. . THE BAD: Ants in my room-- seriously. C'mon, guys. I was flicking them off everything I left on the table. The shower was almost unusable. It came at one pressure setting-- "wake up a blackout drunk"-- and the shower curtain was very, very friendly with me. I eventually put it outside the tub for a couple minutes, and in that time the firehose pressure of the showerhead practically turned the bathroom floor into Lake Mead. This is a desert, guys-- ever heard of low-flow?. . THE UGLY: No outlets anywhere near the bed. This is 2014. We all lie in bed and play with our phones before we fall asleep, and wake up to alarms we set on them. If you don't have an outlet within reach of the bed, your hotel is stuck in the 1990s. Period.. . Side notes about management: very long line for check-in even at almost midnight. Staff is friendly, however. Didn't encounter one staffer who wasn't a pleasure to speak with. . . If you want classy or luxurious, stay at the Wynn or Bellagio. If you have money and want fun, stay at Caesar's. But if you're mainly looking for a decent place to crash once your three-foot-long daiquiri cup runs dry, the Flamingo will do ya.
Stayed in the go room and really enjoyed it . . PROS: . - Room had a mini fridge, two counters on the sides of the bed, window curtains that opened with a switch, Bose speakers with stereo, flat screen tv, tv in the bathroom, nice shower and seperate bath tub, and a couch next to the window.. - updated look . - in the middle of the strip so easy to get to a lot of places. - had a view of the pool and linq . - GO pool was really nice . -had great customer service at the front desk when adding another night . CONS:. -Most of the elevators our first two nights were not working so took a really long time to get up and down. -check-in/out line was really long at all times of the day which made it difficult if you had any problems . -buffet was very disappointing . Went for lunch and all they basically had was some Chinese, fried chicken , shrimp,  beef , sandwiches, not so good salad bar , and desserts. Just wondering were the Mexican or pizza or orange chicken was haha. . . Overall a very good experience with the room and customer service. Restraunts in flamingo and check in not so good.
You can get to the parking on Flamingo drive or the main strip. Just remember there are a lot of people walking so it could take a second if you pull in that way. Free self parking 3rd floor and up.  I did not have any trouble with Valet parking it is in the back by the pool. . Check in was not so bad. We came early and there was a line..  Had friends drive up later that checked in at 4:15pm and they said they had no wait. The staff was really friendly. We got a free upgrade to the go deluxe with a view strip plus not early check in fee, SCORE! It was amazing, the room had a coffee maker and mini frig. I remember when the coffee was standard in a room. I saw the "gym" on the way and decided not to use since it was basically a shop with some equipment in the back. The adult pool was looked amazing. I don't smoke so I found that most of the casinos, not just the flamingo to be very Smokey for me, but I do live in Az where you can't even smoke next to the door outside. My guy smokes and he found it less smokey than most of the casinos in Az. My friends brought there kid. It is Vegas, so not much for them to do but walk around and take in the sights. Its mainly what I did, and I enjoyed it. :) . The only thing I didn't like was the promoters in the casino pushing for there place so hard. It was a little annoying to get stopped so many times by the same person. Only reason for a start down. But the promoters are everywhere, waiting to strike.
We reserved a luxury strip-view room, and a couple days later i called to make sure we can get a smoking room becuz we r smokers. They said they reserved us a smoking room. Then after waiting in a 45-minute line (on a sunday, no less) to finally check in, they said we didn't reserve a smoking room and no smoking rooms are available. I said "so u guys can't guarantee smoking or non smoking rooms?" And she said no, we cant. Sooooo now we r stuck with a room we don't want. I suggest u don't stay here when in vegas cuz they can't guarantee if u have have a smoking or nonsmoking room!! How horrible is that? What if u have kids and r stuck in a room that smells like smoke? Just bad bad bad. Very disappointed.
Booked room do to price and location. I would've paid more to stay at another place.. I had to deal with a malfunctioning elevator, lack of hot water, cleaning service that didn't come in time, rooms not looking as good as advertised, and after talking to customer service they didn't bother to help. Would not go back.
The hotel was so cute for a bachelorette party! However, around 6pm Sunday night our toilet overflowed and did not stop for about 10 minutes leaving our bathroom completely flooded. Disgusting right? Not as disgusting as it was when we returned to our room at 3am to find nothing had been cleaned. We called the front desk at 6pm, we called again at 3am, and finally the bathroom was cleaned up around 4am. The hotel would only return a petty $44 resort fee, rather than refund the night and gave me the go-around with the third party booker (lasvegas.com). I couldn't find a way to directly reach the manager by email, so why not let them know in the open how terrible the customer service was. A flooded, probably e-coli infested bathroom for not 1 or 2, but 10 HOURS (!!!!) is insane, and they should have immediately insisted on refunding the night. Not to mention no one could use the bathroom before or after our night out.
We stayed in GO deluxe room for 2 nights on August 2014. This is the second time we stayed at the Flamingo hotel; the first was in the Fab deluxe room. First, I want to say that we got a room upgrade from GO deluxe room with king bed (high roller view) into GO mini suite out of nowhere.. . At the first glance, the rooms (bedroom and living room) are clean. Decor was quite pink, so if you do not like pink, you should stay away from GO deluxe room at Flamingo. Bed was quite stylish and comfortable. Bathrooms (2 of them in the mini suite) are very clean. We did not have trouble adjusting the water temperature.. . We were very pleased of the view we got. From our room, we can see the flamingo habitat as well as the high roller. At night, the high roller view was breathtaking (at least the first couple times you see it). . . Two things that prevent me from giving it a five-star:. 1. We had trouble finding electrical outlet to charge our laptop and cell phones. I was finally able to find the outlet somewhere hidden beneath the table. Unfortunately, this lead me to discover a bigger disappointment (point #2). 2. The carpet at the bottom of that table was so sticky. Somebody must have spilled some drinks there and the custodian failed to notice it. . . Although the sticky carpet was a huge disappointment, we had a lot of fun in the room watching the high roller from our living room. Since the sticky carpet is kinda in a hidden place (I would've not encountered it if it was not because I was trying to find the electrical outlet), we did not even remember that it was there.. . On the positive side, GO deluxe (room or the minisuite) has refrigerator, which allow us to buy beverages outside the hotel and chill them there. This was a huge plus for us since most hotel rooms do not include refrigerator. Also, Flamingo is located right at the middle of the Vegas strip. This is another huge plus for us.. . Overall, it was a great experience, and I would not mind staying at Flamingo again the next time we visit Vegas.
I've stayed at the Flamingo many times due to it being right in the center of the Strip. This is a bit of an old hotel but they have been trying to clean up by remodeling all of their rooms. I prefer the GO room which is contemporary with a splash of some retro style. How long are you going to stay in your hotel anyhow when being in Vegas!?! Now that they have started charging the resort fee at all of the Caesar hotels I may think twice now of staying at one.. . One great thing I love about this hotel is that when you walk out of the hotel you don't need to walk a mile to get onto the Strip. The Caesar's is directly across of the Flamingo which is a great plus since we usually go to Club Pure and the many eateries there.. . The Flamingo has a great 21 and over pool with live entertainment on many weekends. This is nice when you don't want a bunch of kids running around and splashing water everywhere. If I am leaving my kids at home I sure don't want to be bothered by other people's kids.. . I hope that they remodel the entire hotel and provide better eating/entertainment options at the Flamingo if they want to stay competitive to the other hotels in Vegas.
I like to Gamble here.  Wish they had more wheel of fortune slots.  Parking garage is always full.  Rooms are basic however the Go rooms are nice and modern.
We come here every year and love the party atomsphere the young the old just a great time had by all :)))
