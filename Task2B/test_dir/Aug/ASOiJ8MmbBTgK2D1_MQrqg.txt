The Skinny: come here for the view - not for the food (2.5)service: solid but not high end restaurant level (3) value: overpriced for the cuisine but a great view of the Bellagio fountains (2.5 starred review bump up to 3 stars).. . We came for the brunch menu last weekend after receiving our annual coupons from Lettuce Entertain You.. . We went in to try their brunch prix fixe and also to try a few a la carte items.. . After making an Open Table reservation, we choose the earliest seating at 11 am. Despite arriving at the hostess area at 11 am, we were asked to sit in a small area for a while as they set up our table. They seated us with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains.. . Overall the cuisine sounds very elegant but in reality, it's just subpar French bistro cuisine with better plating. I get to that again in a moment.. . We chose the brunch prix fixe menu - the mushroom strudel appetizer, the steak and eggs, and the "frozen" strawberry souffle for $39. We chose the foie gras tourchon appy and the curry chicken pie entree as well.. . We were treated to two slice of baguette with some butter to start. The bread was warm but other than that, nothing special. Really, it's the same thing that likely gets served at Mon Ami Gabi. This is in stark contrast to when they used to serve warm cheese gourgeres.. . Amuse was a zucchini parfait. The zucchini parfait itself was good however it unfortunately was served with these odd pastry sticks which were hard yet not crispy, chewy and flavorless. It really detracted from the zucchini parfait itself. A bad plating decision that pops up again and again throughout the meal.. . The mushroom strudel was kind of strange. Made of filo pastry, it's mostly made out of spinach rather than mushrooms. The spinach was surprisingly bland and you couldn't really taste the mushrooms due to the lack there of.  At least the parmesean cheese sprinkled above and below the filo pastry crust imparted a bit of umami to the dish but otherwise I can't recommend ordering this dish.. . The foie gras tourchon was a disappointment - it wasn't nearly as luscious as I expected. Served with some brioche toast, the fig compote had a odd kind of fermented flavor to it as well as being too thick to be spread easily. Decidedly meh and I wouldn't recommend it.. . From the starters to the entrees, there was a good 30 minute wait between. Luckily the view was nice so we didn't mind as much but there is obvious a timing issues in the kitchen.. . Steak and eggs were ordered medium rare and came out medium-well. I'm not one to send stuff back usually. Plus given the long wait between the dishes, I just went with the flow. The quality of the steak was good and the meat was tender. The potatoes and red pepper hash underneath was delicious. Unfortunately the blanched spinach was unseasoned and therefore completely bland which diluted the flavors of the dish. It was okay, but once was enough.. . Chicken curry pot pie was essentially a version of chicken tikka masala baked under a puff pastry crust. The filling was underwhelming and slightly overly acidic. It really needed something to mellow the flavor out a bit. It was also missing a bit of that smokiness from real chicken tikka. It definitely need some dried fenugreek leaves to give it a more authentic flavor. I don't think I would recommend ordering this.. . We split their "frozen" strawberry souffle. I kind of had a beef with that. Call a spade a spade - it's just ice cream molded into a ramekin to look like souffle. Word.. . Anyway, the ramekin ice cream block with sprinkled pistachio was alright. In my honest opinion, I got more enjoyment from a grocery store purchased ice cream than this stuff.  The strawberry ice cream was overly firm and had a weird Cool Whip consistency when melted slightly. This contrasted to the more icy texture of the Grand Marnier ice cream on the bottom. This was a grade D in the level of desserts. It was okay because it was a part of the prix fixe but I would have been down right pissed if I'd ordered a la carte. Save your pennies and head over to a half decent gelati joint and be way more happy.. . At the end you get some chocolates (tastes like Cadbury chocolates and certainly nothing really special) and some fruit flavored jellies.. . Service, in general is good. Water glasses were filled through out the meal and food was served promptly and at the proper temperatures. Our waiter was courteous and helpful. However it was missing the small attention to detail that differentiates a truly high end restaurant (such as - describing your dishes in detail, removing the wine glasses as soon as they know you're not going to order wine... stuff like that).. . This joint exemplifies the rule for "view" restaurants: the quality of the food is inversely proportional to the view. Added the price premium for the location, I would not recommend this place as a top choice for a romantic dinner for 2. 2.5 starred review with a bump up to a 3 starred review.
Lived up to the hype!! Lucked out and got the corner table, Saturday night, sunset!! Wow. Order the sampling menu. The pace of service, tastes, and amazing view made for one of my top 5 dining experiences ever. Prepare to spend $400 for the full experience, but for a special occasion (our anniversary ) it was worth. Make reservations and check in early, them wait for the right table... Totally worth it.
You pay for the ambience.  Amazing views of the strip can't be beat. The food is solid if not spectacular.  Had the market greens,  smoked salmon,  grilled shrimp,  and wild escargot appetizers.  The highlights were the salmon and the escargot,  which was brilliantly prepared.  The main dishes were large portions of the snapper, salmon,  and pork chop.  The potatoes au gratin were a hit at the table.  Excellent service and  good food in a nice upscale atmosphere.  If not a bit overpriced it would be five stars
The food was wonderful, although overpriced and not the best I had the service and atmosphere make up for it. If you want to impress someone take them here. You have a wonderful view of the bellagio water show. We didn't have reservations, although it was on a Monday night at 10 pm they took us immediately to the best seat in the house. Id highly recommend.
We been to the Eiffel Tower many times. The view and the ambience is amazing. There were four of us and I had the halibut which was overcooked not very flavorful. The New York was delicious. . . We had better service and food on our previous visits. Not sure why because it was a Monday night and not that crowded.
I didn't like the food. But view is breathtaking! Perfect place for first time visitors. Ask for a table next the window!
WAY overpriced!  Great view and friendly staff but food is out of this world expensive!!  Drinks are as well!  That is why you have to take an elevator up so you don't run away screaming when you see the prices.  Food = above average.
My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary last year and it was perfect. Our waiter was so knowledgeable and had a great personality. We sat at a table in the left corner right against the glass -- the view of the strip and fountains was beautiful during the evening. The food and cocktails were amazing. I hope to come back soon.
great food. Great view.
We had the Filet of Trout ($22) and the New York Strip ($32) and both were very tasty! The service was great and a view to match.. I suggest dining during lunch (11:00AM-3:30PM) for a lesser price point!. I'll be back again!!!!
We celebrated our Fourth Wedding Anniversary here. You should try their Caesar Salad it was so delicious.  The Souffle  are to die for. Servers are good too!
What a great experience! We made a reservation and our table was ready when we arrived. The view was wonderful overseeing the Bellagio fountains.  The food was excellent and the service superb.  Could not have asked for a better dining experience. This is now one of our top dining spots in Vegas.  The only downside was that we had to pay a $50 per person deposit when the reservation was made.
Pistachio souffle - we come here JUST for that incredible piece of heaven! Don't have to always have dinner, if you sit at the bar you can enjoy a glass of wine and dessert! . The bartender is super nice, she always remembers us.
This was our 3rd visit here.  . . On our first visit, my wife and I had ordered the Dinner Tasting Menu.  It was a 5 course meal in which we paired with a bottle of wine.  The view was amazing as we were sat right next to the window.  Unfortunately, the food was very forgettable and nothing impressed us.... (This was about 2 years ago. . On our second visit, my wife and I dined here for lunch. I don't remember what we had... but once again nothing impressed us once again!. . Third time's the charm right?. Yep! The wifey and I came in for dinner on one of my days off from work.  We didn't expect much but we decided to give here another try before writing this place off for good.. . The service was great and the food here was A LOT better than before.  I am not sure if they have changed the menu, but the food was definitely an improvement.. . We ordered:. . Appetizers. - Smoked Salmon (not bad). - Butter Poach Maine Lobster (really good, get this!). - Alaskan King Crab with Melon (great as well). . Entrees. Beef Wellington (yummy, the pastry was cooked to perfection). Broiled Filet Mignon with Foie Gras (this was the best part of dinner!). Crispy Potato Croquette (good stuff). . Dessert. Chocolate Souffle (worth the calories). . All in all, service was great, food was actually memorable this time! Maybe it was the perfectly cooked Foie Gras that pushed me over the edge.  The view is always a plus here.
My experience at this restaurant was lovely. Aside from just loving the company I was in while there, I also loved the ambiance, the view, the service (Roman was our server), and the cuisine. The design and decor of the restaurant is very underwhelming; accordingly, I deducted one star. However, the cuisine, service, and view of the Bellagio fountains more than make up for the lackluster decor.
