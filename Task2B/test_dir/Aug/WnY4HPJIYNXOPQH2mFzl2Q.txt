Stayed at THEKing suite which is supposed to be one of the newly renovated rooms that will be the 'Delano' later in 2014. This room was definitely one of the most luxurious and spacious rooms we've stayed at compared to Hilton, Hyatt, etc rooms. It had a separate living area with a couch and TV, perfect if you have children or an additional guest. The bathroom had dual vanity and a ridiculous amount of space, great for the wife who needs tons of room to get ready. . The hotel over all is truly a resort in that you can spend your whole vacation at the hotel because it has everything you want; restaurants, clubs, bars, shopping, pools.  Everything is plural because there are several of each. I'm not a Vegas expert but it's my understanding Mandalay Bay has the biggest and best pool area. It has a wave pool, lazy river, 21+ pool area, daytime club pool, every kind of pool you could want. Except for a quiet pool area which I guess you wouldn't want if you are going to Vegas. Plenty of more good things to say about the Mandalay Bay but I don't feel like writing an essay. If you don't mind spending a little money more than the average hotel, this place is with it.
T H E   S C E N E: THEhotel is a separate suites-only hotel on the Mandalay Bay Property. All resortists are allowed free-reign on the property and you can visit the Four Seasons, Mandalay Bay and even Luxor and Excalibur, as they all have a connecting point by way of the tram. . . THEhotel, however, is soon to be no more as it is reincarnated as the Delano. The sign isn't lit up, yet, on the Strip, and the original name is a bit confusing to some, so the new change appears to be quite welcomed. Resortists (as they call their patrons) are generally families and couples. It feels more aimed at play than party 'til sloshed. But there are chances to party 'til you drop, if that's more your speed. . . T H E   R O O M S: Basically bigger than the size of an average apartment in San Francisco or NYC. Ranging $179-500 per night, the suites are comfortably appointed, safe, clean, organized. The beds are soft and roomy, with these incredible pillows that are oddly heavy and sturdy, but still as soft as the bosom of a goose. I've never had such a good nights sleep. . . THEhotel, being at the end of the Strip, is not as chaotic or noisy as you might encounter in the beating heart of Las Vegas Boulevard. If too many people, noises and sounds give you sensory overload, you'll feel peaceful, while still enjoying the amenities. Smoking is allowed in some parts of the hotel, be sure to inquire where you are located. Smoking is 100% allowed all over Las Vegas, except office buildings.. . T H O U G H T S: To be frank, as they are under construction, they shouldn't be pushing to keep patrons coming in and out, when not all rooms / floors are available or ready for the public, their cafe, restaurant and other options are closed, and drilling and hammering can be heard, and construction crews are in the hallways with their gear, the temporary walls are also always changing, so it's a little confusing. The actual hotel room walls are a bit thin and I can hear conversations in the hallway and other commotion. But it's still better than a run-of-the-mill chain hotel off the Strip. A lot of construction goes on in Las Vegas, and the average project takes about four years or so. There is quite a bit of bureaucracy.. . P R O - T I P: Reserving a room online requires a credit card, but only covers the first night, and confirms you've booked the room. It doesn't add the credit card to your reservation until you show the credit card, in person. Debit cards are not permitted. If you attempt to use a debit card, you'll be charged the full fees up front, in cash. For example, if you're attending an event, and if your HR didn't complete the order correctly, THEhotel will not honour the reservation, give away your room, and require you to present the company card or have your HR department call them to provide details. If you arrive at 10p.m. on a Friday night, that could signal trouble. Call in advance to ensure a credit card is on file for your order, unless you have access to the credit card, or if you don't have credit cards, ensure you have cash and double what your room will cost, in case they require a holding fee, in addition to the incidentals fee of $200. Basically, you're penalized for *NOT* having a credit card. . . True story.
The hotel is modern. We stayed in a room where the sleeping area and the living room were separate which is always a good thing.  The only bad thing i have to say about it is the walls are super thin.
I havebeen attending the same conference for over a decade. They recently changed locations to Mandalay Bay.. . THEhotel is currently rebranding as the Delano Las Vegas. The website promised many things that weren't completed and were still under construction. It is still under construction and there were a number of issues that I experienced in my week long stay. . . 1) Elvis has not left the building. The TV in the living room area of the suite kept turning itself on. The building engineers came to fix it but it didn't work. I had to leave it unplugged when not in use. Apparently Elvis (or his ghost) likes tv.. . 2) The shower door doesn't shut properly. This was discovered by the train of animals crossing the bathroom floor 2 by 2. . . 3) Internet speed. When there was a signal, the speed was super slow. There was no signal to speak of in the suite's bedroom and there was only minimal signal in the living room area.. . 4) Ring around the tub. The tub in the masterbath had a ring around it. Ew.. . 5) Pillows. You know how most hotel pillows are floppy and light? Well THEhotel solved that problem by packing 23.4 lbs of old blue jeans in the pillow cases. They were super full and completely non-cushioning. I'm not sure what was really in the case, but I want it in my car bumpers.. . 6) Room service. Friday night room service took almost 2 hours. The waiter mentioned that my order got lost and the manager was proactive and kind enough to take 50% off the order charge. Additionally, none of the menu items were delivered as described in the menu - i.e. no croutons in the Caesar salad, no bread crusting on the bread crusted mac and cheese. . . 7) Mandalay Buffet. If you like Denny's, you'll like the Mandalay Buffet. Otherwise.... meh.. . 8) Conference area. Bring a day pack and a hiking stick as the conference area is about half a mile from the hotel towers. Seriously. . . 9) Leaky faucets. Despite the renovations for the room, one of the sink faucets in the bathroom kept dripping. I suspect that all the renovations at the hotel are superficial and entirely cosmetic. . . 10) The pool area. Like the convention area, the pool is incredibly inconvenient. Additionally,  when going to attend a private function at the Moorea pool area, we were asked for ID and denied access. I'm in my mid 40s. Apparently the justification for asking ID at this location (and only this location)  is that the area we were going to was a "liquor and gaming area." Given that it takes 15 minutes to walk there from the hotel tower, that was extremely annoying and completely unnecessary. . . I was expecting big things given the reputation of the Mandalay Bay. Overall, the experience was profoundly disappointing. I appreciated that the rooms had just been renovated (they still had that new room smell), but with the ongoing construction, the quality of the food and all the minor problems, I don't think I will be back.. . In a nutshell, don't believe the hype. Stay somewhere else.
Just visited the HOTEL soon to be renamed Delano...we actually stayed in their all new Delano room, the hotel room itself is well designed, but the customer experience was horrible, and deserved 0 star!. . The check-in took 45 minute when there were only 3-4 parties in front of me, although they are going through with their renovation, this is no excuse for the long wait.  We had specifically booked for a suite with 2 beds, but they weren't able to give us a regular room, so we ended up with a room that was designed for handicapped visitors (restrooms with handle bars).. . Upon entering the room, there trash left over from the previous visitor (unfinished drinks left on the table), and then the rest room there were half-washed glass cups (cuts with foams and not yet rinsed)....obviously someone was rushing to clean the rooms and forgot everything.. . Following morning, we requested for housekeeping by pushing the housekeeping button, but NO-SHOW, no housekeeping, we had to call again only to get a disgruntled cleaning lady who was very unwilling to come in and clean. After cleaning the room, and leaving, they left their cleaning detergents in the room.. . Overall, a very very poor customer service/experience for a very expensive room.
Lots of construction.  Expect jackhammering all night.  The staff was so great!!!.....they offered us earplugs as a solution.  Perhaps if we had booked the place at a discounted rate knowing what we were getting in to we would not have been disappointed.. . Also the new Delano rooms are hospital white.  Not a dollop of color anywhere.  Insane asylum sterile feeling.  Lost is the upscale elegance as these new rooms combine brass with chrome and white!!  . . WEIRD
The big secret construction project .... . First of all I want to say I have stayed at the property a dozen times in the past, and it had been wonderful, but in my opinion the ownership has ruined this property, When I showed up to "The Hotel at Mandalay Bay", I had my 1st surprise pulling in the parking deck, "The hotel at Mandalay Bay"  is in the middle of a name change (new hotel name Delano")  its having a identity crisis, plus its going through a  complete remodel,  the lobby is torn up, god forbid if you want a drink in Vegas because surprise there's no bar, no lobby furniture, no restaurant, no gift shop, no coffee or snack bar the place is in giant construction mode, you can't even sit down in the lobby, not even a chairto sit on or a couch to sit on, I am in the lobby watching hotel guests sitting on the floor like there in a fine Japanese restaurant on the floor! As much fun as that sounds not today! Don't you think the hotel should have said something during booking? How about an email prior to arrival? This would at least have given you a chance to move to a different hotel. Here the most insulting part they offered a $50 credit on a $2000 room bill for the inconvenience. And to this day they still don't mention the construction on their website. Do yourself a favor STAY AWAY? . While in my remodeled room in the new Delano my surprises just keep coming......... 1. The complementary high speed internet is really not high speed at all, its 3 MBPS, but for $20 dollars a day you can upgrade. . 2. The in room coffee is gone! Can't find it! . 3. The pillows were new and felt like left over walls of the old hotel, like bricks, I thought that went with the new earthy feel of Delano! . 4. And if you're looking for some place to hang your clothes after a long day of travel, surprise there is no closet! . 5. Towels- I called 3 times to get more towels! Surprise still waiting. . 6. Bedding- in Vegas, outside the temperature was 107 degrees, so surprise they had used goose down comforters on the beds, let's heat up everything. . 7. Water in the shower- this is the place you want hot, the water ran for 7 minutes and never got hot, I will give the engineering people credit by the 4th day and I did check out they got the wait time for hot water down to 4 minutes. . If you decide you want to bet in Las Vegas, make the best bet you can, and this wouldn't be one of them!  Stay away!
The Hotel is really far from the strip,  I kind of felt stuck because we would have to drive everywhere.  The only pro about this hotel istheir beach/pool!  I had the most fun on this Vegas trip when I spent 1 hour at the pool! lol  The lazy river was super fun, went around like 10 times! Loved the waterfall part.  Tubes are for rent, $22.  I don't think you need it because I didn't rent one and I still had a blast!  The beach was a lot of fun.  The waves come every 1 min and 20 sec.  I don't know why it's set at such a random time.  There are sand at the beach.  . . The room I stayed at was newly renovated, which is later going to be renamed Delano.  There are construction going on with the hotel right now, but it wasn't an issue in any ways.  Bed was comfy, but pillows were way too hard.  I slept without a pillow during my two nights stayed.  The suite has a living room and separate bedroom.  There are two restrooms, but only one bath/shower.  The main bathroom is spacious enough for girls to get ready.  . . Light nightclub is downstair, which is a major plus because it's one of the biggest club in Vegas right now.  Hotel guests get $10 discount admission, girls are free before 11pm.  Something about if the girls and guys are even in ratio, guys get in for free as well.  It all varies though on how busy that night is or which DJ is playing. . . Overall 3.5 for this hotel.
Wonderful room! The construction going on in the hotel made it a bit confusing to navigate but it is a beautiful hotel. The woman at the reservation desk seemed to be confused and looked at the computer for about 10 minutes before telling us that they had lost our room. She was unwilling to let us speak to a manager claiming that there was nothing that they could do. After insisting that we speak to the manager our selfs, the manager was very professional and was able to upgrade our room to a better view. Arrival was a bit confusing but the room made up for the inconvenience.
Lots of Noise during a remodel not announced or listed on the website.  I noticed during the morning of our second day there drilling sounds, sounds of multiple wheels.  I mentioned this to front desk.  Got $50 food and beverage credit.  TV in bedroom would not turn on, didn't seem to be able to get hot water in the shower.  It's a schlep walking everywhere.  There are fees for everything.  There was a $25 usage fee for me to use hot tub and steam room.  It's a nice facility but I've never paid an add on for this, also prices for other spa services were outrageous.  Staff is friendly.  I are at the buffet twice and had a gut ache each time and I didn't over eat there.  For the amount of money paid,  I think would have received better overall room stay experience at Luxor or MGM grand.  I like the stay but felt it was over priced.
There's nothing that I didn't like about TheHotel. We stayed for a friend's birthday and everything was fine. Not amazing, but perfectly fine.. . Finding the hotel and the check-in process went very smooth. We got up to our room and everything was clean and the room was a lot nicer and roomier than I expected!. . Throughout our stay, we had requested for extra towels and other small things and everything was done promptly. . . The only thing that went wrong in our room was when our bathroom door handle had been jammed and we were unable to open the door from the outside.. We called maintenance and they came 0 to 100 real quick. They opened the door for us and had it fixed within 15 minutes. . . All in all, I would stay here again. It was a nice stay-cation on the strip and we had no problems with the hotel.
