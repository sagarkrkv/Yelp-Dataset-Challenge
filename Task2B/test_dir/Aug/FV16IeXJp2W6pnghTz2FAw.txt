This place is open 24hrs!? I came for lunch. Superrr hungover. And my usual pho place was randomly closed! Came here because of the time heh heh. And stayed because there was a wait, and when there's a wait the food must be good, right? . . I got pho tai and it was really good. I don't usually drink all the broth but this time I couldn't help myself. We also got the vermicelli pork dish which was also good! . . Our bill was less than 20$ and there was so much food!
Delicious food! Great decor. Too bad I can't say the same thing about their service.. We were in a party of 3, they brought one dish out and took forever to bring out the pho.
Just visiting from out of town and had dinner at this spot. Food was just what I needed (combo pho). Hesitated because of the bad service reported in the previous reviews, but my experience was great. Service was fast, efficient and friendly. Only 4 stars since I am from out of town- can't give 5 stars to a place I've only gone once.
This place wins the worst pho in Las Vegas. They give pho a terrible name. I decided to try this place regardless of the bad reviews and it was a waste of my $20. . I had a small pho tai and my girlfriend got a small pho tom (shrimp.) . The broth was watered down and tasted nasty. The portion for a small $9 bowl is ridiculous. I had literally 3 pieces of steak. The shrimp was undercooked. . Barely any noodles. They don't even have black pepper at the tables. What kind of "Vietnamese Cuisine" is this? I understand it is also Chinese but the menu is in Viet with English in small font, so why is the pho phoking disgusting? . I am Vietnamese and take pride in my culture and especially the food. . I would never recommend this to anyone and I will never step foot in here again. . Truly disgusted. Waste of time. Pho jenny down the street for late night pho even beats this place. Yuck!. Also, the service is horrible. Once you get your food, they don't come back to check on you. I had to get up to ask for more limes to try to make the soup bearable.
I've been going here since I was little on family trips to Vegas. So I know how much it has changed. . . This use to be the spot where we'd invite family and friends to eat whenever we're all in town at the same time. . . The food here is no longer good. I think due to the 24/7 hours, they've changed the way they make their food and it's no good. . . The pho isn't good at all. The soup doesn't have the beef flavor in it at all, it just doesn't taste how pho should taste. . . The service here sucks. You're already waiting in a long ass line just to finally get in and wait some more. Once you're seated, the waiter/waitress will just give you your menus and leave...not even dropping off water. Sometimes it'll take almost 30mins until they comeback to take the order. . . The last two times I went were not good at all. . . I went with my friend and we were seated in a corner and completely forgotten about. . . Another time, I went with my parents and sister. My sister ordered the chow fun and the waiter messed up our chow fun order with another. When we told him the order was wrong, he got the chow fun from the other table and gave it to us to eat...the other table had already eaten out of it.... . The prices have gotten a lot more expensive as well.
This place had a cute setting and it was huge!  didn't think it would be that big until I went inside.  . . the pho here was okay.  I wasn't impressed.  I like the other pho place more, but I don't remember the name.. . I also got to try their bun bo hue and didn't really like it either.. . overall, it's okay but I've had better
Best Sea Food Chow Fun, Pho and spring rolls in Vegas. The staff is also really nice.
The 24/7 pho spot. I've been here a few times. One time at 7 in the morning they were bumping EDM. Not cool when you're hungover. Other than that, the food is decent.
This place open 24 hours and I love it was a great food. Very good times whit my son it's a good place to come. I very happy to come this place you have to try and put your review. Thanks
This place is the "it" from Chinatown! The food is excellent and it comes out really fast! Everything is very savory and fresh. . . The best appetizer is the eggrolls accompanied with the greens and I always get #23 with extra shrimp added. . . The only down part is that the place is always packed and the servers are really cold-dry! (I guess that makes it more authentic) lol . . The Hispanic guys that are there balance out the service. They're very attentive and nice.. . Worth to try! I'm a regular.
I really wish I didn't have to write this review. But if I don't share this experience, I'm not being true to my Yelp self or my fellow Yelpers out there. Every restaurant has a bad night and I have been going to Pho Kim Long since before moving to Las Vegas. The service is efficient and the food always delivers, whether you are there at 7pm or 4 in the morning. But recently I had an experience that has put me off of my beloved go-to spot possibly forever. . . It all started on a busy Friday night around 3am. I had a craving for some Pho after work. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table because they were jam packed, slammed, crazy busy. No problem. I get it. Not the end of the world. . However, once we were finally sat all the way in the back in a corner, nobody came to take our order. There were servers, bussers and runners all scurrying around us too busy to even take a beverage order. The first 10 or so minutes I can forgive but when I actively am trying to flag someone down and literally every employee refuses to make eye contact, even I start to get frustrated. We became the table that time forgot. . . 15 minutes...20 minutes go by.. 25 minutes in and we still don't even have a glass of water. We have now been at Pho Kim Long for a total of 40 minutes with nothing to show for it. But I refuse to be that person who makes a scene and leaves, so I wait it out. . I FINALLY flag down the guy bussing the table next to ours and he brings us some waters and promises to send the server over. She comes over looking rather (understandably) bedraggled and we very politely put in our order after explaining our situation. She offers no apology and acts as if it's not a big deal. So I'm a little peeved at the lack of reaction. But my pho is on the way and my stomach is growling. . My beautiful bowl of soup is placed before me and I turn my attention away from the negative experience and grab my chopsticks. And then I see it...gently floating amongst my rice noodles, swimming in my delicious broth without a care in the world is...a.... COCKROACH. . . I stand up, push my bowl away and just point in astonishment and horror. My confused dinner companion sees what I am pointing at and flags down the nearest employee who proceeds to whisk the dish away before I have a chance to gather my wits and take a picture. So now we are both standing at the table trying to figure out what to do. NOBODY comes back over to inquire about us or make amends. So we look at each other, nod and start walking towards the front door. On the way I find our server and take her aside to calmly explain the entire situation and inform her that we are leaving. And I again get a complete non reaction. No apology, no manager. Just an ok and a bewildered stare.. . I'm done.
Lunch service is horrible,  I had to write about it.  I've been 1 time at dinner,  3 times for lunch.   They are super slow once you get to your table, our server acted annoyed to answer questions and gave the impression he had better things to do.  Food is still great, dinner crew bussers works hard.  Sad face for trying to beat the crowd.
This place is flippin amazing. I live in Las Vegas and this place never fails to amaze me. Always quick seating and the food comes out right away. Definitely a spot for after hours. I LOVE pho Kim long!!
I like this place. I've been here two times. One time for a dine-in with my boyfriend and second time for a pick-up order. Both times were good. Food was also really good and hit the spot. Although food was good, I think the customer service needs a lot of work and in having the same server too. I would definitely add more stars if the customer service improved, to be honest.. The first time for dine-in, I swear we had 3 different servers come to us and then when we asked about a boba drink to one of the workers there, they looked so lost and confused like they didn't know what boba was and was surprised that it was on their menu. So on and so forth, we got what we wanted.. The second time for pick-up was alright. The host was chill. Food took a while, but then again, it's usually always so busy there because it's a 24-hour place.. All in all, place is pretty good and the price isn't too bad.
Service is horrible !  Simple as that . I felt like regulars and member of the same race was being favored I waited 15 mins for the table which doesn't bother me at all ! If your busy that's fine . I sat down and waited for 10 mins no water or anything was brought to me ... 20 mins passed I flagged down a busser and informed him I was ready to order can he notify my sever 30 mins passed . And nothing I told my wife to just wait a lil longer and nothin . After 35 mins they can we ordered and I waited for my 23 mins for my food it arrived I ate and had to wait another 24 mins for my check ...
Ugghhh. Oh my! This place was alright the first two times and especially because of the take-out order I made the other day, I decided to come back. It was pretty busy, like how it usually is, so I waited. The host barely even noticed me. He didn't notice me until I asked him for an order to-go... Anyhow, I barely even got to look at the menu he handed me and he already asked me what I wanted, so I just basically ordered what I ordered last time which was chicken chow fun for me and orange chicken with a side of rice for my boyfriend... It took a while, but it was fine, whatever, because it's busy. I went back to the front to wait for my food and like 10 minutes later, the same host who helped me asked me if I had been helped... -_- Anyways, I paid right when the host gave me the receipt, but when my food came out, he brought me back to the cash register and tried to have me pay again. Luckily one of the workers there saw that I paid and said that it was okay.. I finally took the food home and what do you know?! There is HAIR in the orange chicken... Long black hair. Not just one, but two strands... And maybe more. But I just threw the food away... Blahhh, I'm so disappointed. This is not ok. I tipped too (because I usually always tip) but this is unacceptable!
Everytime I'm in vegas it seems I HAVE to stop here at any time of day. Their food is amazing and portions are good to share! I took my would be husband here for the first time and he loved everytime we had. Definitely try the black bean small clams, calamari serving was huge, house pan fried noodles were perfectly crispy! And if you have  leftovers, i swear they are better later! (Especially after a few drinks) Pho Kim Long is a tradition for me to stop by everytime here. I"ll be back here next time and next time again (until i move here)
Signed in (8 names deep) to wait in line because so many people and their kids come here. Didn't wait long, like 5-10 minutes. Ordered food and by the time I took a sip of water our food was out. I ordered spring rolls and a large bowl of the special pho and it was excellent. Our waitress Kelly was so nice. Definitely a place to go for Vietnamese food.
Food was not a home run.  It was just so so.  Actually kind of disappointed.  Service was terrible.  In a certain way, it felt like a fast food joint.  Never coming back again
I walked in and used the bathroom, to see a dead big cockroach by their toilet. Then the server Leo (who I hear has been working there for a long time) has a major attitude. Very rude and unacceptable. I don't care if you hate your life, it doesn't mean you can be a major jerk to others. The food however was very good. Don't let Leo serve you, he will just spoil your mood with his stank face. . The owner needs to hire another server who can at least smile and take orders with a good attitude. The women staff was terrific.
The service sucked and it wasn't that busy when we arrived.  Appetizer came out on time, but they forgot about our main entree.  We asked 3 different waitresses(nobody checked on us, we had to track them down) and they said they would go check but never did. Waited 30mins for our main entree after our appetizer.
Shitty service but great hangover food after getting messed up in Vegas.
Great idea from valet at the Cosmo to come here! This location in China town felt like an ok area at 3am. I would suggest giving yourself 30 min head start when needing a cab to leave. The pho was amazing and huge portions! Great value for the $$. Way better than eating at the hotels! Service was good and the egg rolls were yummy!
Food is getting worse and worse every time I came. I get very disappointed even though this is nice place. :((
Best late night Asian dining in Vegas, for sure. The pho and other traditional Vietnamese food is great, but surprisingly their Orange Chicken is also fantastic. I know, I know. You're going to chastise me for ordering American Chinese food at a Vietnamese restaurant, but it's something you have to taste to believe. Add a little Hoisin sauce and you're off to Flavor Country.
Pretty great standard fair Pho, but missing the more exotic options like tripe or tongue. The decor is mid upscale. Unfortunately the service leaves something to be desired. Prepare to feel abandoned.
This place gets a lot of hype. It's good. But I wasn't overwhelmed.. . Pho is solid - can't go wrong with any of the choices.. I also tried the clams in black bean sauce (good), fried mussels (ok) and mayonnaise shrimp with walnuts (good).. . They asked if we wanted rice, we said yes. Was charged $3. Wish they said something before we saw it on the check. Plus, most places give you white rice for free if you order mains (I can understand if we just ordered pho).  3 mains (in addition to a pho per person) and I'm charged for rice? I'm big on principle.. . It's a good deal compared to 99% of restaurants on the strip (for those visiting) but by the time you add in cab fare round trip, it loses some of its value.. . But if you're craving pho after a long night of partying - can't go wrong.. (though I would also suggest the noodle restaurant at Venetian - its closer, soupy and relatively not pricey)
Fast and affordable. The Singapore noodle is the best in town.. Always busy for a reason.
We are here in Vegas fo a 4 days vacation with kids and friends. Craving for some VN foods and went to Pho Kim Long. Foods was ok but the service was horrible. We needed some scoops for our pho soup that none of the bowl had come with. We ask for them but the guy/owner didn't even acknowledge me while I am looking at him for about a minute then he asked what do I need. I thought that was insulting. One of the friends ask for some condense milk. The response of the waiter was what do you need it for. That was unnecessary. Because it is open early we like to start our day early. We like to enjoy our precious day here in NV. Thanks Pho Kim Long for ruin our day. Just a friendly reminder for who is looking an enjoyable vacation please avoid this place at all cost. For us we will never come here again. Hope they will learn to share their customer with a little respect. If there is an option with zero star rating. I will rate them zero star rating.

Long  wait times for mediocre food that is bland with no taste.   Tried the pho  tai  regret ordering it,  soup was so bland with no flavor and the meat was dry with no flavor.   The vegetables provided was obviously not fresh also. My group didn't like what they ordered also.   Never going to this place again whenever I'm in Vegas, and they definitely are not what they claim as best in Las Vegas.
