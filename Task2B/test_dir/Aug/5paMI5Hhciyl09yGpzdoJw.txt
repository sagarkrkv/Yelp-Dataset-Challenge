2.5 stars tops.... . Going to keep this short.. . Good: The rooms are spacious, well appointed and cleaned daily before 1pm Only annoyance was the pay-for-tray of water and nuts placed and secured right in front of television.. Good: The pools are numerous, the chaise lounge chairs are numerous and picked up after by the pool attendants. Pool is open until 8pm. Fair: Casino and casino drink service. Casino is a bit small, and for the low budget slot player that i am, very limited variety of slots. Drink service seemed to be omnipresent during the morning hours but difficult to find in the evening. . Poor: The absolutely obnoxious security theater when using the elevators to go to our room. Yelling at hotel guests because they didn't show the stupid key card was something that I finally went to management for. Of course, the young manager gal responded by just spouting out the same lines that the folks who believe 911 is valid enough for everyone to be on the lookout. Probably would never go back because of this bs.. . Too bad.
love this hotel! I've stayed many years ago several times. We just stayed this weekend and it's still the same, however there is slight aging in some of the furniture. Nothing bad, but you can see a bit in the wood of the bench etc. The room was spacious, clean and classic decor. . The hotel smells nice and airy compared to most hotels. (we've also stayed at their sister hotel Venetian and like that as well) What we love the most is the location. Central on the strip and close to all the action. Everything you need is here. Restaurant Row for foodies (Puck, Batali, Legasse, Keller and even a new place by the cake boss) and also midlevel food options italian, asian noodles, grimaldis, Burgers and Beer and even coffee bean, a juicery, espressamente (gelato/ expresso etc) Walgreens is out front if you forget anything. There is also a higher end mall within. But you can also cross to get to fashion show mall. You really don't have to leave these 2 hotels. . The pool is great for us since we have a toddler and there's a large portion that is 1.5 ft. deep so he had a lot of room to swim/play. You can access all the pools at Venetian/Palazzo so you have many pool choices. There are several bars, Tao Club (Venetian) and also a day club so you if you're attending those, you don't need to walk far. The crowd is mixed with partiers, families, couples etc. Unlike the Cosmopolitan which is mostly younger/ partiers so if you want a nice solely "party hotel" chose the Cosmo, however they did have a lot of good-looking people dressed to club /dinner here as well. Bellagio & Wynn are comparable but a tad more upscale crowd.. Everyone was super friendly friendly to us as soon as we walked to the directory, we we were asked if we needed help, same at the pool area, elevators that i'm quite shocked by some bad reviews. Luckily we didn't have any power outtage issues like a reviewer experienced. . If you park close to where it says Front Desk, you'll have a short walk to registration and to the rooms. . Only cons are that the tub is a bit smaller (Trump and caesars palace had a huge 2 person tub while this is just a single) No free bottled waters, no fridge (it's a mini bar you have to pay for if anything is moved) So if you're looking of more of an apartment/suite type, maybe the trump or vdara.
Of the elite hotels on the strip, the Palazzo is certainly the best value, featuring huge suites that can sleep 6-7 people comfortably (2 per bed, 1 on couch, 2 on fold-out).  Thus, the Palazzo is an excellent choice for bachelor parties.  The best steakhouse in Vegas (CUT) is located just outside the casino, and one of the other best restaurants in town, Batali's Carnevino is near the lobby.  For pool-side action and nightclubs, you couldn't be in a better spot.  There are usually at least one or two celeb sightings, as there is typically an event going and the Palazzo is a bit more low-key than other high end hotels.  I've run into Paris Hilton, Jude Law, and Chris Paul on three separate weekends just by hanging out at the casino bar.  The concierge is incredibly helpful with snagging last minute tickets to hot shows even when you think they are sold out, so talk to them anyway -- my friends and I were able to score front row seats to La Reve the day of.  The only knock on the casino is that with opulence comes high table minimums, so expect to at least bet $15 on blackjack, etc.  If you're looking for cheaper stakes, T.I. is an easy walk across the street and has $10 tables all-day.  Bottomline, I wish I had the luxury to visit here more often!
The Palazzo needs to get their act together.  My family and I stayed here over 4th of July weekend and were pretty disappointed.  We asked for a non-smoking room, but we were given a room where some hooligan smoked some chains in.  We complained and they said because it was a holiday weekend, they could not offer us a new room and sent up an air filter that was supposed to suck up all the smoke.  I hardly believe, that a major resort doesn't have any extra rooms.  The air filter took over 2  hours to arrive at our room. . . We roamed around the strip for 4 hours and came back to a still stinky room.  Not to mentioned that thing was extremely loud.  The only compensation they could offer us was to take off our resort fees.  . . Not only was our room stinky, but the maids didn't do a good job of cleaning our room before we arrived.  A lot of toiletries were missing and small items like the bag for the ice bucket wasn't replaced.  Although they made seem like small things, when you're paying for a nice resort, you expect a well cleaned and stocked room.
I love this place. Have been a fan of the Venetians for many years now and finally have chosen the palazzo to be my new favorite spot to visit. The grand canal shops are a joy to visit. The experience of staying in a gorgeous room here is just to die for. I do still miss the Venetians
Our experience was definitely on the luckier side but I only factored it into my rating slightly. My girlfriend and I came in really late Friday night after driving for about 4 hours. Driving into the casino was quick and painless. We went to the lobby and talked to the receptionist, Katja, who was very sweet and kind. We booked our reservation through Priceline's "Express deals" and called ahead of time confirming that we will be checking in late. Turns out that there were no non-smoking king rooms left. Katja kindly upgraded us to the Siena Suite (almost 1300 square feet of space!). . The Good:. Huge room! Absolutely beautiful. . Very clean and modern. Room service did a great job. Nice views from the room. Casino area is large and spacious. Smoke smell is significantly diminished on the casino floor. Beautiful waterfalls and displays around the casino. Easy access to the Venetian (do not even have to go outside). Bed was large and comfortable. Bathroom had a jacuzzi tub and a multi-fauceted shower. . . The Bad:. Private security checking rooms keys before entering the theaters is a bit redundant.. Pool area was very crowded. Small TV, but who cares? Get out and gamble!. . Given the incredible deal we received and our upgrade. We were thoroughly impressed with the service and facilities here. I will likely come back and try and book through them again. Some reviews do look terrible but try and understand the circumstances they are in.
The home of great restaurants and nice ambiance..
No complaints!
The hotel lived up to expectations. It still doesn't match the Wynn, but it's a good place to stay if you can find a deal. . . Room: Large and comfortable. Every room is a suite; bedroom area connected to a sunken living room. Tipping $20 to check-in clerk led to an upper floor strip view. Unfortunately the "strip view" at the Palazzo isn't the best. More than likely you'll just be facing TI. The view of the mountains in the distance was nice. Having an upper floor was nice though, and definitely worth the extra $20 (tip).. . Casino: We didn't end up gambling here much due to higher table minimums, but it does seem smaller than most on the strip (not that that's bad necessarily). We did walk through often though, and it's a nice casino. Fresh and clean. Didn't smell like smoke, like many casinos do. . . Overall, I'd stay here again if the price/deal was good enough. For the "normal" price though, the Wynn is better.
**Update: I ended up dealing with Leann in risk management, and SHE was also great. Very diligent about call backs as well. She managed to get a reimbursement set up, so I'm upgrading this another star. They ended up doing right by the customer, just took them awhile!**. . I haven't been so disappointed in a hotel in a long time. Let me be clear, my disappointment is with staff, not with the property. I really like the property (which makes it a 2 star instead of 1), but probably won't be coming back because of the staff. . . My girlfriend left a phone charger in the room, and when I got off of work 4 hours later I went back to get it. Was told to call lost and found the next day, to which they said they didn't have it yet. We then stopped in the day after that to talk to someone in person... And we were given the run around. Bounced from security to concierge back to security, NOBODY giving any answers or taking any responsibility, and a bunch of people shrugging in a "I don't have any idea what you should do" kind of way. . . The security guard was older, and just seemed to not care. I told him I work at a similar hotel on the strip, I know phone chargers can go missing. He said yup, sometimes they just disappear (clearly implying employees take them). To which I asked, so because someone takes our phone charger we are SOL? He looked at us and nodded in confirmation. He also said sometimes phones themselves just develop legs and walk out never to be seen again... Really? Glad your employees didn't take a phone worth hundreds of dollars? Thank god it was just a charger? Phew!. . Shocked, we asked to file a security report. This is when we were handed over to Daniel, who was far and away the best person we dealt with at the palazzo. He is what customer service should be. He was nothing short of amazing. We walked him through where we left it, he said people leave chargers in that socket CONSTANTLY (it's on the opposite side of the wall divider between living room and the beds). He sympathized, did the report with us and everything. Spent like 30-45 minutes making sure we had everything done and were comfortable. HE was 5 star quality. . . He have me a number in risk management to call to follow up in 3-4 days, and to possibly ask for reimbursement. I waited 2 weeks to call because I was really busy working, but then I left 4 voicemails for Eugene Fitch in risk management over 2 weeks. She never called back. . . I called the general line, and somebody finally called me back a few days later...  Now a month after the stay. They couldn't find my report, but called me back later having located it. The result? Uh...lost and found didn't have it, so there's nothing we can do. . . Well, thanks for nothing Palazzo. You wasted ample amounts of my time, did nothing to fix a new $30 charger being left behind, even though we spent 5-600 dollars on property. I know that isn't a lot compared to other customers, but $30 is so trivial to lose a customer over. It wouldn't have bothered me as much either if the customer service wasn't so bad. I gave them ample time to respond, and got nothing. I don't know if Eugene Fitch actually exists. I can't think of any other customer service where someone would ignore FOUR voicemails!. . I find it hard to believe a 5 star establishment operates like this. I feel cheated and taken advantage of, particularly because I wasn't an a**hole to anyone. Someone who wanted to be a jerk would probably have been taken care of, I see that all the time. But because I understand what it's like in the industry, and assumed they would find a solution given enough time... I'm stuck with a "yeah, nothing we can do.". . I'll spend my money at Wynn or Bellagio in the future, and make sure to triple check for my charger before leaving!
Aweful door man. I was looking for shuttle to convention center. This guy whom I ask for direction, he told me " who told you that we have shuttle service in this hotel?". He really want to find out even before he answer my question. I ask him again the same question and he was pissed off. But customer service:( not helpful stuck up door man!
All I can say is WOW.  Worst customer service I've seen in my entire life.  We booked our "king bed" room well in advance of our stay, and arrived to find out they were "over 100% booked" and couldn't give us a king bed, butthey were "kind" enough to offer us a discounted rate for a suite with a king bed for just another $50...  We reluctantly said yes, and were shocked to find that the suite is the exact same room as a regular room but with a totally useless sitting area.  Thanks Palazzo!. . I've probably stayed here 50 nights, but I will never stay here again.  I'm afraid next time I show up they'll tell me they don't have any rooms with working bathrooms left but for $2,000 they can upgrade me to one that at least has a shower.  . . Congrats Palazzo, over $50 of nickel and diming you lost a great customer for life.. . Update: As if that's not bad enough, we've been waiting for our bags for 40 minutes now, I'm thinking maybe they are holding them hostage and going to ask for another $50 to bring them up.
This is my second time staying in Palazzo and it has been the best experience so far! Reception desk is professional, service at the pool and hotel staff is professional. Elevators are fast! Rooms are amazing, beautiful and clean. Everything in the room works! Room service is good. Huge pool area with several pools. Nothing to complain at all! Definitely will come back!
The Palazzo was everything we imagined it could be. We chose the Palazzo primarily for its location. . . The check in line was long upon arrival, but it moved in a steady pace and we were checked into our luxury suite rather quickly. All of the rooms here are suites, but we upgraded for a luxury suite to get a nice view. Our room was on the thirtieth floor overlooking the pool and the Strip. It wasn't much to look at during the day, but at night, it was breathtaking. . . The room was well appointed with a king size bed, full bathroom with quality toiletries. There were three TV's and a separate living area with sofa and loveseat. The sofa was a sleeper, we could've had two more people stay comfortably since the room was over seven hundred twenty square feet. . . The Palazzo is connected to the Venetian which was another plus. There is a Walgreens connected to the Palazzo on the bottom floor which made it extra convenient to get our bottled waters. . . We liked the fact that it's connected to the Venetian. With that in mind, the number of shops, restaurants, cafes, spas, and nightclubs are endless. I highly recommend the Palazzo if you want to take in as much as you can, on the Strip. . . Oh, and if you are environmentally conscious:. They recycle everything here!. The hotel runs on solar power, with thousands of solar powered panels on the roof tops, it's quite incredible! Everything is running off of the solar panels! . There are employees who are in charge of separating all of the waste, from plastic, paper, and compost waste. . Everything is recycled! . Pretty cool!
Very long check-in. Rude service. Housekeeping does a poor job cleaning the room. Pubes in the bathtub. TV didn't work, called to have it fixed, they said it needed to be replaced, but they took a day and a half to fix it. Total of four phone calls needed because they had closed our ticket without fixing the problem. . . Very high resort fees regardless of whether you use the amenities -- why not just add the fees to the daily rate? They said there would be a mini-fridge and a microwave. There was no microwave, and using the mini-fridge results in a charge, even if you don't eat or drink anything. Moving anything in the fridge results in an automatic charge. And they make it so you are forced to move something if you want to store your own perishable food, such as your leftovers.. . No tea or coffee in the room -- never seen that at any hotel, anywhere in the world.. . The suite is "large," but it is really split into two parts, one is a small room with a bedroom, and the other has a sofa, which I find of no use at all. The view was terrible.. . The show at the Palazzo is not good, and their "coupon book" that comes with the room only has coupons to terrible places. The places that are worth visiting don't offer coupons in that stupid book.. . The casino is not bad, but you can enter it and play without staying at this awful hotel. Worst hotel we have ever stayed in. Not at all worth its price tag (especially including the fees they don't mention anywhere).
This is my favorite hotel on the strip! Its the easiest hotel to get to off I-15! The suites are the perfect size with all the amenities. I'm always able to book a room near the elevators. I stay at this hotel because it has the best sports book in town (Lagasse Stadium). Also I have found the staff to be the most helpful and cordial.
i really liked this room. the space for two people was fantastic. I would definitely stay here again. price was good if you book early enough. . . automatic drapes and blinds are cool.. two lcd tvs, one large l shaped sofa in the seating area. nice bathroom etc etc. what you expect from a suite.
I came here for the day to meet my friend who was staying here with her family.  We were staying at another hotel.  We spent the day by the pool.  The pool was fantastic, super clean, and the water was the perfect temperature.  The lounge chairs were very comfy.  It was a bit of a hassle because you must have a room key to go up to a room and to the pool.  So, we had to wait in the lobby for my friend to come down and meet us.  I felt like a criminal : ).. . The rooms are nice, I think they advertise all rooms as suites, but my suite at the Tropicana was a lot bigger. . . We ate at Solaro by the pool.  Not impressed.  See my separate review.
We stayed here and the Encore in the same trip. My wife and I both liked the Palazzo much better! Better food choices by far with reasonable prices and open late. Rooms are huge and comfy and the pools are outstanding! Slots are ton loser as well!  If you can't make up your mind, Choose Palazzo! We are also a tad older (age 50) and the crowd was more our speed. My wife liked that all the girls weren't little pixy skinny, high maintenance 20 something's. Sorry if that's you because you should be at Encore than. Lol.... A couple of side notes- Carpeting in the rooms and some of the casino, pretty dated and needs replacing.
This is my 1st time staying here and it is such a gorgeous place! I had a suite and the view was breathtaking. It was directly across from Wynn and overlooking the golf course!  . I did ordered room service and the food was disappointing.  The chicken was so salty! Overall the staff was great! I will be back but I'm going to cut out the late night room service.
