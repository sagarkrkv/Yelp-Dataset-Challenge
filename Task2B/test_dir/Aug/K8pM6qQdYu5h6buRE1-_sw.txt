I've heard that Lo-Lo's was the best chicken and waffles around and this place totally lived up to all the talk. Waited to get seated for 40 minutes but it was worth the wait. They were super busy but the servers were very attentive and friendly. As for the food, the chicken was packed with flavor along with being juicy. I didn't want to stop eating. I would definitely come back.
My first Lolo's experience last night. The place is cute and clean with ample parking in back or nearby. For a Monday night, it was pretty busy with families and two-tops. I was most impressed by the service, everyone was so friendly, ready to offer recommendations and patient when we couldn't pick what to have!  The chicken is wonderful, whether in a salad or off the bone, fries were good and the cornbread was sweet and tasty.   Portions are big, I spent a lot of time goggling at what others had ordered and wondering if they would finish it all.  Very nice experience, will come back again.
Place is good, but could be better. It looks as if a corporation has taken over with their recent expansion and remodeling, including an opening at sky harbor.  The wait is crazy now, and the side dish portions have shrunken in size but not price. $3.50 for a half cup of green beans and $4.00 for one skinny waffle seems a bit much, but hey, people are coming in droves and paying, so I guess the price is right until a competitor steps up.
I came in here on a friday night late. There was a few people eating and they had a DJ. This was my second time here. I ordered the 3 piece chicken and two sides, cornbread for $14, and paid $2 to upgrade to two chicken breasts. I placed my order and was excited to have some good fried chicken. The waitress left and 3 mins later she set my meal on the table. This did not make me happy, I wanted to wait, 10, 20, even up to 30 mins for my fried chicken. Not 3 mins, because I knew the chicken would not be fresh out of the fryer, and it wasn't. It was old, not juicy, and almost cold. I was like Im never coming back to this place. I ate the entire meal, because I was paying $16 dollars for it. The side items, collard greens and Mac and cheese were very good. The cornbread was excellent. The manager walked by me several times, but never asked how my meal was. . . So I paid my $24, with tax and tip and Grape Kool aid and left, never to return. Lo Lo's you can't charge $16 for chicken that has been sitting around and expect your customers to come back.
Ok.. So I had to call one of my African American friends and ask him "What the HELL is so goddam special about Lo-Los?!!" To which he Literally laughed out loud and said "NOTHING!!". . I knew he would have been and have some type of input. He had, and he did. No! I am not racist or stereotyping anyone! I know he loves Fried chicken and would give me an honest opinion.  He and I both unanimously decided that this place SUCKS. He told me "you should have called me from the parking lot, I would have saved you a bunch of time and aggravation." . . This is definitely one of those cases in which you should NEVER believe the hype.  . . Over priced. $3 for KOOL AID! (Anybody that orders Kool aid for $3... I have some real estate I want to discuss with you) $16 for dry flavorless chicken and cinnamon waffles. Gimme a break. I can get an entire family meal of chicken at KFC for less than that! And the KFC actually is juicy and has flavor!. . The fried chicken is flavorless. Seriously. Its like flour and a dash of salt. Thats it. NO seasonings at all. They talk about passing down recipes for generations and generation...? WHaaaaaa?  I wonder if while the recipe was being passed down, they deleted the spices to save money on the overpriced food they are selling to us bamboozled people out there... It honestly tastes like fried chicken from a Lubys cafeteria thats specifically cooked to cater to the older folks on restricted diets. . . The waffles were yummy. I will give em that. Cornbread was dry. . . It took over 30 minutes to get a burger. The rest of the meal came out in parts. They forgot some of it altogether till we asked for it. . . This place sucks. Seriously. Its much to do about NOTHING. . . I recommend a name change. Lo-Lo's Hi-Hi. Low low quality and high high prices.
First attempt to eat at LoLo's (on a Sat afternoon) was a fail.  Groups of peops were waiting outside, and because I don't like standing around looking hopeful we left and made another date -. . - this time during the week.  There was no line, but the place was still full!  We asked for a booth and within 5-7 mins one was cleaned off then we were seated.  I immediately liked the high ceiling and covered patio with some cushioned seating.  They really want you to settle in while enjoying your meal.. . I also noticed there were many employees.  At one time we counted six on the floor.  I don't know how many more were in the kitchen. They all seemed quite friendly and I didn't see any bad attitudes in the young staff (a sign of good training and employee ethics).  . . The food was not incredible.  I might have a different review if I liked chicken and waffles, but I don't so I opted for the salmon croquette.  On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being fabulous, I'll give the salmon croquette a 3.  Sorry, but all I tasted was egg.  There was hardly any salmon and I won't be ordering that again.  Ever..   . For veggies, the greens were delicious.  We ordered seconds.  They were not overcooked and had no meat flavoring. A+ The sweet potatoes were wonderful too.. . I wasn't a fan of the cornbread muffin, it was too much flour and not enough corn.  For some folks though, that's how they like their cornbread.  If you're watching your cholesterol, though, better tell them to hold the butter or else you'll end up with a whopping scoop of the yellow stuff right on top.. . Despite having said all this, I'm glad to hear of LoLo's expansion.  It could easily be like any other food chain that americans eat at everyday.  Go 'head wit'cha bad self, LoLo's, get your american dream!
Awesome place to eat. Great food and a friendly environment. Some of the best fried chicken I've ever eaten.
I've ate at both locations, the food is usually good, some times they are bit off and the chicken seems tough. Red Velvet cake is great, sweet tea is just like down south, and the waffles are delicious!. . Both locations are always crowded so get there early and come hungry!
Third times a Charm- This was the third time I attempted to try Lo Lo's. The first two times: It was before the new building and  was located in a tiny house with a Long  line and no parking. Second, pretty much the same story..  Today- Finally made it in. Ill start with this. Valet parking only. It's free ( But you have to tip, so not really free).    Always a wait- we went before lunch but after breakfast so the wait was only 10 mins. I've been to Roscoe's in Long Beach so I really didn't have a burning desire to wait that long. There are tons of restaurants in Phx- IMO I have never eaten at one that was worth a huge long time wait. .    The staff was friendly. Waiter very nice. We had already looked at the menu online so we were ready to order. Food took awhile but they were busy so we expected as much, no problem.. I ordered the chicken tenders with two sides- dirty rice and fries. Dirty rice wasn't on the menu anymore but I asked and they had it. Delish.. My hubby ordered KK. We both liked everything we ordered. I feel they are a little pricey, but not overly. And everything tasted good so we would consider going back in the future.. If my husband was writing this he would give 5 stars- he loved everything about LoLo's.
Again...I'm leaving beyond satisfied...I just love the expertise in this place. Our waiter, Jaqwan, was amazing....Aahhhhhhhhh....
Love Love Love this place! Food and service is always A1. My only complaint is the KoolAid is way OVERPRICED!!!!
We don't have roscoes c&w in phoenix.  We have lolos which even has a location at sky harbor. It is impossible to please everyone. So dont expect excellent customer service there are waaay too many people packed up in here Lol. Most importantly it is worth the wait for great food.
Everything was DELICIOUS!! Employes are all soo nice! Very enjoyable place to eat and cool building.
For a 1st timer I wanted to be honest but I hope to return to a better experience.. Parking was tight. It was raining & waiting area was small & in the way of receptionist desk. We were told to move aside but there was nowhere to move. Wait staff were energetic & friendly. Very helpful with chosen the right meal! Lemonade was delish! Next time I will try it mixed with Koolade. Wait was ok for lunch time. One of 3 plates came & we were told tables were put in wrong order so other 2 plates would take a few min. Chicken wasn't too flavorful but was perfectly cooked & juicy! Tasted great with the ranch. Waffle was tasty & crispy but soft inside! Food was hot. Plate was more than enough. Atmosphere was well spaced & not too busy on walls which I like. Will return! If not for mix up of tables & awkward wait area would've gotten 4 stars.
Love this place.  Always have a good meal.   I always get the Betty boop with a side of cheesy grits.  This is the only place that I will eat the grits.  My only complaint is that they close at 4pm on Sunday.
OMG!!! I arrived in Arizona after a 5 hour flight from Washington, DC and my family took me to Lo-Lo's.  The food was excellent and the Kool-aid ON POINT!!! Our waitress had a great personality and the atmosphere in the restaurant was just great.  I definitely want to go here again before I leave to head back east!!! #MOSTGO
Fist and last time LoLo's will get another dime of my hard earned money !! The food was good (I'll give them that-1 star) and our waiter "Carlos" did his absolute best to improve our experience (2nd star). . The problem with this establishment is the Management: If that's what you call standing around in the parking lot talking to people and doing absolutely nothing to help your staff on a busy Saturday night. This gentleman must be related to someone because a Manger he is not !! What I was even more surprised  to find was that when I went through a few more reviews that most of the negative comments were regarding the Manager and to date nothing seems like it has changed !!So here was my 1st experience:. 1). No reservations, there were 6 of us (45 min. wait).. 2). Oder taken within 15-20 min.. 3). Food took another 30 min to come and came out one plate @ a time (one plate came out, then 10 min. later another and so on) until they got to the last plate which took another 30 min to come out ( I like to Yelp, good and bad so yes I was looking @ the clock: In disbelief and to give an accurate review). So at this point we have been there almost 3 hours and keep in mind the orders were pretty basic: Fried Chicken, greens, mac & cheese, Fried Catfish, green beans and yams (most of what should be already in a pot-the only thing you need to do is season and fry the meat).. 4). We asked for a Manager, no manager came -twice.. 5). A server's chicken flew off the plate onto the floor, no Manager (next to us).. 6). A server was cleaning off a table and dropped the plates, no Manger (next to us). 7) We finally stopped a bald gentleman with gold wire framed glasses who said he was the Manger (because the one we requested never came). We relayed our experience and the fact that by this time our guest was so upset that her food had taken so long (the last plate) that she couldn't even eat it. The Manager's response "This is not the way we do business but we don't comp meals" no eye contact but he repeated it twice like from memory (did I mention our bill was over $100.00). The Chicken dinner was $14 and It was not about the money it was about the Customer Service (but a trained and educated Manager would have known this) !. 8). In comes Carlos (the Waiter), who we let know it was obvious he had no Management support and we knew he was doing his best. Again he was apologetic and sincere and even took $7 off of the bill (it was still over $100 for Fried Chicken and Cat Fish).. ***So if you want to wait along time to be seated and even longer for your food, be ignored by Management (who could care less if you have a good experience or not) and pay over $100 for some pretty good chicken and fish - This is the place for you !!. . Otherwise spend your money somewhere else where they "Thank you for coming" !
Great food wait times can get long. You can not call ahead and all of your party must be present before they seat you. The good is worth the wait time and the waitresses are awesome!
I was disappointed by the lack of customer service at Lo Los.  Me and a friend waited like 15 minutes to be seated which wasn't bad. 10 minutes after being seated we were told by the waitress that she would be right with us. 5 minutes later she comes to take our drink order. 10 minutes later we order our food. 10-15 minutes after the waitress comes to say there are no greens which totally messed up the whole meal. We ask for the manager. Carlos comes over and says it would be 15 minutes for greens and there won't be a problem.  Carlos then comes right back and says it will be an hour for greens. No apology no type of compensation for the huge issue. So we suggest a complimentary margarita in the meantime and Carlos looks at us crazy and says "on the house" like it was an unimaginable request.  After he dismisses the suggestion he  tries to sweet talk us into string beans. We agree. 25 minutes later we notice two tables seated AFTER us and one has greens. We then call Carlos over and tell him what we have recognized and he argues with us saying we haven't been there an hour because the waitress put the order in 25 minutes ago and it was placed after the two tables that arrived after us. Needless to say they lost two customers today.
I got the DD...was too much food for me. Should havejust gotten the Betty Boop. The waffle was amazing and the best part of my meal. Sad to say but my chicken breast was really dry (one star lost). I didn't like it at all. Frys food store has more juicy and flavorful fried chicken. I would go back but only to have the waffle and maybe try some other items and hope for better service. I also didn't like how loud the music was. I couldn't hear the people in my party and we were shouting trying to talk to each other (second star lost). It did give me a headache. I also felt the metal chairs were uncomfortable so I stole a regular wood one from the table next over. Lastly, the service wasn't very great. Always trying to find someone to get a refill for us and when they did it would take 10+ minutes (3rd star lost).
Lo-Lo's in Scottsdale:  Wasn't happy with my first experience of Lo-Lo's.  The service was ok, chicken was dry, and grits were a congealed mass.  All of my food was luke-warm.  I'm not sure if I'll give them a second chance.
I love this place but hate thier hostesses. The stupid rule about seating complete parties is taken too far. I tried to explain that we might have a 3rd person show up but was unsure if they could make it. I had to either choose a table for 2 and if the other showed up they could not join us or get a table for 3 and wait for that person.
In search of authentic chicken and waffles I stumble upon LoLo's. The waffles were outstanding, the chicken was amazing and my two friends and I hardly spoke a word as we devoured each bite. The place was clean and the service was warm and friendly. Do yourself a favor and check it out. I know I will again.
Best fried chicken best everything is consistent and hot and fresh ! Love the okra sweet tea kool aid candy sweets  Mac and cheese so yummy
This is one of the best chicken and waffles place that I've had (comparison to Gladys Knight's Chicken and Waffles in Atlanta and Rosco's in Los Angeles, only beaten out by a hole in the wall that I had in Atlanta).      Chicken had a great crust, moist but not dry.   Waffles were excellent.    Sides was the downer if I could pick out something.   I had the cornbread and it was a bit dry for me (I like the moist, honey version) and the greens weren't that spicy.    All of these were very, very minor the excellent food and service I had.   Top 2 Chicken and Waffles places I've had in the world. . . Famous for: Chicken and Waffles
Loved the Food! Chicken was very tasty, waffles tasted delicious and Catfish was the best.
