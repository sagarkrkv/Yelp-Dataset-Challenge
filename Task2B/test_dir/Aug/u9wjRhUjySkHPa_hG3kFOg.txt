Stated here once awhile back and the hotel itself is very nice. But the sheets had a blood stain on them that looked like dried up period blood. When calling the front desk they offered 120 bucks back on a room that cost 500. Yea I'll never stay here again!
It's still the best hotel in Las Vegas.  Maintenance and service are superb.  The normal rooms are plenty spacious and paying 3X as much for a suite is a waste, unless you enjoy spending the cash.  Like other places they have gotten cheap on the amenities, and put out enough shampoo for a mouse.  They will also sock you $25 if you put your own soda in the refrigerator.  They also hit you for a "resort fee" that covers the Internet and isn't listed as part of the price  We have been staying there since it opened and never been comped for anything.  Still, it's the best.
The Wynn is a classy yet fun hotel. It has an awesome pool for the kids, and great rooms! I also saw Kevin Durant there
I'm sharing a secret with you. This is my favorite hotel to stay and play in Vegas...and if you keep an eye on the rates, you might even score a night's stay at a decent price! Everything here is top of the line. From the scent in the air and the beauty of the design, to the cleanliness of the grounds and the friendliness of the staff, everything is an A+ experience. After all, any resort that perfects the floral world to the point of creating a mechanical carousal made entirely out of flowers deserves five stars in my book.. . The restaurants:. . Vegas is like Disneyland for adults and staying here is like staying at the Disneyland Hotel. The restaurants are culinary masterpieces with award winning chefs. There are almost too many restaurants to choose from, but I've enjoyed dining at SW Steakhouse, Lakeside, The Buffet, the grill in the sports book, the cafe and room service. I used to love getting a coffee and pastry at the chocolate cafe overlooking the waterfall, but during my last stay I was saddened to see that it had been replaced with a retail shop. Not only is the food excellent at the Wynn, but the ambiance is top notch as well. . . The shopping: . . Wallets be warned, shopping here could break the bank! However, it's pretty to enjoy while window shopping! They have many high end retailers in the Wynn, including Louis Vuitton, a Rolex store, Monolo Blahnik, Oscar De La Renta and the list goes on and on. The shops are gorgeous and the merchandise inside is even more gorgeous. And yes, they even have a Ferrari store inside the Wynn so if you hit the jackpot, you could drive away in your brand new Ferrari. Here's to dreaming big.. . The Casino: . . The table minimums never seem to go lower than $15 but then again, it's the Wynn. However, they do have rows and rows of gambling for all types of gamblers. You can even play the card game War!  The sports book is huge and filled with comfortable seating and plenty of tvs.. . The Hotel . . I just love the hotel. Where do I begin. First of all, the security here is great. You can't enter the elevator area without presenting your key and they will only provide a guest room with two keys, so you won't be finding people cramming into one room here. The rooms are spacious, airy and delightful. The windows go from floor to ceiling and the blinds are mechanical so you can open and close as you wish without leaving your bed. They even have a tv in the bathroom!. . The amenities will spoil you rotten. The pools look like they should be Roman baths and the cabanas are like outdoor resort rooms complete with couches, tvs and refrigerators. The Wynn pools combine with the Encore pools, so it creates this ongoing view of never-ending pools. They have an outdoor bar with video casino games so you can enjoy the best of both worlds. . . Parking is free which is good enough for me!. . Encore and Wynn are connected so if you can't stay at the Wynn and stay at the Encore, you can still enjoy the benefits of both. . . If you get the opportunity to stay at the Wynn, take it and don't be surprised if you never again want to stay anywhere else!
Actually I give it 3 and a half stars. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and huge. There's a Ferrari dealership, a huge casino, a big buffet. We paid almost $1000 for a panoramic view suit. My friends paid half that at the Trump hotel and got such a better view. It's a really fancy hotel though with really nice employees. It's also pretty far from the center strip where most of the action is. The club was awesome and I saw the entire team USA there. I also saw Tyrese Gibson. They were all staying at the Wynn. That should tell you something about how fancy this place is. The worst part though, the buffet was horrible. I was like a kid in the candy store when I first saw their brunch. Everything looked so good but looks can be deceiving. I couldn't even finish 1 plate. It gave me a horrible stomach ache and everything was pretty bland. I was so disappointed in the buffet especially.
This is my fav place to visit in las Vegas. The customer service is always outstanding. Its such a nice hotel and casino the fashion show mall is connected to it by bridge which makes shopping so much easier and fun. I always have the time of my life here
The Wynn, arghh, I'm torn between the fact that this is one of the top 3 resorts in Vegas out of the 12 I've been too for ascetics, food, comfort etc., but the freakin Night Club that is right outside most of the suites runs until 4 in the morning with a DJ and speakers outside! Okay I like to dance but not when I'm trying to sleep. Hear is where it gets worse.After the first night I asked to move and was told there was no where to move that was more quiet and we had to just bare it. Are you kidding me! We've travel to 4-5 star resorts around the world. Typically resorts get rating that high because the value the experience of their customers. Not the Wynn! They are throwing a party and if you do not like it (or want to sleep before 4am), then you are forced to leave the hotel- which is ridiculous. . Now you might be thinking I might be a lame person, but when I stated I was unhappy at the front desk I realized I was next to someone with the same complaint. FYI I am 32 and like to have a good time the guy next  to me was within a few years of me. I looked at him and said, "difficult night?" He said that he left a club at 1am sick and when he got back to his room at the Wynn the music was so loud in his room he felt like he was in the club and got no sleep. . How many people even fit in that club. They are catering to a few hundred guests , keeping many more up to 4am with a nightly club. Simply ridiculous! I'd stay at A number of resort before this one.
I tossed and turned all night in my room due to the LOUD, LOUD, LOUD music. If not for that, I would give this place a five star rating. The rooms kick luxury up a couple notches to just delightful. The restaurants are all terrific. The shops are wonderful. But after a terrific night you go to your room and all you hear is thump, thump, thump, thump... and when you call downstairs they say, sorry, it will be that way until 4AM. At 2AM I asked for a fan, which came at 3AM (at that point I was so pissed I just took it and didn't tip the person). Really a shame - such a beautiful location, but if you want to go to sleep before 4AM they don't want you here.
Imagine a place where everything, every little detail, has been design to make you happy. That's how it feels to stay at the Wynn Hotel in Vegas. The service is amazing, all the restaurants are incredible. The cassino floor is the best cassino in Vegas, the only cassino you don't smell cigarette (it's allowed to smoke inside the cassinos but somehow you can't smell it!). Everything is extremely clean and very well organized. Im OCD and I appreciate that. . It comes with a cost, it's not cheap to stay at the Wynn but it is worth spending the extra money to stay in a place where you know you will not have any issues. . . The nightclubs are good, just like any nightclub in vegas, its a DB Heaven but other than that, it's a lot of fun all the time.. . If you stay at the Wynn Vegas, I recommend you to see the show Le Reve (at the Wynn Theater), its AMAZING!
The Wynn is pretty but her sister hotel, Encore is way more beautiful from their rooms to their casinos and restaurants.  The Wynn needs to change their towels. They're no longer soft.. . We have reservations to one of their fine dining restaurants one evening. I asked the concierge if she could help me get a waterside table for dinner.  She just said there is no guarantee and to just talk to the receptionist at the time we get to the restaurant to make a request.  She also said that it "will not help if i'm nice" to the receptionist. I thought that was a weird thing to say. In other words, the concierge was useless.  She did not even make an attempt to help me or make a call or something.. . I will not go back to Wynn Hotel.
This hotel does not honor your reservation and they will do nothing to make amends or give you the requested room.  . We booked a double non-smoking and they gave us a smoking double room.  I had to request a change 4 times.  Read the reviews on tripadvisor and book a different hotel.
It has special memories for me because I worked there and the beauty of it hasn't faded, it's as beautiful as it was when it first opened. The experience begins the moment you walk in with all the aromas of the fresh flowers from the valet area, it's very unique & special. If you visit this place please do not miss The Lake of Dreams which is a hidden spot that a lot of visitors miss. . The property is beautiful...
I had a great experience at this hotel.  Vegas is crazy, but this hotel actually remains relatively calm.  The flowers are gorgeous and add to the peaceful ambiance.  Our room was beautiful and I loved all the buttons features.  For example, upon entering you press a button to open drapes...it sounds silly but it's so cool!  Then the beautiful view of the strip laid before us.. . The pool, although clean and serene, was nothing spectacular and I was a little annoyed how long it took to get waited on for a drink (I ended up just going to the bar myself), but at the same time the "calm" pool was adequately separated from the more "party" pool at the other end which I appreciated.. . Gym facilities were also very spacious with plenty of machines, water, and fruit.. . I also really loved "The Buffet", one of my new favorites of Vegas.  Tons of delicious seafood and asian pieces.  My favorite was the pancake bar!  Definitely make sure you try some with the strawberry sauce and fresh cream.. . For those who want a more calming experience with less crazy people and willing to spend more, stay here.  I personally would stay at a place with a little more to do and less pricey like the Venetian or Caesars Palace, but I can't complain.
I had a girlfriend come to visit and she stayed at the Wynn last night.  She invited me over for a visit and we had the best service!  The bars and casino area are extremely clean and beautifully decorated with the nicest staff!  . . Later that night we went up to her room to chat and she was locked out.  Her key card did not work so she called for help from the house phone.  A very young, very accommodating, night manager came to the rescue within minutes.   We did not have to wait outside of the room for long.  I was surprised that a young manager cared so much to help out himself instead of sending someone who may have taken longer to let us into the room.  I'd say this hotel is the best in Las Vegas with the nicest staff from A-Z!
Literally the first time I have ever felt compelled to post a review on yelp. After booking a reservation for six nights here we arrived to have our room not be available and dates of stay inaccurate. This all lead to waiting in line and speaking to half a dozen individuals only to end up waiting 4 hours in order to finally have our rooms available. However now the system was down and so the room we had requested was not available and we could not get a set of keys for our room. Upon receiving our said temporary key, we finally arrived at our room only to have the key unusable. Now 6 hours after our checkin and speaking to several people with no compensation or real acknowledgement from staff, we finally get to our room exhausted... The only reason why they get two stars is because it is a beautiful hotel and everyone we have spoken to have said how great this place was an how great the staff is. I have to believe that this was a fluke however it leaves a really bad impression and a massive inconvenience to a couple booking our a suite for nearly a week. How can you be a five star hotel and treat people like this and have such poor customer service
Unfortunately the staff did not handle the fact that 2 people in our party got sick from the tuna salad sandwich from the deli properly. Its a shame that such a hotel doesn't care to step up when things go wrong. I would never eat or stay at this hotel again.
They get one star for having a beautiful casino. Outside of that I would never come here to gamble again. The rooms are great but the service on the casino floor has to be the worst on the strip. The machines don't pay and they crash a lot. I have come here three times over a 5 year span and every time there has been an issue and they did a poor job of taking care of the guest. This third chance is the last they will get from me
Its the most beautiful hotel I've ever been in, but you really gotta be a millionaire here. I was dying for a shnakey vodka redbull , but felt very working class, so ended up ordering a champagne mojito or some shite like that. I also tried to pretend I knew a thing or two about whiskey, but 7 grand a bottle really put me in my place. I think I'll just stick to the cheap shit they sell in the wallgreens next door.
I love the Wynn.  I am a local and visit the Wynn at least 1x per week... I win at the Wynn!
Business trip to Cali decided to step away and have a small family reunion, and what more better than a couple days in Vegas! Decided to stay at the Wynn hotel and got an upgraded suite. The room was awesome, enough to consider replicating the design and building a new house kind of awesome! The view was great, I think almost all all the rooms overshadow the golf course which is pretty in itself. The pool looked descent although I didn't have a chance to get in, decided to prowl all the other hotels around being that this would be the first trip of many to come. Casino has a nice Vegas feel. The clubs inside such as XS were sought but during the weekends lines are crazy so wasn't enough reason to go out of my way. Food was good not anything amazing but good. Overall had a good experience hoping for an opportunity to come back. O.... And bring a lot of money!
Wynn is one of the most beautifully decorated casinos as far the interior goes. All the bright colorful color theme inside truly gives you such a happy mood. Le Reve is known for the best award winning Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas. It's truly Amazing fascinating.
We stayed here over the weekend and we must say, we were very disappointed. The hotel room was nice-nothing special though. The casino itself was small and the ceilings were very low. The machines were high priced and paid out NOTHING. The poker room had limited games and if your someone who likes limit, then your out of luck here. . The location of The Wynn also blows. Its next to nothing fun and a big walk to the middle of the strip. . Oh, and I almost forgot the food/restaurants here also suck. They are all over priced and the food we did have was not even good. Not a good sports bar or dessert shop or nothing. The shops were all empty and super high end. Why bother when NO ONE is in your store. A bunch of empty restaurants and shops. LAME!. We gave it 2 stars only because it obviously wasn't ghetto.
Our first time stay for our wedding anniversary celebration sucked!!!  First,no body lotion in the room and we called the house keeping still no lotion!  We had to go ask for one in person that was already cleaning the other room.  We asked nicely and he said bad word in Spanish and gave us upset look!  . Second, had super salty dinner at the buffet!  Especially prime rib and crab legs I had to spit it out!  . Third, meat head valet guy try to bully my husband because he did not tip when we drop off the car.. Fourth, they never asked us how was our stay during the check out!
This review is more of a 2.5 than a three.. . After 3 nights in the Wynn and another 2 to go I've already formed an opinion. It "feels" like the Wynn is simply less refined than the Encore and perhaps that's due to the fact that the Encore was built after the Wynn.. . The check in process isn't as smooth, the lines just didn't seem to move quickly then when you get to the front it took an age to be processed. This could have been a one off as I don't recall having that problem at the Encore.. . The first thing I noticed was that the Wynn rooms feel a little dated and of course the Strip view isn't as good. One annoying thing is that there are no power outlets near the bed, only near the desk area which is on the other side of the room. The soundproofing of the rooms isn't fantastic - I had one couple arguing on one side and another person playing Rhianna loudly on the other. On this occasion the music from the nightclubs was clearly audible too.. . I called housekeeping at 11.30am to get them to make up my room, when I returned at 2.30pm it was still a mess. I rang down again and asked why it hadn't been cleaned and they said that I have to asked them to rush the housekeeping if I want it cleaned faster than the normal service allows. In every other luxury hotel I've stayed a call to housekeeping normally results in your room being cleaned pretty much there and then.. . I found the Wifi to be a little unpredictable which was disappointing. I also found that AT&T and T-Mobile coverage to be patchy too whilst in the room and the hotel in general.. . My last note is about the groups of hookers that hunt in packs on the casino floor. Each to their own but it's a little off putting getting hit on by some very shady characters quite so many times in the space of the walk from the lobby to the elevators. This is obviously a part of life in a big leisure and convention destination like Vegas but I was surprised at the number of them and how blatant and brazen they were - even near the myriad of security personnel. It gave the hotel a very down market feel.. . I really wanted to enjoy the Wynn but unfortunately I didn't.
Reviewing Tower Suites. Spontaneous decision to spend the weekend in LV had me phoning the Wynn casino marketing to see if I could get a room comped for the weekend. Luckily, I was able to secure a complimentary room based on play from last visit (two nights would have been $800+). We checked in right around midnight on Friday, there was no line so it was pretty easy process. One note, I realize it was very late but front desk clerk was not friendly and actually our reception was borderline icy and not what I am accustomed to at Wynn properties. We were given room 56-62. I would not recommend it and here's why:. 1. Dated decor. Mr Wynn, it's time to fire your designer. This room looks like my grandmothers high end condo. Cream colored, tufted leather sofa, cream plaid carpeting yuck! They've tried to modernize with art and some furniture but it doesn't work. . 2. Noisy. Really noisy! Club music until 4am and starts back up at 10am at the club at the pool. While I don't come to Vegas for R&R, i do hope to get SOME sleep (thank goodness I didn't pay for this room!!!). 3. There are no usable outlets near the bed. Major inconvenience if your phone needs juice and just plain unacceptable for a hotel of this caliber. . 4. Elevators to suites are small and hot (yes, I'm knit-picking). . 5. Entire sections missing from the resort guide book. Had to call front desk/concierge to find restaurants that we're open late etc. . 6. Not related to the room, but the Wynn is seriously lacking a 24/7 casual restaurant (think Grand Lux). At 1:30am our options were Allegro, a mid level Italian eatery or counter service at The Cafe. We chose Allegro and ended up eating undercooked pasta and paid $6 for bread basket...at an Italian restaurant. Really???? I'm not even going to go into how bad the service was. . . A positive note...nice bathroom toiletries and my husband loved the bed. . . I will never stay at the Wynn again. The Encore is a different story but that's another review. I think I'll be back at Venetian next visit.
