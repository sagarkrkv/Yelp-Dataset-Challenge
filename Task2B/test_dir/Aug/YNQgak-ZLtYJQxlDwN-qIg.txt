Came here for Sunday Brunch (which cost about $50/person with taxes, etc) with some friends who were visiting from out of town.  Food was very good. Meat highlights included this yummy pepper crusted bacon and lamb. Also, lots of fruit options, lots of desserts (I was so stuffed, but my one regret of the morning was not getting to have a crepe! darn!)  with gelato & cookies & cakes & cinnamon bread pudding thingy...oh my! We had expected some lobster, but the only lobster was baked into a frittata was was mediocre. Also, no crab legs in the am. But overall, it was worth it, especially since I was post overnight call and starving and ate like 7 plates of food. Pastas were surprisingly good. The way they get you is in the lines waiting on made-to-order eggs.  Oh, they also had really yummy congee! . . There is, obvi, a 2 hour time limit, which you do not need. Unlimited coffee/tea/orange juice. Service was quite good.
Amazing value for the money! Get every station, great variety, food was really tasty and the desert station wrapped wrapped all the way around!
What is a trip to Las Vegas without going to a buffet? When we arrived at 7pm there wasn't a link to get in, but it did take a while to get seated after we paid.. . We started off with Oysters on the half shell which we had to spit out because they were rotten & very gritty. The Veal short ribs were very tender but did not have a lot of flavor. My favorite food at the buffet is the Prime rib. The portion was very generous but there wasn't a lot of beef flavor & the knife we had wasn't sharp enough to cut through the meat with ease. We had a ton of desserts which were not bad, especially the Tiramisu & the Lemongrass tart. What we did not like were the Candied apple, the Profiteroles, & the Creme brulee. The apple was must & was starting to rot; the pastry dough was way too dense; & the custard was too liquid'y.. . To make the $39.99 price tag worthwhile, we stuff ourselves...perhaps a little too much...& it wasn't all that worth it.
I was told that this was the place to go for a buffet. I'm not a buff a girl and I usually don't I eat at buffet based on the fact that you just don't know how long the food been out. Plus its not that big of a deal to me anymore. The buffet started at $35.99. I always order what I want and enjoy my meal thoroughly. However there was something special about the buffet at the Wynn.. . They had over 8 different stations for different varieties of food. I started at the sushi station where I had a deal which is one of my favorite things. I was happy to see that the sushi chef there was very attentive to any rules or any particular item that wasn't on the menu that he could make for me. Impressive. I've been went to the carving station where I had prime rib that was juicy and flavorful even before I reach for the horseradish! They also had slab bacon in your choice of Apple or hickory smoke. I thought that was very interesting who would have thought you could have it homestyle. pier.. . I enjoyed the pancake station were you had three varieties of pancakes to choose from - butter milk ,Blue corn and another variation that I cannot remember. But what I do remember best is the type of butter that I could choose. For my pancakes I had the apple butter with traditional whipped butter. It was so tasty.. . The seafood station was very good from peel and eat shrimp to crab legs all of the seafood staples were near. You can never get enough fresh crab. I finish up my meal with a dessert from the dessert bar fresh gelato homemade cookies. It's enough to make you go mad. I greatly appreciated the pastry chef that was diligently making the sugary dessert as we ate.. My meal was accompanied by my endless mimosa which was an additional $15.. .  What I was most impressed about this buffet, is that every station performed excellent presentation. The execution of all of the issues was well thought out and well planned. Everything was hot everything was fresh everything was in order. Everything you ate tasted like a $50 meal
Me and my boyfriend came here for lunch on Friday and I had a lot of expectations for this  buffet because of yelp. It started out great. We went on a great time where a lot of people are already leaving so we got seated within 15 minutes. . . The food choices seems huge but with a closer look, it was just mediocre. Some were a hit and miss. I guess they don't serve crab legs during lunch. Basically, no shell fishes during lunch. They only had 3 choices for sushi. We got 2 slices of the steak and it kinda lacks flavor. The Italian section is where all the good foods were. The breaded eggplant was amazing. They also had salmon, red snapper, and mahi mahi and those were delicious. . . Now service kinda sucked. We were almost done with one plate and the server just kept passing us by. Then she was gone for a couple of minutes and the busser was the one who asked us if we've been helped and he's the one who got our drinks for us after he noticed that we were trying to look for her. Thanks jerry!! Perfect timing, right when jerry came with the drinks, that's when she showed up. Lol. For the rest of the time we were there, whenever we needed her, we had to hunt her down.
Best buffet prime rib on the strip, bar none!!. . I had a Coke at the end because I was told that their fountains are calibrated everyday by someone from Coca-Cola.  Even THAT was delicious!.  . I will have to say, however, that their prime rib was delectable!  Roasted to perfection, the right amount of salt and spices (I think it was also brined).  Tender and juicy and seemed to melt in your mouth.  I can't say enough about it.. . Well worth the $$ at a Vegas buffet.  . . Best advice is to go earlier than you plan because it could have a line.
This review is for Friday night dinner. $41/person. I was super excited for this buffet prior to going - I've eaten at Caesar's and Cosmo both multiple times and many other buffets and some people say this is the best!  I was really disappointed.. . First - we had skipped lunch, so my boyfriend and I were unbelievably hungry which should have put the ball in wynns court. Still didn't do it.. . The salads were great - the best part of the buffet. Loved the Greek salad and the roasted chickpeas.. The sushi was average - nothing exciting. The Chinese was really quite poor. The duck dumpling station was closed and the other concoctions were chewy and tasteless.. The prime rib was great. Best anywhere. The rest of the meat was only average and the pastas were dry. The thing that put me over the edge was that the seafood was absolutely terrible. I'm a huge seafood fan - salmon, sea bass I love it all. The salmon was sweet and horribly dry and the choice to put olives over the sea bass.. totally questionable. This was the first time I had ever spat out sea bass. Poor little guy. Makes me want to give them 2 stars.. Finally the desserts were honestly just average. There was one fancy peanut butter chocolate thing that was delicious but everything else tasted like it had been frozen or left out all day.. So minus one star for sea food and another for lack of creativity. 3 stars for the salad and veggie options (great Brussel sprouts!), beautiful decor and having such a variety. I didn't even eat half of the stuff there.. All in all, I won't be returning.
The Buffet, what a perfect name for the obvious.  Haha.  I got there around lunch time and it was $25.  Had to wait in a line but it didn't seem to take forever.  What made it nice was looking into the beautiful atrium room.  I overheard someone say that's for the high rollers, IDK?  But either way it was very pretty to look at.. . Now the buffet.  It was one of the largest I've ever been too.  It was like the length of a Walmart.  International food selections, Asian, Italian, American, Mexican and dessert.  . . I really enjoyed everything except their pizza, so gross!  I made sure to portion out my food so I had enough room for dessert.  Tried their gelato and tiramisu was my favorite dessert.  Interestingly my favorite was making a spring salad.  It tasted so good.  Yes everything else was bomb to eat, but those were my favs.. . Bathrooms, expect a line.  But you get your own private stall with doors covering from floor to ceiling.  Make all the noise you want.  Just run with a blushing cheeks as you face the next person who has to smell your after buffet results.  Get er' done, it's Vegas, and it stays in Vegas Baby!!!!
Was just here for the first time having lived in Vegas for three years I'd definitely say I've been missing out. The food was delicious the variety amazing and the atmosphere was awesome. Great food great place good service I recommend for sure.
I'm not a fan of buffets but every now & then it's fun to go all out & stuff yourself. This buffet is definitely one of the best in town & it always has great fresh selections. . If you know someone there make sure to grab a VIP line pass because the lines are always insanely long. . It's great for big groups of families or friends!
Where to begin...let me preface by saying that I have a long list of severe food allergies and I rarely eat out at restaurants.  I found out about The Buffet when searching for a more upscale dining option (most upscale restaurants are aware of and able to share the ingredients in their food).  I drug my whole family along with me, a total party of 6 and we tried it out.  We waited about 10 minutes total between waiting in the line and paying, before we were seated.  The decor is whimsical and classy, almost like a disney dining experience in new orleans square.  We ate dinner at around 7:30 on a Saturday.  . The food was wonderful and the staff was attentive.  I must send out a special thank you to the assistant executive chef, Trang Tran.  She came out and literallywalked the buffet line with me while we discussed my allergies.  She told me what I could and couldn't eat and even made me some special dishes to accommodate my allergies.  If it wouldn't have been weird, I would have given her a huge hug when I left full and satisfied!  My family had all of the dishes as normally prepared and absolutely loved everything they ate, including the halved crab legs.  The highest rating went to the meatloaf, which everyone ate and loved! I thought that for the cheap prices ($40/person) and the amount of food and level of service received, this buffet will definitely be seeing me again on our next trip!!
It's one of the best buffets in Vegas. I thought that most Buffets are the same, with the same set up, however, this buffet is one the best. Food is so good and the dessert section is not one I have seen in many buffets. This one has gelato and all other types of goodies that must not be missed. Will I return? Of course yes!!
We were there Friday dinner buffet, supposed to be the best in a week.  All we can say is good ambiance and good service - they deserve stars.. . No star for the food!  Prime rib was tough to chew, T-bone steak was not good quality meat, fish dishes were too dry and over cooked, king crab legs were too salty, no sashimi at the Japanese section - in general total disappointment.  We would recommend Bellagio and Paris buffet.  Also heard Caesars Palace buffet is good.  These are better alternatives!
Very good buffet on the strip.  The price was reasonable for a Friday night seafood buffet.  Not the most selections compared to others, but the quality is there.  All the seafood items tasted fresh.  Standout dishes include the crab legs, raw oysters, ahi poke, street tacos, peking duck on a bun, ramen noodles with a very good broth and the desserts.  The service was excellent as can be expected from a Wynn resort.
The food is very yummy. I am usually not a buffet fan for my own fear of sanitation issues but this place was clean.  While I wish I could compare this to other buffets on the strip sadly I cannot but I can say that this place is worth it.  . . We will start with my favorite... dessert.  This place has an amazing selection of miniature desserts I personally tried the warm chocolate chip cookie, tiramisu, red velvet cupcake and banana pudding and all of them were delicious and displayed so beautifully.. . When I went everything was self service but they did have a few live stations were food is made upon request such as the pasta station. Every pasta dish that I tried was tasty but my favorite was the lasagne. At the asian station I enjoyed some sushi which all tasted very fresh.  And at the seafood station I enjoyed the cold crab legs and shrimp. . . This was definitely a memorable experience to go a long with the great service that I recieved.
Pros: . -Entrance decor. -Really tasty meats - get the prime rib and steak. Good crab. I liked that it was flavorful and came with a side of melted butter. I liked it better than Bacchanal's which I had the day before. My friend didnt like that it was served cold but I didn't mind it. . -Really good gelato!!. -Price is not as expensive as other buffets especially if you go right before dinner. ;). . Cons: . -The desserts I had, other than the gelato, were average. Didn't have the creme brulee perhaps I shall try it next time. . -Lacked variety compared to Bacchanal.. -Called in to find the price and was accidently? told the weekday prices and ended up paying more than we anticipated. We ate there anyway but no kind of apology or price adjustment. . . Would I go again? Mmm... I'll probably try somewhere else.
My friends were raving about this place, so I was super excited to go. "The best buffet in Vegas." Perhaps years ago, but "The Buffet" as of 2014 is nothing special. Yes, the decor is eye catching, colorful and elegant. The food presentation is nice and with variety. I was most excited by the dessert section and wanted to try almost everything. The mini desserts in shot glasses were just so adorable! The space is clean and about the right price for a Vegas buffet. So what went wrong?. . Okay, after much anticipation to go to this buffet, we were rejected at the entrance because the guys in our group had on sleeveless shirts. WHAT??!! They ended up purchasing t-shirts. I was slightly turned off and maybe because of the heat and walking all day that I ended up not wanting to go in. But we came all the way here for the buffet. Anyhow, the sign about dress code policy stated something about see through tops for ladies. Honestly, the guys were dressed more modest and most appropriate compared to the gals that were let in wearing crop tops, v neck deeper than the Grand Canyon and super short shorts that they might as well be at a beach. . . Anyway, we came here for the food right? Well all of the fish were over cooked. The lamb and beef were chewy and nothing special in term of preparation. The mussels I had were bland and miles away from those I had in Philly (check out Monk's Cafe). I totally skipped the Chinese food section consisted of egg rolls, fried rice and lo-mein, which I am sure  you can find in Chinese takeout places and probably wouldn't taste the difference. I love pasta so I had to visit the Italian section that was ready to order. It was a choice between alfredo or marinara. Not a fan of the Olive Garden, but in this case I am thinking it would be better there. But I did like the three cheese ravioli though. And that was probably the best thing I ate at the buffet. Also stay super far away from the pizza. So then, I figure they couldn't mess up dessert but again I was disappointed, because the presentation looked so good!!! Even my favorite pistachio gelato was a letdown. If anything I was hoping for some fresh watermelon, simple fruits at least to cleanse my palate. But even that was not met. :(. . Maybe I am picky, but the fact that it is VEGAS. I was expecting more. . . By the way, what's up with the pink suit worn by the hostess? Reminisce of Willy Wonka's much?
I'm Torn on this one.  3.75 Stars OK?. . I've been here...3 times now?  I think its finally adequate to give them a review. . They were probably "THE" buffet back in 2009 or 2010.  Since, then I believe they've regressed a bit.  There's like a million reviews on here so I'll just compare this and bacchanal, cause someone's going to find this useful!. . round 1 : Carvery . Bacchanal: Terrific Leg of Lamb.  OK sausage.  OK Ham.  Tasty (a bit salty) briskey.  Salty pork rib (No BBQ sause) .MissingPrime Rib?. Wynn: Best beef rib.  Juicy prime rib (I waited for a good piece), didn't touch anything else.. winner: wynn. . round 2: seafood. Bacchanal: Amazing selection.  Fresher oysters.  Creative mini dishes.  Spectacular soups.  good support of sauces. Wynn:  lacking in options.  Very good cold king crab legs.  small oysters.  . winner: bacchanal. . round 3: sushi (i know its seafood...). bacchanal: why bother?  5 different rolls and sushi combo?. wynn:  not much better, but they did have a very delicious seaweed salad.. winner: wynn. . round 4: World assortment (so i clumped it up..). bacchanal: pho/udon station, cheese and ham station.  Italian station that served steamed crab (bonus point for seafood).  Wagyu beef sliders ( overrated..).  Good looking chinese food station.  Nice assortment of fruits and salad. . wynn: nice dim sum platter, specialized salad dishes, a lot of italian inspired foods, points for ramen station. . winner: bacchanal.. . round 5: dessert. Bacchanal: gelato, cookies, creme brule, crepe, cakes, creme buffs, candied snacks. wynn: same. winner: tie.  This should have been the wynn's but I think they pulled back some items that used to be there... disappointing.. . Ah crap, I thought I got a winner out of this.  It's 2-2-1.  Well, if i had to spend my next $50 bucks on something... I'll say bacchanal...just because The WYNN told someone in my party over the phone that Dinner was a cheaper price then what we actually paid for.  That totally did not go well over with us.  ARE YOU LISTENING WYNN?!
We went on several buffets in Las Vegas for us this buffet is in the first place .. the food is very varied and delicious taste. . The desserts are magnificent.
Regular good buffet but with high vegas buffet standard, this one I don't deserve a 4 stars, their crab leg taste okay, and other dishes aren't as special .. Can't really remember anything so good that I would want to return again.
We went for breakfast & were not disappointed. Got there when it opened & got a table in the atrium which was nice. Lots of options including desserts, creative breakfast options, cook to order stations & an Asian food area (unexpected, but a nice option). Skip the omelettes & pancakes, you can get those anywhere. Try all the creative options, you won't be disappointed. Skip fruit, bagels, cereal etc. if you want get your money's worth. Save room for desserts! Usually at buffets they aren't very good but look pretty & that wasn't the case here.
We went several times the buffet ( Wynn) Las Vegas, it was good. but today I went again and I was disappointed. At the buffet does not have more variety of food that was, put baskets of bread to fill the empty spaces on the balconies of food. The dessert's court is empty ...I'm sorry for this buffet fall in qualification. I don't recommend to my friends, there is a better one in Las Vegas ..
I was excited to try this buffet in Vegas but boy was I disappointed, the quality of foods is bad.  It's like going to a $9.99 buffet.  I'm used to quality since I've been going to Wicked Spoon for the longest.  All I can say it taste like a cheap buffet and there's nothing I enjoyed.  Avoid at all cost unless they revamp the place.
This review is for the weekend brunch buffet - it gets high marks for presentation but low marks for food.  I always think that for the money the food should be better.  . . It is a really nice looking buffet - the main courtyard atrium is lovely and the dessert room is stunning but I find that most of them don't taste as good as they look.. . There are some really standout items at this buffet - the lox is yummy and plentiful, the super thick cut bacon is fantastic, and the soy gelato (raspberry and mint chip flavors) was outstanding.  The warm mini sticky buns in the desert section next to the bread pudding were great. The fresh squeezed orange juice is fabulous!  My friends really enjoyed the congee but congee isn't my thing so I can't comment on that. . . There are also things that are just ok - the pancake station doesn't actually allow you to put the various options IN the pancakes - just on top. The chocolate chips were good and melted properly but I had my heart set on some blueberry pancakes and they didn't have any fresh blueberries.  The lobster quiche had some nice pieces of lobster but the quiche itself was just kind of Blegh.. . I always look for chocolate croissants (one of my favorite food items on earth) but they have a surprising lack of breakfast bread/ pastry items (considering the giant room of deserts which I think go hand in hand).. . No oysters, no crab legs, the salmon filets were dry as a bone and tremendously over cooked.. . Our waiter wasn't around much but our busboy was very obliging in bringing us more orange juice. If it weren't for him I would have subtracted another star.
Very average.  No King crab legs on Saturday night (despite pics); only cold snow crabs.  Oysters were not good.  Shrimp was not fresh.   Beef ribs were tough.  We had higher hopes.  Casino buffets in NorCal are so much better.  For the price, don't do it.  Plus side - service was great!
We went for the Sunday brunch. We arrived early enough to get in fast. The dress code is strict...no sleeveless shirts.....a mother with her two sons would not be allowed in. The mom was upset...but read the signs......no sleeves, no service.. . The area behind the hostess stand is a brightly sunlike room that is decorated like  a outside garden room.  Not my style, but I am sure some people think it's nice.. . We sat in the room to the left. It was nice and well decorated. Our services was attentive and on top of keeping our drinks topped and our dishes cleared when we would get more. . . The amount of food choices is overwhelming. I love the various egg dishes and omelette bar. The meats were tender and the choices for desserts were fantastic.  . Overall the experience was good, but when I compare this to the bacchanal buffet, the buffet didn't impress me.  Go for the Bacchanal Buffet....you won't be disappointed.
Great food, definitely worth the short wait in line.  Best time to have dinner is get there before 6 PM rush!  Make sure you ask to sit in the Atrium.  . . Pros: Crepes, Cheeses, Crab, Sweet Potato, and the Italian Chicken.  . . Cons: Waiting time can be long if you go at peak time.
This buffet was just "meh" to me. It was $40 per person. It didn't offer as many items as I expected. There wasn't a lot of seafood. There was one chilled seafood section and all they had were crab legs and shrimp cocktail and some tuna seaweed salad. At these prices, I expect oysters and clams as well as I've seen them at buffets that charge much less. . . There was another section that served ramen. We tried the miso ramen. Super disappointing as it was completely tasteless. . . There was an Asian section but it offered like 4-5 items like egg rolls and wonton. Very disappointed at the selection of food there. . . The italian section was a little better as it had chicken, fish, pasta and it was all decent. Next to the italian section was a charcuterie section. There were a variety of cold cuts but no prosciutto. Another disappointment. . . The desserts, like the other sections, lacked variety and even the basics. I was craving a chocolate cake and didn't see one slice of chocolate cake. I think chocolate cake is such a basic staple. Every buffet dessert section should have at least that. They served candied apples, little cupcakes, lots of mousses and most of which were overly sweet. I tried a taste of everything. Their best dessert was their pistachio gelato...it is the only reason why they got a 3-star review from me. . . Save your money and go to the buffet at the M resort. I believe they are called Studio B. Much better selection of food with more variety and flavors.
The Buffet at the Wynn is one of the more expensive plates on the strip.  I guess it's legitimate to ask the question, is it worth it?  After all, isn't it still a buffet?  I would say this, the quality of the ingredients used in its preparation is far higher than say at the Rio or MGM.  That's not to say those are worse than the Wynn since all of this is subjective.  What I will say is the Wynn does offer a level of precision that one expects from a sit down service.. . The one thing The Buffet at the Wynn offers that no other resort can match at this moment is a very good vegan menu.  For vegans out there, the way to eat at The Buffet is to let the server know that you're vegan and what they'll do is in turn inform the Chef who will then come out and walk you through the line.  It's an amazing experience that I believe everyone should experience.  The level of detail the Chef goes into is quite extraordinary.  Unfortunately, I found the food to be a little uneven.  The vegan pizza was definitely subpar in my book.  Perhaps Steve Wynn enjoys his pizza with less cheese, but even as a vegan I expect at least some melted cheese on the dough.  Instead what they had was raw cheese that wasn't melted.  However I did find the artichoke ravioli in a spicy vegan marinara to be quite delicious and flavorful.  The layers of flavors the Chef was able to get out of such a simple item was quite astounding.  The cream if mushroom soup was rather creamy for something missing cream, but what really stood out were the desserts...and more specifically the dark chocolate covered Rice Krispies.  Superb, no way around that.. . With that said I go back to the question is it worth $40?  That really depends on what you're looking for.  If you want to eat $40 worth of food, you're probably going to be sick afterwards, but if you to savor items then I do think this is one of those opportunities to treat yourself.  The only downside is you have to pay extra for drinks.  I think at that price point and for such a high volume resort, drinks should be included in the price, but then what do I know.  I just eat.
After going to the Bacchanal buffet last year, this place just doesn't hold up. . . The transition from lunch to dinner wasn't too well coordinated, so it took some time before everything was switched over. Everyone was obviously hovering waiting for the crab legs to appear, so there was quite a line when those were finally put out. While I did gladly stock up on these, I was really waiting for the lamb chops. Sadly, these never made an appearance. And the meat counter in general was quite lacking. They had a giant ribeye, ribs, prime rib and a rack of lamb. Pretty sad compared to the array of meat Caesars had to offer. . . I haven't especially liked any dessert counter at the buffets I've been to (things always look pretty but don't taste great), and this one was no exception. After taste testing just about everything, the highlights were definitely the warm cookies, gelato, and creme brulee. The biggest disappointment was the crepe with filled with burnt, chunky nutella, with no option of banana as a filling.. . Overall, if you're just looking for the crab legs, this place will do. But if you want a nice selection of meats, then pay a few extra bucks and head over to Caesars.
We arrived around 4:30pm for dinner and there was NO LINE.. . However, because it was a slow non-holiday Tuesday so the food selection was not its best but still fair for its price.. . Due to thenumber of people that was there, many of the food was visibly already dried up on the top but still tasted good.. . If they can improve on the selection, I would have given it a four stars rating.. . The staff was friendly and was quick to respond to requests.
Great food and service!  Yes, it's expensive and there is a long line, but it's all worth it, trust me!  My husband and I came here for dinner on our last night in Vegas.  I had called ahead to ask if they had vegan options because every Wynn restaurant has a vegan menu.  The rep on the phone told me to notify the hostess that I am a vegan, and then a chef will give us a tour.. The hostess, I think her name is Marilyn, was great!  She was so friendly and attentive.  She introduced us to a chef named Annabella, who took us to every station and pointed out which dishes were vegan, and offered to make some food for us as well. . I had the cream of mushroom soup, which was amazing!  She made a pizza, artichoke ravioli with alfredo sauce, a pineapple dessert dish, roasted garlic cauliflower.
Awesome buffet, one of the best I've been to in Vegas. There's always something for everyone. Lines can be long and it can be pricey, but what the heck it's Vegas! The decor is very nice.
Came in for the breakfast. Was much less then dinner breakfast was like 23 bucks. Dinner much more.  The food was soso I was expecting better since this should be a high quality buffet. And we'll it was somewhat but some food was just cold or not very good. The fish they had samon tasted horrible! And I love fish. Everything else was alright just not that good.  I experienced better at the wicked spoon.  . . However the I had dinner and the price was more then 23$ so over all I give 3 starts good was so so but for the price it makes up for that so so.
the simplest food is raised above what you'd expect - subtle flavours in the dried apricot french toast, prime rib cooked to perfection, blintz that are light and fluffy.... . We ate here twice, and they were two of the best meals!  There were a few sub-par items, like on all buffets, but there is so much variety, you can find the gems!
Terrible experience, Elena the manager refused to seat us anywhere near people we know - even though they came in a whole 30 minutes before us unless we pay the 18% mandatory gratuity.  They separated a mom away from her baby because of this rule - it's ridiculous given that there is no line at all on a Friday night.  Terrible customer service.. . Next time do not tell them you know people.
Notes: if possible, go on a weeknight for dinner and do the following:. +Crab Legs (just go and eat your weight in crab legs, it'll be worth the $$)!!!! . +Duck Bun (omg, surprisingly good, and I'm Asian....these duck buns are legit)!!!!!. +Street tacos (wait is long, but not bad for a buffet). +Prime rib :). +Chocolate crepe w/gelato
In general I enjoy coming to the Wynn Buffet and have done so for years.  The crab legs are on point.. Slightly salty but always consistently good.  The prime rib was tender and I believe it to be prime quality as opposed to choice.  The oysters had a mushy mouth feel and not so great body and finish.. Slightly dejected bunch. Overall my dining experience was good, less selection than the ceasars buffet .. Never the less all buffets in my opinion have their strengths and weaknesses.. . The support staff we're very nice and always accommodationg. The nice meal turned a lot less enjoyable when after returning from the restroom a manager questioned weather I was just joining the party and asked to see a receipt.  I produced the receipt and she brushed it off and now changed her story regarding a 2 hour time limit.  The elapsed time was 1 hour and 30 minutes.  I did not take the Wynn establishment to be a fast food joint where conversations during dinner would  impinge on meal time.  I will end with this as I did not get the managers name but it was a she, approximately 5'6 brown hair less than medium build around age 35.
