First time trying Thai food and I'm so mad I've waited this long. The food there was amazing. I was impressed and will go back again. The only complaint I have is about the waiter. It was close to closing time and it seemed as if he was ready to go. Service can have been better especially after I let him know it was my first experience with Thai food!
Did not disappoint.. . My fave is the garlic prawns, crispy and flavored right.. . Liked the preparation of kra pow moo krab but maybe need to review portion size or increase price.. . Other items are ok like sea bass pad see eww and panang curry .. . Coming back if in vicinity.
Great Northern Thai food and wine list that will not disappoint.  We had Garlic Prawns (5*), Sea Bass drunken noodle (4.5*) and crispy duck panang (4.5*) all medium spicy, we like heat, and a Riesling to top it off. If u like Thai food this place is great. Bonus points for the very nice and clean restrooms (Not common in the more authentic asian restaurants)
Forget the service charge I talked about last time. Their food is so damn good I am willing to pay more.. . Amazing food. Service is nice with a smile. Need to book in advance or risk standing in line.
I have had Lotus of Siam on 3 occasions since moving to Las Vegas, 1 in the restaurant and 2 times for take out. . . The food served in the restaurant was a lot better than the experience I had with take out. I ordered the yellow curry and spicy noodles with shrimp for my first take out order. The styrofoam box the noodles were in looked like it had been stepped on, their was sauce all over the bag and it leaked on my counter. After preparing my first plate of food I noticed a black and white hair in my food. My friend and I were disgusted because it looked like an animal hair. I immediately called back Lotus and told them I would be bringing the food back for a refund. When I went into the restaurant I showed them how sloppily they had packaged it and the unknown hair in my food. They said it was probably a hair from one of the girls clothing and I told them it looked like a cat hair. After this they handed me my money and I could see they wanted me out of their restaurant.. . Fast forward a few months later, Lotus is still the closest Thai restaurant to my place and I don't like Komol. I told my friend I wanted to order take out again and she was completely surprised I wanted to give them another chance. I ordered the panang curry with vegetables and asked what vegetables were in the dish. Penny, the owners daughter said carrots, cabbage, and broccoli. I also ordered the Thai spaghetti with chicken. This time my order was packaged correctly but I noticed the panang curry was more oily than usual and contained very little sauce. I also saw that there was baby corn, various peppers, onions, and green beans. Penny described inaccurately what vegetables were in the dish. What if I was allergic? People need to be careful these days and not say things unless they are 100%sure. Both the panang curry and Thai spaghetti were a solid three stars, but after my shocking take out order and misdescribed dishes the most I can give this restaurant is two stars.
The first time i came here, I was heavily underwhelmed.  What did I order? The first two items I saw pop up on Yelp.  Nam kao tod and drunken noodles.  So yes, the nam kao tod is more unique fare than what you get at other thai restaurants but it is FAR from what i would consider crave-worthy.  And wtf, Drunken noodles? Yes they're good, but if you've ever had pad see ew, it's pretty similar and way cheaper at other places.  . . So why five stars for this place?? CRISPY DUCK W/ PANANG CURRY and GARLIC PRAWNS!!!! There's a reason I hesitate now whenever I think of going into any other Thai restaurant...  I want those two specific dishes and no one but Lotus of Siam can deliver.  These two dishes combined were life changingly good for me.  Yea they're expensive and yes the portions COULD be larger, but it's pure crack I tell you!  So don't putz around with the other items unless this isn't your first time and you wanna try something different or you somehow don't like crack laced food.  Drooling as i write this review...
This is the best thai restaurant in Las Vegas. The place is a little bit ghetto and scary from the outside but don't let the outside fool you. The inside is very nice.
Was expecting a lot better. Sadness. . . Pad See Ew (2.5 stars) Pretty bland, not much flavor. Got a level 3 spicy and it was a good amount if you're a mid to low spice person.. . Drunken noodles (2.5 stars): More flavor than pad see ew, but again nothing too great.. . Garlic Prawns (4 stars): This was good, but pretty pricey. Garlic-y and crispy. . . Crispy Duck with Panang Curry (4 stars): They don't give you much duck but it was good and the panang was good too.. . Green curry (2 stars): Tasted very bland. Do not get this. . . I guess only a few things here are worth having. I wouldn't get the regular Thai food items because those are definitely not flavorful here. . . We had a birthday and asked the guy if they do anything. He said he could bring out ice cream with a candle which was nice (= . . SERVICE (3.5 Stars). Pretty good service for a busy restaurant. At first we only got like 5 menus for a group on 12...weird. I don't think the have enough for the restaurant. They brought out all the food at the same time, and kept refilling the rice when we asked. . . ATMOSPHERE (4 stars). Really big, tables are spaced out so you don't feel crowded. There are all these pics up of celebrities who came to the restaurant, but I didn't know more than half of them, haha. Waiting area in the front is crowded, and when you're done you feel the glare from the people waiting as you walk by hoping they get your table. The plaza it's in doesn't look like anything fancy. You wonder how this place can charge $23 for some dishes in this location, haha. There are taxis coming up dropping people off to try this place. I think it's just really hyped up. If it's supposed to be good thai food then the regular Thai dishes should have flavor too!
If I could give them a 10 I would!. . Came back here and ordered the specials in the back. Best decision of my life.. . Crispy Duck Panang - $24.95 - BEST CURRY OF MY LIFE!! I got level 8 again and it was not spicy enough. The Panang curry was life changing. It the creamy coconut flavor was amazing. The taste is indescribable! The duck was cooked perfectly. The skin is so crispy even though it is covered in curry. You get a huge portion of duck. I was so full afterwards but it was so good I had to finish. . . Garlic Prawns - $23.95 - OMG CRISPY!!! If you like deep fried shrimp, this is freaking legit. The shrimp are huge! The batter creates an amazing garlicy crispy texture. They even deep fried the shells! I actually liked the shell the most because of the strong shrimp flavor. Comes with rice. Only issue, as a meal, you get tired of it eventually. If this was served with a side of any thai noodles, it would be shrimp perfection! . . Warning, prices went up from a few month ago!. . This was hands down top 3 meals of my life.
I dream about finding restaurants like this.. . Huge menu, lots to explore, and a whole section on Northern Thai specialties.  The waiter says "you really prefer Northern Thai food?".  No, I'm just smart enough to make sure we include things you can't get at every strip mall Thai restaurant in the country.. . They are in a strip mall, by the way :). . I need to explore more, but let me recommend a few things we liked: NAM KAO TOD, KHAO SOI BRAISED SHORT RIB, THUM KA NOON (with Jackfruit!).. . My biggest regret is the number of times I went to Vegas and didn't know about this place.  Last trip went twice in 4 days.  Couldn't get enough.. . The food is outstanding and underpriced.. . I would take you there right now if I could.
So many celebrities on your walls. What am I?  Cottage cheese?  . . I ask you all. What's more important. Food or service?  I would say food but  I'm biased.. . I'm not a pain in the ass. But a brother can only take so much. I'm like Rambo walking into town all nice and what not, and you keep pushing me, pushing me, till you draw... First Blood. . . It's not that bad. I didn't get water hosed. But damn are these dudes ornery.  I didn't break up your monarchy or destroyed any semblance of democracy you might be holding onto, nor did I call you a "Shim". . I just made a reso, ordered from your baller wine list (German and Austrian) and ask for basic table maintenance. Plates cleared so I don't gotta stack it on my head or lap.  Asking for a chopstick should not be paramount to you to tilting your head back as if  I'm giving you a table side abortion. . . I know you Thais and Philippinos like using the spoon and fork thing. That's bad ass. But don't deny your ethnicity. I know you guys be using chopsticks in the closet.  . . Anyways. Food is dope. Only reason to go unless you are Anthony Bourdain. In that case, they physically put a server under your table to suck your Bouchon.  Just kidding. . . Everything tastes like something my aunties would not send back. It's a huge menu and it comes out fast. Totally and utterly delicious. I just want someone to treat me like I get treated when I'm in Thailand. Without the surprise penis.
Crispy Duck Panang.  Had it consecutive times in Vegas.  The panang curry was so delicious, that we scoop up til the last drop.  This dish is a must every time I go here.. Tom Kha soup broth is the best tasting ever.  Too bad they use white chicken meat. Sea Bass was excellent too. Had it with drunken noodle, but it should be good with anything else.. Crispy garlic prawn was interesting and good, but a bit salty.  Must eat that with the cabbage that is served with it.
Ok, so we showed up with no reservations.  Not a great idea, but it was early and they got us right in.  Dinner was on our table in less than 15 minutes.  Crispy Duck and Garlic Prawns what else can I say?  The food is always awesome at this place.  A tad bit pricey but well worth it for the quality you receive.  This place is always on my must do Vegas list.
Hands down the best Thai food in the country! I saw truly say this because of it's sophistication and how it's evolved through the years. I went there ages ago when it was a small strip mall restaurant. This time around they got more space next door and a walk in wine cellar, really?! . . So you would imagine that the food quality would suffer it bit because of the volume of traffic, NOT A BIT! I actually found subtle hints of improved flavor profiles and a combination of natural ingredients. There's no heavy salt and powdered spices to mask the otherwise dull flavors that most places have. . . Most ethnic restaurants have the ideology of heavily spicing road kill and people would buy it. But if you really knew what it was you would puke before it got to the table. Anyway, what I mean is that you can easily mess up fish and spice, but not here. They really get it.. . The menu is vast and complex for those who don't know much about Thai food, so ideally you want to gowith a large group and get as much as you can to taste. . . This is also probably the only Thai restaurant in the country that I know of that has such a well selected wine list. I think I know wine but when I saw this I was shocked! Pairings from regions beyond us so you go in blind and it just works! They know their stuff and will guide you well.. . So now it's an annual event during convention time to go to Lotus. I look forward to my meal next year again.
I used to come to this place more frequently and always loved there lunch buffet but this time we came back it was not there any more . I was so disappointed with our visit first we sat at our table for more the 15 min before anyone came to us and then we asked for water with lemon and it took about another 5 min to get the lemon had to ask several times for it. Our service was horrible we waited about 30 min to get our food and during that time the waiter never came to the table to check up on us well he didn't come up to us the whole time  we were there we had to look for him . When it was time to order dessert that took about another 20 min and again the waiter never came to apologize for the wait he didn't even look at us every time he passed the table it was like we weren't even there . I used to love this place but I don't think I will be going back . I gave it 3 stars only because I know how good it used to be otherwise I would give it 2 stars
This is the one. I mean the #1. Like the best Thai I have ever had. Saw a review from someone complaining about the pad Thai or something.....really?  You visit a Michelin star rated restaurant and order a dish you can get at every Thai restaurant in America?. . They have so many super unique dishes I would really suggest asking a waiter for help because they are really helpful and knowledgeable. I had the crispy duck in the parang curry and it was unreal good.  Can't remember the other two dishes by name but the flavors with wonderful.. . Trust me the wait is worth it. You won't get this kind of food on the strip
I LOVE this place.  The reason for only 3 stars has to do with how they run the business (see last paragraph).  I've eaten Thai food all over the country - California, Oregon, Colorado, New York, Florida, etc and this by far is the best Thai food I have ever tasted.. . Favorite dishes are of course the Chicken Pad Thai, Rad Na, and a soup I had with coconut milk, veggies, mushrooms, shrimp (forgot the name).  I ordered a beef type of salad last time and it was so fresh.  Love the little cucumber salad that is served with the Chicken Satay appetizers.  Thai BBQ chicken was very good - and the sweet and sour sauce that homes with it is homemade and delicious.. . Get there as early as possible as there is always a wait.  You can make reservations, but not for the same day and they will only hold your table for 5 minutes so be on time.. . My complaint is they should have some kind of voicemail that has their hours and not just let their phone ring and ring for people to guess.  I've also called during business hours and their phone isn't being answered (I'll call back several times and it just rings and rings).  Frustrating to call when I'm in town and I can't get through to make a reservation or place a take-out order.
Outside the establishment, taped to the window is a sign: do not leave valuables in car. I took note, but when they had it posted again inside the restaurant, I made sure to go back and grab anything that even looked remotely interesting to the zombies that were milling about. . . Little did I know that the real robbery would occur after we got our food. . . The curry was very thin, almost water. All of the dishes came on shallow plates, five dishes later the three of us were still a bit hungry. The spicy beef salad was drenched in sweet dressing. . . I've definitely had better. They seem to be doing ok, judging by all of the celebrity photos and the fact that there were several large groups there that night. But I don't see a reason to go back.
Seriously love this place!!! And their fried tofu app yummmm. I'm from Arizona an my boyfriend and I love it here when we come to Vegas no other thai place compares to this spot. This trip how ever they are closed till 5:30 (Sunday) so we won't be able to eat here our flight leaves soon. But we will be back. With big appetites !
We got here right before they open again at 5:30PM and there were already people waiting. We didn't have a reservation but were seated quickly anyhow. It looks like a small restaurant on a large empty strip mall but inside it's considerably spacious and nicely decorated. We ordered the nam kao tod, garlic prawns, crispy duck panang curry, and softshell crab drunken noodles. All were super delicious.Garlic prawns were probably my favorite - it's done so well - super crispy on the outside but perfectly done on the inside. Pricey but still worth it.
Five stars all around for this fine establishment. The appearance may be tricky at first, but don't judge a book by its cover. This hidden gem, In a plaza on the outskirts of the Las Vegas strip has some of the most delectable, mouthwatering Thai food in the country. From their amazing Pad Thai, to the crispy chicken wings, the curry duck and there amazing wine selection. lotus of Siam is a meal you won't want to miss. . . PS. Get there early at lunch time to make sure you get a table. . . Enjoy
My favorite Thai food in the freaking USA!  I've been all over Thailand several times, and I swear this food is just as delish, except you won't get diarrhea from eating it haha.. . I don't even know what to recommend...my mom is super Asian, so we just let her take the reigns and order to her heart's delight, family style.  I know we usually get the hot pot with seafood (not chicken, it's not as good), fried catfish salad, this peppery steak dish that I'm drooling for right now, and stuffed poultry legs of some kind.. . If you reeeeaaaallllly want to know what to order, PM me and I'll ask my mom.  No joke.  She is like an Asian food master queen, and I'm that passionate about this restaurant.. . This place is definitely a little hole in the wall, is always packed, and the area is more than a little sketchy looking.  There is even a sign that says to not leave valuables in your car.  Be prepared to encounter some homeless American citizens in the parking lot.  But it is so worth it.  Plus you'll forget about your car getting robbed for the hour while you are eating because the food is so good.. . Oh and afterwards...go to the massage place to your right when you exit the restaurant.  Way cheaper and just as great as anything you will get on the strip :)
So here's the diggity... The food is above average (taste) and the prices are cheap, hence why almost 2k reviews and 4 stars... I got 3 dishes, beer and wine, and got out for $60, with an excellent meal.  . . In other words, don't put yourself out and wait crazy time to eat here, it's not like the food is earth shattering or anything you can't find at another Thai restaurant, but if you want a great meal, cheap, with a massive wine selection, (and willing to wait an hour) this is the spot.  Call for resos!
Garlic Prawns? BFD. Papaya salad ok, nice heat. The other dishes were so-so. Talk about resting on your laurels,or banking on 4 star reviews. However I do enjoy the time machine decor. We felt hurried as well.
Do you watch parts unknown? Do you like Anthony Bourdain? Yeah, that's pretty much me. And this place was recently featured, I thought I'd go  check it out for myself. . . Ordered some of my fav dishes.... pad kee mao aka drunk noodles. Pad Ka Prow aka mint/basil leaf chicken. Crying tiger. Crispy duck paneng (favorite, eat it while its hot). And the Sai Oua sausage. . Split among 3 people, we killed it.. . Portions here is not the best for the price. But each dish was tasty. Not to sound snobby or anything, but us angelinos are really spoiled by the diversity of our city. The flavors here is not something I haven't had before for a lot cheaper. I mean, I guess in Vegas, if you must have authentic Thai, this place will suffice. But if you are just like me, an Angelino visiting vegas, no need to make the special homage to this restaurant.
I liked this place, but it was told that it was going to be the "best thai food ever." It was not the best curry I have ever had, however, the summer rolls (wait, were they spring or summer) were the best I have ever had. Fresh minty deliciousness!!!! . . They also have a daytime buffet that closes early, so I wasn't able to get it (folks in line said NOT to get the buffet), but I wished I had since I would have been able to try more dishes. . . Plus, this joint is only a quick but fun drive from The Strip. I saw a tranny trying to light she/he/their crackpipe in a storefront so I drove around the block a few extra times it was so entertaining! Score.
Pretty decent Thai food in Vegas! Super busy though. But I would definitely come back
This is the best Thai restaurant in Vegas, for that matter, best Thai restaurant you'll find pretty much anywhere.  It's in a shady looking strip mall - don't bring your Lamborghini.  . . The place is big, tons of tables, multiple rooms, but there is almost always a wait after 5:30.  Get there early, and enjoy the experience.. . The menu is ginormous.  The service has always been comprehensive when I've been there - waiters are attentive, and help out with other tables when they're not busy.  . . The food is great - think of it as "upscale" Thai without inflating the price too much over your neighborhood "meh" Thai place.  . . Four stars because the location is weird, the ambience could be a little better, and because I can never betray my heart, which says that nothing in Vegas should ever, ever get five stars.  Ever.  Because, Vegas.
So of course I had to check out what all the hype was about! The food was absolutely amazing. There was so much to choose from, we ended up going with a few of the servers suggestions. We had the nua Nam tok (beef dish) Tom kah kai (coconut soup)kao soy (curry w/ egg noodle) and a pad thai. The flavors were rich and definitely authentic. I appreciate this restaurant stays true to thai ingredients. My only complaint was the portions were slightly small, but other than that everything was great!
Love this place like a mother loves her child. The food here is amazing and is noted for their chef who was featured on Iron Chef. She's amazing in crafting the best curry and tom yum ever. Thai food frenzy this place but make sure to make reservations beforehand as this place is always crowded lol can't blame the people cause it's amazing here.
Busy so don't expect to be seated immediately, especially on weekends
Tried this place on the advice of Anthony Bourdain... It was not a disappointment !  Not a large amount of food but plenty and large on flavor.  Dishes are prepared from scratch. Service was prompt and friendly.
Love love love this place. Hands down best Thai in the state! Very authentic and a complete surprise when you walk in the door
Ate lunch here. It Was Pretty good. I saw a wall full of famous people that came to the restaurant,  such as Alicia Keys, Nicolas Cage and some famous stars from the Food Network. Can't remember all the dishes we ordered, but we got pad see ew, crab, red curry, and some other dishes. Service was good and quick. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a good authentic Thai restaurant near the strip.
This is my daughter's favorite Thai restaurant, so she took me here for my 70th birthday.  I always have Green Curry the first time I try a Thai restaurant - and was extremely happy!  One of the best, anywhere!
This restaurant was on Travel Channel's Best Eats Episode. Winnas! Great Tai Food. Garlic shrimp, Drunken Noodles with pork, and their famous chili dip-Nam prik Ong (combo of ground pork, tomatoes, n dried spices)
Wow, how have I not written a review for this place yet?. . You can't go wrong with any dish here, which is what makes this restaurant so great. I'll admit, not every dish is amazing, but at least you won't be stuck with something yucky. It all just comes down to how much you love Thai food.. . The wait is typically fairly long (waited 1 hour last time for a table for 3 on a Sunday night), but this time we only waited 15 minutes for a table on a Friday night. Luckily, tables for 2 typically get seated much quicker.. . We ordered:. - Panang Curry: The curry had really good flavor, but I thought it was kind of plain. They don't give you any additional vegetables.. . - Pad Thai: The noodles are different from your norm (they're thinner), but the flavor is good. I got mine with fried tofu and the fried tofu is really yummy! I normally don't like meats with my pad thai because they are normally made dry, but next time, I'll definitely try it with chicken. I don't think Lotus of Siam will disappoint.. . - Mango Sticky Rice: THE BEST PART OF THE MEAL.This is the best mango sticky rice I've had. The rice is not actually too sticky and is made perfectly! MUST TRY.
This place rocks. Break out of your Pad Thai rut and order Northern specialties like the Kao Tod appetizer - spicy sour sausage salad, and the whole catfish, charcoal grilled. Ask for the two sauces, chili-lime and tamarind. Order a glass of Riesling from their extensive collection. You'll be glad you did.
Go for the buffet it worth it menu changes every day for the buffet but what ever the put out is good. Family oriented business. great service, friendly and nice
Don't waste your time here. This is the kind of place people go to simply because a lot of other people go.. . We arrived at 5:20 PM Sunday (they open at 5:30) and there was already a big line outside in 102 degree heat. People in Las Vegas must not have anything better to do than stand in line?. . Once the doors opened the staff was adequate. We were seated quickly and the food came out fast enough.. . The problem is how unbelievably small the portion size is. I literally took 4 spoonfuls of my $12 massuman chicken curry and the bowl was empty. The chicken was tough, dry, and tasteless. No spice to the very thin, watery sauce at all. I was literally done eating within 5 minutes. My wife had $13 Pad Thai and it was very small too. . . When we were leaving, the lobby was stacked with people waiting to eat. It really makes no sense to me.
Amazing food, very flavorful, and incredibly helpful service who advised against some items we were getting that had a similar sauce and then recomended something else that was amazing. And the price is so reasonable! Definitely worth the cab ride off of the stip.
When members of my family came to town, they solicited the help of me. My years with Yelp gave them full trust to come to me with recommendations around the valley. On one of those nights, everyone was in the mood for Asian food, so I decided to take them here. I've taken food out of this place before but never really sat in and ordered. What a great opportunity!. . This place is located in a very weird shopping center. Lots of different shops and bars, to say the least. There are a couple of gay bars, a swingers club and a lot of Asian food joints. Also remember that if you don't make reservations days before, they will not take reservations that day and you will have to wait. A long time. For a party of 10, we were quoted up to 2 hours and ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes. The waiting room is pretty tight but filled with awards, reassuring you that this place was going to be the bomb! The service was great. They were efficient, didn't say much, but got us what we needed in a quick timely manner. The place was a little drab. Dark carpets and wooden paneling made for an outdated look. The main focal point however, was a wall full of wine. An actual wine cabinet filled with hundreds of bottles. Super dramatic and awesome! There's also a bar down the ramp inside, so you can drink something while you wait for your table. . . For dinner, me and my party decided on the following:. . Garlic Black Pepper Chicken Wings for $8.95: Wings seasoned with garlic, black pepper and other seasonings. The garlic was prominent in this dish and made the wings soo delicious. One of my favorite things that evening!. . Moo Yang for $14.95. Marinated charbroiled pork served with spice sauce. This is always my go to dish. The pork chop was super tender, the sweet marinade and the sauce really seemed to enhance the dish. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this if you like pork.. . Chicken Pad Se-ew for $9.95. Stir-fried wide rice noodles with eggs and Chinese broccoli with black soy sauce. This was the best Pad Se-ew I've ever had! The flat noodles were soft but not mushy, the sauce was mild and salty and really made that dish pop out!. . Pork Drunken Noodles for $9.95. Pan fried flat rice noodle topped with, sauteed choice of meat with fresh & dry chili, Thai basil, served on beds of greens. I loved the basil in this dish. It brought a clean flavor to the overall taste. . . All dishes were served family style and was awesome! People always talk about this place as being great. You really need to try this out, for sure! I remember waiting in the front at the beginning of the night and everyone that kept coming in, made a comment like, "this place is in a sketchy neighborhood, but trust me the food is out of this world." It's not until you experience it yourself that you will truly believe that statement. If you're ever in the neighborhood, don't pass it. Stop, and give it a try. You will NOT be disappointed!
DUCK NOODLE SOUP. . . I've never had anything like it...the broth was sweet, tangy, and addictive. I've had duck noodle soup at various other Thai restaurants in California but Lotus of Siam makes it incredibly well. Came here at 6pm on a Sunday night with 3 others. We made a reservation, so we were seated promptly. When we left at 8pm, there were about 20 people waiting in line. I would not come here without making a reservation.. . While vacationing in Vegas, several people were telling us about Lotus of Siam. Some went so far as to describe this restaurant as the best Thai restaurant in all of America. I'm not sure if I can confirm that statement, but it is pretty darn good Thai food. . . We ordered:. Panang Curry: (5/5). Pad See Ew: (5/5). Pad Kee Mau: (5/5). Catfish soup: (3/5) I would not get this again. Duck noodle soup: )6/5) When can I come back here?!! Can't get enough of this stuff. . . Random fact: they have an extensive wine menu and a poppin' bar area.
The BEST thai in LAS VEGAS, this place is amazing.. It is a bit overcrowded but man was the wait worth it... The service was excellent and the food was delicious!  Crispy Duck curry was very good.. It still had the crispy skin taste and hold it flavor even with the beautiful curry taste... The Tom Yum soups are amazing with very good spice.. I should've order for myself instead of sharing-HaHaHa :D but come here if your looking for a good time.. They serve beer,sake, and many selection of wine... :D enjoy! Because you will when you come here to dine...
I came here with a large group, so we had a decent amount of food (bill came out to be ~$250). My Thai friend ordered all the dishes for us so that we could share family style. . . First off, this place is pricey. Secondly, the food is not worth the price both taste-wise and proportion-wise. So I won't come back, unless I'm with friends who want to go. Considering I got to try about 10 different dishes from here, I'm pretty sure my mind won't change. . . We had various dishes. So here goes. Shrimp pad thai - according to my Thai friend, authentic pad thai is with shrimp. It wasn't bad, but the portion was really small. As a little Asian girl, I easily could've eaten the whole plate without sharing. I also didn't like how it didn't come with nice helpings of limes, vegetables, and peanuts on the side like how almost all the Thai places in southern California serve it. The noodles weren't cooked well and often clumped together. Good pad thai doesn't clump. Crispy pork - this was disgusting. I tried 2 pieces and had to discreetly spit it out into my napkin. It tastes like bone marrow. I know that sounds odd. But basically, the pork was fried so much that the meat and breading tasted like old bone marrow. Sounds gross? Well it was gross. Tom kah kai - the soup was not good. Usually this soup is really flavorful. This was bland. Drunken noodle - like the pad thai, the noodles here were not the perfect consistency. They were cooked too long and therefore clumped. Fish curry - according to my friend, this is a special dish that isn't often served because it's hard to make. Well if this place did it right, there's a reason why it's not often served; it's because it tastes like old fish flopping in mealy sauce. But it'll probably taste better somewhere else. Northern larb (pork) - it tasted like unseasoned ground pork. Wasn't impressed at all. Red curry with chicken - like everything else, it's not as flavorful as I've had at other places. I'm sure there were some other dishes I tried, and since I don't remember them, they probably didn't strike my fancy either. . . When I think of Thai cuisine, I typically think of complex flavors perfectly orchestrated together to create sweet and savory dishes that stimulate all your taste buds. I'm not sure how many times the word "bland" comes to mind when I think of Lotus of Siam. To me, that is an atrocity for Thai cuisine. And if the food wasn't bland, it's because it tasted gross instead, which means the flavors were jumbled and not properly managed. To top off the bad food, the prices weren't good. Each person barely had a full plate of food and had to pay $25. I could get more bang for my buck by going to a buffet.  . . This place was very disappointing, considering the many reviews. But honestly, I should learn by now that I probably need to hold Las Vegas to a different standard from Los Angeles. It's like the dumber child that you just have to come to accept as it is.
Some people deem this restaurant the best for Thai food in the world. I wouldn't go that far as I have had my fair share across the globe but it is definitely one of the better restaurants in Vegas for Thai. The location is far from exceptional but the staff is friendly and the food is extraordinary. If you come on a weekend without a reservation be prepared for an extreme wait time.
I love Asian cuisine.... Heck I love food in general! LoS was introduced to me from a Vegas native. It is off the strip in a more residential commercial area. There is definitely a wait during dinner time enough the restaurant is huge! . . I enjoyed every single dish! Even the waiter agreed that all my dishes are great choices (maybe he says this to all his guests). . . 1. Roasted Duck Curry- Yanno the Peking duck that is roasted in a lot of Chinese restaurants? Yeah! That one. BUT Crispier. Smother some red curry over it. BAM. . 2. Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp- Ya can't go wrong with lemony-spicy soup!. . 3. Drunken Noodles with some kind of fish (Sea Bass??) I am not sure, but the fish was soft, the noddles were extra carby, and the sauce is nice and savory.. . 4. Thai Iced Tea- Duh!. . 5. Fried Garlic Shrimp- Crispy, Garlic-y, Great dipped in that curry sauce!
Yes indeed this is the best Thai restaurant in North America. Does it have some fame and press with all those famous chefs and celebrities that frequent this place, Yes, but it delivers in quality, creativeness and authenticity. Its not cheap since you are paying a little bit for its reputation and fame but the food is great. A must when you are in Vegas. Go before 6:30pm to avoid the long lines. If you are new to Thai food and are the adventurous type, just ask the waiters to order for you. Tell them your likes and dislikes and approximately how much you want to spend and let them take care of it. It is the most fun way to eat.
Went for first time tonight. We didn't make a reservations. Big mistake.  Waited 1 1/2 hours, but well worth the wait.  The best Thai restaurant I've ever eaten at. An incredible menu.  Much more than the standard Thai fare.  Service was typical for an Asian restaurant, but everyone was very friendly. When in Las Vegas, this is the place to go for Thai food.  It's in a dumpy strip mall, but you're going for the food.
One of, if not the best Thai places in Vegas. Huge menu with great choices all over. The Thai Iced coffee here is pretty good too, but you know the iced T is better. The  nam prik ong is so good I had to recreate that for parties.
Fantastic experience.  Amazing flavors and great service.  Go to the back of the menu for the northern cuisine.  Can't wait to go again.  Much better value than any restaurant on the strip.
