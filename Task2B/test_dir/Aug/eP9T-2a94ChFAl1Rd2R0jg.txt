Loved this hotel. We got an awesome deal off Hotwire for two nights for a spur of the moment trip. . . Walking into this hotel, the smell is beyond good. Can't explain it but so nice to be in a nonsmoking hotel. The fresh smell was even in our room.. . Checkin was a breeze even at almost midnight. The checkin person even gave our 3 year old a Trump kids pack that had sunglasses and coloring book with crayons. She loved it and it saved us throughout our trip. . . Our room was fabulous. Huge bathroom with a gigantic jacuzzi tub. Huge separate shower. Also a TV in mirror of bathroom. We had a great view of the pool and looking south of strip. Bed was comfortable. . . Since the Trump Hotel is not right on the strip have a shuttle to drop off at Wynn or Caesars. Very easy to do. Though we ended up walking through mall and more specifically Nordstrom's to get back to hotel. . . Never went to pool as way too hot. . . Enjoyed the refrigerator and microwave that were in room. Lots of storage. . . Definitely recommend this hotel.
So DISAPPOINTED! I was really looking forward to staying at Trump specifically because of the Trumpkids program as I am traveling with my 7mo baby.  When I booked the reservation I had specifically asked for a full size crib to be set up which I was told will not be a problem.  The rep did not say it is "subject to availability".  When I checked in I was informed "the crib has already been set up in your room".  I was really excited because it was near the baby's nap time.  When I walked in, no crib.  Called housekeeping, and was sent a pack n play with nosheets.  There was no explanation and none of the other kid items were brought over such as shampoo, children's book as described in the program.  Called housekeeping was transferred to concierge who than had a mgr called me.  I was told "a crib is subject to availability" and everything will be taken care of.  So we decided to take a swim first. When we returned, there is now baby shampoo but still no bedding or anything else! I am starting to get upset so decided to go downstairs to speak to a mgr.  After explaining to Jerry the situation he said "you are correct, it should've been done right the first time and I'll personally see to the situation and give you a call".  Went to dinner and back, there is now some sheet in the pack n play AND A BOTTLE OF INDUSTRIAL CLEANER INSIDE".  This is a five star hotel! I was expecting things to be done right UPON ARRIVAL and when item requested are not available I expect to receive an explanation! No call from Jerry to say "no crib was available" as well!! Now it's near 4am and I can't sleep because I have no choice but to share the bed with my infant which is unsafe! Had I known this I would've brought my own pack n play with my own sheets that's made for it!!
What a beautiful hotel. . . It's just a bit off the strip (walking distance). It's directly across the street from the mall. . Upon walking in, it smells beautiful. The whole place smells delicious. The smell is like a spa/fresh flowers. The hotel is quiet and has no casino so there wasn't any smoke stink. . . The suite was clean and even has a little stove and refrigerator. The pillows and comforter was down. There was a television in the bathroom and a hot tub. . . The pool was beautiful with lots of shade and opportunities to tan. It wasn't over crowded and had a DJ playing great music. The cabana was clean and beautiful. It had AC, a TV and mini fridge. The service at the pool was phenomenal. The food was delicious as well. The pool had a really shallow part for families with young children.  . . They have a shuttle that takes you to any hotel you want every 15 minutes. . . We were so close to the mall and we were  able to get out make up done at MAC before we went out. . . It was a awesome. I would LOVE to come back here.
Have stayed here twice annually for 4 years for 4-5 day business events. Love the hotel. . . The rooms are wonderfully detailed and decorated. The jacuzzi tub is great after a long day standing on a concrete showroom floor in a trade show! . . The in room dining has many good options. Both healthy and decadent. The service is impeccable from the front desk, to the bar, to the maid service. . Because I'm in LV for business, I need a good night's sleep. This hotel is smoke free and no casino so I don't have to hear partiers yelling down the hallways at 4AM. Instead, I enjoy a large room with a fridge, stove top, kitchen sink, wall of cabinets and closets and glass shelves with nice art pieces. A little living room, large king bed and an enormous bathroom with dual sinks, shower, separate tub, separate loo area with door.. . Summary: epic service, amenities (restaurants, pool, spa, fitness center, bars), LV views and across the after from an incredible shopping mall with a little grocery/liquor store in it.
i made a reservation for this hotel for november through expedia with a "pay at check in option". i then noted, on my canadian credit card, that I had been charged for a portion of the hotel stay! I contacted expedia to find out why I got charged, and they were not sure as to why that would have occurred. I was extremely disappointed with this action occurring and decided to book at another hotel as I felt deceived by the "pay at check in option". With cancelling my reservation, I did receive a refund from Trump, but it was less than what I was charged leaving ME out of money! . I contacted Trump to find out why and they said there was nothing i could do as they always charge for one night and if that was not clear on expedia, that was not their problem. As well, they explained the difference in funds may be due to the exchange rate. They were not willing to refund me the difference from the charge and felt that it was ultimately my issue with booking with them and using a canadian credit card. . I am so disappointed with this situation and how an international traveller would be treated and the lack of accountability taken by Trump hotels in the matter of having payment options listed on on expedia and what they actually do in reality. . Will I ever stay there? Unlikely as they are not customer focused, even for those guests who may become regular Trump hotel clients.
I have stayed at this hotel a few times over the last couple of years. This hotel offers a smoking free environment which is rare for Las Vegas. The restaurant offers good quality dining. The bar has live music on the weekends. There is no casino attached to the hotel. So it is nice and quiet. There is a gym on the second floor. Also on the second floor is a pool and patio dining. I always look forward to my next stay.
Good hotel had a room on the west side but the Union Pacific blew their horn a few times every night. Tv  in the bathroom mirror tub fits two people. Have to call housekeeping for cooking supplies. Tv kept freezing which I was no good.  It was an ok stay. I would give it 5stars but the train messed that up. Pool was good gym also.
Very clean hotel.jacuzzi is very huge,shower and bathroom are huge and clean.view was nice although it was the back of the hotel.lobby was nice and valet was great.now the bad.tv kept freezing every few hours for several minutes at a time.we were on the 55th floor and heard the train EVERY night all thruout the night loud and clearly.im a freight train engineer for u.p. and thats the last thing i want waking me up away from work,so that makes 6 nights of broken sleep all night,never good.i would not stay here again as we all know in vegas most people are in their hotel only to sleep.
Beautiful interior, doesn't smell like smoke at all because there are no casinos at the lobby and the spa bathtub was just epic! But still, there are a lot of reasons why it only deserves a three star rating from me. For a five-star hotel you would expect to have all the amenities in the hotel room, however, that is simply not the case. The hotel requires you to call in a request for all amenities such as utensils, cups, toiletries and they didn't even have a pen in the room.  I understand that they probably do this because they want you to tip the staff every time they deliver an amenity, but when you're booking a five-star hotel you would expect everything to be provided for you. Also I didn't like the elevator arrangements because if you booked two different rooms and one room happens to be on a different level than the other, there's a huge likelihood that you won't be able to take the same elevator to the other room, but instead you would actually have to go all the way to the lobby or to the ice room or to the pool in order to switch elevators. I booked a room on the 49th floor but my friend stayed on the 56 floor, when I asked a staff member which elevator was the most convenient way to get to my friend's room, the staff member had no idea. . Also there's only one restaurant (not open 24 hours) so if you wanted to order food you have to order from room service ($27 for a regular burger--the Trump burger...which wasn't even cooked right). . That being said I probably wouldn't stay here again because it is really inconvenient and if I wanted an epic bathtub I would probably go try out Cesar's palace next time.
Spent 2 nights at the Trump hotel Las Vegas, one of our favorite hotels if not the favorite. Love that there is no smoking and no casino. The hotel is located right across from the Fashion Show mall another plus. Everything is so clean and smells wonderful. The rooms have coffee makers something most Vegas hotels do not have and is important to hubby first thing in the morning. Having a microwave, fridge, and cooktop is nice to. The bathrooms are very luxurious with a TV in the mirror, love watching the news while getting ready to greet the world. The shower is beautiful and huge and there is a separate jacuzzi tub also huge. The staff is genuinely caring. Oh and the fitness center is kept very clean, has what you need and the pool area is nice to, we enjoyed using those facilities too. There is mandatory valet parking, so make sure you get everything you need from the car!
I'm going to keep this simple review about Trump hotel. One of the best hotel I have ever stay at. Their customer service is excellent.  The entire staff is wonderful. Our room 6400 two bedrooms 2 1/2 bath penthouse suite is outstanding . A perfect view of the entire strip. The room is literally under the letter "R".Their room are kept in excellent condition, and doesn't smell like smoke at all maybe because there is no smoking in the hotel at all. The master bathroom amazing, their king size bed is very comfortable,and great full kitchen,also a huge living room with one of the most comfortable couch ever. Highly recommended.. . Note they have a courtesy shuttle to the Wynn and Caesar Palace.
I have stayed in 5 star properties around the world, and The TRUMP in Las Vegas is NOT 5 stars.. PROS: Quick check in and fast elevators to 37th floor..       Excellent light lunch in lobby restaurant.. Paid $93+ fees and upcharges for a "5 Star" Hotel...read on. CONS: 1.)$25.00 "service" charge PER NIGHT for double beds..       2.)One waste basket next to tub, none in the room..       3.)Cell reception was non-existent in room thus lobby calls for any contact. .       4.) I left some items in the Valet parked car, when I asked valet to bring the car around ( literally 10 minutes after parking at 2:45 in the afternoon ) they said I can WALK WITH THEM TO MY PARKED CAR TO GET MY ITEMS. I did go with them and called the MOD(manager on duty) to voice my displeasure later that day. He defended the action until I stated.."IF I WAS D. TRUMP WOULD YOU HAVE HAD ME GO TO MY CAR???" GOOD POINT was his response...We have nicknamed the property "DUMP". 5.) Pool closes at 8:00 pm( WHAT???...This is Las Vegas not senior retirement center.. 6.) Waste baskets were full and rarely clean.. 7.) TV in bathroom mirror had HBO but large HDTV in room didn't..weird.. 8.)$25.00 per day , per room.."resort fee" covers wifi..Motel 6 has FREE WIFI and coffee.. 9.) $5.00 coffee in lobby ..should be FREE.. . Go to Wynn, Bellagio, Encore or Four Seasons to truly experience a 5 star hotel. TRUMP aka DUMP is a joke.
The hotel was beautiful, I was getting married at the quad and my parents booked us the room at the trump, they upgraded the room at no charge because we were getting married and we also received a complimentary bottle of wine. When I first walked in the staff was so friendly and answered every question I had. I also brought my dog with me and he received some free things as well. We walk our dog three times a day, and they have a convenient places to walk him outside. When we were settled in we took the free shuttle to ceasers palace and walked up and down the strip. They also have a shuttle that goes to the wynn, and they both pick up and take you to those two hotels, which is nice so you don't have to pay for a taxi. The room was incredible! I was having my pre-wedding pictures done of me getting ready in the bathroom so my concern for the room we got was the bathroom and they exceeded my standards! I was so impressed with how beautiful the bathroom looked! This hotel was amazing and so was everybody that worked there!!!
Trump- my 2nd time stay! Really likes the hotel during first time visit, had a chance to get offer for an upgrade to their corner suite! The hotel suite was Hugeeeeeee! Everything clean and nice, has little kitchen area, bedroom and the bathroom is bigger than the bedroom..with city view next to the bathtub!
Luxurious but disorganized.. . We paid for a room that was unavailable when we arrived.  They upgraded us to a huge, beautiful suite.. . Only one bed so they promised to bring a "roll-in".  Despite reminding them, the bed never arrived and my daughter had to sleep on the sofa.. . The room service meal was excellent but they failed to return to remove the mess and numerous accessories, despite calling them twice.. . The in-room telephone is overly complicated and you need to be an engineer to figure it out.. . The elevators are confusing,  some buttons work on the right elevator bank, others only on the left side.. . I'd give them only one star except  that the place is so damn beautiful  and the food is great.. . --Daddy Maxx Retro
Super overrated. I'll tell you what was nice and then I'll tell you the rest. . . Nice: . 1) good express deal on Priceline. 2) tv in restroom mirror. 3) jacuzzi tub. 4) shuttle to hotels that are actually on the strip. 5) complimentary valet, water, and wifi. . The rest:. 1) room had cereal in the bed first night. 2) daily "resort fee" makes up for the express deal . 3) they charge for towels. 4) salon/spa hella expensive for mediocre service. Got my nails done and a week later, they're cutting my sheets.. 5) those complimentary items and shuttle are part of that "resort fee". Complimentary no longer means free apparently. . . For this to be the all exclusive expensive Trump experience, meh. I've had better at a Holiday Inn Express, lol. . . When I go back, I'll prob stay at the Wynn. Spent more of my time there anyway.
My gf made reservations for us off of Priceline and yup we ended up at the trump. I refuse to stay anywhere in Las Vegas other than a 4-5 star with a casino but I must say I have done the west gate which is now the hilton grand vacation, I have stayed at the palms villas and yes the trump is pretty good peeps. The property is almost as if on strip, it's literally half a block off the strip, property is well kept and extremely clean and upscale. Restaurant and bar were great, the front desk staff were 5 star, bell desk and valet prolly one of best service overall. The rooms are great, well kept and clean, nice floor plans, I got a one bedroom suite upgrade for 50 a night. The pool was great and service poolside was just your usual vegas style, nothing more or less. One negative about my stay, bad phone reception.
I will say that we did enjoy our stay.  For what we were looking for it was great.. . For the five stars from other websites this hotel should have been much better.  It's a little out of the way when it comes to its surroundings.  The rooms are nice but not quite "finished" or outfitted, the amenities are either outdated or not useful.For example, we were in a nice suite with a full kitchen but completely empty of anything useful like glasses or utensils.  We could have requested this but didn't.  One phone didn't work and there were no listings of phone extensions such as for the concierge or room service.  The televisions were a bit dated too.  The views were amazing and the whirlpool bath was fantastic but the decor was very plain.  It just didn't quite measure up to a five star hotel.  The pool was super crowded, little to no shade and filled with very very super loud techno music with lots of the hipster crowd showing off.  There is no way I'd ever use the pool area, this alone was enough to make the hotel experience a bad one.  The service was very good and the staff was friendly and helpful where they could be.  I have no complaints with the service from the staff.  Room service pricing was very reasonable too.  Parking is a pain, don't plan on easily coming and going.
Cons:. You hear the train every morning!!!!. Bathroom Door literally was stuck had to forcefully pull to open. Housekeeping was not clean (dust under tables). Ice room was not cleaned for the 2 days I was there. Refrigerator not cold. Room service took 1 hour!. Maintenance never came, called twice. . Pros:. Spacious. Near Wynn/Encore. Shuttles
Not bad as a hotel to stay in away from the casinos. But HORRENDOUS to host an event here. The different teams of banquet, catering, marketing, sales and finance do not talk to each other at all, and for an event this is a NO Go. we learnt it the hard way - so beware!. . Was planning a reunion event by working with several hotels. Trump was the worst in terms of responses and locking up, but the prices were competitive, so we went ahead. . Then came the bigger nightmare of absolute unprofessionalism.. . Post event - they first didnt provide have an invoice, but charged for an amount 2 days after the event. Which we found was in the ballpark of previous agreement so it was okay.. . A month later a bigger invoice was charged to another credit card . Most (80%) of the expenses were double charged and they charged us for things from a different event (that had nothing do with us). Best part - finance had no clue we were charged before and they wont respond to us for weeks - but havent taken the charge back! Not a recognition of the mistake, no apology and more importantly no refund or resolutionI Asked to escalate, tried to reach out on twitter to get a resolution - NOTHING! Charges on my card remain and now am taking the credit card to dispute the transaction. All this pain for a event in vegas?? Sheesh!. So here you go - this is a well deserved HORRIBLE rating for event-hosting. Give trump a skip.. . The issue is still not resolved. I would gladly like to have a conversation with the GM to talk about not just this issue, but some serious operational issues with this establishment. Tried reaching them on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter - nothing whatsoever.
I've been to Las Vegas numerous times, each time staying at a different hotel because I was never fully satisfied with any of these hotels.  This past weeks I stayed at the Trump Hotel. I need not look for another hotel to stay at in Vegas again.  First off, it's just a hotel; no casino. Yeah. Second, it's a non smoking hotel. Yeah. When you enter the hotel, it smells fresh and clean.  It's bright and very elegant in the front.  You don't have to walk a long distance to get the the registration desk.. . The hotel has a free shuttle that runs all day and night to the Wynn and to the Caesar Fourm Shops every 15 minutes.. . The rooms are immaculate and large. The bathrooms are large as well. They have an inset bathtub with jacuzzi jets.  Also, the large bathroom mirror has a tv inset into it.  Unique and cool.. . The staff was friendly and helpful.. . Bottom line is that this is the best hotel I've ever stayed at in Las Vegas.  All of my future stays will be at the Trump.
