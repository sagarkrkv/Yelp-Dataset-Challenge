Ok. Love this chain. Not sure about this location. They seem to always be busy. Saying that.... . . Hire more help. Train your staff to help each others customers not ignore them.. . Once our server Ashley came over things improved. Food came out quick. Tasted great. Score went from a * to a *** only because the ball started rolling.
One of the best breakfast places I've ever been to! The service was impeccable-- customers are able to flip an egg decoration from a happy face to a sad face when in need of something. Employees are required to attend to the table immediately! We did this just to test it out and it was literally 3 seconds until someone came over to attend to our needs.. . Food was delicious and reasonably priced. Great place!
Consistently the best breakfast in Vegas!  Best service and the menu has a huge variety of items.  You could go everyday and get something different every time, but I definitely recommend the Mexican omelet!
Stacey,  our wonderful server couldn't of made it any better,  positive and helpful. Food was excellent can't wait to come back.
Great prompt service, good food. We have been here several times and are always pleased with them.
They had allllllll kinds of great breakfast/lunch choices.  I selected a yummy island style meal (think Hawaiian).... My guy loved his biscuits & gravy.
Egg-cellent food & service. I ordered the Loco Moco, a Hawaiian stapled & gravy is the secret. Great job guys. Karla was super friendly & patient w/ our massive group during prime time brunch on sunday. She was soo kind as to anticipate our needs, service was efficient & everything came out hot & correct! Good work guys. Will stop by on our next visit soon!
Erin was an exceptional waitress.  Her suggestions on the food were very helpful.  Only downfall is that they don't accept American Express
Wonderful breakfast - what a gem of a place! Our server Staci was friendly, the banana nut muffin was to die for, and one of the best omlettes I have ever had!  My new breakfast place whenever I visit Vegas!
Love the egg & I! Consistently delish breakfast every time we visit. Try the chicken fried steak & fiesta skillets. Lovely service, especially Stacie :)
Alyssa! OMG! You are awesome. Wish we could be regulars so you could be our regular server! Service was great. I got biscuits and gravy, awesome first bite but then a bit salty. Service made up for seasoning.
We tried Egg & I on a recent trip working in Vegas. It's hard to find good breakfasts, and the reviews here made me think we found the holy grail of breakfast spots! The reality: not so good.. . I had a benedict. I asked for the eggs medium hard, and they came out essentially hardboiled (I am not holding that against them), but worse, the hollandaise was pretty awful. Sort of an off, slightly grainy texture, no lemon to cut the richness, just unappetizing. Potatoes seemed too regular, like processed frozen potatoes. . . On the upside, I tried one of the banana nut muffins, and it was pretty good. The staff was wonderful--really nice, helpful, on point. . . If only the food had lived up to them.....
Not sure what all the high reviews on this place is about. This is your standard ordinary breakfast place. The service is excellent, very friendly and nice waitresses. The menu is great, lots of variety to choose from. But the food was just average. I was really disappointed in my bacon and avocado omelette. I thought they seriously forgot to add the bacon. I dug through the omelette for it and finally saw tiny small crumbles of it in there. The egg was thick and dry and the only good thing about it was the avocado chunks inside. Big pieces of avocado. That's IT.  The potatoes it came with were not good. Just deep fried potatoes. The side of fruit was much better. The corned beef hash was mushy and had a lot of potatoes. Was disappointed in that too. Why the heck all the stars, yelpers?? . Ok ok, the muffin was probably the best part. They give you choice of toast or muffin. Get the muffin!
Our last place we visited before coming home from Vegas. Thank you YELP for letting me find you. This place was the Bomb.com. I loveddd it!!  This place was super packed however we only had to wait 5 minutes before getting seated. Simple menu on paper but tons of options. I ordered the Chicken Skillet, my husband ordered the chocolate chip pancakes.  Both items were reallyyyy good however the chocolate chip pancakes were total overload, the pancakes were drenched in chocoalte chips and i love chocolate but it was a little too much actually not a little just TOO MUCH for my liking even my teeth starting to hurt because of the sweetness.. The prices were really reasonable and food was good and the service was awesome especially for how busy it was all.  . . You must visit this place! yummmmy!
bomb.com .. And Alyssa was such a good server ... We'll be coming here more often not bad first my first time trying it
Had brunch with my daughter there on Sunday after church. They were full of customers and was very pleased at how fast we were seated. The food is very good, served hot with large portions. The sever Linnea was prompt and friendly. Great   overall experience !!
What a great find! I ordered the eggs benedict that comes with the works potato and it's amazing! The plate could easily feed two! . . Our waitress was super friendly and knew  what we needed without having us call her!  I'm a little sad i didn't get a chance to use the eggy help flag (there's a flip egg stand on each table that you flip over if you need anything). But at the end of the meal,  I don't care, food was great and the service was exceptional because our waitress, Carole Anne, was awesome!!
I love this place! I always get the vege Benny cuz it is soooooo delicious :) and our server Staci was the best!! I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't always so friggin cold in here.
We had Ashley. We had an awesome experience. She made sure everything was taken care of in a timely manner.
What a great atmosphere!  Even though we were in Las Vegas, this could have been a small-town diner anywhere in the US. . . We had a great breakfast with banana-nut muffins, of course!  We were going to share a chile relleno omelet, and asked for an extra muffin, when the waitress told us that we could order half orders of just about anything on the menu - the cost was half of the menu price + 50 cents.  We did that instead, order half an omelette and half an order of grilled banana bread french toast. So I said - well, we won't need the other muffin, but the waitress said - no charge! - I'll bring you an extra anyway.. . The food was excellent. The breakfast potatoes need some work - they were just hard fried "bits" of potatoes - but everything else was great.  A carafe of coffee was left on our table so that we didn't have to keep asking for refills, and cream/flavored creamers are on the table to make a perfect cup of coffee.. . It was delightful - a trip back in time!  Don't miss it if you have a car in LV!
It's a very busy place always crowded but it's well worth the wait. The last time I came I only waited 10 minutes which was shocking I usually wait 20-30 because how crowded it is. The customer service Is pleasing for a busy place! They always make you feel welcome. Their potatoes has to be one of the best things there. What ever I order I make sure the item comes with potatoes or I get them in the side. If you are a fan of banana but muffins then you will honestly love theirs. Always moist and fresh out the oven. I've been to Egg works which is the same business but for some reason I prefer the Egg and I more.
Yelp did not fail us on this one! The food and service was awesome! The whole restaurant was packed but we only had to wait for about 10mins until we were seated. Everyone at our table ordered something different and they were all delicious. . . I'm very satisfied with their service! Although it was super busy, our server Ashley picked up on things we were mumbling to ourselves, thinking she would ignore us like any other server would on a busy day but she didn't, and got our request right away, which was nice. . . I got the Sunrise Mountain which was eggs, cheese, a choice of meat on top of a fluffy croissant. Served with their delicious seasoned potato bits! Yum! Definitely recommend this one if you love cheese an eggs! It is also a very reasonable price and perfect portions.. . I'm definitely going to return for breakfast when I'm in Vegas!
The Egg and I is our favorite place for breakfast when we visit Las Vegas. The food and service is always good. But this time our waitress Ashley H. made it even more enjoyable. She was extremely personable and helpful .My  husband and I always share because the portions are very generous. But we always have to compromise because we each want something different. Ashley informed us about the dishes that we can get half portions of. So now there is no need to share. We can each get what we want. Everything on the menu is great. So be adventurous and  try something different.
If you can get off the strip, you need to try the breakfast here. Staci was our server and she helped to make this a great dining experience.  She was friendly, helpful and professional. I ordered the pulled pork taquito, served with eggs on the top. Oh my, this was delicious and humongous. It served with a green salsa which I don't normally like but this was good. If you like a little Mexican with your brunch this is a dish worth trying. My partner had the homemade corned beef hash.  Also delicious, big chunks of meat. The meal started with their muffins. So Good, I wish we saved one for later.
First...amazing banana muffins.  Simply delicious.  The food is great with a large number of options.  Staci, our server, was an amazing server.  I watched her explain items to us, as well as others.  She was very attentive and personable.   The only issues I would have are these.  1) I wanted a pancake and they only have large portions and no option for a single normal pancake to add to the side of a large omlet.  2) the potatoes were very salty...tasty...but too salty.  I don't mind a bit odd salt or spuce...but these were over the top with salt.. . Great place for a nice breakfast.. . Give Staci the trip to Disneyland!
Our server Staci was awesome, and made us feel cared for as guests.  I appreciated that she asked whether we wanted full amount of cheese on the omelette or butter on the toast, as it's nice to be made aware of some healthier changes to the food when dining in Vegas.  I took one star off for the potatoes that were too salty to eat, but otherwise everything else was great.  I had the veggie omelette with added avocado and banana nut muffin.
Stacie did a great job serving us. Delicious potatoes!!! We'll be back on our next trip to LV
Stacie is the best.  Great service, amazing muffins!  Tons of muffins, great for the trip home.  The pricing is beyond fair especially for the portions.  Killer eggs Benedict!
Such a well crafted chicken country steak, amazeballz. Ashley was key to the deliciousness, loved everything she served, including splitting my bread order in 2. Got the sour dough and rye. Non nom nom
I've been here since Monday and today is Wednesday FINNALLY some real good food! Chicken fried steak cooked to perfection gravy was on point and the potatoes works were seasoned and cooked just right! My husband got the egg sausage bacon and toast SOO GOOD!! Oh and the banana nut muffin!! YUM!!! . . I definitely recommend this place for the perfect breakfast!
I know this place can do without another 5 star review, but I think I want to move to Vegas just for Egg & I. We came in a group of 10, but service blew our minds away. At 1 pm on a Saturday, we barely waited 10 minutes. Our server took our orders quickly, and gave everyone a banana nut muffin on the house!. . A couple of my friends and I split the blackened prime rib benedict (a must must MUST!), the strawberry cream-stuffed french toast (tasted like fair food), and an Italian omelette. Enormous portions priced right--felt so bad leaving so much of it uneaten, especially since it was so delish. Even the coffee was the absolute perfect diner coffee.. . I don't think I can ever do a Vegas trip without the Egg & I. It's so worth the drive off the strip! And believe the hype--just stick to the blackened prime rib benny and you won't be disappointed.
Ashley was such a sweet server. The service is great & the place is well kept. They have so many choices here & cater to many different likes even though it is a breakfast joint. The potatoes are greatttttttt. Love it here!
I went here last year and wasn't super impressed. I don't remember exactly what I got, but I think it was an omelette. Decent, but I didn't see what all the fuss was about and especially for a place that isn't cheap. Well, I'm glad I tried it again, because now I see more of what people have been talking about. I went with a party of 8 and the service was excellent. Someone recommended the stuffed French toast and although it didn't really sound like my kind of thing I ordered it. Well, I'm glad I did because that thing is awesome! Perfectly cooked eggs with the right amount of cheese and sausage. The French toast was done just right as well. So, I suppose it really depends on what you have here and what your tastes are. For example, I tried those muffins everyone at our table was raving about and I didn't like them. Go figure!
Gets packed around 10. You can call ahead to get your name on the list, but they will only  honor it for 30 minutes in advance. The banana nut muffin is delicious with coffee. The potatoes were also delicious because of the seasoning they used. Service was friendly and fast. I recommend their original breakfast burrito.
Okay, first of all, wen you have a bunch of the hostess' and servers arguing with eachother that should be a bad sign of things to come, which it was. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait which turned I to an hour as we saw several larger parties that came after us get seated. Apparently they'd rather seat the larger "more valuable" customers as one hostess mumbled to another as we sat there. Pissed me the hell off! Who're... We finally got seated and it took and other 45 minutes to get our gross food. Go to VI or even Jack in the Box for a better breakfast, this place is diarrhea.
The reviews for this location are misleading.  This place is dirty. The center railing doesn't get wiped we sat next to dust and insects.  Expect a long wait and minimal customer service. The hostess was probably the most pleasant worker there. I didn't even touch my cup of water, the cup wasn't clean. Won't be back to this location.
Food was so good. I ordered the Country Fried Steak,very filling and tasted great. Lindsey are server was great as well.
Great place to have breakfast.  Fast and friendly service.  Arlene was very courteous and attentive. Hefty servings at a reasonable price.
AMAZING, amazing experience here. The food and service was top notch here. They were able to accommodate our party of 10. Regardless of our party size, they provided amazing service. We gave them a big fat tip. Their banana nut muffins were to die for and possibly the best one I've ever had. I got the spinach benny and it was delicious. The other foods looked good and none of us had any complaints during our meal. I think I will need to visit this place every time I'm in Vegas. It's delicious with amazing service. Can't go wrong!
$ Service was excellent. Veggie Benny was large with fresh vegetables and excellent Hollandaise sauce.
I think it's really funny that I had no idea this place is the same as Egg Works. I probably wouldn't have came here had I known because I didn't much like Egg Works off of Rainbow. . . Surprisingly I thought the food and the service here at Egg & I were much more acceptable then Egg works. Boy was it busy though, I hate waiting outside...it's too damn hot in Vegas. Besides sitting in the heat waiting to be seated, I enjoyed the rest of my experience here. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the food was good (not amazing).
It would've been good but they forgot my order. So I had to wait. The waitress did apologize and comp our meals but we took it to go and I lost my appetite. I missed my friend finishing her marathon.
It was okay nothing special...pancakes were dry didn't eat it. Got that with bacon eggs and potatoes and toast! The staff was good friendly, it took a while for the food to come out but it was expected for a Sunday. Food wasn't terrible but I wouldn't come back.
