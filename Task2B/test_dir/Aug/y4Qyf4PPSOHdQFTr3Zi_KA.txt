We visit often, however, we have yet to stay the night since we are locals andprices are a bit high. Red rock is beautiful inside and has all of our favorites including great restaurants, great bands play at the venues, and bowling. Lucille's and Yard House are top restaurants here. Parking is always a breeze and everyone is soo nice :-)
I say I come here every year for one confernce and that is hip hop international. Which happens usually around august of every year. This hotel resort has enough space to house over 50 teams from all over the world who compete for the gold medal. Lots of nice views from the pool and cafe and buffets all around. The pool area is fantastic and beautiful. Make sure to bring your bathingsuit but they provide you with towels.  Eat drink, and gamble.

It is Friday August 8 2014 and I am at the Red Rock for the Hip Hop Championships. Checked in to my kids' room yesterday and was told that the adjoining room for my husband and myself would be ready early this morning after 11 am check out. I ended up waiting the entire day for the room after calling and visiting the front desk more than 5 times only to find at 4:30 pm that the room was still occupied by the previous night's guests! A detailed account of my experience is below but suffice it to say that 5 staff members throughout the day decided that this very important detail was not worth mentioning even when I expressed concern because the guests next door were obviously partying late into the night.. . It could be a very nice hotel if it had better customer service.. . The plus side:. -lots of restaurants. -relaxing modern dark brown color scheme. -nice pool. -security dealt with a loud noise issue immediately when I called to complain. . The negatives:. -not the best housekeeping (dusty room). -can't recommend the Grand Cafe - water glasses smell like my dog when she needs a bath and the waitress could not give us correct info about the menu and didn't get our order right. The coffee was also terrible.. -front desk staff does not provide accurate information. . I hope this review helps someone make a decision about the hotel, but more importantly, I hope that it helps the hotel improve on their customer service.. . . Details of my room issue:. . Went to front desk after noon and asked about the status. Told that the room was not ready yet and to check back later. They said they would put a "rush" on the room. Went back at 2:30pm and was told again the room was not ready. Since I was awakened at 3:00 am by loud laughing and other "strange" noises from the adjoining room, I was concerned and asked if there was a problem. Was told that they only knew the room was not yet cleaned and that they would call my cell phone when it was available. I asked if I could check in and just come down to get the keys when it was ready, they said no. Went back to wait in my kids room.. . At 3:20pm (past check in time) I decided to call the front desk and was told that the room was not yet ready. I asked again if there was a problem and told them that I wanted to unpack and use the shower. I was told that I would get a call when it was ready.. . At 4:00 pm I called again and spoke to Minnie. She said that the room was not ready but that I had to come downstairs to "pre-check" in. I explained that I was told earlier that I could not check in until the room was ready. She said she would check and call me back. I asked her to please call back within 10 minutes since I was tired of waiting in the kids' room. She promised she would.. . At 4:15, still no call but I heard a knock on the door of the adjoining room. Opened my door to see a housekeeper standing at the door. I asked her if the room was ready. She said she was checking - she opened the door, quickly closed it, and said that "they" were still there. "They" were obviously the loud guests from the night before.. I hurried downstairs to complain that no one had bothered to tell me that the guests from the previous night had not yet left. If I had known that, I would have asked them to get me another room instead of waiting for 4 hours in my kids room thinking I would get a call any minute to check in.. . Maria, an assistant manager, apologized and gave me another room but she said that there were no adjoining rooms available for my kids. By this time I am exhausted waiting for my room and for my shower so I take the room, despite the fact that my kids are still in a room next to people who party (loudly) late into the night. Called Patrick Wallace, the manager twice to ask him to call me about the problem but no response yet.
A favorite local's casino! . . The casino floor layout is easy to navigate, staff is friendly and helpful, and they have a great sports book.. . There are plenty of dining options, and entertainment options as well, they have a nice movie theater and huge bowling alley.
I've been here for Sunday Brunch and was not disappointed, the brunch was great.  This time I came to stay!. . The room was nice, the view of the Strip in the distance was really nice.  It was a long walk from the elevator to the room however.. . Spacious room, spacious bathroom, nice work area.  Parking was quick and easy.  The hotel has one place to valet the car, the casino another.  So, unlike many casinos you do not have to check in and walk through the casino to get to the rooms.  What a nice touch!. . Upshot:  this is a great place to stay off the Strip.  The Strip is so difficult to navigate these days, spots like the Red Rock are where to go.
****DO NOT BOOK HERE IF YOU NEED SPECIFIC ROOM TYPE**** . . I have never felt compelled to write a review good or bad until this weekend. We booked 8 double rooms for 3 nights each. To make a long story short, 3 of the rooms were moved to kings because they were oversold on doubles.  Having worked in the hospitality industry for over 20 years, I understand that these situations happen. What I don't understand is why Red Rock did not make any effort  to rectify their mistake.  The front desk agents continually lied to me stating that we had a double room and it was just not ready, the Manager on Duty had no empathy for our situation, took no accountability for what happened, offered zero solutions (how did they expect a family of 4 to sleep in one king bed???) and no one from upper management followed up with me. . And we weren't the only ones whose reservations were not being honored. There were plenty of other families at the front desk experiencing what we were going through that day.. . To make matters worse, found out that other friends who checked in after us got doubles, someone who checked in night after was bumped from king to a double (they couldn't follow up with anyone in a king to see if they wanted to move so someone didn't have to sleep on floor?) and others were given financial compensation. . . We've stayed for 3 years in a row.  Each year someone we know has had a similar experience. Guess we're slow learners and our luck finally wore out. We will NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone again. . . The kids love this hotel so it's a shame that this happened the way it did. Also this year the pool water was exceptionally dirty: water was not clear, cups, plastic ware and wads of phlegm floating around us. . . So if you still book here after reading this and don't get the room type you reserved, don't say I didn't warn you.
Do not stay here. I reserved two rooms at this hotel for my family based on the positive reviews on yelp. It was horrible. 1) High resort fees on two rooms, 2) the rooms were spacious but they smelled of vomit and tobacco and they gave us only one towel per room, 3) our room was not ready until 6:00 pm and the pool closed at 8:00 pm, 4) the rooms were far apart from each other, 5) only one elevator worked with hundreds of teens at a conference riding up and down, 6) too far from the strip, 7) no vending and ice machines, 8) no prices on in-room refrigerator, and 9) the place was like O'Hare airport. It was not relaxing. When I complained to the desk, they apologized and said they had a lot of kids this weekend. Unbelievable. I will never stay here again.
Awful customer service. Arrived at 4:00 pm (check in 3:00) and room was not ready. Came back at 5:00 and room still not ready. There was a 10 minute wait for each desk trip. Was given another room which had dirty dishware outside that stayed until the next day. Bags of laundry were also in the hallway for several hours. . . First night I used the bathtub and it took forever to drain and the faucet dripped all night. I put a towel in to muffle the sound. Next night I used the shower and the faucet handle fell off!  Told the desk at checkout and she said "thank you."  Really? I don't think she even apologized. . . Checked with the hotel desk checkout morning for the airport shuttle time. 12:00 she said. Perfect. Come down to get the shuttle but it left at 11:00. To get to the airport I now have to pay almost $60 before tip as the next shuttle leaves at 1:00. . . For $100+ a night, your money is better spent at Caesars or the Venetian where the hotel and service are impeccable.
Having stayed 4 nights with an initial problem described in my first review, I have to say that there are definitely some pluses but the customer service at the front desk is still abysmal. Checking out, not one person smiled at any customer, there were no "I hope you enjoyed your stay" or "Please come back soon" type of comments to be heard. These are, IMO, essential service points at any hotel. . . On the plus side, the service when calling through the room operator is good, hangers brought up quickly, electrical issues resolved smoothly. Also, the movie theater and food court come in very handy for good entertainment and quick snacks. Valet parking attendants are courteous.. . Improving front desk service, fixing the slow elevators, and adding coffee/water in rooms would bring this hotel up to the level of other hotels I've used in Las Vegas like the Signature MGM and The Venetian.
I am a fan of a Red Rock Casino until this recent visit. I am writing this as my husband is driving us out of the resort. I purchased the Family Package which includes a minimum 2 night stay, 4 free bowling games, and 4 movie tickets. As I checked in the front desk advised that their process changed on the movie tickets and that I was to ask for the movie theater to charge to the room. So we went and planned to watch a movie, waited in line and got to the purchasing window only to be embarassed in that they had no idea what I was talking about and they were not able to charge to the room. I called the Front Desk was placed on hold for 18 minutes while she called the movie theater to clear things up. Never getting back to the line after 20 minutes I disconnected and called again - placed on hold for another 10 minutes as i requested a manager - then another 15 minutes. FINALLY after 45 minutes manager MARIA came on the line said they could not do anything about the movie tickets and advised me to pay myself. She stated she would reduce my nightly rate by $50/night to cover for the 4 movie tickets ($44) and my inconvenience. I asked to confirm that this would be done for both nights and she confirmed. CHECK OUT TIME! So RED Rock AGAIN could not honor their word and the $50 credit was only applied to 1night as movie tickets are only $44 and i should be happy with their $6 credit for my inconvience and poor cusomer service and FALSE advertisement. Such a poor approach to customer service from a great place. Thanks for ruining my vacation Red Rock.
Great Buffet, bowling alley feels state of the art. this place has restaurant selection and quality rivaling anywhere in vegas. if you play poker like me. best poker room off the strip.always recommend it to my out of town friends.
This review is solely based on the poker room. The games are nitty, there are annoying locals who think they are better than everyone else. Basically this is where poker players go to die. Also, the NL Hold'em games are 10-handed (versus most poker rooms where they are 9-handed) which perpetuates the nittiness. Staff is super cool though. Come here if you just want to play ABC poker against a bunch of short stacking nits.
This casino is very good looking both on the outside with fire and fountains and on the inside with chandeliers and grand carpets. The movie theater is nice and clean. The bowling alley is also top notch, and I know they host professional bowling tournaments there as well. There's a food court as well as top notch restaurants for dining and an arcade for kids. The Red Rock is one of my favorites.
Came here for a sales conference. Great resort with everything available on the property. . . Be aware that red rock is not anywhere near the strip.
This is a great, wonderful place...overall.  As long as the music in the casino, which filters into the buffet, is so loud that you can't hear yourself think and it distracts from all other experiences within, then I have to give it three stars instead of five.
Horrible service. Lance ( Security- right across from the cashiers booth there's a security booth, that's where his cage is). He needs to get a course on client service and learn how to speak to human beings. . He's absolutely horrible.
Great place to take the family. They have bowling alley, movie theater, kids quest so adults can have adult time & a great pool area. Also shopping places across the way...
This resort is one of the nicest places I have been in a while. The staff was pleasant and very friendly. The decor was amazing. I will never stay on the strip again. I am definitely coming back for New Years!!
A Station brand casino, so bring them Station related perks cards and the Station buffet coupons(but not resort specific coupons)! Buffet was great and liked it a lot better than Santa Fe. Poker Room staff were all nice and place was clean, meaning it didnt reek of stale nicotine...just yet :) Cocktail staff were great in getting the orders. There are other aspects of the hotel I have yet to experience, hence only the 4 stars for now.
We were pretty impressed with the room and overall layout of the hotel. We asked for late checkout at Noon the night before and as we were leaving, we were commenting about how we would return... . Until...Check-out time is 11 am, the housekeeper started banging on the door at 11:05, and proceeded to come into the room. I had just gotten out of the shower and was trying my best to close the door and tell her we had late checkout. She said I did not and had to leave.. . Two minutes later the housekeeper called me to tell me she verified I did not have late checkout and shouted at me, saying I was being charged and then slammed the phone.. . Housekeepers calling guests about charges?? . . We spent a majority of the hour talking to various managers from different departments, repeating the story about 20 times  with no outcomes.. . The hotel was not willing to support us, demanding we leave at 1 pm and said they would "look into the incident".  . . I have never experienced a  security breach from a  hotel  like  this before, and intend to take this  to a higher level.We  called the Director of Hotel. Operations, Paulo D and have not heard from him several days later. We have yet to receive an apology.
The Rock is the best local casino on the West side.  Clean and staff is friendly.  The buffet is great and there's a non-smoking section of games.  This is a great date night spot or great to bring out of town guests!
