Oh man... DON'T get me started with TAO night club. ARGH, so I came here with 5 girls total to TAO waiting for the rest of our bachelorette party.. . 2 of the girls parted ways after only 10 mins of being there and then there was 3. The 3 of us started drinking at the bar/restaurant area first before we went back up to the main club. Once in, it was PACKED... I mean you're lucky if there are tiny spots where you can BREATHE a little and have some room, but other than that, NO ROOM!. . The main dance floor area WAS PACKED. SO PACKED that it was unbearable because you couldn't dance... . . Bouncers there were rude and kept belly bumpin me thinking I was going to go under the velvet ropes to a table... which I wasn't ... argh all in all. I really don't like TAO NIGHT CLUB! I wished I was able to go to a better "EDM"-ish night club during my stay in Vegas, but I didn't have enough time to do that... Only upside was that Cash Cash was playing on the weekend of 7/26 so that was nice... . . Other than that, I don't think I'll be returning to TAO!
It use to be good, not a fan any more the other clubs on the las vegas strip offer more, not as upscale as the staff thinks it is. It is not really that fun anymore.
I had such a blast here! It was one of my girlfriends birthday so we each pitched in and got VIP & Bottle Service. May I add, it was super super expensive BUT it was totally worth it. We would never experience a  club atmosphere as wild as Tao, so we definitely put in our moneys worth. The club promoter that we went through was very nice and kept in touch with us right away and never kept us waiting. We got in easily. I definitely recommend this club, I had a blast!
Tao is my favorite Vegas club. . . I love the Asian theme. . . If you get a promoter, it is usually free for guys and girls and girls get free drinks for an hour. . . The reason I love this club is because they play a good mix of music. The other LV clubs play nonstop unce all night. I cannot stand that. I need to here words in my music!!!. . They closed the beach area. It was open the last time I came here. . . Even though Tao is one of the old school spots, it is still an awesome club!
Thank you Timothy!. . Comped drinks, appetizers, and open bar for our bachelorette party!. . come early as it does get crowded. . if you are a group of fine girls get up on the catwalk and dance in the relatively ample space up there!  . . when the DJ comes out it changes from 90's hip hop to EDM, then they start passing how those big foamy glow sticks...sweet!. . my advice: come early so you can get some good dancing in and enjoy different music.
This place is definitely overrated. Not worth all the hype. . You're better off trying to get on someone's guest list and getting there early or you'll have to wait in a ridiculous line. . The music is okay. Just okay. The dj was repeating songs. Who does that??. The place is Sooo crowded that you can't really find a place to stand or sit. And when you finally do settle somewhere the bouncers are quick to tell you what you're doing wrong. You just can't do anything or stand anywhere. We ended up hanging out on the smoking patio most of the time bc it was the only place we could stand without being told to move. Don't waste your time. There are PLENTY of better WAAAY better nightclubs than this. Check out Drais at the Cromwell. THAT place knows what's up.
Where do I start. I must say I have never had such horrible service at a night club. We did the dinner/vip package off a recommendation of my sister in law who had a great time. This was our first time at this club and I will say my LAST. . . Dinner started off great, service was good, food was good. Even when a waiter dropped a whole tray of dishes right behind us and I got sprayed with chili sauce all over my arm and face and all over the back of another person in our party. Mamagement came over and was very attenative and offered to pay our dry cleaning bill, or our bill, or drinks. We had already paid for dinner so we took the round of drinks . No biggie there. . . We finally get escorted up by Nick  to the line where we were then handed off to another person whowalked us into the club to our table. We were placed at a table that was in what our hostest called  the "Opium" room. Everything was going well, we were having fun till they started moving all the parties from that room over to the main clib area. Our hostest and security guard would come up and say okay they have a table for you and are gonna move you now... than another party would be moved. This happened the whole night till we were the last table in the opium room. Seriously, tao come on. When someone pays for vip service you shouldn't treat them like they were just someone who hasnt speant as much as we did.. . . After a bouncer came over to see what the issue was and me and him getting into it we finally got moved. They stick us in a booth that clearly other people had just left and they didnt bother to clean up. There was liquid all over the floor along with drink straws. They didnt wipe the table or thr benches down. My best friend was wearing a white dress and sat down in something that got all over her dress... . . I complained again to our hostest who said she was going to get the manager. Yet the manager never showed up. Never did any busers or anyone to clean up the mess at the booth. Not til my best friend tweeted and tagged tao in her post about how dirty the booth was and how unsatisfied she was with our experience was did we get people to clean up the booth.  After that we never saw a hostest, security, or person from the club.  I tried to forget about the troubles from earlier and just have a good time. Random people would sit in our booth or in the booths next to us and then ask for drinks. . . For the amount of money we spent I would have thought the service would have been a lot better. I was so disappointed and would never again go to Tao. Don't waste your money!!!!
Front staff annoyed me. They have about 3 girls they look like they're 16 or 17. Have no customer service skills or communication skills. I asked her a simple question about the open bar she had no fucking idea how to answer my question. Security guard total asshole. Not to mention they only accept cash.
Loved this club.  Great set up.  Crowded but what do you expect from a Vegas club on the weekend.  Service was good.  Smoking area was a little tight but other than that definitely coming back.
we had a large group of 15 people, i think there were 9 girls and 6 guys. im not sure how but we all got in free, which was awesome. the music was great, there were multiple floors with different music. my only knock is that the bar on the top floor was way too crowd, not enough bartenders. i order a few greygoose and cranberries, they were mixed well. we didn't stay for long but i enjoyed my time there. if you're going here, make sure you pay extra for bottle service and a booth to avoid the crowded area near the bartenders.
I was staying at the Venetian and decided to check this place out since it is conveniently located in the hotel. There was a line outside when we got there but the bouncer moved us up to the front since we brought the promotional card given to us by the hotel. Inside was packed full of people  with a good ratio of men and women. They had half naked models in bath tubs in the center, which I thought was pretty interesting. The drinks were well made and strong. I didn't really like the music too much since it was a lot of hip hop but I think it really just depends on the night and the DJ. I still had a good time here. Check it out especially if you are staying at the Venetian.
Very bad!
two words: CASEY COMBS!!!  He HOOKED US UP!  We went for my nephew's 21st bday.  Got an awesome price for table service and an optimal spot!!!  Bottle pricing was reasonable and the music was pretty good.  The best part was the service!  He was patient as I tried to gather my party of mostly under 25 year olds and really just treated us well.  The staff was patient and friendly.  LOVE IT!!!!
I literally had one of the funnest nights ever here at Tao! I've been wanting to check out the place forever, so when we planned our recent trip to Las Vegas, I knew it was going to be a must-do! We went through a promoter, who was so awesome. He got the 6 of us comp entry and told us the best time to arrive so the girls could take advantage of the open bar. Getting in was a breeze. The place is beautiful! Extremely well kept. It was sooo packed, but understandably. It was a Saturday night. The bartenders were nice, which I've never ever experienced in a club before. Lol. The DJ was phenomenal, kept us dancing all night! The bathrooms weren't so clean, but I guess it's hard to keep it clean with drunkards everywhere. There was an awesome photo booth for free pics, the balcony had a great view..literally everything about this place blew me away! Exceeded my expectations for sure!!
This is a huge club.  Got pushed around a lot.  I never party in Vegas so I don't really know what to expect.  . . Anyways, I met Mark Salling from Glee the night I went!  :)  I wanted to share that.. . It was cool.  Music was good.  I liked the human disco ball dancing.  I didn't drink so can't comment on that.
I was at the club for the memorial weekend.  And no apparent reason I got kicked out. Then they gave me the run around just to find their supervisor. Spend your money on some where less resist
