My favorite AYCE sushi spot in Vegas. It's located off the strip, so it's not as hectic. It's in the "ghetto" side but in all honesty, the area isn't THAT bad. It might look a bit sketch, but the food here is amazing. I always get the nigiri and some handrolls. My girlfriend opts for their sushi rolls and nigiri. Service here is also good. Waitresses are always attentive to your needs. . . A must-try is their Palm Job handroll. It's only limited to 1 per customer. I also get the other items that are restricted to 1 per person such as uni. Bonus: if your significant other does not eat it, you'd get 2 orders! #win
Still my favorite place in town for AYCE. Another 5 star review, 4 years later. My last review, was just about spicy tuna, laaame. . . Lunch $21.95, and Dinner $24.95. I have honestly never had a wait... even on a Friday or Saturday evening... So maybe I'm lucky, or maybe I come at irregular dinner hours (6pm... isn't so irregular) Don't worry yourself over a wait. As for feeling like a cramped sardine, yes you will be jam packed into this place. Ask for a table on the new side to the right of the bar if it is open, much more spacious. . . Here's how to do it at Yama: Get a table, yes a table. I feel I get better and more efficient service at a table (waiters have notepads so you can stack your orders, while a chef only has his memory). My water is always filled to the top, sometimes I will ask them not to, and don't get alcohol unless you want to compromise your stomach's capacity for food;) . . Next step is nigiri, (you come to a sushi restaurant, no cooked food here, skip the boring appetizers!) 2 pieces come with one order. If you're feeling it you can go for the seafood salad (sashimi in a ponzu type sauce, you get what I think is the left over cuts), this is a hit or miss with me. It's good, but I definitely don't come here just for that. What you must have is garlic tuna and the yellow tail. . . After nigiri comes rolls. Number 7- "sun of a beach" is a must! A MUST. Hits every sensation and taste: hot, cold, crunchy, sweet, spicy. Yes its smothered in sauce, which "snobs" seem to dislike, but just get it. I am also a big fan of "wet dream," its baked so it takes a little while for it to come out, and has a healthy dosage of cream cheese. Keep note, if you're feeling full but want to continue to try, you can order a half roll.. . And to top it off, no matter how full you are, dessert is a must. Mango or strawberry mochi will soothe the heat of your wasabi, and creates a great end cap to the meal. Enjoy!
I love this place! I have been coming here for 4 years and it has consistently been a great experience. Food is good quality, people give great service and remember us and our orders. Well worth the $25 all you can eat. Elixir is always amazing with the seafood salads. With out fail I order a wet dream and i am always satisfied. Even my brother who hates sushi is now a regular!
This is our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!. Me and my boyfriend dine in here every time we come to Vegas and it is always good!. With only $22 you can try a variety of food which are very tasty, definitely worth it ! Rolls are really good! "One minute man" is our favorite! Service is good too the waiters are friendly they never keep you waiting too long.. We went to the top rated buffet in Caesar Palace later the day, and still thought this place has better sushi rolls. Will definitely come back again!
After disappointing start at Kaya Sushi, we returned to Yama Sushi, the quality is top notch, the servers are nice. Service is quick, and the atmosphere is clean. I love it. Will return!!!!
This is THE BEST sushi place in Las Vegas HANDS DOWN. I make it a point to eat here at least once a month. It's located off the strip so it's pretty much locals only. This is nice because you don't have to deal with the drunk tourists who wander around. It can get extremely crowded, and if you have a large party you will probably have to work. It's worth it!  The rolls are delicious and fresh. If you like Uni, this is the place to go. You can only get one order per person though so make it count!. . For rolls, I recommend the Man Whore and Salmon Loves Lemon rolls. They do have a lot of choices though, so there is something for everyone. I try to try a new roll every time. You can even order a half roll which can be the perfect size when you are starting to get full! . . I'm sad that I moved away from Las Vegas and won't get to eat at Yama. But I'll make sure to stop by every time I'm there!
Always great!!  Super fresh and for some reason the water is sooo good lol.  I highly recommend this place.
Found my new favorite sushi spot! This place is always packed when I go. With people waiting outside for tables. But if your fine dining at the bar, you might not even have to wait. (Besides, AYCE is best at the bar). They have an amazing seafood salad. You have to try it. It sounds kind of weird, but literally amazing. The restaurant seems a little crammed also, but maybe because its always so busy. Overall, its a great restaurant. Servers and chefs are so friendly. Some chefs are hilarious also! Definitely a place to try!
Back at Yama Sushi again, figure it's time to finally review them. I love sushi and have hit a few different spots around town, Yama is still my favorite. I appreciate the variety of cooked/cold (raw) rolls. My love for cream  cheese runs deep and I have SO many cream cheese filled rolls to pick from it's perfect! We usually sit at a table but this time we went for the bar, I have to say I like the bar better(except for the idiot and his girlfriend with spilled sushi all over seated next to us, but I digress) My favorites are always the Harry Potter, Wet Dream, Be Mine,  and Yo Sexy. My only complaints are the location. Location, location, location. I sincerely wish this place was in another part of town, maybe they'll move someday. Otherwise I'll continue to eat here...just during daylight.
One of the best sushi place in Las Vegas! Seriously delicious and amazing service!! They have so many kinds of rolls and options to choose from. We arrived with a big party and they situated us as soon as possible and our waiter was on top of everything. It was the best!
I just had dinner here and was extremely disappointed with service AND food. If the service isn't great, I would hope the food would be good. We ordered the AYCE and they had our order forgotten our order three times. They put too much rice with a weird texture that makes eating a whole roll a daunting task. There are better restaurants for a cheaper price and better service.
This is the first sushi place I come to in Vegas, but I can say I was not impressed. Price of 24 all u eat per person is fair, but I rather pay a little bit more to have more quality fish sushi. "Man whore" sushi is good, but the plate comes with 8 pieces and its really oily and cheesy... So I could only have one. Anyway, good service.
I love this place to death like literally. Oh man where should I start lol ever since the day I came to this place to try it out for myself, I think a whole week straight I couldn't stop ranting about how delicious everything is on the menu. Hands down one of my favorite sushi place in Vegas ;)
Best sushi in town, well worth the 30min wait!! Service is great, the only thing is that it gets crowded but very good all around
Service is always great . And the food is delicious definitely one of my favorite places for sushi
Sushi eaters listen up -  don't listen to reviews that say the sushi here is delicious/fresh/the best they've ever had. Ok? Those people are obviously mid-westerners or teenagers or something. Listen to me I'm pushing 30, I grew up in San Francisco, recently moved to vegas, grew up in family-owned restaurant for 25 years. DO NOT expect the sushi here to be "very good", yeah? the cold food is totally acceptable though and probably won't make you sick. The hot food is definitely alright. For a buffet, it is good.. . Anyway, If the end of the meal (meaning dessert) wasn't so horribly disappointing I would have felt pretty good about my experience here.. . We went for the dinner buffet. They have good hot food. For being a sit down buffet the rolls and sushi is average buffet quality, not a whole heck of a lot of flavor.. . The amount of time it takes for them to come to take your order, the time it takes for them to make and deliver, and the table space makes it so that you can't overeat to the point of sickness. . . weekday dinner is $24/pp (not including tax or tip), includes hot green tea, other drinks not included. . . The desserts choices SUCK (ice cream or mochi, thats it). As in green tea ice cream that has literally no green tea flavor in it. Beware, the plum ice cream IS bubble gum ice cream with frozen plums in it - gross - is that what plum ice cream is supposed to taste like? Chocolate mochi was good but you're only allowed one mochi per person!!. . Their desserts pissed me off.. . If the owner cares to read this, which I don't think they do since this place is obviously really busy and probably has no need to change anything, if dessert is too expensive for you guys can you at least do some like creamy goji soup, or pudding, or just better quality ice cream please? Even cookies will do!. . If you had good desserts you might get a 5-star from me, for sure a solid 4.
Been here twice and was pleased both times. The prices for AYCE is great! Would recommend.
LOVE. IT. HERE.  Yes, ok, it's pretty busy, but we go for late lunch and we can always sit right down.  Sitting at the bar is fun too, because the chefs will through some great stuff at you that you don't even order!  . . I like that you can just order whatever.  There are so many amazing rolls - it's neat to experiment with them!  The seaweed salad is phenomenal - I could eat that all day!  . . The staff was great - they picked up a plate from me and some sauce spilled on my dress, 3 staff members, including the owner came over and scrubbed my dress clean - it was quite cute actually.  . . If you are looking for a fun place to eat, you want VARIETY, and you want good sushi - this is the place to go.  We go every time we are in town!!
Still my favorite sushi spot in town. I don't know how they do it. Maybe it's because they have a million servers on the floor, and a bunch of sushi chefs behind the bar, but service is always on point. Rolls come out quickly and I never have to wait long for drinks to be refilled or dirty dishes to be cleared. . . So I always start with the seafood salad, although the portions have gotten smaller. I don't get any soup or  appetizers because I'm just there for the rolls. I really enjoy the sun of the beach, wet dream, snow in Vegas, and no name rolls. Yes they are saucy, but that's what makes em' good! I really wish they would open another restaurant because they are always busy! I went Thursday night around 8 and there was still a 20 minute wait. Honestly though, that was nothing. I've waited an hour before because this place is absolutely worth the wait.
Yama Sushi has excellent service, fresh sushi, and reasonable-sized servings.  I went for dinner around 5:30 and my friend and I were seated right away.  We both opted for all-you-can-eat sushi for $26.95, which was a reasonable deal for the amount of sushi we eat!. . What I like about Yama Sushi is that the size of the servings is PERFECT!  The sushi is not overly filled, and you can even order half-orders if you want to try several different rolls!  Many other all-you-can-eat sushi places try to fill you up and only allow you to order a couple of rolls before you literally have to roll out of the restaurant.  Yama Sushi is not like that.. . Additionally, the servers were extremely friendly and helpful here!  I was asking the server if they had a california roll topped with spicy tuna, and she said it was not on the menu, but the chef would be happy to make it!  The servers were always present to refill our water and ask us if we wanted to order anything new.. . Although the quality of the sushi is fresh and delicious here, they did not offer as large or unique of a selection as other sushi restaurants.  Yes, I know the names are unique, but looking beyond that... The only sushi I distinctly remember eating here was the "Yo Mama," and that was my absolute favorite roll!. . All in all, I would definitely return to this restaurant because of the convenience of the half-order rolls and the accommodating service.  However, it was not the best sushi I've had in Las Vegas.
I don't know how this place has 4 stars. I've given it a try a couple times since it's near UNLV and cheaper than most AYCE places but nothing redeems this place of how below-average the sushi and service is. This place is crowded often but don't let it fool you, it's in a crowded area plus it's near the strip. The sushi is terrible. Their rice is always falling apart and the fish never tastes fresh. Plus their service is flat out rude. And if you don't want to take my word for it then take the Health District's word for it. THEY GOT CLOSED IN JUNE TWICE FOR FAILING THEIR HEALTH INSPECTION. And have gotten numerous C's in the past, many times getting over 30 demerits. Google it.. . The last time I went, when my friend and I arrived the hostess seemed peeved we were waiting for the rest of our party. We didn't even insist we sit down at a table but she had attitude about us waiting. When we got to our table it was 2:50 and they tried to charge us dinner prices which we had to fight them about. (And who wants to do that?) If your menu has lunch prices till 3PM then it's lunch prices till 3PM. Its not a hard concept. It's not like a buffet where we are trying to get lunch prices for a dinner buffet..it's the same shiz.  One last person arrived at 2:59 and they made a stink that HE absolutely had to pay the dinner price. Okay fine, take your extra 3 dollars you crazy people.. . Then we ate and I definitely didn't eat my moneys worth. Sushi looks like it's from a grocery store. Nothing special, tastes old.. . I'm sorry but when your sushi is gross don't be so determined to charge the higher price. They were rude about the whole process too and like I said, the sushi sucks.  The first time I went there they started bringing rolls no one ordered and when we said that they argued with us then and put it on our table anyway. This business does not know how to pick their battles or treat their customers. It's scary going to a sushi place like this because they WILL argue you for more money, even when they're clearly in the wrong. . . Sakana across the street is much better and relatively the same prices.
I mostly ordered Nigiri when I visited, the fish were not fresh at all.  We sat at the bar and the sushi chef were not very friendly; felt like I was asking for money when ordering sushi.  I think I would rather take my money and go to that Other place.
Best ayce sushi I have found in Vegas bar none.. . Usually a wait to get in, with good reason. They have very skilled staff and the sushi appears to be super fresh. Always very clean as well.. . Price is around 26.00 for dinner, great value.
This place is cheap , but for a few dollars more you can have MUCH better quality. This place is NOT good. If youre eating rolls, you can't tell what is inside, so youre fine. I only eat nigiri so I see the fish all too well. The first time I went here the tuna, which is usually a nice red color, was almost BROWN. I went another time to give them another chance, disappointed again. This is far from real Japanese food.
Love this place.  Visiting Vegas for a while now and just came upon this place whole staying here for a month.  Great Sushi at great price.  The all you can eat is a great deal.  Have eaten at high end Sushi in Vegas but this is my new favorite.
