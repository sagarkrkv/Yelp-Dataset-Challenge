Seriously. I come here so much for a good couple hours to study to abuse the real value of the Hibiscus iced tea with unlimited refills and munch on some home-made pastries, cookies, or whatever they make. I like to think that their food is home-made food, but with the slight disadvantage of missing the comfort of your PJ's. I wish I knew about this place before when I went to a certain girls college prep near here.... . Here's some hacks:. . It can get crowded, especially on Saturdays and Sundays for brunch. Come super super early (the ARE open a at 6, but 8 is a good time) for fresh-baked goodness. You can also come later, from 5:30 onwards night to avoid crowds and delicious options for dinner. . . Lux is open till 2AM on Friday and Saturday, and on every other day of the week, it is open till 12. (The bar is only open from midnight to 2 however, not the main stuff.). . You can ask for a dollop of Nutella with their fresh baked croissants. Perfect little breakfast. Also, their whipped cream is unique, dense, rich and amazing.. . I sometimes get a white hot chocolate, usually during the 'colder' months. It isn't on the menu, but you can ask for it. It's a delectable sweet treat, with perfect foam. :) . . Their hot teas really aren't that good, but their iced teas are great. You can get refills for their simple coffees, tea and their iced teas. It's probably a sin that I haven't been as interested in their coffee, since coffee gives me tummy aches. Alas. . . HOWEVER, PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THEIR FOOD IS GOOD!! Their food changes daily, so my rule of thumb is, if you see it and think you'll like it, get it, because you might not see it again for a while. Their delicate honey lavender shortbread haunts my sweet dreams.... . Go into Lux with an open heart and it will never fail you.
At long last, my first visit to Lux.  Located right across the street from Central High (my alma mater).  I'm not a coffee drinker, but was intrigued by the food and the atmosphere.  Not much for me to add to the numerous reviews about this place, but its pretty much as advertised.  Good food, quirky setup, crazy busy.  Its a coffee house first and foremost, but they also have a wine and cocktail bar.  Its a bakery that serves breakfast, but also has a lunch and dinner menu that changes regularly.  Sort of reminds me a little of La Grande Orange Grocery in that it has multiple personalities depending on the time of day.  Sometimes places that try to do everything well often don't do anything well.  But like LGO, this place is an exception.. . I came here on a Saturday morning around 7am.  My timing was perfect as the crowds started streaming in shortly thereafter.  Parking can be a chore as there's maybe 15 spaces in their main lot, so be prepared to park along Turney Ave (which also happens to be overflow parking for the apartment complex next door).  You walk up towards the front counter and get teased by a smorgasbord of tantalizing pastries and can also order off the menu on the wall.  The sweet dutch pancake with fruit intrigued me so I grabbed that.  Also got sides of their bacon and hash, since those also seemed to be feature breakfast items.  Along with an OJ, total price for breakfast with tax came to about $18.  You order up front and pay, then seat yourself and wait for the kitchen to call out your name.  I can see how this could be troublesome when its busy.  While there's plenty of seating in back, the front area can get crowded and noisy really fast making it difficult to hear your order called out or navigate the throngs of patrons.  Fortunately, no such trouble for me this morning as I got my food within 10 minutes of ordering.. . Sat down at the bar area up front (which is full stocked by the way).  The food was pretty solid.  The veggie hash was mostly potato, but you could pick up the carrots and other veggies mixed in.  The bacon was fantastic.  I'm not sure where they source it from, but the bacon strips were thick cut and the taste was nothing like your store brand bacon.  As for the pancake, mixed feelings on this.  A great assortment of fruit and they put on plenty of whipped cream on top.  The pancake itself was good, but honestly tasted like an afterthought.  It was super thin almost like a taco bowl and fell apart pretty easily when I cut into it.  Didn't hinder the taste at all, but the presentation was such that it was just sort of there.  Still, a tasty breakfast that left me full and satisfied.. . I'll be back at some point for a lunch or dinner go round.  And next time I probably won't be able to resist those pastries.  Overall, I can see why this place is so popular with the CenPho crowd.  You'll see suits, students, and joggers alike in this place.  I can't speak to the coffee, but obviously Yelpers are pretty high on that here.  I would imagine the Brophy/Xavier/Central High students probably frequent this place regularly.  And yes I'm a little bummed this place wasn't around when I was a student across the street.
Hipster. coffee.. Those two words pretty much sum up any decent review of this place. Everything else is just details. So...the details. This is a nice coffee shop in Phoenix. We drove around the block a few times before finding it since there aren't any signs anywhere. You basically walk into an unmarked door and...hipsters. everywhere. We went here on a Saturday morning while we were out exploring, and it was pretty crowded. This is a get to know your neighbor type of place. Unless your neighbor is set up at a table with an iMac, in which case don't get chatty. Still the coffee and the pastry were good and I could see this being a nice place to hang out as long as you don't mind people and noise.
You'll probably age a year before you get your food but I wouldn't know because after waiting fifteen minutes for food I gave up. The atmosphere made me angry and I let everyone know on my way out that they'll be waiting a fortnight in the line they're in.. . If you are not hip, don't enter this place. . . Be sure to have HOURS of time to kill. HOURS. . . Oh and stand along the glass, that's the line. But they don't let you know that and they are really rude about it. . . Screw this place.
This is one of my favorite places! They have the best coffee I have ever tried. It almost ruins it for you because you can never drink Starbucks again. Another item that I cannot resist when I go in is their freshly baked salted chocolate chip cookie made with a different nut each day. The staff is also friendly and will soon memorize your order if you go often enough!
This review is primarily for the coffee side of Lux:. . Lux has so much going for it. Location. Reputation. Vibes.... . I've been many times, and visited again today. My husband and I ordered iced coffee. It's always good, totally solid. Just the right amount of acidity, just the right amount of depth. The lines are long, yes...but this is some of the best coffee in town, so IT'S WORTH IT. Also, the staff is great about having the drinks ready shortly after you pay - they take your drink order while you're still waiting in line to reach the register. They've got their system down to a science. . . Also, once upon a time (in March 2014, maybe?) I had an espresso with lavender, agave, cinnamon...maybe some other things. It wasn't amazingly executed, but it was incredibly imaginative. I still give them props for taking this step.
My wife and I finally visited, and we loved it. Its laid back. The Mac and Cheese was delicious, along with the espresso cake. I loved the ice tea. I would certainly recommend this place. Grab a seat, drink a tea, and have a good day.
It such a cute and cozy cafe to hangout. I will definitly come back next time when I'm in town.
Awesome, made from scratch food and hand roasted coffee. The place is eclectic and crowded, but the Sunday morning DJ makes up for it. This place is cool.
The staff is friendly. The room temperature is always perfect -never too cold, the music is pleasant both in choice and volume. The coffee is very tasty. And the wait time is never long.
Even though I had to give this place a few tries, I really do love it! I just needed to get over the whirlwind of what happens after I walk in until the point at which I get my order. I can never tell if people are in line, looking at the HUGE display of tasty pastries, or waiting for their drink. There is often so much going on in the small ordering area but after a few visits, I see it more as a small space that builds connections/community. . . Normally, I order a regular black coffee or iced coffee. It's good here, but what really shines for them are their espresso drinks! The black and white, the caramel, the velvet...all sooooo good! They have alot of different choices too so make sure not to miss their menu board, which, unfortunately is kind of easy to miss. Don't be shy, just ask! It's easy to get scooted quickly in and out of the ordering mix, but just be confident. Everyone's super nice and willing to help! . . The atmosphere is really hip and trendy too, so make sure to order your drink to enjoy on the premise. Enjoy your drink with friends, or a really good book, or meet someone new!
Love everything about this spot!!! They have that village in the city like feel, that you just don't typically come across in Phoenix. They are opened LATEEEE, another thing you don't come across in Arizona!!  they have free wifi, plenty of seats ( inside and out) and a great menu from fresh squeezed juices to a long list of caffeine filled delicacies!!!! Only problem is finding this hidden gem !
Best Coffee in Arizona!  Love the staff, the baked goods and they make the best latte on the planet.  Now if they would open up 2nd one in Prescott, Id be in heaven!
Should you be sensitive to loud noises, fear crowded spaces, or cringe at a sea of be-speckled people sitting in front of macs, Lux may not be the place for you. However, if you enjoy a busy slice of downtown Phoenix, delicious espresso, tattoo watching, eating pastries outside, and freshly prepared breakfast, I would suggest you try this place out. The traffic flow of this place drives me insane, but then I have some coffee, maybe a cookie, and calm down to watch the word move by likely to a DJ-spun beat.
I love .... Lux's clientele. Lux's atmosphere. Lux's music. Lux's coffee & pastries. Lux. . Upon reading reviews on how hipster-this and hipster-that Lux was, it all finally made sense. I mean, I guess you kinda have to be there to understand ... /endhipstertonehere. I'm fine if you don't come here, Lux is swarming as is and I would like to have an opportunity to find seating.. . Mismatched, artsy interior. Music consisting of throw back R&B remixes and artists with sound styles similar to Lykke Li or The XX, it can get pretty loud. Pastries, coffee, teas and hot food.. . I ordered a Medium, Hot Vanilla Latte and a Lemon Poppy Seed Muffin with Icing. The latte came out with lovely latte art it was worth snapping a picture of- plus all the cool kids are doing it. The latte was probably one of the best lattes I've ever had, it was smooth, rich and warming. No bitterness from the coffee or strange tangy after taste and lovely kick of caffeine to get the heart pumpin'. The Lemon Poppy Seed Muffin was so good, lemon-y, tangy but slightly sweetened by the icing and it was so moist- dangerous I tell you!. . Since I came here to study, I found that this was a great study spot. Communal tables, outlets and people who aren't fussy if you sit across/next to them, clean bathrooms, great beverages filled with caffeine and delectable pastries. The workers here are also so pleasant, one of them even asked, "May I take this for you love?" How charming!. . And for all the hate on the hipsters, I think it's awesome especially if you're looking for a bit of fashion inspiration or enjoy people watching. I may have reached an epiphany however, if I love this hipster cafe; it's drinks/pastries, music, atmosphere and clientele ... does that make me a hipster!? Obviously not, hipsters don't ask themselves as such things.. . I will definitely be back Lux!
My favorite coffee place.  Love the furniture,  perfect for people watching, great music,  delicious food,  amazing coffee. You can do homework,  read, catch up with friends... The staff is nice,  most of the time.  Try the macaroni and cheese with jalapeno and bacon.
my favorite coffee shop and place to hang out on the weekends. The decor is amazing! open super late and the pastries are unique and delicious! definitely a hidden jem.
Love this place!!! Their ice vanilla latte is the best I've had, so delish. Only bad thing is that it is always super busy so it's not always easy to find a seat.
Holy mother of Jesus....This places eggs and hash and coffee is stellar.  It was crowded for sure on a Saturday which doesn't surprise me.  I wish they had a bigger patio unless they have another area I totally missed by chance.  I like to enjoy my food not so close and compact to other people I don't know it just doesn't comfort me in that sense.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves that type of thing being all close to a million people at once.  Anyways all I have to say to make this short and sweet is Tomato hash/eggs & White chocolate mocha with whip is definitely a new staple until i try the steak.
Best coffee in town. A+ for atmosphere and always friendly service. One of my favorite places in town.
If this place doesn't do something about their fly infestation, I won't be back.  It is getting ridiculous.  And if you have this many flies, they must be landing on the food you purchase before you even get it served.
