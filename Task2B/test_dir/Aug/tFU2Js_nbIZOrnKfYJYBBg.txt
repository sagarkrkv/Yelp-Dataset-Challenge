I wouldn't go to this restaurant when there are plenty of other options on the strip that has better service and higher quality food. We went here base on yelp reviews and I must say it was a disappointment. I order the beef hash and eggs with a side of bacon. My friend ordered the sirloin with eggs. Five minutes later they brought out the side of bacon before our drinks and the food. We had to send it back because it was ridiculous to just sat there and stare at the side of bacon. My friend streak was bland and tasteless, my beef-hash was mediocre nothing special. At the end we both agreed that only the French fries was decent.
When I was in Vegas a few months back for a bachelorette's part, I had wanted to try this place out; but it was out of some of the girls' budgets.. . We started out with some Kumamoto oysters on heal shell which were on the small side. They were sweet & slightly briny but not even close in the intensity of flavor to the oysters we get back home from Hog Island (read my reviews). We then got the Terrine de four gras de canard. It was rich, creamy, & just the right amount of saltiness to go with the toast. We had some leftover which I ate with a croissant later in our hotel room...sooo good.. . For main course I had the Scottish salmon which was cooked well & the lentils with ox tail was delightful & unexpected. The Boyfriend got the Rib eye steak special with a very nicely cooked steak. The creamed spinach was not too creamed which I liked. All in all, however, it wasn't quite worth its price of $65. Even though we stuffed ourselves full with the starters & the main courses, we still managed to sure some Bouchons which were not too sweet & went really well with the ice cream.. . The service was fantastic; friendly, attentive, & efficient. It was the truly the best I've ever experienced.
Besides the hostess of mean girls when you enter the restaurant, after trying to figure out the maze of Venetian to get to the restaurant, the server and the food made the experience a whole turn around for myself and my group. . . Now you're wondering mean girls of hostess? Yeah, four girls dressed in the same uniform would stare at each other and laugh to figure out who would have the unfortunateduty to walk us to the table. Smh. Or at least that how we felt. . . Luckily our server, I wish I remember her name but was the most helpful server ever. From grabbing us what we needed to giving us wonderful recommendations! The food was great. I had the eggs Benedict and it was so good but if you're not a big eater, def go share the plate. It's more than enough food! . . The place is a little on the pricey side but hey, you're in Vegas!
The ambiance presents a nice and relaxing environment to start your day. We arrived a little afternoon, so ordered two lunch apps with breakfast entrees. The soup de jour was tomato and it was fine. Basic, lots of cream and didn't really deliver that amazing tomatoey goodness we were looking for. With the soup, came our pommes frites which were the best food of the meal. Hot, crispy, creamy inside and seasoned perfectly. Our entrees consisted of the omelette with bacon, tomato and spinach and the French toast with cinnamon apples and caramelized bananas. The omelette was basic, nothing special and certainly not seasoned. Bland and boring, it was definitely a disappointment. The French toast was good. It comes out looking like a square of bread pudding, but has a nice flavor and consistency. We also ordered 2 overpriced champagne cocktails. Both were fine, but I was in no way blown away. Our server was very nice and professional, but overall, the food was not what I would expect from a Thomas Keller restaurant.
This is some killer french grub, I loved it.  Had a cucumber soup and the trout, amazing front to back side to side. Simple ingredients prepared perfectly.  Pricey but worth it.  The brunch is pretty stellar and classic french.  I would go again, after saving up my money.  Its not cheap. 5 star is rarely cheap!
Really disappointed.  Came here to celebrate special occasion but everything was really lame. The first person who seated us asked us how we were so I launched into a very basic french conversation. The guy looked at me like I was speaking. ..French! Then another person came to take our order. He really showed a lot of dis-interest. I'm even gonna call that guy out. Thanks Radaslow, for a poor show.  We ordered a warm chevre salad and salmon rilletes. So the salad was not warm. It was stone cold. We were brought bread but only one bread plate between two of us! Salmon rillettes were good but before I'd finished, another person brought out our entrees befire we were ready. We'd ordered steak-frites and the special lamb chop. Oh dear dear. The steak-frites was sooooooo ordinary,  and the lamb chop being freaking huge, and yet,  tasteless.  We struggled to finish so I asked Radaslow to box up our food but pack ice around it. I mean, it's the Las Vegas summer and my car will be 120F inside!  Again he looked at me like I was speaking. ...French.  I said, look,  wrap the food in plastic wrap, double it, then pack ice around it in a zip lock bag. He looked confused so went to consult someone.  This new guy came out and asked me to explain why I wanted ice. I said, because it's hot out! Then I said, Do you want me to show you how. I think he got a bit insulted by that , but I meant it sincerely. Maybe I'm an engineer and I'm too logical but you'd think they'd understand the importance of not letting boxed food spoil! Very expensive disappointment!
I was disappointed. I am a fan of Thomas Keller but found this Vegas outlet to come up short. Service was great, atmosphere was lively, and the place was designed well like a classic bistro. . . The food is where things came out short. Nothing was terrible mind you but hardly the standard you're expecting at such a name brand restaurant. The best was the salmon roulette which was interesting and unique. The French onion soup was tasty and the broth much thicker/more flavorful than I've had anywhere else.. . The oysters were pretty run of the mill. The frisee salad with egg was good but nothing special. The table bread was fantastic though.. . The real disappointment was the main entree - Steak Bouchon for $62. The meat was properly cooked but the quality (and quantity) of the meat just wasn't on par with any real steakhouse. Maybe it's unfair to compare but for $62 at any great steakhouse, you'd get a lot more food and much better taste. The frites were generous in portion though.. . I'd give the restaurant group a shot again but didn't leave impressed for my first experience in the Vegas location.
Came here for a meal at the end of the year. The pig ears were delicious and so were the clams. The trout was good but wasn't impressed considering how much I was paying for it. Next time, I'm gonna get the salmon roulade as everyone has been telling me to get. The service was spot on though.
First time having a Croque Madame so don't have anything to compare it too but it was delicious! The bread used is so dang tasty!. . Also, they forgot to bring us bread so we dipped the fries in the jelly they brought us and it was a very delicious combo- sweet and salty. Mmmm. . The Brioche was a little too rich and sweet for our taste but it didn't prevent us from cleaning our plates :)
Thomas Keller's more casual Las Vegas restaurant is one of my favorites when visiting the Sin City. Classic French cuisine that's been dialed back a notch, the meals are perfect as they aren't overly rich or filling. The Boudin Blanc is incredible. Also, check out Bouchon Bakery while in Vegas. Their French Macarons are to die for, especially the Salted Caramel variety.
I was unexpectedly disappointed with this restaurant. Being a Thomas Keller restaurant, I expected great things, but instead had one of the worst meals of my two week vacation. You could say it was just my meal, but my husbands was sub-par as well, the bread was tough, and the service was very slow and inattentive. . . I made a mistake of not going with a "classic" french meal, but the papperdelle with short rib ragu sounded interesting, so I decided to try it. I literally felt like I was eating one step up from dog food. I'm almost certain the kitchen had some leftover short rib dish that they reused, added WAY too much oil, and threw it on top of some broken up, leftover pasta. BLECH! . . It has always been a dream of mine to eat at the French Laundry, so I was excited to try one of Thomas Keller's restaurants. For a chef as renowned as he is, he should really pay more attention to the quality of his restaurants or else it is going to tarnish his reputation. . . I would NEVER recommend someone to try this restaurant in Las Vegas when there are SO many other options out there.
First time here. Wanted to try due to reputation of Thomas Keller. Food was great but service was only a 2 star
Unfortunately this was a disappointment. Bad reviews are as important as good ones and I felt I needed to share the disappointment in the food we experienced last night. When spending this kind of money you are entitled to certain expectations. These were not fulfilled. No close. Escape go were good and the onion soup was good but nothing stood out as a true experience. The food felt overdone. Trying too hard. Too rich - and yes this is French food which is rich - but this was too rich. Service was great.  Setting was great. But the food was a disappointment. . . We had 4 different main courses and a few appetizers and none of it impressed.
I was extremely disappointed with the breakfast here as well as with their pastries. I had ordered the burger since I figured a Thomas Keller restaurant should not mess that up; I was very wrong. The brioche bun did not seem fresh, burger patty was dry and flavorless, and the so called "animal sauce" was hardly in it. I highly doubt that they used Wagyu beef as the menu claims, even the meat at In-N-Out tastes better! I also didn't care for the chocolate almond croissant or the cheese danish, have had better elsewhere. My husband also didn't like his French toast, it lacked flavor and seemed too mushy.. . Even the service was lacking; the waitress never informed us of the specials and I only happened to glance at the chalk board in front of me after I placed my order. The food also took a long time to arrive. The coffee we were served was cold. All in all,  I would not recommend this place since it's all hype and no substance.
Join family trip to Vegas, and brother-in-law suggests we eat at Bouchon for brunch.  Heard this famous restaurant owned by one of the best chef, thus expected it could cost some fortune for such high-end dining.  We order some pastry and I order salad and the Kobe beef burger . At my first sight, it looks simple and decent. After I start eating, I find really impressed by such a simple order:. Salad - it is compact solid volume, not like the rest ever--loose, tossed; and EVERY LEAVES are tender, juicy and flavoury.  I never expect a salad can be provided with such quality. Never before.. Burger - It looks funny to me : burger with fried union ring.  When I try my first bite, the crunch fried ring induces one of the best combination when chewing and tasting this juicy burger.  It is fried to the perfect degree for you to chew on it, meanwhile, not oily at all and harmony with beef patty and tomato.  SO TASTY, and makes my mouth watering by just thinking about its flavor!. Pastry - no doubt about it: fresh and taste GREAT (not too sweet as most American pastry). ( I feel it's better than those in Bouchon retail bakery). Most impressed, overall price is frugal (cheaper than eating at casino buffet for ourgroup) with such a high-end dining environment.  . For sure I will come back at my next Vegas visit.
*Restaurant Week 2014 Review*. . Bouchon put together a really dinner nice menu for restaurant week.  The table started with a large bowl of pitted olives and 1 tasty salmon rillette each.  I would go back just to eat the rilletes, they were salty silky perfection.  The next course was a tomato salad which was dressed with a flavorful basil dressing. I really loved this salad because I am crazy about tomatoes.  For the main, we chose the trout which was beautifully presented and came with tons of toasted almonds and green beans.  The portion was very satisfying and it was cooked nicely but I had trout earlier that day from DB Brasserie and DB's was quite a bit better.. . The low point was dessert which was an unimaginative chocolate mousse.  The mousse was boring yet rich and was paired with a bland custard creme. Just remembering the dessert makes me want to bump this review down a star but the service and ambiance of the restaurant were excellent.
Let me first say that I love Thomas Keller. I like that he rose up the ranks the old fashion way and essentially a self taught master chef of the 3 Michelin Star  - The French Laundry (Of which I hope to go one day). I understand that Bouchon is not trying to be The French Laundry. I wanted to love Bouchon but unfortunately it was a let down. . The highs were the bread and butter. The large seafood platter. The service. . The lows and it was really low was my main course of a 9 oz. Rib steak that cost $62. A complete letdown and I know Thomas Keller if he was there would never serve it. It was dry and favourless. I did not send it back since it was not a mistake; my other dinner companion order the same thing and the results were the same. . . Avoid the steak since $62 bucks can buy you a much better steak in Vegas. Get if off the menu please. Everything else was great including dessert.
Really good food. It's not as expensive as it was feared to be. Food had good clean flavors. Some food was basic but just Perfectly cooked which added to the flavors.
