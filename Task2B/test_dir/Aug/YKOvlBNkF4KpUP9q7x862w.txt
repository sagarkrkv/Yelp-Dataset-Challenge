This is a must dine experience while in Scottsdale.  The table side Guacamole is the best my family has ever eaten.  My kids devoured the crispy pork & cola lime glaze.  The pork shoulder that my son and I shared was heavenly.  My daughter found the Mahi Mahi Tacos fantastic.  The best fish tacos that she has ever eaten.  The Pumpkin bread pudding and fried bananas for desert were exceptional.  . . I have been to the mission several times for business, and I have never been disappointed.
I was drawn to this Yelp page by a highlighted review that said "medium priced" so I went to their yuppie-shmuppie, faux-mexican, overpriced menu.  I remembered the slogan of the now defunct Karem's from my childhood in San Antonio:  "Mexican food don't cost nuthin".. . Read these reviews and if faus gras empanadas and watermelon basil mojitos appeal to you, go for it.  I am going to La Canasta or Los Dos Molinos.
As always, it was out of this world delicious.  The customer service was outstanding too!
My friends and I came here for my birthday and loved it. It is a little pricey, but you get quality food that tastes delicious. I highly recommend the tableside guacamole and corn (on the cob). If you're a foie gras fan like me, the duck carnitas empanadas are not to be missed. We finished it all off with the pork shoulder tacos and mahi mahi tacos. It was all great for sharing and I would definitely go back to explore more of the menu.
The atmosphere is very "Scottsdale" and upper-class. I would suggest wearing formal-casual attire at the minimum, but that is just my opinion. The food was pretty good, the the price was not commensurate with the quality. You are paying a high price for the atmosphere, and that it about it.
Let's see, it's loud. Stupid loud. My server miss heard or fucked up my order horrendously. The server said she had worked there for six years. Acted like a rookie. I had to flag some body down because they left us with no chips once the guacamole was made. Then again to get the ice tea my friend ordered. I felt neglected. Then he took our guacamole before we finished eating it. She told me that she would serve the mahi ahi tacos to a five year old. I agree. Why beer batter a great fish like that? It tasted frozen or pre-packaged. From a restaurant that isn't a chain I was sorely disappointed. Let us be honest. The portions are great for skinny Scottsdale courtesans, however like most terrible Mexican places, I filled up on the chips. . . Maybe I just had a bad night. When I return I expect better service. I want to be impressed by the food. Till then, only two stars.. . The pros: pretty decor, nice salt wall, and bar is well stocked.
Oh my goodness this place blew me away! I'm from El Paso, Tx where we seem to have tacos down ... Or so I thought! I ordered the guacamole as an appetizer... A few minutes later they have a chef walk out with the food cart to ask you your preference in spice.. Mild to spicy (which is a nice touch)  They prepare in front of your table. It was DELICIOUS! It has it's owns taste ... Then to my surprise the experience only got better! The chicken tacos were THE BEST tacos I've had! VERY FLAVORFUL .. I was very impressed with the ambience and authenticity of the restaurant as well.  As a Hispanic I not only know good Mexican food but I know great service and it was at the mission. THANK YOU!
Amazing! Short rib tacos were some of the best I've had. Lunch wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. Service was excellent.
The food was great ! Maybe not the chicken tacos but everything else wasdelicious! From the moment we walked in it was a great experience. Our server was absolutely fantastic such a kind man with excellent tips about the food! Thanks for the great experience, Angel! (I think that is his name) a complimentary bread pudding with vanilla ice cream, pomergrante a & pumpkin seeds! Yum!
Really fun restaurant with great flavors.. . We started with the kale salad (yummy), followed by the flat iron steak and sides of torreados (blistered peppers) which were to die for, and chipotle grits.  . . Service was wonderful -- when we couldn't decide between two desserts (the fried bananas with peanut butter and the pumpkin bread pudding), our server brought us both!. . Cocktails are also great -- especially those with tequila.  :)  The cucumber jalepeno margarita was excellent.. . Ambience is a little dark/clubby for the desert but comfortable.. . Definitely worth it for a night out!. . Tami
Oh wow.  This was a culinary experience that I will never forget.  I am so glad I found this restaurant.. . "The Mission" is next door to The Mission -- that is, the original Spanish Mission from 1905 or so in Scottsdale.  They are not related as far as ownership, but share a similar style.. . The restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  Dim chandeliers, and lights hidden behind warm quartz rock and crystals, and gothic decorations, lots of mirrors, crosses, and an angel in the middle of the restaurant.. . The servers here are all very friendly and positive.  We had a reservation for the wrong date, but they were able to accommodate us even though we had it wrong. . . The bar is lively, as is the rest of the restaurant.  Lots of couples on dates, men discussing business, and groups of girls doing a "girls night out", all dressed up. . . The food was fantastic.  The small tacos were perfect portion sizes, and the kale salad was spicy and unique and delicious.  The drinks were all great.  Cannot recommend this restaurant enough.  Really a fun time and a great date spot.
My first visit here was a great!  The second was so-so.  This time we had to eat on the back patio. There were like a lot of flies were buzzing around the food.  Also seemed a little dated.
Went for thhe first time yesterday.  The wait staff is exceptional and knowledgeable.  Our table was comfy and well situated.  The margaritas were quite nice and well made.  The guac was good but not spicy enough, BUT the women asked for it medium.  The duck empanada was enough for 3 people.  One person had street tacos and they were quite tasty. One person had the filet BUT was quite small ( +-3-4 oz for $35).   I had short ribs which were tasty but a again very small portion.   The coffee and chocolate desert was exceptional.    The negatives are the price point is quite high.  I am not complaining but a bit more food on the entrees is warrented.  Ill go again but it wont be weekly thing,  $270 for 3 people is not a weekly venture.
I love this restaurant! I have never ordered anything that wasn't yummy. Some of my favorites: Almejas Al Vapor, Pork Shoulder Tacos, Crispy Pork Belly. The restaurant  is very cozy, especially the front patio by the fire in the winter. The service is friendly and professional. Eat here!
The best Mexican food I have ever had!  I had chicken tacos, husband had steak tacos. Pumpkin bread pudding was off the hook!  Service 5 stars!  Definitely will be coming back!!
To put it concisely, the food was tiny & weird, though they do get props for excellent decor.. . The place looks nice, there's no denying it. There's an obvious theme going on, low-light interior with candles on every surface, around a dozen and a half ornate chandeliers, crosses on the back wall to tie in with the actual Spanish Mission. It's going for dark & solemn, and it hits the mark, so kudos for that.. . The food, though...I mean, I suppose my group and I should have been prepared for pretentious presentation and ridiculously small portions, given that this is Scottsdale, but seriously, when the food came out, we looked at each other, had a bit of a moment, all clearly baffled by how little we each had on our plates. It tasted alright, and was artfully plated, but still, far too small.. . And it wasn't only the portions; part of the problem, at least for me personally, was what they tried to pass off as a salad. It was maybe five slivers of onion, a few itty bitty greens, and half a dozen extremely thin-sliced tomatillas. This was all sprinkled over my flat iron steak and repeatedly referred to by the waitress as a salad. It was not a salad. It was a garnish that they tried to talk up as a very fancy salad so they could justify charging $30 for the meal.. . My group and I will not be returning. We're happy to visit our usual Mexican restaurant haunts. But hey, in an attempt to end on a happy note, I'd like to mention that the service was awesome. The hostesses were welcoming, our waters were refilled probably 7 or 8 times, our waitress was very friendly and attentive, and a manager checked on us halfway through the meal.. . Maybe we should have told the manager that the food was tiny and weird...oh well.
It takes a lot for me to be blown away and to be convinced of true authenticity, but this award winning chef and restaurant nailed it!. . Dim lighting, gothic, mid evil style chandeliers line the ceiling as you enter the dining room, and you have an immediate sense of the caliber of cuisine. We sat in the outdoor patio which was glowing with twinkling lights and white table cloths draped the tables. I also appreciated that there was plenty of air to keep you cool on a hot August desert night. . . The true flavoring and fresh ingredients were so mouth watering and unique that it continued to impress at every bite. The smells, the textures, the surprise at every dish was truly an experience. Our table enjoyed a variety of entrees from the fresh mahi tacos, corn on the Cobb, kale salad, and of course grazed on some fresh, handmade table side guacamole! . . Phenomenal existence of this restaurant, and I can truly say one of my favorite cuisine experiences!
