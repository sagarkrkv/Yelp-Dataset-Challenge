Just complete a stay at Bally's Las Vegas and I was fairly disappointed. . . The good: Upgraded rooms are nice but I don't think they purchased new mattresses as mine was lumpy and sagged in the middle. . . The bad:  Room service only operates from 6am-1pm.  That's right, no late night breakfast after being out gambling until 2am.. . The really bad: The upgraded rooms on the south side of the tower are subjected to the noise from the Chateau night club at the Paris. Generally hotels will let you know this at check-in but they failed to and on my second night there, VERY loud until after 3am. . . In the end, the Front Desk Manager, Ronin, took care of a few of our room charges for the trouble. . . All in all, Bally's has quit a bit of work to do to catch up to it's neighbors on the strip. I personally will not be staying there again.
I booked a room here for a friends birthday in January for a planned trip in July.  So, booking early I got a GREAT deal for the room.  Needless to say this was the ONLY positive I got out of this trip.  I get there early about 10am before the stated check in time, and notice there was a line for early check in.  I come to Vegas at least once a year, so I know there is an extra charge for early check in at some if not most hotels.  So, no problem.  I'm in my 30's, so I'm no obnoxious 21 year old who stumbles in looking to check in early.  I approach the counter and the lady instantly tells me "There is an early check in fee."  No "Welcome To Bally's" No "Good Morning" nothing. I had an excellent flight that morning and was with a friend, so I shrugged it off no big deal, but in my mind it definitely rubbed me the wrong way.  I end up using my Debit card for incidentals and the lady made it a point "Are you sure you have enough funds, because you're not going to be refunded for 7-10 days?"  I wanted to say to her, "Are you kidding me?" But, I didn't.  I was not rude at one moment with her, but really didn't understand why she made it like I was cheap or something.  So, customer service at the start of my stay EXTREMELY POOR.. . I get to my room and instantly check out the view.  Nice view of the new ferris wheel and Drais, so I liked it until I looked at the seal and the windows.  The paint was chipping and the seal was rusted.  Again, no big deal to me, but I know some clean freaks that would've been urked at the sight.  . . Began to get ready and jumped in the shower.  Bathroom was comfortable, amenities were fully stocked, but halfway through my shower, the drain wouldn't drain so I'm knee deep in soap water.  Call the front desk and they tell me they're going to send someone up.  Maintenance guy comes and explains to me he can snake the drain and its going to take 15 minutes he needs to get his equipment.  While I'm waiting, 5 minutes later front desk calls my room and rudely says to me "You need to open your door, the maintenance guy is waiting" I opened the door and see a completely different maintenance guy asking "What's the problem?"  Utterly confused I call the front desk and ask for a new room.  As I get off the phone, now there's two more maintenance guys trying to drain 1 tub.  This entire time, from the front desk to now this situation I attempted to remain calm, but now it just got ridiculous.  So, my grade for the room...EXTREMELY POOR (and by the way they did NOT give me another room after my request for one).. . My trip was Sat-Mon and all of this happened on a Saturday morning.  I wanted to stay away as much as I could from the hotel which I did, some of the good things about this hotel were the buffet was decent, the elevators were fast and the beds did provide a good sleep.  Taxis and shuttles just like any other hotel were a little tough to get a hold of, but another tip spend an extra couple bucks and get one of those SUV/shuttles that aren't taxis but charge a flat rate rather than a timed rate.  . . My last comment on why I'm rating this a terrible experience, when I checked out Monday morning I am pleasantly greeted by the lady at the front desk (ironic right?) asks for the card I paid for incidentals.  She swipes my card and says "You should see your refund in the next day or two" I couldn't believe it, but by the time I got back home Monday afternoon, I see the refund waiting in my account.  So, what was the first lady talking about I had to wait 7-10 days, then this lady tells me 24-48 hours?  Very poor overall experience.  I will NEVER stay at Bally's Las Vegas ever again.
This is my second time staying at this hotel.. First time was 2 years ago and it sucked. I have to say the hotel upgraded a lot and cleaned up well.. . Room- room was compt from my friends Player's comps. We got the jubilee tower suite which was a big room I would say about 950 square feet. More then enough space to hold a party or a room of drinks.. My only issue with the room was the AC. The room was to big for the AC to keep the room cool. Bathroom was kind of small for a suite. But decor was nice, and close to elevators, and a view of the north strip. The elevators were a nightmare. Only 3 elevators for the top 12 floors. One of the elevators was out of order so leaving 2 elevators in service. Sometimes we waiting as long as ten mins to get to the room, and cramed in the elevator. . . Casino-is nice and cleaned up well from the last time I stayed. Hotel doesn't smell old. Casino is not as big as the other hotels but it's also not crowded which makes it pleasant to gamble. . . Downstairs 24hr daily deli was awesome. . . Hotel-staff is extra nice and attentive and polite. They don't have sticks up their asses like some of the higher end hotels. Maid turn down service was fast and I honestly didn't notice she was in the room cleaning. She even brought us more water and ice and towels. Extra tip to her . . Over all this hotel was good. Only the elevators being slow and crappy is why this did not get 5 star.
This review is for the LA comedy club.  Got VIP tix, meant all you can drink...cheap beer or wine for 29 minutes before they opened the doors to the general public...uh, can we upgrade to the wine that you open with a cork screw or better beer that doesn't start with bud or coors...good thing I like coors...but prefer imports or blue moon...too bad we only pounded two rounds...oh, how we have matured since college.  Good comedians and great security, can I get back to my seat, my wrist band doesn't mean anything...overall good experience and good comedians
Ballys is my personal favorite place to stay when in Las Vegas. Its location is very convenient to everything. The check in line is sometimes very long, there is about a 30 minute wait. I suggest arriving early and pay the early check in fee if you dont like waiting. . . The staff is great. Sometimes too great... housekeeping comes by a few times a day to see if you need anything. That can be a bit annoying if you have the do not disturb sign up. =/ . . The rooms are nice and very, very clean. I always get an awesome view of either the strip or the paris. If you want total quiet I dont suggest these views. You can hear music playing all night. The Indigo Towers arent newly remodeled like the Jubilee Tower is, therefore, the Indigo Towers cost less, but the rooms are still clean. . . There is always covered parking available, and its free. They dont have cable really... but you can purchase new movies for $11.99. =] . . The Ballys Casino is my ultimate fave casino in LV. I recommend this hotel and casino.
Money Money... Money.. Nice place to play and stay
Bally's is one of my favorite hotels to stay at. I decided to stay here for my birthday weekend since it in the middle of the strip (walking distance to Planet Hollywood, Caesar's, Drai's). There's also a free shuttle to Rio.  When I checked in, Nilo was very friendly and patient. I was upgraded from a classic suite to a Jubilee Celebritysuite for a discounted rate. The upgrade suite was beautiful and spacious! . . Besides from the hotel, I felt the slot machines were pretty limited. The restaurants here are also limited. The food court is hidden at the back of the hotel. But because Bally's is conveniently located in the middle, it's very close to walk to nearby hotels with more restaurant choices. . . Overall, Bally's is an affordable and convenient hotel to stay at.
I have been a loyal guest of this hotel for the last 12 years. Unfortunately I will no longer frequent this property.  The rooms and public areas were very dirty. They changed the Indigo lounge & no longer have the band that provided much needed energy to spark the atmosphere. They took away the affordable buffet and replaced it with a Brunch that is $90 per person and the other main restaurant closes at 2pm. Although they seem to be making upgrades, they seem to be going for the over 70 crowd.  Time to say Bye-Bye Ballys and hello MGM.
Bally's will do in a pinch but you can do much better in Las Vegas. Our recent two-night stay at Bally's included a bout with food poisoning from the their in-casino "deli". Apparently - a chicken-salad sandwich on a hot day/night was not a good idea. We think it was the chicken or mayo or both. . . Our room was nothing special. The carpet was old and wifey said the whole place smelled like "old cigarette smoke". . . The Valet guy was rude when I went into the wrong lane. They have construction going on and I was confused. . . The wait at check-in was lengthy. : ((. . What did we like? The view across the way of The Cromwell, and High Roller.
The review is for the craps table. We went to this hotel for the pool, we booked a cabana via groupon; while leaving the fun pool we stopped at a caps table and one of the side dealers were switched out. I said "yay they must have brought In the guy who's the got luck." This douchebags name was Pedro. So his response to me while I'm standing behind my husband was....are you ready for this....."take your top off!" Seriously!  my fast response was a very stern NO! It took a minute to register to my husband what this dude said. So loosing $200 we left and Pedro got a nice talking to by my husband and I'm sure his pit boss. I hope that jerk learned his lesson that you don't speak to women like that and lost his job.
Coming off of Rand's suggestion and well, free rooms we get from my father in law for spending (blowing?) a lot of money in this place, we stayed at Bally's. The casino area is crowded but they usually have someone on stage performing and you get to really experience the excitement of the casino atmosphere. Check in can be a nightmare, so slow at times but if you are VIP, they have a checkout/in for that. . . The rooms are pretty quiet, we stayed in the North Tower for three days if that helps. Prices for rooms seemed reasonable. Although the rooms were free, I can confirm that the LV sandwich trick does work here. Shhh, don't tell them I sent you! Eat a Gordon Ramsey Burger in Paris downstairs!
Not Bad, Not Great. It is a pretty standard Hotel. . The Steakhouse, though is great.. I would also recommend skipping the Jubilee Show.
I reserved a king size bedroom, at arrival, the lady at the check in pretty much told me I can't get a King size bedroom..she didn't really give me an explanation why....I ended up getting a queen size bedroom with a terrible view; probably the worst view at the Bally's hotel..room is pretty decent for the price..getting a hold of room service is terrible..I might not stay at Bally's again..my overall satisfaction experience at Bally's is OK I guess..also what I noticed is the customer service was very fake and forceful..
Horrible customer service.  In new towers 2 of 3 elevators didn't work.  Old towers run down.  NEEDS WORK
Great location...easy to get to Bellagio, Caesars, Venetian. Updated rooms.  Connected to Paris.  Price is right.
Not bad at all. Liked that we had Paris next door and we were able to go from one hotel to another. Just about smack in the middle of thestrip. . We'd stay there again.
I have stayed at Bally's 3 times over the last 5 years . This trip was the best yet!. I cannot say enough about the staff. They treated us great from the moment we registered. They went out of their way to make sure we had a room that we wanted and when we wanted.. The cleaning ladies did a good job and were very helpful also. As well as the pool staff and cocktail waitress. . The only bad part of Bally's was the in hotel breakfast buffet. The buffet was terrible, and so was the food I ordered off the actual menu. I will not go back there again!!! Even my husband who eats everything could stomach the buffet.. Good hotel and staff
Stayed in a comped Jubilee Celebrity Suite with connecting Jubilee Suite (Rooms 6809 & 6811) about a month ago from 7/31-8/4 for my 27th birthday. The newly renovated Jubilee Tower is totally awesome and is much appreciated, especially with a veteran property on The Strip such as Bally's.. . I was only expecting a Jubilee Suite with maybe a regular connecting room with two Queen beds, but opening the door to the living room of the Celebrity Suite was a huge surprise for us. With the two combined suites, we had two bedrooms with a King in each, 2.5 bathrooms, two whirlpool tubs, a bar with sink & fridge, an additional fridge in each bedroom for a total of three, a nice 55" television in the living room (no HD unfortunately), a 36" or 42" in each bedroom, a free safe in each bedroom that they don't charge for anymore, and a dining table for six people. We had a fifth friend join us for Friday night and there was more than enough room for the roll-away bed I had brought up for him. Another friend complained that the amount of space was way too much for only five (mostly four) guys for the weekend, making it feel like we were split into two groups isolated in each of the bedrooms at times.. . I've been in other comped suites at Bally's, Paris, and Caesars over the years, but this was the best room I've ever had in Vegas so far. I can't emphasize the room being comped enough, for these two suites were valued at around $3700-3800 total for the four nights we stayed (Thursday-Monday).. . The reasons why I decided to not give these guys 5 stars is because of the extremely long waiting time to catch an elevator. They have one elevator bay with 6 separate elevator cars in total for the entire tower while the Indigo Tower (formerly North Tower) has two separate bays of 6 for a total of 12 elevators to access its 26 floors. In the Jubilee Tower, three go to the lower half of the tower while the other three go to the upper half, so the wait could get quite ugly with only three elevators accessing 12-15 floors. The lights in our half-bathroom in the living room also went out on the second night there and I never called maintenance to come fix them, but I guess I can only blame myself for that one. . . Our southward view of Paris and the Fountains of Bellagio all the way down to Mandalay Bay was pretty cool, too.. . Waiting for a taxi was a breeze since my Total Rewards "Diamond" card allowed us to bypass the que and hop into one of the next three cabs.. . The walk from the parking garage behind Paris to check-in then to the Jubilee Tower kinda sucks, but it isn't nearly as bad as the walk from the parking garage to check-in at Caesars Palace.. . We went to Rehab at Hard Rock, so we never used the pool on the property. It does have a deep end reaching a depth of 12-13', something that is completely lacking at most Las Vegas properties, if not all. I used to love their pool as a child.. . One of my friends kept asking what some weird hissing noise was during our stay. I finally realized on Sunday that it was a steam vent/pipe coming from the north wall of Paris next door. The noise wasn't constant, but the hiss would occur all day and night for maybe up to 30 seconds at intermittent times. I got used to it after the second day.. . Lastly, the sandwiches and hot dogs at the Nosh in the casino at the bottom of the Jubilee Tower were 100x better than what they now serve at the Sidewalk Cafe. This is very sad, for I used to always stay at Bally's through my childhood years and really enjoyed their meals when they used to be much better.. . I highly recommend the newly renovated Jubilee Tower rooms and suites, and would gladly stay in them again for my birthday next year. I would never stay at Bally's again if it wasn't a new Jubilee Tower room. Customer service at Caesars Entertainment properties has always been excellent for as long as I can remember, as well. I had to be sure to mention that.. . If you're a Vegas visitor who actually pays for their rooms, the nightly rates at Bally's will never break the bank and they possess some prime real estate at a prime location at the corner of Flamingo & The Strip. Sure, the property has been around for decades and has been showing its age for years, but you sure as Hell could do a lot worse than Bally's.
A bang for your buck. Just got back from my first vegas trip. When we checked in by a nice staff member we got upgraded to the jubilee tower. Our room was very nice, huge shower, great corner view of the strip. Room was perfect! The first night which was Friday the beach club across the way was pretty loud but after that night it wasn't.  My husband & his best friend LOVED the tacos at the tequila bar during happy hour. $2 tacos, beer, magaritas & tequila shots. We went there every night before bed. Also loved how Ballys was connected to Paris. Gorgeous hotel. I would go back & stay at ballys again without a doubt. The location is perfect.
