What's up with the reviews? People be complaining bout the customer service like come on bro its a buffet its self service, get your ass up and do it yourself. The food is great here. Big selection of food, from asian to mexican to mediterranean. Won't be coming back here though because its LV and there's so much more to try out there in the strip.
I used to love this buffet. It had great hot crab legs and everything else was at least good if not great every time I had gone before. Well, no more. They took away the hot crab. I am so disappointed. The rest of the food is hit or miss. The last trip we went some of the food had been sitting out too long and was cold/crunchy. The pork (carnitas) taos was the best thing I ate that night. Hard to make up $45 for a buffet with tiny carnitas tacos... And the service wasn't great either. We got ignored half the time by our waitress. All I wanted wsa some napkins and a tea refill.When we first got there I was lookiing for the hot crab legs they used to have and couldn't find them so I asked a cook behind the serving station "Do you still have hot crab legs?" He said "We are unable to answer your questions. If you need an answer talk to your waiter". Ok... A simple no would have sufficed. When I got to dessert I was thinking of all the yummy things I had got there before (creme brulee, tarts, little cakes...) no, only a few sad little cupcakes and none of them tasted good. I had actually tasted some last visit and liked them so I don't know what happened. But the whole quality of this buffet has gone way downhill. So sad :-(
This buffet was disgusting. I have never wasted so much food in my life. Everything was very bland. Flavorless. Even the desserts were a huge let down. A bunch of nasty cupcakes and flan that tasted like nothing at all. Don't waste your money here.
It certainly wasnt bad, I normally like the world buffet at the rio, but we decided to try this.  About the same price and what I feel like was a slightly better selection.  Lots and lots of options including a seafood station even at lunch.  Everything I tried was pretty awesome.  I had one complaint that the wait atafg was very slow with refilling our drinks and clearing plates but they all were very pleasant.  The same cannot be said for the people who you pay and ring you up and our hostess almost seemed bothered that she had to seat us.  They (much like every other buffet here) put the worlds most unpleasant people there.
Each time my family frequents the Las Vegas Strip on holiday, we set aside one night for a dinner buffet & this time, we finally visited the Spice Market Buffet! . I really liked this one because of its wide layout & full selection - To me, it seemed longer/ larger in size than most other Vegas buffets... Meaning that the various kitchens were seen stretched out across a huge plain in a way that actually took some time to get through . Luckily, we spent some time walking around the shops in the Miracle Mile before coming here, to make sure were hungry & super ready once we got started :p. As far as the food options here, I found that there were plenty of non-meat dishes alongside the meat ones, so it was, i.m.o., an acceptable buffet for someone with a Vegetarian diet (and perhaps somewhat accommodating for a Vegan). The title categories in this buffet include, Seafood, Salad (on both ends of the room), Italian, Asian, American, Mid-Eastern, & Mexican. The Seafood seemed traditional (Paella, crab legs, stuffed fish, sushi, etc.) but very decent in presentation, Salads were mostly prepared mixes, next to some free toppings & leaves, & the rest housed all the usual/ popular items you'd expect: pizza, pasta, lasagna, dried meats & cheeses, lo mein, fried rice, Thai eggplant, egg rolls, dumplings, fried chicken + biscuits, steamed vegetables, prime rib, (mashed and au gratin) potatoes, tabbouleh, hummus, stuffed grape leaves, curry, naan, curried cauliflower, lamb, & veggie kabobs, rice, beans, tacos, tamales, quesadillas, salsa, guac, & other toppings, with tons of bread! I found almost all the food I tried to be pretty good but I specifically went back for the eggplant, curry sauce, & veggie kabobs more than once :). I was, however, sad to find that the soup (both Miso & Tortilla varieties) were way too salty for my taste, even though I love salt & I love soup! lol I was also disappointed with the Dessert table, as it strongly lacked creativity or any sense of variety compared to all the other buffets I've been to. Besides the watery bread pudding & some nasty-looking, canned fruit crumble thing, there were not many other plates laid out. I saw creme brulee, mini cheesecakes, small parfaits, & ice cream but other than those... there was nothing more than 10 different kinds of cupcakes. For the cupcakes, they had some very simple flavours like Mint Choc Chip, Chocolate Raspberry, Cannoli, Bananas Foster, Strawberry Shortcake, Keylime Pie, S'mores, & Cookies + Cream... which may sound good to some people but I would have liked to see something other than cupcakes... Since it is a buffet & people will most likely be returning to the dessert bar more than once, I think they would do better with a bigger selection (i.e. fruit, custards, cakes, brownies, & other crap that people only allow themselves to eat on vacation :p). However, they do offer a "Chef's Special Selection" that I'm guessing they change frequently, which happened to be some pre-cooked (then reheated) crepes w/ nutella & sugared-bananas that night. . We came around 10 p.m. (1 hr before closing) on Sunday night & were treated very well in the V.I.P. section - Plates cleared often, drinks constantly refilled, social/ talkative waitress, & ALL food items present & filled as if it was still an early dinner hour... So we really enjoyed ourselves at this buffet & would easily return even with our plans to make our way through all the others on the strip :D
We only went in because of the groupon deal for two dinners and a bottle of champaigne. I had never been to this buffet, and I was pleased to see no line. Most of the workers were rude and straight faced. A lady came up to us and asked of we needed anything, and walked away before we had time to answer. The food was bland, and had been sitting there a while (crab legs smelled extra fishy, turkey breast was extra dry and hard). On a positive note, the roasted carrots with raisins and almonds, and the flan were excellent and they had a good selection of cupcakes and dinner rolls. The cleanliness of the place was acceptable, and they had a restroom conveniently located so I could wash my hands from the crab leg juice. There is absolutely no cellphone signal (buffet located at ground level) and the hotel charges you $13.99 to use their wifi per 24hr period. Very unlilely for me to return.
The food was okay. Tasted like microwavable dinners.   You get what you pay for.  I'd rather pay more to eat at a good buffet.  We paid $40 for 2 dinners.
For a pretty cool hotel & casino, this is a pretty terrible buffet. I came here eons ago for dinner, and thought it was awful... Years later, I come in for some breakfast and it was... Still terrible. Different course menu, same end result. It's no wonder it's never busy.. . The food is obviously drying up under the heat lamps, and none of it is fresh. You know that one dish you keep going back to? Well this buffet didn't evenhave that for me. The variety SHOULD be ample, but it really wasn't. The pancakes and waffles tasted like cardboard. Just wouldn't come back here again. Had better buffets for $4.99 at The Red Rock.
The staff were all very polite. The place was clean. I bought the all you can drink wine and was please that the waitress did keep my glass full. The good stops there. The food was awful. There was a large variety of food, but the only thing that tasted good was the prime rib. Some of the food was cold, the rest just didn't taste good at all. We sampled a little from each station, and we didn't eat a full plate of food between the two of us. This is no place for a foodie. The dessert station greets you as you wait to be seated, and it looks delicious. I got two cupcakes and could not eat either of them. One bite and I was done. They were awful. If I didn't use a coupon, I would have been very, very, very upset. We had half off coupons from one of the street vendors. So I didn't fell too bad about paying for such a disappointing dinner.
