Party of 4 on a Monday evening.  Busy but not too crazy.  Like the open kitchen layout.. . I went in knowing exactly what I wanted --- the famous beef wellington.  It takes 45 minutes to prepare.  I asked if I could order that as soon as we got seated, but the server told us that the chefs request everything ordered together.  . . The server brings by raw samples of all the cuts, which is quite impressive.. . Started off with some bread, which was delicious.  Warm, crispy, a couple of different varieties --- personal fav was the one with pancetta baked in.. . Started off with the pork belly appetizer, which was phenomenal.   For our group, we each probably got 1.5 bites, so it's not a huge portion, but sufficient for a taste.. . Then we got our steaks.  No complaints from anyone.  The wellington was amazing ---  filet mignon medium rare inside that incredible pastry crust.  I watched a bunch of Youtube clips on how Ramsay makes it, and I almost expected to be disappointed given my insanely high expectations.  Nope.  Surpassed it.  Every bite was moist and flavorful (and again, it's filet mignon, which often has no taste if not done right).. . We were way too full for dessert.  Fantastic meal, great location, friendly servers.  Probably a lifetime top 3 steak for me.
We decided to try GR Steak for our one high end dinner out on our last trip to Vegas.  We always try to fit a really nice meal in each time we come.  The food, in general, was very good, and the cocktails were fantastic (especially the blueberry aperitif).  The downside of the drinks are that they took forever to come, the waiter took our drink orders within about 10 minutes of us sitting down - not speedy, but not ridiculous either - however they took about 30 minutes to come to the table.  That's 40 minutes before even putting in a dinner order.  I don't think that's a reasonable time frame.. . My parents-in-law had the Wellington for two, my sister-in-law had the Wellington for one, and my wife and I shared the Royal Long Bone Chop.  The Wellingtons were amazing, as expected given their status of 'signature dish'.  The salads and sides were also great, exactly what one would expect from a restaurant of this calibre (especially the mac and cheese, by far the best I've ever tried).  The steak, however, was pretty underwhelming.  I've eaten at a number of higher end steakhouses and been really blown away by a few.  This was good; the seasoning was good, the cook on the steak was good, the presentation was good.  None of it was great though, and the meat was somewhat chewy.  It would have been fine for a $50 32oz steak, but not for $100.  We got through about half of it, mostly because we were really hungry after waiting another hour for the entrees to arrive, but eventually decided to say something.  . . The manager was very confrontational, telling us that we had no place to complain because she checked on the table earlier and everything was fine.  That's true, but she checked about 30 seconds after the food came out, so our answer was based entirely on the mac and cheese at the time.  My wife started to mention that our expectations for the service and the  steak at a place like this are higher, and that they were very well reviewed in general on sites like Yelp (and many of it's counterparts), to which the manager asked my wife if she was threatening her.  Yes, 'threatening her".  I considered walking out at that point, and I'm sure Gordon Ramsay would have thrown a frying pan her way if he'd  heard something like that from his manager.  . . We then asked to speak with the general manager and he came to the table (15 minutes later) and offered us free dessert.  It was a nice gesture, but we were a little tired of waiting around at that point.  He took care of the wine on the bill, fair enough since the steak was half eaten.  . . Even though I can't fault the GM for how he handled it, we unfortunately still left with a negative perception of the restaurant because of the outright rudeness of the previous manager.  Her name is Amanda, and she has no business working in the service industry.
Dinner was amazing. Very fun atmosphere. The staff was very attentive and took great care of us. Can't wait to go back !
We wanted to try here after watching Hells Kitchen for a few series, and as my parents were in town we booked a few months in advance. . When we arrived they were running behind, but not a problem as we checked out the bar. . We were seated at one of the booths by the kitchen (well worth the wait), and presented with a fantastic steak selection and explanation. We all decided on the tasting menu, and as my wife is pregnant, the head chef even agree to cook the beef Wellington medium well. The barman made a fantastic non alcoholic cocktail also so we all felt very much spoiled. I would recommend coming here for a nice meal or special occasion.
Great food , nice place and great service!!! Will recommend . The highlight of my trip
We ordered unbelievable sauteed brussel sprouts, sauteed mushroom, . seriously outstanding Beef Wellington & steak, unbeatable cappuccino.. Great service, and romantic booth seat upstairs.. Well worth spending every penny in a special night here :). Best meal EVER!
Let me start our by first saying that I am a big fan of Gordon Ramsay!  We were very excited to try out his restaurant. . . We had a 4:30 reservation on 08/03/14 and were seated promptly. The first thing that I noticed was how dark it was and how pulsating the music was. I love fast pulsating music but not when I want to sit down and have a nice relaxing meal with my significant other.. . We started with a nice bottle of wine and then ordered the Market Green Salad which was awesome.. . Next we both ordered the American Filet with Alaskan King Crab legs.  We asked for the filet to be butterflied and cooked med-med rare.  It was perfectly cooked but it was over seared on the outside.  The Crab Legs were perfect!. . We had sauteed spinach and sauteed mushrooms as our sides. These were awesome but came out lukewarm and quickly grew cold from there.. . We also had a baked potato which was awesome and they used pork belly instead of bacon.  It was delicious! . . The service was outstanding and we really enjoyed our server.. . I would love to give 5 stars but the over seared filet, lukewarm sides, dark to the point that you could not read the menu or see your food very well and the fast pulsating music knocked it down to 3 stars.  I wanted to give 2 stars but the service and quality of food bumped it up.. . I expected better knowing Gordon's standards.
Outstanding food.... The also offer a Hells Kitchen tasting menu
Came here on a Monday night. The atmosphere is nice and the service was excellent. We ordered the Foie Gras appetizer which was very good. We ordered the Bone-In Rib Eye 24 oz Steak which was huge and cooked perfectly. We got the bone marrow as a side which complemented the steak well.. . I ordered the beef wellington but it lacked seasoning which was a little disappointing. There is a lot of hype about this dish, especially with the price and time required for its preparation, but I did not want to finish the second half of it. . . We ordered creamed spinach on the side which tasted okay. I hate to mention this because this is a really nice establishment, but we later found a 2" piece of plastic wrapper buried in it when finishing the rest of our meal in the hotel room. We don't normally treat ourselves to a fine meal but the night that we did, did not impress us.
Waiter took his time coming by after we sat down, then only brought us the tasting menu because the full menu was "too much to handle all at once". . Took us all of 30 seconds to read the five-item tasting menu, then we sat around waiting for the server come back. 20 minutes later, we got up and walked out.. . Completely different experience from Aureole, where we ate the night before.
The food was decent, service was outstanding for the most part. We had a couple different really tasty dishes. We ordered the Osso Buco as our main entree but we're not impressed. The service was a bit more aggressive than is required for a 4-star restaurant.
Best meal ever! We did the appetizer and side dish circuit so as not to eat too heavy before night life. Last reservation is 1015. Pork belly with cheese grits, foie gras, oysters on half shell , Mac and cheese with truffles and spinach all yummy! Impressed!
I am sold on this beef wellington.  It was awesome.  Flavor was perfect as it melted in your mouth.  I can't wait to come back to Vegas to give it a try again.  Lets not forget dessert.  Sticky toffee pudding.  I recommend pouring all the brown butter sauce on the pudding.  yummmmmmy.  Might need a coffee with it if you got room.
So far the good has been good but it is very loud!  Hard to hear the waiter or my dinner partner sitting directly across from me.  The music needed to be turned down.  Very frustrating and stressful experience.
I am a fan of Ramsay and let me say I got what I paid for. Tried the beef Wellington plate. It was worth the wait of 45 mins! I loved that on the menu it stated how long the plate took to cook, everything tasted great from simple fries to the main entree. We didn't have a reservation but the host advised there was a lounge area available. I had my son and was a bit unsure if it would be appropriate to sit there but they allowed us to look before saying yes. It was 5 little dark tables by the main restaurant and bar, very convenient. More families where seated there throughout the my wait. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is I don't feel the restaurant was design for families, despite the fact we enjoyed our meal and there was other families there next to the lounge are we all seemed a bit uncomfortable. I get it is inside the casino and so are the other 2 Ramsay's restaurants. All 3 are very fancy and the tables are right next to each other, so even if they allow kids it doesn't give room for enjoyment. Loved the food and would definitely come back and pay $140 for 2 people!!
Have never been treated so rudely by someone in my entire life. I have been looking forward to eating at the restaurant my entire vacation. We were on time for our reservations but the table wasn't ready. So they escorted us to the "lounge" where I didn't even order a drink. The bartender asked for my id where I am above the legal age. They made me stand up while my family is at the bar "waiting" for our table when none of us had ordered a drink all because I didn't have my id on me. So disrespectful and embarrassing. . . When I asked the manager if I can sit with my family she told me no. We ended up walking out and she had to have the last word and told us to leave as if we weren't on our way out. I honestly think if Gordon Ramsay were to be there he'd be furious and make sure that lady would be gone.
Gordon Ramsay Steak is an expensive restaurant - don't expect to spend under $100 per person and probably more.  As such it needs to be perfect, and it isn't.. . On the plus side, the steaks were flavorful and the meat quality couldn't be beat.  The service was impeccable, the side dishes top notch, and the water glass constantly refilled. The breads were A-1.  One of our two drinks - a sidecar - was excellent (they use apricot jam but it was still fine), but now to the minuses.  .. . The other drink was pedestrian at best - almost tasteless despite fresh mint and lime.  Their American Kobe beef was very tasty but their standard variety was no better than less costly places.  The music was too modern for my taste and so loud at times that conversation was difficult (the volume kept going up and down).  Even our waiter had trouble hearing our order.. . On balance, Steak was a good experience and better than almost any other restaurant I have been to this year, but even for Las Vegas, it was expensive.  Only a personal visit from Gordon Ramsay would have made it a good value, but alas he was not present.
Went here for our honeymoon. Loved the food. Excellent. Had the bone in ribeye, fantastic (but have had better). The thing that really took away from the experience was the atmosphere. Loud/party music, can't really carry on a conversation. Not ideal for a romantic meal.
In the world of celebrity chefs, Ramsay tops my list. Gordon Ramsay Steak was everything I expected it to be. I left fat and happy. (We won't mention that I arrived fat and happy, too!). . Gorgeous upstairs booth with booth walls that stretched up about 10 feet, overlooking the downstairs area with a wild red glass art piece hanging as the centerpiece of the restaurant. Impeccable food:. --Corn and lobster soup. --Foie gras. --Beef Wellington (the steak was so tender and perfectly cooked!). . A bread plate with 4 types of special rolls/bread and butter topped with salt. Too full to try dessert. My daughter had a french onion soup and some mac and cheese that was to die for. I don't even like mac and cheese. This was so good I'd order it next time.. . A splurge that was well worth every penny. My only request would be for quieter music, but music blasts everywhere at Vegas, so I got used to it. I didn't like it, but I accepted it. Still, that couldn't put a damper on a fabulous meal. I'd go back any day.
Overall food experience not as expected. Table for 6, food took a little bit too long to arrive. Burgers and fries are not the best thing u will ever experience. Salad is just ok. Steak looked nice, but u really pay for the name and fame...
Love it, been there several times now and will continue to return!. Sticky Toffee Pudding= AWESOME!
This was hands-down the best food I've ever eaten. Had the pork belly appetizer, fresh oysters (I'm an oyster connoisseur...these are the best, FRESHEST I've ever eaten) beef wellington, and seafood plate (can't remember the actual name of the dish.) . Drinks were fabulous. Portions were perfect. Oh, and the dessert! Sticky pudding is to die for.. Eating here was an awesome experience...in itself worth the trip.
It's Hells Kitchen-esq with no yelling (I would have liked to have heard some yelling). It's definitely a themed environment. The foie gras was the highlight for me. great drinks, the bread, the butter, the STEAK! It was an awesome experience.
It's a late review but I came here in May 2014. Let me tell you that the dessert was life changing! You have to order that sticky toffee pudding and I'm so glad I did even though we were both really full. . . And I'm the kinda girl that loves Ribeye. Not filet mignon or beef Wellington. The waiter recommended me to get the Rib cap and I was swept head over heels with that piece of meat. Delicious cut! My date ordered Beef Wellington. We also ordered some sides like mushrooms, spinach, Mac and cheese. Nothing was that memorable besides the Foie gras. . . HOWEVER overall, it was salty. Every single dish. If they eased up on the salt, I may have enjoyed it more because the meat was definitely a good cut. But I've had better for that price range. My favorite is still Maestros steakhouse. What earned the 4 star was that memorable dessert- sticky toffee pudding!
I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay and have wanted to eat at one of his restaurants forever. Let me tell you, it was well worth the wait! We had his famous beef wellington, which was to die for! The atmosphere was awesome, servers and waiters were incredibly nice and informative. I can't wait to go back!
This  high end steak place is good but not great, the food is  good, but compared to other high end steak places the flavors can not compare. I ordered the bone in rib eye, it was cooked perfectly but the flavor wasn't so good. I asked for drawn butter as I always do when I order high end steak, instead the waiter offered me a herb butter which  did not taste good ( I later find out I was charged for the 4 slices of butter) .  The service was good  but I  would not recommend this place.
Must say, I am going to be a bit cliche. But I am in the business and this place rocks. Jonah was our server and the food was great. Loud for atmosphere,  but to me that means it's packed for a reason. Mac was good, steak was great, gnocchi was tasty. Pricy, not a place to take the kids for a quick bite but worth every penny.
The food was amazing.  I would have given this 5 stars except that the staff and service were not very good.. . We were seated in the back, offset from the cooking station.  The first problem with this area was this is also the area the servers congregate to place orders and talk.  I watched multiple servers talk after we were seated (including our own) and ignore us for a few minutes so that they could continue their conversation.  Because I was facing the serving station, I watched all of the interactions between staff - instead of my husband.  We were here on our honeymoon and the staff interactions drew my attention away from my new spouse.. . The second issue I had with the staff was the distinction between servers and busers.  Our buser appeared to be an African immigrant and was treated very poorly by the servers.  I watch multiple servers yell at him, and tell him to keep up with his work as they laughed and carried on.  He was still very jovial in spite of the fact that he was constantly yelled at.  He treated the guests (and us) far better then our server, but I was highly disturbed by the treatment.  I watched one server pick up a dirty napkin from a table and throw in on a pile of clean napkins that this gentleman was folding and walk away.  The "class disparity" is just unacceptable.. . My final issue with the server is two-fold: first, the server was not clear about the difference between bottled water and tap water.  We had no idea we ordered bottled water until we got a bill for $9/bottle.  Second, I told the server I had a nut allergy and he served me bread with nuts.  When I asked him if there were nuts in the bread, he blamed the African buser who came over and apologized.. . The food was excellent (by far the best steak I have ever had), but I really wish the experience was a better one.
GR Steak has been on my to do list for quite sometime. It took a guys' night and a birthday to finally get us to come in. As locals, we can appreciate celebrity chefs, but tend to save them for the special occasions. When I had made the reservations, it was rather easy. When it came time to alter them, it became a hassle. We had people drop off, join on, and all over the place. The restaurant took my credit card number for our large party and warned us about the $25 per person charge if we failed to notify them about any changes before the dining date.. . When the day came, our group came in spurts and so some of us waited at the bar until a majority came. Once sat, we saw that we were upstairs in the more private style rooms. Everyone must have been doing guys' night because it was a room full of men enjoying steaks. . . My biggest issue with our dining experience has to do with seating. The flat seating with larger parties of 6 or more tends to slow down service. It took some time from getting sat to being able to order drinks. Part of it was due to our party not being complete, but sitting with beverages would have made it unnoticeable. I like the pace of the dining experience. Instead of pushing us to dine and get out, we were allowed to converse as we dine. The meat cart came around and the explanation of each cut and what makes them unique for varying palates was informative.. . The drinks are presented on an Ipad. Their selection of whiskey, bourbons, and scotches is well rounded. Bookers, Glenlivet 12, and Oban 15 range from $12-$14. . . For our table of seven; three ordered the 24oz. bone in ribeyes, 2 6oz. beef wellingtons, 1 14oz. NY strip, and an 8oz. filet. The wellington is prefaced with a 45 minute cooking time and a medium rare temp. After our late start, some of us were getting antsy about timing, but it was not a huge deal. The temp was over medium, but the filet was tender and the puff pastry was not too thick. Paired with the bourbon cream corn, it was enjoyable. I ended up splitting with one of my friends who got a ribeye and enjoyed his steak immensely. Especially with the roasted bone marrow. The topping of foie gras is beautiful as well. We also got the loaded baked potato, brussel sprouts, asparagus, and mushrooms for sides to share. There was some leftovers on most of the items, but I made sure to clear the corn and bone marrow. . . We were all in pain by the time dessert came around. This was not a light meal by any means. I wish I had room for sticky toffee pudding, but all I could take was an espresso. Their coffee service comes with their complimentary ABC spoons. A for Amaretto white chocolate, B for Bailey's milk chocolate, and C for Chambord dark chocolate. They are shots encased in a bonbon and delicious.
Get a reservation early, but the full menu is also served in the lounge.  Rather humorously if you order a lot given the small tables.  . . By the way, am I alone in thinking beef wellington is an antique food from the '70s that's normally served at places with faux mahogany walls, red pleather booths and plastic tablecloths?  It's like the instagram "1977" filter for food.  . . Or has this been a thing all along, and I'm just not that cool?  Wait, no don't answer that.
I'm surprised that I find myself writing this review. To start, I don't eat red meat. On top of that, I much prefer a little hole-in-the-wall to a restaurant boasting a chef's name. That being said, trying Gordon Ramsay's Beef Wellington was on my boyfriend's bucket list, so here I am. . . First off, the staff at Steak are incredibly accommodating. We originally made a reservation for three, but my sister ducked out at the last minute. Not a problem for them. We also showed up about 25 minutes early and were seated at the bar first. When our table was ready, they allowed us to finish up our cocktails and appetizer before we headed upstairs. By the time we reached our table, I had managed to convince my sister to join us after all. Our server was incredibly flexible with us yet again. Likewise, they were very welcoming to my non-red-meat-eating soul, as they explained the options for me and adjusted our selection of breads to have fewer featuring pancetta and more loaded with truffles! The table in front of us further evidenced their accommodating nature. The woman seated across from us didn't find her chair to be comfortable, so they substituted it for another style of chair. When that wasn't to her liking and she traded seats with her husband (right back to the original throne-like chair), they switched the table setting around for her. Please don't be that person, but, if you must, the folks at Steak will take care of you!. . On to the food and drinks: The cocktails were excellent. I ordered a Southside, and was made a Sidecar by mistake, but I enjoyed it thoroughly so I completely excused that. (When I actually got a Sidecar, that was delicious too.) We decided to start with the Truffle Mac N' Cheese as a an appetizer. Great call! Very rich and creamy. To kill time before my sister arrived, we split a Caesar Salad. Very tasty, though $17 for six unchopped pieces of lettuce and a few croutons makes me want to die a little inside. Ah, the irony of fancy food, more money, less food. The dinner roll selection was delicious. The Beef Wellington lived up to my boyfriend's high expectations, while the Fisherman's platter was a nice sampler of salmon, lobster, scallops, mussels, and Ahi tuna for me. My sister's Fish and Chips was spot on as well.. . All in all, we had a great dinner experience at Steak. It'll cost you, but it's worth savoring!
So I decided to give this place another try. This experience was totally different from the first one and some of it was the food but some of it was the awesome server we had. . . I had my original reservation at 6:30 PM and called at 4 PM to see if I can change it to 6:00 and they accommodated me. . . I ordered the gnocchi appetizer. I thought it was OK by bf liked them more than I did. There was something in that dish that I wasn't sure what it was. I think it was a mushroom but it was very chewy.. What made this meal was the rib cap steak, it was way better than the porterhouse! It was seasoned perfectly and cooked just the way I asked, med. I also love their fingerling potatoes here. Some of them are fried I think and some are roasted, so I enjoy the different textures.  The asparagus has pesto so those are always good. The mushrooms were just OK as well as the peppercorn sauce. My bf loved both though.. . What made the meal was dessert! I had the peanut butter chocolate dessert; however, what was brought was the bread pudding. This time the wrong order was left on the table for us to enjoy and they still brought the correct dessert. Both desserts were delicious but the peanut butter one was better.. . Overall, I am glad i gave this place a second chance and will probably go again.. . The cool this about this place is if you show your players card (for that brand of hotels) they give you a discount on the food.
My girlfriend and I had been looking forward to having her birthday dinner here for weeks.  But we were having such a great time in Vegas, that when the day came, we got to our table around 8:30, with tickets for a show at 10.  When we quickly decided on an entree, I was very impressed that our server Donny picked up on the fact that we were in a hurry.  He asked when the show was, and put us at ease that not only would we make it, but that he would also make sure the birthday dessert came out of the kitchen right on time.  I just have to say that, part of the reason I'm so impressed is that we had an amazing meal (seriously, exceptional food) with time to get to the show, but the more surprising, important thing is that we had a server who was perceptive, confident and proactive enough to really make us feel comfortable so we could enjoy the experience.  Thanks Donny!
We went here based on the positive reviews, but I have to say that this place is overrated and overhyped. My husband and I went there for dinner and waited almost 30 minutes to be seated even though we had made a reservation well in advance. The waiter we had was standoffish, didn't make an effort to have a conversation with us or even smile! He also asked if we wanted sparkling water or still, which I assumed meant tap, so I selected the latter; later on we found out that the water alone cost $9! . . I didn't think the bread was anything special either and seemed too greasy. We ordered the jumbo prawn appetizer to share which was okay; I got the rib cap and my husband selected the American eye, which was essentially rib eye wrapped in bacon. His steak was cooked unevenly while mine was medium rare, the way I wanted it. I can't say that the rib cap was the best steak I ever had, but it wasn't bad either. On the other hand, the two side dishes were mediocre (the creamed corn was way too sweet as if they had emptied a bag of sugar in it and the macaroni and cheese tasted bland). I thought the dessert that everyone raved about (toffee pudding) was good but the accompanying ice cream tasted strange (too salty). I wouldn't return for the food since it was too expensive for what we got.
Everything here from the wait staff, to the decor, to the open kitchen to the food was beyond amazing.  It was by far the best steak dinner I have ever had and the sides were perfection as well(mac n cheese and sauteed spinach) even the bread and butter plate was exquisite,  best I have ever had. The wine list was amazing...something on there for everyone and for everyones budget.  I will go to Vegas just to eat here and do nothing else.
My wife and I had the Hell's Kitchen limited edition tasting menu with the wine pairing... . . It started out with a deep fried breaded quail egg as an amuse bouche, it was ok... Then it proceeded to an octopus salad, which was hopefully over cooked as opposed to stale, it was chewy and rubbery. When we pointed it out to our waiter, he did nothing about it... The Wellington was good and the desert was good, it was Ramsay's signature sticky toffee pudding... . . Overall the food was underwhelming, over-priced, the sommelier was disinterested and unengaging, and the wine pairing mismatched and cheap, the service was decent but the waiters weren't invested or caring about the quality of the food... At the end of the meal you get a signed Gordon Ramsay menu, which is a cool novelty! Almost $600 later and that's really all you're left with. I don't usually write reviews, good or bad, in this case both my wife and I had really enjoyed Ramsay's tasting menu at the London, NYC - so we had high expectations! We were thoroughly disappointed! . . Stay away from the HK tasting menu, not worth it!
The food was great! Beef Wellington for me and rib eye bone in steak for hubby. He also added the bone marrow (which is too rich for me), but he loved it. All the food was good, but I think we over ordered! 3 appetizers, 2 sides from our meal and a dessert, couldn't finish it! But overall a great experience!
First we started with 3 different kinds of Oysters, flown in fresh. which were all plump and with the different sauces were amazing.  For my main, I hadthe Beef Wellington (perfectly seasoned and cooked,  thank you Gordon!) and my wife had the rib eye steak.  She was going to have the Wagyu beef, but the waiter correctly advised her not to have that cut if she was not used to a lot of marbling, even though the rib eye was cheaper.. . Our sommelier, Jessica Waugh was very memorable since not only did she advised my wife to get a cheaper Brunello than she was going to order, which was incredible.  She was also nice enough to come back to the table and when we said what fans we were of Gordon Ramsay, she went out of her way to make sure we got to take home a couple of souvenirs.  Well done Jessica, and I told you I would post on Yelp!. . The dessert was the signiture sticky toffee pudding, which was very bad for my waistline but was worth worh cheating.. . We cannot wait to come back, but reserve early, this place is very busy.
We've been fans of Ramsay's tv shows and had always wanted to actually taste his food. We found ourselves in Vegas, staying at the Paris.  We finally had our chance to enjoy a Ramsay steakhouse and we were not disappointed.  The famous beef Wellington was not of this world. Amazing. Kobe A5 beef - melt in your mouth. Creamed corn, mushrooms, Mac and cheese, dear god it was all frigging awesome.  You don't get flavors like these cheaply and it was not cheap. But who cares?!  This was a wonderful experience and we can't wait to get back!
Ate probably the best meal I have ever had. I didn't do the Hells Kitchen menu and opted to pick my own dishes since I wants to try multiple apps, which the HK menu doesn't allow. . I got the Wellington and highly suggest that for everyone. It is the signature steak dish. Probably the best cooked piece of meat I have ever ate. Very flavorful. . I also had the risotto, scallops and crab cake apps. All were amazing. . Service was major league. I like the steak choice presentation. Decor was appropriate as well as the lighting. Bar area could have been larger.
OVERVIEW: I went back and forth debating if I wanted to spend the money at GR Steak and figured I'd check this off my food bucketlist. Although service is amazing, it's pretty pricey and the food was good but not mind shattering.  Came out to a lil over $250 w/tip for the two of us. Would come back only for the dessert!. . LOCATION: Inside the Paris Casino. It has a huge "Gordan Ramsay Steak" sign so you can't miss it. If you're walking in from the Bally's walkway, it's to the right once you hit the casino. If you're coming in from the Eiffel Tower entrance from the strip, walk all the way to the back of the casino and it's on your left. . . RESERVATIONS: We booked on Thurs at 10pm. We got there a little early around 9:30 to see if they could get us in and were told the table will be ready at 10pm but we were welcome to stay at the bar. No biggie. We decided to walk around and gamble a bit and came back at 10pm. . . SEATING: Once we got in, our hostess told us the lights above mimic Gordan's hand movements as he makes the beef wellington. Cool? The lighting explains why most of the photos on yelp suck. The red lights give everything a dark red color to photos but using flash is too bright and distracting. . . SERVICE: AMAZING!  When I made the reservations, I made a comment it was my bday and everyone from the hostess to our waiters all wished me a happy bday :) (no freebies but still nice) Great that they actually read those comments! Both my bf and I were kind of fish out of water, a bit awk because we normally don't go to "fancy" restaurants. It was a bit overwhelming for us because it seemed like we had a couple servers. But the waiters were not snooty at all and nice! Heads up, they will come by and wipe down the table to keep it clean between each food course. I thought we were just super messy but they seemed to do that to most tables. Also just like on Hell's Kitchen, they served our entrees and side dish all at the same time. This is why we had multiple servers so they could have two people serve at the same exact time. . . FOOD:. Bread: Comp bread. Sadly, I wasn't as in love with the bread as my fellow yelpers. There was variety of diff kinds and we actually didn't finish it. The butter was actually kind of hard so it was difficult to spread. . Drinks: HK Antioxidant - it was good; very refreshing. Appetizer: Half Dozen Oysters. These came 3 diff types (2 of each kind pre-seasoned)  2 types were East Coast and 1 was West Coast.  It was the first time I had oysters and they were SO good. They also came with a tiny bottle of Tabasco and side sauces. OMG it was so good and fresh! . Main course: BEEF WELLINGTON FOR 1 - I was confused on yelp by the photos; some showed 1 piece and others showed 2 pieces. Mine did come with 2 pieces. I gave one to my bf and he gave me half of his AMERICAN RIB CAP. . The beef wellington was honestly a bit clumsy to eat but the beef was SO tender, juicy and perfectly medium rare. I personally thought the meat itself was a little under-seasoned but it was pretty good. The puff pastry on top was perfect! The potato puree was more just a decoration, literally a couple of bites if you scrape it together. Vegetables were ok, they were strangely sweet and just a couple bites as well.   . American Rib Cap- just comes as is. We were both a bit disappointed as it was tougher than we both had thought. It was ok but nothing amazing. We both preferred the wellington :). Side: Mac & Cheese - there are so many rave reviews about this mac& cheese on yelp but neither of us liked it :( It was bit cold when we got it and it was too dense and flavors didn't go well w/our meats. . . DESSERT: Sticky Toffee Pudding- don't miss out! This dessert itself deserves a 5 star. I was worried about it being a "date cake" but doesn't take like it! Perfect sweetness w/the icecream together. Perfect dessert to share for 2. . . . TIPS AND SUCH:. The wellington did take about 45 mins and they will time all the food to get to your table at the same time so unfortunately everyone else will wait on yours ;) It's not too bad since you'll get bread but plan on getting an app too. . . They have a Total Rewards pricing, so make sure you to bring your card. We weren't staying at Paris but it looked like you could charge to your room if you are. If you don't have a TR card, get one for free at any TR hotel; Bally's and Paris both have a counter.. .

I celebrated my 50th birthday here in October with 5 of my closest friends.  I had to make a reservation about 4 weeks in advance and got an early sitting at 5 PM. They gave me a reservation number which was efficient but told me if I cancelled after 24 hrs my credit card would be charged for $50 for each person.  I was Ok with that. . From the moment we were greeted it was a wonderful experience.  I felt like I was on the Titanic.  I was greeted and wished a very happy birthday by the hostess and she took us to the elevator and we went upstairs where they had prepared our table which was a booth and two chairs added to the end.  Once we got off the elevator, staff were there to great us and each and everyone of them ( even those who were not serving us ) wished me happy birthday. It was first class!  Our server was Donny and he did an amazing job!  He ensured we were all a happy by starting us off with cocktails with the famous iPad.  I had done research on the menu and already knew what I wanted to order.  I had the English Garden and Pims cocktails.  The English Garden was refreshing, it had cucumber and basil.  And i couldn't resist the Pims, having lived in UK for many years, it is my favorite!  Most of my friends ordered a salad to start but I ordered the Lobster starter which was fabulous!   They of course brought out the meat tray and presented what was available . The tray even had mirrors on it so you could see the cut from anywhere you were sitting.  For main courses we ordered the Kobe Steak ( amazingly tender!), the beef wellington( brilliant!) and one of my friends ordered the salmon which she said was the best she ever had!  Then there were the sides. . We ordered the mushrooms which were out of this world! Brussel Sprouts were good, spinach was cooked to perfection ( we ordered two) , but the best was the mac and cheese!  I don't normally like mac and cheese but seriously this was amazing!! I had never tasted mac and cheese like that!  The service was impeccable. We were never disturbed unless we really needed to have our water or glasses filled or there was another dish to order.  The service was first class!  Even their general . manager stopped by to wish me a Happy 50th birthday and gave me his card. Their staff did a great job ! By the time dessert came around we were so full we just couldn't do it.  We did order the Sticky Toffee and all shared.  It was incredible.  When they brought the French pressed office and chocolate liquor spoons well that was it!  It was such a nice touch to an amazing dinning experience!. Donny our waiter actually made our evening.  He took pictures and let us take pictures with him.  He offered to take us down to the kitchen but we weren't allowed to go behind the counter.  The only disappointing factor of the evening was their famous chef, Christina Wilson was not very accommodating when we asked for a picture as a group to celebrate my 50th, nor was she willing to even give an autograph on at least one of our Gordan Ramsey bags that Donny gave to us all. . Considering the amount of money I spent there, I would think she would have been happy to do that for us. But no....she was too busy stuffing that bake potato with sour cream....and looked stressed just managing that. . Overall, it was an amazing dinning experience.  We are all still talking about that night and each of my friends told me its the best dinning experience they have ever had!!!!!!  BRAVO CHEF RAMSEY!!!  Can't wait to try your Pub and Grill at Caesars!
Simply divine. Impeccable service and delicious food. The Beef Wellington was superb. Definitely worth every penny. I love Gordon Ramsey's shows, and having seen how much he gets on other people for quality of ingredients and customer service I had high expectations. Both his Steak restaurant and Burgr place definitely liveup to them though.
This has to be the best meal I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Our group of four didn't make reservations but there was a four top in the bar when we got there. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful. The bread starter was a perfect start. I ordered the roasted chicken while my friends each got the filet (one got the Kobe/Wagyu filet). We split the Bourbon cream corn, loaded baked potato and mac and cheese. . A sign of any good meal for us is when conversation stops. Our meal here did that and more. The moaning and oh-ing and ah-ing made for interesting looks.. The ticket was $325 for us but totally worth the experience. In my opinion as well as my friends, it was worth every last penny.. Gordon Ramsey is correct. Fresh, simple food done properly. A total win in my book.
Big fan of Gordon Ramsay. I have visited this steak house three times since it opened. Always a pleasure and would definitely return.. . Modern decor and good ambiance. Always seems packed, would highly recommend making reservations ahead of time. Never had to wait very long, hostesses seemed on point. Good customer service and great bread choices. . . Have tried 3/4 of all the appetizers on the menu and very pleased. The yellowtail starter was my favorite.. . The Beef Wellington, Fish & Chips, and Fisherman's Stew were all good entree choices. Highly recommended.. . The Sticky Toffe Pudding is to die for! Must try if you like sweet desserts. Would come back just for this alone.
On a recent trip to Loss Wages, I decided to see what the hype was about Gordon Ramsey's Steak. . My dog Steve was on a winning streak playing Baccarat at Caesar's so a companion and I ventured across the street to Steak located in Paris' casino. Not having reservations, our only choice was to eat in the bar/lounge area. The table was nice and the chairs were comfy, the only complaint I had was the music was very loud and very thumpy. . I ordered the Bone in ribeye and she ordered the petite filet we shared the bourbon creamed corn and the mashed potatoes. . My steak was ordered medium rare plus, but came out closer to rare, which was ok but not as I would expect in a high end establishment. I was afraid to send it back fearing I would hear "Bloody 'ell you f'ing donkey"  so I ate it anyway. The lady's steak was dare I say ordered well done so I cannot comment on it although she enjoyed it. . The creamed corn had good flavor but a bit too sweet for me, the potatoes were mediocre at best and both sides had an off putting consistency of baby food. . Overall it was about a three star rating but no where near a stellar 5 stars I was hoping I would give it. . In comparison for the locals in Cincinnati, any of Jeff Ruby Steakhouse's (Especially The Precinct)  would put the angry Brit to shame.
We dined here last night for my boyfriends birthday. The food was amazing. The service was also amazing. . . We ordered the chorizo stuffed lobster and the pork belly for appetizers. Both were equally delicious. . . For main courses I ordered the beef Wellington and my boyfriend ordered the bone in rib eye. I'm a total fan of Hell's Kitchen which is why I ordered the Wellington. It certainly did not disappoint. The meat literally melted in your mouth. . . While it was expensive, I felt it was worth every penny. I called ahead of time and ordered a dessert for his birthday. The sticky toffee pudding is spot on. ORDER IT! (If you have room) . . Great place to celebrate a special occasion!!
My opinion of GR Steakhouse was about 4.5 stars. My girlfriend and I went there for dinner, with 9:45 reservation. We were promptly seated and to my surprise the restaurant was fairly busy and lively even on a Monday evening. . . The service was good. I did feel the interaction between the employees and customer was a little awkward though. Long paused communication with stiff presentation. Overall though, not too detracting from the experience.. . The food was amazing! A nice beer selection, an equal wine and liquor selection as well. Everything on the menu is a la cart and in my opinion, fairly priced for what you get. If you don't know steak cuts, don't worry they wheel a steak cart out to show you what they have. My girlfriend and I got the filet and rib cap steak (medium and medium-rare), and they were outstanding - perfect color. I thought the filet was the better of the two. We also ordered crab legs - great portion, already cut, and very tasty. We shared a plate of bone barrow as well - first time and it was delicious. . . Sides are big enough to share between two or even three people and everyone can get seconds. The cream corn is amazing! I recommend. The potato puree and asparagus were good, too.. . Dessert was phenomenal. Get the sticky toffee pudding.. . Expect to pay about $100-150 per person, depending on how many sides or drinks you order.
I had the wagu filet and it was amazing.  The truffle mac and cheese was great, too, but I was too full to eat it.  I ended up giving my leftovers to a group of drunk guys outside a strip club.  My friend had the same filet and the baked potato, which was also delicious.  . . Our reservations were at 10pm.  We arrived a little early and were seated in the bar and ordered drinks while we waited.  I'm pretty sure we were seated for dinner right on time, or shortly after.  . . The dining services was REALLY slow, though.  I think maybe it was because he was waiting for the cart of meat to bring over, but I already knew what I wanted and didn't need to look at a cart of raw meat.  The service should not have been that slow.. . I would go back again but next time a little more hungry and a little less drunk.  Oh, and I spent well over $100 for my food.  Probably closer to $150.
Over priced and service needs help!. . Food was amazing and I suppose you get what you pay for.   22 bucks for a pot pie is a bit much however the charge for bread was over the top.  It's easy to over charge because your Gorden Ramsey however, was the experience worth it.  NO.  . . Severs and front host really need training on how to do their jobs.  . . Try smiling and responding rather than on your cell phones.  Try asking if you've been helped rather than looking at the celebs passing by.   . . I do not recommend this place not because of the bad price points but the experience was less than desired.
When my folks were here to visit, and staying at the Paris, we all agreed to and were excited to try this place.  Menu, pricey but attractive.  Wine list, quite good.  Service, spot on.  Food very good, not great.  Ambiance, is the downfall.  Very noisy place, with the music and lighting, more like a nightclub.  I guess that's to appeal to the new steampunk millenial hipsters. Usually going out to eat entails conversation, here, though possible, it is difficult, noise and seating is close, lacks privacy that you can expect at restaurants of the same price and caliber.  At first, they tried to sit us at tables facing the kitchen and between the staff, banging plates, and radiant heat, we had to go to the Maitre'd and ask for a better option.  They did take care of it and we only had to wait about 10 minutes over the 15 minutes past our reservation time we were seated. So 7:45 became 8:15, but that wasn't an issue for us. In my honest opinion this place is more about a celeb name and the kind of place to go and see and be seen/at the scene and post your status to social media to impress friends.  I had suggested we go to Flemings on W. Charleston, which is much more what I am used to as a dining experience.  When it's dark, club music playing, weird lighting gave everything a reddish hue, maybe that's a Hell's Kitchen thing??? . Some of the other diners were trying way too hard to look important and chic.  . Wines we chose were a 2012 Patz and Hall Dutton Ranch Chard, was excellent as expected along with the 2011 Robert Biale Black Chicken Ranch Zinfandel.. Our server Humberto was really exceptional.. Total tab was a little over 500 US dollars for 3 people.  Wine, 2 American/Kobe skirt steaks and 1 NY strip,  2 orders of oysters and a soup, 1 dessert and 1 double expresso.  Plus the vino of course.  Which was $200 for the 2 bottles.. Was it good, yes, could it have been better, also yes.  . For the price, I'd recommend, Flemings, Ruth Chris, Del Frisco's or one of many other great options in town.
This was truly a restaurant experience!  My boyfriend and I were invited in to the bar to enjoy a drink before our reservation time, and the service was amazing.  He were then escorted to a second floor table, and given a few details about the amazing story behind the decor.. . Dinner began with an absolutely wonderful server named Dennis who made the entire night even better.  He was extremely attentive to every request, he was energetic and very courteous - what a wonderful representative for your business!. . We enjoyed some incredibly artistic bread with specialty butter, the best macaroni and cheese I have ever had, and then, the world's best Beef Wellington.. . Beef Wellington.. SO GOOD!. . Service concluded with a autographed picture of Gordon Ramsay and a satiated appetite.  Well done!
We had an amazing dinner here. Our server Matthew was excellent. They recommended a tasty bottle of zin based on our preferred price point.  Each course surpassed each other. It was truly an incredible experience!
Nothing has changed..excellent service, excellent food..very pricey but it's all worth it.  This time I had the ceasar salad, filet (medium rare), Mac and cheese, foie gras, bone marrow and the sticky toffee pudding...my plate was empty when I left and my tummy was very happy
