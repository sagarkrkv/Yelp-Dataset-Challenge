Oh I don't know... It's my favorite place on the planet!! I love it here! Great food, excellent beer (especially the hop knot it's my favorite) and fantastic service. . .  If you're a wings fan (in which I'm a huge fan) you will love this place even more. I'm traditionally a hot wings person and not bbq. But this is the one establishment that has caught my attention with their unique oatmeal stout wings. That's right! a dozen wings doused with their own oatmeal stout sauce ( created from their delicious oatmeal stout beer), Simply amazing! Oh, I must add, if you're a MN Vikings fan this is the place to watch the game on Sundays. It's kind of a MN establishment, which is cool with me since I'm from MN:-))! . .  But really it doesn't matter where you're from. If you come to AZ and are into craft beer and good food this is the place to check. I promise that it won't disappoint!
Me and my girls went here today for dinner after viewing a distillery. We carpooled but parking was almost non existent. We gambled by parking at the business next door. We were seated immediately. It was fairly hot and muggy inside even though there was a fan on. They need to get air conditioning. I was sweating buckets. The waitress was nice but she needed to speak up a little louder. It was pretty noisy inside with the music and other noise.  I ordered a bleu cheese burger, not the one offered on the menu that has bacon in it. I don't eat bacon. She accommodated me. I ordered a drink called the Peachy Keen because I had just come from the Arizona Distillery and Four Peaks uses their bourbon in that drink. I'm not going to lie here, the drink was not good to me because it had a strong beer taste and I don't like beer. They use their Peach ale in that drink and it overpowers the other flavors including the bourbon. Don't get it if you don't like the taste of beer. My burger, which came out as I ordered it (medium well) was delivered really fast. I don't know how you make a medium well burger that fast. Anyway, It was not juicy, it was not bad, it was not great, it was edible. My friends liked their food. One of my friends ordered a quesadilla and she said it was good. My other friend ordered nachos and it was huge. She ate some and took the rest home. Anyway, I don't like leaving bad reviews, but my experience was blah.
Four Peaks Brewing Co = Arizona's sweetheart brewery and every ASU Sun Devils' dream come true.. . I came here for my buddy's farewell party.  I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of beer but when in Rome...   I had order myself a Four Peaks Peach Ale and shared a five-layer nacho dip with my buddies.  It was a busy Saturday night so service was actually pretty decent for it being packed.  Others had order more appetizers for everyone to share but I mainly sat around nursing my light and surprisingly delicious ale while munching on nachos.  Four Peaks is a super popular brewery considering ASU is close by.  Kudos on the owners picking such a prime location.  They really know their targeted audience well.  Parking is a nightmare so try to carpool.  The bathrooms are clean and the food portions and quality are decent.  I wouldn't mind stopping by again!
Was in and out, but this place was a must stop for me! Had their sampler flight ($10) and left with a growler of Raj IPA and a 6-pack of Hop Knot. I love microbreweries!
My friends and I happened upon this place, and we had a great time celebrating my birthday there. It was still cool enough at the time to enjoy the outdoor patio seating, which made for a laid-back Saturday afternoon. The three of us just had apps and shared a flight of their brews. I couldn't get enough of the pretzel with some special mustard that must have been infused with crack, and their Hop Knot was very refreshing. I'm also a fan of the peach ale. My friend didn't take to her peach ale mimosa, but I happily polished it off for her!
Four Peaks is the perfect restaurant.  . . The normal menu has the best bar food in the Phoenix area, but there are 3 lunch and three dinner specials daily, as well as Sunday brunch specials, that easily top any other restaurant in the same price range.  The spinach artichoke dip is a highly recommended bar bite.  It is creamy and cheesy and, despite the misleading name, full of both spinachand huge artichoke chunks.  It is paired with heaps off blue and red corn chips and soft, warm beer bread triangles.  It is perfect for sharing with friends.. . Aside from being an excellent restaurant, Four Peaks also happens to be the best brewery in Arizona.  My favorite beer, Raj I.P.A, is super floral and hoppy, with only a slight bitter front end and a smooth, slightly malty finish.  It is the definition of balance and it has a gorgeous dark orange color too.  At 6.9 percent, it will also get you where ever you want to go.  For summer patio drinking, get Peachbru: half Sunbru, half Peach ale, and drink it fast while it is still cold.  . . From top to bottom, the service is always impeccable.  On the rare occasion that service slips, management always ensures that customers never leave unhappy.  . . Four Peaks is my favorite bar in the world.  If it is not yours, it is probably because you have not been yet.
Its a tragedy of the commons with there sides; so many delicious options, pasta salad, fries, salad, we lose sight of how fabulous the Italian Beef Rollup (any of the rollups) truly can be. The beer and atmosphere is what will keep you coming back though. Think Buffalo WildWings. Now, the exact opposite is Four Peaks, less they both are in buildings and have t.v.'s with sports. Oh yeah, Twins suck.
I don't think I could add anything that hasn't been said already. The mix of food and beer is perfect here. All the food I've had keeps me coming back for more, and the beer is such a high quality product I just want to drink it everyday. . . Four peaks is doingit all right and I don't expect that to change anytime soon.
Very nice place to chill with friends and have some good food. Wings are delicious! My husband is a huge fan if the beer selection
This is one of my all time favorite bars and brewery! It was my spot for college and I love it endlessly! The food is to die for (pizza, salads, nachos, etc) and their home brewed beers always make me so very happy!! When I come back to visit AZ I always make a stop back here and I get my growlers filled up w the Peach and Sunbru beers. I love the managers who work there and the ambiance and service is so relaxing and chill! Honestly can't say enough great things about this place! Wish they'd open one in San Diego!
This restaurant is hot, especially in the back.  There is no air conditioning, only swamp coolers, which is especially uncomfortable in August.   We went there for a birthday party during happy hour, the appetizers were pretty tasty, but I was disappointed with the beers that I tried.
Oh my gosh not only is the food AMAZING but their prices are great, good customer service and awesome tasting drinks. Cool atmosphere too, kinda hot in the summer though no AC I don't think.
Definitely the best brewery in Arizona! I believe what makes them stand out among the rest is their food. Great food for a brewery which is not usually the case. Been going there for years now.
Great Food. Great atmosphere and if you get lucky enough to sit in Leah's section you will be treated to a wonderful dining experience.  What a great evening.
The staff was very good - prompt, smiling, and very helpful.  Beer was delicious and lived up to all the other great comments.  Food was mostly pub style with very generous portions.  That being said, it was good food.  We had a large group, so a variety of items were ordered and all were delicious.
If you are looking for the freshest seafood in town, this is the best place to go. The portions are perfect, where you are satisfied but not overwhelmingly stuffed. The food feels more organic and clean in that I feel they use simple ingredients and don't try to add to many "fillers" for taste. If I was to pick anywhere in Birmingham to impress someone, this would be my choice.
Being from ASU, I've been here umpteen times and though the thousands of reviews and the constant flow of college students in and out of this brewery already vouch for this, I'm here to reiterate that this place has amazing food.  It's better than any bar food I've had, huge servings, great fries, great beer, decent prices.  I personally like it better in the summer, when it's a lot less crazy, but for the food, I will brave the crowds.  Also, I've heard great things about the Pumpkin Porter so I'll definitely be back again in September.. . Dishes I recommend: The nacho appetizer - there's lots of it and you won't regret adding meat to it.  The Reuben - my favorite and go-to item on the menu.  The fish and chips - my other go-to item.  The Italian beef beer bread - filling, cheesy, beef.  Need I say more?  Also, the Kiltlifter, the peach beer, and I'm sure many more that I've yet to try. . Try at your own risk: Beer shake - didn't care for it.  It's the only milkshake on the menu.  Grilled chicken beer bread - it was rather dry and a far cry from the Italian beef beer bread
Great place to grab a beer with friends and family. This Arizona brewery boasts a colorful array of beers, with a rotating selection of seasonal brews. The food is fantastic, the service is as quick as it can be for its popularity, and the atmosphere is lively! A must-eat location for Tempe-goer or visitor.
Red Snapper a must.
First time here. Had samples of their beer and was mostly disappointed. Oatmeal stout  was creamy but not much taste. Hefe had hint of lemon flavor but the taste was also to the point of being sour. Kilt lifter had roasted barley favor with caramel as discribed on menu. When I tasted it, the flavor blend just did not work for me. They had a seasonal porter which I kind of like but I have had more favorable porter before. . Food wise, I had the chicken enchilada. Decent. Nothing great but not bad for bar food.
A fun chill place to grab a few drinks and yummy food, and catch up with friends. I love the beer battered fries and all the sandwiches/burgers. I really liked the beer sampler, it's a great way to try different beers, but I always stick with the peach ale. It's so light with just a hint of peach. Very refreshing and addicting! It gets super crowded, and parking is IMPOSSIBLE, but it's all for a reason. This place is very laid back, fun, friendly workers, great food, great drinks.. They're definitely doing something right!!
Amazing food and beer! This is a great place to go for dinner, a date, or just a night out with friends. It's always packed so you need to park a little far away, but it's worth it.
I have been here a few times and each time has been great! I LOVE their beer and the food is good too! This is a great place to hangout after work, watch the game, or just relax. I love going here.. I try to bring anyone who visits me to this place! . . They have a pretty decent happy hour. I do like how it is on the weekends too,which is a perk. . . Tip: Food portions are huge, so plan accordingly! (ex: Nachos can feed an army)
Goog food , great brew , a bit hot inside this place . Tv's are small to watch the game , bathrooms are dirty
Great food, beer, and service. Half peach/half Raj is always a good choice and the spinach artichoke dip, pizzas, and fish and chips are all very good. Can get crowded, but that's the price you pay for a good experience. Definitely try it out!
This restaurant is consistent. Service is fabulous, as is the food. It is seasoned beautifully. The pasta appetizer with the mushroom reduction sauce is insanely good. I always get the black cod because it is unusual to find it on the east coast. My wife had the chicken. This is one of my go to's when visiting Tempe.
I go to four peaks over other restaurants all the time. The main reason is because you know your going to get amazing food along w/ delicious ice cold beer every time.
Great local beer. Try the Hop Knot IPA ... Good pub food and the atmosphere is great got watching football. We have been here a few times and have never been disappointed. Bartenders are very cool and know there beer. Service is great.... Be sure to ask for Victoria, She is a great server  nice and extremely personable.....
I love a trip to Four Peaks! Been coming here for years now! . . Delicious food, craft beers, enjoying the company of your friends ... What more could you ask for? . . In the fall, I find myself here more often as that's when they bust out the Pumpkin Porter. It's even more delicious in a shake . . . Impossible?! . . The Bleu Light Special Burger is my favorite burger on the menu. Get it with the beer battered fries; they're to die for.. . I also love the Five Layer Nacho Dip with Chicken. Just make sure you bring an Army with you (four or more of your buds), because the portion size is ginormous. . . The Brickhouse Wings are just OK. . . Still need to try the legendary Salmon BLT!. . Bring your growler - Trust me, you'll want to bring some beer home. . . The only downside is, they can't fill growlers with Oatmeal Stout (love this one the most out of all their beers ) - something about it not keeping fresh. :( . . Make sure you bring a DD. Drunk driving is for dumbasses who want to get tossed around Tent City like a box of Girl Scout Cookies.. . Don't be deterred from a trip to Four Peaks because of all the ASU youngins - There's good times and even better brews to be had for (legal aged) folks young and old!
