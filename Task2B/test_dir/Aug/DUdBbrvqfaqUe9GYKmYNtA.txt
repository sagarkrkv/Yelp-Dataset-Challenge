Mirage was a bummer. We checked in at 3, and they gave us the wrong room type. They didn't have the requested room ready, so we waited a bit in the casino, and went to our new room about 7. The key did not work, TWICE, and every person we came into contact with was rude and acted as if we were idiots who couldn't open a door. An hour after our initial try the security guard responded to my husband's irritation with rudeness. She wouldn't allow him to finish a sentence and continually contradicted my husband and was condescending. The head of security was more of the same. They were uneducated and crude, and we only wanted to get into a room, that, may I remind you? WE WERE PAYING FOR. The lock on the door was broken, and it wasn't until 10:00 and four different attempts that we got into a room, causing us to miss our show. . . While the hospitality staff was pleasant, and our cabana experience was nice,  the experience with security left a bad taste and ruined it. Paying customers deserve to be treated well. I'm sure that the Mirage is fine as long as there are no snafus, but we were assigned a room with a faulty door lock and treated as if we were criminals who were trying to ruin their day instead of vice-versa. With all of the hotels vying for customers and falling over each other to provide the best customer service, this came as a shock. . We will not be back.
I didn't have a bad experience, but I was underwhelmed during my most recent stay in Vegas. Our room at The Mirage was fine, but nothing special. I did leave the pool rather quickly as I kept getting a whiff of sewage every minute or so. It was really unpleasant. It's a reasonably priced hotel and gets the job done but I don't plan on staying here in the future.
This was the first time I have stayed at the Mirage. The prices were great! They do add the resort fee which can be irritating, I would rather just have one price and have it all included. Seems like just a new way to get another $25 a night. Despite how old this casino is, you would never know it. The rooms are extremly well maintained. No issues what so ever with cleanliness, older stuff, etc. Was very happy. In Vegas we are never in our room long so I prefer the more reasonable rates like they had to the fancy ameneties of other places which is nice if you are in the room a lot but we were not. They do have a really nicely stocked mini bar that has some interesting items in it! Room is good size, shower has great water pressure, and the rooms are quiet. Customer service was fast and friendly checking in. A very long line only took 5 minutes since they had all the counters open helping people check in. . If you stay here, you get a discount at the shows and secret garden which is a nice bonus.
DO NOT BOOK HERE! I paid with points for a bachelorette party and on the day of my arrival had a family emergency land me in the hospital, canceling my trip. When I called to alter the reservation so my friend could still keep the room without me there, I was told I had to call the obscure 3rd party agency that booked it. Mind you, this room is paid in full, under my name, and I'd already changed the room type and check-in time via phone with The Mirage earlier in the week, yet this nasty woman keeps cutting me off to insist NO CHANGES can be made through them directly. (Guess I imagined all that!) Finally, I get the 3rd party agency to call The Mirage and make the changes, only to have them come back and tell me it's actually been at the discretion of the hotel THE WHOLE TIME and they are simply refusing to update the name on the reservation because it's "against their policy", so I'll just have to cancel the room I already paid for and re-book it at a new rate, including a one-night cancellation fee. Are you kidding me!? . . After much argument and nearly three hours of back and forth phone calls, the hotel eventually relented, but I will never stay at this establishment again, and I will make it my personal mission to ensure that everyone I know avoids The Mirage moving forward.
Just stayed here with my boyfriend for three nights from the 12th to the 15th. Originally we weren't going to go on a trip this summer but as soon as we saw some good deals (namely, the prices at the Mirage) we booked our trip as soon as we could. We do not regret it at all! We had a great room for the price we paid, with a nice view of the pool and the rest of the strip, as well as the Rio and Orleans off strip. The room was comfortable, and the bed was amazing! There were, however, two things I did not like about the room. First off, the shower was odd. I don't know if it was the water pressure or the amount of space it had, but shaving in it was very hard - it felt like I could not get enough water on my legs no matter whether I was facing it or facing away from it. No bueno. Secondly, they did not provide a "do not disturb" door sign or other equivalent sign. Not a big deal, but seems weird given that it's a very basic hotel amenity. The rest of the hotel was beautiful. Personally, the atrium in the lobby was my favorite, especially during the daytime. I regret not getting a picture of it. Overall, it was a great hotel, easy to navigate, easy to check in, easy to check out, etc. The staff we encountered were all pleasant and so were most of the guests (watch out for those who will press the buttons for every floor in the elevator, leave the elevator, and leave you and other guests to find out that you get to stop every floor for 16 floors!). We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others, especially if you like the tropical vibe!
This was my third time in Vegas and the second best hotel that I stayed in. The worst was Circus Circus and the best was The Mandalay  Bay. The Mirage was pretty decent, it was clean for the most part and not crazy expensive. I checked out some reviews on Yelp and they weren't too bad so that was a good thing.. . Got there on a Sunday around 11am expecting to wait to check in because check in was at 3 or something. Surprisingly they checked me with no problem so I was happy about that. The employees were pretty nice and helpful which is always a plus in my book. I got to my room and it was a nice size but the bathroom was a little small for my liking. Also the bathtub was just a regular size which is fine because I didn't reserve a suite or anything.. . They have some decent places to eat like a burger spot I went to it wasn't the best burger I had but it was good. The star of that burger spot was the milkshakes which I had a Twinkie shake but it needed more caramel. I didn't spend too much time at the Mirage because I was at the Venetian across the street which has a pretty nice food court. My favorite was the Haagen das ice cream, the pizza and the lobster.. . So if I came back to Vegas would I stay at the Mirage probably not but I did enjoy my stay and it was affordable. There wasn't anything really bad about the Mirage but it wasn't my cup oftea.
Ive been to Vegas twice, and both times have stayed at the Mirage. There is no need to stay elsewhere. You want to talk about the "prime" location, it doesnt get better than this. Right smack in the middle of the strip, easy access to anywhere.. . From the moment my G.F. arrived, the staff is very friendly. We arrived around noon and our room we booked was ready (did not book a strip view because I was going to try for a room upgrade). I cant remember the guys name at the front desk that we had, but when I asked for a room upgrade, he did not hesitate at all and gladly upgraded us. We just had to wait a few hours because the room was not ready. We had no problem with that because that gave us some time to go get some lunch. By the time we were done eating, our room was ready.. . The room was clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, and even though the tv was acting up a tad, no complaints at all with the Mirage. The hotel/casino is very easy to navigate. . . The Mirage pool is the king of pools. Staying at the Mirage just for the pool is worth it. When you see it you completely forget you are in the middle of the desert. It is a complete relaxation atmosphere. The water is the perfect temperature. Especially when you are sitting in the Vegas sun, you just go right into the pool and lounge around. The water temperature is absolutely perfect!. . The pool area fills in very quickly, so if you want a good seat in the prime real estate, make sure to get there as soon as the pool opens. Being there early is totally worth it. A lot of people save chairs for others, and a lot of chairs just sit there with towels on them with noone using them so just scope out the area and wait until you see someone get up. We got to the pool late one day and some little, friendly old lady had saved 7 seats!!! and she was there alone, but when the guy next to her left, she moved over to the end of the row. It was actually really funny to hear talk on the phone and say she had taken 7 seats. As we saw this guy leaving, we walked over and with no hesitation she gladly gave up 2 of her seats for us. . . Not to mention, there are some good food spots for quick eats in the hotel, including BLT burger, Carnegie and Blizz frozen yogurt. When you find a good spot, you stick with it, and both times I have not had any issues with the Mirage. This is my hotel choice and will not even think about staying elsewhere.
Great location, friendly staff, clean rooms, awesome pool, plenty of restaurants.. . Only complaints:. . They need to hire some more employees to help with the cabs out front. The cab line is consistently long and there are always 50 cabs waiting in line. And I don't know what it is about Vegas that makes people load into a cab so slowly. This is a problem at every hotel in Vegas though so I won't hold it against Mirage.. . As in all casinos in Vegas getting any internet through your cell phone is going to be hard/impossible. Even by the pool you can't get your cell phone to connect to internet. They said the rooms had WiFi and it came with the resort fee.... I turned my laptop on a couple times and never had any luck connecting. Or the computer/phone would just report that there were no wifi signals available. So if you were planning on staying here and getting some work done you might want to look elsewhere.
Only 4 people working behind the check in desk at 6pm on aTuesday with over 40 people waiting in line to check into their rooms? Come on Mirage.. . Also, if you plan on using the internet in the room, prepare for slow reception and dropped off connections. Bad hotel if you plan on needing the internet in your room for doing business during your stay.
excellent hotel. confortable. beds and clean sheets and confortabeis. however not take anything from the fridge to put your things because they will be charging even if you do not consume anything. The internet is included in the resort fee, but does not work, you can not access the internet.
Location is good, rooms are ok, my expectations were much higher compared  it to other hotels in the strip. We had breakfast at the Carnegie deli..wrong decision... service and food are below average. . Food is expensive not worth it for your money.  We had a breakfast with a bagel. .we ask the cream cheese and the waitress respond it that will be $2.99 more..for a Cream cheese?.
We have been to vegas three years in a row and this was our best trip yet! I can say it is solely for the mirages sake!! . . We were there for five days and stayed at the mirage a majority of the time! The pool was beautiful and big, service was awesome and the drinks were a good price. Comment would be that they don't refill the big drinks, which can be a bummer because we ended up with six large cups we couldn't do anything with. We also ate at the poolside eatery and it was really good! People might say something about price, but their prices are worth what you pay for. You just can't go to vegas and expect things to be five dollars...it won't be worth it!! . . Rooms were nice, but our room had some issues. That's okay though because they made up for it, and that's all I can ask for! Plus, see the concierge (I think I spelt that right?) across from the check in desk for tickets to the Beatles love show, even if you aren't staying there... You get a discount for being a m life member period!! Get your tickets there because the show love was out of this world amazing!!!! A must see! . . We went to the secret habitat as well, and I painted with the dolphins! Amazing experience!! You have to give it a go!! When in Vegas.... Haha have fun with it!! . . One last thing, overall rating is awesome. All the drinks, service, manageability and customer service is overall great! Room service is not expensive, people treat you well, and the casino is beautiful. Please don't overlook this casino... I like it much better than the Bellagio!
What a great experience. (Perhaps I am biased since I got a comped room thanks to playing myvegas slots on Facebook but it would have been awesome even if I had payed.) The line was long but it moved quickly. We were able to check in around 12pm which was awesome and the girl at the front desk was so nice. Not only did she upgrade us to a volcano view room but she waved our resort fee so we ended up paying zero for the room stay. The room was very nice and comfortable. We were not kept up by outside noise other than our friend who snored like a buzz saw (next time they are getting their own room). Anyway, we decided to go for a swim in the pool afterchecking in. The water is icy cold but you get used to it quickly (thanks to the scorching hot weather.) It is a beautiful pool and there were plenty of empty lounge chairs to lay down on or place your items on while you take a dip in the pool. We also ate at the buffet (delicious) and saw Love (amazing). We only stayed one night though which made me very sad. Next summer we will stay here again and use our Vegas points for 4 nights instead of one. I seriously can't wait to go back. Get a Volcano view room and have fun. You won't be disappointed.
First, I'd like to review the bad things about this hotel while they're fresh in my mind, and why I took off a star from this review. In short: Broken air conditioner went unfixed even though they sent up a facilities guy twice, but they moved us to a new room. In-room internet access is so slow it's useless, even though you're paying for it in your daily Resort Fee. Everything else was fantastic and The Mirage exceeded my expectations considering it's an older Strip resort. Now, to the details:. . I tried the $20 donation trick at 11AM with the very pleasant lady checking us in and even though the bill was politely returned, she gave us a "Strip view upgrade", but the room wasn't ready yet. We were texted a couple hours later with our room number. Happily we went up to the 14th floor and got settled in our room. Only after returning a few hours later did we realize our air conditioner was broken - it was blowing air, just not cold air. Seeing as it's the end of August and it's 108 outside, our room quickly heated up to about 76 degrees. The thermostat was broken and we couldn't change the set point. We called the front desk, they said they'd send a guy up, and we went out to dinner. When we returned, the room was still too warm, but the thermostat was fixed. . . We figured we'd let it settle for the night and maybe in the morning the room would be nice and cool. Changing the thermo to 66 did not make the actual air conditioner blow cold air. We both slept like crap as the room temp increased to probably 84 degrees during the night. In the morning, we called down and they offered to send another maintenance guy "up right away" to fix things, and put a room on hold in case it couldn't be fixed. We went out for a few hours, returned, the room was still hot (and the guy hadn't come yet), so we called down to the desk and they switched us to a new room right away. We were sweating like crazy as we re-packed our bags (it had to be at least 88 in our room by then), and fortunately our existing keys worked fine in the new room down the hallway. So, not so good about the unfixable air conditioner and the crappy night sleep, but great about how they moved us right away as soon as we said we had enough.. . Both wired and wireless internet access in our 2 rooms on the 14th floor was a complete, horrible failure. If I was staying at the Mirage for business I simply wouldn't be able to work at all in my room as there was absolutely no way to maintain anything near a usable internet connection, wired or wireless, using my phone, my tablet, or my laptop. I spent a very aggravating hour in my room trying to download a few PDF menus for various Vegas restaurants and I could never get higher than 75kb/s. Often it was more like 40kb/s. Considering your "free internet access" is part of your $30/day resort fee, it's completely unusable.. . Both of our rooms were very nice. Wide open floorplan, with a desk-like writing console attached to one wall. Marble entry way that gave way to carpet - it looked very nice. No extra walls blocking sight lines. It was one big room, very well decorated in a modernish art theme, with a 36" flatscreen TV, alarm with iPod dock, two phones, mini-bar fridge that you couldn't store your own stuff in. Plenty of lights, and the windows actually opened up a little bit so you could let in fresh air. Bathroom was fine, normal sized tub/shower, all the fixtures looked high end and modern, and again exceeded expectations.. . The casino was decent. Not as wide open or as vast as say The Venetian but a good size and without an oppressive, smoky feel to it. A wide variety of machines and table games, including video Craps and video Roulette. Drink service while playing was excellent. I wasn't seated anywhere for more than a few minutes before a waitress came around. At the lounges, a 32oz draft beer and a Cosmo was $28, which I found to be about average on the Strip.. . The MLife card is accepted here but the card rewards are a joke, unless you plan on gambling $10k or more during your stay. We gambled quite a bit at the MLife / MGM properties over the 4 days and I didn't even come close to earning a free T-shirt let alone a dinner or a show ticket.  . . Carnegie Deli was great, Starbucks was slower than at home. They do serve unlimited beer (including a good IPA) and wine and champagne in the buffet, so you could probably get pretty wasted in a cost effective manner.. . Checkout was fast and courteous, and they had ample people at the desk plus a parade of other guys checking you in the line to make sure you didn't want to use their Express Checkout. Bell desk was great, doormen were great, everything was much better than I anticipated. Every single Mirage employee I dealt with exceeded my expectations with their courtesy and demeanor. If the price remains comparable to other Strip resorts, I will definitely go back to the Mirage on our next stay.
Love Mirage!!! I came here with my daughter last month. Love everything about it. The room and decor. They were accomodating because I needed a room close to elevator since my daughter had a knee issue and was limiting her walking. I know sounds crazy since we are in Vegas and lots of walking. But, that's when we turned to the Deuce:) Anyways,  I wanted a Strip view and the view we got wasn't the greatest. But, it's ok. I think we were on the 11th floor so next time I'll ask for a higher floor. Loved the waterfalls in the pools, the erupting Volcano.We only went to Starbucks & the Blizz Yogurt which has froyo & crepes. The other restaurants line were too long & kinda pricey.  The checkout process was super easy . I just called them from the room & checked out!!! So fast. You can also do it thru the TV, a kiosk in the lobby, or stand in the long line. Location is really good. You got Venetian across. Treasure Island on the left , Ceasar's on the right. McDonalds, Panda Express, & Chipotle across. Deuce bus stop is right in front of the hotel. Mirage has a free tram to Treasure Island as well. I also got a $50 poolside credit. Pina Colada's were good & Miami Vice which is a combo of Pina Colada & Strawberry Daiquiri. You just give tip which is still getting drinks for free. The Secret Dolphin Habitat(can't remember exact name). . They have dolphins & the big cats. I think this should be free to guests. Show your keycard to cashier to get $8off discount  I forgot regular price. If you go on the website, this discount isn't mentioned.  They don't even tell you when you check in. I just asked & glad I did. We saw dolphins, lions, panther, & tigers. They also had baby cats that day which were so cute. You get a wristband so if you want to return that day. We didn't because I wasn't that impressed & it was 108oF that day. Oh, before you go in, there's a section where you take pics. They give you a ticket & it's basically the pics uploaded in their computer and if you want you can buy. There's a gift shop and there is where you buy the pics. I wasn't going to but the backgrounds were so cute that I got suckered in. Pics are pricey. I bought the one with the frame and 3 pics. So, overall, Mirage is a very good hotel & kid friendly. Love Vegas:)
