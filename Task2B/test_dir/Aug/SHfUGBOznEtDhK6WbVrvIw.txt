The place is a bit small and there's usually a wait which isn't a terrible thing since the meat is delicious. One of the best places to come if you live here or are visiting from afar. You might be sharing your table with strangers and if they're open to chat it makes the experience much more enjoyable. The pastrami sandwich was delicious and they give a good amount of meat that makes it a bit difficult to eat. The pickle was what won me over, perfectly crunchy and the right salty. :)
Although you're probably going to have to wait a relativity long time, and you're probably going to have to share a table, it is worth it. . The service was super fast, and being from NYC, prices were reasonable at around $8 a sandwich. You get what you pay for!
Oh yeah, enjoyed this.. . Had the standard smoked meat sandwich, fries - and I tried to have a cherry cola too, after my son pointed it out.  He didn't want a cherry cola himself, so I picked on  up.  (There's a point here.  Keep reading.). . Sandwich was great.  Fries were out of this world.  Never got to try the cherry cola and my son stole it.  Yes, I was annoyed.  Next time I'm going to Montreal he's simply not invited.  :-\. . Note:  They have no patience for newbs - watch the people before you to figure out about ordering and what's what.. . Would I recommend:  Yes. Would I return:  Yes.. . Wish we hadn't been in such a rush - would have been nice to have taken some time to walk up and down the street they are on, looked like it might be interesting shopping.  Next time!
I was visiting Montreal over the weekend and was told that I needed to try this place. It was a great recommendation and I fully agree with that advice. If you're going to Montreal you should definitely make time to eat at Schwartz's.. . I will warn you that the line was very long, however, it was worth the wait!. . No need to look at the menu here you NEED to get the Smoked Meat. Their special is the smoked meat sandwich, fries and a cherry cola. I switched the cola to normal coke with my order and was in heaven.. . Giving Schwartz's a 5 star rating is a no brainer. This place is awesome!
I'm generally pretty easy going when it comes to poor service but Schwart's restaurant takes the cake.  . . This happened on August 2, 2014 at around 9:30pm. I confirmed with the take-out side that the restaurant side will sell pre-packaged packages of their meat, and that if they run out, they'll run over to the take out side and grab it.  So then i returned later that night to the restaurant side, the guy behind the counter asked what he could get me, and i asked if he had any packages of the frozen meat, and he says in a nasty tone that they don't freeze their meats, so fine, what about the vacuum sealed packages?  He slaps one down on the counter, so I said, do you have any more?  He said, no, that's it.  I said, the take-out side said that if you run out you can just go over to the take-out side, he replies, "There's no more until 9am the next day!  Where are you from?"  I replied, "Ottawa".  He said, "You don't need vacuum sealed packages driving to Ottawa, maybe if you were flying to China!"  Ok....I'm from Ottawa, why on EARTH would I fly to China??  Just because I look Chinese he thinks I'm going to China???  . THEN, I'm trying to do the mental math in my head to figure out how many lbs of meat I want, and i unconsciously say, "ummmmm"...he then has the nerve to MOCK me by saying "ummmmm" back to me.. So i put through my order and go to pay at the cashier, who also wasn't very nice, probably because i interrupted her flirting with a waiter, but as I'm paying, I hear my husband picking up the meat that I ordered and thanking the guy (EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T DESERVE IT) and he has the nerve to say, "Everybody knows how to say thank you, but nobody reaches into their pockets do they?". He was RACIST, RUDE, CONDESCENDING, AND TO TOP IT ALL HE'S ASKING TO BE TIPPED???. So we leave rolling our eyes and then him and the other guy behind the counter start jeering at us!. . NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN.
great NY deli. Get the corned beef.. yummm
I find that this is number the one recommended place to go when visiting Montreal. On a hot summer day, a 30 minute wait in a line might seem a little long but it was worth it. Even the crammed, cafeteria style seating did not manage to ruin this experience for me. I was told to get pickles and a large plate of smoked meat (they bring bread anyways). It was so delicious! I don't drink Coke but this meal required the classic Cherry Coke so I obliged. Service was fast and when we asked for another pickle it was delivered at a lightening speed. This is a MUST and I already want to go back!
I was lucky enough to get a great parking spot right in front of Schwartz's on St Laurent.  I had to remind myself how Montreal parking works... it's been a while since I've driven in the city.  You have to know your parking spot assigned number so you can enter it into the parking machine on the street.  You don't need to put the ticket on your dash, you just need to make sure you're entering the right spot assigned number in to the machine.. . I didn't see any lines so this was good... it was about 4:45pm.  Walking into the place it was still packed.  There was a single stool at the bar so I ended up taking that spot which worked out since I was by myself.. . The choice was simple... smoked meat sandwich!!!  If I didn't get the fries I probably could have eaten 2 sandwiches.  I did get the fries which are basically fries but they are good.  The black cherry Cott soda was a good compliment.  I'm trying to drink less pop these days but really it was a must to complete the trinity.  . . This sandwich is spot on and this is one of the reasons why Montreal will always have one up on TO when it comes to food... IMO this one food item is one of the cornerstones of Montreal's food extravaganza.  If it's not their version of bagels, or pizza or steamies it's their smoked meat and this place serves the best I've had.  . . I went to Katz in NYC but didn't get end up eating there.  We walked in and walked out pretty fast.  Why?  It felt like I was lining up for get on a Disney ride before the reservation system.  Thanks but no thanks... it was a long walk that day in the summer in lower Manhattan and although I can't compare what Schwartz's has compared to Katz's I probably won't ever have to.  Schwartz's was no nonsense, quick, no line up and I didn't have to feel like I needed a wristband to get into a club that had bottle service.. . Schwartz's again = the best I've had in my life for Montreal smoke meat.  Carnegie Deli on 7th Ave in NYC so far is the best corned beef and pastrami I've had.  . . Schwartz's prices also are not outrageous either.  Considering they serve a lot of sandwiches both eat in and take out their consistency of their quality has really no choice but to be what they are in order to garner the attention they deserve.  . . I will have to now make this restaurant a must go place every time I go to Montreal now... I think I may go there again on the way out of town too!
Crazy, crowded little deli in Montreal were we waited in line for our smoked meat sandwiches. I mean, I didn't even know what I was ordering, I just knew that's what everyone was there for so I decided that's what I was there for too. . . The staff was brusque, fast, and competent in their jobs in whatever language anyone spoke to them. Being a tourist it was a bit intimidating but by the time I reached the front of the line I had rehearsed my order enough times to avoid annoying the guy behind the counter.. . I also picked up a mustard, because when you have extra foreign money, you spend it, the end. It looks like just a normal, yellow mustard, but it makes my sandwiches kick back like nothing else. 5 stars for the mustard!. . We got 2 smoked meat sandwiches and a small bag of greasy fries. The fries were, as I said, greasy, and not salted enough, and we left the overcrowded counter to eat outside in the nice weather, leaving the ketchup bottles behind in the process. TL;DR the fries were not impressive.. . But I was not there for the fries. I was there for the sandwiches. The smoked meat sandwiches. The smoked meat sandwiches that apparently inspired a Canada-wide musical of Schwartz's, evidence of which we saw while waiting in line. . . We sat on a bench and when I unwrapped the sandwich I had to swallow immediately or I would have drooled. The smell was so tantalizing and meaty. I applied mustard and took an enormous bite. The flavors of the meat. The mustard. The flimsy bread failingly trying to hold back the greatness of the meat.  I ate it good and dirty. Messy and unapologetic. A blacklight would have shown my entire face covered with that sandwich. Except you wouldn't need a blacklight to see it. . . 10/10 would gorge here again.
There's always a line at this place and it came highly recommended by locals, so I had to give it a try. Ordered the signature smoked meat sandwich and was underwhelmed. It's okay, but nothing screams at you making you want to return.
well, one thing that u must try, at least once, at Montreal. smoked meat tastes great. always long line outside.
After leaving Montreal for a year, one of the first things I did was go to Schwartz. You really appreciate their smoked meat, when you have had to do without it. Nothing comes to close their quality.
The line was way too long to wait, but I got a delicious smoked meat sandwich to go.   Amazing.  It was like a cross between  pastrami and corned beef.  And the beef sticks were great.
Truly awesome smoked meat sandwiches. Rye, mustard and meat. Simple and delicious. Highly recommended if you're in the area. Try to go during the week and off peak hours to avoid the lines. The line here can get pretty long. If you don't want to wait, head across the street to Main Deli. You won't be disappointed.
Well worth the wait! Try to go early if you can because they get really busy! Smoked meat sandwich is amazing! So amazing that once you try it you'll never be the same...yes it's that great!
I only went to the takeaway part of the store so I can't speak for the restaurant side. But the service was quick and easy, the smoked beef was to die for! Everyone should at least try it once and your want to go back for more!
It's been a few weeks since our visit to Schwartz's and I still salivate thinking about this sandwich! When we got there, the line for sit-down service was easily 40-50 people deep, so we went to the take-out line instead. Still a long line that weaved up and down the length of the store, but in reality, we only waited 20-30 minutes?. . We got the medium fat smoked meat sandwich and it was perfect- not too fatty, not too dry. The mustard in the sandwich gives it the perfect balance. We also got an order of poutine (no meat). It was good, but definitely not as spectacular as the sandwiches. The cheese curds were super fresh and squeaky, but perhaps a little too heavy for just 2 people with a sandwich each. If you decide to get take-out, there's a little park 2 blocks away where we ate our food and it was perfect.
Ok, it was great. Smoked meat, pickle and cherry cola. Worth the line, and the calories!
All I can say is... Just do it! This MTL staple is worth the hype for all foodies. Wait in line for as long asnecessary to try that smoked meat. So worth the wait. Thankfully our wait was only a short 10 min at 9:00pm on a Monday night. Don't order anything else but the #3. Juicy, flavorful, especially if you have a small piece of fat in there. We also had a juicy pickle on the side. I don't know what else to say, but it was AMAZING. I regret not buying one "to-go" for later. . . They had a cherry soda which one of the workers recommended, but tasted like Dimetap, not a fan. Stop by an ATM first, cash only.
Its a good jewish deli. They looked at me and my wife kinda funny and surprised, we are muslim, so i can understand their surprise. . . We ordered the lean smoked meat, it was really good. I recommend to go medium fat as its probably juicer and not as dry. The sandwich came out hot and tasty. Other than the asian group of guys chomping with their mouths wide open like a heard of carnivores cattle i recommend trying this place at least once. Not bad for a $9 sandwich.
The best sandwiches.  Love the medium fat smoked meat on rye, delicious!  My sister lives in Montreal and brings me a sandwich when she flies home, unbeatable!
We waited about 10 minutes for lunch. As soon as we got inside, the service was very fast. The meat was scrumptious. We ordered a large plate that came with bread and shared it between us two. The fries were very good. Cherry cola is a must! . . Schwartz's is a quintessential Montreal experience!
Been coming to Montreal since the late 90's and never had a smoked meat sandwich. Well when the hubbs wanted to come up to watch our Mets take in the Blue Jays at Stade Olympique I made it a point to come here for dinner. . I do have to say Jewish Deli is my #1 favorite type of food. The reason for this has to come from my Grandmothers next door neighbor who IMHO made the best sour dill pickles EVER!!!!  But I digress, but will get to their pickles in a bit. . Let me start off with the place. We get there and it is tiny with maybe 8 tables I could see that were chocked full of people. Also facing the food was a bar that had stools you could sit at. When we got there (9 on a Saturday night) the only two places to sit were at the bar which were fine by us.. Now as I have said before I love Deli food so when it comes to the meat I am a little picky.  I do prefer a more fatty cut of meat and they deliver. You have your choice of three levels of fattiness which is a nice option as not everyone enjoys the fatty part of brisket. . The fries are amazing as they are whole potatoes that look like they are cut in house. An order is large enough to split although I tried valiantly to not hog them all but failed miserably. . Ok now the star of the meal for me was the pickles. They were so good that I let the husband have the rest of the fries so that I could have his pickle. Putter is the brand name of them and I really wish that they had them on this side of the border.
