The Fountains at the Bellagio are one of the iconic images of Las Vegas.  . . The show is every half hour or so starting in the evening and go through the late night hours.  The fountain show is truly impressive shooting jets of water hundreds of feet into the air.  Each show is accompanied by music.  There is not a bad spot to view the show from but ideally you would want to be on Las Vegas Blvd.  The Bellagio is on the west side and serves as the back drop to the show.
The Fountains of Bellagio is a must must must must must do!  If I had only one night to spend in Vegas, I would literally spend it watching the fountains.  There are some things that are just so wonderful, they can't be described with words, and the Fountains of Bellagio is the granddaddy of these things!  It's funny, then, that I'm trying to write a review comprised of only words to describe it.  So how should I do it justice?  I'm hoping that the phrase "less is more" rings true for this review and will thus keep it simple.. Absolutely breathtaking.. Unimaginably romantic.. Amazingly mesmerizing.. Actually wait, I know how to describe it.... Just. Perfect.
The Fountains are something i always look forward to seeing when coming to Vegas, I love water shows and this one is just spectacular. It is simply breathtaking at night and draws quite a large crowd so you kind of have to make sure you are there at the right time so you can get a good viewing spot and are able to take pictures.

A must see!
Sure, the fountain show can get a tad old when you've seen it 175032 times. But it's still totally neat and an absolute Vegas must-do. It's awesome night and day. It's awesome from the ground, from a restaurant, from a hotel room, and from a car. And the songs / water choreography rotates, so it's likely you'll see something different most every time you watch it.. . During peak tourist times of the year, if you plan on viewing from the sidewalk, it's good to arrive early so you can get a spot where you can see. Special tip: Viewing it from the top of Eiffel Tower is pretty cool. And many hotel rooms in the surrounding properties offer a good view of the fountains. (This was one of the highlights of my room experience at Bally's.) You can also sit outside on the patio at some of the Bellagio restaurants and get a great and different view of the fountains.. . Personally, for me, my fav viewing is from my car, whilst driving by. I turn off the radio, roll down the windows, and enjoy my time stopped at a red light.
Several moments of peace and clarity have swept me off my feet in front of the fountains of Bellagio. I have been encouraged by friends to make decisions that have changed the trajectory of my life for the better while waiting for the show to begin. Something about the lights and the water create such an existential experience! All in all, I may seem biased, but this is hands down the best free street attraction in Las Vegas. . . Highly recommend checking it out at night to fully experience the ambience of the fountains in front of the Bellagio. Worth it to find the midway point to see the fountains in all its glory. . . Shows every 15 mins after 7pm until midnight. Shows every 30 minutes from 12pm to 7pm. The speakers also announce when the next showing will be. Stick around for two showings to see the variety that the show offers. There is some awesome music playing on the speakers and plenty of people watching opportunities to keep you entertained while waiting for the next show. If you're not into embarking on a spiritual experience, this is also a great opportunity to pretend that you were a part of Ocean's 11.
