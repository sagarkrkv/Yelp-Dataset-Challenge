Awesome restaurant. The pork and sweet potatoes were amazing. The flavored were superb. The service was great with lots of knowledge about the food. I will come back and bring family and friends.
Some friends came to Vegas and wanted to go to Mesa.  It was kind of last minute, and since it was Saturday night, I figured I better call and make a reservation.  They put us down for 6:00.  Of course, the traffic was horrible, so I called back and asked if we could change our reservation.  They informed me that since I didn't secure our reservation with a credit card that we, in fact, didn't have one.  The person I spoke with on the phone was not helpful and very rude. She proceeded to argue with me about whether or not I had a reservation till finally I asked if I could just, please, make one.  I made the new reservation for 6:30 and she let me off the phone without a credit card.  Then when we arrived at the restaurant the Hostess, rudely, told me that we didn't have a reservation, she was adamant about this, till I pointed at my name, written down on her sheet next to "6:30".. . I had a beer (corona or tecate?), the Lobster Tacos (appetizer), and the sesame crusted ahi.  It was alright.  The portions were very small.  My daughter had a cheese quesadilla and milk.  The bill for just myself and my daughter came out to $100.. . The service was good but there wasn't a lot to it.
I will admit I am a foodie fan, and I am all about celebrity chefs. I mean I was watching food shows before they were cool. I did no research about Mesa Grill before hand, so Dan and I literally stumbled on this place in a hunger stoop-per, I was about to pass out from hunger.. . We passed many eateries in Ceasers Palace, but when I looked at the menu, prices I said lets try it. I was glad to be immediately greeted and seated, so was Dan. We were starving! The waiter was educated and it was through him I found out I was in Bobby's place!!. . Burgers here are just aboslutley amazing. I really will say they have the best in the world. I mean it too. There are a lot of great awesome burgers, but Mesa is literally the best. I want one right now.
First of I do know Bobby Flay does not chef/cook here. However, I had the pleasure of eating here recently and have to say it was excellent from finish to start. We came for weekend brunch and found the service, food quality and ambiance to be great. The appetizer of Tuna Nachos consisted of really good quality fish and was robust in flavor. The bread basket ( complimentary) was amazing from scones to cornbread. Have never been to a restaurant with such an amazing bread basket. Add to that the final courses of Ancho Salmon & Scrambled eggs with biscuits and the restaurant hit a home run. Margaritas were also tasty and unique ( pear cactus marg?! Wow!)....lastly service was great with staff who followed up consistently and were friendly. Highly recommend for anyone coming to Vegas!
I always enjoy coming to the Mesa grill, and have been here many times over the years. It is pricey, but the food and service is always consistently excellent.. . Today I enjoyed the rough cut tuna nachos, which is really better classified as a southwest inspired tuna tar tar with chips on the side. I also had a delicious black bean tamale with basil butter that was simple perfection, and a classic example of what makes Mesa great.
Holy guacamole! We have considered this place so many times, in the past, but never ended up making it. This trip we made it a priority to stop and and I'm so glad we did. . . Mesa grill is located right in front of the coliseum (convenient if you are going to a show here) and easy to find. . . The menu is full if yummy delights that are not readily found other places. The flavors are unique and really delight your palate. They start you off with a bread basket that has a variety of breads including jalapeno cornbread which was our fav. We started off with the queso fundido which is unlike any we've ever had in the past. Tasty!  I had the chile rubbed ribeye while my husband had the pork tenderloin. Four thumbs up! The finale was the banana pie which was a miss but it wasn't bad - just wasn't as good as the rest. . . The service was TOP notch - I cannot even think if a recent time that we've had that good of service. Our every need was anticipated - refills kept coming, silverware was always quickly changed out between courses, and the timing of the courses was superb. . . I cannot say enough good about Mesa Grill - I will sing it's praise to whoever will listen. I cannot wait to get back to Las Vegas just to eat here!
My boyfriend and I tried this place out for lunch on 8/5.. . I ordered the BBQ lamb cobb salad ($18). BBQ'ed lamb, avocado, tomato, boiled egg, applewood bacon, bleu cheese, & buttermilk dressing.  It was pretty good.  If you don't like overpowering bleu cheese, get it without.. . My boyfriend ordered the green chile burger ($18).  Queso sauce,poblanos, red onions, and fries.  He loved it! I'm not a huge spicy fan, so I didn't try it.  But the fries were delicious!. . Server was nice, but very robotic.  The server assistants were great! Our water glasses were never less than half full.
I went to the Mesa Grill this last weekend in Las Vegas because my family really, really want to try Bobby Flay's restaurant.  I was not very impressed.  . . I will say the food is excellent so if you are going ONLY for the food then you are the right spot. The Queso Fundido and the Tuna Nachos were excellent. The steak was flavorful but not to die for.  The service was ok, not great.   . . My biggest disappointment was the lack of choices for wine by the glass.   Any of the good choices were by the bottle and extremely for overpriced for the labels they offered. If you are the only wine drinker in the group it sucks.  It seemed a shame not to have a really good glass of wine to compliment the dishes. . . Lastly if you still want to go after reading this then be sure to make your reservation about a week before you get there or expect to eat really, really late.
Absolutely incredible food.  The seared tuna with couscous was seasoned very well and tasted so so good.  The side dish of corn is a MUST try.  You haven't had corn until you've tried this and it's just corn lol for dessert my mom and I split this chocolate cake with salted rice crispies on the top and a caramel sauce pooled on the bottom.  Let me tell you I have no idea what they put in this cake to make it taste so incredibly decadent but this is HANDS DOWN the BEST chocolate cake I've ever eaten in my life.  Who knew rice crispies could pair so perfectly with chocolate cake.  If your thinking "oh it's just another chocolate cake" it's NOT!! Everyone needs this cake in their lives, ok I'm done. Lol
Outside of dining at Bellagio's Prime, this was the best restaurant we ate at during our Vegas vacation. (Prime gets the edge because of the spectacular al fresco dining overlooking the fountain).. . The food is expertly prepared and presented with southwest flavors and textures that are pleasing to the senses. The pork tenderloin in particular was fantastic. The sides of corn and mashed potatoes were mouth watering.
I was so disappointed in the food. However, the service was excellent. I don't mind spending money on good food but bad food, no way. I order the lamb chops they were lacking in a real basic salt and pepper. and under cooked. I ordered medium but they were rare.  Also, with this meal came with a tamale it was not edible, I would think a  chef of this caliber would have a restaurant that showed his expertise. I cook a lot and I would not have put out dinner like this. Also, at our table we ordered the halibut it just was boring. Don't make the same mistake that I did. Do "NOT" go to this restaurant. I am convinced that good food is not on the strip. Stay off the strip if you are a foodie like me.
This place is overhyped & I doubt there is any oversight by Bobby. The free bread & queso fundito were great. The chille relleno was in super sweet red pepper sauce. Cloyingly sweet. Boyfriend's shrimp tacos were way too spicy & the sauces served with were way too sweet. Really wanted to love this place because I love Bobby's recipes, but it fell flat. If you just get a couple drinks (maybe not the peach margarita, which was my fault for ordering when everything else was too sweet), get the free bread & appetizers. I would go back for just that, but not for the "real" food... Sorry Bobby!
great service - and the food is really good. the bread basket is too good if you know what i mean. His signature shrimp app is phenomenal. I had his signature new Mexican pork tenderloin and really liked it. My friend had the Bone in Rib Eye and though he thought it was a tad under-cooked for his taste, my couple of bites were amazing. I took the waiter's suggestion and ordered the margarita Cadillac style, too sweet for me. I prefer triple sec. But now i know how I like my margarita's so all is not lost. Nice glass of red wine with dinner and since we had to rush off took our cookies to go. . Definitely will go again.
Brunch review*** love the brunch here. Great southwest flavours, chill staff. Never dissapointed when I come here...a bit out of the oridinary and well worth it
Went here with my fiancee for dinner and it was great! The bread basket was delish...our favorite was the cornbread. I had the salmon...which was tasty and not fishy at all. He had the NY strip steak and he was impressed with the portion...he could not finish it--but certainly tried...he said it wasn't as tender as he expected. The winner was the side order of the Roasted Corn.  We skipped dessert since our appetites were satisfied.  The restaurant is loud...we were seated between two groups of four people and close to the kitchen where they were yelling out orders. This restaurant is good for groups, not for romantic dinners.
mexican food. Burger and sandwich are good.
Went here last night with the BF because we are huge Bobby Flay fans as heard from family that this place was good.  Our experience unfolded with mixed feelings.... . FOOD:. I ordered from the special restaurant week menu they had going on, three courses for just over 50 bucks which is a great deal.  The salad I chose for course  number one was top notch!  Not too hefty on the lettuce, crunchy white and blue corn chip pieces, perfect amount and type of cheese, and great dressing.  Then I had the ever-raved-about pork tenderloin.  Perfectly cooked, good balance of flavor, but insanely spicy.  I'm a southern gal, I like spice, but wow...  This one should have a warning on it. The tamale that comes with does an ok job of balancing the heat, and is absolutely delicious by itself, but I was glad I had plenty of water and a yummy white peach margarita to wash it all down.Third course was a chocolate pudding with salted caramel something or other.  It was tasty; I also could have easily made it at home.  . BF had the rib eye.  It looked good.  Flavor was great.  Unfortunately, the cook was way off.  He asked for mid rare, and got super duper rare.  It bordered on undercooked.  BF got a side of corn which, I didn't care for but, he loved which is surprising because he hates cheese.. . So... Mixed thoughts on food. . SERVICE/AMBIANCE:. Amazing!!  Perfect balance of casual atmosphere and fine dining.  The entire front of house staff is spectacular.  Kind, professional, caring, and timely without being stuffy or overly doting.  We tipped big because we found everyone deserving - from the hostess to our waiter to the guy with the water.. . . . So all in all, a pretty fine choice.
We had a really delicious meal at Mesa Grill while celebrating a couple of family birthdays in Las Vegas.  We were excited because we love Bobby Flay on TV (and he was super nice when we met him in person).  We ordered the Queso Fundito (yummy, cheesy dip) and a shrimp tamale (excellent).  For main dishes, we ordered a variety of things, so we were able to taste a bunch of stuff! Steak, Lamb, Tuna, Lobster.... all super delicious and expertly seasoned.  . The service was good... everyone was polite, patient (with our big group) and attentive.  I would definitely go back again, but there are so many different Bobby Flay restaurants, it may be a while... Can't wait for the next one!
I came here after several nights of over extending myself with typical Vegas debauchery -  literally having had only two hours of sleep and maintaining a consistent level of alcohol in my system over the previous 48 hours. In other words, exhausted and ready to pass out (exactly how you should feel on the final morning before you fly out of Las Vegas). . . I ordered the Sweet Potato hash, which resembles an egg benedict with a side of the mango glazed bacon and the creamy grits. The bacon was thick and cooked perfectly, but in the end bacon is bacon and there wasn't much reason for this bacon to cost what it does. But the grits were subtler in their spice level (I loved it). The spicy chicken eggs hash was the star of the show - spicy, sweet, and savory depending on the bite. I ate it as slowly as I could - heaven. . . Lovely upscale decor with almost every table having a view of the "kitchen show" is a nice touch. But the tables are positioned too densely and strangely despite the restaurant being nearly empty another group was sat directly beside us. . . It goes without saying that you are going to be paying quite a bit for the experience, but that's Vegas!
This is a very solid restaurant.  It located in Caesar's.  We ordered the Tiger Prawn Tamale and Duck Blue Corn Pancake for apps.. . The Tiger Prawn Tamale was so delicious.  The tamale was silky and creamy.  The flavor was magnificent.  . . Next the duck was cooked perfectly.  It was tender and the star anise sauce complimented the duck well.  The habenero sauce added extra heat.. . The New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin was really great.  The pork was cooked to a perfect pink medium and also was juicy.  The ancho chile sauce worked well with the pork.. . The Chile Relleno was really good.  The crusty exterior was cooked perfectly.  But the inside was moist and has tons of flavor.. . Finally the Chipotle Glazed Rib-eye was a little underwhelming.  While it was cooked perfectly, the chipotle glaze didn't enhance the meat.  If anything, I think it disguised or masked the nice beef flavor.  I think it would have been better just with salt and pepper.. . Anyway, very solid restaurant.
Amazing service. Great food. The flavors were fantastic.
