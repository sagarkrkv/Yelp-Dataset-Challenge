Wow where do I begin.  I guess this is top dog for Phoenix but in the realm of pizza in general it rates up there with a strip mall no name pizza joint.  I am going to start with the dessert menu.  Really - every dessert is served with Nutella?  There wasn't one faux authentic Italian dessert on the menu.  Coffee - regular coffee that was exactly like the coffee I had in a hospital cafeteria.  I asked if they had cream for the coffee and I was told "Yes, we have half/half."  It was liquid Coffee Mate? Uh, that is not half/half.  While I wait let me give you "our cold stale bread" served without anything not even butter.  We had the Latina pizza and the tomato on the pizza was not even ripe nor near the color red and it was cold dropped on the pizza like a wet noodle.  I bit into a piece of rosemary and felt like I was immersed in a Vicks Vaporub mozzarella pizza.  If this place is owned by a native Italian he/she would be the laughing stock of his former Italian neighborhood.  . . Hang on... I didn't taste any of the wine.  You might be redeemed with a decent selection of Chianti but I can't imagine this is possible.  . . Wait wait wait.... the actual restaurant is very quaint in appearance.
I ordered the Genova pizza.  Straight up, it tasted like grass.  The onions and potatoes were still raw and I couldn't taste the basil pesto.  It tasted like grass.  The entire meal I was wishing I just ordered a margherita pizza.  My husband had a safe sausage pizza.  I ended up eating part of his pizza because I couldn't stand mine.  . . Still I can understand the charm of this place.  It's tucked away downtown and has a homey feel to it.  . . I don't know if I wanna give them another chance.  Maybe, but not anytime soon.
Really great food and atmosphere.  Valet parking is easy and convenient. Great wine list. One of my favorite places to go! Update for December 2014 - dinner was great, place was packed. Six of us dining and requested two bills. A tip was added onto both bills, but it was not easy to see that it was added...two of us looked for it before adding a tip and neither of us saw that it was added. Of course the server did NOT have the courtesy to tell us. We added 20% and she still didn't say a thing, resulting in an almost 40% tip!! I tip very well if the service is good, but I'm very disappointed that a server wouldn't point out that it is included in the bill already. We had to find her and request a partial refund of our double tip, which was embarrassing. She knew exactly what she was doing. Management be aware of your employees pulling this on customers.
My daughter, grandson and I visited this quaint little restaurant last evening and were very impressed with the pizza and salad.  I would highly recommend trying Cibo.
Another place to go for thin crust pizza in Phoenix. The place looks real cool and bright.. . Don't miss the desserts also.
amazing perfect for lunch or date night.
My girlfriend Lisette had been harping on me for weeks to try this place, and she finally convinced me to leave the house and meet her at Cibo. When I pulled up to the restaurant to my pleasant surprise it was a quaint building reminding me of a house in Washington.. The food was delicious, and the service was quick and friendly. Although there was a larger party seated next to us, it did not distract from the over all experience. I was very pleased, and look forward to returning again!
Finally, I got to try the pizza that everyone has been raving about!  . . Being a pizza snob, I take my pizza seriously!. . I had been to Cibo long ago but was discouraged by the fact that this place, which labels itself as a "pizzeria" did not serve any pizza during lunch.  A fact that was never mentioned over the years by all the rave reviews, in advertisements, or even on their own website.  I'm sure many others experienced the disappointment of finding this out on their first visit.  . . The news that they had recently started to serve pizza options for lunch prompted me to finally return.  Though I should note that (at this point) your pizza choices are limited to only four selections, nothing like the nearly two dozen options available at dinner.. . Cibo's pizza harkens back to the traditional pizza from Napoli, however it falls short of accomplishing this feat, and for those who have experienced "authentic" pizza, this comes across as a failed attempt.  However, it is definitely a step up from average pizza place.. . I ordered the Salsiccia Pizza, which has tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and sausage. The crust is made from "00" flour, cooked in a fired oven and is soft and appealing, however it fails at the trademark chewiness, and is lacking any type of character development.  In other words...bland.. . I was very happy with the fresh mozzarella and more so with the real fennel sausage, however the tomatoes lacked any brightness, and were lost under the other, more aggressive flavors.. . My pizza was barely seven inches, and was cut in eight pieces, which made the slices too narrow to handle the toppings, so attempting to eat this by hand resulted in more toppings returning to the plate, than were entering my mouth.. . Cibo resides in a rehabilitated home on 5th Avenue, which is small, but inviting.  They have a small lot, and on street parking is shared with other businesses and residences, so parking can be an issue.. . Overall the pizza is decent, however, why would I bother to return here when I can get much better (and larger) pizza at either of the two "Certified" authentic pizzerias that are just blocks away?
Our favorite pizza in AZ. There are many wood fired pizza places but there is something about Cibo that makes them our favorite. The crust is fired to a crisp yet just chewy enough texture. The cheeses and sauces are so fresh and delicious. On this trip we enjoyed the Caprese salad, sausage pizza and calzone that was filled with salami, prosciutto, ricotta, mozzarella and sauce. We have had Bianco and Cibo and we enjoy Cibo just a little more.
Matt was the best server! He was so kind, polite, and informative to our party. We had a dog with us who he was also especially sweet to.. . Food was solid. However the Capri salad could have used more tomatoes, mozerella, and salt in the pesto.
Excellent homemade pasta and relaxing atmosphere.  So glad I live downtown so I can walk here and get my fix :)
This is hands down, one of my favorite spots for date night! The ambience is romantic with hanging lights, as well as the European feel of the restaurant. We ordered the antipasto, a perfect combination of meats, cheese, tomatoes, olives, etc. We then decided to get the Siena pizza, with prosciutto and zucchini. It was my boyfriend's birthday and our server was lovely enough to whip up a free Nutella crepe, with a lit candle. All in all, perfect place for date night!
My friends love this place but I just thought it was okay.  It really depends on the style of pizza you like.  I don't like pizza that is really more bread based than sauce based.  The sauce makes or breaks a pizza for me.  The pizza here doesn't use a lot of sauce or cheese.  If you are a fan of good crust you may love this place but it is not my cup of tea.  I am spoiled since I am from Chicago where there are great pizza places everywhere.  Phoenix has a lot of places people tell me the are really good but I find most of them to be average at best.  It is hard to compare Lou Malnattis or Giordano's in Chicago to anything here.
One of the best patios in Downtown Phoenix. Love the atmosphere!. . The salads and pizza are all amazing! It's my go to spot for lunch or a nice dinner. Romantic yet casual, this is one of my favorite spots!
loved the food, location, and look of the place...they have the same style of pizza that the pizzeria in Heritage Square does...only your not sitting on top of strangers.. Wait staff runs Hot and Cold...some nights we had a waitress/waiter that seemed to be having a wonderful time with their guests...other nights the waiter/waitress and the "water re-filler" seem to be very unhappy we were there. Food makes up for it in my book and you just "rasberry" them off until you get your pizza. thats what Tipping is for
Found this gem on yelp after a long drive from tombstone to Sedona. We were exhausted and hungry. The service was great and the food even better! Mangia!
This restaurant is in one of the historic neighborhoods of Phoenix and it is just lovely.   We sat in the back and had a beautiful view of the city and the small garden area surrounding the restaurant.  (There is a small area just to the right of the entrance that has four tables in close proximity with stone floors and, I believe, brick walls.  The sound in that area is overwhelming so I would not sit there.)  I had a white, gluten free pizza, called Procida that was really delicious: mozzarella, prociutto crudo, asian pears, arugula and goat cheese.  My son had gluten free crust with pepperoni and sausage and he loved it and my husband had one of schiacciata sandwiches, maybe romagnaola - it seemed like it had sausage in it but I don't see that on the menu.  Everything was savory, warm, crusty, and really enjoyable to eat.  We had the fresca for desert and it was really like a party on a plate:  artistically folded crepe around ice cream and fruit, covered with multi colored pieces of fruit and whipped cream and also very pleasant to eat.  A really enjoyable dining experience!
Food is great. Staff was unfriendly. Went to pick up a pizza, walked in had 4 staff members sit and talk to each other while I waited for someone to acknowledge me. I say loudly "I am here for a pick up" and I have to get the pizza box myself before someone comes over for me to pay.
