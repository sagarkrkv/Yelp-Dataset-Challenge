With the apparent demise of Hogs Heaven and Top Notch Bbq, there is no controversy about which BBQ is best. Rollin smoke has the tender smoked goods. The sauce is excellent and the menu is innovative and original. Make sure you get corn nuggets, there is nothing like them.
Outstanding Southern style BBQ with great prices for all budgets.  And there are so many choices on the menu to keep you coming back.  Best BBQ in Vegas and maybe the best in the Western US.. . Saturday afternoon the line was 5 deep.  Walk up, order and find your seat.  Food was out in maybe 12 minutes.. . Family run, served by the son and cooked by dad.  Can't do better than that.  Good food and good owners.
What I look for in a good barbecue is moist and tender meat with a strong smoke aroma and a spicy rub. Looking at the good reviews for this place, my group and I decided to come to this place.  The place itself is small so try not to come during the rush for lunch because you won't find a place to sit.  What really did like right off the bat here is that they have a large smoker you can see by the side of the building as you walk in, and you can smell the smoke already! My group ordered a combination platter called The Pit and it came with spare ribs, brisket, sausage and pulled pork.  We also shared the outlaw burger, which eventually stole the show. The sausage had a mild smokey flavor but it was a little dry. Everything else was very moist and tender and had a good smokey flavor.  The pulled pork and brisket were very tender and flavorful and didn't need any sauce.  The ribs were a little tough to eat off the bone I   I thought, and I didn't get any extra spiciness from the rub. And when I tried to kick it up a noth by adding their bbq sauce, It didnt work.  Their bbq sauce is very bland.  It has no spiciness or tang or zing.  Just mildy dressed up tomatoe sauce. The best thing I tasted there was the OUTLAW BURGER.  The baddass big flavor patty, the onion strings, and the tangy mayo were awesome together.  My advice is to come for the Outlaw burge, pulled pork, and the brisket!
Best BBQ I have ever had! Recommended by a cab driver as the best BBQ in Vegas, we figured we'd try it out, and we are so happy we did! Probably the best meal on the whole trip. Ask for the Carolina sauce, the best one in my opinion. Meat is super tender, melts in your mouth, amazing corn bread.
The BBQ was good, but the sides were disappointing.  I had my mind all set on beef ribs, but when I got to the counter to order they were out.  Quick switch to a sandwich and shared some sides with my friends: hush puppies, corn nuggets, beans & corn bread.  . The beans were a strong disappointment, perhaps because that is one of my favorite parts of good old fashioned Kansas City barbecue.  Here the beans were a little too firm for my taste and the sauce was thin and not quite as flavorful as I would have liked.  The hush puppies were decent, the corn bread was moist but more in the style of a cake batter with a very small amount of cornmeal added.  The fried corn nuggets were ok.. My sandwich was good and the meat was tender, though as others have commented I added quite a bit of BBQ sauce to it.. One aspect I didn't care for was the "messiness" in the dining area.  I certainly understand that operating a high volume dining establishment is hard work, especially when the food is messy to eat, but it can be done.  After placing my order and looking for available seating, several of the spots still had used napkins or debris at the tables.  The open spot we chose had plastic utensils on the floor under the seats and the condiment bottles were messy.  I was facing the back station where customers could grab napkins or tea and the white front was covered with scuff marks and such.
I haven't eaten at this establishment. I just watched the staff prepare the food on the travel channel.  No one wears gloves. The RAW MEAT LOAF IS MIXED WITH BARE HANDS!  When "liquids" are added...more bare hands.  Meat cooked more bare hands...oh my.
Absolutely amazing!!  Hands down the best bbq in Vegas and the best I've had outside of Texas.  This is TRUE bbq, you can tell they don't just slather bbq sauce on the meat and call it barbecued. You can taste the smokiness in the meat and it's unbelievably tender. There were 3 of us and we got the all you can eat so we were able to try a bunch of items on the menu:  chicken, brisket, pulled pork, hot links, spare ribs, baby back ribs, beef ribs, mac n cheese, coleslaw, fried okra, banana pudding, berry cobbler, and a root beer float.. . The highlights were definitely the ribs. The spare ribs and baby backs were my FAVORITE things we tried. Spare ribs had a bit more kick and spice, and the baby backs were juicier and fattier (in a delicious, perfect way). The beef rib was also delicious - not to mention the biggest rib I've ever seen - but very rich and filling. The coleslaw was excellent to cut the richness, sweetness, and smokiness of the meal, and the fried okra was simple and perfect. Mac n cheese was also great (I totally judge a bbq place on hthe quality of their mac n cheese... ie Big Ern's at Container Park sucks). Brisket wasn't thrilling, but I admit I like my brisket with a little fat on it and this was quite lean.. . The prices are insanely good, cheaper than Famous Daves or Lucilles, and the food is better! We got AYCE but would've been fine sharing the Pit Special, Rib Platter, & adding a couple beef ribs - which is basically exactly what we ordered, except we paid more because we chose AYCE and they added extra to the platter, which we didn't need and had quite a bit leftover. Also the service is awesome, they genuinely care if you're enjoying the food. The entire experience was great!  I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu, I have my eye on the collard greens, loaded mash potatoes, and "bbq parfait!"
BBQ was ok. I wanted to try some BBQ when i was in Vegas. I checked yelp and came here. I got the pit special chicken hot link 2 ribs and brisket. On the side I got greens mashed potatoes and fries. It was done pretty quick. about 10 minutes. The ribs were pretty good. The hot link was spicy but not hot. Same goes for almost every thing else but the ribs fries brisket. I'm guessing they cook it earlier and warm it up I am not sure. I am pretty sure it was not fresh. Fries where just ok. Greens the same. Mashed potatoes where a little better. If i were to go back i would definitely probably just get ribs or a brisket or chicken sandwich. Sides taste like something on the strip. Over priced and over rated. The BBQ I would try again. Also there Ice tea wasn't that great either.
Simply the best in Vegas, Your taste buds will thank you. In our two week visit to Vegas we dined here several times. The meats melt in your mouth; the waffle chips are crunchy and tasty. The serving sizes are generous. Tried catfish for the first time. I loved it. The service is exceptional from all staff. Met the owners who are friendly and courteous. Seriously when your thinking BBQ don't go past Rollin Smoke Barbeque you will not regret it. Will definitely be going back on my next visit to Vegas.
Rollin Smoke was just ok... It's not the best bbq ive had -- i dont always go for bbqs. It's comparable to famous daves and memphis bbq but a little on the mom and pop's restaurant kind of service and ambience. Though they could use a little upgrade -- the place was tight, bbq were served on plastic basket with a wrap over the basket, sides were served in styro containers, you have to ask for plates or get it yourself if they have some out, the plastic utensils didnt look clean, sprite tasted funky or maybe it was the ice.. . We ordered the platter (good for two) with four meats -- brisket, pulled pork, chicken, ribs. Pulled pork was the best out of all of them but again average compared to other bbq place. They only have one sauce on the table and it was watery -- the kind that will squirt on your shirt. The tip of the sauce container was not as clean as my (sort of ocd when it comes to food and food handling) self hoped it would be.. . There were a few regulars but mostly tourists it seemed.... . Despite of all that ive mentioned about the place being average, it's worth a try.
O M G! This is absolutely the best BBQ I have found in either Vegas or Henderson. After reading several great reviews of this place I had to try it out. . . Ok, its not in the best area of town and doesn't look like much from the outside, but when you walk in and smell that wonderful smoke and BBQ flavor you know your gonna love it! We of course had to try the Outlaw burger made with brisket and fried onion strings as well as the brisket and rib combo plate with corn fritters. The burger was HUGE and the brisket was so tender and delicious. One of the best burgers ever. The brisket and rib plate was also great. The ribs were probably some of the best I've ever had. They were so smoky and tender and the corn fritters were golden bites of goodness. . . Our friends ordered the BBQ nachos which were waffle fries loaded with BBQ pork, cheese, beans and sour cream. So good. . . I will definitely be back to try the hot links and baby backs. Thanks for a great meal!
Hands down some of the BEST BBQ I have had in a LONG time!!! This is now my staple go-to place! Service was AWESOME! Food was PERFECT! The corn bread was like CAKE! The bacon potato salad was like Mom's but with BACON! The Mac n Cheese, was on point! Again, the experience and the service was just AMAZING!
This review is based on one visit only and the smoked brisket sandwich that I ordered. After reading all the rave reviews I was really disappointed. The brisket in the sandwich was very finely chopped instead of being sliced and it contained too much fat and gristle. I tried to doctor it up with their BBQ sauce but I didn't much care for the sauce which I assume is made in house.. . With all the favorable reviews, I have to believe that all of Rollin' Smoke's menu items just can't be as bad as that brisket. So I may give them another try to sample some of their other items. And I'll bring some of my own BBQ sauce with me. If I do, I'll update this review.
Beef (short rib) ribs where so tender and succulent! Even my wife who typically doesn't care much for BBQ really loved it.
Ok, so this is about as good as barbeque is going to get in Vegas.  That being said it doesn't quite compare with the likes of Oklahoma Joe's in KC and a few places in Texas, etc.  . . I really enjoyed this place.  It felt like a barbeque joint should feel.  It had the picnic tables, it had the great hog's head, it even had a line going out the door, which is a good sign.   I took advantage of the all you can eat, so that I could sample a little bit of everything.  The catfish was divine.  The meat was excellent and so was the sauce.  . . If you get a craving for bbq in Vegas, this is the place.
Believe the hype. I tried Rollin smoke on 8/5/14 and it was phenomenal. The meats are fresh and juicy, especially the pulled pork, but my favorite are the sides! The corn nuggets and bacon potato salad are to die for. The yams and kickin beans are also great. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Yelp said they closed at 8:00 but they were still accepting guests at 8:30 despite the open sign being turned off. They do not turn away their guests which I thought was interesting. I can't wait to go back!!
This is an AMAZING mostly locals spot! The food is SO GOOD. One of my favorites!. . BE WARNED!!!- They close at 8PM on weeknights!! Which is like a late lunch by LV standards! YES, 8PM. :-( Discovered this sadly when I brought a group of 10 people there and we arrived at 8:05PM to the door being locked in our faces. Before we even left, saw another large party arrive to be disappointed by locked doors as well. . Be there BEFORE 8PM!!!. . On the positive side, the food is SO FANTASTIC, they don't feel they need to stay open past 8PM, except on the weekends. Go early, be happy, it is worth the trip off the strip!
Absolutely delicious. Ribs and chicken were both perfectly seasoned and smoked. This is the only place I've seen corn nuggets outside of Alabama and they are crunchy and creamy sweet. Be prepared to wait because the line is usually out the door.
Legit. I had the ridiculously oversized Outlaw Burger and a side of Mac n Cheese. Wife had the chicken/brisket combo with a side of corn fritters. And it all got demolished. Do you hear me? ALL OF IT. . . Rarely am I impressed with BBQ places but Rollin Smoke had it rollin alright. Portions, taste and price were all above the standard. Its definitely part of myVegas food rotation from now on. . . Good job, gentlemen.
Wow Las Vegas best kept secret! We conciser ourselves to be expert BBQ judges this is truly authentic BBQ. Owners are from Arkansas and are very polite. The pricing was reasonable and we will be visiting this place next time were here in town. Thanks for a great lunch.
No line when we arrived, but busy. We were able to find a seat. I was surprised how small it is. . I ordered the beef ribs, and we got the waffle fries and corn nuggets. My DH ordered the spare ribs, and tot the beans with his ribs. . The service was excellent. Very nice people. The food came rather quickly. It was generous portions. Too much for 2 people. . I was only able to finish one rib, it was flavorful and had a lot of meat on it. The waffle fries were crispy, the star for me was the corn nuggets. So addicting. . My husband enjoyed his ribs, the meat fell off the bone. He said the beans were a little sweet. . All in all we had a good meal.
Great bbq for vegas.a very big portion of food and it tastes great.nice and flavorful and a nice big menu to choose from.and the sides are good to.and the deserts.this is a must do everytime you visit vegas.
Best BBQ in Las Vegas hands down. I am originally from Tennessee and have eaten a ton of BBQ. Rollin Smoke is up there with the best i had anywhere.
Came back and I think it was even better than before. We had the combo with ribs and brisket and the meatloaf (again). Sides were Mac n cheese, mashed potatoes with the meatloaf and bacon potato salad. The combo came with this melt in your mouth honey cornbread. Seriously the best BBQ I've ever had (don't tell my hubby).
Amazing amazing amazing! We fell in love and can't wait to go back. The brisket was wonderful and so was the CORNBREAD. The loaded mashed potatoes were definitely worthy of getting again. The only thing I would pass up is the Mac n cheese. Just not cheesy enough for me but everything else was so delicious!
What a great find! Imagine a Dickey's-style BBQ joint but local/downhome. Great pricing for the LARGE portions of amazing food you get. Love the hush puppies - they have a kick. The spudtastic was crazy good. Ignore the strange placement of this establishment and GO!
We decided to check this place out after reading all of the super-awesome reviews. . . The seedy neighborhood was easily overlooked when the smokey sweet smell of southern BBQ hit me. The line was out the door but no one seemed to mind the wait. The guy who took our order was a pro and very patient with our indecision and questions. Both the indoor and outdoor dining areas were clean.. . The food didn't  quite match up to the expectations, sadly. The burger was pretty dry and the peach cobbler was pretty sad. The brisket was above average, but you could tell that the ribs had been sitting for a while. . . Five stars for the service! Our server was attentive, helpful, and very friendly! . . We're going to try again when they aren't so busy. Hopefully we just caught them on a bad night.
Extremely delicious food, very friendly employees and amazing ambiance there. It feels like you are in a great barbeque fest! I absolutely recommend pork and ribs with mashed potatoes with green onions and bacon.
Hands down the best BBQ in the state of Nevada. Ribs and brisket is amazing and the corn nuggets are the best. This place in now going into my rotation of regular weekly spots.
Wow!  Smokin!  OK, I must say I really like this place a lot and for a barbecue joint, it is the highest review I can give. . . a. Location - WTF, I felt like I was driving to one of those back alley strip joints or toward that Erotic Museum.  However, I must say, driving there from the 15 Freeway was very easy!  Just in a very dingy area is all.. . b.  Size - They must have increased size,  as I was expecting a really small place with like three tables and they seemed to have expanded next door with some bench like tables to sit good size parties.  I would say though, that the max they can have in this place is like 9-10 parties of various size.. . c.  Menu - Pretty darn awesome if you ask me.  Simple to order and if you like meats you can make your own combo from the duo, trio or the Pit Special with a bunch of different meats. They even have large party size orders on the menu.  The brisket was great, the beef ribs darn good. I always order baby back pork ribs so these beef ribs were the right size and very tasty.  I loved the hot links and I did not care so much for the pulled pork, a bit dry if you ask me.  . . d.  Hot Sauce - On the table were two types of sauces, and neither was too hot.  I did use quite a bit on the pulled pork. I generally like a hot sauce. I did not ask them, and I wonder if they have it.. . e.  Friendly - The owners and workers here are all very friendly, ask about their food and they want you to enjoy your experience.  That is such a cool added touch!. . f.  Ordering, drinking and etc - You order at the front and pay, but they bring the food to you.  The soda fountain and the ice tea area are in a small and tight area, so if it is busy, it will be tough to get to. . . g. Leftovers - They plenty of serve yourself plastics for any leftovers you have.. . h.  The sides - Plenty of sides.  The potato salad was awesome. The beans were great, the corn nuggets were totally cool.  These were the only sides we had.. . Results - Awesome finger licking food, great pricing and great service.  Loved it better than Famous Dave's and Lucille's. GK says check it out.
After reading many reviews the hubby and I decided to give this place a chance and let me tell you it was a HUGE disappointment. Don't get me wrong the staff was really nic e and the place was clean but, the food was totally different. First they got my hubbys order wrong, second our food came out COLD not warm cold, third my Rib Tips were so dry and though most of it was inedible, Fourth all the food that came out was sooo dry and flavorless it had no salt.  What a let down and waste money.    Oh and by the way this food also gave us upset stomach and disgusting burps.  Ps i recommend the Roadkill which beats this place by far.
Very good BBQ, first time here, the sauce is what makes it for me, a little cayenne pepper in the barbecue makes it good with just a little kick, I had brisket and ribs and both were tender, brisket is better imo
This review is on the food only because we took it togo.  I read all of the review and it seemed like a good bar b que restaurant.  We ordered the brisket, ribs, hot links, peach cobbler and the banana pudding.  I do not believe they gave the banana pudding the name of grandma's banana pudding, this didn't taste like any grandmas pudding I ever tasted (it was awful).  Everything we ordered was awful. If we stayed at the restaurant we would have sent everything back and got our money back.  We  ate a few bites and threw the rest of it in the trash.  This was a waste of my money since I spend about fifty dollars on the horrible food.
We walked to this place from the strip. The walk is through some less than glamorous streets but it is totally worth it. My wife had a spudtastic which was huge and delicious. She had it with pulled pork on it-- great choice. I went for the brisket dog which was amazing. It is a hot link with brisket, cheese, and a huge pile of fried onions. The service was great. The ambiance was, well, appropriate. Bottom line, I would go here again and again.
Best BBQ in Vegas out of the seven or eight places I've tried. Amazing whole in the wall kind of place, but with plenty of seating. They could probably fill up a restaurant the size of Olive Garden if they wanted to. Food is amazing. Had the brisket sandwich with fried onion straws. Pretty sure I could live off that the rest of my life breakfast lunch and dinner! Yummy! Hubby had the outlaw burger. He's a big dude and couldn't eat it all. Might wanna bring a friend to take on that brisket burger!
Love this barbecue. It's a small little shack that serves great barbecue.. . I haven't had much barbecue out here and was skeptical of how good barbecue could be, but yes, there is good barbecue in Las Vegas.. . I've only been twice and both times I got their duo plate.. . With these plates you get the option to choose from: Brisket, hot links, spare ribs, 1/4 chicken, and pork.. . I got the brisket and hot link.. . The brisket is very juicy and you can see the beautiful smoke ring around the edge of the meat. . . The hot link has a nice snap to it and is definitely one of my favourite parts of the meal. . . Along with the meat you get an option of a side and I've gotten the mac n cheese and the potato salad.. . The mac n cheese was alright, nothing too special, but I do love their potato salad. It's creamy and the potatoes are still firm. It's a nice refreshing taste when eaten with the rest of the meal.. . Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quick lunch or just in the mood for some barbecue!
I want to write a review where I describe "how I love putting meat in my mouth", but I'm seriously too full and happy to be witty.  Plain and simple, the brisket and pulled pork were delicious.  They come pretty sauce-less.  Don't fuck it up by throwing 2 gallons of BBQ sauce on them, kids.  I mean, the sauce is legit, but the flavor of the smoke in the meat is amazing.  The jalapeno slaw wasn't super jalapeno-y, which is good.  You could tell there was a kick, but it didn't overpower it.  The greens would have made Popeye's eyeballs explode.  Mine were boss-level.  I do dig greens, though, so I might be biased.... . All in all, 6 meals for my coworkers for $77, plus tip, was definitely worth it.
I had the outlaw burger with fries. The fries were ok but the burger was oh so yummy!! It had strips of fried onion, cabbage, lettuce and tomato. Pickles and a banana pepper on top. It was huge!!! I could only finish about a third of it. . . Guy at the register warned me the burger would be big. It was a lot more than I had expected. . . Also had a plate with brisket and pork. (Not pictured). Also very yummy.. . They're open kinda late. Located NEAR desert inn and highland. . . On the other part of the place- through a different door- you'll find the hog fish tank that was featured on Tank'd!!! How awesome is that? :) . . I'm not usually a fan of BBQ but I'll definitely be coming back here to try other things from their menu.
BBQ place that just don't go wrong.. I ordered the PIT Special and it was delicious!  The brisket was so soft it melts away in your mouth, the sauce is so good and it's on every table! So you can pour as much as you want.. All over them ribs! Chicken!! Hot link!! Anything!!  The chicken was the same as many bbq place, but the Hotlink are made special and it has a nice kick to it!  Don't forget the sides... Ordered the loaded mash, cheesey mac and the fries.. All delicious! And come with big portions!  So id you want a good BBQ meal with a good price this is it!  Worth 19.98 for the pit special w/drink...so come down and give this local area a try...
Literally the best ribs, best food period that's really all I have to say if you want good real "legit" ribs how there supposed to be cooked try rollin smoke they mean everything they say and have the food to back it up would suggest this place to everyone! . . . P.S: my favorite rib is the beef rib but I always get the rib platter special which is a great price and features every single rib for you to try :) I like to order an extra rollin smoke bbq sauce if it's an to go order just to pour on my ribs cause there literally right off the grill, hope this helped.
THE place for BBQ in Vegas. Check in on Yelp and get a free dessert. The people working here are super friendly and helpful. If you're not a local, do yourself a favor and leave the strip for this place!!
The food is delicious! I am in love with the cheesy Mac n cheese and their corn bread! It's a must!
It may not be near our neighborhood but it's worth the drive. In my hungry gals opinion it's the best BBQ we've found in Vegas
I ordered brisket with nacho fries with outlaw burger. Ordered before my cousin and he got only the outlaw burger with Mac, and he got his order first. And I look across of me and I see a guy that ordered his food after me, and he got the same exact burger before they got my order. . So I ask the waiter why he got the burger before me when I ordered before him, and he just simply said that yours is coming up, playing it off knowing that he messed up. . So after 10 mins later they bring my food, but I only  got my fries no burger. Waiter said its coming right out. . After another 10 mins I finally get it. Was kind of hard to enjoy my food. But nevertheless fries were good and the burger was just as good. And the price for all the food was just. I would of given 4 stars if they didn't mess up my order and not try to play it off that it wasn't the waiters fault.. Don't get me wrong I would definitely come back again and hopefully get better service.
The excellent reviews were appealing enough to draw me here. I wasn't disappointed. Beef rib and sides were very tasty! Can't wait to come back and try more options!
Probably the best American bbq spot to go to in Vegas
This place has some of the best BBQ I've ever had. The pulled pork absolutely melted in my mouth! I didn't have a sandwich, yet, and I can't wait to try one.
Hands down the best barbecue spot I've been to in Vegas. Highly recommend the brisket and ribs. Mac & cheese and corn bread is also pretty bomb.
