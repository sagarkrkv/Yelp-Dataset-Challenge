All I can say is WOW, their buffet is amazing. They have a variety of desserts, including ice cream. The chicken fajitas were tasty. They had mini shrimp in some kind of sauce i ate like 3 dozen of those alone. The M sider was amazing. Unlimited drinks and beer was something new, most las vegas buffets don't offer that. I usually come here every month, because the buffet is that good.
Ox tail?! Omg. Food is delicious.  Surprisingly good food and good service. Arguably the best and most affordable buffet in Vegas. Definitely a must.
We are here on Wed. First the service amazing wonderful (Don N Sylvin).They clean up the plates right away for u. Napkin, drinks u don't need to ask they were refilled for u even u r not done yet. The place is clear N a lot of space between tables. We love the food N dessert here too.
I probably came at the wrong time (dinner) and the wait lines were ridiculously long. I probably had to wait an hour to get inside and the manager seemed to be incompetent with handling patrons that night. The food overall was alright. The vegetables were excellent and so were the side dishes, but the steak was very tough and chewy and kind of lacked flavor. The way the food stations were setup was kind of confusing at first since it was one giant food station compared to specialized food stations. Service was average and the ambiance was nice. Overall, this buffet is nice, but I'd much rather head to the Carnival at Rio or Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace for the same money.
Decor is nice. Food is decent. However, service is way below par for a place like this. The wait just to get in was extremely painful.  There were lots of tables available. ..but took like 15 min after we paid in order to get seated.  I found out why after we got our food. They are severely under staffed. Every time we needed something, the waitress would just pass us by because she was dealing with a million things at once. Not her fault, but then she looked grumpy...and the lack of service shows. Probably won't be back.
I tried the Sunday seafood , I was very disappointed with the seafood,  very bad quality,  oyster was very old!  I can't believe they charge 40 for that quality.  I only eat one oyster. The prime rib is good, my two star is vote for the rib and dessert only.
The positives: prime rib, kalbi, ox tail soup, wine & beer included in the price.. . The negatives:  all the seafood tasted old.  The crawfish tasted especially bad.. . Overall, I would not come back even for the price they are offering for this buffet.
Best idea ever. If you're heading out from socal, stop here before heading into Vegas. The only downside is that the line gets ridiculously long. We waited an hour and a half... but what's a Vegas buffet without the wait?. . The food was good. We were starving by the time we got in, so everything tasted amazing. The prime rib was a little dry and too well done for my liking, but it was still good with the au jus and the horseradish. Crab legs...well, I can eat those for days. I did get a lot of the korean style short ribs. It was very delicious!! I don't personally eat oysters, but they didn't look as fresh and my friend also said that they didn't taste as good. All the other things I tried were pretty good (oxtail soup, fried gyozas, lobster mac&cheese, shrimp scampi, veggie pad thai, stuff I don't remember). . Their desserts bar is decent. I love love getting all the desserts in the little cups. My favorite is the panna cotta with the rasberry compote on top. The pistachio one with chocolate is pretty good too. I didn't really try any of the baked goods. They have THAI TEA GELATO.. which taste exactly like thai tea. so yummy. . . UNLIMITED ALCOHOL!! They don't have an extensive list of alcohol available but they do have a variety. I believe they have a red/white wine, champagne, cider, and beer. They also have this root beer (non-alcoholic) that is very good. It's like one of those hand crafted root beers..not like A&W. . . Overall, great food and great price. Even if you had to pay the $40.. it's not bad for a seafood buffet and unlimited alcohol. I would definitely come here again! :)
My favorite buffet in Vegas! All you can drink mimosas and hard cider! YES!!!!  I dream about this place and swear ill visit every trip to Vegas, I usually don't, but it's a great buffet. I have to agree with others regarding freshness and why there is so many open tables when there is a big line. I've gone twice and by the grace of God have been able to get right in on a weekend both times. Ill return to this buffet every chance i get!
Here is another five star. Both myself and my husband agree to that. The food was great.. . The wait was really long for a buffet. Then abouT 20 minuTes in line, at 1:30 in the afternoon. Couldn't figure out why it took so long, there were quite a few empty tables when we walked in.. . Service was pretty good we had a really nice waitress.. . The lamb shoulder was way too gamey for me. The creamed spinach didn't work for either one of us. Evrrything else we tried was really good. I tried a little bit of as much as I possibly could ;-). . Beer and wine are included. So I try something I never had the cider. It's called the M cider. It's made specifically for the M hotel. And it's really good. I'm hoping at some time they bottle and sell it.
