First impression great, feels like California. Shrimp and grits love it and the cinnamon biscuit yummy. I love the crunch on the pancakes. I wish they had andouille sausage and or Portuguese sausage with the shrimp and grits, still very good.
Trip 2 to eat.  Just as ahhh-amazing as last time.  I had the Downtown Benedict.  Their hollandaise is super creamy and just the right balance of flavors.  I'm not a fan of cooked tomatoes so next time I'll order it without it but the spinach is a great addition to the classic Benedict.  . . Sat at the counter this time and had a blast watching the kitchen.  We couldn't believe how efficiently they pump out such delicious food.  Young blonde expeditor was great to watch her control the kitchen! Super job! . . Oh we'll be back....soon!
My husband loved his Downtown Eggs Benedict and the coffee was good and strong. My shrimp and grits was more like seafood chowder. There was so much sauce I couldn't get a good bite of grits. The shrimp was pure rubber. Expect a bit of a wait but good for downtown.
Food is deliciously comfortable.  Small local charm is evident in the dining room.  Local ownership has been here during both of my visits.  Feels good to join them for breakfast.  Oh and yeah those Deviled Eggs are the most wonderful thing since before sliced bread.  They weren't on the menu but they were so yummy we could have had more of them as our meal.
Love this place.  Shrimp and grits!  Thoughtful menu.  Well prepared. Great flavors.
Just, perfectly good! Our Server was simply AWESOME which made the food & the experience that much better! The cinnamon bread brunch "app" was just pure YUMMINESS!!! The Chicken Fried Steak was GREAT but that gravy was AMAZING! The grits, were GREAT!
The food was awesome!  I had the two eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast which was awesome!  I also tried the deviled eggs which were coated in panko, these were so delicious..I don't think I can eat regular deviled eggs now!  My nephew had the short stack of pancakes with blueberries..they were able delicious!  Had the fresh strawberry lemonade to drink..yummy!  Excellent service from our server sheana to the host and busser!  I will be back!
3.5 stars.  What a fun place this is.  The shrimp and grits were a little bland and made watery by the fresh tomatoes in the dish; also, I found a clot or two of grits in my entree (~$11).  The side of one pancake was delightful (~$3).  It was light and fluffy and just what I expected of a pancake.  The chilaquiles were a-ok (~$11).  I wish they used thicker corn chips though.  The panko crusted deviled eggs were good (a special and not on the menu, ~$8).  The corned beef hash was pretty great and definitely didn't come out of a can (~$11). . . Other important info: service was great, located in downtown, metered street parking, trendy/hipster joint, closed early, everything tastes like it was homemade and made from scratch.
Fantastic.  Got the shrimp and grits it was so good. Staff is amazing. Sat at the bar and watched the chef and crew in action. Lemme tell you watch if I could of ate everything that came out of the kitchen I would. It looked soooo good. This is a must go while in Vegas. You can beat good food and good folks!  Come to Eat!
Really a 3.75.  I had the shrimp and grits.  I too though they were watery like many of the reviews here.  I love shrimp and grits and have it it all over the south.  If EAT would just tighten them up a bit with some sort of cheese it would make them loads better.  My friend had the truffled egg sandwich and he said it was great.  . . Be warned, it's very loud so don't expect to have much of a conversation.
I love eating breakfast and brunch here.  Great food and amazing ambience.
Great comfort food...absolutely love everything they bring to dining...food..vibe...service.. . The best country fried steak I have ever eaten.
Amazing food with great service. Had the shrimp and grits with a pancake. Everything was cooked to perfection.  The presentation nice with a great aroma and delicious flavors. A must try.
EAT ... ATE ... Enjoyed it!. . Corned Beef Hash ($14): Chunks of corned beef with savory potatoes, 2 poached eggs and 4 pieces of sourdough toasted to perfection. Realy enjoyed the toast here. The portion size was fair but a little on the pricier side for a brunch item. . . Eggs Benedict ($13): Wasn't my favorite item =/ breadding on bottom was sweet and turkey bacon was used instead of regular. Poo. I love turkey bacon but a girl's trying to get some delicious bad food in me while in Vegas!! However, the caramelized onions and potatoes were on point.. . Free-Range Chicken Sandwich ($12): This dish sounds average and something you can get anywhere but my oh my. The chicken wasn't dry. The pesto, mozzarella cheese and pesto blend was beyond perfect. I tried savoring every last bite of it! YUM. I tend to lean more on brunch items during brunch hours but this dish is one to get!. . All dishes were decently sized. Hipster type of atmosphere. Location is off.. it's underneath an apartment/studio complex! Lots of metered street parking for $1/hour. Something to try while out in Vegas!
Shrimp & grits & a shrimp po boy. Believe the hype people!! Would've done 5 stars but service kinda lagged altho it wasn't super busy our waiter left our drinks empty for a awhile..but food is 5 stars for sure !
This place is probably one of the best places I ate during the 4 days I was in Las Vegas. It's a little off the beaten path, 2-3 blocks from Freemont and off the Strip in general but this place was PACKED on Saturday morning. I came in a group of 6 people and we were told it would be about a 20-30 minute wait; no big deal to us since the place looked very busy. When we did sit down our waitress was super friendly and we got our drinks quickly; the sparkling strawberry lemonade was possibly the best lemonade I'd had on the trip. I got a Chicken Fried Steak and I have to say it was the best one I've had at a restaurant ever. The gravy was what you want in a gravy; those superb lumps of bacon/sausage with that peppery bite. The steak was cooked to perfection, tasty on the inside and well seasoned with an awesome amount of crunch on the outside all served on top of eggs and potatoes. The potatoes were perfectly cooked, soft on the inside and that golden sear on the outside. Waitress was super friendly and had a great sense of humor! The wait for the tables in a big group is worth is 100% and if I ever go back to Las Vegas this is definitely on the list of places I would eat at again.
I've eaten here twice now. The food was good but on the second trip I noticed the waitresses doing the 'touchdown' when refilling water. This turned my stomach and could no longer drink my water. It is also very noisey at lunch time so much so that I can't hear the people at the same table with me.
Perky, edgy, chill/energy and executes eggs/ toast to perfection. Kinda what humans would set up if they weren't at war in "dawn planet of the apes" with protective fencing - but I'm bananas for this place $4 oj was surprising but hey it was good, they're next to tesla super charger and it's Vegas... Superfine service at counter from Ally (sp?)
Worst service ever! Walked at 2:28 and they would not even seat our party of 7. 3 different hosts were very rude and explained that they can close whenever they like even though a time of 3pm is shown everywhere for a Friday. Very disappointed at such a waste of time and such rudeness by 3 different members of their staff. As a local I will NOT be coming back ever again!
Food was fantastic and unique. We tried their deviled eggs appetizer, amazing!!!!! The heuvos motulenos dish was tasty and different. However, very worth a try. Staff was friendly and johnny on the spot.
Get out your GPS and hunt this joint down. Well worth the trip if you are an out-of-towner in search of seriously good eats.
Incredible little place downtown. Made me feel like I was back in Chicago, not downtown Las Vegas.
I would give it 3.75. Never would guess a cool little breakfast spot would be located under some shady apartments on 7th street. Sat at the bar and ate. Could see right into the very small kitchen. I only had scrambled eggs and bacon which are nothing to rave about but it's hard to mess those up. Some of the other dishes that came out of the kitchen looked great!  I'll have to try the pancakes next time!  Would definitely come back.
Great food. The fueled eggs are awesome.  A must try!! The staff was friendly and good with orders.
Came here yesterday for a late breakfast/ lunch & it was just as good as I anticipated. We were, luckily, seated right before it started to get busy (around 12/ 1 p.m.) & we ordered a few diff things - Deviled Eggs on special, the Truffled Egg Sandwich, Reuben, & 2 orders of the Tofu Scramble... Everyone was happy with their food (including me), but I did find my entire Tofu Scramble dish unnecessarily covered in oil; But I tried hard to look past that since there was such a good dish underneath. As if it didn't already sound good enough, it tasted even better! I loved the mushrooms & sprouts, & even thought the thick-cut wheat toast was noteworthy - Everything just really worked! The recipe itself is a great one & I would order this over & over again. While the service started off good, with the workers carrying drinks & explaining the specials right away, it unfortunately depleted throughout our meal & I wasn't much of a fan by the time we left. Some workers were okay but our actual waitress neglected us the entire time we were there, failed to check on us even once, & completely ignored a question/ concern we had about the food & did nothing to help us fix the problem we addressed. Even though it wasn't a big deal, I feel she could have done a much better job esp. after seeing someone else quickly resolve our issue for us, when they weren't even the one that was supposed to be waiting on our table. I also have to say that I hate when people put the bill down on the table MINUTES after we've just received food, but I suppose this was her way of saying that she was done with our table & no longer planned to do much else for us... As this was clearly indicative of her service thereafter. She hardly even deserved a tip since she did next to nothing, but we tried to be nice. Anyway, I am only giving this place 5 stars for the food & environment, not the service. . Also, you must pay & park in the street. They do not have any designated parking, so it will cost you a couple bucks while you eat here :p Thus turning a 15-20$ meal into something over 20 bucks... May be worth it though!
I live right around the corner from this place and finally gave it a shot.  The food was excellent. I just had eggs, bacon and potatoes but they were damn good. The service was good but there could have been they need more sense of urgency, of course me being a server myself and always working in very fast paced establishments may tend to be a little more critical and pay way to much attention to every detail when going out to eat.  The decor is amazing and very charming. Over all outstanding dining experience.
Thanks to the visionary genius of Lord Tony (Hsieh) of Zappos fame and the collaboration of the DTP (DownTown Project), the panhandlers, hookers, and homeless are slowly being edged out by the hipsters, geeks and startups.  . . I work downtown, and there are a few (very few) good places to eat in the area.  Container Park has a few, and right across the street from Container Park is eat.  It's convenient to our office, so this is what tends to entice a lot of us to pick something up.. . eat is loud, always crowded, and fast-paced.  I do feel, however, that the food is a skitch overpriced.  I walked in on Tuesday (8/19) and was informed of a fabulous pulled pork sandwich special.  I agreed, but when she rang it up? $16.  $16? This pork sandwich better make me sing in the streets!. . Overall, the food is good, but I think they hype lends itself to a little smidgen of price gouging.
Showed up at 2:30 on a Thursday. Right before the kitchen closed. The server was friendly and recommended the truffle egg sandwich. The food took not even 10 minutes. It was fantastic. The egg was fluffy, the bread was light and buttery oooo. One star less because parking sucks.
Stopped in here for a late breakfast. After being seated asked the server how they brewed the coffee. "Ugh in a machine." Yeah thought I could possibly get an espresso or pour over. Order the downtown eggs Benedict. Came out soggy and over salted. Husband ordered the chicken fried steak and say he won't be back.
Decided to make a trip downtown to check out the Container Park and thought  it would be a great time to finally try this much lauded eatery (8/3/14)!  It was 1 pm (an hour before they close) and raining outside and we were told the wait would be approximately 30 minutes.  I anticipated this, brought an umbrella, and my husband and his son ran down to check out the famous O-Face Donuts (win-win as I would now have three places checked off on my Yelp bucket list!).  Near the half-hour mark, the hostess came outside and told me it would not be much longer and offered the counter but I declined.  There was room to wait inside so I went in.  Two people came  in and they were almost immediately taken to a table (albeit by a different hostess/staff) which did irritate me as we were now hitting the 40 minute mark.  The other hostess returned and must have noticed what had occurred and told me we would have a table right away (and I did see her talk to the other server).  . . We sat down (with our O-Face donut loot ).  Our server came over and took our drink order.  He was friendly but he did appear to be slightly ready to be" done" (it was now very close to 2 pm) for the day (and I completely sympathize with that).  We quickly made up our minds; Killer grilled cheese with kick-ass tomato soup for moi; pancakes with bacon (a substitute for the apple-chicken sausage) for my step-son; corned beef hash for my husband.  It did not seem very long before our food was served but gave us time to take in the decor.  I loved it- especially the tall divider structure at the entrance with the plants (figuring out how to do that at home).   My husbands only minor (very minor) complaint was the chair that he sat in seemed to have a hollow cushion and it caused him to be seated at an awkward height (but it was worse when I sat in it as I'm much shorter!) but not enough to dampen his appetite or our total experience.  The food arrived and it looked wonderful.  My husband loved the corned beef hash (its his baseline food item order to which all places are measured by).  He determined it to be in 2nd place to Bagel Cafe (a very high compliment)- but it could be "in the running".  I enjoyed my grilled cheese very much but the soup slightly reminded me of marinara sauce (not necessarily a bad thing but I couldn't get that out of my mind). My step-son really liked his pancakes and bacon and could not finish it and offered us a bite.  THOSE PANCAKES!  Not sure what is in them but they were incredible!  I had to have another bite!  . . I'm not sure when we will venture out again( but I am dying to try on a week-day as the menu seems to slightly vary) but we definitely agreed that we would want to come back.  This is a place that every Las Vegan should try at least once!
I have been here a number of times and usually everything is just about perfect.. . They are getting a 3 because the food is amazing.... . The problem this time is the service has been beyond dysfunctional...a call for our name and table that never happened...35 minute plus wait times for food...an unbelievable amount of flies as we wait in the heat for our food... . And it's now just here.... . More attention to detail makes a difference in the execution.. . Love the food but don't like the dysfunction.
I was looking for a place to get a quick breakfast and Yelp directed me to eat. The name is interesting by itself, but the interior of the place is nicely intriguing as well. eat. is a small, clean restaurant with a 'young' vibe. I was seated quickly and ordered a pretty standard meal- scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast. Although it is a simple order, eat. managed to impress. The eggs were very smooth, the bacon nice and crispy, and the toast was perfect- it had a very 'homemade' flavor. In addition to the great breakfast, our waiter was very friendly and helpful.. . A unique, simple, and tasty place to eat.
I love how fresh the ingredients are. i had their eggs Benedict and everything tasted so farm fresh like it was just picked that morning. Had the biscuits and strawberries before breakfast and it was the most amazing thing I have had in a while. We came on a weekday after 9am and were seated right away. . . I would've giventhem a 5-star, but I've been here for lunch and it was so loud, had to wait to get a table and I had a tummy-ache afterwards. . . For breakfast however, I would come back, but I'll pass on lunch.
Lovely place to eat. I've been here three times and each time was great.
I really wanted to like this place.. It is trendy place with a good vibe.  But.... While the service was great the food was average at best.  I got Shrimp and Grits, the presentation was awesome but the food lacked flavor, the shrimp were medium sized and the grits were awful, clumpy and tasted instant. For the price ... My expectations were much, much higher.  My friend got the hash and again looked nice but once you dug in... All you got was very expensive fried potatoes. Not sure I will give them another chance.. Their prices are just to high to get average food.
