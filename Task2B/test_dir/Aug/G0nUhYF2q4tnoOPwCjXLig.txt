The only thing I want in a hotel is a clean room and decent service.  The Excalibur gave us that so I was happy.
It was okay.  We stayed two nights.  Family of five in two rooms.  We stayed in Tower 2 which is supposedly the nicer of the two.  It really was fine, nothing bad or gross.  The bathrooms were quite nice.  However, the furnishings are tired and worn.  It was definitely not a fresh hotel.  I imagine it's because these rooms see non-stop action and abuse.  . . As for location, I would have preferred to stay in New York, New York instead.  Anytime we wanted to go to the strip we had to make our way through casinos, tunnels, stairs, escalators, etc. just to get to NYNY and then we were on the strip.
Pros: Fairly clean, free parking. . Cons: No WiFi, shower is 5'8" tall, constantly berated by staff to purchase packages for the future, zero mildly healthy restaurant choices, few TV stations, no decent bars
Go to the spa here! Do it....don't even think about not going, just do it. The staff is fantastic and pleasant and helpful and fantastic. I had the best pedicure I've ever had. The spa is beautiful and relaxing. It was one of my favorite parts of my last trip to Las Vegas. . . The hotel is good too; comfy beds, good security, excellent pool; it is cleanl. (it could use a remodel, but it really isn't terrible.). . Everyone and I'm talking about every single employee that I encountered at this hotel; the check-in desk, the security guards, the pool hosts and servers--all of them were outstanding. Amazing service and so many friendlly people. Well done to the HR department at the Excalibur, you've hired an amazing staff. . . We were on a girls' trip, so we didn't use the fun dungeon or the food court, but the buffet was delightful. And there is a wristband that lets you eat all day in the Excalibur and the Luxor for only $35.99. . . Also, the adults only pool is awesome. Use it if you can.
I just spent two nights at the Excalibur for my Birthday. We came in on early Monday afternoon, and were immediately greeted by the valet and luggage guys. They welcomed us with open arms and we're very fast. The front desk staff were so fast and helpful. We only waited a few minutes and we're checked in and our room was ready. . . The room was okay. It was a good size room, clean and had a very specious bathroom.  It had everything you need while in Vegas. We were in the newly remodeled tower, tower 2. The view from our window was absolutely amazing. We were able to see a large portion of the strip. If I had to knock anything about our room, it would be that the shower floor was a little slippery and that the beds were very hard. But we didn't spend much time in the room other than to sleep and shower.. . The casino had a wide selection of slots and table games, so you definitely won't be bored. Many of the slots include many of the Vegas classics and many of the newest games. They also have a decent poker room with affordable poker tournaments.. . The hotel also has many restaurants to choose from, including buffets, sit down restaurants and fast food. All decent and the food court is open 24 hours.. . Decent amount of shops with a wide selection of products.. . The location of the Excalibur is fantastic. Being on the south end of the strip, it's right across the street from the MGM, New York New York and Tropicana. It's also connected on the inside and by trams to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay.. . Overall, I had a great time and the hotel delivered. It's staff is amazing and it has the essentials to make a great Vegas getaway.. . I would definitely stay here again.
It hurts me to have to leave a negative review for the Excalibur this time around, but my second experience here was pretty bad. This review covers both the hotel and the casino. . . HOTEL. - I made my reservations over two months prior, and upon arrival they told me they didn't have the 2 queen beds I requested, only a king bed. I was there with another male friend and we are not sharing a bed. They said the only option was for them to give us a rollaway bed, which housekeeping haphazardly left in the hallway so we were left to carry it in to the room. Fortunately, I got a supervisor and a nice girl at concierge to upgrade us the next day for the issue, but this still costs the Excalibur some points. You don't offer a type of room to someone that they select based on their plans and then give it away to someone else who made later reservations. By comparison, you don't order front row seats at a concert and show up at will call to be told that they gave your seat away and that you're now sitting in the back. If the hotel is out of rooms of a certain type - gray them out on the website! Basic reservation logic. . - Excalibur used to be good at getting through lines quickly. Now the lines are at a stand still and over 150 patrons are being waited on by a maximum of 3 agents. . - The moving walkway was under construction which closed down two-thirds of the walkway to New York New York. Even more irritating is this walkway was under construction when I was here in March. What's taking so long?. . CASINO. I only played once at Excalibur this time and it's for reasons such as this:. - Before I could even sit down, one of the dealers, Fang, rudely shouted at me "ID!" I understand there are rules but you can ask politely for my card, not bark it like a military order. The folks at other casinos understand this and also realize that if you're a dick to me, you don't get tipped.. - I played for over a half hour while the pit boss was standing right behind the table flirting with another female employee. He was less than a foot from my players card but didn't pick it up to rate my initial play. I asked Fang what was taking so long and she said she had the card waiting for him when he did his rounds. I had to loudly say "it's been there for a half hour and hasn't been touched, he's not doing his job" before she asked him to run it. He was a nice guy in the end but not very attentive, especially when you're job description is to pay attention to the tables. . . Excalibur refused to give me any comps on this trip because I didn't have enough play at Excalibur. Well, maybe if your dealers didn't suck, I would play here more! But instead, I go to the Bellagio where the dealers have class and are good entertainers.. . Dealers: be nice or you don't get tips. Simple as that!
This hotel is very kid friendly with the "fun dungeon" and jousting show. The arcade games are a bit pricy and the show is expensive. The room are ok they are very small and the beds aren't that comfortable this hotel is definitely just a place to sleep not to hang out it
Stayed here for a fun trip with some guys from work. We all wanted to stay in close together and Excalibur was conveniently located to Luxor and Monte Carlo. . . The rooms are plain and not well appointed. The service at the front desk was friendly and efficient. The gave a free room upgrade to one of the groups in our party which was nice. The casino looked clean but clearly was showing age.. . Overall a satisfactory hotel and casino.
5 Stars for the Excalibur!!!. . What's WRONG with all you one-star haterz and malcontents? I know what's wrong with about 75% of you--your reviews are FAKE, you have no yelp friends and hardly any other reviews posted.. . I LOVE this place! It represents everything I like about the Vegas Strip experience. (I couldn't give a rat's behind about posers in rented Lamborghini's, imprisoned albino tigers or girls who are essentially hookers who think they are the most amazing things to ever walk the earth even though they've never read a book.). . The front desk gets FIFTEEN STARS! It is gigantic and fully-staffed with happy, friendly, smiling, efficient, accommodating, good-looking personnel who know why they're there, and DO THEIR JOB!. . In the 2 times I've stayed here, they moved enormous lines through in a few short minutes that would have taken the worthless lumps of meat at the Riviera front desk, several ice ages to deal with.. . The better rooms are clean and really nice, but some of the appointments are old-school. The 2 that I've stayed in have been quiet and relaxing. There are lots of kids around, but for some reason they don't bother me here. It's full of tourists which makes the people watching and the poker room lots of fun. There is nothing over the top here, but there are all kinds of fun and cool things around, like a Baja Fresh(!), a steak house where vegans like me can order a fantastic baked potato and steamed spinach AND use an incredible $20 coupon they give you at check-in! If you crave the snazzier Strip experience just transport yourself up the street and have at it to your heart's content.. . So if you average my 15 stars for the front desk down after all the other considerations, I still give this a solid 5 Stars. (And that doesn't mean I'm deducting 10 stars. I'm using fuzzy math here.)
Have stayed at Excalibur many times throughout the years. I had called while on the way to Vegas driving to reserve a room. Was told on the phone that would be cheaper to make reservation online because I would be charged 10.00 to do over phone. What the heck? So went online reserved room. Got a email and two rooms were reserved instead of one. Called to resolve the problem. Was hung up on, put on hold indefinitely, told I could not get money back cancellation policy was 48 hours. Finally after 2 hours decided to deal with once in Vegas. The girl who helped us check in was very helpful. refunded money, upgraded us, and gave us a late check out. After checking in and paying it was the same price as I was quoted over the phone. They don't tell you online that there is a 20 resort fee. . . Another thing is make sure you eat before it gets late. The food places all shut down. This is something new since last time I was in Vegas. Always had a 24 coffee shop open. After walking upstairs and downstairs and all around per the staff telling us of food places that may be open. We ended up at 2 in the morning at New York New York which apparently is the only restaurant open near Excalibur for food.
This Hotel  -  along with the rest of Las Vegas - has gone too extreme with the Security...  One Bicycle Security Guard ( Joseph ) followed me around the parking lot. So, because of my experience with Joe the security guard -  I took my gambling money elsewhere...and  - Just like other reviewers have written - on another day -  I was asked for my ID... Hey, Las Vegas! I am on Vacation! ...Not visiting a third world socialist country!!! This is still America right??? I go to a Casino to have a fun experience - not to be treated like this.
This place was our last minute hotel. We made reservations at the MGM but stuff happened. Anyway, this place is worth the cheap price. But you get what you pay for. . . Pros:. * Hotel has a decent food court and Dicks last Resort is here . * Hotel location is on the strip. * Hotel directly connects to Mandalay Bay. * Hotel has friendly staff. . Cons:. * Air conditioner in the room sucks. * Non smoking room smells like smoke. * Appliances in hotel room doesn't work. * Terrible parking structure. * Kids everywhere. * Small casino area. * Packed pools. . Overall I enjoyed my stay for the price
My daughter and I stayed in an upgraded room in tower 2 with a view.  Check in was pain free and they moved a large line very quickly.  The room was clean and the beds are very comfortable.  The hotel itself is a little dated; but, it appears to be well maintained.  . . Lots of kids including mine at the pool and all over.  I would recommend the hotel for families and I would pick a different hotel for a guys or girls weekend.
WOW.  they musta put some $$ since the last time i was here, like 10 years ago.  Went for the Tournament of Kings show...so walked around the casino beforehand.  everything seemed more contemporary.  Food court is even not as ghetto!  Pretty pretty pleased with the updates.  Would I stay here?  ummm, no.  but i would go back.
Would not recommentd.  The rooms were very outdated.   Our roomalso had a weird smell to it.  During our stay we got locked in our hotel. Locked in. We had to call room service to let us out of the room !   Worst stay at a Las Vegas hotel so far.
Went to Vegas with the family for the first time ( I had been as a single person many times).  I was reluctant to book at this hotel because of some bad reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The pool was nice, the staff were great.  It is not a 5 star hotel, but it is a pretty good place to stay if you have kids, there is entertainment and food court, met our needs perfectly.  I do wish they had WiFI in the rooms, kids like to use their electronics in the room before bed.
My Wife and I stayed at the Excalibur for the first week of our honeymoon.. . Trying to find the area where you check in is a challenge (as it is with most of the large hotels/casinos in Vegas), you get constantly harassed by people in the Hotel trying to sell you shows, and the Casino is always smelling bad unlike some of the other hotels who filter it very well.. . The room is very basic. No icebox/mini fridge, very few channels, etc. Overall, the Excalibur is a low class hotel with cheap prices and is good for doing one thing: Saving your money to do other things in Vegas. This was the reason we stayed, except when you walk into the the other Hotels such as Venetian, Caesar's Palace and NYNY, you realize how low class Excalibur is.. . Next time, we will likely stay somewhere else such as New York New York, if we even go to Vegas at all anytime soon.
We stayed here for 4 days and 3 nites. We choose this hotel due to price and location.  All worked out great. Booked the room via Mlife. ...worth it. We always take an extremely early flight to Vegas as to not waste a minute.  We arrived at 7:30am not expecting a room to be ready. Early check in is an additional $20 +tax which would be 10am. However they had a room ready for us...room 24258.  It had a great view! Okay okay so the room wasn't as clean as it could be.....pubes in the shower, dust everywhere and someone's Hersey kiss flags.  I'm not in Vegas to be in my room. So the pubes were taken care of and everything was A-OK. The ice buckets are super small. ....use 2 garage cans...fill your sink up with ice and boom you have an ice chest.  Buy your beer at the CVS, a 30 pack of coors light was $30... $1 a beer sweet! In the food court right at the top of the stairs was an Italian restaurant that had $2 bud lights as an all day happy hour, by far the cheapest drinks besides having your own.  We went to Vegas 2 years ago and the cost from then to how has increased by 75%! Get the most out your trip.
The staff and dealers are rude. My husband and I got a fairly good deal to stay but the service we received and the overall quality of the casino was not worth the money we saved.
My mom and I were searching for hotels that we hadn't stayed at before.. that were "reasonably priced" and close to the Mandalay Bay Convention Center. I feel across Excalibur on Vegas.com and was surprised to see it was actually a 3 1/2 star rated hotel. So taking the above requirements into thought, we booked it.. . I don't know how this place is 3 1/2 stars. . It is extremely outdated. Needs some attention.. Thin Walls.. Kid-Friendly (which isn't necessarily a problem just something to consider). Shower only rooms (at least ours was). Not a lot of food options. Bare Minimum rooms. In other words, a high priced motel. . . Could be worse, but we won't stay here again.
I haven't stayed here for years but booked a cheap room for my friend and I to stay one night to see a concert. . . First off the line to check in is massive and it takes some time far cry from the diamond entrance at Caesars palace. Staff was friendly but they took some time and heads up this hotel charges a daily resort fee in addition to your room cost.. . Second when we got to our room there was an empty water bottle on the floor...gross it makes me wonder if the sheets are clean. The rooms and bathrooms are badly outdated and dirty looking. The towels also had a yellowish tint to them.. . This place reminds me of a motel 6 in a castle form. Be warned!
This place is disgusting. My coworkers warned me, My friends warned me, but I wanted to try it out. Never again will I think of staying here again. . . The towels are yellow and some are stained, the shower overflows, there was an empty bottle of water on the floor when we first entered the room. There are no mirrors in the rooms besides the one in the bathroom. . . The place smells like sweat covered in febreeze aroma cigarettes. Wow. This place is the worst hotel in Vegas. I do not recommend anyone to stay here.
This place was such a disappointment on so many levels.  . . I thought we had gotten a good deal because of the price and being on the strip but I should have paid a little more and gone elsewhere.   . . Our very first night we have dinner reservations at a restaurant Inside of the hotel and the blow dryer goes out numerous times on my girlfriend.  I call two times within a 45 minute period for a replacement and they do not show by the time we leave for dinner.  Very very disappointing to say the least.. . The other issue was how poorly the air circulation was on the main floor.   Regardless what entrance you go through the smell of cigarettes, shame and tears hits you and it's not a faint odor it's strong.  We visited other casinos and you could tell that the huge difference. . . We will never go back.   If your trying to save money do yourself a favor and spend a couple of extra bucks somewhere else.  Especially if your traveling with your girlfriend.
C'mon people--this is a cheap place to stay in Vegas. Let's try not to compare this place to others like Ceasar's Palace--you pay for that.. . We stayed here with our three kids. We were able to affordably stay here and get two adjoining rooms so we had space. We stayed in Tower 2. The rooms were clean and comfortable. It was very quiet and we were not disturbed by anyone walking in the halls late at night. The view was amazing out of our room, which faced the strip. We were able to stay here for $39/night on TripAdvisor. What a bargain. You do make some sacrifices for that though..... . The hotel does not have Wi-Fi. Granted I can use my 3G and don't really need it, but it's so common nowadays, they should offer it. There is no in-room coffee makers. There are no spare pillows, you'll have to call for them. No in room refrigerator. . . The only reason I docked a star was for the valet service. It was a joke. When we arrived on our first day the line for valet service was one hour long. It took the guys so long to get people out of their cars and moving. There was only one line too. It was very frustrating. On an alternate time, we showed up back at the hotel to valet park our car (which we had done for the prior 3 days) only to be greeted by a sign saying "VALET FULL". Really?!? I have never seen that, especially for current guests. The up side was that we realized that garage parking was not that bad and if we'd have known about it, we'd prefer to park our own car in the future. Go figure.. . TIP: Get VIP check in--otherwise the line for check in is over an hour long too. We purchased the VIP check in and got it done in 15 minutes.. . Overall a good visit.
This review is for the MLIFE department. I just called and spoke with your representative Angela, who was very rude and had a smirk attitude. She was reluctant to give me her name and refused to give out her last name; quote "Well I'm the only Angela here". I will be writing a negative review on yelp and only suggest you talk to your employees about having great customer service- not sub-par or mediocre. I am very disappointed and dissatisfied with mlife. I will not be giving out recommendations for your company.
Only stayed here one night before checking into our timeshare. The price was cheap ($50 total with resort fees) and on the other end of the strip than where we usually stay. . . We were in Tower 1 and the room was okay. One step above Circus Circus. I was disappointed but hey it's only one night and it was only $50 so suck it up. . . The checkin line looked scary long (think Disneyland line!) and took probably 30 or so minutes to get to the front. Thank goodness checkout was via email and done quickly. . . They didn't try to upgrade my room during checkin but you can tell they do since it's like a McDonald's counter with all their rooms pictured with the prices displayed. Honestly that looks cheap and I'm glad they didn't do that to me. We were only there for one night so I didn't care to upgrade. Enough about the room, I wouldn't stay there again or recommend unless your on a budget.. . The actual grounds are good for the kids, they enjoyed the castle and the arcade.
I seriously feel like this hotel doesn't get as much justice as it deserves. . . For starters, the staffs attention and care for their guests is excellent. I didn't have a single problem! All expectations were met. Everything we ever needed from them, was met at a great timely manner. . . - The rooms are very clean and big, and for the price, how could you genuinely complain? . - The casino is huge, and you really have a great time, the attention there is great as well. Our waitresses were on point on asking what we wanted and getting it back to us rather fast. . - The pools are nice, big and clean! While the drinks at the pool bar are rather pricey, they definitely use quality liquor and hello, it's Vegas.. What's cheap in Vegas? . - Food wise; you have PLENTY to chose from, and for all budgets!. - And last, but never least, it's in a great spot! You have the Luxor, MGM, New York New York and other great hotels near by. You're at walking distance from everything. Which, again, besides partying hard, you came to walk the strip! It's a good place to start it! . . Honestly, it's an amazing place, you should give it a shot! You get your bang for your buck and you definitely walk out feeling like royalty! ;)  Can't wait to come back :)
Great hotel and great price. Not sure why the reviews are so mixed. We stayed 3 night and had the contemporary king room in tower 2. It was very nice, spacious, clean and comfortable. The bathroom looked great and was big as well. The bed was very comfortable. We had an awesome view of the city and the mountains. The AC worked great and was easy to control and our room got cleaned daily. Absolutely no issues. I would definitely stay here again. My only complaints are lack of WiFi and the timeshare staff in the casino who we constantly had to ignore. Even though our room didn't have WiFi there was a long ethernet cable which worked great with the laptop we brought. The internet connection was fast and it was free.
First of all it is about expectations. If you want to stay in a five star hotel it will be nicer, but be prepared to pay the extra bucks. The Excalibur was inexpensive compared to any place, the pools were fantastic, one with waterfalls and a slide. The rooms were big and we had a great view of the strip. We loved being close to Mandalay Bay and NY, NY. The Food options were good for us. The furniture in the room and the decor were older and dated, but the beds were new and comfortable and the television was big--although the cable channels were limited--unless you like Friends and Full House which seemed to be on all the time.
