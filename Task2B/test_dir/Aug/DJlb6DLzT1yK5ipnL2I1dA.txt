Place was ok.  My boyfriend and I got in for free through a promoter.  Not sure if I'd be willing to pay for the cover.  It seems like it's in the basement.  Kind of cramped.  I was looking forward to seeing the waterfall but it really wasn't that impressive.  I was also looking forward to checking out the djs but really weren't impressed by them either.  Was thinking about buying an entry level dj controller from Pioneer or traktor but all I could see from the dancefloor was the MacBook.  I also wasn't too big of a fan of the top 40 music.  Might have had a better time at an edm club.  Ambiance seemed classy enough but I think there are better clubbing choices on the Strip.
I can only comment on my experience with Bottle Service but for me, that is important.  When people go to a nightclub and order Bottle Service for only two people and pay upwards of $1,000+, the expectations are going to be high.  . . That said, this nightclub never disappoints in that regard.  They are unique in that they have a two-person table area so you don't get surrounded by the 4-6 guys who are all splitting a bottle and trying to get trashed while scoring women who want free drinks.  There is one table in particular that is directly at the edge of the dance area and also is outside by the waterfall.  It's hard to get but it is worth it because you get the best of both worlds:  the beat and vibe of the club and the cooling effect of being outside.  The only other place that has that feel is Hyde at the Bellagio but the fountains there can drench you if it's windy when the window is open.  . . The last time we went, my fiance' and I were treated well by the servers and we also did what we usually do which is request a security guy be assigned near us to keep the bottle rats and club trash from putting their drinks on our table and hovering around.  We usually tip the security guy $100 right away and then it's basically like having a bodyguard there all night.  I remember one particular point during the night where one guy was just standing there and not moving plus bothering my fiance' while I was away from the table and the security guy grabbed him and basically picked him up and moved him away and said "don't come back here, ever."  That was classic.. . I would recommend going here if you are a couple and you want the full experience without some of the downsides of going to clubs and ordering bottle service.
Really enjoyed my time here with my best friend.  It was our birthday celebrations and we decided to do something we don't normally do and that is to go to a nightclub. We tend to enjoy more lounge/sports bars guests.  But I have to admit the music was nice and the feel felt really open and airy.  . . The real downside:  NO CHAIRS unless you pay for bottle service. For goodness sake, scatter a couple of high bar chairs around the area or to the back.  You don't have to provide bar tables, but chairs would do a lot of the women good, by getting them off their fee.  I understand that you are hoping to get people to buy the bottle service, but honestly a few chairs will not break your bank Tryst.  We were able to sit with the invite of a group of people who had bottle service, thank you very much Bryan, Chris, Andy and the rest of your group...you saved my feet!. . Redeeming quality, the staff was amazingly friendly!  Unlike Hakkassan, which I'll get to review in a minute.  The smiled.  They talked.  The security guys even walked us to the restroom when we asked for the location.  . . I'm probably getting too old to head back to a Nightclub.  I would recommend this place to people in their late 20's to early 40's.
Ive been here at this club 4 times and each time it was bottle service, more than 1500 each time. Some random girl was assaulted and her boyfriend decided to throw punches. Because we were not part of the confrontation we pushed our group aside. BUT because we pushed our group aside, so we can continue to enjoy our night, they decided we would b the easy group to blame. We were kicked out because we happened to b in the area, and it would b a quick fix liability wise.
After attending Tryst 4 times, including bottle service, I have to regrettable give a bad review.. The security is biased to a women's perception of events. My good friend who has participated in all 4 previous bottle services was interrogated and escorted out of tryst for being hit in the face. He was hit in the face! He did not provoke the situation, but was accidentally a bystanders. . Even the alleged victim stated my friend had not committed the violation. .  Sadly, he was escorted out because the casino follows procedure to prevent possible law suits from the victim.. . So, the Winn would rather offer subpar customer service that take a chance at possible lawsuit. No proof was ever shown. . . I regret to say that I will never partake in any Winn/Encore events or clubs.. . You have lost a loyal customer. Consider re-evaluating your protocol in situations like this.
This club was okay. We had a table and bottle service, outside of the dance floor/club area by the fountain. The way it was set up made it difficult to get in and out of table if we needed to use the restroom or wanted to dance. Thisis not the reason the club was just okay...The DJ playing on Saturday wasn't great, until the very last song (R Kelly "bump n grind"), as we were walking out haha. The worst part about the night was that the place was CRAWLING with very "thirsty" men. I mean we could barely walk through the club to the restroom without being cat called or groped. Obviously this isn't the club's fault, just a "beware for the ladies." Overall I wouldn't say this is the worst place I've been in Vegas, but not the best either. Give it a shot if you're staying in the Wynn or Encore and don't want to venture too far from your room.
