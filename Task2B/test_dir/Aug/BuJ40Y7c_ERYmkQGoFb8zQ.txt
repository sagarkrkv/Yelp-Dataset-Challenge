It's okay... The rooms have been renovated with ikea furniture ... And it's kinda smelly like musty...not a favorite.
The worst experience I have ever had in all the years I have come to vegas !!!   I ate at the beach cafe in the hotel and had a big plastic item in my garden salad . Called the manager to come see very nicely . She said "I will take care of this" she came back to the table n said there was nothing in the kitchen like that. Which I thought was very rude. I was a guest n my tooth is very loose from biting into it . She comped me my WATER.  The way the cafe management handled this situation was horrible . I will never recommend this hotel . The hotel management offered me a free night stay . But with that service there is no way I will ever return . Waiting for managers and no one was available , gave me the wrong paperwork . Had me consistently wait on sometime . I feel it was there problem and they should have handled it promptly and be sorry for what had just happend.
I got this hotel through hotwire. 4 stars. good price $200 for Saturday Sunday in July. the problem i had was the hotel room location. It is far from valet. It is far from parking. I have been to many hotels in Vegas. this one had the farthest parking from the hotel out of all of them. usually the valet is pretty close to the hotel rooms. This one was not the case. The parking is far also. I suggest you park in valet unless you want to walk far to the front door. I had to ask if there was another entrance, there is not. You walk, i kid you not at least 8 to 10 minutes to your room from the valet. Even further if you park your own car. Also check in took a long time. It took over an hour. It was Saturday. So it is understandable. But to only have 2 people working on a fight weekend on Saturday is crazy. I do like the free fresh chocolate cookies when you get there that you get. The area where the cookies are, are not even half way to the tower that has the hotel rooms. I finally get to my room and it is nice and clean but mines had a funny smell to it. I don't know what the deal was but it smelled like gym socks. I just dealt with it. The AC was super weak. Definitely was not that cold and i left it on the whole time on the lowest setting. It never got to that setting. I had a view of the airport. I didn't care as long as i cant hear planes im fine. The room was pretty shabby. WiFi or service to my cell phone is nonexistent but even trump towers and Wynn my phone struggles, i think its a Vegas thing in hotels. I had a little high hopes for a nice room. Funny thing is i stayed at circus circus Thursday Friday for free through my Vegas and that room was way better. Only thing i had to pay on that one was the resort fee. I thought in circus circus I would be slumming it and Tropicana would be worlds better. unfortunately it was not.
Great value and convenient location.  . Clean. Helpful and friendly staff. Quick check in/out. Nice fitness facility
I'm not a huge fan.. . I don't gamble and so this review is not for the casino. I am reviewing this as a Doubletree hotel.. . I came to Vegas for a conference, and decided to stay at a Hilton property.  If you are in that boat, and just want a nice Hilton hotel, I would not stay here.. . It smells terrible.  When you first walk in the front doors, you are affronted by (a) smoke, and (b) something that smells like womens' perfume being used to cover said smoke.. . The casino is really, really sad.  Lots and lots of elderly people addicted to gaming. At other casinos on the strip I saw lots of young folks -- definitely not here.  Average age probably about 60, and it just felt terrible to see so many fixed incomes going down the drain.. . I got a room back in the secondary tower (they have 2).  It was a good 10 minute walk from the main entrance. Which was annoying, because they didn't have any sort of exit to the street from that tower -- they make you walk all the way back through the smelly casino just to get out.. . Unfortunately like a number of Doubletrees (unlike the lower-priced Hamptons, ironically), the A/C doesn't allow the fan to be forced on.  I like to leave a fan running as background noise to help me sleep.  There was a fan in the bathroom that was perfect for this, but it also was configured to be force-connected to the light switch.  Evil.. . Restaurants were so-so, and expensive. There is a Starbucks onsite, which is worth a second star.  The other restaurants weren't anything to write home about.. . I had heard a lot about the amazing pool.  It was fine, but if it is the best on the strip, that would surprise me.
I don't have much to say about this hotel because I wouldn't stay here again.. . Hotel rooms-I stayed in the back tower and the walk to the tower was horrible. Walking through an entire casino with your luggage is the biggest pain in the ass, not to mention walking the bridge across the pool to get to the tower. Big thumbs down. Room was really nice, decor was nice, beds comfy, but bathroom was a motel 6 bathroom. Very old looking. Not what I would expect if owned by a hilton chain.. . Casino-casino was actually nice and fresh. Because it was newly renovated it smelled clean and didn't smell like a shit hole like some of the older casinos. Lots of options.. . Accommodations-pool was awesome, staff is nice, house keeping staff nice, but check in was a nightmare. Checked in at 2pm and line stretched to the casino. I was in the hilton honors check in and that line was in the casino as well. If it takes 30 mins for checkin, then you have already lost me as a customer that will not stay there again.
i love the tropicana one of the best hotels on the strip thank u for thefantastic time
I enjoy myself when I'm here. It's tons to do. This casino is very clean. The people who work here are extra friendly. I enjoy the slots most. I walk thru here on hot days to get away from the vegas heat. I always win a few coins so I just keep on coming back. The parking lot is not to far from the building so getting to ur car is easy as pie. . Sometimes when employees hold the door open for u they stand their with they hand out. So I give them 5. I'm not going to tip u because u held my door open get real. When a man see a lady coming he supposed to hold the door open. Pfff. He just stood their waiting on a tip well here is a tip ...tip yo ass away from me.
Since we only live about 3.5hrs from Vegas, we're frequent visitors in the Summer( when the rates are the cheapest).  My spouse and I despise everything about Vegas, the crowds, the gambling, the drinking, but we keep finding ourselves here.  Why?  Well, because we get such a good rate at The Trop and because we just plain like to relax.   Their Pool is amazing( except for the loud, loud music) and the customer service is also very good.  Oh and you get a free cookie : ). . . On our last trip( Sunday of Memorial Day weekened), we had an issue with a room in the club tower.  Their was a really bad sewage smell in the bathroom.  To give you the reader's digest version, it wasn't fixed the entire time we were there, even after being told it would be fixed.  Oh and we couldn't move rooms because their were no more rooms available.  Oh, wait, they told us we could move rooms on our very last night there.  Yeah, no thanks.  . .   I called the manager and was given a 50.00 dining credit for our next stay, all resort fees were waived and I was refunded for 1 night.  I was there for 1 night using Hilton Honor's points, so I just paid for 1 night.  We had a few issues at the pool because we were in on a reserved pool chair/2 drinks per person promotion.  However, we weren't allowed to bring in club soda( we don't drink alcohol) from a bar inside to the pool. . .  The outside bar didn't serve club soda either( does that make any sense?).  So, we were told we would have a bar credit for our next stay.  Also, we were given a ridiculously cheap rate for our next stay and no resort fees once again.  We're going to Vegas next week ( Whoop, Whoop).  . . We haven't eaten at any of the restaurants, except for Starbucks.  Another reviewer said the breakfast sandwiches are microwaved.  That is not true.  They have a convection oven so no soggy bread.   . . Always check Groupon before you go, I've seen deals for the Italian restaurant Bacio.  My one issue is the parking garage.  The garage is NOT connected to the hotel so you have to walk outside to get back to the hotel.  Its ok in the winter, but HOT in the summer.  . . I always request a fridge because I have medication that needs to be kept cold.  Never a problem.  . . The rooms are large and newly decorated.  I don't believe that the A/C is actually what is says on the thermostat.  It never feels that cool.   . . The resort fee is negotiable.  If you don't want to use the gym, just pay the 10.00 for WiFi.  That is what I plan to do the next time I have to pay the fee.
I stayed in this hotel in July 2014. Like most LV casinos, it reeks of cigarette smoke, but we got the only room with 2 beds available in LV  that I could find that wasn't a $2000 suite. . . We arrived at 2am and checked in after being told that the smoking floor "wasn't that smokey and almost none of our guests smoke in their rooms. But if it does smell we can run the ozone machine" Well wouldn't you just know that upon stepping out of the elevator our eyes were burning from the smoke. Our room was also smokey and the windows only open a crack. I tried to ignore it until I started stepping in puddles on the carpet. This is LV and who knows WHAT these puddles are so I called the front desk thoroughly disgusted. I also mentioned the smoke - Get this, the ozone machine takes 2 hours to run and you have to leave the room. At this point its 3am. It started to seem like one bad joke.. . I could not sleep as I felt like I was choking all night. A few hours later I was glad to get out of there. My experience might have been different had I not been in a smoking room with mystery puddles, but I still will not stay here again.
First let me cover some of the pros before I get to the cons. The room I'm in is a decent size. The bed is extremely comfortable and the flat screen TV is a nice addition. The pool that is open is nicely set up with a swim up black jack table and other games for the family. . It also has a nice bar with plenty of TVs and the music that was playing was ok.  The casino area uses the limited space very well. The Sports book area is absolutely awesome. The biggest pro would be the location. It's next to and across the street from several other nice hotel/casinos which makes it very easy to escape from this place. . Now, for the cons, the "New" Tropicana has obviously been remodeled. But, it's still very old. For starters, every time I showered the water leaked from the tub causing a large puddle in the carpet. I pointed it out to house keeping and theirfix was to stuff a towel along the bottom of the shower. All this did was slow the process of the carpet getting wet. And, while showering the water temperature would constantly change. Almost reminiscent of being a kid and flushing the toilet so your sibling gets ice cold water during their shower. . . Even worse, the pipes in this place are so old the smell of sewage emits from my toilet. This causes my entire room to smell as if it's on a septic tank. To get away from this I decided to go down to the pool area. While at the pool when the wind shifted I could smell the sewage again. Just to make sure it wasn't just me I asked some other guests and they smelled it too. A couple even had the same problem as me with the smell coming from the toilet in their room. . I would definitely not recommend staying at The New Tropicana. There's plenty of other nicely priced Hotel/Casinos to stay at that are not trying to cover up their age with a fresh coat of paint.  If you do decide to stay and try it our for yourself, don't say I didn't warn you!! Lol
This review is for the pool since we didn't stay at the hotel.. . Short version: Surprisingly affordable with very friendly service. Added bonus: the laid back feeling allows you to relax rather than feeling like you NEED to party.... With the small exception of the "neighbors" over the fence.. . Longer version: Went here for a stop on our Bachelorette whirlwind weekend extravaganza. I'm a "Babe on a Budget" so I was not about to pay $400 for a daybed at some of the other hotel pools on the Strip. The Tropicana Pool absolutely fit my budget: 1 daybed ($100) + 1 cabana ($100) + $150 food/beverage minimum divided between 8 girls is surprisingly affordable. With tip, I ended up paying about $55 which is awesome for Vegas! The only thing that takes away from the full 5 star rating is the fact that we were stationed right over the fence from a pretty techno-rific dance-party-pool-party. At first the bumpin' music fueled our fun... But after 3 hours of hearing what sounded like the same song over and over again, it kind of took away a little bit from the more relaxing fun we were having. . . Overall, we recommend it! If you can, try to reserve a daybed on the grass area away from the techno dance party fence.
Xposed Saturgays Pool Party Review Only. . . Pros:. - Clean and well-kept. - Good music selection. - Easy booking and check-in process. - Good turn out and crowd. . Cons:. - Hidden Fees - Beware food/bev min is based on subtotal only. Does not include tax, auto gratuity, and a random service fee. A $400 food/bev subtotal comes out to roughly $525.  . - Forgetful service - half of items ordered over the course of the day were forgotten and server had to be reminded next time they came by. - No separate checks - servers can only split bills across 2 payments. - Sub-par food - edible, but not delicious
Definitely better than what it used to be. It's been remodeled and now part of the Hilton family. It's nicer inside. There were minor things in the room that weren't finished well that I think they should've done better on so it doesn't look like they did a cheap job. The gym hours are wack. They close a 7pm. The back tower is super far from the front desk and there's no back entrance. So it's always a long walk to the casinos. I would stay there again if the price continues to be right.
This was a great room at a great price. We stayed on Saturday and Sunday night at an average rate of $72 per night on the first weekend in August. This is not the classiest or biggest casino/ hotel on the strip, but the amenities are perfect. They have decent gambling, great pools, a few nice dining options, and a comedy club. The comedy club was perfect for our party of 15. The bars in the casino serve good drinks at a good price and the rooms are comfortable for the after party. The location is perfect. We were at the MGM, Excalibur, Luxor, New York NY, and Mandalay Bay in minutes. Have fun!
Fair price, decent location, beautiful pools. Sort of basic rooms, no refrigerator, great shower/large tub. Rooms are kind of far to walk to so don't forget anything from your room while heading to the casino, it's a ways back there. Overall I would stay again, nice beds and quiet rooms.
How disappointing. I have no expectations or high standards, but to have to wait 90 minutes for a room, then well after check in time to stand at the front desk with a woman for another THIRTY minutes while she's on hold to housekeeping to see if our room was ready is silly.  Then the next morning we leave the room at 8am for the day and get home at 5pm and housekeeping is nowhere to be seen.  Room never made up and no one ever came.  Top it off with a nicely remodeled bungalow room with no fridge and NO FUNCTIONING AC IN AUGUST?   Epic fail.  Don't stay here.
My husband and I stayed at the Tropicana while attending a convention in Las Vegas.  It's the third time we've stayed there and we love it!  They were in the middle of their remodel the last time and the transformation we saw on this trip was remarkable!  The customer service is always outstanding and the rooms are very modern, comfortable and clean.  We upgraded to a suit on this trip and it was gorgeous!   It was the perfect place to unwind after a long day of work.  We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great place to stay on the Las Vegas strip.
