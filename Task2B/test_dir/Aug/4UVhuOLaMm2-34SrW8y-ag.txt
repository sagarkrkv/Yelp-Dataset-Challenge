Food was alright but the service wasn't all that great. Waitresses looked a little confused of what was going on. My group waited a really long time for our last two orders to the point where we had to cancel one of them. The extra charge for refills on drinks was kind of unnecessary. My advice would be just to read what's on the walls first and then order because the menu isn't updated. The experience overall didn't really meet my group's expectations. And I didn't find out about their "shutdowns" until after I left, I'd google that btw.
This place is definitely a gem. It's a small restaurant hidden in an Asian plaza. There's not too much seating but it's worth the wait. The pricing is decent, I know how sushi can get pretty pricey. Their seaweed salad was light and fresh. I enjoyed their Gyoza and spider roll. I also tried their grapefruit soju?  - they give you fresh grapefruit to squeeze into your soju. Yummy! If I lived in LV I would definitely be a regular! I'll just be sure to visit again the next time I'm in town.
A must stop when I come to Vegas. A large menu that extends to many items also listed on their  wall. . . I recommend going to dinner and getting a reservation. It gets quite busy here and it's not that large.. . Tonight we tried their chicken cutlet and drumstick, beef tongue with mushrooms, gomae, miso cod, unagi karage tempura and jalapeno fried rice. If you are into spicy food, definitely get the jalapeno fried rice. . . Usually I'd order the yellowtail tar tar and hamachi carpaccio but wanted to try diff things tonight. These are a must for first timers :)
Ichiza is one of those places you go to after you've spent the entire day eating at fancy restaurants on the strip and have gambled away some more dough and now need some comfort food that won't break the bank. . . It is an izakaya located on the second floor of a strip mall near Chinatown in LV and it can get crowded late at night. . . I've been twice now and had their udon, ramen, albacore sashimi, karaage, honey toast, and most recently discovered that their banana crepe dessert is really good. . . The honey toast was better the first time I came and I think one try is enough. Other than that the udon was fine, the ramen was good, and the sashimi was okay as well.. . When I visited they had a large menu advertising their cold noodle specials that ran throughout August to combat the desert heat. . . One thing about this place is that late at night when they're swamped, the service takes awhile. Just something to keep in mind.
I haven't tried everything but so far everything is delicious.. . I recommend ordering fried baby octopus, skewered beef tongue, wagyu beef carpaccio, tartar yellow tail, Dx ramen...this is all I can remember.  It's all yummy in my tummy.  . . Gets really crowded, this place is small so be ready to wait in line or come right at 5pm on a weekday when they open.
Try something different every time, but always get a order of Eel Kakiage Tempura Rolls. They are smack-yo-mama good. The parking situation is terrible on weekends, but I can't fault them for that considering they're on the second floor of a busy building. Plan on parking across the street by the Marine bar--DON'T park next door at the Chinatown Plaza or you'll get hassled by a rent-a-cop.
If there were a 6-star rating, I'd give them 6! Wow! Everything we had was simply amazing. Beef, yellowtail, even tofu. This place has definitely made it into the "must hit" list each and every time we go to Vegas (3-4 times per year). Cannot wait!!!
This place came highly recommended by many.  It is more traditional Japanese food however the food was not good to me at all.  Service was lagging. My taste buds just didn't mesh with the place.  Cod still had the bones in it, Honey toast wasn't as good as I expected.  Go downstairs to Kaya.
Great place, Tapas and good dessert, try the pork Udon stir fry dish but deff try the Honey Toast with ice cream! Its sooo good
This delectable restaurant is a must every time I'm in town.  I have it bookmarked & I tell my friends about it.  If you don't know what to order, the daily specials is a great start.  Also, look at the posted items above the sushi bar for "new items."  I often try those.  Price wise, this place is great!  Delicious sushi at fantastic prices.
