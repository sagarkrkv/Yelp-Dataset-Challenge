Chose BLT because the line at Carnegie Deli was so long. I'm Glad I did! I had the burger with smoked Gouda cheese sauce was wonderful. The fat fries are seasoned wedges. Very good. Good service as well.
This place was a-okay. My friends and I dropped by this place for a quick bite before our Cirque du Soleil "Love" show. The Kobe sliders were decent, but the meat was a bit on the dry side. Maybe more sauce would have made them better and mask the dryness a bit. The waffle bites were okay as well. They consisted of criss-cut fries with cheese, bacon bits, jalepenos, and sour cream on top. . . The guys also order Jameson whiskey with pickle back.  We recently discovered this combination when the guys were in New York. It sounds weird but is actually refreshing. Our server had never heard of this before and gave it as a mixed drink of Jameson and pickle juice all in one cup. He was nice and polite about getting the drinks fixed when we explained that we wanted shots of Jameson with pickle juice as chasers. The service was a little slow, but at least they fixed the drinks without any hassle.
Stopped by BLT for lunch after taking the kids to the Gardens.  Wait for lunch was only about 5 minutes.. . Service was mediocre, not good but not terrible.  The waitress' shirt said "Tip the waiters, not the cows."  I chuckled because she more closely resembled the latter, but I'll stop there so as to not be cruel.   We waited about 10 minutes before a drink order.  Honestly the poor lady didn't seem like she wanted to be there and wasn't very eager to serve us.. . Food took about 15 minutes.  We got the BLT burgers.  Nice sized burgers.  Although we ordered them medium they came medium rare.  Not a big deal to us but some people may be displeased.  Order medium well if you want a medium.  Adding fries and a Coke adds $7 (!!!) to your $14-20 burger.  Rip off for sure..  But that's Vegas.. . Overall, not a memorable place but not horrible either.  Typical overhyped tourist trap that the Strip is known for.. . I posted a video panorama of the joint. If you appreciate the pure majesty of a Spielberg type video production, don't miss it.  ;)
Chicken burger with pesto, cheese, onion, sun dried tomato was awesome.  As was horseradish cole slaw!   Buffalo fries are amazing.
Awesome burger, big and juicy. Expensive though if you want fries and shake. Friendly waiter. Watched the Mirage volcano show right after it
This place has good burgers on the strip. I would go back next time in vegas. My wagu burger was tasty and the meat was of good quality. I found on that night my fries good but on the cold side. The onion rings was really good. The plus size is that it is not overly expensive. The service is just okay (vegas style).
Nice place. Service wasnt quick but wasnt slow, which was fine since the place was busy. I split a burger with my wife and had a shake for $27. Food was great.
Decent, not mind-blowing burger.  A little expensive for what you get.  Wait was short, though it's in the Mirage casino which tends to get busy so we might've just lucked out.  Nothing particularly special, but if you're hungry and have a burger craving, this is a good place to go.
Wow, what happened to this place??? Walked up to the podium to get a table and the 2 hostesses finished there conversation after a few seconds and the. just looked up at us...no "hello" or "How can I help you"??? Requested a table for 2 and they walked us to the table and just walked away without a word. It was like they were mad at us for interrupting their conversation. . . While looking over the menu we watched what appeared to be the manager behind the bar us her bare hands to fix her hair, eat something and then go straight to makeing drinks touching straws and garnishes...ewww. Decided to just have water.. . After about 10 minutes of people walking by an  not acknowledging us we asked a busser for a waiter. Our waiter, who passed by us 3-4 times without saying a word, rolled his eyes when approached by the busser. . . We walked out and went to Carnegie Deli...best choice of the day!!!
Overpriced for what you get. The burger was dry and not worth $15. I could get a better burger at Smash Burger for $8. I ordered the waffle fries and they were over cooked and seemed like they sat for awhile before being served to me. Also tried the marshmallow shake and it just tasted like vanilla ice cream, also not worth the $8. I would not return here. Save yourself from being disappointed and don't go here.
One of the best burger joints in vegas.   All of the food I have ever eaten there has been great.  The chicken wings are huge and cooked perfectly.  I've had 4 burgers here on different occasions: cowboy, Pimental, salmon, turkey.  All were excellent. . . . Management rocks here!
It was our first night at the Mirage, we were super hungry after having both a delayed flight and delayed shuttle, and we were eager to use our $50 room credit. That said, this hit the spot for us. I got the BLT burger with sweet potato fries, and the boyfriend got the Kobe slider trio with buffalo fries. I learned a very important lesson here: always ask how big the burgers are, especially in Vegas. At home, I'm used to medium sized "big" burgers and and expecting an average size every time, so I forgot that everything is bigger in Vegas, literally. Welp. My burger was so high that it would've required two mouth-lengths (for lack of a better term) to even bite into all at once. That's not to say that it wasn't good. It was delicious, just very intimidating and I couldn't even finish it all. And with the prices that were charged, I felt very badly for not finishing the whole burger. The sweet potato fries were good (as always, I am a sweet potato fiend). I did not try my boyfriend's kobe slider trio (in hindsight, I should've gone with that instead - much more manageable portions), but we did share the buffalo fries and OMG! Amazing, amazing, amazing! I am daydreaming about them right now. Buffalo wing sauce, blue cheese dressing (mmm, mmm), and (I think) chopped green onions to top them off - just simply wonderful. I would and could make a meal out of just those. So, to recap - the food is great, the service was friendly and not overbearing, but the prices are a little shocking. Luckily, we had our dining credit and paid the difference, so that took some of the sting out. I think we'd go back again, now that I know what their portion sizing is like and what their pricing is like.
Don't order your burger medium. Or medium well. Medium was cold and RED inside. Our order took 30 minutes to get to our table. My wife ordered hers Medium-Well. The server said ' it took 30 minutes because you ordered this one Medium-Well. What??? Good thing she didn't say we'll done!. Our Sweet Potato fries were burnt.. Our server Diego was very nice and apologetic. The manager,  who removed one burger from our bill never apologized only gave several ridiculous excuses.. Never again.
This place makes really good burgers and their buffalo fries are pretty darn appetizing... But, I would come here solely on my craving for their PB & J milkshake called "The Lunch Box". Vanilla ice cream, grape jelly, peanut butter, with whip cream on top. Boom! Yes, yes, yes & YES!
The best burgers we've had in a while! Hands down my wife doesn't like to eat meat but wrapped her hands around on of the Tex-Mex burgers and all she could say was awesome. Great service for it being a Friday night we walked right into a booth.
You know when you go to Vegas you're expecting pretty terrible service be it hotel or restaurant, but I had hopes for this place.  Was excited when I got here, but when I ordered a burger with cheddar an egg and avocado and got a chicken sandwich with bacon and sundried tomatoes I assumed it was a mixup.  They refired my meal and the next time I got a burger with bacon and onions.  The waiter chucked the whole thing off and I just took off the toppings I didn't want or like and ate the plain burger because we were late for a show.  But to charge me for all the incorrect toppings at the end - AND the toppings I never even got!?
