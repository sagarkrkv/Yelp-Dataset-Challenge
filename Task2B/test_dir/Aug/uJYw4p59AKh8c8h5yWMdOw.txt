Nice hotel... Shops are great. However customer service is horrible! Rooms smell horrible, room was dirty, gross sink that reeked of vomit. When we arrived there were dishes outside... Asked for towels twice and never got them. Very careless customer service! Never staying here again!!!!!!!!
Love the Hotel, Casino and It's location but I like to spend time during the day by the pool.The only way you can get service is to pay for a place by the pool. No one came by to serve drinks. I had to wait in a lineup. I quickly clued in that  it's better to by a bucket of beer on ice , this way I don't have to keep going back in line. I guess I'm comparing this to Caesars pool where the hostess was by quite frequently.. If you are not a pool person, this a descent hotel. If you want a nice pool with great service try somewhere else like Caesars.
BED BUGS!!! Just checked out of the planet Hollywood hotel and as I speak I have been standing in the lobby for about an hour waiting for a "manager" I missed my flight my luggage has bed bugs and they seem to not care. this shitty place deserves this review. If you stay at planet Hollywood have fun trying to wear a tank top with red bed bug bites all over your arm.
This review is for the Casino: . . PH is very similar to it's neighbors.  It's in a really good location right in the middle of the strip and is really close to plenty of restaurants and shopping.  Burgr is extremely busy, so I missed out eating there twice.  Earl of Sandwich is a life saver.  . . Other than that, PH has plenty of ways to gamble and have a blast.
Okay so, this was the last leg of my Anniversary tour. Got upgraded to a suite.  Oh yeah.. And, the casino musta read my last review because my number on roulette hit a few times.  Thus, increased a star....  Boom
TL;DR version:  Stay at PH.  . . I'm a huge fan of PH, and come here to eat and gamble even when I'm not staying here.  The hardest part for me is deciding where to eat, because every offering is fantastic. Pampas, Todai, Spice Market, BURGR, Pink's, Pin Up, Earl of Sandwich, Cheeseburger, Ocean One, and on, and on, and on. No where else in Vegas does one hotel/casino have so  many great places to eat under one roof.. . The rooms are large enough and very comfortable.  We had a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the Strip.  As with most places in Vegas, the room could use a few more conveniently located outlets, so I didn't have to charge my phone on the floor in the only available outlet.  The bathroom was big and spacious, and had a big soaking tub, separate shower, and separate room with the toilet.  Overall, very well thought out.. . PH is located in the best possible spot on the Strip, with every place I like to play cards being an easy walk in one direction or the other.  As for the poker room, I will play 1/2 at PH, but since they don't offer a limit game for my wife, we go elsewhere when she's in the mood.  The slot machines were great some days and awful other days.  With respect to payouts, it was as though they swung wildly from Scrooge McDuck to drunk-bachelor-at-a-strip-club.  Gotta be a science to it I don't understand, but if I could time it just once.... . Maria at Spice Market is great.  Thanks for the mimosas!. . Love the music at night.. . Great atmosphere all the time.. . Two ABC stores on the miracle mile.  Awesome.. . Great shops on the miracle mile.. . Only problem I had there: . - I don't care how full your valet parking is, you should always find room for cars of hotel guests.  Period.  No excuses.
Casino Rating only (notes from 8/3/14). Jacks or Better 8/5 ok not great. BJ 3/2 on 8 deck shoe, surrender, DOA, DAS. Dealers in lingerie was 6/5 21 (not what I call blackjack). Craps 3-4-5x odds. Double Zero (american style) roulette (the worst kind). Great scenery in the party pit.. . One thing i did not like was the Cashier Cage is VERY hard to spot
Our stay here was pretty pleasant except for no mini fridge---not sure why because I have stayed at average hotels elsewhere and even they have mini fridges. Anyway I would have given the five stars except for a random "engineer" guy who kept knocking on our door while my bf and I were in the room. He proceeded to use a key and opened our door even though was replied to let him know we were inside. He then asks if we ordered a television? I mean I wouldn't have felt uncomfortable but the guy opened the door without asking. Overall the experience was good, very comfortable bed and they asked us if we wanted to upgrade to a room with a better view. It was a great view right across from the Bellagio fountains. The room was decently clean and the bathtub was nice as well. I liked that they restock the little shower gels and soap bars. They did not change our sheets but they did make the beds over. Staying here was good we were in the center of everything and had the mall right below for whatever we needed. We also enjoyed food at Gordon Ramsays Burgr downstairs. I would stay here again!
Customer service???? Ph does not know the how to treat their guests! If u have the option...do not stay here! Pay the extra amount for another hotel.....how is this place still running is my question? Brent is an ass...not very accommodating...the manager for the night is just the same...her name is lupe....we booked through another website n then called ph to get our rate matched n then...they do not even know what they r talking about here.....dumb people that work here.....they messed up n do not even give a discount or care that they gave away our 2 queen rooms...like I said do not stay here give money to another place!!! Stay away!
We have lived in Vegas for over 20 years and we do staycations all the time. I can say this is not a hotel I would recommend. The mall is great, great stores and food. The atmosphere is a very fun. . . The service left quite a bit to be desired though. Day 1, no in room refrigerator and when I went to the ice machine on our floor, it was out of ice. I called the front desk to see if someone could bring up a bucket of ice. The reply? "Well, they will charge you because you could just take the elevator to another floor." Maybe I've just been here too long and take customer service for granted but that seems just crazy to me. . . Day 2, we woke up (a little rough around the edges) and started to look around for a coffee maker....none? Wow! We call the front desk and get a similar response, basically "no." Even a Holiday Inn comes with a coffee maker, sheesh. We look up room service for coffee, $9.00 for half a pot, not out of the ordinary for room service. They bring the coffee and it's $17.00. There is a 19% service fee and a $5.00 per order fee. I'm all about charging what you can but the actual cost should be more prominent than a 3 point font at the bottom of the page. This just seems akin to selling cheap airline tickets and charging me $25.00 to bring a suitcase. If you have to hide your charges, then you should probably rethink your business model or expect to be short lived.
It's good enough.  I love the location and the casino floor. Earl of Sandwich is in here so you can eat that every night after going out like we do. Nothing like a 4 am sandwich. I also like how there aee Walgreens, Mcdonalds, and all of the Miracle Mile shops attached to it. The pool is pretty great too. They have the pleasure pool for adults and the family pool. Pleasure Pool is fun with some good tunes. The 3 stars is solely for the rooms. I just expect something more. I've stayed here 3 times and the memorabilia is awesome but the actual accomodations are a little weird. I've seen dirty sheets, non functioning ACs, messed up furniture and more. That being said, it's an awesome location. you are near some great clubs in other hotels and great food as well. If you can get a good deal, stay here!
WTF?! Use this hotel if there is nothing else left on the strip. Their customer service is beyond horrible! Even the manager has the audacity to talk down to us. We booked 2 rooms with 2 queen beds and the only thing they had available was 2 1 king beds. He said the 2 queens are a request and not guaranteed. Then why did I pay for 2? Whatever. In the end we end up with the kings. In our room we found a cricket, a cockroach and a rollipolli. Where are these animals coming from? In the end I would not recommend using this hotel because their customer service is the worst I've ever experienced and the rooms are dirty!
I stayed here for my 21st birthday and I loved it! The location is great. Right across from the cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Ceacer Palace and next to the Eiffel Tower it's awesome. The hotel was pretty clean, clean comfy beds with flat screen TVs. Not bad. Totally recommended. Pretty affordable too
First time here was pretty hesitant from reading the reviews but my stay was perfect we stayed on the 26th floor room and restroom was spacious modern and clean overall stay was nice ordered room service took 30 min housekeepers were attentive and punctual everyone was super nice... To top it off it has a awesome location !!. Only let down was  the pool nothing impressive compared to other ones
My husband and I took a 3 day trip to Vegas to get away after all the stresses of late. We had two comped nights from Caesar's Entertainment because of a bad experience at the Flamingo. One of the things that immediately impressed me, is that unlike a lot of the other places that we have stayed, there was actually enough people to check in the amount of guests in line. Susan checked us in, and was very patient, and helpful trying to figure out the situation with the comped room. The person who did the reservations forgot to put in their comp code and Susan had to be on the phone for about 25 minutes to straighten it out. Because of the wait, Susan gave us a free upgrade to the 50th floor, in one of their VIP rooms. . . The room, was amazing! We got the "True Lies" room, and it was decorated with memorabilia from the film. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom had a separate shower and a very deep tub, as well as a TV (which pleased the husband). Our view was amazing. We could see the Aria and Cosmopolitan all lit up, and if we sat in the window seat we could watch the fountains at the Bellagio going off.. . Our service the entire time was great. I plan to stick to Planet Hollywood and Monte Carlo from now on for my vacation plans. We spend most of our time in the shops at Miracle Mile anyway, so being right there close to them was convenient. There are tons of places to eat within the resort and lots of shopping options. I would say this is one of the better places to stay for food and shopping options.. . The only downfall to this hotel is their pools. The pools are disappointing. There are two, but the seating around the pools is only cabanas or sitting on the ground. They have a HUGE open area with lots of lounge chairs in a big section between the two pools, but you don't have a view of anything, and in August it's HOT!!! You want to sit by the pool. And it's kind of lame if you want to sit or lay down and still be where the action is. . . Overall, this was my best Vegas hotel stay ever. I will for sure be back. . . . Stayed August 2014
I have been to Vegas a number of times and my review is based on my typical experience... I've stayed at PH before and my experience then was terrific. That was about four years ago. This time however... Was gross. . . First, we got to our room and noticed a faint smell. We unpacked and as we did so, I stepped in a wet spot on the floor. I quickly put my shoes back on and decided that not even socks were OK in this room. After we opened the bathroom doors, the smell got stronger... And, then even stronger a few hours later. . . Later that evening. I sat on the edge of the bed, and the mattress fell through the frame. Looking around, I noticed that the furniture was pretty beat up as well. . . We were only there two nights and it was on the second night that we decided to turn on the TV... Nope it didn't work. . . BTW-Did I mention, this was an upgraded room? I think not. It was pretty small, and by no means anything like any upgraded room I've stayed in before. . . Food... Well, we opted to eat out most of the time, but on our second night we decided to try Burgr... My burger was salty and chared. The soda was flat and they had no means of replacing it with something drinkable. . . Stay at PH at your own risk.
This was our first Vegas trip together, for my husband and I. Decided to stay here because my mom recomended it. . Pros:. We found it super fast. Very great location right on the strip. . the overall appearance was nice.. Check-in time was fast. They had many people working. . We got a room in the 27th floor. Over looking the pool & strip (really nice) . Room was spacious & clean. . . Cons:. The parking! Ughh, probably it was our fault by not knowing. But we took like an 1hr to find parking and when we found one, we didnt know where to go. . (Who knew you had to walk the mile shops before getting to the resort and casino?WE didnt!) such a hassle. . & the room furniture was a little outdated  . & not enough sitting area around pool. We had to keep an eye out all the time to get a chair by the pool. . . . Overall, our 2 night stay was good. Will stay here in future (now that we know the parking situation, it should go more smoothly, right?)
If u don't want to be robbed. Don't come here. They lack of security. I had a guy run off with my wallet that had $1000 in it. I was not pickpocket but I was playing at the craps machine with my bag in front of me. My friend chased the guy and the thief thew my wallet back and got away with $100. (Thank goodness!) I was really disappointed that security didn't help to chase and only showed up 5 mins after. . . That's not all. Their dealers were rude to me. Not all but it just takes 1 bad apple to change your opinion. I was rather insulted when they told me my Singapore National ID looked fake after I even after I showed them my NY ID. I'm 24 and look young so I get carded everywhere in Vegas but this was the worst. Just because you haven't seen the ID before doesn't give you the right to say it's fake. Teach your dealers manners please. Really spoilt the mood the gamble and have a good time. . . Our hotel room was nice but NEVER coming back here again mainly because Planet Hollywood did not provide good security for all players and don't know how to treat their guest.. . P.S The seats in the casino gave me a rash on the back of my thigh.
For as much as this room cost, it's awful.  The furniture is dinged up and dingy, the TV is ancient and without inputs, and the toilet runs constantly.  I won't be staying here again.
Let me begin by saying that I had a great stay here and enjoyed the hotel and casino.  My beef is with the hotel/billing.  I stayed here during my wedding and honeymoon.   My sister-in-law paid for our room as a wedding gift.  She called weeks in advance, gave her credit card information, and booked our room.  When we arrived, we were required to leave our credit card to check in.  We explained the scenario to the clerk and were assured that this would be no problem. Upon checking out at the end of our stay, I was informed that all but the room deposit would be charged to MY card.  When I explained the error to them, they were unsympathetic and basically told me to go fly a kite.  I had my sister-in-law call while I was standing there.  They said the only way to resolve this was for the hotel to email her a credit card authorization and have her return it.  She did this.  It is now 3 weeks later and my credit card has not been credited nor my sister-in-law's debited.  I called the billing department and was told she had to call the billing department and that they had no notes regarding anything that had happened.  It's a darn shame that a lovely vacation had to turn ugly over such a simple fix.  Shame shame Planet Hollywood
BEWARE. We left six Britney Spears tickets on the desk of our room before we left for dinner two hours before the concert. When we came back our tickets were gone. Before we left housekeeping came to . clean our room.. . When we got back to our room are tickets were gone. We tried everything to get them on our phones went to the box office no help because we got them from stub hub.. . I advised front desk of what had happened told them I think housekeeping may have thrown them away. All they did was point me to their lobby computers to print new tickets but after paying for it their printers did not work. . . I complained to the manager and the manager said that she spoke with housekeeping and housekeeping did not throw any papers away. Finally we were able to get our tickets from stub hub on our phones and we saw 27 minutes of an hour and a half show which we spent over $1200 to watch.. . Right after the show the manager told us they found our tickets which housekeeping did have. In fact she smiled at when while she showed me our tickets. When I asked them to compensate us for the loss of the show, for our rooms or for anything, they refuse to help us whatsoever. They were uncooperative, they were unhelpful, they were rude. I was told the only way they can help me is by filing a report. I do want to get anyone in trouble I just want them took acknowledge what they did to us and to compensate us for the loss of this weekend and the show. . . However they refuse to do anything other then to call security to our room to investigate and write a report. This place sucks do not stay here they steal from you, lie, and do nothing to help you out.
Location- 5 Stars.  Walking distance to everything we needed to do.. . Front Desk- 1 Star.  First of all, you're the front man/woman of your hotel.  Your attitude must be welcoming. Second, it's non of your damn business who's in the room with me and what their propose is!! WTF!! . . Room- 2 Stars.  The room was dark.  There's a desk but no light near the desk area and some of the light fixtures were not in working order.  The movie motif was cool but the room looked very dated.  The bathroom is in much need of an upgrade!!!  I wanted to shower with slippers on!  There was calcium build up on the shower head.  Terrible water pressure.  Build up around the sink handles.  Our sink also backed up when we used the tub.  The location of our room was terrible!!!  All day and night long I could hear either the elevator going up and down or a washing machine running 24/7.. . Valet- 4 Stars.  Welcoming and helpful upon arrival.. . Bell Service- 5 Stars upon arrival!! 1 Star when we departed!. . Casino- 3 Stars.  Seemed like all the same machines.  Not much variety.  No wonder it was fairly empty.. . Cocktail Hostess- 0 Stars if possible.  She took our drink order and vanished into thin air!!  Must've been David Copperfield!. . Restaurants- 3 Stars for Pin Up Pizza.  Great prices and decent pizza.  My daughter rated BurGR 3 Stars.  The food was tasty but the service was lacking.. . You get what you pay for and since I booked a 2 night stay for $205 maybe I shouldn't complain?
We stayed Friday-Monday at planet hollywood. Checked in Friday at 5:30 pm ..no wait and I let front desk know I did not want charging privileges so that they would not hold a deposit on my credit card ..this was no problem . Our room was on the 23rd floor ..it was clean and comfortable but no view, but we only paid 300 for the 3 nights so no biggie. Room service was great, fast and huge portions ..I recommend the prime rib! . Would definitely stay here again.
I would definitely stay here again. We stayed here in July 2014, had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and Eiiffel Tower, nice sized rooms and beds. We also won on craps here too, I love the fact they have 2 Starbucks plus the Miracle Mile shops here.
There are only 2 pros to this hotel - location and shopping. With that being said.... . Where do I begin? I have had PH on my list of hotels to stay when visiting Las Vegas and I was looking forward to staying there. The pictures on line of course, appeared to be well appointed and contemporary. What the hotel offered was contemporary but worn and torn! . . The lobby is very misleading. It was clean, vibrant and colorful, which made me excited to see my room. As soon as I hit the elevator and saw the doors close, I knew something was very off. There were scuff marks on the walls of the elevator, scratches and initial carvings in the metal and the doors looked like they had been kicked several times with scratches and dents. Approaching my room, the hall way carpet was torn and stained in several spots, unravelling and bubbled in others. I came to discover during my stay that all the elevators were beat up.. . I got to my room, the Resort Room, and it was covered in a layer of dust everywhere. There were spill marks on the desk with splatter marks down the leg of it. By that point I was uneasy and checked the bed for bed bugs! I opened the closet to hang my clothes and noticed the wood was chipped all throughout the bureau, with the worst of it where the ironing board was placed. One of the drawers didn't open properly.. I called to have the room cleaned and dusted. Throughout my entire stay of 3 days, no one cleaned the spill marks down the table leg. There were chips in the wood on the tables as well.. . The pool - another disaster! PH charges $118 for reserved day beds. That would be great if the daybeds weren't all stained with mysterious spots, some of them questionably large and obvious. Regular deck chairs are wobbly, with support bands busted off or missing. And since they were supposed to be white, they were visibly dingy.. . The casino - Signs pointing you where to go are confusing. As a group of 6, we got lost quite a bit, continually walking in circles, even when sober, lol! We actually started paying attention to location markers like light fixtures and escalators as points of reference because the signs were useless. Not to mention, the casino constantly had dirty glasses and beer bottles everywhere. The place just couldn't stay cleaned up. The Strip entrance to the casino was horrid. The glass doors were never clean, with a dirt film of finger and handprints covering the inside and outside.. . Call me partial, but I love a clean, well appointed hotel, no matter if its cheap or expensive. If I'm paying upwards of $800 for 3 days, I want what I paid for which is high quality, good service and cleanliness. I'm very disappointed with the cleanliness and upkeep of Planet Hollywood. I have stayed in many different hotels on the strip from the Stratosphere to the Bellagio and I will not stay at Planet Hollywood again. I will not recommend it to anyone.
Saw Britney!  She had nice titsies.  Put on a great show.  Won $$$ here too!  Great place
I have stayed here a few times and the atmosphere of this hotel is young and fun. Has a very romantic feel to the casino floor. The rooms are smaller compared to a few hotels but still very nice. The rooms also are up to date and clean and have different movie themes to them which is fun! The buffet here is okay nothing special. They have a Starbucks and a pf changes downstairs which is nice. Miracle mile is also attached to this hotel which has tons of nice shops and restaurants to eat out.
This was my first time going to Vegas and since we were seeing Britney we decided to stay at PH since they're hosting the show and it had a great location on the strip. We found the hotel on the strip right away but finding the parking garage was tricky. We got a little lost but eventually found the garage. It's nice that they offer free parking but I didn't realize that if you park in the garage you then have to walk with all your luggage through the mall. It wasn't a quick walk either! The hotel itself is really nice and we were really happy with our room even though it was very standard. It was clean and modern and we were really comfortable. . . Pros:. -We loved the nearby restaurants. Burgr is in the lobby and was really good. We also liked cabo wabo cantina and pin up pizza. . -attached to the mall so easy access to the shops. -super convenient if you're seeing Britney. You just take the elevator down from your room to the lobby. It was also nice seeing her face ALL over the hotel. It helped get us even more excited than we already were.. -reasonable rates. . . Cons:. -pool! And this was a big, big con for me! That pool area was so disappointing! You walk outside and it's this big ugly concrete landing with pool chairs and a few daybeds but no pool in sight. We walked around extremely confused before we found the damn pool. They have two boring rectangular pools: one for all ages and one that's adults only. They pools are are at a higher level than the concrete landing with all the chairs so unless you rent one of the few daybeds or cabanas surrounding the small pools you're stuck laying out on the concrete landing without even a view of the pool. I was really bummed. . - inconsiderate maintenance staff! At 4:15am we were awoken to someone banging loudly on our door. We had only been in bed for about two hours but the banging woke us up and we were all super confused. We went to the door and asked who it was (without opening the door because we didn't know if it was just a drunk crazy person) and he yelled that he was maintenance and our neighbors had complained that our toilet was running and it was keeping them up. We told him that it was way too early and we were sleeping and the front desk needs to call us and explain the situation before just sending someone up to bang on our door at 4am. The whole situation was just completely inappropriate. Every hour or so our toilet would make a running water sound but it wasn't even that noticeable. We were sleeping in the room with no issue and the sound was not disturbing us. The from desk called us and we told them that they could send someone up at 7am. They didn't even offer an apology about waking us up. We were really pissed.. . The next time I go to Vegas I'll be staying at a hotel that has a better pool.
This hotel room is a 3 star. The service is a 3. First stay I had a broken key card door. Took 30 mins for them to open it. The room service was lacking as they forgot a few minor things as I come back. Overall room is standard. I would rate more at a 3.5 star. The casino floor is nice tho. The pleasure pit is a eyecandy. Who doesnt want a dealer dress all skimpy with ass and tittys all out at 12pm. Haha. Free show if u ask me. Other casinos do that but later at night. PH does it daily and early. Overall wont mind staying here again. It located next to the mall so thats a good thing.
Con: Took forever to check in (20 mins waiting on line).  The rooms were okay.  Some chipping here and there on furniture etc.. . Pros: LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. Great casino staff.. Cool food options.
The best part about Planet Hollywood is the location. Its right in the middle of some of the best hotels and shopping. The casino is pretty basic, they have a restaurant, several bars and tons of machines. Their little gift shop is a great place to stock up on snacks and trinkets. The pool has a huge cement area for laying out in the middle of an adult pool and a family pool. This is a nice budget place to stay at if you are looking to save your dollars but you won't get anything overly impressive.
Just returned from a 4 day stay at Planet Hollywood. I was surprised at how rundown the hotel appears now.  My first stay at PH was in May 2011.  My husband and I were both excited to stay on the Strip for our first Vegas trip together, as PH is well located for sight-seeing and casino hopping.  At the time, we were pleased with our room and the overall hotel, though the pool area left a lot to be desired..     Fast forward to 2014:  Upon arrival, we found the check-in process to be quick and pleasant.  The lobby and casino still appear to be sparkly and well-maintained.  Upon entering the elevators we were confronted with the first signs of wear and tear - dented and scuffed elevator doors and dirty floors.  When we disembarked on our floor, we noticed the carpets were stained and bubbling up in sections of the hallway.  The wallpaper was marked and there were actual dents in the walls.  We held our breath when opening the door to our upgraded room, a Junior Suite..      Surprisingly the room afforded a great deal of space, as the bathroom seemed to be the size of a standard room, with a giant soaking tub, separate shower and toilet closet.  The decor is not dated but feels worn.  That, coupled with the obvious smell of stale smoke (in a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor) and a mystery stain on the armchair in the room, did little to inspire great confidence in the cleanliness of the facilities.  The bed was comfortable but the pillows were awful, too flat or lumpy and much too firm. The most disappointing aspect of the room though, was the lack of a mini-fridge or minibar.  As we were traveling with a group of friends and knew we would be spending some time in the room, we thought we would keep a few cold beverages on-hand to while away the time.  Alas it was not meant to be, as they obviously want you out of the room and on the casino floor. .       The pool is as bad as I remember from 2011.  The deck is a giant, white, concrete space, with chairs arranged around an outside bar.  You can't actually see either pool from the deck, you have to walk up a flight of stairs and try to wrangle space around the pool itself.  Of course, you could pay extra for a daybed or cabana next to the pool.  These "extras", however, are no cleaner than the regular chaise lounges.  The daybeds all have stains on them and the cabanas are just slightly less dirty..       Overall, the state of the hotel beyond the public areas, is disappointing.  For the price, inflated at checkout by the accompanying Resort Fee and other add-ons, I expected more.  I rated it 3 stars due to its location, the good restaurants within the casino itself and their customer service.
Friendly dealers that show lots of skin. The fully clothes ones are not as friendly. I WONDER WHY? . . Overall casino is built for the younger crowds of las vegas. The main reason I stay here is for Earl Of Sandwich. You can read the review about that place here. The casino vibe is good, music is a little loud like i said, built for the youngins. As an old fart like me, sometimes i like the quieter casino area to enjoy my ass beatings on the table. . . Drink service could be better, some of the cocktail waitress knows how to get the drinks to u, some of them like 10 years to get u 1 drink.
WARNING: If you choose to play this casino, GUARD YOUR CHIPS, wear snug-fitting clothes and pocket your large chips AT ALL TIMES.. . Negative stars!  I was robbed by two thieves working together at a craps table last Saturday night 08/23/14.  They came up, we made room for them, they acted like they wanted to play, then they threw down a bogus ID at the table, but they were rejected for invalid ID.  They began using distraction routines and grabbed several large chips off my stack on their way out.  I actually caught them, but they only returned part of what they stole then ran off.  I raised hell with dealers and bosses, but security took several minutes to show up and by then the thieves were long gone.  The twenty-something "security" guys handed me a piece of paper with an 800 number and an incident number and was told to have a nice day. This took 1.5 hours and pretty much wrecked the evening.. . Description: two young, African-American, VERY fit/athletic/lean/ripped, one had dreadlocks, both dressed like hipsters (tank tops, sneakers, ball caps, sagging shorts, etc).. . Unbelievable.  Contact me if you'd like more details.
This was my worst experience at this location... This whole experience started bad from the beginning when we arrived. First off the valet was closed, not a big problem we will self park which is not close, you have to walk the miracle mile to get to the hotel..  We arrive to check in and that took us standing an hour & a half in line before we said screw this were not gonna miss our show. We stepped out of the line and decided to leave our luggage at the concierge. . Hours later, We finally checked into the hotel and were given a crappy room that was 2 queens not 1 king like we had asked. There was a seat that had suspicious white stain on the arm.  The restroom was horrible, we had dirty towels, a running toilet bowl, the water in the shower did not drain and the mirror in front of the restroom was broken. . So ofcourse I call the front desk and was told they could not do anything for the night everything was booked up. I told them to please have the manager call me so I can speak to them personally. I was told he would give me a call later. . So next day rolls around and was moved to a better room with a better view, which was very nice. Again I asked if I can talk to the manager and was told he was in a meeting. . Now we go to check out and I asked one last time to talk to the manager and again he was in a meeting. So we left a negative comment card and ask for them to contact us so we can share our bad experience....  So screw this place they lost my business. I've had very great times here before but I will not return no mo. I do not leave negative reviews but this one had to be done. I have pictures to share. . . Oh and incase your wondering I have not been contacted by management staff to this date. VERY PROFESSIONAL PLANET HOLLYWOOD!!!
I absolutely love PH, and try to stay there every time I go to Vegas. Great prices, AWESOME service, clean rooms, and the beds are SO COMFORTABLE. new linens and down bedding. The rooms are big, and they are all themed after a different hollywood movie. Ask for the strip view (preferably above the 6th floor) to get a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the Paris tower. The pools are a bit small, but one pool is adults only which is great. On the adult side you have to pay to use the daybeds/cabanas, but its worth it if you can spring the extra bucks. But there is free lounging in between the pool areas. The dealers are super friendly, the passion pit rocks, Gordan Ramsay has a burger joint in there, $10 blackjack tables. The location on the strip is perfect, not too far from anything. VALET IS FREE!!! That was a great bonus after a day of traveling (the self park is a million miles away). top notch.
Location! Location! Location!. . Overall my fave hotel in Vegas so far as far as location! It's dead in the center of everything, and the crowd is a lot younger!  Everyone was also very friendly, and the $20 trick (google it) works here!. . Pro. Location!. Won at the slots!. Beautiful casino!. . Con. Housekeeper looks like she picked up with her toes! Called for housekeeping and got back to the same mess, only with clean towels!
Do you just want a basic hotel, great location, not planning on sleeping there anyway? This is the place for you! I read most of the reviews on here before I went. I picked this hotel based on price, location and Britney. I think the way things look are good, bright, done up. Room is basic but I got the batman room, can't imagine that there's a better theme! First day there, we were tired so took a nap around 3-5. (remember we just checked in at 3.) Housekeeping tried walking right into my room, didn't knock, just tried to get right in. I kept all my locks on so didn't see them. I tell the 2 other couples we came with AND they had the same story, but they didn't lock their doors so housekeeping, didnt knock and barged right in?! I just dont understand why they would need to, and seems to be their policy? (one couple was no where near the same floor as us, the other one was on the same floor) So after that, and all the reviews regarding in house theft, I kept my do not disturb thing up and never let housekeeping clean my room. I do agree check in staff was NOT friendly or helpful. Plumbing is very very loud, so every time someone flushed a toilet in a room near mine, it woke me up. Just brushing your teeth would fill the sink because drains were slow. Tub had solid yellow ring in bottom was too gross to use. My husband and the other couple would still stay here again for the price we paid, but I prefer Monte Carlo. So I would not stay here again.
Just awful! . . So I went here mainly to inquire about a show. I asked the concierge where I go to get info on tickets and he directs me to the back cashier. So I go to the back cashier and they said that I was almost there when I came inside, It's by the concierge station. I said impossible because he told me to come here. It was a confusing nightmare. After I told the staff that they aren't very smart, I left and will never return. There's no signage, there's nobody to ask for help, it's a very poorly run casino.
We had another good stay at PH recently.  The staff was polite and attentive.  The room was okay... some slight issues with the toilet flushing and the safe.... . It is a great location on the strip and a good choice of food and shops in the Miracle Mile mall.  We spent a day at the pool which was fun, but the fact that there are no chairs/loungers by the pool is disappointing.  The "runway" in the water took up a lot of space in an already small pool, but the DJ was great.  . The Dailies and BurgR were both spot on.
This was the first hotel I have stayed in vegas and it did not disappoint. I was with my friend & not sharing rooms was the most awesome thing I did. My friend and I had different rooms but they were adjacent to each other, so we could still "share" kind of the room. I did it because us girls need our privacy & we bring tons of products....  Anyways, the rooms were clean, spacious, and the beds were comfortable. There are tons of places to eat next to the casino area. My favorite was YOLOS which was Mexican food & it was so delicious that I had to eat lunch there twice. Minus the smell of cigarette everywhere, which I expect, the Planet Hollywood was just perfection. I loved every minute of it.
This hotel was remodeled just 7 years ago, but it desperately needs some TLC. The room itself is on the spacious side (the bathroom's big). . . General comments: Self-parking in the garage requires a 10 minute walk through the casino and mall which is totally inconvenient. Definitely drop your stuff off and then park your car. Keep in mind they charge a $22/day "resort" fee (no, your room fee doesn't include this...) for wifi on 2 devices, 2 passes to the gym, and local calls. They value this at something like $70(?) per day which is outrageous. Also, if you have four guests in your room, shouldn't they all be able to use the gym? BS if you ask me. . . Bathroom: The shower felt like one I've used at the gym (straight down to the tile), and I honestly questioned if I was at risk for athlete's foot. Plus the long blonde hairs stuck to the wall (we both have black hair...) was rather troubling. There's a separate tub which is nice. The door to the toilet wouldn't close. The counter for the sink was large and big enough for two (but there was only one sink). The towels were rough, thinning, and desperately need to be replaced.. . Bedroom: The furniture is covered in nicks and scratches. The beds look motel status, can't splurge for some nicer pillows? One nice touch is that the comforter is covered in a sheet they change regularly (I assume). The TV is old, but has a good number of channels. The blackout curtain lacked a chain, so it was incapable of moving up or down. I had to call maintenance 3 times, waiting over an hour, for them to come up and fix it. . . While the casino and mall are decent, they in no way make up for the mediocrity of the actual hotel. There are plenty of nicer hotels on the Strip with better service and amenities for the same (if not cheaper) price. I definitely won't be returning.
