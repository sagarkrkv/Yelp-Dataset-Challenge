I like the place it's a great lunch spot. Everything is good but if you order the right thing it's great.
Went to Joe's Farm Grill for the first time today after numerous recommendations and I have to say, I was very pleased! Ordered the Farm Burger, Fries, and a Strawberry Lemonade, all to share between me and my mom which proved to be more than enough food. To my surprise, instead of fries which usually come complimentary with the burger, we received onion rings and I wasn't about to complain (onion rings are an additional $2.50 with a burger). To be completely honest,  there was nothing extraordinary about the burger. It came with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a pickle on the side. It was a good burger, satisfying and filling, but nothing more. The onion rings on the other hand stood out and were none like I've had: extremely hott and fresh, not too oily, and the onion was plump and juicy, none of that half withered crap. The best part of the meal was definitely the strawberry lemonade! It had a perfect balance of lemon and strawberry and tasted so fresh. On top of that,  it wasn't too sweet and was large enough for two people to share. I'd recommend Joe's to anyone in Arizona looking for a decent burger, cool location, family-friendly dining experience, and delicious drinks!!
Just had to throw in my 5 stars.  Just go already.
Brought my wife here for her birthday brunch and we got 10 dollars off her meal. I got the breakfast tacos and coming from south Texas I was a little skeptical about how good they could be but I was quite impressed! It was reasonably priced, too. Pleasant atmosphere with a lot of covered outdoor seating. We will definitely be coming back.
Usually love Joe's Farm Grill, not so much this visit.  Ordered the onion rings, they were so over cooked they were inedible. (Is that a word?  It is now). Would have complained however, we took our food to go.  Most likely will never order them again.
Every time I have eaten here I've been completely satisfied.  Their food is amazing.  my favorite has to be the ribs, but everything is spot on. Service is great,  and the atmosphere is laid back.
My favorite are the breakfast tacos! Everything I've tried here has been delicious. A little pricy but worth it especially every once in a while. They have a lot of grass space for kids to run around and some trees that even I want to climb... Not sure if they actually let you climb them.
A group of us went to eat at Joe's Farm Grill. This is the epitome of a non fancy dining experience! To be honest, it was crowded, we had to wait in line, and the decor is not something to write home about, however, the food was good. Rather than write all the comments given to me by my companions, I have chosen to write some of them down verbatim.. . "The ahi tuna sandwich looked really good, and one of our party really enjoyed it. The burgers were nice and big, and I couldn't believe the size of the fried shrimp. The ribs were really tasty, and the pulled pork was some of the best I've ever had. All in all, a good time was had by all.". . "I've also never seen a bathroom with a television in it before! Quite the experience.". . "The grilled salmon platter was delicious. I could have taken home a tub of the garlic aioli, it was so good!". . Its a bit of an unusual experience to go there, but it's a great place for families especially with a bunch of kids.. . 3 stars for quality and amount of food.
Busy like always but quick service and love not having to tip a server to just have some great food! Had Fish specials today but I've been looking forward to theirburgers! . Still love this place and my kids love it! . Hope they will be here forever!
***attention manager**** . your employees are going to make someone very sick!!!!!!. ***attention manager****. . just so you know, joe / owner/ manager.. employees using gloves to handle food should not be handling money or those customer pagers at the same time.  . someone could take that pager into the bathroom, dip it in the toilet and give it back to the employee handing out food using gloves.. this is disgusting as they go right back to the food to their left and handle customers food. . please teach your employees to change their gloves... this is disgusting.. . . ***attention manager**** . your employees are going to make someone very sick!!!!!!. ***attention manager****
This really is the best lunch place in Gilbert/Mesa if you aren't afraid of a line. Plenty of outside seating and a very cool vibe. The food is fresh and local. Really enjoyable place to eat.
The Ahi Tuna Sandwich was delicious. The meat was cooked perfect and was high quality. I get a similar sandwich when I go to the yard house and let me tell you this sandwich puts the other one on Mcdonalds status. The Milkshakes were just typical milk shakes but you could taste the more quality ingredients. The line was long but moved rapidly. This place is great!
Great place, fresh food, lots of choices . indoor/outdoor seating. Great food. First time here had a great meal and the service is good . The place does get a bit crowded, but is well worth it. My wife had the portabella mushroom sandwich which was fantastic I had Sonoran dogs and really enjoyed them the fries were great too. Definitely coming back
Freaky great casual atmosphere!  And don't miss the bakery next door. Great outdoor and indoor seating, we plan to go back for breakfast with the dogs!
