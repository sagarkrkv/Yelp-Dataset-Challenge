It was pretty good. It was something I had never tried before. I had the salmon one which could have been a little  more flavorful but the one my husband had was quite tasty. We probably will be back.
Ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Asiago. Liked the food and ambience was nice. The oly flaw is that there are more potatoes in chicken tikka masala than chicken itself.
I love this place. Been in twice and both times it was top notch. Great food, big selection, good beer, good deserts. Nothing to complain about besides maybe the wait for a table at times. . . I've had the tikka masala, original, and Mexican chicken. All very good.
Love this place, been going here for years! I could eat Cornish every day. . . Everything I've had here is delicious (and I've had almost every pasty from the Vegetarian menu, the salmon pasty, and almost every dessert). Do yourself a favor and explore the entire menu... try everything! You won't be disappointed :)
love this place!  traditional pub style place with lots on tap including Strongbow Cider.  I went with the Bit Burger Pilsner and a peppersteak pasty and it was awesome as usual.
I absolutly love this place. Servers take a bit long to get to you but the food is worth it.
Amazing food (I had the peppersteak pasty) - friendly knowledgeable staff! Our office orders from here regularly and picks it up and we have been in here a few times as well! I have also been to their other location and it is just as great! Great Job guys!
Delicious and filling. The traditional chips with garlic are a must!
This is delicious. Always on point and you can pick up!
The food here is delicious and the vibe is super chill. I'd use any excuse to come here and enjoy the huge selection of drinks and yummy food. (Chicken Alfredo pastey is bomb)
I have to be honest, when I walked in I had no idea what to expect. It was dark and very subdue. The waitress was very friendly and took our order promptly. Once your eyes adjusts to the darkness its not bad at all. The food arrived quickly and was nice and fresh.. .  I ordered the "Bangers and Mash" and my wife ordered the "Shepherds Pie". We ended up splitting them so we could both try half of the other. I have to say it was really really good. The crust in which the "pies" are baked in are flaky and tasty. . . I slightly preferred the "Bangers and Mash" (Homemade pork with sage sausage, red wine gravy, grilled onions, mashed potatoes, & an extra side of gravy.) over the "Shepherd's Pie" (Ground minted lamb or seasoned ground beef, with peas & carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes, and cheddar. With a side of red wine gravy) But she got it with the ground beef instead of the minted lamb so that might have made a difference. . . All in all my only regret was I did not save room for dessert, well next time, and yes there will definitely be a next time!
Wow!  What a great little gem this place proved to be!  After reading some of the other reviews, I decided I had to give this place a try myself.  I admit, I was skeptical, I'm not a huge 'bread' or 'carb' fan, and I really don't like thick bread coated anything.  The pasties I've had in the past were similar to calzones in breadiness.  The pasties here, were something amazing and not at all what I've had in the past or imagined.  There menu was quite complete with heavier choices such as the meat and cheese to lighter chicken options and even some dessert pasties.  I opted for a chicken tikka masala pasty.  I was impressed by the presentation, a simple metal plate with the well portioned pasty cut in half and a side of tsaziki sauce.  The pasty crust was thin and delicate.  It was reminiscent of a hand worked Christmas pie dough that your Grandmother slaved over.  It wasn't too flaky or thick, and was the perfect match for the tasty filling.  The filling was delicious chunks of white meat chicken, little nibbles of potatoes and some peas in a deliciously balanced flavorful masala sauce.  The taste was quite authentic and the spice right on par with what I'd expect from an Indian food restaurant.  The tsaziki side sauce was cool and tangy, it was a good flavor contrast to the spicy meat pocket.  Since the  portion was rather large, I had more than half of my pasty left and took it to go.  I couldn't resist trying the PB&J pasty though.  I had one warmed and packaged to go.  I am SO glad I got the PB&J pasty as well.  It was so incredibly delicious!  Served with a side of fresh whipped cream, the PB&J was like an old childhood friend.  The warm crunchy peanut butter with the perfect banana slice and sweet strawberry jelly melted harmoniously in my mouth and still gave that satisfying 'coat your mouth' feeling that peanut butter does.  I will definitely return.
I've had a lot of people tell me to go here and I finally saw what all the rage was about. The lamb and mint was delicious. I will definitely be going back.
Most people measure their lives in important milestones - your first kiss, marriage, buying a home, the birth of a child, a big promotion. My own timeline merely has two distinct halves - the time before I ate at Cornish Pasty and the time after. Every memory, every experience, every relationship before I put that first savory bite of pasty in my mouth is merely a shade of everything afterwards.. . What had I been doing with my life? Had I really tasted - really, truly tasted - food before? With the fervor of a religious convert I questioned everything I once thought I knew about the gastronomical experience. Some people might accuse me of hyperbole, but rest assured, they're either idiots or they've never actually eaten at Cornish Pasty.. . I favor the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty. Think of an ideal Salmon dinner - complete with asparagus and rosemary potatoes - rolled up into a perfectly baked calzone-like dough crust and that's about what you're eating. Served with a mustard cream sauce, it's about the tastiest thing on which you'll ever put your filthy mouth.. . If that weren't enough, there're about 100 other pasties that will make your taste buds weep for joy and then ask for more. But wait there's more, they have beer. More specifically, they have Guinness, which happens to be the perfect drinkable compliment to the pasty. Funny how that works, huh?. . Enough talk, go get yourself to Cornish and have a life-changing experience. You can thank me later when I see you at the next Pasty Lovers Anonymous meeting.
Had a lamb vindaloo pasty, it was delicious! Like the way that food was prepared to order.
Love this place! I ordered lamb n mint pasty covered in red wine sauce.. Meat was well done. Got the indian flavors bursting in my mouth with my first bite. Also tried the chicken tikka masala and it is uber delicious ... must try for all food lovers !!!
Oh my f*ing God.  I don't have enough good things to say about this place! !! The food here is fantastic!  My boyfriend and I always start of with the oven Frys with jalapenos and garlic.  You can't go wrong with anything off the menu, my favorites are the chicken pot pie,  salmon,  and shepherds pie.
Their soups are GREAT! The service can be iffy sometimes and it is very dark and hot. The employees are kind of a "grunge" crowd. However, last time I went, I got food poisoning. I would say eat there, but the food is the only good part about it. Good selection of beer, wine...not at all.
Wow! We initially went to BYBLOS but they didn't come to our table for 10 mins and then shouted at me for wanting to leave. Yeah - not what I call "hospitable" - not sure I will go back. It was the older, bald man about 70 years old.. . So we found this place via Yelp. It had to be God's will BECAUSE this place ROCKS! Plenty of Vegan/Vegetarian options too!!! It is a hip scene and the atmosphere is a little gritty; reminiscent of a British Punk bar without the drug addicts pissing in the dark corners. The food was rib-sticking food - like a coal miner would eat! (That is their theme - coal mining). Our server, Brandon, made some terrific recommendations and was efficient. They play cool tunes - but kinda loud. So if you're looking to talk and be heard - sit outside.. . A solid 5 stars!
