We were spending the weekend in town but did not want to break the bank staying at super fancy hotels...but didn't want to stay at a shabby one either. I had stayed here previously when it was still the Las Vegas Hilton & had a great experience. We reserved our standard room for $69 & was able to get upgraded to a premium room for just $8.. . One of the first things we usually do when we get into a hotel is to turn on the TB & just sit back for a little bit. Unfortunately, we couldn't do that because the TV wasn't working. Well, never mind since there is plenty to do in town.. . When paying for the room, the resort fee guarantees free wi-fi access, but for 1device only so be careful when logging on.. . Our stay was good & we even enjoyed a brunch at the Paradise Cafe. My biggest peeve was the slowness of the elevators. Even with multiple elevators, the average wait time was still over a minute...& that was during the not busy hours when most of the hotel guests were out of their rooms.
One star is way too much for this hotel!  Worst hotel ever!!!  Front desk crew is bad. I can't remember the clerks name but stopped in at around 3:50 on 8/3 Vegas time to check on our room charges. When I inquired about the resort fee since it wasn't mentioned to us when we checked in, she treated us like we were trying to pull a fast one on her. She treated us like she owns this freaking hotel and we were stealing from her.   This is not how you should treat your customer!  This lady just left a really bad taste in my mouth. AND the casino looks so run down and it had such a bad old stink to it. Never coming back here again even if this was the last hotel standing in Vegas.
My husband had a trade show at the convention center and his company paid for his hotel room at this hotel.  If I had paid for this hotel myself, upon arrival I would have looked for another one ASAP but it was free for the weekend so what the heck.  . . Just driving up to valet it looks run down.  Hotel rooms are just normal but had a faint smell of cigarette smoke, the whole place needs a facelift and a good deep cleaning.  The pink tile in the bathroom is just gross and the plumbing in the bathtub was rusty.  . . I happened to drop something down by the side of the bed and when I picked it up I noticed an extremely thick layer of dust piled up along the wall by the baseboard like it hasn't been vacuumed in YEARS!  GROSS! . . I don't know if the rooms are non-smoking but someone in one of the rooms next door was smoking and the smoke was coming into our room.  It was disgusting.  . . And don't waste your money at the Paradise Cafe - over priced and worst Eggs Benedict EVER.  The hollandaise sauce was like mayonaise.  . . Like others have said on here, the monorail goes from the Convention Center to other MUCH BETTER hotels in the area.  I would go that route instead of this hotel until they update it and/or clean it.
This place is a total dump and no one is there to gamble because it sucks and everyone is rude. We only went there because they were advertising a sports bet that they didn't have. Don't ever go here. Ever. It's horrible.
I recently stayed at the this casino for the Evo event. They allowed us to to check in early which was greatly appreciated. Our room was very clean. The staff was also very friendly and helpful whenever we had any questions. I do want to say Thank You to their security and those who found and turned in my license. Thank you very much again.
I have to say that my experience there was really great!!! To check in was a breeze everyone there was great I do recommend that you pay the extra 20 dollars for the renovated room. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because every way you turned the staffed tried to sell my boyfriend and I a time share. Dinner at the sushi restaurant was great well priced and the staff was attentive. We will definitely be back especially after all the renovations are done.
Never. Ever. Again. I had to stay at this hotel to be close to the convention center this past May. It's one of the biggest conventions they have, so you would think that a little prep work might have gone into their hospitality. No. The room that I stayed in was dirty, but even stains I can get past (blood stain on me sheet that, after 3 days was never changed). The thing I can't get over is the service. I had arranged for breakfast to be brought to my room every morning. I called the night before and was told it would be to my room first thing. I stressed that I had to be out of my room by 8 in the morning at the absolute latest. They said, not a problem. 2 out of the 3 days, it never came. Just never came at all. After I called and called I was met with rude ladies who seemed more aggravated that I was bothering them than anything else. Also, I called them to have my tv fixed which wasn't working. I had to call 4 times to get even a timeline of when I might see someone. After a few hours, I decided to give it a go myself. I would seriously dismay any person from ever booking here. Being in close vicinity to the convention center is not worth the lack of service and filth that this hotel has to offer. . . I will say that there is one saving grace. The bell hops who brought up the food (the one time it came for breakfast) and the other time when we ordered dinner (extremely low in quality...I don't recommend it) were extremely nice. They were older and seemed genuinely concerned with our well being. . . Super side note, the people who end up at that pool seem like Vegas's throw aways...just saying.
Booked this hotel through a third party so was surprised by the sneak attack resort fee at check in.. Be aware. It doesn't matter what you paid or how you paid it. They will up charge you.. Staff was very nice and although they are stationed at every corner trying to sell you things they politely take no thank you for an answer.. Our room was nice. Clean and comfortable. Bathroom was outdated and had to call maintenance to replace a light.. Unfortunately they couldn't fix the shower faucet that required hard core ninja kicks to turn it on and off.. If you choose to forgo housekeeping and "go green" they slip an $8 voucher under your door. That will AMOST buy you a cup of overpriced coffee.. Small fridge in the room but that's it. ( no coffee.....sigh). If you do not enjoy dj hosted club music you won't be able to enjoy the pool in the evenings. I don't think it'd even be so bad if it were at least a more "general audience" selection.. Not alot of dining options in the hotel that are open evening hours. Weird for Vegas.. Off the strip and lots of parking in the garage. I guess it could've been worse.
Great price huge room. No question 4 stars but they bother you way touch with there deals. Went to check out  and the lady was super rude. Worst service out of any hotel I have been to. But once again great value and connected to the monorail which is huge cause its a little off the strip. Stop selling ahit in your lobby won't go back because of this
Don't believe every negative review you read. I've been staying at The LVH for years now. I usually never have any problems. The one time I have any type of issue, it was addressed right away. Rayleen at the front desk was so sweet and did as much as she could for me until Jason, the manager was avaiable. Not only was the problem I had taken care of right away, Jason went way above and beyond and set up my family in a huge suite and waved my upgrade fees. Thank you Jason for making my 4 day weekend a vacation to remember. The kids' jaws dropped when they saw where we'd be staying for the next 3 nights. . . Yes, this hotel is older and some of the rooms need upgrades. But they have updated rooms available for just a little extra. That's why there are different rates. You get what you pay for so if you wanna be super cheap, don't expect the best. I opted to pay an extra $20 for an upgrade and it was so much better. I figure I'll probably lose several hundreds on gambling. Why not treat myself to a nice room for only $20. So basically, don't complain if you're going to be cheap LOL. . Another perk is that there are hardly any bachelor or bachelorette parties going on. Less crowds which helps keeps the pool nice and mellow. Our morning routines was to go to the pool as soon as they opened and enjoyed it until it got too hot in the afternoon. Very family friendly or perfect for a mellow girls weekend trip. . . I'm planning 2 more trips back already. Love Vegas and I can only stay at LVH where I know I'll be taken care of :)
I was totally let down by the Hilton. I stayed here for a business trade show week long. The morning buffet was horrible. One day it didn't open until 1130am another day it didn't open until 800am.
Sports book terrible.  College opening saturday.  One waitress.  Lines long to place bets.  They are not what they used to be.  I brought 4 out of towners claiming this is the best.  Gonna leave to another spirtsbook.
