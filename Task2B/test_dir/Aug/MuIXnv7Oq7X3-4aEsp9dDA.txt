Went to brunch had teh apple pancake was very good.  Wife had the scrambled eggs ( 6 yes 6).  They were good but not great.  There were no meat choices for sides.  Cost $96 including tip for 4, NO BOOZE
There's nothing less than great about this restaurant.. It's affordable, the food is unbelievably good, and service is impeccable. It's one of two places in the Phoenix area to try the amazing chopped salad, which I would recommend to anyone as an appetizer. Their bar snacks are great and at certain times, half off. The heirloom bacon popcorn is my favorite.. . Their dishes feel traditional but offer twists with consistency and ingredients. For example, their truffled grilled cheese is stuffed with wonderful mashed potatoes.
Good food has to be accompanied by good service, imho, and this place does that very well !  Great salad, heck it has its own facebook page its so popular, but the service is just as good.  Well done !
There's nothing I wouldn't eat off this menu. Every bite of every course I've enjoyed here has always been perfect. Perfect in an okay  ready for heaven kind of way. . . I do have to mention the deep sea crab cakes b/c they're the best crab cakes I've had in a while. Hands down.  I was there last night, and I'm still thinking about those crab cakes. . . They put out high quality and wonderfully fresh food. Hats off to the chef.
Service: amazing. Our waiter was awesome! He was super friendly and I noticed he was very personable with all his tables. Very pleasant. Their staff is very on top of it.. . Atmosphere: this is why I am taking a star off. It was crazy loud. I don't know if it is normally like that but it was so loud that I felt that I was shouting across the table to be heard. It had a fun vibe but honestly way too loud. I felt like I was in a club type atmosphere and not a restaurant. . . Food: started off with the Mac and cheese which was actually pretty good. Had a nice flavor to it. Also had the burrata which was very delicious!! I had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and zucchini and it was amazing. Best meatloaf I have ever had and the portion size was huge. My bf ordered the filet, med/rare and he said it was cooked perfectly and delicious! . An overall great experience!
came for a late dinner after flying into sky harbor. our server was the friendliest and most enthusiastic person I've ever met, but not in an overbearing or fake way. he seemed familiar with the entire menu and also the beers as well. each of our entrees was perfectly seasoned and balanced (lamb burger, scallops, and grouper). the coconut dessert was also fantastic. one complaint would be that the restaurant is all concrete and hard surfaces, making a fairly loud group of youngish patrons sound even louder. if I could give this place a 4.5 I would.
Great drinks!!!. . Menu is different in a good way!. . Price is very reasonable for the quality of food and drink you receive.. . Late night menu is always interesting!
Love this place! People that work there are awesome and always remember us & what we like. Who doesn't want to go to a place like that.
I love Citizen Public House. I always sit at the bar, try at least two or three of their cocktails and usually just have some appetizers. The staff, atmosphere, drinks, wine, it's all on point. . . There's not much else to say. I just really like it here.
The best part about Citizen is the BACON! Seriously, I think they put bacon on everything! Popcorn made with bacon grease and bit of bacon, bacon dessert, bacon drinks....Bacon is the way of life at Citizen and there's nothing wrong with that!. . I usually hit up Citizen for Happy Hour after work. They have great prices on snacks & appetizers (we always get the fondue and flatbread), plus the Happy Hour drinks are 1/2 off and some of their specialty drinks are also cheaper. For a great Happy Hour, check it out.. . That said, I always said I wanted to go to Citizen for dinner, it's just a bit pricey for a college graduate who's paying off student loan debt. I finally had a chance to be wined and dined at Citizen a few weeks ago for a work event. Man, was I impressed! Going to dinner and having work foot the bill is the best - we went all out!. . We started with all of the Happy Hour snacks. Fondue was my favorite (can't go wrong with bread, meat, and melted cheese!) but the bacon popcorn was amazing as well! Again, BACON!. . For the main course, I had the scallops. They were perfectly prepared, lightly seared, with veggies and a delicious garlic mashed potato puree. Gah, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Coworkers had the lamb burger (which is to die for, I guess) and the pork chops. Again, looked super delicious - the presentation is amazing!. . Dessert was the chocolate mousse thingy. It was decadent and rich, but we definitely ate the whole thing!. . For the lower class, dinner is a bit pricey, but for a special night out (or every night, if you're Bill Gates) I highly recommend Citizen! If you can't afford dinner, opt for Happy Hour and you'll get to experience the delight of Citizen.. . Side Note - I've also had the mac-n-cheese and it's to die for! It's a great dinner alternative and pairs well with an ice cold beer on tap.
great service, food, and atmosphere. Loved the scallops, chicken, and chopped salad! Try their other restaurant, "The Gladly" in Biltmore, too!
Ugh the mussels verde were disgusting. Small portion with three mussels and even delivered with oneclosed! Good service though. It was comped but very fishy
This is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Been dozens of times and never disappointed. The happy hour is a great deal, the cocktails are delicious and creative and the food is excellent. The prices for food aren't bad either. If you haven't been before then you are missing out!
Probably the best porkchop I've ever had,  super flavorful (got it medium rare). Fondue is wonderful as well, also got the Four Seasons beer they had on tap and a Moscow Mule, which both complimented the meal well. A bit on the expensive side but well worth the price.
This was hands-down our favorite restaurant while visiting Scottsdale.  It has a lively, trendy vibe, fabulous service, and impeccable innovative food that's not too stuffy. . . First, the hosts and waitstaff were exceptional and very helpful. Sam our waiter was wonderful throughout -- super knowledgeable and honest.. . Cocktails are the bomb -- definitely try the spicy Thai margarita.. . Don't miss the original chopped salad (which has its own Facebook page). It really is special.  We also tried the burrata and a special of the evening -- an amazing ramen with Argentine spot prawns.  The cocoa jar for dessert was also fabulous.. . I wish we had more nights in Scottsdale as we would have definitely returned!
With 777 reviews how could you pass this up? I finally made time to come here and I am so glad I did! :) I'm a really big fan of pork belly and look what I found: Pork belly pastrami starter!!! This place has surpassed any other pork belly I've tasted thus far in AZ! The pork belly melted in my mouth and matched well with the brussels sprouts. The truffled grilled cheese meshed with the white truffle mashed potatoes. Ended with the Cocoa Jar with chocolate crispies and cookie and whip cream in a jar. . With an eclectic menu I'm sure to come back for the short ribs - another of my favorite entrees to try. There was a mixed crowd of people here. Service was great and my water was always filled. Great job guys!!. . P.S. So sorry that I forgot to take pics of the pork belly pastrami and grilled cheese. Devoured it all. Next time though.
Excellent service and food.. . Crabcakes and scallops were top-notch - expect small portions
The service here is great, always on top of everything. Food is phenomenal I recommend the ribs. Moscow mules are fantastic! Trendy vibe!
Best meal I've had in the Phoenix area since moving here last year. . Collectively, we order the chopped salad, filet mignon, and the scallops. Everything was absolutely amazing. My manhattan was equally impressive. I highly recommend this restaurant.
