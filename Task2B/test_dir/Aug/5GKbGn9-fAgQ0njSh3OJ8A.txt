Had an amazing meal here! The cocktails were great. The vibe is very cool- we had our meal in the lounge so I can only really speak for that area. The complimentary garlic bread is flat out the BEST garlic bread you will ever have. The meat ball was incredible. Calamari was good. Cheese pizza was good.
The newly renovated lounge is a perfect place for a chill night in Vegas--great vibe and atmosphere, fantastic music, delicious cocktails and most importantly FRIED OREOS. We ordered the Ricotta Meatballs, Tomato Basil Pizza, and the Calamari--all of which was incredible, but did I mention the friend oreos? Yeah, one of the best things I've ever tasted!
Had an awesome dinner at Lavo. Other than wait about 1/2 hour past our 9 PM reservation this place was perfect. They had a DJ playing great music during dinner and the food was amazing. Our group tried the lobster bisque, minestrone, Cesar salad, spaghetti with tomato and basil, chicken parm and spaghetti and meatballs and all of them were amazing. Highly recommended and we will be back!
Food was good, service was great. We started with a salumi platter which had prosciutto, salami, cheeses and bread. I had the sea bass which was wonderfully prepared, crisp seasoned crust on the outside, juicy in the inside with a light sauce and fresh tomatoes. My co-diners had pasta which were giant portions.. . We sat on the outside patio which was really pleasant right on the strip.. . Great drinks too!
Had dinner there tonight. Food was really good. Marguerita pizza was fab, the Truffle fries were SICK! That alone was worth the trip for me. Not to impressed with the Pomegranate Lemonade drink. The waiter was AWESOME! I did feel like the support staff was rushing to clear our food, even tho we weren't done yet :/ Would def visit again.
upscale Italian in a swanky lounge atmosphere. can you dig it? I can.. . started with some really good garlic bread. I'm still going to mock people who get overworked over garlic bread, but this was quite addictive.. . the menu is pretty standard Italian with a bit of steakhouse mixed in. my "crispy chicken Dominic" was an excellent choice, coated in a chili/balsamic glaze and perfectly tender, juicy, and flavorful. nice kick from the chili peppers!. . as for the drink, I had the Amaro Is Another Day, which was pretty tasty. it had amaro liqueor, which is similar to Fernet Branca, and I think simple syrup. sidenote: I have a love/hate with Fernet Branca because it was everywhere in Argentina.. . dessert was the highlight of the meal. we got the plate of Oreo zeppole with malted vanilla dip. yes, it's like what you'd get at a street fair or carnival, but without the gut-clenching pains to follow after.. . service was excellent and the DJ was on point playing a great upbeat mix (but not too loud and overbearing).
Over-priced, mediocre food and lousy service.. 1. My $35 steak was dry and didn't come with anything else other than lemon and decoration. . 2. Most of the waiters look like they hate their jobs. I thanked a waiter for refilling my water glass and he grumbled a very insincere "you're welcome." And yet another waiter dropped and broke a glass object behind my sister, terrifying her and my mother. He then left it there and left without a word. No "sorry" or anything. . 3. Music is too darn loud. I came here to enjoy my dinner and company, not having to yell to have a conversation. . . Will certainly not be coming back. I could have eaten better food for a cheaper price and better service elsewhere.
Meatballs.. Lavo has mastered the art of the perfect meatball!  A friend and I always go and split it. It's an appetizer and we get full.. And the. Garlic butter bread....ok that's enough my mouth Is now watering.
This place is awesome!! This is our second time dining here and it never disappoints. We had the chilean sea bass, dover sole, shrimp scampi, spaghetti with meatballs which are all terrific. The music playing in the background are upbeat pop sounds. Most of the diners that come here wear business casual but i saw some in shorts and flip flops.. . We will definitely go back here..
Great atmosphere, awesome drinks but food was horrible. We had the rice balls which were still cold inside, the chicken ravioli and veal parm which both tasted like they could have been at Olive Garden. Even the bread pudding was bad. I would go back for a drink but that's it.
My wife and I really enjoyed the restaurant. The food exceeded our expectations, but the service was just okay. We had reservations for a romantic dinner and ending up having to wait almost 20 minutes past our reservation time. Asked for a booth or corner table and we got sat right in the middle and the tables are very close to one another and its not the intimate that you may be looking for.. My wife absolutely loved the express shot here. Place is worth checking out and making your own opinion.
The service here was awesome.  Our waiter, a transplant from NYC whom we affectionately called Suspenders due to his uniform, was above reproach.  He was funny, personable and patient with our large group of girls out for a night on the town. He cracked jokes with us and showed us pictures of his young son.  Also, he wasn't bad to look at.. . The ambiance was of the trendy lounge-cum-restaurant variety.  The same cookie cutter recipe seen over and over in most cities. Think exposed brick, low lighting, brushed cement floors and ambient music heavy on the bass and low on vocals.  Nothing wrong with it, just nothing to write home about either.  I could walk right now to about 50 places that fit that description.. . The food?  Underwhelming.  To say the very least.  I ordered the gnocchi and was warned prior that it was made of semolina, so I should expect it to be denser than what I may be accustomed to. That may have been the only interesting thing about the dish.  The truffle cream was simply adequate, the rabbit ragu was meh and the whole thing came out tepid.  It seems that whomever was doing the timing back in the kitchen should have waited for the Chicken Dominic that my fellow diners ordered to be nearly done before putting my dish up in the window.  The assessments from the other people in my party (of 7) mirrored my own.  The Chicken Parmesan was 'okay', the Chicken Dominic came off as 'something I could make better myself' and the Chicken Marsala was actually deemed 'worse than the Marsala I made at home last week'.  There was one bright spot in the group: the Lobster Scampi Pizza, which my friend ate up with delight.. . Overall, I can't say it was the worst place I've ever eaten.  But it was forgettable.  And a little disappointing.  Perhaps a little more spice, a little more flavor and some better timing in the kitchen LAVO could elevate itself to 4 stars.  But I just don't see that it will ever have the legs to climb the rungs all the way to the top.
LAVO is an awesome place to day drink during the Saturday brunches. Normally at clubs the security guards are rude and grimacing. However, when we walked up they were very nice (yet strict) at the same time. We had a connection with a promoter to get in line, but once we got in line Justin, the guard at the front, had a great personality and was more then happy to have a conversation. That rarely happens to me in Vegas. Also while we were in line, two of our friends walked up and he let them join us so we didn't get separated. He was the reason I wanted to write this review (GO JUSTIN!). . Aside from the extremely nice staff, this brunch is an activity you HAVE to do when you plan a weekend in Vegas. There is so much activity and the DJs are awesome. If you're like me in vegas, you don't want to sleep all day or just have lunch at McDonalds... You want to have experience new things... and DRINK and NEVER sleep. 5 stars for giving me a crazy time before it even struck 5pm.
