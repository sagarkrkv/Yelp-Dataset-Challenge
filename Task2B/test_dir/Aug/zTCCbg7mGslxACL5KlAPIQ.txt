Amazing! One of the best meals I have ever had. Love the crab legs, potato dishes, shrimp, tri tip, stuffed cabbage, bread pudding, to name a few. This was my second visit and it was as delicious as I remembered. The only thing that disappointed me were the cupcakes, but there were plenty of other dessert options.
I had a very good experience at the Sunday brunch buffet and would go again. The dimsum was not excellent quality compared to dimsum in the San Gabriel Valley, it was just OK. The fresh naan was excellent, and the chicken curry could use a little more kick. I did like the pork belly. The waffles and red velvet pancakes were fine. For $29, I was happy with the experience. The server was prompt with drinks, but we sometimes had to bus our own plates because they were so busy. Prime rib looked good but I was already full. They had extensive desserts which I did not have room for.
What happened to this place ??? The last time I came here 2 years ago, I was in love, but now this place has gone downhill. It's horrible the food is gross. It makes the Japanese buffets look like 7 stars. Avoid at all costs. Don't believe me just ask to walk and look.
Great selection of good. Food is cooked and displayed well. Good lighting & good music playing. I would definitely come back.  My only complaint is that it took about 7-10 minutes for us to put in our order for regular drinks. Outside of that, we had a good experience.
Given that the Aria Hotel and adjacent Crystal Shops are jaw dropping in their design, the buffet is especially disappointing.  Not much that you want to eat and, I am sorry to say, the seating area was quite dirty.  The tables remind me of the waiting area at the local auto club.  . . The extra star for this otherwise two-star review belongs to the Naan -- it's just awesome.  Made by hand as you watch and cooked in this heated earthenware pot ... oh man.  Who needs dessert?  . . However, should we be spending $40 for a casino buffet just for the Naan?   Nein.
The food here was spectacular. Service was a little slow. But with this aside, it was a great experience. Just don't pick a table near the window if people aresitting in the spa... you peer right out at them... AKWARD!
I like how fresh the food are. this buffet serves a wide variety of international dish. I'm not a big fan of their flan. It's too light and it's almost like a mediocre creme Brule, Other than that, I love the atmosphere and the staff.
I have read some of the other reviews that rated this poorly and am a bit shocked. We went for lunch and for $65 including tax and tip for two, this is a great place to eat. To be clear, it is not the best food ever...it is a Vegas buffet! There is tremendous variety of meats ( the fried chicken is awesome...crispy and spicy) salads, Indian...good nan, crab legs - pre split so you can eat lots and lots, shrimp, etc etc. there is Chinese dumplings and rices, some meat and veg and sushi. Of course there is lots of dessert - the sugar free strawberry sorbet is excellent. . . Staff was friendly and the entire surroundings were very clean. We are not buffet people, but felt that when in Vegas....do a buffet. We were not disappointed. Great value for the money and very competently and tasty food.
The food was fresh lots of variety  still one of the best it LV   the service was good Our Waiter Randy was excellent
For the price of the buffet, it was not that bad. I think that it was around $44 a person, and it had king crab, shrimp, oysters and mussels. So if you're going to a Vegas buffet just for crab, I would come here. However they did not have a good selection of sushi, actually the sushi didn't look fresh at all and I did not eat any of it. The Asian food section served the worst pad thai I've ever eaten, and the dim sum wasn't that great either. I did like the carving station because the lamb was extremely good and they actually had mint jelly which surprised me because a lot of buffets do not serve lamb let alone provide mint jelly. But as I mentioned before if you just want to eat king crab then you should go to this buffet because it is $20 cheaper then Caesar's Palace, but if you want more variety this is not the place to go.
AMAZING!!!! Had a Sunday Brunch Buffet on Aug 10 and a lunch on Aug 12.  We also did the unlimited drinks for Brunch.  It has everything you could possibly want, yes its not as big as other buffet but what it does it does REALLY well!!! Red Velvet stuffed pancakes, crab legs, Yum!! Give it a shot you will love it!!!
The design and layout of the food was very nice.  With that being said, there weren't a whole lot of options considering how much we paid to get in.  They have some of the cheesiest mac and cheese I have ever had, but other than that it was just OK.  I would rather spend my money on a different restaurant.
So me and the wife decided to go to the buffet in the hotel that we are staying at. The reviews were all over the place, but everyone's buffet pallet is different. I think we made a good choice listening to Matt R. . . I had alot of hot snow crab legs(these are prob the most biggest snow crab legs I've seen/eaten. So sweet in flavor. I also had the peel and eat shrimp/cold king crab legs (pre-split), ehh. Didn't really care for the cold stuff. I did get my fix on the hot snow crab legs. . . Got a piece naan put curry chicken on top it. The fresh tandori lamb just came out of the clay pot, that was all the Indian I had and it was delicious. I also had the prime rib, had great flavor. They had this huge, i mean huge piece of beef (possible a leg of beef). Salmon was also good. Sushi, ehh. Not good, but eatable. Dessert was good. All sorts of sweets.. . They'll have something you like. Both of us for dinner=80 bucks. The wait staff was good. Overall worth a visit. If this doesn't convince you to go, think of all you can eat snow crab lags for 40 a person.
The best thing I can say is the staff. Some of the kindest, warmest, people I have ever met! However for an upscale property this buffet is pitiful. Every table had sausage soup display was not indicative of a facility of ur stature. Had to hunt for sauces no sugar free desserts.
Love the aria buffet.  During my 11 day stay in vegas mygirlfriend and I went 3 times and loved it every time. The food is well cooked and seasoned, they refresh the bowls really fast, service was super friendly,  and the variety was amazing.  Recommend going on the weekend for the gourmet menu food is really really great.
We stayed at the Aria for our most recent vegas trip so of course, we had to hit the Aria buffet. Liked it so much we went twice!!. . The first visit was dinner on a Thursday night. We went a bit late (8 or 9PM) and had to wait in line for a short amount of time. There was a wide variety of selection from the salad bar to homestyle food to mediterranean to seafood/sushi and different asian cuisines. I loved the fried rice, sushi, salad bar and pizza. All were high quality and I didn't run into anything that was not well prepared. . . Saturday morning we came back for brunch. In addition to the food, we also ordered the 12.99 bottomless beverages. Those drinks were strong and the waitress made sure to keep our glass full!! The salad bar, pizza and asian dishes/sea food remained but most of the other stations from the night before had been replaces with more "breakfast style" food. There were traditional items like pancakes and french toasts and also some more ethnic cuisines as well. As with dinner, all of the items were well prepared and tasted well. . . I would return to the Aria buffet.
Spacious and overlooking the pool, should you decide to, Aria's Buffet is about as lavish as you can go without going overboard. Exceptionally well-presented and prepaid, the mix runs from bean burritos to pizza toprime rib and a sushi selection rivaling any good restaurant. . . The desserts are very good and handled by a cut-above of staffers. We spaced and timed our consuming to go back for several plates, shared a few things just to try them and had two hours of careful sampling. The big portions went to carved prime rib and the sushi, but not all at once. Tip big; if you're half-smart, the casino will give it back and for our staffers, well-deserved.. . Oh? You didn't look for incentive programs to eat here on a two-for-one or comp? That one's on YOU. Cut the cost to at least half and you've scored bragging rights. . . Las Vegas fare runs from damn awful to sublime, so how you eat is on you: bad nutrition is plentiful; cheap chow and sloppy consumers are plentiful outside, so why not dress a bit nicer and enjoy the Aria's Crystal area? Vegas top name places offer wonderful dinners ad lunches that run from $16 hamburgers to $35 chicken. Forgetpizza anywhere but Chicago, that's a given. It's a getaway: get away from eating the same stuff that you went on vacation to escape.. . Leave the goddamn kids at HOME; this is Vegas and intended for adults, and the Strip outside willgladly eat stupid tourists without a second thought. Avoid most of the food out there. I recommend the Buffet as an overview of cuisine... all well done.
Sehr empfehlenswert! Fruhstucksbuffet lasst keine Wunsche offen, abends ebenso. Wir waren 5 Tage in Las Vegas und haben jeden Morgen das leckere Angebot genossen........ unglaublich was es alles gibt. Sehr viel asiatische Kuche, aber auch italienisch, amerikanisch. Auerst freundliches Personal. Preis/Leistungsverhaltnis ist vollkommen i.O.
I never have high expectations when coming to a buffet.  It was decent the fresh motzerella was so delicious so were the mussels and this clam soup with chorizo. The desserts were good I really enjoyed the gellato wheel.  My waitress I don't remember her name but she was excellent never had to stop her to insist on another drink, napkins or my plates to be tooken off while I'll give it 4 stars not 3. Won't be my first stop to go buffet wise but if I was invited as a group outting I guess I would go again
I am here for lunch and am completely overwhelmed with the selection and variety of food.  Sushi, crab, meat, cheese, salad, Chinese, Latin, it's crazy!  For lunch I am impressed. I can't possibly eat enough! The buffet overlooks the pool too, so there is a lot of natural light which is nice. Come for lunch you won't be disappointed.
I have tried numerous buffets in Las Vegas, and the Aria ranks up with the Paris as tied for my favorites.  I go for the quality of the food and friendliness of staff  when rating them. I don't eat a lot but like the variety you get at a buffet. Marref stands out for her exceptional service!
This is definitely not the Bacchanal buffet. Or Wicked Spoon. So do not get your hopes up. . . My group of 12 decided to come here because half of us got buy one, get one coupons. At $24.99 for breakfast/lunch it's not too bad, but it's not that great. We ate here the last day of our trip because it was so cheap, but it was a bad choice because we just compared everything to Bacchanal. . . One unique thing about this buffet is that they have a section of middle eastern cuisine with curry, hummus, and naan. I don't really like that kind of food though... Especially not in the morning.. . There is a custom omelet bar. What I thought was weird was that there were dollar bills/tips laying on the counter. Uh shouldn't they be in a jar or something to keep it sanitary? And why are people tipping the omelet man when we already paid for our meal and that's his job...? Idk.. . Cons:. The bacon wasn't crispy. . Eggs were watery. . Not many dessert options. . Slow service getting drinks and refills. . Ketchup not available at the tables. . . There are way better places to eat in Vegas. Don't waste your time here unless you have a good deal.
As beautiful as Aria is, the buffet lived up to the aesthetics. We ended up eating at the Aria buffet for lunch the day we landed in Vegas, with anticipation to eat at the Bellagio buffet the following day. I was blow away by the selection at Aria. On any given day you can find, at least five types of dim-sum, fried rice, lo mein,  general tso chicken, assortment of sushi, piles of snow crab legs (already split for convenience), steamed crawfish, assortment of pizzas, Indian food, Israeli type mezze, a carving station, and finally a selection of comfort food. . . We were pleasantly overwhelmed with all the options, considering it was only lunch. Quite a few items are still a bit bland and will need salt, but that is typical with a buffet and hoping to satisfy many palettes. I think the lunch buffet was around $26 (plus tax/tip), which I made up for with just the crab legs I ate. I kept flocking to the chicken shumai dim sum and shrimp dumplings. The curry chicken and tabouleh were also surprisingly good, but these items won't always be available. I completely over looked the soups, but I was informed there was also lobster bisque. . . My only complaint is that the cashier wanted 18% gratuity for our party of 8 to sit together, which perhaps we should have just paid. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Aria buffet, which had a shorter line and was miles better than Bellagio's rendering. Eat here, especially if you're hungover.
We had tested a lot of buffets in Vegas and the buffet at Aria belongs to the most recommended. We enjoyed the Sunday Gala dinner. Although the price is high but there is a great selection! Freshly prepared pasta dishes, Sushi and a selection of meat. Moreover, there are delicious dessert.The staff was attentive and friendly. I would definitely recommend the buffet!
I'm not a buffet fan, but Hubby wanted to try it out for brunch. Nice selection, kept clean and refilled and the waitress was really nice. Crab legs were hot and the desserts were the perfect size. Plenty of different kind of food to choose from.
Cons: Potatoes au gratin were undercooked to the point where they werecrunchy. Sushi rice was stale. Crab was dried up like it had been frozen and then thawed a couple of times, and was tasteless. Gnocchi was dried up as if it had been sitting for hours. The waitress stopped by only twice the whole time, so we could only get one beverage each.. . Pros: Garlic mashed potatoes were excellent. Shrimp ha gow was decent. Dessert whoopie pies were great, as was the bread pudding. The buffet was generally very clean.. . Not worth the $40+ per person for dinner.
Everything was very fresh. The meats were delicious! They had a tandoor/Mediterranean area, but limited on selections. All you can eat crab legs, shrimp, mussels, crawfish. Asian bar, salad bar,  sweets bar, and breakfast Bar. It was all very good, but will try some other buffets this week. Our server Ruby was the best server. She is so happy all the time, sweet, and attentive. The drinks for 12.99 bottomless was a great deal.....if you can fit anything in after that food selection lol. Just wish they had more variety. The place is super clean and the music is awesome.
Hello everyone!  Just a quick review for.those who are visiting Las Vegas. The food is delicious and the service plus.the cleanliness is.impeccable! . We. Had the king crab legs ( also cut open for you for your convenience) with some shrimp hargow and , coconut Jasmine rice.I also tried.the roasted red pepper hummus ( home made) with garlic naan and the spring mix with pears and balsamic dressing. There is a carving station with. Hot dogs, burgers, and sausage,  plus a station for Latin,  Mediterranean, Asian food and seafood full of shrimp, oysters,  crab, sushi,  and crawfish. The desserts are crafted beautifully as well, with red velvet moonpies,  key lime pie, bananas foster and gelato.  The pies are petite in size so they are just filling enough, but do not lack any flavor! I would say this buffet is worth the price so.come hungry!
