It's a meh kinda airport. It's older and large for no reason. Takes forever to get your bags, at least from American Airlines. Waiting for a bag at the airport is the OPPOSITE of what you want when you're ready to hit the strip.. . Also when I just checked, there were no Uber cars available. WTF?! I had never seen this on my Uber screen. I thought it was a mistake. Usually iUber shows at least one car maybe 6-15 minutes away. Absolutely nothing. Maybe this airport doesn't allow Uber... I'm not up on the latest Las Vegas news.
The airport is kinda old. There are some charging stations near the restroom. But, they aren't very many. Would be nice to have more outlets.
Red eye out and they still have cheese frys! Good air port! Quick and easy check in and everyone's really friendly..
Service was decent enough, but the layout of the airport is rather convoluted. So much zig-zag running and train-catching between checking in, security, gate, and other places. Arrive here especially early to allow for all of the waiting in lines and hurrying, seemingly from one side of the place to the other.
Gross, loud, and crowded. . . While they seem to be trying to help with the "recharge zone" stations, there are definitely not enough electrical outlets for a modern airport, especially since all those slot machines have to be running on something. Usually Southwest's terminals have banks of comfy seats with outlets built in but I guess they passed over McCarran. . . The airport just has a sense of grubbiness about it, like it's not quite cleaned as often as it needs to be. For a city that prides itself on its glamorous entertainment complexes, the airport could use a bit of a pick-me-up.
The glaring problem with McCarran International Airport is not enough electrical outlets. One can frequently see LOTS of people sitting on the floor of the airport, clustered around one electrical outlet. I've done it myself. Overall, the airport seems a bit dirty or old. I understand, a lot of people going through there. But, I've seen busier airports much cleaner. Pretty good eating options. Overall, it's okay.
I've flown in and out of here many times and I'm amazed at how smooth this place runs with how much traffic comes through each day.  The parking is easy and fast.  The layout makes it easy to get from your ticketing to your gate.  The gate security is always fast and I've never had a bad experience with any TSA agent here.  After you arrive the luggage is usually ready for you to pick up in the matter of minutes.  Just a well run airport.
Location, Location, Location!  That's what it's about playa!  No 30 minute drives to the middle of no where from the airport.. Slot machines in the airport, clean.  Be aware of the long waits through TSAs especially during huge events and holiday weekends.
I've been fortunate enough to have traveled a considerable amount over the years, and seeing how this is my third trip to Vegas this year, I suppose a review is overdue.. . Aside from the slot machines stuck in about every location they could find, LAS is a pretty typical big-city airport, meaning:. -rental car counter is offsite and requires a 10 minute shuttle bus ride. -TSA security lines can back up during peak times. I've been told Tuesday and Saturday are the lowest volume days, although during the morning and afternoon bank, you're screwed either way. Get to the airport early. . -TSA Pre-Check lines are at all of the gates and terminals. I flew USAirways out of a Terminal 1 D Concourse, and I had to look really hard for it. If you're enrolled in it, you understand the reason you look. #keepyourshoeson #keepyourbagpacked #totsllyworthit. -Unless you're flying on Southwest, prepare to take a monorail to your gate. Don't quote me on this, but I seem to think the last time I was here on Southwest, I didn't have to ride the rail. . -There are multiple food locations scattered through the airport. They do a good Jon of making sure there's a Starbucks in sight throughout your entire visit.
Airport? More like struggle bus. . . It's a struggle to go from one terminal to the next. . It's a struggle to keep your nose closed (it's quite stinky.). It's a struggle to find charging outlets.. And, quite frankly, it's a struggle to even look at.. The bathrooms = struggle.. Ya, there are loud slot machines. Ya, there's an Einstein Bagel. Ya, I try to avoid layovers here! Talk to my husband who is currently playing the Wheel of Fortune slot machine later. If he wins some of dat cash money, I might bump to 3 stars.
45 min long line to catch a cab!! Man, I would have taken local transport to make it faster to the hotel. It was a Friday night in a party city. But, still there should be better management from the airport security people to catch a cab. More lines or more entry points for anyone who wants to get a taxi.
McCarran International Airport is about less than a mile a way from the strip hotels so the taxi ride should costs you between $15-$20. This airport is probably the only one that has slot machines and it was first thing I've noticed when I stepped off the plane and into the terminal. I just wish they are not in the area where people wait to board their flights as I find these slot machines in the way and taking up more space than usual.. . This airport is clean and well-managed. Not too confusing to navigate around. I hope they upgrade this airport to look more fancy so it matches the rest of Vegas and also upgrade their AC system because it's always hot inside this airport due to many people and the hot weather of course.
Efficient, but come early to account for Tram ride.. . I would have given this airport 2 stars, but I like this airport because of the slot machines and people watching experience. I wish they had some table games, but slot machines will do for my gambling problems. It's a fun (and expensive) way to kill time and waste money because your Delta flight is late again. . . People watching here is phenomenal. You have your Japanese tour group, your midwest country bumpkins, some wannabe gangbangers, high executive CEOs, hungover frat boys, girls doing the walk (or run) of shame to get to their gate, etc. There's such a wide range of people that fly thru here. . . With that said, there's a good amount of inexperienced travelers that will hold up the TSA security line. I wish they would add more lines to accommodate the crowd. Taxi lines are horrendous and could take up to an hour of waiting. The tram can get crowded to and for some reason, when you are running late, you will always "just missed it". . . Overall this airport is just okay. It's too busy for my taste, but it is fun to fly out of once in a while. Make sure you are not late if you are flying out on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday. Flights are generally all sold out leaving Las Vegas.
Can it be any easier? drop off car, shuttle to airport, train to terminal, elevator to tsa gates, viola!  Great, streamlined, efficient, organized airport. I have to wonder if we have the broke n hung over folks to thank for this streamlined airport...LOL. Good job McCarran - Clean, great bathrooms and service areas. Vendors are a bit proud of their goods, but hey- that's what happens at the airport. 12.00 for a bear claw and a cup of  milk. 4.00 for a coke..... yep, very proud indeed. Big shout out to the guys who operate the shuttles. Spot on help with luggage, courteous, and friendly.
I don't like airports in general, but McCarran is one of the worst I've been through.. . I was traveling with my elderly grandparents and my grandmother required a wheelchair to get around. When I got them checked in at the desk, they pointed me to where the wheelchairs were and a group of airport employees. I was going to push the wheelchair but one of the employees said I wasn't allowed to and proceeded to wheel my grandmother towards the security checkpoint. I highly doubt there is a rule that says only airport employees can assist people in wheelchairs.. . The guy was walking too fast and my grandfather was having a hard time keeping pace. I asked the guy to slow down but he stopped for a brief second before continuing with the same speed. . . The security checkpoint was awful. At the airport we came from at the beginning of our trip, we were allowed to go through a separate security line with lighter security measures (we didn't have to take our shoes off, empty our bags of electronics, etc) because my grandmother was in a wheelchair and required an alternative security screening. At McCarran, we were pushed into the same line as everyone else because there was no separate line for wheelchair-bound people (or TSA approved people, for that matter). After going through the full-body scanner, the TSA agent searched everyone's pockets instead of just letting us move on.. . We had to wait almost 10 minutes after we got through the scanner because there wasn't a female TSA agent available to wheel my grandmother past the scanner and give her a alternative security screening. They just left her there in line until someone finally noticed and wheeled her across. They didn't even give her a pat-down; they just checked her for explosive residue with that chemical pad. . . The airport employee was still with us and insisted on wheeling my grandmother to the gate. Once again, he was walking too fast and my grandfather couldn't keep up. . . After waiting at the gate for around 30 minutes, an announcement came over the speakers about our flight but the volume was too low and the guy was speaking too fast so we couldn't understand what he said. Some of the other people waiting said that a different flight at our gate was delayed and apparently both planes were on their way here. We were told that we (as in, our flight) might be moved to a different gate. Our plane arrived first (and on time) but the gate people said the other flight's passengers were going to take this one and we had to go to a different gate on the other side of the terminal. So we walked over 15 gates down to where we were suppose to go. What pissed me off was that their plane was delayed and they got to swipe ours instead. Then they got to take off and we were delayed too. . . When we were boarding the plane the gate employees wouldn't let me board with my grandparents because I wasn't on the pre-board list. I expected as much, but they were really nasty about how they said "no". Usually, airports let a small number of people board with the person who is in pre-boarding (wheelchair-bound people, infants, people with disabilities, etc) but I guess McCarran employees treat you like a jackass for "trying to get on the plane early and cut in line". . . I always hear about TSA agents and airport employees claiming to be the ones under all the stress and that the passengers are being unfair bullies, but maybe if they didn't treat everyone like a security risk or an incompetent moron, the passengers won't be so ticked off at the airport.
This is a decent airport. We had no issues during our 2 hour wait prior to boarding our plane to go home. Plenty of food options and bars to kill some time (they're all overpriced, but that's the case in all airports). . . Security was fast (probably about 2minutes to get through), and nothing seemed overcrowded. . . Obviously no one should be playing the slot machines in the airport, as their payouts are even worse than in Vegas / on the strip. Yet there's always people sitting there giving away their money into the machines. Oh well.
What I don't think people realize is since vegas is a touristy city the airport is going to be crazy. This is one of the busiest airports in the country and they still have great coordination and direction. This airport is easy to navigate through and there are plenty of bathrooms. There are so many choices of restaurants/food establishments and gift shops. When people write reviews about it being swamped with people and crazy and rate it a low star bcs it's "too crowded"... Duh !
Nice airport, busy though, super long walk..
Great shops and restaurants while you wait. The check in is not too bad either, pretty standard. I love the slot machines in the airport too, no craps tables... oh well.
Haha, can't really complain about this place. Energy levels are super high and everybody is amped up when you land and are ready to party in Vegas...the exact opposite occurs for your departing flight back home.. . Food wise, it's mostly chain restaurants and it's not THAT overpriced compared to other airports I been to.. . Just some random tips... . -About $20-$30 cab ride FROM THE AIRPORT TO STRIP...about $20 FROM THE STRIP TO THE AIRPORT. . -If you have a car rental, there is a shuttle that takes you to an off-site station. So give yourself some extra time!. . -Lots of walking...yep, LONG walks trying to get to the different terminals and gates.. . -You will probably get lost from the baggage claim area. They have separate exits for cabs, limos, shuttles, pickup.
Coming here and leaving is probably fine but having to wait for a connecting flight ...? Terrible. Hot, crowded, old... plus huge walkways that lead to the other terminals take FOREVER to navigate. The signage is misleading as well. Surprisingly not many good options for eating, at least in some terminals. Overall I could not WAIT to escape from this place
Just moved to the area and it's a 15 minute walk to my place. And the shuttle takes me to my job @ rental center. How AWESOME is that?
I really don't like this airport. I avoid it when I can and dip through it when it's necessary. I spent $20 on a hamburger once that was not that great. I guess I burned off the burger while walking because the terminals are so far apart! I was sweating and panting by the time I got to my gate and although I had a two hour layover, I didn't move from that spot because I knew it would take me that long to find a water fountain in this place. And come on? You really can't wait to get out of the airport to gamble?! You lose all your money anyway! Go buy some $43 chocolates and call it a day.
Not the best airport, but not the worst. The check-in lines were insanely long, and it took me almost an hour just to check in, but the security lines were incredibly short. Probably not the fault of the airport but of the airlines themselves, but I was starting to sweat when my flight was quickly approaching. Luckily my flight was delayed a half hour, so I got in with no problems.. . Unfortunately, ever since I turned twenty one, I end up at this airport a lot since I travel to Vegas quite a bit. The free wi-fi is definitely a huge plus, though the slot machines in the terminals are very tacky and take up a lot of floor space. I also discovered that there was a serious lack of power outlets, and my phone almost died before my flight. . . I do enjoy the tram that runs between terminals, even though the people who use it seem to not understand how to embark/disembark the vehicles. Please people...do not stand RIGHT in the doorway, and please stand to the side until the cars have cleared of people. I've had to shove people aside who don't seem to understand public transportation etiquette. Sorry, pet peeve rant over.. . Food is mostly chain places, but a good selection and most of the places are open late. This makes it nice if you have a red-eye flight, and want to get a cup of coffee or a sandwich before taking off for a long flight. . . Cabs are affordable, and only about twenty to thirty dollars to the strip. Parking is plentiful, and the pick up area is easy to locate.
City of Lights? ??. Does not provide wall sockets. For all the visiting guest to charge devices. . . I would expect this from a 3rd world country, what are they thinking? . . Trying to save some power, by not providing a good service to paying guest. . . Am I in the USA?. How is it possible that a Dinky airport like Sacramento . . Blows Las Vegas out of the water?
Pretty good airport, easy to navigate. Security can be busy at times when you wouldn't expect it to be though. You can also gamble right into the airport and lose all your money before you make it to casinos.
As much as I would want to love this airport being a Las Vegas native, I can't.. . Granted, Vegas is still growing up comparing to other cities that are more established, it's still one of the busiest airports in the United States. And with that reason alone, there should have been more thought out plans considering the amount of people that are visiting every year. . . The baggage claim GRINDS MY GEARS every time. It's insanely slow. Be prepared to wait awhile for your luggage to come around. I've been to numerous airports, even third-world ones abroad and never dealt with a delay such as McCarran's.. . The airport is clean and modern, I'll give them that. Especially the new terminal they added on but there's little to do there since every place closes quite early considering it being Vegas, where places are open 24/7.. . And the staff? Very slow paced as if I'm on lortabs or something. There's no energy throughout the airport making people uneasy to wait for their flight to get the F out of the airport.. . And one more thing. BUILD A BRIDGE THAT ALLOWS PATRONS TO WALK ACROSS TO THE PASSENGER PICK UP AREA. I'm tired of heavy traffic being the person that's responsible to scoop someone up. It's irritating. And stupid.. . Vegas, I know you're better than this. The airport is the first impression people get on a city. Don't ruin it for them.
The McCarran International Airport is unfortunately a mix of pretty negative things and some pretty nice things which make for a slightly below-average airport experience.. . Let's start with the good things first:. 1) This airport has a lot of slot machines. if you like to gamble, there are at least 200 separate machines for you to enjoy.. 2) There is a very wide variety of shops and eateries in closely spaced areas. For example, there is a Coffee Bean about 35 feet from a Starbucks. The food court in the early-C terminal has a Burger King, Sabarro, a Mexican restaurant, and some takeout place.. 3) If you like people watching, this is your airport. I don't think you can find a wider mix of people than in this airport.. 4) There is free WiFi that you don't have to jump through too many hoops to use!  I'm on it right now and it's working great.. . Now let's move to the bad things:. 1) This airport has a lot of slot machines. They are loud. They are bright. They take up tons of room.If you're not a gambler, this will be the first thing that you notice when you're trying to take a nap.. 2) Like most other airports except for John Wayne in Orange County, all the food is overpriced because they know you're trapped here.  Imagine paying $8 for a vegetarian Burger King burger.  I'm not exaggerating. I spent $12 on 3 small pork tacos.. 3) Because this is a desert (and all airports don't want to lose money) the water pressure here is atrocious. I spent a full 40+ seconds trying to wash the guacamole sauce (from my $4 mini-tacos) off my hands.. 4) For obvious reasons, this airport attracts the type of people that you wouldn't want noticing that you leave your wallet pocket unbuttoned.. 5) There are only small designated "recharge" stations where you can plug in your laptop and such and they are always occupied because..... 6) This airport is very crowded. Don't expect a peaceful experience, but thankfully there is a fair amount of seating.
Looks like a cross between an old run down casino and an old run down bowling alley. The carpet is... Interesting... The layout is annoying and slot machines everywhere. I understand this is Vegas, but if you just can't resist airport slots, you probably have a problem. The airport is nicer than LGA, but that's about it...
