We would NEVER stay at "Encore" again!  The rooms were not overly luxurious (for the price we expected much more!), we didn't find ANY restaurant (including Allegro, the Buffet) that was even GOOD - let alone EXCELLENT - and all were way, way, way overpriced!  Drinks at the pool were watered down and $20/each!  Waitress service at the pool was S.....L,,,,,,O,,,,,,,W!!!!  AND, when we complained all we got was "sorry."  NOT. GOOD. ENOUGH!
Excellent resort... Very clean and the best part the rooms nor the restaurants  smell like cigarette smoke!!! Amazing restaurants n shopping center LE REVe great show, pool cabanas are stunning truly no need to even step out into the strip...great place to just relax Highly recommended!!!
The hotel itself was amazing. The decor beautiful, room nice and big with a even bigger beautiful luxurious bathroom. The beds feel like your sleeping on a cloud. And very convenient for those going to the club XS to see Diplo like we did. . But there was a huge fault in this perfect stay. The room was paid for as a gift and all I had to do was put a $150 deposit which would be returned minus $28 for resort fees in 4 days sense I used my ATM. I only stayed for 1 night but they took for the first day $150 as expected then the next day $179 and then another charge for $270. For what reason I still have no clue sensethe room had already been paid for. All of the charges got refunded one at a time after the 4 days but sense it was my ATM account it messed with all of my bills sense it was right at rent time. . So sense they took that money out for no reason I did not have enough in my account at the time for a couple of bills to go threw and was charged late fees. Thanks ENCORE!!!. So be careful and make sure to check your charges for they might pull a fast one on you. It's not the first time either for something similar happen to a friend of mine. . Don't think I will go back and stay there for the fear they will mess up my bank again.
Why are we paying a 25 dollar resort fee a night, when the wifi didn't work the whole time we were there, and we couldn't get any 4g service!? . . I love the Encore hotel because of its amenities, the pools, the decor, the ambiance and its close proximity to Tacos El Gordo, Encore Beach Club, and XS! But it's such a hassle to go anywhere else as you're at the end of the strip! So factor in the amount of cab rides you will have to take if you want to go places.. . I will say that the staff was helpful, but not overly nice. In fact they have a pretty strict dress code here and they did ask people to leave if you weren't dressed accordingly. . . We stayed on the 54th floor, and had a gorgeous view of the strip, the rooms were amazingly large, and perfect because we asked for connecting rooms (upcharge of 30 dollars a night). . . Overall it was a great stay, but the lack of late night food places and food places in the hotel in general, would be reason enough to find somewhere else that's more poppin'.
Came to town to celebrate our anniversary and see Celine Dion. Our experience at the Encore was top drawer. The rooms are terrific with panoramic floor to ceiling views. We dined at Sinatra and the Point Cafe poolside for breakfast. The staff are terrific. Rebecca at the concierge desk tracked down some bud vases we admired at Sinatra"s and made it a point to get us two of them before we left. We've travelled the world and stayed in some marvelous hotels. The Encore is now in our top ten.
Stayed at the Encore last weekend. Overall had a great time. The staff was nice and the dealers and the cocktail girls were very pleasant as well. The reason for the four star review is actually two reasons.. .  . . 1) When we asked for an upgrade upon arrival, they offered us a Panoramic View room at a "promotion rate". We went for it thinking that the upgrade will give us a better view from our room. Once we entered the room, the view was of a construction site and an empty huge parking lot. I do not consider this an upgrade, but rather the opposite. I didn't want to switch rooms as I was there not to stare outside the window and just wanted to get to enjoying Vegas. However, I did feel that we were taken for fools and were privately laughed at once we left the check in counter. This is definitely not something I would expect from Wynn. My advice is ask them specifically what the room view is and check the room first before telling them to bring up your luggage.. .  . . 2) Having paid $300 per night, you would expect that you would get certain perks for being a valued guest of the hotel. My specific issue is going to a night club. We got bottle service the first night and it was a painless experience. However, the second night around, we wanted to stop by a different club for an hour or two of dancing and drinking and then head on to gamble for the rest of the night. I noticed from the night before that there was a line to get in to the club unless you were on a guest list or got bottle service. I went to the concierge to ask them to put us on a guest list to skip the line. The concierge told us there is a fee per person. The men are $55 and women a bit less. This was a big surprise for me.  Again, having paid a premium for the room, I would think that I would get the privilege of being able to enter the club without having to wait in line with people coming from other hotels who paid half the price for their rooms.  Apparently that's not the case which was very disappointing.. .  . . Everything else on the other hand was excellent. The food was great as usual, the pool grounds were clean, and the hotel still maintains a great appearance.
The best of the best in Vegas. The spacious rooms, restaurants, clubs, & Encore Beach Club are all top of the line. My only complaint is $30 for a drink was a tad too high -at least it was a double!!
Came to the Encore Hotel not by choice. The rooms were beautiful and had s great view. The only people that seemed to be nice were the housekeepers and front desk clerk when checking in. Since I never stayed here I didn't know the amenities like hours of operation with Red Card, perks guests get particularly at nightclubs inside the hotel. I missed everything! As expensive as this hotel was I would have thought the staff or something could have helped me understand the perks guests get for staying at their hotel. Then we eat at the restaurant and get charged a gratuity when the receipt clearly mentions it would be added to a party of 7 or more.......the problem with that is it was only 6 if us! I was able to earn points on my red card but when I tried to cash it in for additional credits, they were closed. If I would have known if seen hours if operation, I would have gambled a little but earlier in the day! I will not be back to this expensive hotel where I would have to pay an additional fee just to use the internet...wth? Doesn't this hotel get enough money?
Excellent room, great employees, and nice gym. Warning: if you will be going to bed before 4am, please ask for room facing the strip as the other rooms face the pool and the encore beach club that is opened all night? The music and base noise can be heard from our 9th floor room. Even worse were our neighbors who were smoking pot on non smoking floor who kept us up til 5am. We asked for room switch and initially were told no rooms were available. Hours later, the encore came through with a new room facing the strip and normal neighbors. Our keys were reprogrammed in seconds and we grabbed our stuff and went right to new room. Never had to go downstairs to check out. The process was amazingly quick and we thought it was customer service at its best. The employees there made you feel like royalty and truly worth commending. We will surely come back and stay here again. Only negative thing is you have to walk to the wynn for almost everything including poker room, buffet, and sports book.
I would give zero stars if I could. . . If you serve food that will make someone sick and ruin their vacation at least own up to it. Both our nannies got sick after having their tuna salad sandwich. So you can imagine how horrible this situation was. We are taking the kids with our help and ended up attending to them because they got served bad food. Then the management says there is nothing they can do about it. What a joke. We stay at this resort 2 to 3 times a year. This is not the way to treat a client.
Their service is pretty bad! We have asked for extra towels. And tissue paper and we paid extra tip and didn't receive anything! This is the first time I have been to a hotel that doesn't provide what u ask... This hotel is far from everything. If u want a quiet boring time in vegas stay here w over rates pricing. Restaurants Are not bad.. The front desk girl we checked in Laila was rude as hell! We will never come back to this hotel! Worse experience ever
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! DO NOT!. . Let me start by saying the staff are polite and courteous, on point, from the concierge to the dealers.  Now that this is out of the way lets get into how the stay was.. . My buddy, his girlfriend and I stayed this past Friday and Saturday night (08/16/2014-10/08/2014).  We booked a Tower suite for $450.00 a night.. . When we arrived at the hotel the computers we're down and they were having trouble checking people in.  This is understandable, computers are finicky, especially with large complicated servers that this hotel/casino must have.  The least you could do is give out a small room comp for the wait, breakfast maybe?  Or ATLEAST inform us that we should check in at the Tower concierge instead of coming back twice to find out we could have checked in the whole time!. . While checking in we we're informed that our late checkout, free breakfast, hotel credit and guaranteed upgrade we we're promised upon booking we're not going to happen.  Again, not so much as a comp to make up for this.  We also requested a roll away bed, "no problem sir.".  1 hour later we call for the roll away as it hasn't showed up.  AGAIN 1 hour after this we call again.  We didn't see that role away the WHOLE trip, it never came.. . Moving on.  The "Tower King Suite", IS TINY.  $450 a night!! C'mon Steve.. . We we're not going to let this nonsense get us down, this is Vegas baby, and we're here, so lets have some fun.  Over the course of the weekend I spent a hair over 6 grand on the room, drinks, food and gambling.  You would be hard pressed to say I was a bad customer to the hotel.. . Upon checkout, I come to find that my supposed "players card" had no gambling time on it and that there was, "nothing they could do".. . You come to Vegas to party hard and be treated like royalty, especially when dropping 6 grand at the "Nicest" hotel in Vegas while staying in a Tower Suite, especially being former Marine Corps.. . Steve Wynn, you owe me my money and time.  Disgraceful.
Loud, Loud, Loud! 34th floor and the windows are shaking. They "upgraded" us to a panoramic view but they actually gave us tickets to a electronic night club. It's our 4th time here, but, this is our last. It was once the hotel with the most class but now it is just another night club hotel where you can't sleep. The noise is so loud. For over $200 a night it is not worth it.
I love the layout of the room, and how the sofas are actually REALLY comfortable to sleep on! Their spa/fitness level is so luxurious as well, and staff throughout the hotel is very hospitable. Toiletries are nice (Bambu), however I found their late night room service options to be lacking and the wait time is ridiculous (1 hour+).
Great hotel rooms!  The bathroom is spacious with a vanity area, dual sinks, walk in shower, and tub.  The room I stayed in had a king bed and couch suitable for sleeping space.  The room felt like a loft with the bedroom and living room/office area separated only by an open wall with a swivel flat screen tv.  The wall length windows provided a beautiful view with the remote control operated curtains.  The staff are friendly and the hotel/casino is kept clean and classy.  The casino was a little sparse with games, but it wasn't too overwhelming. So if you want to play, eat, and stay in Vegas, then get on your feet and clap your hands for the Encore!
wow... what happened ENCORE???. . you guys hit rock bottom within a matter of months ! I've made it a point to only stay at the Encore the past several years and i think this may have been my last?. . it took 30 minutes to check in (not waiting in line - at the counter!). . 30 minutes for the front desk guy to check ID, and he kept going in and out of the backroom - only to tell us that our room wasnt ready yet and that he will text us at 3 when the room is ready. . 4:00pm - still no txt.  we had to wait in that god awful check in line again for another 20 min to get our room.. . the lack of cocktail service was ridiculous even the pitbosses got upset. then the cocktail waitress argued and lied saying she was serving us all day. huh??? then told us not to move around? uh hello???? its not like we're going from casino to casino! we are moving over one table!!!! and if you were quicker we wouldnt be at a different table! . . worst service ever on a weekend. very disappointed.
Really nice hotel, great casino food etc. In terms of cleanliness and room service NOT so great. But overall good.
Great hotel. Beautiful view. The only thing I didn't like about it is that the use of the refrigerator is chargeable.. I was really surprised coz I didn't wanna use any of the items in their refregerator. I just wanted to put my own items in it. I think it's too much. I 've been to a lot of 5 stars hotels and none of them charged me for the use of the refrigerator.
Price - 4 stars - We paid $132 + Resort Fee per day.  For this price, I have to say the room is very spacious in comparison to other places I've stayed at.  The room came with free internet access for two devices and free domestic calls.  This may seem unneccessary when everyone has a cell phone, however, we have T-Mobile and Verizon, to my dismay, both carriers had very poor reception in the hotel.. . View - 4 stars - Our room had a partial view of the hotel swimming pool and the airport.  Yes, THAT feature kept the younglings entertained for hours watching the aircrafts during TToL.  At night, there was a good nigh time light view.. . Environment - 3 stars - Overall, I'd say the room is not bad.  The layout gives it a serene feeling, however, the sound barrier between rooms is rather poor.  Our next door neighbor woke us up at 6am shouting and screaming for 30 minutes with a 5 minutes break in between another 30 minutes round of shouting.  . . Staff - 4 stars - We had limited staff interface since we stayed for two nights, thus, didn't ask the staff to come clean the room.  The only interface we had was during check-in.  The front desk reception was helpful and advised us due to our room's location, the night club sound may be loud.. . Cleaniness - 3 stars - I gave it a three stars rating because the shower had multiple mold spots which I was not impressed.  No, we did not call Housekeeping to come clean it because I know harsh chemicals would have been used in order to remove it.  Other than the mold in the shower, everything else was fine.. . Amenities - 3 stars - The exercise room closes at 8pm.  I know, I know - Who comes to Vegas to work out?  After a long day of walking around and buffet bingeing, we simply wanted a place to stretch those muscles.  So, I say 8pm was way too early!
Stayed here and Palazzo in the same trip. My wife and I both liked the Palazzo much better! Better food choices by far with reasonable prices and open late. Rooms are huge and comfy and the pools are outstanding at both places! If you can't make up your mind, choose Palazzo! We are alsoa tad older (age 50) and the crowd here was flashier, high maintenance, 20 something's. I liked it but the wife felt she just didn't fit in. . Side note- The machines here are wound tighter than a clock. After you lose your first $200 and don't get the slightest reaction from any machine you will understand what I'm saying. We stopped gambling here because we spotted this almost immediately.  If you keep pumping in hundreds after reading this, don't say you weren't warned.
Great check in. Super nice staff. The rooms are gorgeous - king suite is our favorite. The best part is the shower - it becomes a steam room when the water is on high heat. :-) also GREAT little cafe at the bottom of tower with yummy coffee and easy great priced breakfast  - ok and then my next favorite is the gym :-) awesome equipment - so clean and modern !  We are not pool clubbing peeps, but we love the adult pool - seriously can't figure out a single complaint about this hotel :-)
