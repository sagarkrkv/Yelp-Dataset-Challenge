A very good middle of the road Brazilian M'eatery.  Located conveniently in Town Center.  A great place to catch up to that inner carnivorous primal foodie in you after a day of shopping or before you catch a film.  Opening the huge heavy doors they creek and it looks as though you've stepped into Dracula's mansion.  Very formal dark and brooding, just what you expect to see in a place that specializes in bringing tender dead animal meat carcasses from the fire to your fork.. . Tri-tip or whatever the house cut is called is perfection!  I skip the sausage.  Leave room for the bevy of flank, pork, lamb, bacon wrapped stuff and parm crusted chicken.  The leg of lamb was a bit tough last time but the chop was very tender.  . . The usuals are there at the salad bar.  Pick up some goat cheese, roasted garlic and chimichuri for your meats from there!  Standard fare not the worst Brazilian.  We first had it over a decade ago at Yollies.  Definitely better than them.  Give it shot.  Lunch is 30 bucks before 3.
I took my boyfriend here for his birthday today. I've been here many times before, but he hasnt. Jorge S. Our server was wonderful. He made it a great experience for my boyfriend. I highly recommend this place. You do have to be a meat lover though. Come in hungry. Its a lot of food.
Wouldn't let me use my Birthday certificate because it wouldn't load on my phone even though they saw I had an email from them and I had my ID proving it was my birthday.  It's sad that they would loose business from  someone who could bring so many people to their restaurant and BROUGHT so many people with them who spent a lot of money on drinks. Over $25? Pretty pathetic management if you ask me. My anniversary is next month and my dinner with bridesmaids and grooms men was going to be here. I think not. They are not the best in town anyway. I'll just take my business to the other Brazilian steakhouse which I just found on yelp that is not far from here.
Wow is what I said after experiencing this place. The guys were always at our table with selections of meat and when we would say no they would ask if there was anything particular we wanted! Super attentive and friendly. Everybody tracked down what we wanted and sent them to us, kept our drinks full, and were very straightforward how things went. Of course I think soft drinks should be included in the price and I understand why they would charge for desserts. Lots of smiles and steak I will be back!
Perfect place for a hungry carnivore. It really is that good. . First of all the restaurant itself is very nice and comfortable. The people that work there are all so friendly, and the place has an upbeat atmosphere.. This is an all you can eat place without the all you can eat bad food. Basically once you are seated the server explains the concept of the restaurant, and then you help yourself to the "salad bar". The salad bar isn't really what people would think of as a typical salad bar. It has so much variety of things you wouldn't normally see...quinoa, Peruvian salad, feijoada, shrimp, salmon to name a few.. Then comes the real food. Servers walk around with sword like skewers and ask if you would like to try what they have. Filet mignon, leg of lamb, beef rib, and my favorite picahna along with probably 6 or 7 more things to choose from. Everything is excellent. It is brought directly from the kitchen to the diners, and they have every temperature from rare to well done.. Oh one more thing that I almost forgot. The sangria is the best in town, its not just good it is the best, get a pitcher or 2.
Always a busy place and the food is great. The salad bar is a destination in itself. Great place to have a night out and food that tastes fresh and of good quality.
Texas de Brazil was delicious we had a wonderful time. We celebrated my wife's birthday with our 1 yr old son. I love the idea if being able to try different cuts of meat for what would be the price of 1 entree elsewhere. The leg of lamb, flank steak and the top sirloin are worth the price of admission. The bottles of wine are accessible at every price range. The atmosphere is slightly rowdy but it suited us fine as we had our son. We'll definatley return.
Quite possibly the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I have never received very good service at Texas De Brazil. The staff always seems rushed and the managers are always very, very rude. But my wife and I go back because we love the food (by far, the best food of any Brazilian steakhouse), and because I have worked in the service industry for half of my life and so I can deal with sub-par customer service. But the last time we dined here was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. The service was very sloppy but again, I know that there can be a number of reasons for this (issues with other tables, understaffing, etc). We told the server we were dining there for my wife's birthday (a late birthday dinner but still a birthday) and she did not even bother to wish her a happy birthday. Okay, no biggie. Then when we went to pay, we presented the server with a coupon that was emailed to my wife for a free dinner with an expiration date of 7/19/14 (we dined here on 6/24/14). It says right on the coupon that it is valid at dinner time but not on saturdays or holidays. This was a Thursday. The manager rudely said to us that they no longer accept these coupons. I asked him why they would send this to my wife then and he refused to listen to us and just waved us off as if he was too good for us. So I asked him for the phone number for the corporate office. He gave me this number but when I tried to explain to him why we were upset, he again brushed us off and told us that he didn't have time to listen and to call the corporate office. My wife was very insulted and it ruined her birthday. We definitely don't hunt for coupons when we go out to eat, but when we are emailed a coupon for a free dinner for a restaurant that we love, of course we will use it. I tipped the server 18% simply because of my experience in the service industry but I also told her that her Manager was very rude, to which she replied, "Yeah I know." So I called the corporate office and spoke with a woman there. She reiterated to me what the Manager had said that they no longer accept this coupon as it was from a third party. I just asked her why they would send out coupons if they will not redeem them. All she kept saying was that this was the policy and cut me off every time I tried to speak to her. I also explained that the Manager was very rude and disrespectful, to which she simply said that she "can't do anything about that." This is horrible customer service. My wife and I have spent thousands of dollars at Texas De Brazil restaurants in the past but this restaurant will not get another penny from us.
Great place! I would highly recommend it. Staff was friendly and the decor was nice. Do bring your appetite because it is a ton of food! I especially like the filet mignon, fried bananas and cheese bread. They have a huge salad bar with plenty of different things to try. I will definitely be going back.
Yum!. Go hungry!! It would be a shame to fill up before tasting all the wonderful meats coming around!. The buffet part has a pretty good selection, but frankly it's the meat that sets this place apart. . It's super expensive, but I'd still go back!
Came in for Brunch and made reservations.  Note, skip the salad bar to start and go directly to the meats to get the best value.  After 1 round of all the entrees then go back and hit the salad bar.  Food is consistently good and service is on point.  Good for groups, but be careful with softdrinks and cocktails.  They get pricey.
Excellent dinner and service!  Romantic atmosphere!! Can't wait to come back to Vegas to dine here again!!
Lots of great cuts of meat. Come hungry, personal favorites include house special sirloin and beef ribs. All awesome choices.
Simply the best! From the service to the amazing quality of meats and salad bar options! Highly recommended!
Me and my husband always decide to go here whenever we have a meat craving ( I'm not really a red meat kind of gal ). So we came here for my birthday! It was definitely worth it, for dinner it's around $50 a person, and people come around slicing meat for you. I have to say the service was really great on my birthday, I don't know if it was because on my open table reservation I mentioned it was my birthday or - they just love giving great service! My server was dead on with service, when he noticed my mother in law didn't have a plate for her meats, he grabbed her one, and water cups were never empty. Our server also asked if we had any meat requests, and sent them over right away. Of course I have to mention their salad bar, if you don't want too much meat - this is the place to hit up. There are assortment of things, sauces for your meat, and one of my favorites - their lobster bisque soup. Last but not least for dessert I got a birthday cheesecake, and my server put a candle on it! It was a nice dinner for my birthday, very pleased. :-)
Don't know what all the hype is about. Kinda pissed they didn't acknowledge my husbands bday. Not asking for anything free but the waiter could have written it on the check... Whatever places do for wow experiences. I not only told them when I made the reservation but also told the girl sitting us it was his bday. My husband is like a little kid on his bday. He likes to be acknowledged. Other than that the salad bar was fresh and good. That was pretty much the best part. The meat was average. The lamb chops were delicious and pretty much all I would eat. The crime brulee was hot on the top and cold on the bottom. It was almost frozen. No good. The drinks we ordered came out half way when we were done with our food. Won't be coming back here. Try Burtolucci in henderson. Great people, great service and great food. This place me think NOT.
Hot damn! This place is great!. . I've been to rodizio spots where all you get is meats, unlimited salad... and fries or rice with your meal. Bleh. Here, you have access to a plethora of other foods. Cheeses, salads, soups, sides, sushi; pretty much an entire buffet on its own s'all there. The staff was quite accommodating (we ate A LOT) and even brought out a free dessert for a birthday at the table (the dessert is HUGE too). Obviously the main player here is the meats and they do a great job with them. Some are bacon wrapped, crusted, stuffed or just plain ol beef, but regardless of preparations, they're all tender and filled with flavor. Even the sausage and ribs had an excellent smokey bite. Seriously, come here if you need a food coma. They give you a card so your server knows whether to fill your plate with the latest offering and I think our entire table had it turned to green for a good 90 min straight. Good times. Can't wait for round 2... (in 2015 when I'm not so full anymore). . . Bonus: Saw Flavor Flav in the houuussseee.
If you love meat, this is your place to go. They have fifteen cuts of pork, chicken, steak and sausages. They also have a over 50 item buffet of salad, potatoes, rice, sushi, veggies and more. Not to mention it's ALL you can EAT! Dessert is no included in the price but don't let that stop you; the cheesecake and pies are amazing! Yes it is one the expensive side $50+ a person. But it is well worth it!
First time visiting a Texas de Brazil an heard mixed reviews so kept an open mind to enjoy the experience. . I had booked a reservation via Open Table, 6pm an we arrived about 20 mins early and was seat within a few minutes. . The restaurant itself is spacious with high ceilings and a couple of smaller rooms towards the back for group type sitting. We actually were seated in one of the small room with 3 other tables of 4, but were the first to be in this room, later all tables were occupied. . Pedro was our server and as other reviews that experienced him were on point, this guy is very nice, knows the menu and always seems to be there when you needed something, thanks Pedro! . After ordering wine/drinks we took to the salad bar which is as described on there website. Lots of variety and toppings to make a hearty salad and a complete meal with the spicy sushi roll, smoked salmon and spicy shrimp offered. The Lobster bisque was good in taste but as someone else stated did not include any actual lobster meat which was a little disappointing. . I was careful not to over indulge in salad as the Meat is why I was here.. The first meat upon flipping on the Green/Go sign was the Brazilian Steak which was very good in flavor and cooked just right. Followed with top sirloin, and beef ribs all great within temperature as they guys are constantly walking around with the meat on long skewers. I quickly understood why some reviewers stated the meats were Salty, however, I found this to be more of the Seasonings used in Brazilian type flavoring and could be easily misunderstood as "salty" i personally enjoy the flavors. . I did find the Pork to be over cooked and dry and was the only meat I did not finish. The Lamb Leg and Lion were both good, although I felt the leg was a little more "gamey" but cooked well. . After all the meats, Top Sirloin and Brazilian steak got my vote!, even over the tasty bacon wrapped filets and little chicken drumsticks. . I was careful not to eat too much of the Garlic Mashed potatoes and bread, but the caramelized banana used to "cleanse" your pallet between meats was a desert in itself. .   . Desert concluded with carrot cake and Key Lime pie. Both very good and certainly enough to top us off in the full department. . I enjoyed Red wine on recommendation from Pedro which was spot on. . . Overall I would certainly return on occasion and with the email discounts they offer. . Only reason I did not rank 5 stars is because of the dried pork, and lobster bisque, at these prices everything needs to be spot on!
Just spent our 1st anniversary dinner here. I love this place and always will. If you sign up for their emails you almost always get an amazing offer like BOGO. Another perk!
