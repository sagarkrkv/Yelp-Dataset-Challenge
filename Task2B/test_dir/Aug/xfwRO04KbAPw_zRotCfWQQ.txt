I've been here a couple of times. Both times I've gotten fast & friendly service, even though both times the place was packed. Because of the staff, this might be the "Go to" Breakfast joint? Giant menu. The portion were very large & everything on all our plates came to the table hot(nothing was cold due to organization or lazy wait staff), the Flap Jack were huge. The only real negative, I have with this restaurant, is that they don't pan or griddle fry the potatoes, they cheat & deep fry them.
Not a real fan of this place. I have been here three times and I think it is a trendy money pit that has bleh food.
Funny, I don't remember checking in here for quite some time yet Yelp asked if I have been here and to write a review.  Yes, I've been here twice.  Once for breakfast with BF... but I never eat breakfast.  I ordered the smores coffee... sugar, caffeine and huge... I didn't even finish it and was wired out of my mind!. Ironically, the who schtick, at HH is the portion size and BF ordered something like bacon and eggs... looked like a IHOP plate.. . Second visit was ladies dinner group.  It was fun seeing the ridiculously sized portions arrive at the table and of course the selfies and mugging for the camera  with mountains of food.  I had fried green tomato sandwich with got cheese,  Blech.  Sounded good but execution failed.  I don't know about everyone else, but I thing fried green tomatoes should be soft inside and crunchy outside... these were just crunchy and under cooked and although I took most of it home, . . That being said, HH is really about the experience of the ridiculously huge portions (gotta feel sorry for the servers!) and it is usually fun.
Delicious food, with huge portions and nice atmosphere. Great place!
The food was really good and the portions very generous. The service was a little slow due to it being busy. It took a long time to get certain condiments that should have been readily available such as ketchup and butter.  The staff was friendly but they were a bit overwhelmed.
Good food great quantity and good service all in all really good place to go
Portions are huge! Get the chipotle chicken Benedict. You won't be disappointed!!!!
amazing food! really cool creations and combinations of food. the portions are HUGE! the staff is polite.  ... word to the wise, bring your appetite and a friend to share with
Very cool atmosphere and very polite staff, however I am not impressed with the food. We got The Basic- toast was very dry, eggs needed more flavor, coffee was WAY too strong. Perhaps I am too picky for my own good, however I feel that my $9 breakfast could've been more worth the money. . On a positive note, the crispy potatoes are very good and the sausage is AMAZING! They also have a full bar- perfect for the end of a long night spent partying.
3 words: Nom Nom Nom!!!!. . Their breakfast is killer! My friend and I came back from Red Rock ready to eat a horse. Fortunately when we got there, they sat us quickly and our food came almost as soon as we ordered! I love this place. The food is stellar and the service is out of this world. Just talking about it makes me hungry.
I was really looking forward to trying this place after seeing it years ago on Man V Food. I hate to say it but I was disappointed. First off its super crowded every time you go there (been there twice) and they don't take reservations. One good thing is they do have a bloody mary bar so at least you can drink while you wait but being severely hungover and standing around for 15+ minutes is never ideal. The portions here are HUGE so make sure to share with a friend or two, even if you normally eat a lot. Me and two others shared the Man V Food Special Benedict, Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. The presentation while huge was nice (and intimidating) but all in all the flavor just wasn't there. This is definitely a cool place to visit once in your life if just for the gigantic porportions and bloody mary bar but not top on my list taste wise.
Not a huge fan of this place. And Huge is what you get for portions. But each time that I gave this place a shot, no one in our party has been happy with the food. It really is flavorless. I have no plans to ever go back.
Good food, HUGE portions. Got a blueberry pancake plate and a waffle plate for 3 adults and one child. More than enough food. Good tasting food, very friendly and attentive service. Will give it another shot when I go to Vegas again.
Best breakfast place ever! It takes a while to be seated no matter what location you go to but that is because everyone wants to go there. It is so good!
GIANT PORTIONS!! . . The chicken and waffles are enough to feed a starving nation. And they are delicious. The sage tower which holds it together is so fragrant and gives a lovely taste to the friend chicken. Ask for extra maple syrup.
I could not believe that when you get a portion this huge that the quality could match. A truly awesome diner!!
Always love this place. Great food, awesome atmosphere! The wait can be long to call ahead of time, and you might want to consider sharing a dish with someone or just be prepared for left overs. . . .or accept that as a challenge! The Chicken and Waffles are pretty bomb.
AMAZING FOOD!  Huge portions & definitely one the best places in Vegas for some tasty & unique breakfast combinations, VERY reasonable pricing & food is just delicious for breakfast as wel!  DEF my new favorite breakfast spot in this ENTIRE area,  Thanks & hope to see more locations in the future.  Only downside I could mention is if your coming in during a busy part of the day, be prepared to wait a little, since they are slammed more often then not.  . The FOOD IS WELL WORTH THE LITTLE LONGER WAIT then other breakfast spots.  The fantastic food makesup for it, if u come in during a busy time.  . . Appreciate it & hope to see more locations in Vegas, like the Henderson area which would be PACKED NONSTOP!! :)
This place is a nice restaurant to try. It's one of those restaurant that is meant to go try once, but not necessarily a place to come back to. The plates are huge! I definitely recommend people to share their dished with the table because the portions are overwhelmingly big. As for the dishes, they are extremely unique in ingredients and they have great culinary presentation......In otherwards, they are a little pricy, but you'll at least get your money worth with the big portion. I'd categorize this place as a casual upperscale diner. Make sure you're prepared for the long wait to be seated because this place is packed!!! But once you're seated, the waiters are quiet to get orders around.
Best breakfast ever :)
Service was prompt. Food was good and the price was fair. Go hungry the portions are enormous.
A friend brought us here for dinner, and it was AMAZING!  The portions are huge, so plan to share.  Have you seen the pancakes on Uncle Buck?  The pancakes here are about that big.  My husband got a hamburger that had garlic mashed potatoes on it.  It was incredible.  Our friend got the vegetable risotto.  It was beautifully arranged on the plate and garnished nicely.  Everything tasted really good and the restaurant has nice ambiance.  They try to do the whole farm to table thing, so the food is fresh and it was pretty to look at.. . Next time we go, I plan to get the pot pie.  Someone had it at the table next to us, and it was bigger than a pie.
Great food and WoW do they give you a lot.. Thanks.
Keeping it simple: AMAZING!!!. The chicken pot pie can feed a small village. I looked under the shell half way thru and found to potatoes. Sneaky bastards in the kitchen. Regardless, the food is great.. The bad: their bathroom smells like sewage. Not the "someone prior took a monster dump", but literal sewage. Kind of made me loose my appetite.
Great service, great food!
I know people either love this place or hate it. I don't like it at all. Yes they have great portion sizes, but I was disappointed with my meal the two times I have been there. To each his own
Best chicken and waffles! Had great service for Candice the host. She rocks! Made the wait worth the wait! Great food Best service!
Decadent Vegas delicious!  Get the Hash or the Chicken and SPLIT IT! No need for separate meals here.  The Watermelon drink is tasty as well.
Really good chicken. I ate some of the chicken fried sage. The sauce was tasty with a spice my friends described as having a kick. The chicken was juicy and had crispiness. I liked it! . . Every dish here seems to be extra large. Share with a friend or 2.. . My friend got the s'more coffee drink which she said tasted good but she couldn't finish because it was so much. . . I wouldn't bother with other bfast foods you can get elsewhere. The bf wanted to go the healthier route and got waffles with eggs and sausage. It was ok. Get a dish with chicken. . . One last thing. The reason I deduct 1 star was that the server yesterday was so slow/inattentive and he only had our table and a small one to attend to. It took forever to get our check and pay.  Didn't fill our waters either. We noticed another server who was much more attentive. So don't let that server stop you from going. I think it is worth trying.
Great Salmon salad. The salmon was cooked to perfection. Servings are huge!  The kids enjoyed their Pancake and Mac n Cheese. Great atmosphere!. . Unfortunately, the service wasn't so amazing. Teresa, our server was pleasant. Once she brought us our food, the attention came to a halt. Luckily, we didn't require refills for our drinks. She dropped the check off early and tended to her other tables. We waited more than an extra 15 minutes until we finally waves her down to ask her for a TO-GO box. But once we stood up, the checkbook from our table was picked up quickly!
Portions are huge and delicious and always hits the spot!! No complaints!
I don't think you can go wrong with ANYTHING on the menu. everything looks absolutely delicious!!! I ended up getting the salmon eggs benedict and my fiance got the chicken and waffles. I LOOOOVED my dish. it was HUGE!!! I only ate half of it and had to bring the rest back. I would recommend coming here early, esepcially on weekends!!
Amazing food! Huge portions of food. Service was quick and efficient. We had the sage chicken.
Long wait, but great food.. I can't hold a grudge on our wait time, since I was one in a group of ten. We waited about 45 minutes and I will just consider that fair for a place that packed. . The food was simple, tastey, and so filling. Only one of our our ten finished a meal completely.. Also, booze in the morning with no judgement... which is nice.
Possibly the worst service in all restaurants in all of Las Vegas.  I do not know why but all of the servers there seem to have an attitude.  They are slow, discourteous and almost purposefully bitchy (guys and girls alike).  I have been there three times and after the third visit, I was convinced that it was like a game that was played by the servers - as if that was their "thing" - to be rude, slow and discourteous.  All in all its a very unpleasant experience and a location I would say NEVER GO TO!  I think that they will have to close down this location at some point because the rude behavior of the servers will alienate 90% of return customers.  The only reason why I went back for a second and third dinner was because the last two times the restaurant was already selected by a group of friends - so I had to go.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Make these people pay for their bad behavior and avoid this location.
Heard a lot about this place so I thought I'd try it for breakfast. S-l-o-w service and waited a long time for coffee. The $17 spinach,ham, cheese omelet was lukewarm when it arrived. Same with the first and refill coffee. Both were just warm. . Wait staff has that deer in the headlights look. Certainly not going to get a repeat visit from me.
Great food, like the Snickers pancakes.
Food was decent.  Extra large portions in exchange for higher prices. If you want to lay on the couch for the rest of the day after stuffing your face then this is your spot. Service was lacking.
My breakfast skillet tasted amazing!! They have special jam for your biscuits and it's absolutely delicious!! The portion amount is overflowing so you will need to get a take-home box!! Prices are great for what you get!! My new favorite breakfast spot!!
Arrogant and condescending.  They will not make any substitutions because (direct quote) "This is an award winning menu. The kitchen will not allow substitutions because it would change the flavor profile."   They serve chicken and waffles.  And pancakes.  And hamburgers.  Seriously.   "Change the flavor profile" with _this_ menu.  What colossal ego got put in charge of this place.... . They have plain plastic bottles of ketchup on the table, but only have cucumber ranch dressing.  Drinks are good, and come in cool leaning glasses. But don't ask for blended ice; they only use the blender the kitchen.  Decor is stainless steel, bolts and suspension cables, but every dish has a sprig of rosemary.  Music is a strange blend of 80s pop, jazz and reggae.  Often distracting.  Very confused identity.. . The food tastes good, and might be worth the price if you like eating leftovers. (The portions _are_ huge.)  It is definitely not worth being insulted and told what you can and cannot order.. . Five stars for good flavor and big portions.  Negative three (and I'm being kind) for the attitude.
Gluttony. Huge portions but the taste is just underwhelming.
