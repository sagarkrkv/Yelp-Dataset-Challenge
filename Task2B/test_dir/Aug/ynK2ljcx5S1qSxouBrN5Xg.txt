Never Again.  I got this place on Priceline last minute because hotels were so expensive and I just needed a place to crash.  . . BAD MOVE.  This place is terrible.. . It is super ghetto (interpret as you will) people roaming the halls extremely drunk.  Some guy was banging on my door in the middle of the night to come in.  I kept telling him to leave he was screaming.  I called security and they never came.  Then on the ride down the elevator in the morning there was puke on the floor and it wreaked. . . I have stayed at many hotels in vegas but this has to be the worst run ever.  Maybe someone else has a better experience to tell but my experience was so terrible I had to write a negative review.
Affordable hotel to stay in if staying with your college friends, but if you can afford to go to another one, go for it.. I stayed with three of my friends in a room of four (with two king-sized beds).. The service is unprofessional, especially the housekeeping department.. Doing just one of the two beds and forgetting to change the sheets? Shameful.. But stealing items and denying it cause "we don't have proof"? Unacceptable.. Just an honest review from a girl who never write some!
Ok so I stayed here for the weekend and I really feel like I should've rolled around town with my luggage. I got there early and had to pay an additional $30 for early check in and resort fees. Ok I get that but $30 is a bit extreme when people check in early all the time. I got to the "only" room available and instantly started praying because I felt it would ruin my weekend. They gave me a smoking room and it smelled so bad I got sick and couldn't breath. I went to my friends room and stayed there until it was time for us to go to dinner. When I went to the front desk I was told "Well ma'am that's what you paid for when you checked in early". I couldn't believe that. I only was able to be in my room a total of 2 hours a day. I spent $345 for a room I simply could not stay in. I had 3 other friends who stayed here and after going to their rooms I felt punked!! My room conditions were embarrassing to my friends. By the way I never got my room cleaned the whole three days so I went to cvs to buy towels and face towels. I was very surprised by this experience.
Price was ok I guess.... But that's about it. . Resort fee was a joke.. . Cockroaches were literally riding up the elevator with me.. . . Also make sure u avoid self parking at all costs. Because when your tires get slashed they will literally do nothing to help you.. Asking them to file a report is useless because they didn't get pictures of the slashed tires while they were on the car (sorry not trying to have the tires go flat while I wait on the Parking garage "security" to come take pics) spent $400 on new tires and the hotel said they can't do anything to reimburse us because it was self park.. Which is understandable... But then they state that they can't even look at the cameras and no one in the hotel has the authority to do so.. . We were not provided with a do not disturb sign (apparently just the top floors have those) so the maids walked in on us twice.. Luckily we were dressed. . . Started pouring rain....... And the ceiling in the hotel started leaking... Definently will spend the extra money to stay somewhere closer to the strip next time.
Where do I start??? The staff is rude, inconsiderate, and gives terrible directions as to where you need or want to go. It took us almost an hour to check in. There were 15 check in terminals at the counter,  and three attendants manning the counters...  After checking in, we decided we would further patronize the facility, and eat at their buffet (which was a BIG mistake!) After spending $50 for two to eat at their "magnificent" buffet, we discovered we could've had better food at McDonald's for a fraction of the price. The food was aged, no sea food to speak of, and what food we did end up eating- was very sub - par in quality.  VERY DISAPPOINTED! If you want a good Vegas experience,  stay and eat elsewhere!  They likely do have the best views around Vegas, but that's ALL the Stratosphere has going for it! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!
Don't go by the looks. Bad room (I had booked a premium room ). Shower in the room is a joke. Only positive thing is free tickets to Frankie's show. Definitely not coming back
Bad hotel. Don't waste time or money. I know now why they give great deals and then ask u to upgrade. Rooms are lousy, no coffee maker, bathroom are shabby. Rooms look like motel rooms. La Quinta inn does a better job than them. Disconnected from the strip. Poor. I don't know why I booked rooms with them. Smh..
Been this place for Rides and buffet. Rides are fun but buffet is the worst ever buffet i ever had in my whole life. Food is cold and smells bad. Never go to this place for buffet and area is also different and not nice. Better to stay around flamingo area
I had made a reservation specifically for a strip view room. When I got here I was offered a smoking room. I said that's not possible due to health issues. Then they offered me 1 bed despite there being a total of 3 people. . . Now I'm in a craptasric room "premiere"? Premiere what? Premiere Vegas a$$hole view? . . The least they could have done was upgraded my room. I would have accepted whatever view I had to take with a better room. . . Will never ever stay here again based off the crap customer service alone. The only reason I am staying is cause I had my credit card already on file and paid for some of my stay when I booked.. . ND - August 12 2014
Wir waren im August 2014 dort.. Ausschlaggebend war der Preis, der unglaublich gunstig war. Da ich im April 2013 bereits 2 Tage in diesem Hotel verbracht hatte, kannte ich die Zimmer und die verschiedenen Kategorien.. Durch den "20 Dollar-Trick" erhielten wir ein Top -Zimmer, das vor kurzer Zeit frisch renoviert worden war. Dieses Zimmer war super.. Das Casino selbst ist ziemlich unspektakular, aber zum Spielen gar nicht so schlecht. Super ist, dass der Eintrittspreis fur den unbegrenzten Zugang zum Turm im Zimmerpreis inbegriffen ist.. Im Casino gibt es unterschiedliche Gastronomie, vom Buffet uber ein 24 Stunden-Diner-Restaurant bis zu Starbucks etc. Sicherlich gibt es tollere Hotels in Vegas, aber fur eine Familie mit Kindern ist dieses sicherlich eine gute Wahl.. Die Parkgarage ist, wie in Vegas allgemein ublich, kostenlos. . Den Poolbereich hatten wir uns vorher im Internet bereits angeschaut und hatten leichte Bedenken, da dieser auf den Fotos im Allgemeinen nicht so schon aussieht. Diese Sorge war jedoch unbegrundet, da wir im Nachhinein den Pool sehr nett fanden. Im 8. Stock gelegen, gibt es dort naturlich nicht viele Baume etc. Aber es war wahrend unserer Zeit niemals uberfullt, sondern man fand immer eine ruhige Liege, was ich selbst in deutlich teureren Hotels in Vegas bereits wesentlich anders (uberfullt, dadurch ungemutlich) erlebt habe.
Not the best not the worst. Loved that the pool was cold when it was #110 out. Faucet was old and rusted. Lady wanted a ti ppl after she got auto 18% and a service charge. Buffett was soso but for $20 not bad at all. Some oeople were rude and pushy here. K ady was walking around tg he floi r banging silverware together. She looked like the manager. Super annoying.
I just got back from my first trip to the Stratosphere. I had a Select room and I totally loved the place!. . Just the right amount of crowded, outstanding service by everyone I encountered, and I didn't feel like I was constantly beingripped off like most other strip places. Played volleyball at the pool, ate at Roxy's (2x) and McCall's Heartland Grill...both had gluten free options for the wife too. Saw the Frankie Moreno show for free, which was one of the best show's I've seen. Lots of bars, restaurants, and stuff to do. Also the area outside the hotel was fine during the day, and will probably continue to get better when SLS and Walgreens opens.. . Strat has won a spot in my hotel rotation.
My review is strictly for the attraction at the top. Like Billy Idol in his song, "Blue Highway," I went to the top of the Stratosphere! I know, it's corny..... . For $20 a person, you can get a great view of Vegas. It's extra, if you dare to ride on the many hair raising attractions available. We came here early in the day and the wait wasn't too long. We went up over a hundred stories high and were let out at the indoor observation area. There, you can watch brave and adventurous people jump out onto the target. Very cool, but not my cup of tea. We climbed up another story and there's a roller coaster that plummets off the edge and hangs. There's also another coaster in which you just shoot straight up into the air. All very cool rides but I just came for the view. I later found out that I can return any time until they close. I didn't get a chance to return for the sun setting but glad I got the chance to see the view here!
For a basic hotel, I would give them 5 stars, but for an on-the-strip hotel and casino, particularly one that's connected to a landmark seen all over the city, I expected a bitmore.. . It wasn't a bad hotel room.  It was comfortable and clean, but it wasn't the type of room you'd expect to see in Vegas.  It was just like any holiday/days inn or even econo lodge.  . . It's also on the seedier side of the strip, which can make a lot of tourists uncomfortable.  I also a Vegas resident (sometimes), so I'm used to it.  But if you'd prefer to stay away from the underbelly of Vegas, go to the opposite end of the strip.. . All-in-all, if you have a strict budget and don't mind the area, get a room here. But if you're looking for a more Vegas-y experience and don't want to deal with the bad part of town, seek a room elsewhere.
Decent hotel to stay for a couple of nights. Rates are good. Went to their buffet for breakfast...ehhh just mediocre, gets the job done. The location- it is at the very beginning of the strip so be prepared with your walking shoes to get to middle of the strip or take a taxi. We stayed for 2 nights and took a taxi for a total of 4 times (15 bucks each way) probably could have used our taxi money and stayed at a hotel in the middle of the strip but that's okay we had a good time! If you book a room here you get unlimited trips to the tower that has a gorgeous view of the city!
Check-in was a quick process. Was upgraded to a high roller room. The phone didn't work, but eh I've got a cell phone. Hotel was nice. There was a $5 blackjack table :-) The pool was very nice and kid friendly. One thing that I would improve on though is when I ordered drinks by the pool, first they said they would take the coupon for 1 free drink, then once drinks were ordered, they said they wouldn't. At that point the drinks were already being drunk, then the computer was down so we couldn't charge it to the room. At that point the drinks were already half way gone. Who carries cash anymore (especially at the pool) at the end of it all, they took the almost finished drinks back. Was kinda lame...
Worst room ever so far in my life. We paid $100/- night and still got the lowest floor (5th) n wall facing view. Horrible experience during check-in. I will NOT suggest or Recommend anyone this hotel.
Steakhouse is set on level 107. It's around 800 feet towering above the strip and.... It rotates at a full spin every half an hour. Sitting near the outer rim can take some acclimation to the movement but it makes the steak house interesting. The Italian restaurant Fellini's has a cool atmosphere. The food has good size portions and was tasty. Warm service, good food, and I left satisfied. McCalls is the newest edition. Large menu and big variety. Usually fast service but I'd imagine it could get busy. Portions are actually small here. Roxy's diner is just that. A fast paced fun diner that actually has a server that sings... And sings good. Old Marlon Brando and Elvis movies play on the screen. Nightly show called pinup features Claire Sinclair who was playmate of the year in 2011. It's a variety show based on the months of the year. A 'calendar girl'. Impressive music performed live and even included in some of the performance. Talented dancers that display their special talents in different ways throughout the two hourshow. Top of the world also has rides, a bar, and a carver station. Rooms are fair but depending on your neighbors, can be hard to relax unless that's what you want. Parking is good. Location is set just in between downtown and the strip and the clientele is just that...A mix of locals and tourists.. . Shortly after writing this review, I attended a special labor day weekend meet and greet with the cast of pinup after seeing the show. I was actually having a very bad week but that party at the club 107 was ahhhhmazing. I had such a good time that I went to pinup again the very next night.
