Best. Steak. Ever. . You pay for it, but that's expected at a high class restaurant. . Service is exceptional... Food is off the chart!!. Would definitely return when I'm back in town.
Food was excellent!!!!  The favorites of our group were lobster, ribeye, filet, rack of lamb.  Salmon was a bit dry and halibut was just ok, but fine.  My personal standout for the many sides we got was the potatoes au gratin...I'm still dreaming!!!  Our service was just ok until the end when our server scolded someone in our group and said "sssshhhhh."   Really???  If he was ruining something for other customers (which I'm sure he wasn't--others tables were toasting with us) than a manager should've come up and said something, not her.  I mentioned to the hostess we were a lively group and to sit us accordingly.  She assured me it was not a problem.  We spent a lot of money and ended on a sour note--which is no bueno....it could've been handled so much better.  Also, they knew we were celebrating an anniversary and didn't bring a complimentary dessert??? (I think even Cheesecake Factory does that?).  It just seemed the waitress had a personality problem and didn't like us from the get go. Unfortunately, this is the second visit here where the service has fallen short.  Four stars for food.  Not in a hurry to go back.  There's no "sssshhhhh-ing in Vegas!"
UPDATE - . . Delmonico / Emeril's staff reached out to me via Yelp a couple of days after I posted the review, and I ended up having a good conversation with their Director of Operations in Las Vegas.  Mike told me he reviewed the events of the evening with the staff at Delmonico, including the mistakes that were made and ways to ensure it doesn't happen in the future.  He asked that I give them another chance and let him know when I'm going to be in Vegas again, which I most certainly will. . . I'm very impressed with their response and how they took the review as an opportunity to improve. . . ORIGINAL REVIEW - . . One of the worst high end Las Vegas restaurant experiences I've ever had.. . Dinner started out alright.  Larger party of 15, restaurant spread us across 2 tables instead of handling us as one; acceptable, but not thrilling. Initial greeting with menus and wine lists was prompt and fast. . . After that, follow up service to get drink orders and appetizers was very slow. Orders were finally taken and again, return to deliver the drinks took a while. . . When time came to order, my wife and I were among the first in the group.  I ordered a tableside Caesar for 2, a Special bone in filet medium rare for my wife and a special bone in filet blue (think less cooked than rare, if you don't know it) for myself. . . The pop-overs are fantastic, and the tableside Caesar was great. The gentleman who prepared it was kind enough to give me a couple of hints how they do the Caesar dressing which I'm looking forward to trying in my own Caesar dressing. . . At this point, the wheels came off the bus. I finished my glass of wine with the Caesar and tried repeatedly to signal our waiter John for another glass and failed. My wife got into trying to get his attention as well and failed multiple times before finally succeeding. . . Rough bus, meet out of control bus. Dinner arrives, and my wife and I are simultaneously served Bone In Ribeyes. Hers medium rare, mine blue (our order was Filets - medium rare and blue). We promptly object and are corrected at first by the waitstaff that we got what we ordered (we never order Ribeyes as we both like our steaks too rare for a ribeye's flavor to come out).. . The waiter comes over after some confusion and tells me he brought me what I ordered. After some quick discussion our incorrect steaks are removed and we're told our Special of the evening, Bone In Filets, are on their way. . . Not minutes later, we're told they've sold out of the special and we can have regular filets. Since the rest of our group has already been eating we just say fine, whatever, bring us a medium rare and a blue filet. . . Three different people drop by to apologize to us, a total of 8 times across them. Frankly it creeped us out a bit. . . When our new steaks finally arrived, they sat them down saying "here is your medium and rare filets".  When we cut in to them, we did get 1 medium and 1 rare filet but 0 medium rare and 0 blue filets. We just accepted them and went forth. . .  The flavor of the filets were good, as was the texture and seasoning. . . After the steak disaster, I did not have to struggle to get another glass of wine fortunately!!. . I can't say the side of grits with cheese and bacon was all that great since it sat there getting cold and congealing the whole time they were figuring out the steak issue. . . We passed on dessert, having lost all confidence on the restaurant. We did order a decaf coffee and a 10 year tawny port for me. The waiter offered to buy the port for me, i.e. comp it, but that seems a small consolation compared to blowing the whole main course in such an epic fashion. . . Can't recommend you avoid Delmonico enough. With so many other options around here, don't risk wasting your hard earned dollar (or luckily won one) here.
Pork Chops looked amazing although, I don't like pork chops... The guest who had them said one of the best they've EVER had... I ordered salad and the jumbalya- it was good, not fantastic...
I would give Delmonico a 2.5 or even more if it was available but as it's 2 or 3 unfortunately for them I have to go with 2. There were so many pluses for the meal that I feel bad about rating the restaurant low. However, the overall experience was not what I wanted, and for a  meal of this price I have pretty achievable expectations.. . For starters, the sevice was immaculate and I mean truly immaculate, the servers work as a team and they we're amazing. From recommending wines to full descriptions of food, and even drinks, they were aces. The wine list had so many rare and amazing finds that you could get lost searching, thankfully the staff was able to help us pick out one perfect for our tastes and meal. For the appetizer, bone in bacon, we'll if you didn't think it would be absolutely amazing by the name I can promise you, words do not describe how amazing this appetizer is. It truly is memorizing. Try it, and you'll understand. . . For dinner I had a filet and he had a bone in ribeye, their signature cut. Unfortunately  my husband had to send his steak back due to being substantially overlooked. Again, the waitstaff immediately addressed the issue and apologized agreeing with my husband that not only was the steak overlooked, but it was substantially overlooked, ie, the steak was ordered medium rare and came out between medium well and well.. . The waitstaff removed the steak from the table and after a few minutes brought my husband a second steak, most notable on the second steak was the fact that the steak butter was not melted, leading us to believe that the  steak was brought directly from the grill to the table, no time to rest under a lamp and overcook itself, a plus we thought. Until my husband cut into the second ribeye, again their signature steak, again substantially overlooked. At this point the server, who was speaking with my husband about the meal and appologizing about the previous steak appeared appalled that again, the steak was substantially overdone. He appeared embarrassed for the issues. We were promised no matter what it would be made up for and even the manager immediately addressed my husband and appeared completely appalled that the steak was so overdone, for a second time, (this time closer to medium well, maybe a high medium, but still nowhere near medium rare.) . . The manager and server traded apologies and promised to make things right. Due to the fact that I had only had half of my filet, my husband opted to not receive another ribeye, instead choosing to just finish my meal. The server and manager happily took the ribeye off and purchased us two desserts for the troubles and issues. . . For the good, the menu is amazing. In it's entirety, I believe it rivals some of the best steakhouses around. The lobster bisque is by far the best I've had, and as a fan of lobster bisque, I've had it at several 4 and 5 star restaurants all over the United States. Presentation, flavor, texture, everything was amazing. . . The bone in bacon, if I didn't convince you before, it is one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever had, the watermelon is a little strange sounding but brings out so much flavor that again, I just can't put it into words, you have to experience this dish!. . My filet oscar was great, perfectly cooked, very flavorful and perfectly seasoned. I just wish I had a second stomach to finish it after almost licking the plate of lobster bisque and bone in bacon. . . Desserts were great as everything else, and the after dinner drink list is as expansive as the wine list. If you can imagine it, they have it. . . My only issue is my husbands meal, again I feel bad because I understand mistakes happen, but it was very unfortuonate that for a dinner to celebrate our first annivarsary, at the end he/we were disappointed. He continued to describe it as "the food was amazing, but not what I was hoping for." . . I personally have issues with a $300 meal (granted $130 of it being an amazing and perfectly reccomended bottle of wine,) being disappointing in any way. Again mistakes happen and I believe firmly that they are rare at Delmonicos, but I cannot change this disappointing experience. . . If this is the only negative review that you read please do not discount this restaurant. Again, mistakes happen, and even as I write this, I feel bad for not giving the restaurant better ratings because so many things were good and accidents happen, but it doesn't change the experience tonight. Hopefully, as it appeared, this will be a rare experience and we may give this restaurant another shot the next time we're in Vegas, but as this was supposed to be a special meal celebrating, I will say disappointing is the best way to describe it. The restaurant has so much more potential and obviously could have done so much better than we experienced, we were just unlucky. Again, no fault on the waitstaff, they were amazing, but overall experience was disappointing. I hope others have better luck than we did.
2 stars for the great service!. . - 3 stars for all the food.... . The bone in ribeye was bland and overcooked.. The lobster was really chewy and fishy smelling.... The foie gras was good but I mean when is the liver of an specially fattened duck not good? . . For the $$$$ we spent I just expected so much more! . . Yelp...you let me down!
Over Priced!. All Entrees come A La Carte, basically with Nothing!. Waiters attitude not great!. Disappointed...
I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant while I was visiting Vegas with my fiance. We were staying at the Venetian and this location is conveniently located within the beautiful hotel so it was an easy choice for dinner. It is definitely nice not having to step outside of the AC when the average temperature outside is 115! . . I got the caesar salad to start and filet mignon for the main dish. Some of the side items we got were spinach, asparagus, wild mushrooms, and creamed corn gratinee. The main dishes do not come with sides so they are extra but the portions are large enough to share. . . I asked for my filet mignon to be medium rare and it was done perfectly. The steak was so tender and delicious! It was definitely one of the best steaks I have had. The sides complimented the meat nicely and everything single one of them were delicious. I wish I could comment on their deserts but we were both so full by the end of the meal that we decided to skip desert. This restaurant is a must if you are in Vegas!
Simply perfection. It is an experience well worth the price. Impeccable service, amazing wine list, phenomenal melt in your mouth filet mignon and strip steaks, mouth watering, delectable side dishes. In a city full of fantastic and amazing gastro experiences, THIS gem is in my top ten list rotation. Go, go go, be pampered and leave so satisfied!
Overall, I thought Delmonico was unimpressive given its rep and price point. I would suggest SW Steakhouse or Gordon Ramsay instead. . . Here's the salient-. . Service. The Staff was friendly enough but nothing special. There was a LOUD diner (really loud as I'm from NYC and used to noisy restaurants) and, despite my request, my server did not ask the guy to take it down a notch. . . Food. - The popovers, to start, were good but I was disappointed that no other bread was offered, which is usually the case with steakhouses.. - The word that comes to mind when describing the quality of the filet is mediocre. It looked like it had been pulverized with a meat mallet. Pretty bland and not juicy at all.. - My friend did enjoy his pork chop and it looked much better than my steak. . - The twice baked potato was a big disappointment given that the bottom of it felt rock hard and the whipped potato on top was bland.. - The fried apple pies were adequate. My friend really liked the pecan pie.
I came here for a bachelor party, and there were some mixed reviews in my crowd.  Most would give this place a 3-star review, but I thought that it deserved a 4-star review.. . Most in my crowd thought that the steaks were poorly decorated.  But I was not sure what they expected - steak is steak.  And my filet tasted well enough.  It was cooked well for a medium rare plus, which is hard to do.  So I was impressed enough.. . I also shared salmon with someone, but that definitely could have used more salt.  That surprised me considering that this is Emerald's restaurant, where butter and salt is what he *BAM!* loves.. . But I had some sides here that I thought were pretty amazing.  The buttered and gratin'd corn here is delicious.  My friends other hand, felt underwhelmed by their mushrooms and asparagus, which I guess I would have to tend to agree.. . They did have an excellent wine list, however.  I got some bottles of Shafer Relentless for less than double the retail price, which is a great deal considering that I was at an upper-end steakhouse.. . Lastly, what is noteworthy is that this tends to be a pretty good scene.  So not a bad place for a bachelor's party.
