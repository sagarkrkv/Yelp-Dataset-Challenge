I had heard all the possible hyperbole about Bianco being the best pizza in the world or at least the US. So when I got to SD on business I checked it out. Let me say that yes the pizza is good. Hard to say if it is the best pizza I have ever had and to be fair the owner does not promote this.. I like thin margarita style pizza and this is what i got. I am a big eater so I ordered two large as the pizza is so thin it isn't a whole lot of food or for me very filling.. I would say that the pizza is worth dining here. Will I go back? Probably if it is convenient. Pricy I spent $70.00 with tip for 2 large pies and a few beers but you get what you pay for. Everything is fresh and artisan. I think you should go and judge for yourself.
Me and some friends were traveling through Phoenix, and read about how amazing this place was. Boy were the reviews right! I am a big fan of thin crust pizza's, most of the pizza there are thin crust, and it was delicious. Highly recommend wiseguys. Its got white sauce, cheese, and amazing sauage! . The space was small, but seating was spacious. The staff was very friendly. If you're passing through, this place is a must try!
wow this is truly the best pizza place in phx. If you can handle the long wait it is totally worth it. plus while your waiting there is a wine bar attached with great drinks and an english pub directly across from the resturaunt. make the trip you will not regret it!
Before taking our kids to the Childrens Museum we stopped here for dinner (based on Yelp reviews). The pizza was delicious. Thin crust baked in a proper oven. We ordered a margherita and sonny boy (salami and black olives). The prices were a bit high (Sonny Boy was $18) but the food and service does not disappoint. We ate there on a Thurs around 5:15. No wait for a table but by 6 it was filling up inside. Patio had some empty tables.
Pizza was fantastic. Service was excellent. Substitutions ... No problem. We had the pizza with arugula and mozzarella...substituted smoked mozzarella for the ricotta and then added tomato sauce, valet mentioned his was the best pizza in the world...he wasn't too far off.
Being new to Phoenix, I am always on the look-out for new places to try out. This restaurant was a recommendation from a local here who told me that Pizzeria Bianco is well-known throughout the country (not sure if this is true), which put it on my list of "must-try." Eh, not super-impressed. Maybe because its reputation is a lot to live up to. Their pizza is good, but very expensive. The dining area is small, and they only seat complete parties. If you have a straggler in your group, you will get bumped down the seating chart until they arrive. There is a bar in one of the buildings next door that serves wine and tapas for you to wait in the AC which is nice. It has a bigger seating area which makes me wonder why the restaurant and the bar can't just switch... The service here is good. They made a mistake on my pizza. Since it was a small one, I wasn't going to say anything but they came with a corrected order and boxed up the mistake pizza, which I got to take home. Nice, 2 pizzas for the price of one. Made the $18 more worth it. I live super close and was going to pick up an order to take home and avoid the dining in madness---no take out orders! Dining in only! Really?!. Also, there's parking, but valet only unless you can find somewhere on the street nearby. It costs $3 that you pay for with your meal.
Best Pizza in Arizona
Ottima pizza veramente, dopo lunghi giorni ad hamburger ci voleva proprio. Forse la migliore pizza mangiata all'estero e anche in Italia. Non proprio conveniente ma i prodotti usati giustificano il prezzo ( margherita 15$).
Everyone kept saying how amazing this place was, but I didn't think it was that great. They just didn't have enough variety for me and I believe that their food was overpriced. . . There's another pizza place in downtown phoenix called La Piazza Locale that I believe is better, and has more choices.
Went May 17 in the evening. Must pay to valet car. Pizza was expensive and burned. The icing on the cake was when we asked for some Parmesan cheese and the waitress said it would cost extra. Omg,,,go to Cibo or Federal .
Chris Bianco... A Master Chef... You will be delighted with all aspects of Pizzeria Bianco. I have been a customer for many years, and never written a review. But really, it is as good as it gets. ENJOY!!
Thin Crust Pizza at its best.. . Phoenix can be proud for this place. Small but fantastic spot to be.. . The outdoor sitting and the service was awesome. The live music around makes the place more cool.. . The pizza is undoubtedly best of all I had. Can be rated under the top 10 pizza places over USA.
Prior to the D-backs game, I came here with a buddy to try their pizza.  I saw a review of this restaurant on the food TV and I really think their food is out of this world.  I had the sausage and caramelized onion pizza and it has become my favorite.  Definitely worth the wait!  I will be back for another one when passing thru Phoenix!
Its a good to great pizza place. I think too much hype has hurt it. Yet, I still keep going back there for pizza.
I've heard about this place for years and seen it on multiple TV channels.  It's been known as the best pizza in America so I finally gave it a try. I was told the wait would be about a hour for a group of 4, however it only took 20 minutes. They have a house next door you canwait at that serves wine. We ordered 2 pizzas, and both were amazing!!!  Just the right amount of cheese and sauce. It wasn't too thick and perfectly crispy. Perfect for date night!
I decided to give this critically acclaimed establishment a go since I'm in town. The first thing I would like to point out is that valet parking is mandatory here. So I go inside and am greeted immediately and shown to my seat. My order was taken rather quickly and the pizza was on my plate within 10 minutes. I ordered the Margherita  with a couple toppings. I did enjoy the pizza,  probably the best that Phoenix has to offer. It tasted like Lombardi's (in NYC) a little bit. My only gripes were the fact that you had to use valet, there were very few choices when it came to pizzas and toppings, and there is only one size, which frankly isn't enough to fill 2 adults. However, I would definitely come back if I am back in town.
I love it here!  We walked here after catching a movie at the Arizona Center.  Perfect place for date night.  Pizza is fantastic.  Desserts are fantastic.  And the staff is so courteous and attentive.  The atmosphere is romantic with their twinkly lights.  Love this place!
Brick oven, cool. Apps, yum. Salads, chill. Desserts, bomb***. Pizza... Not the best, but good. Super nice people; great atmosphere. Found a fork on the ground, if I was eating off the ground, I coulda killed myself..... . Also, there were raisins on my vanilla pudding, shoulda been skittles but no biggie.
Awesome decorations. Awesome service and atmosphere . Decent food. The pizza was burned and burly had any cheese. Very overpriced too. Salads are to die for though
Probably the best pizza in town. Wood fired oven (used for pizza, of course) also bakes their own bread, and wonderfully roasts vegetables for their vege, meat and cheese appetizer. They have a nice short list of house pizzas, or build your own to suit. Obscure wine list is fine, no harm trying a selection you haven't heard of before. Deserts are all homemade as well.
I know it's hard to live up to the hype but it really is as good as it gets.  So simple and perfect.  The best.
This place was on my "list" of places to eat, after I read a review about it - well, so glad we came! Had the tomato/mozarella (house made mozarella!!!) to start - best I've ever had! Then moved on to the Margharita & Wiseguy pizzas - both of which were excellent...bubbly cheese on the Margharita, house made  sausage with a hint of fennel on the Wiseguy slightly burnt, thin crust = perfect pizza! Went there close to closing time on a Monday night & was still packed - that says a lot!
I've wanted to try this place to see what all the hype was about. . I was nervous that there would be a huge wait but we got in a table for 2 within 15 mins! . We ordered the margarita pizza and the wise guy. Both were great pizzas. The wise guy had some of the best sausage I've ever eaten on a pizza. . The main downfall if this place are the prices. As good as these pizzas were, the price was not worth it. We spent almost $50 on 2 pizzas, and a couple of sodas. . Would I come back? Not unless I was in the area. . I was glad I could mark this off my bucket list of restaurants to try through.
Good pizza. I don't get what all the hype is about though. Its definitely not the best I've had and would never wait hours for a table.
Best Pizza in Phoenix!!
In quasi 30 anni di viaggi negli States non ho mai mangiato una Pizza italiana come questa!. La pasta e cotta alla perfezione nel forno a legna, il pomodoro e denso e gustoso, il basilico fresco e profumatissimo, la mozzarella (o giu di li...) e sicuramente buona (non buonissima) ma certamente ben oltre gli standard americani.. Che dire poi del peperoncino. Realmente piccante e fresco come quello che comunemente consumo in Italia nei miei ristoranti preferiti.. Il locale e piccolo ma molto carino con luci soffuse e gente allegra e caciarona. Anche il patio esterno e molto bello ma il caldo di queste serate rende preferibile l'aria condizionata interna.. Il personale e gentilissimo, parla anche un po' di italiano ed e molto premuroso.. In conclusione un bel posto dove trovare una ottima pizza italiana!
Really great pizza! Had the pie with sausage and caramelized onions and ate it all.  The beer selection is not that good and it is very pricey.  Worth it if you like fresh food.
Not going to lie: this is probably THE best pizza I've had ever (thin crust)... when you take a bite out of their pizza... YOU KNOW.. . The best part about it was the dough and the crust. Perfect amount of crispness as an exterior, and the inside was just the right amount of chewiness. . . We ordered the Wiseguy and the Sonny Boy. The red sauced sonny boy was my personal favorite with salami and pickled olives. The meat was definitely exceptional. You can taste the quality of where that meat has been, and the olives were definitely not your run of the mill. Their sauce was a good balance: slightly sweet which is how i like it. . . The Wiseguy I was a little less impressed with, but then again I'm not a huge fan of white pizza. It was still very good, don't get me wrong, and one thing i really liked about it were the caramelized onions as toppings.
