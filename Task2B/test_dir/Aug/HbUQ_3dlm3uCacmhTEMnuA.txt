Food was amazing!!! I had the scallop starter which where the best scallops I've ever had they were a great size , for the main T-bone steak which just broke off the bone was absolute quality! We had a side of mixed cauliflower which was cooked beautiful! Would defo recommend this restaurant but must book in advance!
Dear Chef Colicchio,. Please put your Monkey Bread dessert in my casket when I die.  If I had to eat one thing until the end of time, it would that.. Thank you,. Rahel. . p.s.. The calamari appetizer, sweet corn side and filet entree would be nice too if I'm allowed more than one thing.
If you want the top steakhouse experience don't bother.  The steak had a great tasting seasoning on it but when I am paying for good steak I want to taste the steak, not something from the spice cabinet. . . My wife and I both had the 18 oz Ribeye, mine medium rare and her's medium.   The steaks were cooked identical to a little more on the rare side than medium.   Since we had a show to make my wife just ate around the edges of hers.. . When the steaks come out they are brought to the tables on a room temp cooper pan and they bring you a room temperature plate.  So by the time you are done eating the steaks are cold.  At top quality steak houses I am used to sizzling steaks on warmed plates.. . The steak knifes they brought out were about as dull as a butter knife, they could barley cut the roasted onion much less the steak.  So while the steak was tender (but not even close to fork tender) you had to fight with it to get a bite off.. . If you want an overpriced steak that is slightly better than Texas Roadhouse come here.  If you want a great quality steak with the top steakhouse experience find somewhere else.. . Maybe we are biased because of the top quality steakhouses we have in Denver, but we were completely disappointed here after rwading all of the great reviews. . . If I wasn't expecting a top notch steak house I would probably be close to 3.5 stars but compared to what they are billing themselves as I can't go higher than 2.
Yumm. Friggin'. Yumm. . That sums up my dinner here. . I'll just get straight to the point with this one.  We ordered the filet mignon, 2lb. Lobster, sweet corn, asparagus & potato gratin. *drools at the memory* Let me just say that I  am so happy I followed my first mind and ordered the potato gratin vs. the puree(I overheard the couple next to us complaining that the puree was simply melted butter infused with a pinch of potato... How dreadful!) Welp, our potatos gratin were perfectly creamy and seasoned. The hubs said the filet was the best steak he has ever had. It was cooked medium well , seasoned and nice & juicy. Lobster sat in a tasty butter with mushrooms & shaved pea pods. Corn was fresh off the cob and the asparagus didn't disappoint. As if all that goodness wasn't enough we had the nerve to order the monkey bread w/ banana ice-cream for dessert...... Whatever you do, pleeaaasee leave room for this wonderful, sent from above, melt in your mouth, gooey scrumptious delicacy!!!!!! If you have an appetite and are in the mood for a classy sit down then you must stop by. . *Sorry. No pix to accompany this review. I greedily indulged before I even thought about snapping a photo :-/
Very solid steakhouse on the Strip. I have been to Craftsteak once, years ago (before I became a Yelper), and the experience was just as good as I remembered. . . The service from start to finish was attentive and friendly without being overbearing. Our server was very polite and explained the menu thoroughly, then gave us enough time to make our decisions.. . I ordered the Lemonhead Martini ($14), lobster bisque ($18), and my dining companion and I split the ribeye ($55) and an order of the corn (I can't remember the price on this one, I believe it was about $12). The server was very accommodating and the chef sliced the ribeye for us so we could share it.. . The food was very good. The bread that they brought before the meal was amazing. Lightly salted, warm, soft, and melted in your mouth. The lobster bisque was poured table-side over chunks of lobster. It could have used a bit more seasoning, but it was enjoyable. The steak was perfectly done, medium-rare, and had great flavor. The corn was good, but unremarkable. . . The best part of my meal was dessert! We ordered the Monkey Bread with pistachio instead of banana ice cream. The server mistakenly brought us vanilla ice cream, but they quickly caught the error and brought us the pistachio as well. On top of that, the server noticed that we didn't eat much of our corn, so she bought our dessert! I thought that it was a wonderful and thoughtful thing for her to do. The Monkey Bread was heavenly- it was basically like the best sticky bun that you'll ever have!  I'd come back just for that! . . Overall, this is a great choice if you are in the MGM and in the mood for a steakhouse.
Amazing service especially our waitress Sharon whom was very attentive and her personality was out of this world and the food was amazing! What a GREAT first experience!! I ordered the wagyu  skirt steak which was AMAZING, the corn, risotto and potatoes. All were SO good!! Will definitely come back :) @babydashco twitter . Http://www.babydashco.com
Steak was outstanding as was the service. Loved the ambiance. Not much else to say.
Crazy Good Food!  Also Crazy Expensive Food!  . . We went her with another couple & while the meal was beyond amazing, the prices were so crazy high, that is what I remember.  The wine was remarkable... Also, it was beyond a normal night out budget. . . I really, really liked this restaurant, as did everyone in our group... We were all blown away by the bill.  I guess I am not that uptown.  Lol . . We are just as happy at SW Steakhouse in the Wynn or T-Bones at Red Rock Casino.
We've been watching Top Chef for years and wanted to see just how good Tom Colicchio's restaurants  are for him to dish out all of the criticism.  Ok- he does know he's talking about! . . The atmosphere is nice, cozy and dark- very masculine decor. It was lovely. Service was excellent and friendly.  I ordered a Pom Rita on the rocks and it was so delicious I had to order another one! . . They brought warm, delicious yeast rolls to the table while we waited. . . We ordered the tomato bisque with goat cheese and the Bibb salad with bacon and blue cheese. He loved the soup and the salad was fantastic. The bacon lardons were so good our little one kept stealing them from my salad! The salad was dressed with a blue cheese dressing, and was a generous-sized salad. . . For the mains, he and I ordered the filets, medium rare. He got the corn side and I ordered the grits. The little one got the flat-iron stake, medium rare with the potato puree. . . The food was incredible. Steaks had a great,unique flavor and the sides were delicious. Grits perfectly cooked and the corn was a nice surprise . . The real standout was our little one's flat-iron steak. We ordered that because it's smaller (no kids' menu as you might imagine). The flavor was incredible. Perfectly medium rare and flavorful. The potato puree was also good, but he polished off the steak! . . We didn't order dessert, nothing on there we had to have, but it all looked good. . . Definitely have respect for the judging he dishes out on Top Chef!
One of my favorite steak houses on the strip. Be prepared for the best steak of your life.
We had an amazing meal at Craft Steak Wednesday night.. I had the scallops and they were great.. The orzo was also amazing and the fresh shucked corn was outstanding.. Our waitress, I think her name was Sharon was great.
Amazing food! Perfect service! Great atmosphere! This place is as good as it gets!
Craftsteak is a very pricey but excellent steakhouse.  It's a beautifully warm, elegant setting, with decor mainly in dark shades, wood, and leather.  There're also beautiful, colorful, lively, fun paintings of cows -- yes, cows -- on the walls over the booths.  The staff is outstanding -- friendly, patient, helpful, knowledgeable, and efficient.. . The menu is surprisingly large (I rarely see a menu this size at a place categorized as "fine dining"), as are the portions -- you won't go hungry here without trying, especially if you have a party of four or less and go with the family style option...sooooo much excellent food!  The food has great flavor, especially the meats (of course) and, surprisingly, the bibb salad, which had a light blue-cheese dressing that brought the components together perfectly.  The drinks list is HUGE, with especially extensive wine and scotch sections.. . My one issue with Craftsteak is that I felt like it was very overpriced -- even though the quality is excellent -- especially the drinks.  (I knew the bottle prices of a few of the scotches on the list and the markup on a glass seemed ridiculously high to me.)
Went to Craft steakhouse for a bachelor party dinner.  I didn't have high expectations because I haven't been to many steakhouses on the strip and I'm used to typical Ruth Chris or wolf gang type places.  I must say this is probably the best steak I've ever had.  I had the wagyu rib eye with snap pea risotto, potatos, mushrooms for my side.  Steak was cooked and seasoned to my liking and the risotto is so delicious.  We order the shrimp cocktail appetizer which was good but nothing special than any other restaurant.  The monkey bread dessert is to die for.  Heaven in your mouth... . I will say the one down side is the price... def the most expensive steak dinner of my life.  But worth it.  We ordered 2 bottles of wine so my portion of the bill came out to $200.
I don't mind paying high prices for food when it is worth it, but I have had much better steaks at a fraction of the cost. The signature short ribs were good, but not the best I have ever had. I didn't like the cheesy photographer harassing people for photos... really takes away from the intimate dining experience. Not worth it...
Had a wonderful meal here.  Service was exceptional and food was wonderful.  I'm from Dallas, so I know what a proper steakhouse is about and this one ranks high up there.  We ended up doing the chef's menu with a couple of suggestions and it was really a special evening.  I'm not sure I would do that chef's menu again.  It was wonderful, but it was a TON of food.  I think we took 6 take home boxes with us.  . . Highly suggested - a steakhouse that also has a bit of creativity and doesn't just present a hunk of protein.
Craftsteak was amazing. Definitely worth the money and worth all five stars. We were a bachelorette party of 4 ladies who were on a time crunch as we had tickets to see Boyz II Men at the Mirage at 7:30. One of the great things about this restaurant is that you can make a reservation via Yelp/Open Table or on their website. And our time was 5:45, I believe. . . For appetizers, we tried the Diver Sea Scallops. I LOVED THESE. They were so flavorful and perfectly seasoned. So perfectly cooked as well! Honestly out of the world, and certainly the best scallops I have ever had. It's definitely a dish you must have and try whilst here.. . We also had the organic lettuces with lemon vinaigrette. Good salad, but very large pieces. I didn't care too much for the lemon, but that's on me and not on the restaurant.. . I split the Free Range Chicken au jus with my girl friend and that was moist and tender. Seasoned very well. We had french fries and the Brentwood sweet corn as sides. French fries were your typical french fries, nothing extremely special, but still delicious. That corn, however, also amazing! Never thought to saute corn and green onions together, but it was innovative to me, haha. The seasonings they used were on point though. . . Very immaculate service from the chefs and staff. I would go back again and again if I lived in Vegas. We were in a rush for our show, so our poor waiter was rushed by us. We tipped him generously though and hoped he didn't think we hated his service, he was excellent. He even brought us dessert and congratulated my bride friend.
This is considered a very high priced place (+$100/pp) from my traditional dining, so our expectations were very high from an experience and food quality perspective. It delivered on both accounts. I initially struggled to make my choices for dinner...so many great options. Then when the waiter described the chef's beef selection, we were sold. It is essentially family style with a HUGE variety. You get around 4 appetizers, 2 beef choices, 3 vegetables, and 4 desserts. This doesn't even includes the fantastic dinner rolls. Of the food we had, my strongest recommendations would be: Prosciutto San Daniele, Domestic Waygu Filet, Shishito Peppers, and the Cinnamon Monkey Bread.
The first time I went here the food was amazing! What dreams are made of. The steaks are perfect, the potato puree is like a cloud of yummy deliciousness, the lobster bisque was so good I was ruined and could never find anything close to it. The staff was on top of their game and was very friendly. My company was great, the night was great. The next year I went back, buzzing at the idea if another bomb meal. Unfortunately, the first time was the best time. I have been hesitant to write a review on this place. My date and I both ordered the lobster bisque. I was so excited, I was waiting for a year to have this moment again and when it came to the table horrors of all horrors I find a 1 in curly hair tangled in the lobster. I pray it was from someone's head because I had about two bite before I realized it. They comped the soup and that's it! The rest of the meal wasn't very memorable after that. I wasn't going to write a review on this establishment but I am looking up sites and restaurants for our yearly Vegas trip. I understand things happen but they could have been more accommodating. I will not be returning here. The first time was the best time and the second time was the last time.
After spending a long weekend working, my co worker and I, who were both staying at the MGM Grand, decided to stay in house for dinner, and try out Craft Steak. . . Everything from the ambiance, to the wait staff, to the amazing food was perfect from the moment we walked in. . . The Pork Belly Slaw was a amazing twist for a stater salad. That followed by the perfect medium rare cooked bone in ribeye was a perfect combination, along with the Risotto. The Mushroom & Pancetta Risotto has to be the best tasting side dish I have had in Las Vegas, and I have eaten an numerous places there. . . All in all, I cannot say anything bad about my experience. I would definitely recommend dinning here.
Excellent service,  Excellent Food.  Be prepared for a huge bill.  $350 for dinner for my wife and I.
Craftsteak is an upscale steakhouse neatly tucked away in the enormous opulent MGM Grand Hotel and Casino. It's a beautiful restaurant with stunning decor. It's running a close second only to the gorgeous decor at Stack inside The Mirage.. . We were greeted by one of the hosts right away and we were seated in probably 3 minutes or less even though we were about 20 minutes early. The entire staff was excellent, everyone was very friendly. Beverages were refilled promptly and so was the fabulous bread that they start you with. The bread looked like Hawaiian/ pretzel bread with some coarse salt sprinkled on top delivered nice and hot to the table in a small rectangular tin. The bread was excellent!. . We ordered the Caesar salad to start, however the salad wasn't quite what I expected. They serve you an enormous portion of romaine lettuce that's uncut... Yes.. uncut. I have never had to put in so much work to eat one salad! I nearly broke a sweat. They also put a couple of small anchovies on top of the salad as well. Those quickly found a home somewhere off to the side of my plate. The croutons were awesome though.. . We ordered the rib eye bone in, risotto, & fingerling potatoes. Unfortunately, the rib eye didn't live up to expectations. It was under seasoned and didn't have that fall off the bone quality that I like. It was a good steak but didn't reach the championship level of Mesa Grill or The Steakhouse. The risotto on the other hand was excellent! Excellent flavor no doubt, my regards to the chef. The risotto is something you MUST order at this restaurant. Overall, a great dining experience that I highly recommend.
Since I wrote this review Craft Steak has apologized and contacted me. Again, it wasn't that a mistake was made by them it was the lack of accommodation. I feel better taken care of now and might return. I don't mine paying for anything but I expect a great experience.
