This place has such an awesome view of the fountains, and that alone is worth a star in my book. If you can grab a table on the outdoor patio when it's not too hot, be sure to do so. Besides the view, the menu is pretty awesome too... especially if you like olives as much as I do!. . My husband and I came here a few times during a recent trip to Vegas, both out of convenience and the fact that we like what they have to offer. Two of our visits were for lunch. I love the fact that they start the meal with bread and... Butter? Nope! Olive oil? Guess again! OLIVE TAPENADE! Are you beginning to feel my love for olives yet? ;-) I had to try their daily salad special, which just happened to be offered both days we were there and was good enough that I ordered it twice. The mix of watermelon, tomato, arugula, and feta cheese did a happy dance in my mouth! I chose two pasta dishes for my two lunch entrees... gnocchi with kalamata olives and goat cheese (super great flavors combined there) and amaretto butternut squash ravioli (sweet and savory all at the same time). My husband also enjoyed the gnocchi dish one day and went with a burger for his next meal, which he thought was delicious. . . During another visit, we came for drinks and dessert. The drinks were out of this world good... a daily special of raspberry mojitos with plenty of fresh raspberries and mint muddled into the drink. For my dessert choice, I went with a refreshing sorbet. It consisted of three flavors (peach bellini, mixed berry, and melon) set on top of a dish of fresh berries... a perfect summer day treat! My husband opted for a sweet ice cream sandwich duo that looked super yum.. . I'm sure we'll make a stop at Olives again in the future. The food and view are tough to beat!
I've dined here several years ago and remember it being amazing. We went for dinner last night. Let's just say my favorite part of the dinner was the olive spread we received. . My husband got the prime-- the sauce ruined everything. It was bitter and awkward. . I got the gnocchi-- a dish a frequently order. It was too soft and didn't have any taste. I picked through the dish and ate the olives and tomatoes. . I won't be returning. Very disappointed.
My husband made a reservation for my birthday, he requested the fountain view but of course was not guaranteed. We arrived 40 min early & the hostesses were so overwhelmed, didn't even say happy birthday to me & told us to wait an hour & a half for the view.. . We took the regular table, the restaurant was so packed,we were literally next to other tables & it was super loud we couldn't have a conversation so we left. . . The restaurant doesn't not provide a memorable experience, they should focus in quality & not quantity!
Their steak is a joke.  It couldn't have been more than 3oz.  for 49$.  If you are looking for a nice steak dinner go elsewhere or be prepared to go to dinner somewhere afterwords which is where I am going now.
Stopped by here for lunch on a weekday. No reservations were required and we stepped right in to an open table.. . We had the carpaccio and it was delicious. My friend also had the scallops, which were served in risotto. This was a very well made dish, texture and taste wise. I would highly recommend it for anyone who likes scallops and risotto. . . We also ordered the truffle fries which were potato wedges with truffles as well as a flat bread. Both were good. The flat bred resembles a pizza and makes a good appetizer for a party of 3-4. . . One of the best parts of Olives is the view of the Bellagio fountains. Sitting inside, the backdrop of this restaurant are the fountains. Probably very romantic at night. There's also balcony seating and I would love to try to get a table on the balcony next time, if it's not too hot. . . Overall, very recommended!
Excellent food. I went with friends ane we ordered the chicken pie, bangersand mash, chicken blt, and the fish n chip. Everything was good. Service was prompt and friendly.  The experience was enjoyable.
Love this place. The food is excellent top to bottom and the staff is extraordinarily attentive. My wife can't eat dairy and all three times we've been there, they have adjusted dishes to meet her needs and all were delicious. . . The squid and octopus appetizer is one of my favorites and the tuna tartare is outstanding as well. This trip my wife had the beef tenderloin, which was like butter, and the olive oil mashed potatoes, which were really great. I had the sea bass with sausage and bean cassoulet, watercress, and garlicky broccolini, all in an orange juice and balsamic vinegar sauce that was just perfect. . . The menu is not cheap but this place is totally worth it, right down to the delicious olive tapanades that come with the bread. If you're looking for a great dinner in Vegas, this should be on the list.
Holy crap, get the $18 beef carppacio appetizer.  Normally when you order beef carpaccio you expect about 8-10 thin slices... not here.  You get seriously about 1/3 lb of beef.  I wouldn't say it's the best beef carpaccio ever, but it was very good... and with a generous portion.. . I elected for the 3 course prix fixe menu.  Came with a watermelon salad, seafood pasta and fruit sorbet for $32.  Pretty cheap.  The watermelon salad was.. okay... the seafood pasta was good, albeit a bit bland and boring.  the sorbet was pretty good.. . My gf got the scallop risotto..... which was amazing.  The risotto was flavored with truffles and I could be wrong but the bite I tried from her had actual pieces of black truffle....... it wasn't just truffle oil!  I was jealous of her dish.
I was in the restaurant last night.  My friend  and I arrived pretty late, but were told we could still order dinner if we sat at the bar.  Andrew was friendly and very accommodating when my friend didn't like her flatbread pizza. I had the lamb chops which were amazing! She had the flatbread replaced with the mushroom risotto. Awesome!  Will definitely come back again and hopefully will be able to sit on the patio to watch the fountains then!
This was my favorite restaurant in Vegas (I was there for five days and ate out for lunch and dinner every day).  . We started with the flatbread--the HouseFarm? one (with asparagus).  It was solid and had a nice texture.  I preferred the taste of the foccacia bread that came at the start of the meal but this was a good choice for an app and was a good choice to split among three people.. For my entree, I had the mushroom papperdelle.  It was really good.  The description is right on except for the lack of mushrooms in the dish.  There were actually very few mushrooms in the dish but it was still good.  Nothing amazing or different but a very good dish.. The drinks were good (strong).  My friends loved their drink called the Slingback--very delicious and sweet.  I had a martini which was good.. Service was amazing.  Like most places, they make you wait no matter what even if you have a reservation but they seated us quickly.  . This is the ONLY place I went to this trip that I wouldreturn to on my next trip.  I have no idea why the reviews are not averaging higher especially compared to the places that were five stars.
Excellent view, very good food, pricey, service very good and very nice atmosphere. . Servers look a little stressed and very busy. Don't know why so I won't speculate. . I'm happy my 2 boys got to see a classy wedding proposal. I actually caught it all on video. I hope they learned something from the young man. Great planning on his part and they looked like very nice genuine people.
Upon my return to Olives, I had one of the most romantic and wonderful experiences ever in Las Vegas. The food was exceptional, the service was out standing. But what took my breath away is sitting outside next to the fountains at night during a full summer moon. I felt like we weren't in Las Vegas, between the cuisine, wine and service. Thank you so much for this wonderful experience and I can't wait to go back upon my next visit to Las Vegas!
I was really looking forward to eating here as I'm a sucker for Mediterranean food. But I was pretty disappointed. Had the squid and octopus to start - the octopus was pretty mediocre even with a strange flavor, the squid overcooked and chewy. Had the scallops and prosciutto, it was only ok. . . The decor was great and the service fine. The glass of wine I had was quite good. . . ButI came for the food and it was a serious disappointment.
My wife and I came here with my mom on four separate occasions during our most recent trip to Vegas.  Twice for lunch, once for dessert, and once for drinks.  Each time this place did not disappoint.  It's located just inside the Bellagio, near all of the shops that sell things which very few people can afford.  They do have a small, but nice outdoor patio.  They have big umbrellas and misters to help you avoid the heat.  It has a nice view of the fountain show if you eat out there at night.. . I tried several different things while I was here:  Caesar salad, complimentary bread, gnocchi, cheeseburger and fries, rasberry mojito, and some cookie ice cream sandwiches.  Everything I had was really good.  Lots of good flavors in all of their dishes.  They're also big on presentation, which I like as well.  I probably liked the cheeseburger and fries the best.  It was full of flavor, and it was huge.  I don't think you could go wrong with most anything on the menu, though.  It's probably better to come here for lunch, as everything is a little cheaper.  That said, it's still fairly pricey for lunch.  Then again, you're in the Bellagio in Vegas.  You're not going to find any Burger King type prices anywhere in this place.. . I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a nice lunch or dinner with an excellent view.  I enjoyed everything and will be back when the opportunity presents itself.
Excellent all the way!
The free bread with olive spread is delicious. Overall good and cheapest place to watch the fountains while you eat.
Compared to the rest of the restaurants at the Bellagio, this one is A ok for me at least. I did not find the service to be as High end as in other Bellagio restaurants. Otherwise food also was ok. . The view if you are sitting outside (which I have seen now about 10 times or so) is stunning if it is your first time.
Bad host, great bar, awesome waiters, and incredible view!!! Food was very good. I got the seat outside, fountain view. It was great experience in Las Vegas. However, I was waiting for 2 hours to get that seat even I reserved and shown up early. So stupid! But worth it. Big thanks to the waiter, he finally moved us to the edge of patio. It is the best!
One of the best meals I have ever had. We have wanted to try Olives for a long time and just never had made it here before on trips to Las Vegas. The pasta was handmade and melted in your mouth. The entire meal was perfection.
Solid.. Even though we were staying IN the Bellagio, we still totally got lost and showed up late for our reservation (past the grace period).  They still seated us without too much fuss.. Unless you are vegetarian or have some other legit reason, you MUST get the beef carpaccio.  It is to die for, and was a great size to split for 4 people.  I also had the lamb lollipop entree, and it was great. On the pricey side, but hey it's Vegas, and the food does not disappoint.
Went here for dinner during a business trip.  I've always wondered about the restaurant located behind the Bellagio fountains.  The service was superb.  Our table of 4 split the beef carpaccio and tuna tartare.  Both were pretty amazing. I ordered the clams linguine.  It was probably one of the best I've ever had.  So light, so tasty with a hint of lemon juice.  The noodles weren't your regular linguine noodles but more like thin slices of lasagna.  I ate it so fast!. . One of my co-workers ordered the salmon and he said it was pretty dry.  Another co-worker ordered the mushroom paparedelle.  Though, good, it was a bit on the heavy side.  The 3rd co-worker...well, honestly I can't remember what he ordered!  With drinks, appetizers and main courses our bill came close to $450.  I wouldn't say it was worth all that money, but it was good.
