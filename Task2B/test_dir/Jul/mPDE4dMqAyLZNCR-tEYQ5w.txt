I liked the show and I saw it two times with my friends. Very unusual stage! The show is based on a story, that's why it was even more interesting to watch it. The hall (the theater) is sooo impressive and beautiful!
No. No. No. And No. . . Not what I expected. Not thrilling, Not exciting, and NOT worth the price. (Whatever that may be because my tickets were compd). . I must admit, the costumes were pretty dope! The theatre was awesome and clearly they have put in a ton of mulah into all that equipment used on stage but holy cow, this was a painfully boring show! . . There were a couple scenes that had me but for the majority of the show I struggled staying awake. This was a very long play...with great sound effects and beautiful background projection scenes. However, the performances were boring and mediocre. That battle scene that was taken out due to the tragic accident appeared to have been the highlight of this show. This was replaced with cartoon montage...looked cool but must have been awesome seeing the real thing. . . I would never pay full price to see this, but if they offer discounted tickets, for sure worth snagging a couple.
So this type of thing is not exactly my cup of tea, however as much as try not to enjoy Cirque De Soleil, I can't help it! They are just amazing.. Ka was just full of unbelievable stunts and tricks, I was just in awe. It had a weird bit where it was just a movie on a screen, but I can forgive that, as the rest was faultless. The performers are just so incredibly talented you can't help but be spellbound.. To top it off Sharon Stone bumped into me in the line to go in and apologized to me. I was dumbstruck, which is a pretty rare occurrence for me, as I like to talk. I mean Sharon Stone in Vegas! Casino and stuff, it was just too cool.. Anyway, go see the show, you wont be sorry.
too good to be missed!!! one of the best shows in vegas that is a must visit!! . . yes, it's kinda pricey but its worth a penny.. . and you can always browse in the internet to get a good deal.. because thats what i did!. . spectacular!!! n the stage setting n acting n acrobatic n everything is WOW! . . speechless...
3 rows back,dead center..missed the show going on on the side walls. Story was kind of hard to follow, but entertaining. The two gymnasts inside the rolling wheels were awesome! They should have an announcement as to what the premise of the story is at the beginning
This is by a smudge the best show in Vegas when it comes to Cirque style shows, in my opinion. I've seen all the old Cirque shows, including Zumanity, Beatles, Elvis, O, and even Le Reve, but KA stands out as the best.. . I loved the theater. Once, I sat at the second to last row and I felt that they were one of the best seats in the house just because you're able to see the whole theater. The show isn't just on the stage, but the whole theater is the stage at certain parts of the show. . . The mechanics of the props are amazing. The pace is perfect, there's fineness, a plot, and characters I liked. My favorite part was probably the way the stage changes as well as the shadow puppets. . . See this show, you won't regret it!
Very disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this show. Of all the cirque's, this is my least favorite. After the tragedy of a performers death on the last scene (the vertical wall) they changed it to a hologram.In my opinion this ruined the show for me. The last scene could have been so powerful with live performers and instead I saw a projected image. I would definitely go see Mystere or another cirque that actually performs the entire time instead and not waste the money on Ka.
Never having been to a cirque du solei show I wasn't really sure what to expect. My mom got us both tickets during a girls weekend in Vegas. Coming in to the theatre there is an exciting air of mystery. The attendants that help you find your seat have amazing costumes on and remain in character as well as serve as entertainment as you await for the performance to begin. The show its self is captivating and the performers are brilliant! . . SEATING TIPS **. We got tickets in the 3rd row which was awesome, however for this particular show I would suggest sitting as far back from the stage as possible. . Part of the performance is done towards the middle of the audience so if you don't want to have to crane your neck backwards sit further back. . At the beginning the stage also rises for part of the performance and again it's a bit harder to see if you're sitting close to the front.
Awesome theater Awesome stage Awesome show, One of the coolest shows I've ever seen!
I wanted so badly to love this show but walked out annoyed. The stage is amazing. The beginning and the middle were captivating but too much dead time sprinkled in throughout and by dead time I mean the comical bits that are used as a tool to distract you/set the stage for the next scene (i.e. the sand pit part). The gripe I have about Ka is they failed to provide a climax and therefore lost me by the end of the show. The part of the show where it's supposed to be an epic battle scene on the vertical stage was not done live and instead was a previously recorded scene that was displayed across one of the stages. I was so confused watching this and the entire time they showed it I kept thinking, "What the hell are they doing? Why isn't this live? Why am I watching this video? WHY AREN'T THEY DOING THIS BIT LIVE?!" I'm assuming that's the part of the show when a late performer's cable snapped and fell to her death, and if so, they should have re-choreographed that part of the show or done away with it completely. Watching a recording of it just left me, well, unsatisfied. It was incomplete for me.
I go on yelp to look up reviews but never rate anything.  I don't care enough to take the time...until now.  I've wanted to see Ka for a couple years now and was always impressed by what I saw online.  Worst mistake ever!  I actually kept asking my husband if we could leave during the show. It was horrible. 5 good minutes when they came out with the wheel and the 2 guys killed it! The other hour was a complete waste of my valuable Vegas time & money! I was so sad that I picked that as my ANNV gift to my hubby.  Don't go!
Can we do minus stars???. this was so slow and boring.... alotof barking and animal sounds - . annoying guys jumping up every so often... COMPLETE waste of money..... we couldnt wait for it to be over..... . IMO Michael Jackson and O are MILLION times better...
If you are in Vegas I'll definitely recommend you go to see the Ka! Even though these tickets are a little pricy they are well worth it! Any cirque du soleil show is breath taking with all their acrobatic moves, but this one was on a whole new level!. . From beginning to end their story was captivating filled with action and excitement. The whole atmosphere of the room is great! Their seats are awesome, each seat has their own music system built in. And their stage is over the top crazy, it moves!!. . If you are looking for a show to watch, I'll definitely recommend this one!
This show was horrible.  I had high expectations for it since it has been around for awhile. I think this show was a complete waste of money. I was bored during the whole show. This show is very slow paced and there not a lot of action. I wish I would've seen  O instead. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
It's been a few years since I've seen this show, but I remember it pretty well.  The things that stand out are how well the story line evolved, how epic and real everything felt, and how well the typical Cirque acrobatics were tied into the plot.  I feel like that last part is challenging.  A lot of shows have a bit of story progression (if there's a plot at all), and then jump into some artistic scene with people jumping around and/or dancing.  However, this show melds the two almost seamlessly. .  . The acrobatics, stage mechanics, and story are all top notch and it's one of my favorite Cirque shows. If you want feel like you're on 'shrooms go see Mystere.  If you want a really terrific and creative show, go see KA.  Better yet, see them both!
I've seen 8 or more Cirque shows and, while the performers were good and the costumes & scenery were really interesting, the story line was really difficult to follow.  The show seemed shorter with few spotlight performances.  Still fun to see but I would probably recommend other Cirque shows before this one
My first Vegas show and it was amazing!! I had a difficult time choosing between which shows to take my family when we went down for my dad's birthday years back. Located inside MGM, the hotel we were staying, it made it easier to choose. Also the fact that they had sent my dad a special offer for free room, discounted VIP seats, and credits for dining. The choice was between a bigger discount for Ka or a lesser discount at any other Cirque du soleil show. Asking my friends, it was a close race between Ka and O. Feeling like I'll try to watch O this trip since we're staying at the Bellagio.. for my dad's birthday haha. . Back on point, there are no photos or recording during the show. It's dimly light, very exciting. It's not a scary show at all, but if you have easily frighten children, don't let them sit in the aisle seats.. . There's a story to it, so try to follow along as they don't use words at all. I thought it was action filled and spectacular. I didn't want it to end. Great show for family and dates.
I really liked the theme of the show and the theatre. The stage is the main attraction and it's impressive from a mechanical point of view. The physical perfomances were very good and the it's very entertaining. The only bad thing is the final scene is digital which is a bit of a let down. I know that a female performer died in that scene but watching the final scene on a huge TV is a little strange. Anyhow overall the show is actually amazing and worth going. I would buy tickets as close to the stage as possible; the theatre is very large and cheap seats are not ideal. Only one scene is set high so it would be an issue like some other CDS shows. The stage is still the main thing about the show...wow.
Firstly, let's get my own subjective viewpoint out of the way. I have a HUGE respect for what these people do. It's daring, it's risky, and it takes years and years of dedicated training. If I'm ever asked about Cirque by someone who's never been? I zealously tell them to go. I've been to three, and plan on going to many, many, more.. . That said... the notorious "climax" for this show just isn't there. The digital replacement is not only, well, a digital replacement, but a shoddy one at that. It's blurry, and it's extremely difficult to even see what's going on. This is a prime example in the importance of a solid ending. . . The rest of the show had brilliant moments, but even then, the story dwindled sporadically, and relied on the acrobatics to keep your attention.. . It's all about a ratio of enjoyment to cost, and though the enjoyment WAS there, it just wasn't worth the $100 ticket cost. I know it seems tempting since it's slightly cheaper than "O" or any of the other more acclaimed Vegas shows, but my advice? Just spring the extra $30 and go for one of those! KA has some tuning up to do!
Most boring of the shows I've seen by far. I now realize the holograph ending was put in place after the tragic accident that happened last year but the end should have been re-choreographed. It was so anticlimactic. I fell asleep at least 3-4 times. The music was beautiful as was the stage but not nearly enough to compensate. I used MyVegas points and paid $86 for two $108 seats. Even with that I still felt my night would have been better spent on the strip. Skip this one unless you're into dance and baton twirling only.
My family and I came here a few years ago ( I know, late review! ). It was a very awesome Cirque.. . My brother had college discounts, so he hooked it up and we saved $30 per ticket in our family. Wouldn't mind watching it again if given the opportunity.
was very excited to see this show after all of the raves. I have previously seen Mystere and Zumanity... Both of which set the bar pretty high and then I saw Ka tonight and was heavily disappointed.  I kept waiting to be wow - ed.. . it moved along quite slowly with less happening and many sections dragged on. The music was slow and lullaby like and because some scenes were so long and repetitive I struggled to stay alert and found myself drifting to sleep on numerous occasions.. . The 2nd to last scene is all projected and is of a very very low quality of projection and is quite long... A huge let down. I know last year a performer fell and passed away during this scene... hence it having been changed to being a projection (film) of the performance.. but the quality was terrible and blurry and really let down the whole show. i struggled to keep up with the storyline at this time as the characters were not clear. This part of the show should be re choreographed and rethought as it has no effect except for bringing the quality of the whole show down.. . The one good thing about this show is the story line. and if u like to watch capoeira.. . I would highly reconsider seeing this show if u really want an impressive show.... GO TO MYSTERE instead!!!!!. Mystere has large variety of type of acts and talents. i thought mysteres stage was a higher quality (sometimes i could see tramps backstage and characters waiting to come on stage) it moves along through the acts fast leaving u with wanting more (not yawning wondering when it will move on), there is a full live band and singers, a much larger  cast.. in all honesty during mystere i onstantly had goosebumps and got teary eyed during  because the whole performance was so powerful and i found myself overwhelmed with the quality and amount of things happening. I wish I didn't go to Ka and spent the money on another show.
It seemed like a good show but we arrived just after itstarted and our expensive seats were taken. When we got there and picked up the tickets. They didn't say anything about our seats being filled or possibly accidentally taken. When sat they made it seem like it was a big deal and had us sit in partial view spots. Thinking it might be ok, I waited till the end to talk to box office but they said I should have just walked out. The manager of the theater said it was our fault. I have never been treated like just a dollar sign. They just want your money.
I was very excited for this show and sadly, even more disappointed. When you walk in, it looks like it will be amazing. The architecture looks like something out of disneyland, I took my seat and could hardly wait for the show to start; then, the show started.. . Several members of the cast are out of sync which is highly distracting. During almost every scene you will see the entire cast which is present at that moment just standing still while a single performer does repetitive moves that are not entertaining for excess of 5 minutes. Randomly, some porn-star Tarzan enters the storyline for no apparent reason. Several of the scenes, different members of the cast would mess up, again, it was quite distracting. The room was too hot, they need to turn up the AC. There is an impressive dragon outside of the theater entrance but sadly, no dragon ever comes into the show. Wait, no, scratch that, if you like shadow puppets, you'll see a dragon for about a minute before some horrible fight scene occurs.. . Everything about this show is outdated. The music is like a bad 80's rock style opera that has enticing highs and melodic lows. Honestly, the music was the best part. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, eager to leave and call it a night after that disappointment. . . For what you get,this show is extremely over priced. Trust me, don't go and waste your time or your money.. . BE WARNED!!!!. There is a scene (probably 30 minutes into the storyline) where a bright, hot white flash occurs. It blinded me for over five minutes and gave me a headache. At the end of the show, they set off hot white fireworks that blinded not only me, but every single person around my area. We were all looking in other directions and shielding our faces.. . I heard that there was good fire scenes in this show too, trust me, there aren't It's mainly just bad storyline with over drawn scenes that will put you to sleep.. . Cirque Du Soleil should be ashamed to have their name associated with this sham.
This is the 3rd Cirque-type of show that I was able to watch (seen Zumanity and the Beatles Love) and I will say that this was the best of the three. . . In the beginning, they had a skit where they had pulled someone from the audience and trashed his camera and cell phone....the message they were trying to relay if you had any of those because they are not allowed LOL. . The show itself was pretty cool...it had a story line so it wasn't too boring. I'm always interested by acrobatic performances so that kept my attention during the whole show....some parts made my heart stop because the performers where not harnessed LOL. . Overall it is a good show and would recommend it!
Of all the Cirque shows, I felt like this was the most underwhelming. It was missing the awe that I expect when I see a Cirque show. The story also didn't make much sense. The performers were strong and graceful, but the acts were boring. At one point, I felt like I was watching a show from circus circus. And the graphics in one of the acts seemed really dated. Don't waste your money on this one.
Simply put.  In a smaller theater this show could have been amazing.  The production value is fantastic.  The minute detail is difficult to appreciate from anywhere but front row.  The story line detracts from the overall performance.    And the CGI fight scene following the high level Wheel of Death Performance was disappointing. Perhaps the directors should rewrite the scene if it is impossible to safely perform  live.
