Terrific room in Grand Tower and the casino is slamming tonight! Sexy ladies everywhere. The tables are full. Restaurants and bars are jamming. People partying hard. Totally what Vegas is all about!. . My company got me a room here a few months ago for a biz trip. I had never stayed here before and did not know what to expect. Walking around MGM all I could think is that this thing is huge! (That's what she said!) This place is one giant maze that I got lost in a few times. Lots of walking.  . . The restaurants range from celebrity chef endeavors to the standard cafe and even a small food court. The shops are a bit basic and not on the scale of the Venetian and other high end casino resorts. There seems to be about three or four Starbucks locations throughout, and each one could have their own zip code!. . Some cool bars and clubs here to party in. Brings in a hot looking 20-30 something crowd that offers some sexy eye candy for both men and women. Their pool is a hot spot that's well laid out and offers more terrific views. Uber club Hakkasan Nightclub. and KA by Cirque Du Soleil are a must when staying here.. . Was a breeze checking in at 8pm. My Grand Tower room was super nice, modern, spacious, clean, with a comfortable bed. I was placed in a newly renovated Grand King room and it was the bomb! . . After unloading my luggage I went down and goofed around a bit on the $1 slots. Immediately hit a $300 winner and used it to go party!. . What happens in Vegas........
got a surprisingly great rate when i found out i had an MLife card that i signed up for a while ago. haven't stayed at MGM in over 10years so it was a welcoming return. got here on a Saturday morning at 830am and there was a line 3 wide, all the way to the casino floor for the baggage check-in. holy moly. convention season is pretty rough. . . after that kurfufle, check in went pretty smooth. we were able to get a room key in a couple hours. we didn't try to get to the room, just grabbed a drink and hung out for a bit, waiting for the line to die down. after dropping off the bags, headed to pool and spent the rest of the morning there.. . we got a west wing room which was pretty modern and chic. unfortunately, there was no sink counter area for mama. that part really irked her. room and bed were pretty nice. shower and toilet were separate and fancy. the hallways were pretty freaking long and you had to commit to walking it cause there's no turning back. luckily, elevators were fast and not ever full. . . the MGM affords a lot of options for both dining, drinking and good times. our second night we pretty much didn't have to leave the property for anything. . . overall, a pretty cool stay at a great property. might just get a comped room from all the $$$ we spent here. at least, we should! we'll be back.
Staying MGM Grand Hotel is not Grand at all. The rooms and hallways have filthy carpet.  My room has no window access and looks like an upscale prison cell! Never again.
One of the best hotels to stay in Vegas. Good food and shopping also has a couple Starbucks inside. . The only downside was that it was far from everything! . We walked to the strip a couple times from the hotel and it was over am hr, but with the nice weather it wasn't such an issue. . The beds were comfy and clean, & fast check in & check out
The MGM Grand was my first experience staying in Las Vegas and I have to say, for the first time, it didn't disappoint.. . If you want action, MGM is hopping 24/7 with action. The casino is so huge that I still haven't seen all of the 170,000+ square feet of gaming area. MGM sort of bridges the gap between a great casino and a great resort. It ties both in with a proper attention given to both. You can find very reasonable rates per night there. It's conveniently located at the South end of the strip, so coming from McCarron International, your cab fees will be light. When you pull up to the MGM, you can just sense the rich history of this place. The epic pay-per-view boxing matches, the world-renowned shows, the great concerts, etc. When the sign says "The City of Entertainment," you have no problem believing it. The lobby is a beautiful marble with the MGM lion front and center. It is a grand entrance, which is both breathtaking and elegant. . . From a gaming perspective, I love that the MGM connects both low rollers and high rollers and doesn't discriminate their table offerings based upon a crowd they're trying to attract, such as The Wynn, The Bellagio, or the Venetian. You can easily still find $5 blackjack tables there, and of course, the $100 tables are always available. The mid-range rooms are very nice. The beds are super comfortable, nice blackout curtains in the afternoon to block out that intense summer time sun. The bathrooms are spacious and luxuriously appointed. . . Of all the casinos I've visited, the dealers at the MGM have been by far the most cool, down-to-earth, fun, funny and engaged. The casino has many restaurants, including Emeril's, there are day spas, pool and beach area for the kids, and nice shops if that's your thing.. . I can't think of a better place if you've never been to Vegas and want the experience without laying down a boatload of cash to get it. I will always rotate MGM into my stays in Vegas. It was my first and will always hold a special place in my heart.
Fabulous stay. Our room was awesome.   Everything was perfect. Toni our Bellman was fabulous.
I stayed here with a bunch of friends and I was really impressed with the service and property. Everything was modern and on point. It felt luxurious and comfortable.  I picked the hotel because we knew we were going to hakkasan. We actually got comped a few tickets as well. We called for housekeeping a few times because we needed more towels, etc and every time they were speedy and friendly. Besides the rooms,  the casino is huge and the property just sprawls out. Because I go to vegas so often I don't even walk around and explore anymore so there were a lot of areas that I didn't see but I'm sure you can walk around this place for hours and be entertained.
My gf and I have been here 4 days and overall we've had a great time! . The service was great when we ordered in,we were given free passes to Hakassan club  & the front desk was prompt when we needed anything. . I recommend MGM and would come back...:)
Great hotel.  I stayed here last night for the fourth night of my July 4th weekend, but I've stayed here dozens of times over the years.  The rooms here are cheap if you book well in advance.  E.g., you can get a low end room for around $100/night on the weekends if you book at least 4 to 6 months ahead of time.  If you book within the last couple months before your stay, that same room might be around $250/night on the weekends.  . . The rooms here are very contemporary.  My room basically looked like an Ikea demonstration bedroom.  Outside your room, you will find a plethora of entertainment, shops and restaurants.  . . Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak here has the best porterhouse I've ever eaten.  You will find excellent service here.  Rainforest cafe is a wonderful family restaurant that has animatronic animals everywhere that regularly move and make sounds in the rainforest decorated surroundings.  The menu items are American food.  The prices are reasonable and Kids will love this place.. . Hakkasan here has the reputation for being one of the biggest and best nightclubs in the world.  Steve Aoki, Calvin Harris, Tiesto are resident DJs here, which means you can catch one of them performing at either Hakkasan or the Wet Republic pool party at least once a month.  In the summer months, all three DJs usually perform here monthly.  I caught Tiesto yesterday at Wet Republic and had a blast.. . MGM has a pretty large pool complex with a lazy river that is available to hotel guests for free.  MGM's casino has a large array of slots and table games if that's your thing.  Finally, the only downside of this place is that it is so large it feels like it takes forever to walk to anything.
Great experience. My bf and I stayed at MGM for 2 nights and had a blast! I had stayed at the MGM years ago as a kid and expected the rooms to be outdated, but on the contrary the rooms, gaming floors, and restaurants were very contemporary and exceeded expectations. . . MGM has a large pool facility including a lazy river for only guests to use. The pools are  adjacent to the Wet Republic Day Club and while I was using the pool, Steve Aoki was at Wet Republic spinning away. The music could be heard but at a distant level, providing background music to to the area. Once I got up to leave, I walked around the facility which was when I discovered the lazy river. If I did not have dinner plans, I would have definitely tried it out!. . Hakkasan for my favorite dutch duo, W&W. My bf and I were both on the guestlist but were told that we had to be at the venue by 10PM when the club opens at 10:30PM. We decided to just get tickets which were $20 for female and $30 for male - and these tickets guaranteed our entrance without having to deal with a rowdy crowd to get in. After arriving at around 1:30AM, there was no line at the door and we were in within 2 minutes. The club and decor is pretty standard, the sound system was average, but definitely still a great time. . . MGM also has a large gaming space comparatively to newer hotels, which is perhaps one of the aspects to how they maintain their competitive advantage. With a wide variety of gaming tables and slots, I would not hesitate to recommend this place to a friend who enjoyed a good round of blackjack or craps.. . The only con about this hotel is that the location is a bit further from the center of the strip and would require more walking which I am normally fine with. But in 100 degree weather, walking in the heat may become tiresome and exhausting. . . I would definitely come back to MGM for another stay and would also recommend this hotel to a friend!
Staff is the most dis genuine I've ever dealt with in the service industry. The stars are only for the amenities in the Stay well room. Will be filing my complaints with the BBB. We checked out early it was that frustrating.
Other than the insanely long check-in lines and too much space around the room doors ( leading to lots of hallway noise coming in the room, especially the rattling every time someone came in or not of nearby rooms), most of my negatives are personal in nature, so YMMV. . . It's just too big, even compared to other big hotels on the strip. I got tired of spending a half-hour a day just walking the same treks through the hotel and casino just getting to and from our room. . . Crowd was particularly young, loud, and drunk. Again - might be a bonus for some, but I'm just old and crabby enough that it was grating after a while. Mostly I don't care, of course - except for the aforementioned hallway noise, and the fact that you can't float down the lazy river when people are camped out with their drinks. . . There were also HUGE crowds of conventioneers in the MGM that created lines of  50+ people at each Starbucks, so I'd check that first before booking again. We had to get in an almost scary crunch of people at the elevators one day as the convention let out.. . Buffet was meh; little bakery was good; crepes/froyo place was nice. Easy to find a beer to walk around with. . . Location on the monorail was nice.
I am a part of a company meeting here, would not normally stay here on my own. After 15 hours of meetings today, my keycard to my room would not work.  They made me wait in line behind all the other people checking in (def not bringing the same $$$ to them as my company) for 20 minutes before my card could be reprogrammed.. . 30 minutes later: the poor woman who met with my contempt for being made to wait in line gave me a $50 credit at the bar. Decent forgiveness, but not nearly the same as just getting my keycard reprogrammed as a priority.
Staying two nights, i really satisfied with the staffs, location, facilities as a tourist.. . STAFFS: They are super nice from beginning to the end. Calling for the reservations, i got the best service in my LV tours of my life. She was super nice with the cheerful voice explaining everything. I was very excited as i arrived the hotel expecting nice things while i staying here. Also i got the best service from the front desk. They make things easier. I was arrived earlier than i reserved. Unlike other hotels, they gave me the room key immediately.. . LOCATION: This hotel is located at the center of the Strips and every hotel is a walking distance. If you don't drive your car, no problem to go visit anywhere. . . FACILITES: This hotel has everything. If you want a morning coffee. There are many cafes from Starbucks to McDonald. They have so many kinds of restaurant. That is why i only stayed and ate every meal from McDonald to Hakkasan. This hotel is prodigious and also has many rooms, entertains. Even though i am not a gamble person, i enjoyed staying here having relaxation, eating, sleeping and going the show like KA.
We were traveling with our kids and it was the perfect hotel for them. Great pool and food court. Good dining options. In many hotels you feel like kids are a nuisance to to others but not here. . Check out took about 45 minutes but remember this is the largest hotel in Vegas so that is to be expected. Check out was a breeze. Friendly staff, good size room.. We typically like mid-strip so this was a bit far down for us but ok for the 2 nights we stayed. The only downfall is the size of the hotel, it is huge so you have to walk a long way to get anywhere although Grand tower wasn't bad. Cable went out a few times but not for long. Also, be prepared as Valet takes a LONG time to get your car. Bell desk was amazing and prompt. . If you are military they give you 25% off in food court - HUGE discount! . Good place if you have the kids along for a short stay!
We booked into MGM for five nights over the 4th July long weekend and honestly cannot fault the service we received from the hotel and casino staff.. . Our reservations were made through Trivago so we got a great deal on a West Wing King room. Yes, it is a small apartment. Yes, the bathroom is directly to your right (or left depending) as you walk in with no door to speak of and yes- no mini bar BUT- the furnishings are modern and look brand new. The room was impeccably clean and the bed super comfortable although our view wasn't the best.. . After one night in our room we had a friend decide to come and stay with us so we went down to the check-in counter to see if we could secure him a room. The lovely desk lady offered us an upgrade for only $30 and we ended up in a Grand Queen on the 17th floor with an amazing view of New York New York.. . Obviously the MGM has some issues eg. long check-in line, key cards that will stop working if placed near credit cards or phones etc but for such a massive hotel/casino/entertainment precinct I feel that is totally insignificant. The amenities are excellent, the staff courteous and genuinely helpful/sympathetic to your needs and the Casino itself boasts some of the best restaurants, bars, nightclubs and pool parties you can find in Vegas.. . Anyone who says otherwise is just a whiner...
Ok. Damn. That's the first thing I could think to say. I've been here an hour and I already feel like I need my review started because there's so much already going through my head. Not in the best way either. I liked the fact that "check in" was right through the door instead of like some places where you get dropped off and have to go on a mission to find where you check in. You walk in and there it is. Despite it being 10:00pm there was a line to check in. It went so quick though. Plenty of people working. I have no complaints except for the fact they charge $200 for incidentals. That's quite a bit. I got totally lost trying to find the "Grand Tower" because the instructions I was given at the front desk were horrible. Other than those issues check in was fine. My room is on the 10th floor room 516. This whole place is a maze. When you finally find your tower you have another mission to find your elevators! Once you find those and get to your floor you come a circle and in each direction going all around is a series of hallways. Once you figure out what hallway to go you end up going down and hallway never ends it seems like. I felt like I was walking the green mile or something. It took forever to get to my room. The ice machine is located in the "300" hallway so you have a quite always to get ice. I think each hallway should have an ice machine at least halfway down because there's about 150 rooms in one hallway! . . The room is so small. The other hotels I've stayed at have larger and more cozy rooms. They have the "bathroom" to your immediate right when you come in. The vanity area is very small. They have the toilet in a little room by itself kinda like its a public bathroom. Next to it is the shower. The shower is awesome though. Great water temp and pressure and very spacious. The TV has a lot of channels but the signal goes out quite a bit which is annoying. The bed though OMG! It was like sleeping on a cloud. So comfy! The pillows were great. I had a king bed with 4 huge heavy pillows that you melt into once your head hits them. The mattress, the sheets and the comforter were so soft! I loved that bed and I wanted to take it with me. I will admit as my stay went on the room grew on me a bit. . . The casino was huge. It took me a couple of days to start figuring out where everything was and still found myself getting lost at times. Plenty of places to eat and a wide variety of table games and slots. Plenty to do. They closed the pool on one of the days and it figures it was on the day I planned to enjoy the pool after my spa visit. It was a little rainy out and they closed it over that! Very stupid and dramatic if you ask me. I also loved the fact that in the lobby of my tower was a 24 hour convenient store with all the odds and ends you might need for your trip. Gambling here was great and I met some awesome dealers. Specifically Vic and Niegel. I would come here again just to play at their table. . . Like most Vegas hotels this one had it;s good and bad. The good seemed to outweigh the bad and I would stay here again.
My two kids (ages 8 and 15) and I chose the MGM Grand during the week (Mon-Thurs), to check out their lazy river. Usually we stay at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. We drove all around the huge complex until we stumbled across an employee who directed us to the front of the hotel. We pulled in and had our luggage loaded up and checked in to the bell station. I felt the bell man pressured me into tipping him because he kept saying "I won't see you again". He wasn't the person who takes your luggage to your room, that's another person. Ok, so now we have to check in, the line took about 45 minutes (at 5pm, check in at 3), but was at least moving and good music videos on huge screens kept us entertained. On to the room, pretty nice and easy to find. Clean and cool with a decent strip view. Could never figure out the mini fridge, but the blackout shade was awesome. The room smelled smoky from time to time which was gross and although the rooms were straightened up and decent each day, housekeeping must not have a vacuum because anything that fell on the floor or was there when we got there, stayed there all week. The pool, sadly, was a disappointment. The check in at the entrance was just a flash of the room card and then we made a beeline to the lazy river. We rented tubes that were HUGE and $10 each for the day, only credit or room charge, no cash. We ended up getting one tube taken from us when we went into another pool, but because of the size we were actually relieved. The lazy river was not all that was promised. It reeked of chlorine, our eyes burned all night. Drunk adults lined the entire mile blocking the fun of a pool that carries you through. Me and my kids were pushed hard at different times by adults who were walking through the river like they were rushing to get somewhere. The entire pool was lined with empty beer cans and bottles that fell into the pool! There were also lots of folks walking through the lazy river holding their cans and bottles just above the water. We enjoyed the regular pools better but those were lined with beer cans and bottles too. I don't care that folks are drinking, it's Vegas, but they should have at least one person on staff to scoop that mess up all day. A lightening storm cut our pool time short and we never returned to the pools again. We tried to eat at the Rainforest Cafe but the wait was 2.5 hours. So, we drove south of the strip to a variety of other casual dining spots all week. The Avenue Cafe in the MGM was ok. $60 for an omelette, kid's waffle and a BLT. Clean. Nothing but eggs after noon, no other breakfast items available. Best meal was Bucca de Beppo at the Excalibur (yucky hotel and people, but great food and server named David). Must buy/try are cupcakes from the Corner Cakes in the MGM Grand Tower. All in all, not bad, but we'll be sticking with Mandalay Bay for our family-friendly Vegas jaunts.
There are ONLY three reasons why people stay at this hotel: 1. It's CHEAP 2. Sporting Events 3. They don't know any better. We stayed here for a week with our company and it was the worst. Bad food, poor customer service, dirty rooms and a lot of working girls. Spend the money and get a better experience. Room service delivered cold. Left the room from 11a - 8pm and the room was never cleaned. Called the "Hotel Manager" and it still took 5 hours and 6 additional calls to finally have the room cleaned.  So sad how far the MGM has fallen.
Didn't get a chance to stay here but I did play here!  Some of the friendliest blackjack dealers I have played with.  Makes a big difference.  3/2 blackjack is important to anyone who is series about the game.  Nice shops, good food choices, friendly service people, clean casino.  Connected to New York New York via walkway.  I will play here again.
I can't believe the pool closes at 8pm during summer time. We have to get the mini bar refrigerator unlocked and I understand that it has a sensor and that we have to pay for whatever we take from the mini bar but they should at least provide a small refrigerator for the guests. Oh wait! They do have refrigerators to offer the guests but they will charge $25/night. I can smell the chlorine coming out of the shower heads also and its way too strong. I've been to one of the best hotels here and I thought that this hotel will be better than the other 4-5 star hotels we stayed at.
I have stayed here several times and loved the service. This last time, we checked in and got the key to our room we found  "guests" still in the room smoking in a non smoking room and waiting for the bus boy to arrive for pick up. We had to wait in the casino until the staff cleaned up the mess! This is not acceptable with an MGM property. The management did issue me and the wife a coupon for the buffet for the convenience, but still disappointed.
Awesome casino associated with Mlife hotel chain. Satdown to play blackjack a few times. The dealers I encountered were great to talk to and made the experience that much better. Cocktail girls came in a timely fashion and drinks were good. The only down side isn't even too bad. I can't hold this against them because this is the design casinos should have BUT, it is soooooo easy to get lost. I had no trouble running into blackjack tables and slots. But trying to walk through the hotel to the strip...impossible. But again, that's how they want it. Easy to get in, tough to leave. All in all, some good times here. Would recommend as a stop for some gaming.
The Good:. Beds are comfy.. TV is big and nice.. Clean room.. Good amount of channels..  . The Bad:. Premium view rooms extremely rare.. Wifi is horrible.. Outside noise comes in.. Ethernet doesn't work.. 2 lamps didn't work.. Television loses connection a lot.. Televison remote is double clicks and is slow.. Extra fridge for rent is around 20 a night.. Ice machine empty at times. . The green lights on the mgm at night are blinding and also make pictures impossible.. Tech support wait is long.. Busy hotel.. . I have stayed here a couple times now. And what I have learned is that this hotel is not worth the price.. They will get you to love it the first time. But after that it goes down hill.. Out of all my stays here, I have never received a premium view. One trip I asked almost every week day for one. Come to find out that it is rare to get one without booking through their website. Wifi disconnects and tech support takes forever to get ahold of.
The last 2 times that I've overnighted in Vegas, I've stayed at the MGM. My most recent visit was for 3 nights over the 4th of July weekend; 03July-06July.  . . This hotel is always "poppin", and 4th of July weekend was insane.  If you're as big a fan as I am of people watching, then you're in luck. . . I didn't have to bother with the check-in process, someone else in my group handled that, so I cannot speak on that aspect.  We'd driven in from the Phoenix area, arrived around 5pm, I dropped them off at the front door to check in, and by the time I'd parked they were calling me from our room, so that was pretty fast IMO. . . . Hotel.... . lobby: . Huge, bright lobby with large TVs over the check-in desks.  The TVs are usually playing music videos (to my delight, as I prance-dance through the lobby).  The large boxing ring, which houses a large gold lion statute, is a popular attraction for photo ops.  If you want a photo of the Lion in Ring sans a million strangers in your backdrop, I suggest getting down to the lobby before 8am...while everyone else is still hungover and asleep. . . Note: It was freezing in the hotel hallways!. . . Workout facility:. on the 4th floor, if I recall correctly.  You'll need your room key to enter.  Nice, clean, simple little workout room.  Lots of treadmills (I didn't count them; maybe a dozen?), stair-stepper, and other equipment. It was well stocked with lots of clean towels, and it had 2 filtered water coolers.  . . . Rooms:. Follow the yellow brick road (overhead signs) to the guest rooms.  From the lobby, take a quick right, walk through a short hall (cupcakery to the left, convenience store to the right), until you reach the rotunda with the large fountain in the middle.  From here there are different pathways, above which you'll see where they lead.  Proceed accordingly.  (FYI If you are told to go to a room, for example, 401, do not assume it's on the 4th floor. Verify which floor, b/c there is a (for example) 401 on all the floors.). . We had a room on the 10th floor with 2 queen beds. The room was spacious, but not as large as the room we had here last year. Same comfy beds though!. I'm not sure why the bathroom being at the door is such a focal point for some.  With as many people as I've seen stumbling through the lobby, barely making it to the elevator, I'd think the bathroom being at your instant disposal would be a good thing.. . The bathrooms are large and clean.  I like that there is a wall separating the commode from the sink area.. . The maid service was great.  She kept us stocked on extra towels.. Tip: Tip the maids a little every day ($2 per day if it's just you or +1; $1 per person if there's a group of you), especially if you're staying multiple days.  You'll be rewarded!  . . The city lights can be bright at night, but they have blackout curtains in the rooms, so just close the curtains and nighty-night.  There is nothing that you can do about the noise in the halls though.  Dude; it's Vegas.. . I don't watch TV when I'm in Vegas, so I don't know what the TV service is like. . However, there was an outlet center on TV stand, which included 2 USB ports; great for charging our iPhones. . . I wish they would switch from glass drinking glasses to individually wrapped, disposable plastic cups.  Those glasses are unsanitary. . . If you call guest services to request they bring you anything, call WAY before you need it. It took them almost 2 hours to bring us extra blankets one night. . . . Casino:. I do not drink or gamble.  However, it was very smokey while walking through.  I wish they'd incorporate a no-smoking policy. But I know they're afraid to lose money.. . . Food courtyard:. McDonald's and the pizza place (forgot the name) were open at 2:30am one night, and it was packed!. . Other options during the day were Asian (think Panda Express, but the name was different), Mexican (burritos, tacos, etc), Southern USA (fried chicken, mac n cheese, etc).  Aside from steamed veggies at the Asian option, nothing else was vegan-friendly.. . Pool:. You'll need your MGM room key to enter, otherwise YOU SHALL NOT  PASS.. Clean towels available, so no need to bring your own.. Arrive early for a lounge chair (and some peace and quiet). Small humans (children) take over by midday. . Pool closes at 8pm, so no late night dips for you.. There are different areas, and they're all huge.  You have to pay extra to chill in the lazy pool. :(. I think there were at least 2 restaurants inside the pool area. I didn't visit them, so I have no comment.. You can NOT bring your own water bottle into the pool area, so when (not if; when) you get thirsty, be prepared to spend $6 on a baby bottle of water. . . . Entertainment:. I went to see Cirque du Soleil's KA performance, which was outstanding!  Fun, truly entertaining, eye-catching performance.  Absolutely loved it!  The auditorium is lovely as well, and it wasn't too cold inside. There's a concession stand, but I didn't visit it.. . . We got to view/rate a TV pilot, which was cool.
On my way to the poker room :) This is the best casino eva people. Come play with me here. I bet you have a ball!. That's what I do when I'm here! Party over here & party over at tha pool. This casino is ok I give it five stars total. I'm here often! I like to pretend I'm famous when I'm here..  I even went to my eye doctor and got cool poker shades to gamble here. . This place is a pure party. I mean it's everything VEGAS is famous for but when I'm here I am in the building for hours its like a 2nd home. Yelp! And lucky me...what happeneds in Vegas stays in Vegas. This is one casino where u really can win. No funny monkey business this place rocks! Look the food is great. The employees are kind and fun. Its nothing like being around people who love they job. They make it fun. They don't try and rip you off. Its packed with security so you feel safe. Its even spots tocharge ya phone or at least I found secret spots to charge my phone. (Giggles) I have been like 10 days in a row thus far I am beyond addicted. The employees tell me I should gamble responsibly. I tell them well bring this gamble responsibly to the table I will sure gamble with him or her. (kmsl)
Really, the only complaint I have about the hotel is that there isn't a coffee maker in the room.  I know this may seem silly but I like my morning cup of coffee before I shower, just as I'm waking up.  It's a bit of a pain to have to get washed up & dressed to go downstairs to buy a cup of coffee.  Also, it would have been nice if breakfast was included
I stated in an executive king suite which was fun for a weeknight price. I was excited about the pool, but it was underwhelming. I did not regret staying here once, but would probably stay at aria or Cosmo next time.. One gripe I have about all Vegas rooms I have seen is that the mini bar takes up the entire fridge so you cannot cool the drinks you bought on the cheap at CVS.
Briefly visited the MGM to see a concert. Hotel itself is large and a little plain in terms of decor. The concert venue was excellent - clean, good seating arrangement, comfortable seats, and easy to navigate. The staff were also very friendly and helpful.
Follow the yellow brick road to the emerald city and you'll find the golden lion! It's the first thing you see as you enter the main lobby.. . This hotel is pretty grand, alright, at least in size. Being the largest hotel and casino in Las Vegas, maybe they feel they don't need to be the best in customer service. Granted, there were over 15,000 people from my company for a huge convention, but they should be equipped to handle as many guests as can fit in the hotel, right? They're just lucky the other 15,000 people went elsewhere.. . Need to Spend $?. ---------------------. Plenty of restaurants, touristy shops, and of course... massive casino space. Many vehicles for spending dolla bills! The food court gets wicked crowded so I tended to opt for **Blizz**, which is just around the corner and has some healthy juice options (see Blizz review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/blizz-las-vegas?hrid=9pL5NN9VJ-YEqvD0mBJjBA). Also MGM is home to **Cirque Du Soleil's 'Ka'**. Not my favorite Cirque show, but still an interesting one. My favorite Cirque show is the Beatles' 'LOVE', which you can only catch in Las Vegas. (see LOVE review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?hrid=FBWaEYnI5TPtpuBeePDZdA).. . Need to Catch Some Sun?. -------------------------------. They have not one, not two, but FOUR pools! If those weren't enough fun for you, they have 3 whirlpools and waterfalls too. It's a 6.5 acre complex of pool action and also includes a quarter mile lazy river. As if you hadn't already consumed enough food and alcohol, they have 5 bars and a full service Cabana grill. You can even get a poolside massage. What?!. . Need to Feel Large and In Charge?. ----------------------------------------. The **MGM Grand Garden Arena** is there for you! When you're here, you can't help but feel the power and energy of thousands of people in one space. Amazing sound systems and visual effects really enhance the experience. If your company is cool enough to play EDM (electronic dance music) for 5 hours, I can guarantee you'll have a great time here. Arena staff are friendly and helpful, which is a huge contrast compared to much of the hotel.. . Need to Dance?. -------------------. Other than partying with my company's EDM fix, you can also hit up **Hakkasan**, one of the hottest nightclubs in Vegas. No wonder this place won the title of "#1 Nightclub in the World" by Playboy Magazine. All the top DJ's spin here, including resident DJ's Tiesto and Calvin Harris. Then of course there's also **Wet Republic** at the ultra pool, complete with the resident DJ's, a newly expanded 95-foot bar (neverending alcohol), a huge LED display, party cabanas/bungalows, and of course tons of people ready to party in their bathing suits. A super fun day party! (see Wet Republic review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/wet-republic-ultra-pool-las-vegas?hrid=KRe8TmiGoVdgNzKIFNxjgw). . All in all, the MGM Grand has a LOT to offer. Just wish their customer service could keep up.. . TIP: Be prepared when asking for extra towels. Staff may sound as shocked as if you had asked for their firstborn child.. . DATE TIP: Plenty of venues here for a hot date!
Where do I begin? . 1st room- Had a REALLY bad window view for the amount of money we paid for. I left home for a VACATION not a view of roofs. NOT only it had a bad view it took FOREVER! to walk to our room from the Elevator. My family is handicap so it was very hard for us to get to the room. So we switched.. . 2nd room- The view got better, although you could still see the view of roof tops at least I could see that seattle thingy and some other gold building. The windows were cool I liked playing with the shades. The air conditioning was NOT COOL! We're in LV we need the air condition to work!!! The room was SO HOT! and standing in the hallway would've been a lot more refreshing! This second room was a lot easier for us to get to! it was closer to the elevator~ yay!. . POOL- THE POOL WAS SO FREAKING FAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got to say walking there before you went to the pool wasn't as embarrassing as walking back from the pool! Not only the walk was long! Can you imagine walking all wet? AND they didn't let you take the towel back with you to cover you up! Lucky I brought my own towel. So if you do go to the pool keep in mind that your going to go through the walk of shame and embarrassment! Bring a T-shirt or Towel of your OWN! to the pool. The pool was VERY packed! and it was super hot! They had 4 different pools and sadly I went around 5ish and they closed the other 2 pools ): So I didn't get to see how those were. . . Overall, would I stay here again? Maybe not... unless i would like to experience the walk or shame and embarrassment again.
This is a huge hotel! It is the third-largest hotel in the world with over 5,000 rooms. Consequently it can get quite chaotic, especially during check-in. That said, the rooms are very nice, the service is excellent, and there is a complete variety of food options from McDonalds in the food court, to multiple very high-line restaurants serving almost anything you would like to try. . The garage and rooms are a very long walk, but overall, I was very satisfied with our two nights stay. We will definitely be back.. The location on strip is very convenient, and the access to the monorail system also eases the pain. I didn't need the car while we were there.
Really liked the MGM, team was great.  Bell service and ballet were awesome, they even tried to recruit me after we retire.  We had to pay for a fridge which I thought was crazy, especially what we paid for the room.  No microwave, I really was unpleased with that.  I was never offered a drink when I was at the tables, not cool.  Otherwise, great hotel.  The pool was very nice, hot and sexy girls...
First night- check into a stay well grand queen suite. Those nasty little escort cards were taped to the window, toilet was broken (never fixed), & we requested extra towels which we never received.. Second night, upgraded to the 2 bedroom Skyline Marquee Suite for that night and the next. No hot water in one of the restrooms. Call and talk to the front desk 4-5 times over the next couple of hours and they kept saying "it was in the process of being fixed". Nobody ever showed up. So we paid over $1k for a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom suite and only got a 2 bed 1&1/2 bath. Also, my friend that was staying with me had someone spill red wine on his suit, he called and talked to them and they said they would come take his suit and get it cleaned for him. Good thing we didn't hold our breath because...  Surprise, they never showed up.. The lack of customer service was astounding.
I found the Hotel nice and clean but I noticed the aircondition is not enough for the hot weather. I give it 3 star because the customer service is so helpful and and the pool was amazing
Arrived here at the MGM today for my daughters wedding and so disappointed with our room.  We had requested a strip view and was thrilled at check in to find out that we were upgraded to a strip room but it was still being cleaned. After waiting for an hour and a half I asked if my room was ready and they said no but they could put me in a mountain view room right away and I said I would rather wait for the strip view. Finally my room was ready and was disappointed that it was a view of the airport!!!! After making several calls they would not accommodate me.  I just don't get it.
Beautiful hotel, but average for the facilities. The bathroom doesn't have an air vent and the hotel does not provide any complimentary coffee makers. C'mon, even motels provide those.. . Overall, the room was clean and the view was great. The beds are comfortable too.
Tons of teenage brat kids running around everywhere Wi-Fi doesn't work TV cuts in and out not a very good stay not a very good room!
Wonderful hotel with terrible customer service. We came back to hotel after catching a show around 12 AM, and neither of our keys worked. We then went into a neighbors room to call the front desk, and we waited on hold for 10 minutes. The representative who helped us was rude and unapologetic and said someone would be up in 15 minutes to let us in. No one ever showed after waiting for 30 minutes, and we had to walk all the way back down to the front desk and wait for assistance. We were locked out of our room for a total of an hr. Really huge buzzkill and not what I would expect from a resort at this price point, extremely disappointed.
I just got back from the MGM and overall had a satisfactory experience.  Not great, not horrible.  Pretty average.. . I had my 6 year old with me so granted I was not looking to do any gambling or nightlife this trip.  What I was looking for was a fun pool for he and I to play in and a good location to get to the things we wanted to do.  . . The pool is large and honestly, we never had any trouble finding deck chairs whether we went down in the morning or the late afternoon.  I did find that the Lazy River runs out of inner tubes to rent pretty quickly so that was disappointing.  As was the fact that the largest pool and the Lazy River don't open until 10 AM and the Lazy River closes at 6 instead of 8 like the other pools.  . . Also, there isn't much in the way of exhibits or entertainment for kids under 12 (minimum age for their CSI Experience) so we ended up going over to the Mandalay Bay, Excalibur, NYNY and the Luxor to play in the arcades and see their exhibits (Titanic, Shark Reef, etc.). . The room was clean and spacious and there is definitely a big variety of kid-friendly dining options at the MGM.  I should mention that the MGM advertises free WiFi and I could get my phone and iPad to find the MGM WiFi signal but I couldn't get online using their WiFi ever.  And the TV will randomly lose signal in the middle of a show....A LOT.  But if you just click the channel up one and back down the signal was back.  Not earth-shattering or vacation ruining by any means.  Just super annoying and worth mentioning I think.
MGM grand is a middle range hotel when it comes to selecting between all the resort hotels on the strip.  It is not as expensive as the Bellagio and it is nicer than some of the older hotels located on the north strip like Circus Circus or the Flamingo.. . The room rate is average but you should be aware of a few charges that are not advertised on the front page of your reservation.  There will be a resort fee which is mainly for the wifi but I imagine it covers other costs like pool admission etc.  This fee for us was $25.  When it comes to the wifi you will have to reconnect to it throughout the day as you go to and from your room and throughout the MGM resort.  It also worked at the Bellagio as this is a MGM brand resort.  So in all the wifi can be convenient at times and inconvenient during others.. . *Other room charges to be aware of are not really charges but deposits.  You may see a credit card charge for a couple hundred dollars more than they tell you at the front desk but this is a security deposit for the room.  Once you check out and everything is checked in the room you will get this money back.  . . The MGM is branded by their bronze lion.  The huge bronze lion at the front of the building, in the main lobby, and on the elevator doors.  You won't miss it and will be familiar with it by the end of your stay.  . . MGM was the best choice for us and I was extremely happy with our stay.  The room we had looked exactly like it was shown online and was very clean.  Room service was daily and tremendously efficient.  They even lined up my shoes for me. They knew exactly what to touch and throw away and what not to.  I was really happy to find my things taken care of as I would.  . . MGM, like all of the resorts, provides with anything and everything you need so there is no need to ever leave the huge resort.  They have restaurants, shops, entertainment, pool, gambling, night club, literally everything.  Not only did I love the resort in general but it was great to be able to go to Hakkasan and Wet Republic within your own resort.  I imagine the other night clubs and day clubs are fun as well but again it is so convenient to have these options within walking distance.  I say walking distance because these resorts are ginormous and what may look like across the street or down the way on Google Maps is actually a 10-15 minute walk.  To walk the whole strip is really not feasible.  . . I can go on and on but many of my rants and raves about MGM will take place in my reviews for all of the specific entities within the resort.
MGM Hotel rooms to me are HORRIBLY designed. It's as if the rooms are tiny offices and it was put together by all the "left overs." Whoever designed this hotel is a horrible designer. I wouldn't recommend this hotel only because of the rooms. If you're looking for a great hotel on the strip. I recommend New York New York. It beautiful, they have so much to give, and the rooms are so comfortable.
I've stayed at the MGM a few times but never have I been so disappointed with my stay until this past weekend. First, I linked my reservation and my friend's reservation a week prior so we can have rooms next to each other. I understand this is hard to accomodate due to the high volume of customers, but I did not appreciate the front desk lying to my friend and telling her that the reservations are not linked when they are. Second, we booked our rooms at the MGM this weekend because we had an offer that gave us entry to Wet Republic and Hakkasan. We arrive at Hakkasan and was told that the offer is not valid on Saturday night. When we checked in, we were told that the offer is valid Thursday - Sunday; I'm pretty sure Saturday is between Thursday - Sunday. We went to the front desk to fix this issue and was told by a very unhelpful manager that there's nothing they can do because Hakkasan is independently owned and the fine print said "offer subject to change." Just a tip, MGM, don't offer your customers offers you can't honor. What I am most disappointed with is that the manager did not even offer to help us contact Hakkasan until I pointed out that the least she can do is pick up the phone and TRY. She did and viola, a member of Hakkasan's team resolved the issue right away. The only thing I was satisfied with this weekend was how Hakkasan handled this situation. . I have never had any of these issues at the Wynn, Encore, Venetian, Palazzo, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, and even Bally's. I am extremely disappointed at MGM's below mediocre customer service. I understand that problms occur, but I do not appreciate being lied to nor do I appreciate a manager that refuses to do the simple act of picking up the phone and at least TRY to help a customer resolve their issues. If you want a hotel that offers below medicore customer service, this place should clearly be your top choice. Never will I, nor any of my guests, stay at the MGM Grand again.
This was a nice hotel maybe ten years ago. Last time I was there guaranteed I will not be back. I have never encountered such surly and unprofessional staff as at the hotel and for what they charge you'd be better off (and better treated) at any local no-tell motel. We paid in advance for tickets to one of their shows and then when we showed up they refused us admission because one of the men in our party was wearing (very upscale, not denim and not short) shorts! This is July in Vegas. It was over 100 degrees! Then they refused to refund our ticket money. I smell a scam, as I have seen this comment in other reviews as well. There is no dress code posted on the web site or anywhere else, and as it happens, the gentleman in our party refused entrance...TO A FREAKING FREAK SHOW...is a professional model who is often paid to attend high-end parties in NY to add high end atmosphere. In short, I will never again set foot in the MGM Grand or any of its affiliated properties. Fortunately I had paid for the tickets by credit card, so when refused a refund I just contacted my bank and stopped the charge (and suggested they take a look at how many other people MGM tries to rip off in this manner). The Excalibur is classier, cleaner and friendlier. That is NOT a compliment.
I am writing in reference to my recent stay on 7/18 - 7/20. I am not one who usually complains or even writes about it, but after thinking and discussing with others, I thought it would be the right thing to let you know that I was not very happy when I left the MGM on 7/20. .  . Everything went well when a friend and I arrived on 7/18. We were welcomed and was told that I would be given a room credit of $50 for it being my birthday. She said I would be able to use it on food or drinks in the MGM and just charge it to the room and it would be deducted. I was very grateful and thanked the lady at the front desk. .  . As soon as we got to the room I noticed 2 things that I should have reported to the front desk and housekeeping, but decided to leave it be because we got in late and with it being my birthday just decided to head down to the casino. .  . 1) The comforter on the bed by the window had some type of red stain on it that crusted. I did not sleep under it and just threw it on the floor and slept under the bed sheets. .  . 2) There were 2 glasses in the bathroom that were definitely not clean. One had fingerprints all over them and the other had some resin around the rim of the cup like someone ate and drank from it and the food stuck. .  . Again, I didn't say anything only because I didn't want to hassle anyone at the MGM and just focused on enjoying my birthday..  . Besides those two things, the room was fine and my next complaint has to do with the checkout process.   .  . I was told that I would receive a $50 credit for food and beverage if charged to my room if purchased in the MGM. When I went to checkout there was a $32 charge for pizza purchased at the MGM food court. The lady I spoke to on the phone said that it has to be an "MGM owned" restaurant and that it does not count. I explained what the front desk lady said and also told her that the receipt and what the charge shows is "MGM Bonannos" and how would I know to differentiate when MGM shows on the receipt. She was willing to work with me and said that she couldn't do anything about the charge and instead refund the resort fees. I was told my balance and thought it was fine but then realized that she only reversed one resort fee instead of both and still was responsible for a fraction of the price of the food I thought would be free..  . I am not complaining for the sake of complaining, but I thought you should know because a lot of people would find the first 2 things very disturbing and refuse to stay there and the other is a matter of principle. I was told one thing and it was not honored and given another option which didn't help me at all. .  . I am a very loyal gambler at the MGM and I do have an Mlife account. This was my first official stay at the MGM and was definitely not pleased. I will say that I usually stay at the Signature but got a better deal here which was the reason I booked it. I come to Vegas about 8-10 times a year for business and leisure and always looking to stay at mlife resorts. After this experience I'm not sure I can stay at the MGM but will still use my MLife card when I am in Vegas. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
The MGM Grand is the third largest hotel in the world.. . Honestly, it's one of the best properties on the strip.  It mixes more casual fare like buffets and chain restaurants with ultra high end fare like Joel Robuchon.  The largest and hottest nightclub in Las Vegas, Hakkasan, is here as well.  You can pair that up with Wet Republic in the day time .... One of the hottest pools.. . And, of course, there's the MGM Grand Garden Arena, where major fight nights and concerts get held on a regular basis.. . There really is something for everyone here.. . If there's one thing missing, it's quality shopping like you can get at Crystals or the Forum Shops.  Luckily, the location of the MGM Grand is also quite good ... It's on a very central area of the strip, which makes it about as easy as it can be in Vegas to hop over to other properties.. . If you are looking for an entirely upscale experience, then this might not be the place for you.  WynnCore might be more up your alley.  But there are some undisputed bests here (like Robuchon and Hakkasan) and, you know what?  Sometimes I want to eat Chicken McNuggets and not have to walk 30 min to another casino to do it.  That's what I like about the MGM.  Variety ... And in a good way.
Had a great time at the Grand! Attended a pro boxing match. Fun time!
Forsta intrycket nar man kommer och checkar in ar att allt ar gigantiskt. In-checkningen fungerar smidigt. Gratis parkering och gratis wi-fi. Stort och rymligt rum med utmarkta sangar. Fantastisk utsikt over hotellen i casino-omradet. Poolomradet ar utmarkt. Nojesutbudet i varldsklass. Stannar tva natter och helhetsintrycket blir dock inte lika bra. Det gar inte undga att man ar mitt i en oken. 43 grader varmt pa dagen och ca 35 pa kvallen gor att man helt haller sig inomhus eller i poolen. Det varsta ar dock att jag aldrig bott pa ett hotell som sa uppenbart ar ute efter att suga sa mycket pengar som mojligt av sina kunder. Det marks inte bara i allt spel utan i affarer. Utcheckningen gor man genom att fylla i en blankett. De drar sidan pengar fran betalkortet som ar mer eller mindre omojligt att verifiera eller an mindre protestera mot. Oppna inte minibaren.
