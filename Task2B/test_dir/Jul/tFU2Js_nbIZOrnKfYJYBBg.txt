When I found out I was going to Vegas for a conference, the first thing I told my travel buddy was "We have to go to Bouchon!" . . As usual, I was not disappointed. We shared beignets and I had the brioche french toast, both of which were incredible. My friend is a pescetarian and the waiter and kitchen were amazingly accommodating with serving her an a la carte breakfast. The coffee was fantastic, and the service was even better. . . Always, always recommended.
Short version: The food is absolutely nothing special. The high prices for what is, at best, Olive Garden quality fare is ridiculous. The food takes ages to arrive. Plus, you may still end up seated next to Vegas a-holes. The only upside is that the servers are friendly and attentive.. . Long version: So my girlfriend, two female colleagues, and I were in Vegas for a conference. We're trying to figure out where to get dinner, and we finally end up at Bouchon. It's a celebrity-chef restaurant in The Venetian. The decor is impressive. The prices are high. The menu is written to get you excited about the food. We were expecting amazing things. The many people on the waitstaff were extremely friendly, so we were even more expectant. We asked that our food - entrees, apps, and sides - be served at the same time. It took 45 minutes for the meal to arrive. And it was so disappointing.. . The onion soup and white sausage entreewere good, nothing terrible, but for an affected, overpriced French "bistro" from a celebrity chef, I was expecting much better than Olive Garden level. Both my colleagues said their main dishes were pretty good but nothing to brag about. One of them also got a side order of $7 "pomme frites." They were plain, bland French fries. The fries at Smashburger put these to shame, for God's sake. My gf got the worst of it. The roasted squash was soggy on top and hard/undercooked on the bottom, and bland all over. The fried zucchini blossoms were inedible oil-sponges. She literally didn't eat them. The salade de tomate was swimming in vinaigrette.. . Then, to add insult to injury, a group of five arrogant dudes and one skank in their late 20s came in. Where do you think they got seated? As far away from all other human beings as possible? Nope. Right next to us. And I do mean "right next." There was hardly any space at all between their table and ours. Tip to the Bouchon hostesses: when a pack of a-hole guys comes in, don't seat them next to a table with three attractive women and one guy. I knew these guys were d-bags the second I saw them, and I was right. They kept staring over, and sure enough, as predicted, one of the scumbags couldn't resist making a loud, inappropriate comment directed at one of the women at our table. Naturally, this p-ssy never, ever would've done that if he had been there by himself, but surrounded by his fellow scum he was brave.. . Nice going, Bouchon. We wait forever for overpriced, mediocre food and end up getting harassed by the sh-tbags you seated right up against our table.
Terrible service and for some reason, brunch was quite disappointing. . . The Croque Madame did not taste as good as it did last time and left a strange after taste.
Food was decent, but nothing life-changing. Yes, I know it's supposed to be "simple French bistro food" and it was ok but.... . Just because Thomas Keller got a lot of money to slap his name on it, you are not really eating at a Thomas Keller resto unless it's French Laundry or Per Se. This is just a very slightly higher-end La Madeleine with inflated Strip hotel prices. . . I gave it two stars because of the noise and flaky service. For food alone I'd easily give three maybe four. It's a cavernous space and they really try to pack 'em in and flip the tables as quickly as possible to generate volume, pretty much the antithesis of a what a genuine, relaxed bistro experience in France is like. The noise level was almost deafening. My dining companion was seated right across from me and we were literally shouting at each other during several points in the meal. A conversation was pretty much impossible and neither of us are hearing-impaired. Although my ears were ringing all that night after...this is absolutely not the place for a relaxed and intimate dinner. Don't be fooled into thinking that just because it's "French" food.. . Courses came out at odd intervals and aside from when it was time for us to pay and run out (flip those tables!) our server just didn't seem to be very good at his job. Maybe he was having an off day, got caught in the weeds...but I honestly think in his case he's just a bad waiter. . . Started with a nice platter of oysters. They didn't make us sick so that's good. Not that I expected them to. . . My dining companion had the roast chicken which really was delicious and so well done. Chicken is usually one of the most boring things to order on any restaurant menu but this is an exception. If you've always wanted to try one of those flavorful, moist classic French roast chickens you've heard are so good, here is a place to start. My trout almandine was quality. Simply prepared and I liked it. The rhubarb cake dessert was tasty.. . This was my first visit back to Bouchon after I had gone several times a few years ago. Prior to that it was always for breakfast and lunch. It's was less crowded and quieter at those times. However, service there has never been especially good and it suffers the endemic Strip celeb chef phoning it in for the tourists problem. . . I'd recommend going for lunch or breakfast (especially during the week if you can swing it) avoiding weekend dinner there and not setting your expectations for food and certainly not for service, all that high.
Perfection on a plate is defined my a flatiron cut, cooked medium rare, topped with slow-cooked onion marmalade, a round if herbed butter, and a pile of salty frites. . . Bouchon is my top five favorite restaurants in Vegas and by far the best resort restaurant. Service is impeccable and servers are super nice and not hoity-toity. Wine selections by the glass make excellent pairings. The oyster bar serves a range of briny to sweet from across the county. The desserts are a perfect finale with the crime brulee being one of the best I've ever had (my apologies to my amazing mother-in-law, you have been de-throned).
This place is very overrated. I went for brunch and my burger was dry, overcooked, just blah. I wanted to send it back but did not see the waiter again and the place was empty. To make it worst I had to eat it with the tap water that was served when we got there because when I asked another waiter for a drink he replied: "I'll let your waiter know". He didn't. I even had walk up to the maitre d to ask for the check! Stay away from this place.
The food was incredible, Foi Graes was to die for.  I wish I could have it everyday, unfortunately SF bans it. . . I had the Bouchon steak, the temperature was perfect and the sauce was so delectable. . . The service was outstanding.  They even have Mac and Cheese for my kid. . . I am definitely coming back for brunch to see if it's even better than dinner.
I started out with the Croque Madame.  It was very good. The mornay sauce was very nice.  The bread seemed excessively buttered. The french fries were plentiful and crispy. They would have been perfect had they not been over-salted.  I hate to admit this but you have to work hard to put too much salt on my food. These were way over-salted. . . The beignets were very nice. The more closely resembled cider mill spice donuts rolled in cinnamon sugar. . . Overall, friendly and attentive, if somewhat slow, service, Beautiful atmosphere,  pricey, but enjoyable. A bit overly decadent for my taste but it was a nice experience.
I love this place. I've been here about 4 times and every experience was pretty nice.. . I would recommend coming here for brunch and breakfast. It's relatively cheap (about 40 dollars for two people) and the food is good. Recently, I ordered the french toast which was really good (about 12 dollars).. . During dinner, for two people the bill was about 200 dollars. However, we ordered quite a lot, including oysters, steak, duck salad, lamb (I think), sparkling water, truffle fries and dessert. The ambiance is dark and romantic, but honestly, I believe there's better value for dinner elsewhere and the food good, just didn't have a wow factor. That being said, I still had a good time and the service was excellent. . . One bonus is that at night, after dinner you can take a little stroll through their pool area right outside Buchon. It's quite nice and quiet.. . Overall verdict, come here for breakfast and brunch. I don't believe they take reservations for brunch.
Since we were staying at the Venetian, the kids wanted to go to Bouchon for brunch...anticipating a long line, 3 of us headed out first.  We went down to the Casino level and walked through the Casino, past the front desk, into the hallway, then up the elevator and down another hall.  No one else was in line, however, they had to get the table ready, so there was a short wait.  Since the World Cup was being played, we didn't mind waiting and watched the TV in the waiting area.. Our table was ready just as the rest of the group arrived so we were seated... nice restaurant...The menu was quite extensive...lots of choices in oysters and lots of fancy offerings.  Fois gras pate, selection of oysters (for breakfast?), fresh fruit was shared by the group....I just split a corned beef and eggs with my son's girlfriend..I really enjoyed that!. My husband had the sour dough waffles, (I don't like sour dough so I didn't bother).  My daughter had the chicken and waffles...her waffles was good with bacon and chives...the chicken was roast chicken thigh and wing.... Service was good and at the end, the waiter offered us water and coffee to go...I thought that was really nice...and since I had a Kouig Amann waiting for me in the room, I accepted a cup of coffee....they don't serve Kouig Amann's int he restaurant, but he did find out how to pronounce it....sounds like "queen a mahn"....so now you have it!
I came to Bouchon last night for their Bastille Day special menu.  It was a grand meal.  I was brought their pain d'epi with some butter and the small bowl of pistachios.  I love this bread and I have to take care I don't overdo it.. . My server was Amy and she was a gem!!  I asked her about the size of the Bastille Day menu dishes and she explained they were all appetizer size.  I ordered a half dozen oysters, an order of pommes frites aux truffes, and The Saucisson platter.  . . The oysters came 2 each of three different areas from which they were harvested.  Next up was the sausage assortment that came on a board.  There was one horizontally sliced piece of their bratwurst on a small bed of sauerkraut, 2 rounds of Merguez, a slice of garlic sausage en croute, and one link of their boudin blanc.  The sausages were accompanied by some whole grain mustard, some yellow mustard, a couple of cornichons, and some pickled onion slices and other small vegetables pieces.  With the platter, I was brought more bread (3 kinds), and then came the pommes frites.. . It was a feast.  The sausages were all very good.  It would be a fantastic platter to serve any day but this is special for Bastille Day.. . After this, I ordered Chocolate Bouchons for dessert.  These were one of their dessert specials for the night.  I didn't see macarons as was stated online when I read about their special menu for the day.  The Bouchons were small, vertical brownies with a small scoop of ice cream with coconut, one fresh cheerry dipped in chocolate and chilled before serving.  There was also some raspberry syrup on the plate.  The Bouchons were great.. . I have an affair with Bouchon.  I have been there several times and I just like the bistro atmosphere and looking out the window and seeing that lovely park area with pools on the 10th floor of the building that's so private and away from the rest of the Venetian/Venezia/Palazzo Resort.  Bouchon has been the place I've reviewed the most.  It's one of those places that just puts a smile on my face and I look forward to going there.  Service is always first rate and the food is very good.. . I think I have a new Bastille Day tradition that started last night!
What a nice breakfast this was. Beignets with chocolate spread and a latte per the servers advice. We even got a complimentary yogurt parfait which was a nice treat. Followed this with the omelet special of the day and it was all great. Very calm and casual with great food and great service.
I enjoyed it.  Made a list-minute reservation and ate at the bar.  Apparently even if you check in with the host, sitting at the bar cancels your open table reservation/points,  so I had to clear that up. . . I tried some really rich food here:  escargot, moules-frites, and this delicious bread that soaked up all the juices that surrounded the two.  They also bring you some pistachios to enjoy before your meal.. . My food came out very quickly.  I had a couple beers to wash it all down. . . The bartender was nice enough- not super chatty, nor extroverted, but nice. He was kind enough to let me order a half-order of the mussels.  . . Would I go back again?  I'm not sure......there are SO many good venues to try in Vegas...
I rarely love a breakfast enough to pay over $10. This is the exception. Baked goods excellent. Bread perfect. Excellent combinations.
This place lives up to every expectation I have of Thomas Keller.  Simple food done extremely well.  Excellent service, beautiful restaurant and every dish was the best I've ever tasted.  Truly exceptional.
Dinner here is on par with a religious experience.. If Thomas Keller is a god, then our server, Michael, is one of his disciples- professional, personable, and an absolute pleasure. He has worked here since the day they opened, and gave genuine and honest recommendations for our first visit. . . WHAT YOU MUST GET IS THE MOELLE ROTIE- my introduction to bone marrow, which is now my new absolute favorite thing in the known universe. Words cannot fully capture the flavors but as Michael put it in his recommendation, it's "stupid good!", no joke. . . OEUFS MIMOSA-delicious and delicate deviled eggs, damn good with crispy capers and a perfectly creamy texture.. SOUPE a L'OIGNON- true French onion soup, with beef broth and day-long-sauteed onions, topped with two cheeses. It's like drinking a steak, it's so rich.. ESCARGOTS a LA BOURGUIGNONNE- snails in parsley-garlic butter and puff pastry, heavenly and delicate, will be craving these again soon.. STEAK FRITES- upgrade to truffle fries and thank me later, this is the classic french take on steak and potatoes and it is phenomenal.. . Pay attention to the specials, as they had a lamb chop that blew our minds with a fabulous ratio of juicy meat and flavorful fat with just a touch of char, served on a  bean and veggie blend that perfectly balanced the richness of the meat.. . Also got a dessert special, brownies shaped like wine corks served with coconut ice cream and a chocolate covered cherry and a smear of sauce. Perfect with cappuccinos.. . The food and the service both exceeded my expectations in the best of ways. I will be seeking out future events worthy of celebrating with Mr. Keller's creations and crew again soon!
I gave this restaurant 2 stars because my husband's main course, (Gigot d'Agneau) was wonderful -- but mine, (Steak Frites) was awful. (I rarely do this, but in retrospect, I should have sent the dish back.) Not sure what happened here, since it is a simple and classic preparation -- but I needed a new, sharper knife to cut the meat and, even then, it was a sad and tough thing, permeated with connective and vascular tissue. A nice pink hangar steak, it nonetheless was flavorless and disappointing, served with a pile of unremarkable frites that were saved by truffle bits and oil. That said, our first courses of Beignets de Fleurs de Courgettes, Salade de Tomates and Pate de Campagne were all delicious and beautifully presented. Also, a good word needs to be put in for our server, who was attentive, warm and knowledgeable in every respect, including wine recommendations. He brought us a complimentary pineapple-lemon tart, a nice gesture, but far too tart to eat beyond a few bites.  Reading all the other reviews here, it seems we hit on a bit of bad luck, but since there are so many dining options on the Strip, I doubt we will return to Bouchon Bistro nor recommend it.
Came here with a group of 12 for a birthday dinner. Waitstaff and service was excellent. bread and butter was the highlight of my night, lol. . . Ordered a variety of dishes.... -steak and frites was so average. Are you kidding me? No au jus sauce for the steak?? I couldn't believe it. So I sat there eating a fairly dry steak, not fun. The entire point of steak and frites is so you can soak it up in all the juices!  . . I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for a fine dining experience in Las Vegas. Check out Michael Minna's restaurant in the Bellagio for better food.
My boyfriend surprised me with a trip to vegas for our anniversary! Wow, I think I'll keep him for a while longer. Well we stayed at the Venetian Hotel!!! and had our evening dinner there at Bouchon. . . It was wonderful. They had all these French menu items. My Beau said he was going to order me some snails but they didn't have any. Instead I had some of the best french fries I ever had and a really tasty steak. My beau had a really yummy chicken. We each had several glasses of wine and a fine evening!
Excellent, but pricy.  Chicken and waffles off the hook,  great gravy, vanilla butter, with chive bacon waffles and roasted chicken. Coffee was also top notch.
Last minute decision to come here for breakfast.  Great last minute decision!!  . Had the BLT tartine...that was sooo good!  Never thought of having basmic vinegar on egg, but now I must have that all the time now. . . Service was wonderful.  Highly recommend!
Well its French--circa 1960--tired, uninventive, cholesterol packed fare at dinner. Its true fat and salt can make anything taste good, but perhaps stick with spam. Emblematic of the experience was greeting the three employees at the host stand with, "Bon soir, comment vas tu?" and receive puzzled expressions and no response all around.
was, okay.. . I had the lamb entree, nothing exceptional.  could use more fresh veggie on the plate versus just legumes.. . lamb cooked well but was not memorable at all. (no rosemary or other good taste)--was SOO PLAIN as if i was eating british food.. . service:. . waitor was nice. one server came with our dishes and we had to move things on our table to make space.  we are used to services being experienced enough to prep our table or manage the dishes they are carrying.
Amazing place to eat. All of our food was amazing and service was great, except our waiter. He was a complete DICK. We were new to the type of food and he was very rude when we had questions. Defiantly a place to take a date !! Only reason I rate 4 stars is because of our waiter, hope you don't get him!!
Went for dinner.  Sat at the bar.  The server did not know what kinds of oysters they had.  She also did not know what was on the cheese plate.  The food was nothing exciting.  Was served one of the worst glasses of wine (Syrah).  It wasn't corked, just tasted awful.  And that was after I waited 20 minutes to get it.  There were a bunch of managers standing around too while our server was clearly weeded.  I should have made them aware and not run to Yelp but we just wanted to get out of there after spending a load of money on a bad experience.
