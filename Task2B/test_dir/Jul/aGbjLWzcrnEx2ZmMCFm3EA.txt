Yummmmmmmmmmm. We decided to come here on a recent trip to Vegas after reading the reviews. We waited about five minutes and decided to sit at the bar. Tons of beers and cocktails to choose from, bartenders weren't too helpful at first but I think they were busy. After a beer they warmed up and chatted with us and suggested the Euro burger. I wanted to also try the Farm burger because I love the fried egg addition to burgers. We ordered the Euro, Farm, and truffle fries. Yes, yes, YES! The euro was the best burger I've ever had! Farm was decent but nothing compared to the Euro. Goat cheese on a burger, I will always say yes. The truffle fries and truffle aioli was delicious as well. I want to go back!
Truffle fries? Nom nom nom. Any kind of fried anything? Yum! Just go for drinks and fried stuff.. . Fish and chips - so juicy and the breading tastes almost sweet. Onion rings - crispy and yum. . . We ended up ordering a lot of appetizers and a lot of sides, and everyone loved their food. Not many burgers were ordered, which is ironic because the name of the place IS BurGR. The waitstaff was super chill and fun. The wait to get in was maybe 10 minutes on Saturday night.
Best burger place hands down! From taste to texture everything was perfect! We came right when they opened at 11a and got a seat right away. Service was good. We got the Hells Kitchen burger, Euro burger, truffle fries and onion rings. It can be a bit pricey but when you're getting high quality food its 100% worth it. I wouldve paid double for this food. Yum! Yum! Yum!
First try and Gordans spot in planet hollywood. there was a line however we bypass the line somehow and get seated right away. Great customer service and food came out pretty quick. try the jalapeno poppers, and milkshakes!
Chocolate hazelnut pudding with coffee milkshake was absolutely delicious!. . Burgers were okay but I wouldn't pay avg. $15 per burger again for the taste. Too wide of grill marks made a burnt taste. I had a chanterelle burger and my wife had an American burger. We had regular fries wide cut which I'm not a fan of. The curry ketchup was delicious. Tasted like masala sauce.. . Milkshake came right away and was to die for but kitchen took about 45 minutes to get burgers out. Then another few min to get fries. How hard is it to grill a burger and deep fry fries?
After all the hype few friends and I decided to give it a try. I orderded the hell's kitchen burger my friend ordered another burger and the chicken burger. We also ordered some truffle fries. First it took so long to just get out fries. The burgers realoy didnt have much flavor, the chicken burger was just two pieces of fried chicken in a bun, really disappointing. We ordered chicken wings because it looked good on our neighbor's table, the chicken looked bloody when you get closer to the bone, I ask the server and she said its party of it. The server said maybe we went on a wrong day but I not too sure.
This is the second time I've eaten here and both times it was great. This time I ordered the Brit burger and my boyfriend had the Hell's Kitchen burger. We also split the jalapeno poppers.. . The poppers were very good--crispy and spicy. Actually a little too spicy; I had my soda refilled twice while eating. My only gripe was that I wish the waiter told us what the sauce was. It was already dipped it so we ended up cutting all of them in half so I could have ranch-less jalapeno poppers.. . Now the burgers were perfect. My Brit burger was cooked the way I wanted and the mango chutney was delicious. The bun was even better this time around. My boyfriend's Hell's Kitchen burger was great, too. Cooked to order, balanced, and the avocado tasted very fresh. The spiciness of the roasted jalapeno went very well with the cheese. He said he'd definitely order this again.
After about a four hours drive we werepretty hungry.  Walking in and saw a line and thought "okay great, how long is this going to take?"  Checked in with the hostess and she said about a 20 to 25 minutes wait, so I guess not too bad.  So you get in a line for party of two or less.  For larger party you sign in with the hostess.  . . honey pig bao bun (3/5) -- ordered this for the appetizer.  There's two bao in an order.  The bao (chinese steamed bun) is pretty much like the ones you get when you order the peking duck platter at a Chinese restaurant.  Nice and soft.  Sandwiched in the middle are roasted pork belly, cucumber,  radish, cilantro, and hoisin sauce.  The reason for only 3 stars is because the pork belly was bland.  There's not enough flavor.  And the meat is not fatty enough.  I think if the cha siu was more flavorful and juicy, this would have been mouth watering delicious.    . . farm burger (3.5/5) -- duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, and fried egg.   The beef patty was good.  Moist and juicy.  I ordered a medium and it was cooked just right.  Reason for not giving it a 4 or 5 stars is because I think the duck bacon was a little too salty for my taste.  The saltiness over power the flavor in the beef.  . . britannia burger (4/5) -- English sharp cheddar, mango chutney, and arugula. Tasty!  The beef patty was juicy and moist.  The mango chutney gives the burger a hint of sweetness.  The arugula provides a pungent peppery taste.  Overall, a well crafted burger.  . . Oreo shake (5/5) -- YUMMY YUM YUM!  Sooooo good!  Oreo milk shake with a layer of creme brulee and whipped cream.  To add to the deliciousness, you also get a whole oreo on top!  Shared it with my hunnie.  I got the side with the cream :)  The milk shake was creamy.   The creme brulee was so smooth and rich.  Delicious! . . Service was good.  Staffs are attentive.  I'll come here again just for the shake.. . *All pictures courtesy of hunnie
I was looking forward to the pork belly dog, but it was no longer in the menu. . Started with the tangerine screwdriver which was delicious.  I ordered the pork belly buns which were good, but not impressive. I also ordered the hummus which was really good, and would  definitely get it again.. . I came back cause I had to get a burger at a burger place. Got the Britannia burger which was  amazing. I also ordered the regular fries which were a little stale and too thick for my taste, and would have tasted better with regular ketchup.. . Overall I would come here again.
A-OK.  Three stars really isn't bad when you look at it that way, but it just looks bad compared to 4-5 stars.  . . But Burgr to me just isn't one of those PLACES.  It was good, but it's hard to justify a $15 burger no matter where I am.  That better have organic, grass-fed beef and all other organic ingredients and I don't think Burgr does because they'd probably advertise it if they did.. . It was a short wait, service was good, the food was good and the truffle fries were good.  The portion sizes are plentiful.  Honestly, two people could probably share a burger and fries, but I know some people like to get stuffed.  Bottom line: the food is good.  If you want to spend $15 for a burger, go for it.  I think you could get a similar tasting burger for less.. . Earl of Sandwich is somewhere I have to go when I go to Vegas.  Same with Fat Tuesday.  The trip wouldn't be complete without going to those places.  Burgr isn't like that for me.
As a burger-fanatic, I've been waiting and wanting to try this place for an eternity. Every time I go to Vegas, it was difficult to come here, b/c everyone would be too hungover, want go to a dayclub, or gamble. Fortunately, I was finally able to see what the hype was about. We were extremely excited and wanted to order everything off the menu. We ended up starting with the Fury Chicken Wings, ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Euro Burger as our main, and got a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries. . . Fury Chicken Wings: the wings were surprisingly tasty. The sauce was slightly sweet, yet tangy. It wasn't too vinegary like many buffalo sauces and other condiments restaurants usually drench on top of their wings. They were also clean and easy to eat b/c it was like a lollipop, with the bone as a handle. The blue cheese crumbles accompanying it was really sharp and pungent. It complements the wings well, but eating it alone was a bad idea (I usually don't like cheese, especially stinky cheese). . . Hell's Kitchen Burger: the first bite was pretty decent, but the subsequent bites deteriorated with taste. I thought that the buns were stale and dry. The patty was cooked to my liking (medium), but it seemed like something was missing.. . Euro Burger: I thought that this was better than the Hell's Kitchen Burger. It was slightly savory, but again, the buns didn't compliment the burger as a whole. I prefer my buns (burger buns) to be soft and slightly fluffy (like Hawaiian Rolls). . . Truffle Parmesan Fries: although they were only fries, I thought that this was my favorite item that we ordered. The fries tasted like they were freshly cut, texture was crisp, and it wasn't too greasy. One order is good enough to share between three people. . . Overall, the restaurant didn't live up to the hype. Unfortunately, I was disappointed after my meal. Although I did leave with a full stomach, I was hoping to have had an amazing burger. Compared to other burger joints I've been to, this place is just average. Due to all the hype, and it being a Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, it's a good place to try at least once. However, I wouldn't wait for more than 20 mins to eat here again.
not too impressed. everything was fine but nothing was awesome or notable.
Good beer and good burgers.. . What else do I need to say?. . But really though, my burger was tasty and cooked to a perfect MR.. . Service was great and attentive.. . The only negative things I have to say about it is that the line was hella long to get a table. Everyone sees the name, Gordon Ramsay, and they start getting starry eyed. . . The restaurant is cool and all, but I think it's a little gimmicky. Yeah, it has Chef's name on it, but he's not cooking your burger for you, calm down.
Our experience being seated was so bad that we couldn't even enjoy the food when we finally got seated.  I've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant.  After being told that it would be a 30-40 minute wait for a table we find a place at the edge of the bar to stand and have a drink.  An hour later we are still at the bar watching patron after patron who arrived after us be seated.  We were very polite and asked several times about our table and others being seated.  We were told that they had a rule to give preference to parties of 2, we had 3 in our group.  After being spoken to rudely and dismissed by the hostess we finally asked for the manager after approximately 90 minutes.  She was accommodating, but not particularly friendly.  We were even more infuriated when we were shown to our table only to see 5 surrounding tables completely empty.  I guess they were happy to see us buying drinks at the bar and so they continued to ignore us.  We were so excited to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, no so anymore.  NEVER AGAIN Gordon.
Delicious!  . But don't order too much food.  . . This may have been too much for me to eat:. - Euro Burger. - Shake with chocolate hazelnut pudding + coffee. - Honey-Pig Bao Bun (1 out of an order of 3). - part of an order of Truffle Parmesan Fries. . I'm gonna blame the shake for doing me in.  Also the bottom/end of the shake was all thick pudding, which was kinda not too appealing to me at the end, since the consistency at the top was more milkshake.
I've been a big fan of Gordon Ramsay for some time, so I was REALLY excited to be here. I was expecting to hear some yelling and feel a serious ambiance, but I got the opposite of that. :( haha jk.. . . Service: EXCELLENT. The hostesses were really nice and helpful. Everyone had a smile on their faces (even if they can't bend over due to their dresses being so short haha). Our server was an ecstatic man who was informative, helpful and (I have to add in) good looking. Anyways, best service I've ever gotten. He even warned us to not get too much since the burgers were pretty filling. One con was that the wait time for the food was pretty long, so prepare yourself. . . Food:. . Truffle Fries:. . I really don't like truffle oil and I confirmed it eating this, but the fries were still good. Unique, fancy and well made. The fries weren't too crispy or too soggy, the perfect balance. I'd recommend if you want to try something different.. . Brittania Burger (arugula, mango chutney, some kind of cheese and a bunch of awesomeness):. . Delicious. It wasn't overly greasy like a lot of burger joints. I've been to so many where you get grease dripping from the fingers, not a pretty experience haha. The bun was so soft and cute. And the bite was a party in my mouth. After eating half of it, I got pretty full, but I also had a toffee pudding shake before it (which was really rich). I really recommend this burger if you like a battle between sugar and salt :). . Shake #1 (toffee pudding and.... Other amazing things haha):. . Everything in it is homemade so it was pretty epic. I've got to add in that it is very rich. If you like shakes, I'd recommend it, but make sure you don't drink too much or you'll be too full to eat haha. . . Overall, if you're looking for a place to eat at check this place out!
Waited in line for ~30 minutes but it was worth it because the boyfriend and I are huge fans of Master Chef and Hell's Kitchen. The exterior already attracted us and the ambiance of the restaurant is definitely upscale. Immediately after we were seated down we noticed the extreme detailing of this place. Everything looked so pretty! Our server was also friendly (even though he took forever to bring our drinks). . . We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was pretty good. The flavors were well-balanced. As Gordon Ramsay would say, "the burger brings a lot of heat, it's got a nice kick to it!" However, we wanted medium-well but that wasn't what we really got. We also ordered the TruffleParmesan Fries and that was delicious. The sauces that we were given were unique-tasting, MUST TRY! . . Overall, Gordon Ramsay Burgr met the standards of what a burger should taste like, but nothing stood out or was spectacular. We would like to return again though to try their other burgers or the devil dawgs.
Our burgers and fries were good but definitely not worth the price. On top of that, service was terrible. Not only did our food take forever to arrive, our server, Ginger, was unprofessional and awfully inattentive. She never came to check up on our table. When she did finally show up with the bill, she made it seem like we were wasting her time.
The burgers are good but not worth the price. Buns are delicious. Meat isn't season well so the flavor mostly comes from the toppings. The farmhouse burger was okay, but I prefer real bacon :) the euro burger was really tasty, but again because of the goat cheese and aioli, it was tasty.. . Shake #5 was good. Summary: not worth wait or price. . . Notes:. Line is long. That's okay, it's on the strip and it's Gordon Ramsay. But. We got seated and then waited about 30 minutes. No food. And they have at least 15 burgers sitting under the heat lamp. The burgers obviously don't take long to cook. It's the service that takes long. We saw a hot dog sit under a heat lamp for 30 minutes before going out. If this was one of his shows, the person in charge of running the food would have gotten the boot.
My God I've died and gone to Burger Heaven! The burger at Burgr has got to be the best burger I've had in my life and I am a burger aficionado. It has officially overtaken Umami Burger's number one spot in my book.. . Go hungry because the burger is pretty filling. I love that they allow sharing though i didn't share. I went alone and order The European Burger, Truffle Fries, A cocktail. the Ruby Red one I forget the name and Shake #1.. . I ate the entire burger though i was full and nibbled on a few of the fries which was a shame as they were expensive. I wish they had half orders. But the portion size is great for sharing.. . That shake!!!! Can I just talk about that shake??? I had Shake number 1 which had pudding on top and a cookie crisp. Man they should serve that pudding separately as well. It's so rich and thick. You eat it with a spoon and then finally get to your shake. YUMMMMS!. . http://www.meonlybetterfitness.com
Long waits, average prices, delicious foods :) this past week was my second time here at burgr, and the wait this time (1hr 15mins) was even longer than my first time (45mins)! Planet Hollywood has like a million shops, so I had plenty to preoccupy myself whilst waiting. But well worth the wait, I got my favorite from last time, the euro burger and a side of truffle fries. Their truffle aioli, literally amazing. The fries to stand to be a bit crispier, but I'm just nit picky. All in all my experience was just as good as last time, the staff are all attractive people, and very nice as well. They got one of my table member's orders wrong, and corrected it without questioning or anything. Still highly recommend burgr, and cannot wait to come back! :)
I went to the restaurant after reading comments on yelp and I wasn't disappointed. Great service and great burgers at a reasonable price. The waitress did an awesome job guiding us through the menu and the beverage selection. The burgers were cooked as ordered and the selection itself was nice.. . Definitely a place to stop if you're looking for good honest food at a reasonable price.
One of the better quality burgers I have had. I probably would have rated it 5-stars if the cost and the wait were not a little steep. I can only complain so much though because it is a Gordon Ramsay establishment. If you are looking for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant to visit and not wanting to have to pay for a more expensive meal, then this is your place.
One of the better burgers I've had in a while. Ordered the Farm Burger just to try the duck bacon, and that along with the egg was amazing. Nothing like a juicy burger with bacon and a runny egg yolk! The truffle fries were great as well. Only gripe was after being seated the server took forever to come back, but I will definitely come back here my next time in Vegas.
Waiting was a bit tedious as times continuously extended 15 minutes after coming back the previous 15 minute estimated given time. After finally being seated and being in a grumpy mood from waiting with an empty stomach, our server James changed the whole ball game with his very welcoming introductions and suggested all the great food. My girlfriend and I could have sworn he was the manager of the place serving guests due to his pristine personality that changed our frowns from entrance to a great experience with a happy smile when leaving. Definitely an experience! AMAZING SAUCES!
Such a let down! The hells burger was good but not nearly as good as Holsteins. Pricey but onion rings were good and sweet potato fries....other than that meh...
After reading the reviews on Yelp I knew I had to try this place for myself. My friends and I ordered the following:. . 1. Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings [$9]. 2. Roasted Jalapeno Poppers [$12]. 3. "Just Fries" [$8]. 4. Chanterelle Burger [$16]. 5. Hell's Kitchen Burger [$14]. 6. Farm Burger [$15]. . If I had to choose one item from the list above I would choose the Roasted Jalapeno  Poppers! . . The food and service was great but if you go during a busy time you'll most likely end up waiting 30+ minutes before getting seated.
When you're in Vegas, you know you're gonna splurge a little. Why not splurge on a burGR?! I've always been afan of Gordon Ramsey's show, Kitchen Nightmare, but never got the chance to eat at any of his restaurants...'till now.. . High end burgers are going to cost you a pretty penny. Burgers here are at least $15, but they're worth it! Try the Euro burger: the goat cheese and arugula pair really well together. I loved the toasted brioche buns! It added a bit of sweetness to the burger that contrasted nicely with the savory patty. I also tried the Farm Burger. The fried egg was a nice touch to the burger. Everything tastes better with an egg in my opinion. And duck breast bacon? Say whaaaa!? This is also a must try!. . I only wish the fries were crispier. They seemed a bit soggy to me. The truffle fries were nothing special. Just Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Not worth the $10 spent, but now I know. I will probably just stick to their regular fries next time. I really liked the chipotle ketchup though. Why didn't I think of that sooner! I'm gonna start making it at home now. . . And an added bonus: waiters- helpful and RIPPED! They all looked good in their matching uniform. A gal can't help, but look. Haha.
So excited to finally be eating at a Ramsay restaurant. Wait wasn't bad at all to get in. Love the iPad with the drinks menu, but wish it had prices on the mixed drinks. Onions rings were ok but will pass on them next time. I agree with people saying they are salty but the ranch is amazing. Now on to the good stuff...burgers. I got the uber cheese and it was sooo good. Yes a little dry, BUT the goat cheese makes up for it. Husband got the Hell's Kitchen and he say spicy so be forewarned. Will come back again but to share a burger and get the bao puns as the guy next to me had them & they looked so good!
We waited 45min to grab and early dinner; we ordered, waited....3 of us got our food; hubby didn't; Manager came over and apologized about the order problem and his food should be out shortly; but it seemed like every waiter that walked by our table kept apologizing about the order mix-up and we felt all other table eyes were on us...food came along with an order of garlic fries.  When it came time to pay, hubby noticed his order wasn't on bill.  Nice.  If we wanted to be the center of attendtion then I would have given a 5 star rating, but other table waiter overload with apologies for a hamburger --- it wasn't stake.   I think it would have been more personal for just our waiter, the Manager and just our table to know what was going on with the order- Not the whole eating area.
Visited BurGR during a recent business trip to Las Vegas.  It was one of the meals that I was most looking forward to.  Unfortunately, it failed me...at least partially.  Dining by myself this meal, I bypassed the line of waiting people and asked the hostess if I could simply sit at the bar, where there was one empty seat remaining.  She said Yes and soon I was being served by a very nice bartender.  While I was perusing the menu, I ordered an Angry Orchard Cider (the Crisp variety was on tap) and it was delicious!  For my meal, I chose the Parmesan Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings, which came with chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip, and the Britannia Burger, described as being topped with English sharp cheddar, mango chutney, and arugula.  The restaurant was very busy, but even so the service was fairly prompt.  When my meal arrived, I first tried an onion ring and IT WAS AMAZING...by itself and with either of two dipping sauces!  Sadly, the burger was another thing entirely.  I took my first bite, expecting to receive a broad flavor of savory meat and cheese, spicy arugula, and sweet mango chutney.  Well, the savory and the spicy were there, but there was no sweetness whatsoever.  Confused, I put down the burger, removed the top, and found nothing that resembled chutney.  I called over the bartender, explained the situation, and she offered to either bring me a small dish of chutney or have them make me a new burger entirely, this time with the chutney included.  I chose the former, but what she brought me, in my opinion, could scarcely be called a "chutney".  When I think of a chutney, I think of a mixture of diced fruits and spices that retain some semblance of solidity.  What I got was thin, runny, and had maybe two very thin slices of something that may have been a fruit at some point.  I dipped a finger, tasted it, and it was sweet, so I poured it atop my hamburger patty.  Sadly, as I lifted the burger and took a bite, much of the thin liquid substance leaked out the sides, affecting the overall flavor of the burger very little.  The burger was still good, not great, but good, so I went ahead and finished it without further comment to the bartender.  Had it not been for the saving grace of those onion rings, this meal would have been a disaster, especially given the price of the burger.  So, my advice, get the onion rings and if you are considering the Britannia Burger, then make sure that they have improved the chutney before ordering.  That said, if you are craving a good burger on the Strip, then I highly recommend Fukuburger within Fame in the Linq; but better yet, if you can get off Strip, then go to Bachi Burger!
Waited 20 minutes to be seated. Ordered in 2 minutes, waited for said order for 20 minutes. The burgers and fries are very tasty! Ordered the Euro Burger ,  Blue Burger , Parmesan Fries and Shake #5 ( I call it the Nutella Shake).  No server came back  to check on us. The shake never arrived.  Our waiter got sick and went home. We cancelled our shake order, eventually got our check, paid it and left. Never to return again!!!
see... here's the thing.. . I came here strictly because of being a Gordon Ramsay fanboi.  There's no way I would wait in line for an hour to get a burger.. . After an hour and 15 minutes of waiting we were finally seated after being quoted an hour.  We ordered the Farm burger, the Chili Cheese dog, and the parm truffle fries. The burger was good. The bun was very good.  The duck bacon is different for sure as we were warned by the server.  The chili cheese dog was disappointing but the fries were delicious.  Ask for the white cheddar ranch sauce to accompany the fries and you wont be disappointed.  . . All in all I wont dine here again if the wait is over 20 minutes, but the burger was delicious.
Holy mother of fucking earth!  One of the best burgers I've ever had. I can't get over how delicious the burgers are here and the pork belly sliders are ridiculously out of this world.  My review does no justice for this place you must come check it out for yourself.  Staff  is very friendly and attentive, nice decor, and the service is fast.  I will be coming back that's for sure..
I was so underwhelmed when I was here. . . Service was good food came fast. I don't quite like the iPad on the table but ehhh. . . Truffle fries were quite blah and didn't eat but a few. The burger was also very ehhh, I had about three bites and ate the rest when I was drunk. . . In my opinion there are much better places to eat while in Vegas.
Very very delicious burger, almost a 5 star but I'll tell you why in this review. So the place is located inside Planet Hollywood near the front entrance. The inside was very chill, cool, and greeted with nice customer service. As I sat down the waiter have me an iPad to look over the beverages & deserts which is cool that you get to see a clear view of what you want to drink and eat.. So ordered the popular European burger which had various types of cheese which was very similar to blue cheese but I forgot the type of cheese it had. I had the meat cooked media cause I wanted that juicey taste. Every bight of the burger was great but the only thing I didn't like was that it put too much of the creamy cheese. Other than that the burger was delicious. . The highlight of the dinner was the awesome epic parmesan garlic fries. These fries is a must to have and their white dipping sauce was epic. So good that even my gf that's not a fries fan, she loved it soo much.
Prices are crazy good for Vegas food. This is a freaking  Ramsey restaurant at really affordable prices. The quality of the food is outstanding. By far the best burgers in Vegas . A must try.. . Service was very attentive and the dogs are huge
When in Vegas, splurge a bit because... Vegas.  My friends really wanted to try this place out, so here we go.. . The prices for the burgers aren't too bad, somewhere between 12-16 bucks like any other high end burger joints.  The burgers here are pretty bomb.  I got the Chanterelle Burger.  I liked it a lot and the meat was cooked just right for medium rare.  The Truffle Fries were great and the Creme Brulee Oreo Milkshake wasn't all that bad.  The shake might have been a bit too sweet for me though (personal preferences).  . . And you could totally try different burgers by cutting and exchanging your burger with friends.  Trying different burgers for the price of one. Yay. . . Anyway, great quality of food and wonderful costumer service.
45 minute wait.  Worth it? Absolutely not.  The food took long to come out.  I started off with the pork belly bun.  The pork belly had nice flavor to it, thus the 2 star.  Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.  Pork belly was good, but the ratio of meat to veggie and bun was absurd.  Tried the farm burger along with all 3 different fries.  I thought the patty was a little flavorless and the overall taste did not meet my expectations of going to a world renown chef.  Looks like that place needs hells kitchen!
Admittedly, this place is a bit pricey for the food that you get. However, I am always satisfied with the quality of burger, the beautiful display of the food, and I can never get enough of the fries. The location (right inside Planet Hollywood) is spectacular. If you're willing to spend a few extra bucks for a great burger, then I'd definitely recommend BurGR. . . If you like eggs (particularly ones with runny yolk), especially if you've never gotten an egg with your burger... You MUST get the farm burger, hands down. I've gotten this all 3 times I've been here, and it's never disappointed. The meat is juicy, tender, and flavorful. As for fries, I prefer the truffle fries -- the truffle sauce is simply spectacular. My mouth is watering even as I think about it. If you can, just slather as much sauce as you can and then ask for more. I've asked for seconds (and thirds) of the sauce before.. . NOTE: If you're aiming to get in at a reasonable time, particularly on busy Vegas weekends, I would start waiting in line even before it opens... Otherwise, it's not quite worth the wait. Last time I was there, we arrived around 30 minutes after opening and had to wait about an hour to be seated.
With my friends I was able to try these items from the menu:. . Blue Burger - This burger was designed for an acquired taste.  If you enjoy the bitter taste of arugula that unlocks the palate for the rest of the burger, then you will enjoy the simple and rustic combination of the cheese and arugula that leaves a bitter but savory taste in your mouth.  Not my cup of tea but my friend loved it.. . Britannia Burger - The arugula is masked by the hidden jewel in this burger. The amazing Mango chutney.  Combining the best of sweet and savory, the Britannia is a great choice for someone who is looking to satisfy their stomachs as well as their sweet tooth.. . Farm Burger - A burger fit for the protein induced.  The duck breast bacon unfortunately becomes overpowered by the runny egg sandwiched between the two buns.  You need a sensitive palate to differentiate this "fancy" burger from one you can make yourself at home.. . Earth Burger - This was ordered for the vegetarian at our table.  A huge portobello mushroom replaces the patty and the mix of tomato, fontina cheese and arugula creates a salad of flavors in your mouth.  . . Fish & Crisp Sandwich - I ordered the fish sandwich, thinking that since Gordon's from the UK, his restaurant must make a damn good fish and chips.  The sandwich was massive and spectacular.  The fish was crisped to a level of buttery perfection.  However, much of the success of this sandwich goes to butter rather than the fish itself.. . Shake #4 - It's an Oreo shake, meh.. . Truffle Parmesan Fries - This. This was one of the two reasons why BurGR gets five stars from me.  While the burgers themselves were very high quality, the truffle parm sauce was a unique flavor I had never tasted before.  The truffle flavor was overpowering, to the point where it stunk for my nose with every bite I inhaled, but I couldn't stop eating them.  The sauce itself was imbued with the very essence of truffles, a quality that one could taste with every bite!. . Sweet Potato Fries - These were also very meh for me.. . Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings - The second winner of the table, our server insisted that the onions were shipped to the restaurant from Hawaii, fresh daily.  Regardless, these were some damn good onion rings.. . I can understand the high price comes with the Gordon Ramsay brand name, but the meal was well worth it.  In terms of Vegas priced food, BurGR is a damn fine place to eat when you're living it up on the Strip, for all the right reasons.
Wanted to try my first Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  The service was excellent, but the food was just good, not mind blowing.  But I will say presentation on everything was excellent.. . We ordered:. Fury chicken wings - came out very fast, tasted pretty good.. Farm burger - didn't really taste the wood fire grilled patty.  The egg was perfectly fried, and I mean perfectly.. Kale Granny-Apple Caesar Salad - this is the only item that we tried that I would order again.  It was that good.. chocolate hazelnut pudding + coffee shake+ praline cookie - was good, not bad. . Most of the items were good, not bad, not great.  Presentation was excellent, service was excellent.  I don't come to Vegas often so I probably won't come back (I want to try some of the other restaurants) but I would be happy to come back for that awesome salad and excellent service one day.
I expected much more from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant being that he is so highly critical of others and their methods. I like all of his shows and even started cooking at home after watching an entire season of Kitchen Nightmares on Netflix. That might have nothing to do with his restaurant, but when your main source of marketing is being a celebrity chef that verbally bashes bad food made by other establishments, you have to expect a certain level of service & quality in his product. . . If it wasn't for the awesome glass wall of fire in the front of this restaurant, I'd give it 1 star. . .  I wen't to Vegas for memorial day week and 3 of my 6 reservations were at his restaurants (Burger @PH, Steak @Paris, & Pub@Ceasers).  Burger was the 1st of his spots on my trip. Even with a reservation we waited 15 minutes in line, which was the same wait time for those without a reservation. The promptness of service was good, but there was a breakdown in service at some point because the 4 of us weren't that pleased with the food.. . 1. My medium bacon burger was very well-done & bacon was somewhat bland.. 2. My friends well-done burger arrived bloody, but he liked the fries.. 3. The female of the group ordered a meatless mushroom burger w/ no complaints.. 4. My other friend received the burger as ordered, but he said it wasn't that great. . . After spending $140 for mediocre burgers, the group agreed not to waste our time with the other 2 Ramsey restaurants & I cancelled the open table reservations.. . There are thousands of burger places to choose from  in Vegas, step it up!
We come here each time we come to Vegas, this time we hit it up twice. First time this trip, service great, food superb, & wait wasn't that bad.. . 2nd time, we came around 6pm w/2 more in our party and we had to wait an hour. We gambled while we waited, no biggie.. . Greeting was great, our Waitress was great, the SA was not. She came around quickly throwing drinks on the table(literally) then rushing off without an apology for spilling our drinks. . . We dried up the liquid & watched this girl move around the restaurant. She never smiled, seem not to want to be there. Later, after we got our meal, she popped by & this time slammed a refill glass on table & quickly left. . . To the good stuff- I ordered fuzzy wings, they ordered American Burgers & Hells Kitchen Burger. We ordered the mid rare, which was perfect. . . . Quick tip- when ordering fries, just order 1 for 2 people. You'll get full easily. . . I would have given 5 stars but I could not excuse the SA.
Three words: Southern. Yardbird. Burger.. . If you go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR (and you will), this item has to be one you consider trying. Now, I know the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the American Burger are popular items; but listen to me: you see that photo I posted of that Southern Yardbird Burger? That could be YOU.. . With that out of the way, Gordon Ramsay BurGR was enjoyable overall. My crew knew that there was going to be a wait in order to seated; we got to the restaurant around 5 on a Friday. Once we got the text message that seating was available, it was on. I can't remember exactly who our waiter was, but he was on point the entire time; made sure drinks were filled, provided great recommendations, and provided that Las Vegas hospitality to some folks coming from the East Coast.. . I can definitely see why this place stays packed: good food + good drinks + good service + friendly atmosphere = satisfied and returning customers. I will be back here once I come back to LV.. . Oh yeah, before I forget: Southern. Yardbird. Burger.
I finally had the pleasure of dining at a Gordon Ramsay establishment! I've spent years watching him scream at poor contestants on Hell's Kitchen while inspiring home cooks on Master Chef and last but not least helping failing restaurants come out of the ashes on Kitchen Nightmares. . . Quick Tip: party greater than 3 or more skip the line and speak with the hostess. They will put you down and send you a text when your table is ready. Sorry, if you are a table of two you have to wait in line. . I opted to try the Hog Burger since its one of their signature dishes. I was pleasantly surprised at how moist and tender the pork was bite after bite. It was cooked to medium perfection (recommended) and seasoned just enough to not steal the lime light from the porky goodness.. . Fries were decent but nothing to write home about. We also got an order of wings for the table to share. Wings were fall off the bone and flavorful but for the price and size it felt a little steep. . . Overall Thoughts. . Gordon Ramsay, 1 for 1!
Keep your personal stuff PERSONAL is all I have to say. I don't know if tonight was an off night for the staff, but our server Lauren was horrible. After waiting 15 minutes for a drink menu, she was nowhere to be seen.. FINALLY she comes back, and we got some sob story about how someone's mother died and this is why she took so long to take our order!!! WTF!! My husbands mother passed a few years back and it was NOT good timing on behalf of our server!!! We took this trip in hopes to alleviate some of our stress at home! I am a highly compassionate person, but I do not want to ever hear a story like this when I'm literally just wanting to have a nice dinner , and relax. Hearing this added a level of stress to the meal and dining experience. I watched Lauren take another 15 minutes to enter one tables order, while racing around apologizing to everyone, then neglecting another table for another 15 minutes and they looked raging mad by the time she took their order. I do NOT appreciate being made to feel GUILTY because I'm a guest at a restaurant.
Enjoyed this place a lot however the wait times are a bit ridiculous at an hour plus. I ordered the hog burger and between the other 5 people we were with we tried a lot of what Burger had to offer. Overall I was impressed but not blown away.
I rarely ever write a review on YELP, but in this case I just had to. First on a positive note, the food was delicious. We had the Blue Burger, onion rings, and truffle fries. Now what made it even better was the exceptional service we received from David. He took time from his very busy hour and educated us on the restaurant,  Gordon Ramsey, the menu and then surprisingly pointed out that Christina Wilson, winner of Hell's Kitchen, was the executive chef!! We had our 12 year old daughter with us who was also in awe. I made it a point to walk up to say hello and THANK HER! She was busy texting or something on her phone, barely looked up and said "Youre welcome" Wait! What? You're welcome?? Wow!!! Rude! Does she think she's to good to take 30 seconds to acknowledge a customer? What if I had been a food critic or a celebrity?  Shame on you Christina!!
Being a fan of Gordon Ramsay I was very excited to finally have the chance to try one of his restaurants. I was excited to see if everything you see on TV matched the quality in one of his own restaurants. I can say with full confidence, Ramsay didn't let me down! . . The first thing you will need to know, which you would expect, is there will be a bit of a wait to get into Burgr - burgers and Gordon Ramsay, that creates a line! The staff is super nice and incredibly trained and they take your cell phone number so they can text you as your table is about ready, so you are able to roam the casino floor or whatever it is you'd like to do.. . Burgr is abeautifully decored restaurant and yet it doesn't get caught up in the hype of trying to be overly fancy or intimidating considering who's name is in the title. Everything is clean, modern and as it should be. The back is opened to the casino floor so it has great flow and is awesome for checking out the scene as well as people watching.. . The menu is loaded with items that you can't wait to try while being very reasonably priced for being the home of a celebrity chef on the Vegas Strip. It keeps it's customers in mind and is loaded with down to earth American style selections that don't try to impress you with their unknown or hard to pronounce ingredients. We averaged (with drinks and dessert) $25 a person.. . Even though I say it's down to earth American, that's not to say there isn't flare in the burger selections/toppings, because there definitely are. I had the Britannia Burger - English cheddar, mango chutney and arugula (cooked medium) and I'm here to declare it was the best burger I've ever had. You could taste the quality in every single ingredient component and it was cooked absolutely perfectly.. . Another thing that I was happy about was that we had our young daughters with us (ages 5 and 8) and they were able to easily find items they wanted off the menu and then devoured them! I know as parents we worry about spending extra money just to see the kids say yuck! Not the case here. One daughter got the apple wood grilled hot dog (which is insanely impressive when delivered to your table) and said it was the best thing she's ever had!. . Also, the homemade Parmesan fries along with homemade ketchup were enough to keep me happy, to be honest!!! They were so good! Along with the gourmet oreo shake with creme brulee topping, we were over the moon with choosing Burgr out of the array of restaurants on the strip. If you are a burger fan, it is a must that you eat here as soon as you can!
I instantly fell in love with BURGR.  When we got there it seemed like the line would be long but we got through it fairly quickly, about 15 minutes. When we sat down, the waiter was quick. He knew his stuff. When I asked for recommendations, he was very knowledgeable about how to make my burger taste even better. . . Now for the burger: I ordered the Euro burger ($16) which has goat cheese (which I tend to not like but went along with what the waiter recommended) and arugula, oven roasted tomato and truffle aioli. HOLY COW it was good. When it first comes to you, it doesn't look like a huge burger, but trust me, it is filling and just very satisfying. It was perfectly cooked to medium and the taste worked very well together.. . My boyfriend ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger ($14) and he couldn't get enough. He;s so picky too but really like how the flavors were on point. . . We shared an order of just fries ($8) and they were kind of like steak fries and one order was plenty for the two of us. Te flavored ketchup (chipotle ketchup and curried ketchup) were good too. I'm not much or a ketchup person, but I was enjoying it. . Yes, the price for this plus a beer for my boyfriend was about $ 45 before tip, but it was completely worth it. We left full and happy with our meals.. . We plan on going back before we leave town because it was THAT good.
Since my first visit a year ago, I've been dreaming about my return to BurGR. I'm happy to say the burger was absolutely amazing and just as good as I remembered. . . Here's what you need to know: . . Line: there will be a wait. Get over it. Is amazing. Put your name on the list and hang around in Planet Hollywood. They'll text you when your seat is ready. . . Food: get a burger. Any burger will do, but the Hell's Kitchen burger and the farm burger are amazing. The farm has duck bacon and a perfectly cooked egg. . . Service: it can be slow, but it's usually because they are so busy. They keep the drinks full, but just like any other Vegas restaurant they don't like to split checks. . . Just as with any other Harrahs property, show your total rewards card to save a bit of money. . . Go. Eat a burger. Enjoy the deliciousness.
I'm completely speechless.  Wow.  Worth every morsel/crumb of a calorie.  I got the American Classic burger with sharp cheddar, cooked medium.  It was heaven on a plate--complete perfection.  Yes, it's worth the wait, the calories, the money.  My group said the onion rings were the best in the history of onion rings!! Lol we had a moment of silence in their honor!! Already counting the minutes until my next fix!!!
Garlic Parmesean Truffle Oil Fries are AWESOME.  The aoli sauce was great but Gordon, you have to rethink putting the housemade ketchup on with those.  I am surprised!  It over powers the taste of the fries and is not complimentary at all.. . Southern Acacia cocktail EXCELLENT!  Light and refreshing!. . Hell's Kitchen Burger--Amazing! To die for!. . Service was excellent.  Everyone had great knowledge of the menu, it preparation.  The IPAD experience is an awesome touch.  Shows you the cocktails, what is in them, their 30 beers on tap and wine plus other goodies like GR Gifts.  . . Now the bad--the fish was excellent but was served on a crispy bun which was doughy.  The vinegar and salt chips.......not chips I am used to but okay.  The bun was absolutely a fuck up!  Get on it Chef!  . . Overall Congratulations on a great success!
A year ago, it was my friend's 22nd birthday, so we all went to Gordon Ramsay Burger because the birthday boy's girlfriend said that it was a must before we go back home! We waited for 5 mins and got seated, not bad for a party of 7.  The waitress was super friendly explaining and recommending stuff on the menu to us, since it was everybody's first time at Gordon Ramsay. I got the farm burger + fried egg with sweet potato fries. My sister got the same except thing but instead she got the truffle fries and  a strawberry shake. I forgot what my friend ordered, put I guess it's must be something good!. . After done eating my meal, the burger was on point and it was delicious. The service was excellent! But dont get me wrong, I just dont get the hype of this place? So, Gordon Ramsay is on a show "Kitchen Nightmares"...and so? IDK...after flying back home to San Francisco, every one of my friend's was screaming and dying to know how my experience was at Gordon Ramsay. To tell you the truth, it just taste like a normal burger with a fried egg in it. I gave it a 5 star because the service was fast and friendly. Also the burger is on point! But can somebody please explain this hype to me because I just don't get it. Even until today.
Quick tip: To get seated quickly, get together with friends to form a party of 3 or more. . . We ordered a Euro burger, Farm Burger, Chanterelle Burger, truffle fries and onion rings. . . Burgers are really good, except very salty! The Euro burger had just the right amount of goat cheese. . Onion rings and fries are very good, not oily and crisp! Dips were great! . Shake #1 and #5 was super thick and sweet. . . Wait staff was very attentive and friendly. Our waiter said he really enjoyed working there, especially with the new head chef. And it showed!
Now I've eaten at all three Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Vegas.  I put BurGR at the bottom of that list with Gordon Ramsay Steak inside Paris as one of the best restaurants in Vegas period.. . I've had better burgers at other places so I'm not completely wow'd by Gordon Ramsay BurGR.  The line to get a table was an hour wait...not worth waiting for in my opinion.. . However, if there's free seating at the bar - take it, and grab a bite.  One of our bartenders was Senia.  She was cute, perky and easy to talk to.  She definitely made the beer and burger taste better so kudos to GR for hiring some great help otherwise BurGR would get just 3 stars.. . I got the Hell's Kitchen burger which was good but a little dry.  My wife's Farm burger was much better.  The egg moistens the burger and gives it that extra something special.  Make sure to get the truffle fries...which were awesome.. . The restaurant sits at the front entrance to Planet Hollywood...easy to find.  The flaming signage is one of the best signs for anything I've ever seen.  Very cool.
I rarely eat burgers so I figured if I'm going to splurge I'll head to Gordom Ramsey's BurGR! I ordered the blue burger and sweet potato fries! Way too much for me to finish, but so freaking delicious! I thought everything was awesome, including the service! Can't wait to go back to Vegas and try his other restaurants!
As a disclaimer, I want to say that I love watching Gordon Ramsay's shows, such as masterchef and Hell's Kitchen. I have always wanted to eat at one of his restaurants just to try his food. That said, I think if it was bad food, my husband would've thought so too as he is not much of a Gordon Ramsay fan... . We both loved it, I got the farmer burger and he got the Hell's Kitchen burger. I have never had a better burger in my life, and we go out to eat a lot at nice restaurants. The fries were thicker, which wasn't bad as they were still crispy..I can't stand soft fries. The ketchup was great (two varieties, curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup) and my favorite part was the dessert, which was sticky toffee pudding in a push pop form, kinda weird, but it was still delicious. The line went relatively quickly as well even though it was a long line to begin with. We waited less than 30 mins and there were at least 30 people in front of us. The two person table was quite small though but everything else was great: food, wait time, hostess, server, atmosphere..I'd give it 5 starts across the board. Great restaurant that lives up to the Gordon Ramsay name. The two of us spent about $70 which is moderately priced for a vegas restaurant, and so worth it in my opinion.
Pros: Wait went faster than expected. Instead of the 20-30 minutes the host had said it only took about 15 min. . . The jalapeno poppers were OKAY. But you have to have a high tolerance for spicy because they are VERY HOT!!! . . Service was good. Out waiter was attentive. . . Cons: I had ordered the American burger and my friend ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. Both had NO flavor. We both ordered our burgers medium but they came out medium rare, my bottom bun was soggy with blood by the time it got to me. We also ordered the truffle fries, which we couldn't even really taste the truffle oil, and they were soggy. . . WE WERE BOTH EXTREMELY SICK AFTER DINNER THAT NIGHT. I will not go into detail, but we are still suffering even the next day. . . Overall: we spent $74 on 2 drinks, 2 burgers, 1 appetizer, and fries. We could have gone to In n Out and spent $10 on a better meal. Don't waste your time and money!
There is a line for those with only two people in their party. For parties of 3 or more, you have to add your name to the list. The normal wait is roughly 60-90 minutes. . . Service is great. Absolutely no complaints at all.. . Food:. Honey pig bao buns: 3 stars. Very little meat and just A-OK. Nothing special.. Hog burger: 4 stars. Truffle parmesan fries: 4 stars. Comes with 2 different sauces.. Onion rings: 5 stars. Very good especially when dipped into the sauces.. Oreo shake: Definite 5 stars. Highly suggest getting this! It has a layer of creme brulee on top!. . Overall I would say more of a 3 1/2 star experience.. . Tip: . The waitresses wear skirts that are wayyyyy too short so ladies beware of your mens wandering eyes. This is a warning not to be taken lightly :)
I have a borderline obsession with Gordon Ramsey. Since I don't get cable, it's not with his Kitchen Nightmares or Hell's Kitchens or what have you - no, it's his ridiculous talent.. . PEOPLE. GORDON RAMSEY IS MORE THAN JUST A YELLING BRITISH MAN IN A KITCHEN.. . He. Is. A. GODCHEF.. . There's this series called Ramsey's Ultimate Cookery Course; 100 recipes to stake your life on. And I would. Stake my life on it.. . So when Ryan suggested we go to get burgers, I said, "Meh...burgers..". . "Gordon Ramsey's restaurant.". . BURGERS!. . Worth the wait. Worth the price. Get the oreo shake with the creme brulee pudding and don't you fucking waste any of it.. . Their whiskey cherry cocktail is too sweet for my taste and gave me a wicked headache.. . The caesar salad was kale and romaine and despite being one of the most typically boring entrees, it was actually quite wonderful, mellow. The fries were great, too, and Ryan really enjoyed his burger (sans bun, because he likes to pretend he eats semi healthy).. . Goddammit Gordon Ramsey, you did it again. Of course you did, like I would have doubted you for a moment.
This was my second time visiting and loved it get again! I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was cooked perfectly. The jalapeno poppers are amazing! They are spicy but well worth it. We placed our name down and didn't get seated for and hour and a half. Expect at least this long of a wait. Once seated though, service was quick and attentive. The burgers are good, but definitely over priced simply for the hype. I've had a burger just as good other places back in Orange County. You definitely pay for the nice environment.
This is my second Gordon Ramsay establishment I've visited. The first was The London in West Hollywood, which was an amazing experience. . . I got the chanterelle burger and we split truffle fries. The burger was delicious but nothing special. The mushrooms were a bit too subtle and the figgy-onion jam was a bit too sweet. The whole thing was surprisingly very forgettable.. . The fries on the other hand were spectacular. Thick cut, perfectly salted, and generously covered in Parmesan cheese. It came with two different dips. One was a truffle aioli. I don't even remember what the second one was, but the truffle aioli was like crack. My brother and I fought over the fries like vultures and they were nearly all gone before we even touched the burgers. We then took the remaining truffle dip and spread it over our burgers as well. Seriously amazing. Next time if I'm ever in Vegas I'd probably just order multiple orders of fries and eat them until I feel sick.. . Oh yeah, the figgy pudding push ups were great as well!
Honestly, I wasn't mind blown by the food but it was a good experience. I was really glad they use a texting service to inform you once your table is ready for your group. (The line outside the place is only for tables for 2.) My friends and I were able to explore the mall within Planet Hollywood for about 45 minutes while we waited to receive a text back.. . I ordered the Chanterelle Burger and felt like I couldn't taste much of the other flavors aside from the meat patty. But the burger comes with a pretty large patty, so I felt like I got my money's worth as it filled me up like crazy! I had a bite of my sister's Farm Burger and enjoyed hers a bit more since I love eggs.. . The Truffle Parmesan Fries seemed okay to me. Most flavor came from the sauces served with the fries, which were good. But I didn't think the fries were anything spectacular.. . Perhaps I had higher expectations because of all the other reviews. I really wanted to love it but I just was not blown away. At least I can say I tried it! It was an overall good experience though. Just not sure if I want to pay $15 for a burger again.
I'd give it a 3.5, but I can't, so I went down to 3.. I'd heard all kinds of good things about this place, so the wife and I decided to have dinner here.. We had to wait in line to get in (there was no separet line for parties of 2 or less). When we got in, I saw empty tables. Hmm.... So, the place was very loud, and the chairs are really low, causing the waiter to bend over and talk very loudly. If my back was acting up, I would not like those seats.. My wife got a burger, and I got the pork burger. She liked hers, and mine was good, but I could barely even tell it was pork. In any case, both burgers were good.. No sides come with the burgers. What's up with that?. We had onion rings for an appetizer, and they were quite good, but a bit greasy.. We ordered one side of fries to go with our burgers, and didn't finish them. Not very good.. Drinks were pretty good. Service was pretty good, but not what you would expect from seeing Rameys's shows.. People at the next table over were French, and had trouble ordering. Funny that BurGR has photos of all the desserts and drinks, but not of the entrees.. The wife at that table got her burger long before her husband did, but the GM came by and said he was comping the man's burger. Not that he understood that.... So, overall, the burgers are good, the rings are good but greasy, the fries are bad, and the place is overpriced and overrated. 2 burgers, 2 sides, 4 cocktails =over $100.
Just for their 'milkshake', which can be a bit confusing if you don't read the fine print lol but in a good way: it's all deleesh pudding.  Being an excited tourist, all I saw was the heading Shakes on the menu, but alas, I did ask the server which was the most popular, so had some tough, tough choices to make:. . Orea, Caramel or the Coffee...so coffee it was, and can definitely say I'd be going back...so rich and so good yet smooth too.
If you are a party of two, don't go there!. . They make a party of two wait in the line.  . While we were waiting in the line, hostess removed larger parties who came after us  (7, 6, 14) and all of them got seated before us.  We waited 45 minutes.  A party of 6 came after 20 minutes or so but got seated 10 minutes before us.  Does this make sense to you?  . . Burgers were good but not worth the wait.
Don't forget to show them your "Total Rewards" to receive $1 off EACH item you order! If you don't have a player's card, you can get them for free in the casino. . . Came here with high hopes since it was a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.... I was surprise to see how small and open the restaurant was. The service, branding, and ambiance was pretty nice and flashy, but the food was a bit too salty. . . There's a separate line for people with parties of two or less. Parties with three or more can go straight to the hostess and add their name to the waiting list. They take down your number and text you when your table is ready. Apparently, you only have 10 minutes to get to the restaurant before they give away your table. . . . Our waiter was very nice and knowledgable. There's a ton of fancy ingredients with a variety of cheeses and truffle oil.  The hog burger is apparently their signature burger and the pork is recommended to be cooked at medium temperature. The waiter explained that the burger was like the kobe beef of pork. Minus the quality of the meat, and how it was prepared, my friends thought the burger did not have any other special 'kick' to it. Their Earth Burger was surprisingly good though it did not sound that interesting since the patties were portobello mushrooms. It was quite filling and delicious.. . The fries, onion rings, and parmesan cheese fries were okay. Again, not spectacular, but it hit the spot.. . But what made this place so special? Their delicious fatty milkshakes! I got their #2 milk shake, which was coconut pudding strawberry milkshake. It was quite delicious though it was EXTREMELY sweet. I've also noticed the milkshake also did not taste like a typical milkshake. The shake wasn't cold, nor did it have that chunky ice cream taste. . . I also got the privilege to try my friend's Creme Brulee pudding Oreo milkshake. That was a lot tastier than mine, and I would probably recommend that over the Strawberry milkshake. . . This place closes late, so I would recommend coming here after a few drinks or during off hours.
The food is just so good.  We had the Farm Burger (which I highly recommend ) and the Hog Burger. The truffle fries comes. With yummy dips and the you have to get the jalapeno peppers. I noticed there's no salt and pepper in the table.....hmmm...your food is perfection Gordan Ramsay?
My first visit about two weeks after the opening was amazing.  My second visit, not so much.  . . This restaurant has become very popular, and there is often a long line of people waiting to be seated.  We arrived at off-peak time on a Sunday afternoon, so the wait was only about 5 to 10 minutes.  The restaurant was nevertheless packed inside and on the loud side.  I could be mistaken, but there seemed to be more tables in the dining area than before. In any event, if you are not seated in a booth, you will be pretty close to the adjacent tables.  . . The service during my first visit rivaled fine dining.  This time, the service was slow, infrequent, and unpolished.  It took too long for our server to make her appearance after we were seated.  She was soft spoken, so it was hard to hear her over the din of the crowded restaurant.  When I asked her what beers they have on tap, she appeared to me to be annoyed by my question and placed an iPad in front of me to peruse.  She took our order very mater of factly and was on her way.  . . It must have taken 15 minutes for my beer to arrive, and that was about 10 minutes after my buddy's diet coke was delivered by a staffer who informed us the beer he didn't bring would be coming "soon."   Some other guy eventually brought the beer.  . . It took a good while longer for the food to come out.  I ordered my burger medium, but the burger I was served was well done.  I ate it without saying anything to avoid further annoyance to our server and because lord knows how long it would have taken to get a replacement.  . . We were staying at the Encore, so having lunch here wasn't exactly convenient.  Based on my first experience, the place seemed worth going out of my way for.  Based on my second visit, I might give it another chance, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do it.
This place is over rated. And too pricey. I got the veggie burger and expected it to be good (for 16$, yeah it better be) and found myself eating it only because I was paying so much for it. Literally one of the worst things I ever had.. . My boyfriend liked his, the server was good to add stuff to it and very nice. . . The fries were the best part (not worth 11$) but they were awesome. . . I wouldn't pay to eat here again, but if someone offered to pay for me I'd just get fries.
Great place- cool atmosphere and delicious food. We got here on a Tuesday at 1145am and waited about 10 minutes to be seated although bar seats were available if we wanted.. . The appetizers were amazing! The onion rings were the best I've ever had. The chipotle and curry ketchup were super flavorful! We ordered a shake #1 to go and wow-sugar explosion but amazing! My bf ordered the britianna burger medium and loved it. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger substituted meat for portobello patty . Honestly I would love if they actually had a veggie patty instead. It was really good and I love that you can substitute any of the burgers for meat free but a regular veggie patty would be much easier to eat. They put double portobello on there which was actually too much and made the burger fall apart and hard to eat. It was still really good I'm not complaining about that .. . Worth trying for sure!
I was shocked at the mediocrity of the burGRs - its almost as if Gordon Ramsey needs to film an episode of Hell's Kitchen at his own restaurant. Particularly bad was the chantrelle burger.
Error
In town to pick up family from McCarran, decided to give BurGR a try. Line was long, but flying solo, so the bar was first come seating, sweet.  Great tap beer selections, ordered the Blue, with bacon and just fries. Burger was cooked to perfection, juicy and delicious.  Fries come in this trophy like holder, but none remain as well.  The gal sitting next to me noticed contrasting uniforms, gals dressed like something off Star Trek and dudes like ranch hands. Thanks Chef Ramsay.
I don't think it matters which time of day you come, since there always seems to be a wait. We went in as a group of 5 for lunch. Don't get into the long line that you see outside. That is only for parties of 2. For anything larger than that, have your name put down up front. We were informed that the wait would be about 45 minutes long. They were quite accurate with their quoted time! We wandered around the mall during that time since they said they would text us right before our table was ready.. . The decor was great and service was attentive enough, though it does take awhile for the food to arrive. I ordered the Farm Burger, and we also ordered their Parmesan Truffle Fries to share. They were both unique, but didn't wow me. I'm glad I tried this place out, but I don't think I'd come back to pay $15 for a burger. However, 4 stars since it was still delicious and portions were huge. My friends and I were ready to pass out from food coma after lunch.. . They have their satisfaction survey on an iPod touch. I thought that was a unique way to catch people's attentions when they are paying the bill. Also, if you're a Total Rewards member, there is a $1 discount off everything. This is definitely a place to try, but not a place I'd frequent!
This restaurant is an example to show the power of advertising can it twist your mind. The waiting time was 1:45 min, during which it took almost 20 min to clean the table. We tried 2 types of burgers and both was normal if not less. Nothing special about the meat, no difference between the well done and medium! And the reply was 'its made to your order'. The only thing I liked was the fries dipping. Dont waste your time and money...
Wow.... I was looking forward to a delicious, burger with quality ingredients and a concern for preparation. Sat at the bar, ordered a guinness and the blue burger. I also ordered the parmesean fries.  Then it went downhill.. The bartender made a huge deal out of me ordering it medium rare - "are you sure, that's going to be red in the middle?" Yep - that's what I want.  . . Then, of course, it comes and it is barely pink in the center.  I forgive the cook because the patty was about 5oz.  How would you get that to MR? Then I tasted it.  Yes, I have had maytag blue cheese, yes, I know its strong. NO - I didn't expect it to be all I tasted and with the rind put on the burger. I tried getting thought it because I didn't want to get ripped by the bartender again. I couldn't.  I left 3/4 on the plate. When she asked if everything was OK - I explained.  She asked if I wanted to order anything else.... for a moment I thought she was offering to replace it.  Nope, just wanted to know if I wanted more food.  Um - why would I spend another $20 on more food when this is so bad.. . The fries were good.
Went for my Birthday July 14th, this was my 3rd time there and the food was phenomenal as always. However the service was a little slower than usual and the place mats smelled like mold, we notified the waitress of the odor and she gladly removed the mats and cleaned the surface of the table with a disinfecting napkin.. . She apologized for the slow service and the smell and she kept a smile the whole time. After the end of our dinner she gave us these delicious push pop ice cream things for my birthday, they were amazing. And I can't wait to try Chef Ramsay's other restaurants in vegas.
The queue outside and empty tables a plenty inside should have been a warning sign. Great concept, being in the land of burgers and all, oh and mixing in a celebrity chef. Unfortunately, it does not work here. I've eaten many a burger in my time and this was by far the most long winded and protracted way to get an average burger I've ever had, plus the service was a let down. We were left waiting along with a queue of up to 30 people while seats lay empty inside ( waiting staff hung around for customers to be seated- my bug bear is this waiting to be seated rigmarole). Our waitress was charming but a little distracted. We needed to request to be served by another waiter. I ordered a well done burger, it was medium rare! Ok ok but to some that's undercooked. Our waitress kept asking were our ciders nice. We only had beer. So to summarise this is a place to be seen but in my experience bit of a let down.
OMG! This place was DELICIOUS. I was scared away every time I wanted to try this place because the wait was always an hour plus but I understand why now.. . I tried the Farm burger and it was just great. The meat was cooked perfectly and the duck bacon wrapped everything together. Yum!. . We also tried the truffle fries which were delicious and so flavorful. The house made ketchup and truffle sauce bind the fries together perfectly. . . The only disappointment was the Jalapeno 'Rita'. It was way too spicy and harsh.. . I was amazed on how delicious the food was. This is definitely a place to go every time you are in Vegas.
Tried BurGR for the first time during my last trip to Vegas. I don't think I've ever had a burger as delicious as this one. I had the American Burger. No frills: just American cheese, butter lettuce (a huge plus in my book: much better than romaine), onion, pickles and tomato on a fresh, fluffy bun. The burger was thick, cooked perfectly, and was so juicy. A little pricey for just the burger, but trust me,it's worth it. You are in Vegas, after all--it's worth the splurge!. . Oh, and the fries? You NEED to try the truffle Parmesan fries. I dream of the truffle aioli they're served with.  Keep in mind too the portion of fries is VERY large. A group of three would probably be satisfied with a single order. We had two orders of fries for a group of three and were more than stuffed by the end of the meal. . . If you're visiting Vegas, you need to have BurGR on your list of places to try. I will definitely going back during my next vacation!
Went back for the 2nd time in Vegas last week and am already looking forward to my next visit. The place screams contemporary Vegas. Giant flame display at the front of the place, Gordon's crazy face on the menu, the neon red bar, waitresses in tight spandex. It almost feels like a theme park of a restaurant. But the food delivers. The wings with blue cheese are amazing. The farm burger is great and truffle fries with fresh made dipping sauces, ah yes! Very friendly and speedy wait staff to boot.. . Little pricey but what isn't in Vegas?!. . Go GORDON OR GO HOME!
First the good.... The decor is awesome, they let you keep the menu and the servers are very good looking. The food was quick to the table and the chipotle ketchup was delicious.. . The downside, those good looking servers never cleared the empty dishes for our table. We were switched servers twice. We had the American burger and the Chanterelle burger, onion rings, truffle fries, two sodas and one shake and the bill was over $80. The onion rings had barely any onion in them,the buns were nice but the burgers were bland and not worth the over ten dollar price tag. The fries were soggy although plentiful and the shake with pudding on top was just too hard to eat.. . Another celebrity chef concept that is overpriced and doesn't deliver.
I had a burger called something with "hell's kitchen", it tasted great but was extremely hot/spicy, I had to take out the jalapenos
Great burger!. The farm burger was cooked perfectly.. . Very happy with the burger. Service was very nice too!
Slap a famous man's name behind a business and they all come running. Put it in Vegas and it's destined to be a goldmine. To me, burger's scream 'comfort food' and as such they should be filling, packed with flavour and have a very amazing bun to compliment the meat and fixings. . . I went here last year in hopes that the hype would resonate through the food. Al I have to say is - "ya, it was good". What I wanted to say was "this was the most amazing burger I've ever eaten" so I'm a bit disappointed. I was also expecting a great experience to compliment the eats but that fell short. . . I expected a bit of a wait since this restaurant was in Vegas and it was prime time for dinner rush. The decor and ambience of the place was cool and the service was great. The drinks were great and the prices were manageable. But the burgers were alright. . . I was expecting a flavour experience and really all I got was a burger that was as comparable to a local burger bar in Edmonton called Delux. . . Would I go back? Probably not. I will opt for other dining experiences that focus on different cuisine.
Food flavors were great service was terrible the waitress Spilled water on us never came to clean it up we had to send a burger back twice because it wasn't cooked to our specifications and they forgot a burger
Tried their 'signature hot dog' or dawg, with the fresh roasted chili, but honestly, the bun actually tasted better.  Quite good actually, some real freshness to it. Almost a crispy texture and a soft bite into it.. . The avocado was a nice touch.  One of the true good values, few if any, in Vegas lol. . . Will order again.  And their burger too possibly, too  many scary reviews here for that.  I knew I should've ordered one at Holstein's instead.
For some reason pay $100 for steak feels better than paying $21 for burger.  It's expensive and doesn't include fries.  It's not as good as I had expected but damn, it's good!
How disappointing. Not in the food necessarily- but in the experience. I left feeling bitter and a bit angry. The customer service had been terrible from the onset, with the worst being at the end. . We're standing in line and as we make it to the front we find ourselves being completely ignored because the hostesses have decided to compare nails and chat. Then after we get seated, the guy coming over to explain the drinks and get is situated was very friendly and we felt better and looked forward to our burgers. But then it turns out we had a different waitress who didn't greet us or say much of anything really. . So we order our food- I got the Hell's Kitchen- which admittedly tasted very very good. I hate to admit I ordered mine as medium-well ( I know, I know- stop cringing) and it came out a bit bloody. I didn't complain or ask to cook it more because we has already waited a half hour just to get it. So I ate it and it was very yummy, along with the sweet potato fries. . So things were going ok- the waitress was nice enough to let us split our check- so we calculated our meals and have her our cards, only for her to come back with our copies to sign, telling us we still have to pay $6 for the tax. Seriously? She couldn't do that? So fine, we added in extra and that was that. Then the woman who came to fill our waters literally knocked my water glass across the table- shattering in between my friend and I. No I'm sorry, no urgency- we were left trying to move so we didn't get soaked and picked up bits of glass, only for her to come back and lay some extra napkins on our table and leave. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So we're left there trying to pick up all the bits of glass without getting cut. I didn't realize until a bit later that there was a huge shard right behind me- so I picked up and stuck it on the napkin on the table. And the waitress comes back, only to grab the napkin with the glass in it and walk away. No apologies, no checking to see if we're okay. Nothing!!! I couldn't believe it! What kind of crazy service is that? I never complain and I wS actually tempted to, but figured I'd just write a review instead. . . So yeah. Food is good, but not worth having to deal with the people working there. Go to Earls Sandwich instead!
Since I watch Hell's Kitchen I decided to try this restaurant.  We went on a Wednesday around 1130am and did not have to wait at all for a table.  The atmosphere was nice but since it is located inside of a Casino it was a little loud.. . The food was great!  We had the Farm Burger, Hell's Kitchen Burger, Just Fries, and Shake #4 (creme brulee pudding and oreo shake).  I am personally not a fan of creme brulee or oreos but our server highly recommended it so I gave it a try...surprisingly AMAZING!  The shake was definitely sweet and I probably would not be able to drink the whole thing myself, but it was perfect to share.. . The customer service from our server, Ian, was great!!  However, the hostesses at the front were not that friendly at all.  . . If there was an option I would give this restaurant a rating of 4.5
SHORT VERSION: We will definitely be back. . . LONG VERSION: We had what was called a Farm Burger. It had an over easy egg on it, sharp cheddar cheese, and duck bacon. The bun was homemade and fresh with both black and regular sesame seeds. Ordered cooked to medium. The burger was so good. Rich and delicious and hit the spot. I bet I'll crave that burger and end up back here again next trip. Jalapeno poppers were a little spicy for my palate but the ranch type sauce they were in was delish'. Parmesan truffle fries were good but I could take them or leave them. We'll tryeither the onion rings or sweet potato fries next time. I've heard other Yelpers say the onion rings are amazing. We shared the burger along with the poppers and fries and still left a ton of fries and 2 poppers on the table. We finished the burger. :). . To add, we ate at 5:30pm on a Thursday; table for two. The wait was only about ten minutes. Our waiter was friendly and attentive.
This place is my newest addiction! I can't wait to go to Vegas to come back here!! The service was great and the food was amazing!!! Burgers are cooked perfectly.
GReat burgers at GReat prices. Stays open till late. The best part is the eclectic choice of gourmet burgers that live up to the hype around celebrity chef, Gordon Ramsay ( I do not suppose he is behind the kitchen screaming choicest words at his sous chefs!). Been there twice- and just for the juicy patties, the soft sesame buns and fresh ingredients that make the Vegas experience from bla to good. The southwest burger is really really good (I prefer chicken).  My rant that keeps it away from 5 stars- The servers are very snooty somehow! The staff looks overburdened from serving all the weary Vegas crowd. Part of the reason why they first handed out an Ipad for looking through the menu- to minimise human contact. It takes a long time for them to serve you but the wait is well- worth it. I'd go again- for the BurGRs.
Overall my experience at BurGR was alright. Sabrina our waitress was AWESOME! She's the main reason I'm writing this review. We had a table of 8 and she handled it like a pro. . Food: 4/5- I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was really good. If you like spicy, this is for you. Other burgers ordered at my table were the bleu burger, farm burger, American burger, Britannia burger and the yardbird burger. Along with the burgers, we all ordered either the truffle or the plain fries. The aioli that comes with the truffle fries are amazing! But there were so many that I don't think anyone finished their fries. . . Service:. Hostesses: 2/5- we were able to put our names down on the list and they texted us when our table was ready. But our original group was 6 and grew to 8. When I went to ask the hostess if it would be possible to change our number, she looked at me like I was crazy and then told me she would have to add between 15-30 mins on top of what we were already quoted to wait, making our total wait time a little under an hour. I totally understood until the group of 6 of us got seated and there was plenty of space to add another small table if not the empty table for two that was already there next to us. Luckily our friends still showed up and were able to be seated with us since the other waiters found an extra table and chair. . . Waiter/waitresses: 7/5- yeah I know my math doesn't make sense but all of the wait staff was amazing. Our main waitress (Sabrina) took our orders and even asked which people were together when we asked if it would be possible to split our checks. There was a gratuity already on the bill but she deserved waaaayyyy more than what was on there. She constantly came by to check on us and refill our waters since we were thirsty and dehydrated from the weather.
I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars just for the oreo creme brulee shake and service. . Burger was good, but not amazing. . Chicken wings were juicy and the sauce was delicious but I couldn't taste anything else afterwards. . Truffle fries, good but had better. . Asian salad with soba noodles - don't order. noodles were super overcooked. . Service was great and seemed like everything was running smoothly.. . We enjoyed our meal here and will be back for the oreo shake!
The name Gordon Ramsey is synonymous with delicious Gourmet... And his Burgr restaurant is beyond any star rating I can give .. if you come here you will set a standard that may never be reached .. A hamburger is no longer a hamburger but now forever will be known to me as Burgr.
Good service, great presentation of meals and taste burgrs thanks for having lagunitas on tap. Just need fresher avacado but it is understandable with how much is on the shells kitchen burger. My wife loves burgers and loved hers. Also the jalapenos where really spicy and good. Recommended everything here and the jalapenos poppers amazingly good.
Great experience last night at Burgr. We were thoroughly impressed with the food and service. Our waiter, Ryan, did a fantastic job even though he was getting hammered with tables. We had an American burger which was awesome. The 28 day aged burger was the BEST I had ever had. It was cooked perfectly. We had the truffle fries which were amazing as well. We split Shake #4 and it was absolutely fantastic. We were thoroughly impressed with the entire visit and will be back in the future.
I don't know why people eat here. Really, why?. . We waited for an hour and a half. With a wait like that, I expected the best damn burger in the existence of man-kind.. Service was sub-par. The hostesses are the worst. They have no idea what's going on and ignore you half the time.. . Fries don't come with your burgers, FYI. I wasn't super shocked by this, but was shocked by the price. 8 dollars or more for some fries. They say they feed a group of people. I was with three large, hungry men. Definitely not feeding us all.. . I ordered the Brittania burger and an oreo shake. The mango chutney was good but there was hardly any of it. It was a tiny burger, too. I wasn't too upset about it because the shake was so giant. . The shake was... interesting. The creme brulee pudding mostly just tastes like sweet egg pudding. I get that creme brulee is mostly eggs, but it isn't supposed to taste like it.. The burger overall was sub-par AT BEST. I was expecting great meat. The meat was ok, I guess. I wasn't wowed with how tender or innovative the place is.. . At the end of the night, I was angry. I waited an HOUR AND A HALF to pay $36 for a sub-par meal. Not to mention the food made me sick, literally. I left ill. I went back to my hotel and laid on my bed in the fetal position because I was so sick.. . I wouldn't go back unless there was no wait and someone with me (like the people I was with) insisted that it's going to be amazing because it's Gordon Ramsey.
Never have I had a meal at a burger joint that was so well thought out, presented, executed and reasonably priced. The food was so above expectations that the dishes I had rivaled those of established and well known burger joints. . . The dishes were simple and comforting, well known and commonplace among the typical foods one finds at a burger joint but each had a twist and an added element that intrigued me. . . I didn't actually have a burger (it was a hot dog) but nevertheless every component of that meal was memorable. The quality of the meat and snap to the "dawg" delighted one texture. The creaminess of the avocado added another. The toppings were fresh. The fluffy on the inside and lightly crispy on the outside bun enveloped all that goodness.. . The jalapeno poppers were crunchy on the outside and the cheese was gooey on the inside. It was lightly spicy and the cheesy dipping sauce they were on top of was also a little spicy. . . The truffle fries were also well made and I crave them often. Nicely sized, fluffy on the inside and salty from the Parmesan. The hint of truffle oil came through nicely as well. . . For a weekday and party of two, we didn't wait long. The prices were fair and the food is one of the best you can find on the Strip for the prices especially because it's so well made and tasty.
I had the duck bacon burgr and it was the best I've ever had anywhere in the USA.  The burgr are fantastic.
Tastiest burgers on the strip! Clearly GR knows what he is doing when designing a menu, but this surpasses any other burger I've had. Great and attentive staff, quick service and all the quality. . Started with the parm fries with fresh made ketchup- so flavorful!  I had the mushroom burger.  Great taste, cooked perfectly. . Try the margaritas. .. so refreshing and delicious!. ****check in at hostess stand to be added to wait list and get a text alert when your table is ready!*****
This place was packed and we had to wait for over an hour to be seated.  It was well worth the wait.  I had the best burger I've ever eaten in my life.  It had duck bacon on it for God's sake!  I highly recommend this place.  Go here and have a burger, you will be glad you did.
Really nice place, if you're looking for innovative, high-techi vibe. . . I'm a big fan of gr, but I gotta say, the burger wasn't amazing as expected,  similar to the one at the Blt at the mirage. . . All in all, long wait, nice atmosphere, ok food.
Hell's Kitchen burger, part deux, and I was once again, not disappointed.  This time I ordered it medium well again, but this time it came out perfect.  I just freaking love this burger.  Roasted tomato, asadero cheese, avocado, delicious.. . The truffle fries this time around we sub par.  Soggy fries are not my friend.  These are thick cut fries, so it's easy to see howthey can end up being soggy, but this place should know how to do fries at the very least.  . . The shakes here are interesting.  They are ginormous, so definitely think about sharing them.  They are also super sweet.  I know what you are thinking.  Me, the dessert whore that I am, thinking something is too sweet.  Well, take my word for it.  If you're not into super sweet desserts, you might want to pass on the shake.  The shake is milkshake on the bottom, pudding on the top, topped with whipped cream and garnished with a cookie.  I was 1/4 into it and had to stop.  It was just too much.. . Our server was fantastic.  Super efficient, really friendly, but not over the top.  We were seated at the same time as another group of friends, and we were done a good 15 minutes before them.  No, we didn't eat any faster, we just had better service.  . . Don't forget your Total Rewards card. You get $1 off each menu item just for being a member.  Not bad.
If you're a hot dog lover, get your hot dog lovin' butt over to BurGR for one of the best all beef hot dogs you'll ever have.. . My mom and I both ordered the fresh roasted chili dawg--sans cheese. This was seriously a FLAVOR EXPLOSION. The hot dog had a genuine, juicy beef flavor and was slathered in tasty chipotle ketchup. I devoured this massively long hot dog at a record speed. Even the bun--the sweet, crisp bun--was a standout in comparison to hot dogs I've eaten in the past. With a tall beer and no sides, eating the whole dog left me satisfied. . . There was only one small trouble. Right before my mom took the last bite of her hot dog, she discovered a hair amidst all the juicy hotdog madness. She instantly felt grossed out by her meal, of course. The manager came to the table and removed the cost of her hot dog from our bill. She was so gracious about the whole thing that it didn't put a damper on our delicious lunch.. . Gordon Ramsey clearly dreamed up a unique vision of the classic chili dog and hot dogs will never be the same again now that BurGR raised my standards :(. . Awesome lunch spot in Vegas!
An intentional move to fuel the corporatized celebrity chef disease that has overtaken the wasteland of Vegas. Waited in a really long line for something that Gordon Ramsey would have been ashamed of had he not sold his soul to the devils of Sin City. . . ROASTED JALAPENO POPPERS - Cheddar bacon, cheddar ranch, one fiery surprise. . I think Gordy was trying to showcase his Michelin 3 star plating techniques by serving each popper in its own shot glass. Unfortunately this was about as exciting as it got for this appetizer. I love jalapenos, and these were soft and smoky, but the breading and the sauce struck me as quite low-end--greasy, cheap, & fake. . . FARM BURGER - duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, fried egg. . Mnnn, duck breast bacon!? Meh, not so much. It was overly salty and so strong that it detracted rather than contributed. The sharp cheddar went practically unnoticed (perhaps not sharp enough?). And while my companion's Farm Burger had a gloriously runny yolk, mine did not, which pissed on the entire experience. It wasn't ugly, but I'm sure that Gordy wouldn't have been satisfied. . . TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES - Hand cut fries, truffle Parmesan, truffle salt, truffle aioli. . These hand-cut fries tasted almost identical to the kind you can get in the frozen section of the grocery store. Sprinkling dry Parmesan on top didn't make it any more glamorous, plus none of it stayed on when you picked up a fry. And I didn't taste any truffle in the Parmesan or in the salt. It was served with some ketchup (meh) and truffle aioli, which was actually pretty good because it actually tasted truffly. . . SHAKE #4 - Creme brulee pudding, Oreo shake, Oreo cookie. . This was a lovely visual experience, but it didn't taste as pretty as it looked. The Oreo shake portion was passable, but the Creme brulee pudding was essentially just really thick Jello Instant Vanilla pudding, which no hint of burnt goodness. . . ALL IN ALL:. . Really, Gordy--have you ever eaten here? The food isn't awful, but do you really consider it worthy of your namesake? I wouldn't slap my name on any restaurant that I wasn't personally managing & vouching for. In doing so, you've diluted your brand, and in the end, people will view BurGR for what it really is--a mirage in the city of illusions.
I like to consider myself a burger connoisseur of sorts since a good burger is really hard to find these days. But I can honestly say that the burger I had at BurGR was one of the best I've EVER had (tied with Burgers in Paradise in Maui)!! I had a quick dinner at BurGR with a friend who is a vegetarian; I had the Blue Burger and she had the Earth Burger. We also shared an order of the Truffle Parmesan Fries. We both couldn't stop saying how delicious our food was! I'm going back to Vegas in a couple weeks with my husband and I can't wait to take him there. . . The line was quite long and we waited about an hour for a table but I would say it's worth the wait!
Still pretty awesome.  We started with the pork buns.  The pork was delicious and had a very good mouth feel.  The chicken sliders were tasty (but Chick-fil-A is better).. . I've tried the Euro Burger, the Chanterelle Burger, The Hog (pork) Burger, and also the Fish Sandwich.  ALL were very tasty.  You have to get the Truffle Fries.  Yum.  But you can skip the Sweet Potato fries.  They put powdered sugar on the fries which make them taste weird.. . I also got the #1 shake which has the caramel pudding on top.  OMG, it was so good!  It sufficed for dessert.  The little cookie garnish was delicious!
We ate dinner here with my parents, who have dined here before. Hubby and I both had the Hell's Kitchen burger with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado and oven roasted tomato and we shared a Innis & Gunn.  Our family shared sides of the beer battered maui onion rings with dips - parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip, sweet potato fries with vanilla powdered sugar and honey jalapeno mayo and the hand cut fries with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup.  Our burgers were perfectly medium-well and flavorful, the sides were crispy and it was hard to choose a favorite dip - they were all good. Our daughter had one of their yummy pudding shakes - coconut pudding + strawberry shake + chocolate cookie. That evening we even saw Christine from Hell's Kitchen season 10 working behind the counter.
BEST BURGER EVER! i had the hells kitchen burger and me and my friend shared the truffle tries. it was amazing. so juicy and delicious....  go, run!
Me: Bites into the burger. Me: 0.0. Me: (does best impersonation of Gordon Ramsay) this burger is #$(@* AMAZING!. . So how does BurGR stack up against other popular burger joints in Vegas? Here is my definitive list:. . 1) BurGR. 2) Bachi. 3) Holstein. ...... 100000) Burger Bar. . First off, the decor here is awesome. Who doesn't love live flames everywhere, especially in the middle of PH. It's pretty much, Hell's Kitchen. ;). Onto the food! The Euro burger was a hogwash blend of aromatic truffle aioli and goat cheese. Every bite was packed with savory flavors. Additionally, the truffle fries here are darn amazing. Thick cut and fried into crispy golden slices of heaven. My gf and I agreed that the Euro burger was one of the best burgers we've ever had!. . Overall, my only complaints were the snotty server and long wait time to be seated and fed (45 minutes). She was not very friendly and she gave us attitude when we tried to use our total rewards card... However, even questionable service still doesn't compare to the impeccable food. Furthermore, the long wait only made us savor the food more. . . If this is the kitchen in Hell... and Gordon Ramsay is the lord of the underworld... I'm fine with trading my soul for this burger. XD.
Not impressed - seems more like a tourist attraction rather then a restaurant.. . Food was so so. My burger was medium well, but it was way to dry and way too much meat in proportion to everything else. Not a good balance.. . if you want to experience Gordon Ramsey food and great atmosphere go to his Pub and Grille at Caesars Palace or Steak at Paris.
Hell's Kitchen burger, truffle fries, and jalapeno poppers is all I gotta say!! Absolutely fantastic. This is our go to spot every time my husband and are in Vegas! Customer service from the hostess's to the servers, to the bussers are always fantastic.
I am a big fan of Gordon Ramsay. I've watched his shows (Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares UK and USA, Masterchef) and been intrigued as to which of his Vegas restos (he got 3 here) should I try first. BurGR seemed to be the best choice to start (and the cheapest).  The 30 min wait was expected. Bleh.... . Food: I got the $14 Farm Burger (duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar cheese and a fried egg), $7 Just Fries with curry and chipotle ketchup, and the $8 Shake #5 (chocolate hazelnut pudding with coffee shake and a praline cookie).. . First off, let's talk about the burger. The burger was good with the oozing, decadent egg yolk and the crispy bacon which added a nice crunch component. I honestly though wasn't blown away by it and I would probably would want to try the other burgers on the menu if i came back here again.. . Secondly, the shake was rich and sweet. I thought the coffee shake tasted like a butterscotch candy in liquid form and the pudding was pretty thick. The one thing I would change would be the ratio. I noticed the glass that they put 1/2 the amount of pudding and 1/2 of the shake. When I finished the shake portion on the bottom, all I was left with was the pudding. Being that it was soooo rich, I wasn't able to finish that. So next time, I would ask for 95% shake and 5% pudding. FYI, i overhead a lady next to me telling the waiter she didn't like her shake bc it was too sweet. . . Lastly, the fries. I didn't care much for the fries. The curry and chipotle ketchups were ok tasting. The one thing that I was disappointed in was that the fries were not crispy AT ALL. When the bacon in your burger is crispy and your fries are not, it really downgrades the experience. I would probably try the sweet potato fries next time.. . Ambience: Though i wasn't really impressed with the food, this was probably one of the nicest restos i've ever seen! The room had a lot of tables with some tvs and really nice decor (flames and fire inspired). . . Staff: The staff was very well-dressed and professional. Our server (I think his name was Ryan) was great and he was very cordial and knowledgable about menu. The ladies are dressed in very well-fitted (like Star Trek fitted) dresses and the men are in polos with jeans that I observed had "GR" on the back pockets. . . "I have a very assertive way. Its wake up, move your ass, or piss off home." - Gordon Ramsay
Truffle Fries for the Win.   Do you know what it feels like to hit a jackpot in Vegas?  Try them and you will know.  . . Burgers are great as well.  Burgers will feel like you won a hand and the fries will feel like you hit a jackpot.
I've watched your show many times (Hell's kitchen and nightmare kitchen ) so I decided to try out your recipe. Had that Britannia burger? Awesome, that was a . I liked they way they cooked and very presentable ... To me that was A plus.. . The ambience is very cool and nice. Very clean environment , nice utensils, beautiful waitresses and waiters an A Plus too. But only the tables are small,what if you ordermore than one dish? Where are they gonna put the rest of the foods? It's just like tables are only for the petite /small peeps
I'm a Gordon Ramsay fanboy so his BurGR (Planet Hollywood) and Steak (The Paris) restaurants were at the top of my list. While the latter didn't pan out (asking people to drop $100+ each on a meal isn't easy), the former did. . . We stopped in on a Friday night and the place was rammed. We saw a huge line up but weren't sure what to make of it. The lovely hostess informed me there would be an hour and a half wait. I haven't heard those words in a long time in terms of getting a seat at a restaurant and initially balked. However, they offered a texting service for when your table was ready. EVERY RESTAURANT NEEDS TO DO THIS! I don't want a buzzer that had a range of 10 feet. Send me a text. My face is buried in my phone anyway. The three of us hit another bar for drinks, my phone went off an hour later and we were set. No excess waiting around.. . Roasted Jalapeno Poppers - $12. I wasn't sure what to make of $12 Jalapeno Poppers. You typically have this idea in your mind of a slice of Jalapeno, dumped in low grade Cream Cheese and fried in some generic batter. These were anything but that. First of all, each of these Poppers was a BEAST! It's not just what's atop the Cheddar Ranch dipping sauce. They're submerged in the shot glasses. The Jalapenos were covered in Bacon and Cheddar Cheese, battered, coated and fried. Every bite had a great crunch before bursting with the Pepper/Cheese/Bacon combination. These have ruined me from all other Jalapeno Poppers.. . Hell's Kitchen Burger - $14. It's essentially their Spicy Burger, though the elements seemed strange. With the exception of roasted Jalapenos, there wasn't anything "spicy" about it. I'm surprised there wasn't anything like Horseradish Sauce or a spiced Mayo thrown into the mix. The Peppers were even cooled by Avocado. Props for using Asadero Cheese. Usually you'd find that in Quesadillas or Burritos down south. If anything I'd call this a Mexican Burger before "Hell's Kitchen." While the toppings were fine, the patty was spot on. The burgers are grilled a lightly seasoned, perfect Medium Rare. The bun was well toasted (maybe a hair too much) and brought it all together. . . Just Fries - $8. I believe "UGH" applies here. For a place with such exceptional food, it's shocking how piss poor these Fries were. The temperature was lukewarm at best. There was no sense of crispness. The potatoes themselves were limp. The only saving grace was the Curry & Chipotle Ketchup respectively. A little research from other reviews shared my sentiment so it's not like we just got a bad batch. Gordon Ramsay BurGR simply sells AWFUL Fries. I think it's made all the worse knowing these terrible Fries are $8. Do NOT order these.. . Farm Burger - $15. I used to be adamantly against Yolk. I still won't eat a runny Egg with my breakfast. However, I've come to appreciate the elevation it brings to other dishes. Case in point, the Farm Burger. I mulled it over for days after eating this, but right now I'd call this the best Burger I've ever eaten. Everything just came together so well. The patty was spot on. The Duck Breast Bacon (I didn't even know that was a thing) was flavourful and crispy. You really got a strong sense of Bacon in every bite. The English Sharp Cheddar was nice though it didn't bring that knockout punch I expect from sharp Cheddar. The Egg was the key though. My God why haven't I been eating Eggs on every Burger since the beginning of my life? The whites were firm and the Yolk was just consistent enough that it didn't explode all over the place. I was over the moon with this Burger and it likely showed on my face. I gave serious consideration to ordering another one but was too blown up. A sharper sense of Cheddar and this would have been perfect as opposed to you know... my favourite.. . If you're looking for a damn good Burger, then Gordon Ramsay BurGR is your spot. Fries aside (again DON'T ORDER THEM!) everything else lived up to the standard I was expecting.
the best thing that ever graced my tongue was the sticky toffee push pops they were so good i had to order 2 orders. . the farm burger was pretty good (that duck bacon was my selling point) and the parmesean truffle fries were really really good. id come back just 4 the toffee push pops w/ its peanut buttery ice cream goodness
The food & service was terrific! Chef Ramsey has set the bar for every burger joint. I love how at the end of the meal you can rate everything with an iphone that they give you with your bill. By far the best burger spot!!!
One of the best burgers I've ever eaten. Tried the Hell's Kitchen burger & euro burger, truffle fries & reg fries all were just delicious. We had eaten at Hoisteins for burgers & these was probably even better for a little less $$$&. Def will eat here again when in Vegas
Ok, so I must begin by saying that I am a huge GR fan! BurGR didNOT disappoint. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and my husband had the Blue Burger. We shared an order of truffled parmesan fries. . Everything was AMAZING! The service was great. The food prompt and perfectly cooked. I would eat here regularly if I lived near! . Well done!!!
This is generally a very good burger/bar food joint on the strip. The food tastes great and the atmosphere is fun, but service is very slow and the prices are fairly high. The jalapeno poppers looked incredible though.
The wait for this restaurant can be very LONG. Luckily, the wait time is much shorter if you have only 2 people in your party. My friend and I waited about 30 minutes for dinner on a Sunday night. . . We got seated in the corner next to the servers computer/water station. It was a very inconvenient seat, because the servers are constantly crowding near you. It felt intrusive almost. . . Ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger with the truffle fries. The fries are thick steak fries. I thought the flavors were nice and the side of ketchup was good. The burger was juicy and the burger was overall flavorful and good. . . One big complaint was our server- Ginger. She was really kind in the beginning, but after she took our order, she NEVER came back. We had to ask other servers for our requests- water/napkins/etc..
I've been here twice and it's been a great experience both times. The line can get kinda long so i would recommend just sitting at the self-seating bar and you don't have to wait in line if there is an open seat!. . I got the Euro Burger and Truffle fries which was both really good, The truffle aioli is great!. . I also tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger which is probably my favorite burger so far but just be careful because it packs some heat and can be spicy to some.
There r "burger places" popping up all over.  Most, r low yield. GRB is THE BEST by a wide margin.  The burger with duck bacon is incredible.  The shakes r awesome too.  The only down note is that the chairs seem too low for the table, so we usually eat at the bar.  Enjoy!!
I loved this place! It is absolutely unique from the crazy flame display in front to the varied menu.  It was one of thee hardest decisions of my life deciding what to get because everything sounded so good.. . I went with the farm burger and it's basically like a breakfast burger, but the duck bacon has this delicious smoky flavor and the sharp cheddar cheese was a perfect pairing.  The BEST Onion Rings I've ever had, beer battered, huge, and had a great presentation.  I couldn't wait to try the shake when I heard it was half pudding and we got the highly recommended chocolate hazlenut, I had already premeditated ordering that as soon as the waitress asked for our drinks you can believe it didn't last long. My friend tried the hot dog and that was next level! You've probably seen the pictures, but the meat is very high quality - not your typical lips and asses. . . I can't wait torevisit  Burgr and explore the rest of the menu in depth.  I was really debating getting the Truffle fries or the fish and chips, but didn't want to get too bogged down before a wild night on Vegas.. . Service was on point, the only problem was lack of stomach space so I could try everything!
Delicious!!! Must try Hell Kitchen Burger and fries!. . Gregg is the best server! Really great customer service!!!
I was excited to try out Gordon Ramsay restaurant but it was a disappointment. I wasn't impress with the burgers and they got the meats cooked wrong. The only good thing was the beer.
Being a local and trying to find a restaurant that is worth the money is very hard. I can say that I had a very high expectation of this place because of the name Gordon Ransay. It fulfilled every expectation I had and I will recommend this place to anyone who wants a fantastic burger experience.. . We arrived and waited in line for about 15 minutes, which is not bad all for what is was and located. We took our 2 year old and they were accommodating and had our table ready with high chair and all. Our waitress was very friendly and even tried winning over our son with 2 Oreo cookies, which was very nice of her.. . We looked over the bar menu and they have several beer on tap and in bottles, but come on try one on tap because they are different. My husband ordered the Innis and Gunn beer because that is the one Chef Ramsay drinks all the time and is his favorite. I don't like beer but let me tell you, this beer was AMAZING!!!!!!!!! . . We ordered 2 Southern Yardbird Burgers. It's comes with a chicken burger, sharp cheddar, mustard bbq sauce, pickles (bread & butter), and butter lettuce. We also added the Just Fries that came with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup. The chicken burger were so big and thick that I couldn't even finish mine and I was full half way through it. The taste of it was so amazing that I would order this every time I go back. Such an AMAZING burger.. . I highly recommend this place to everyone in my family and to all my friends. So everyone that comes to Vegas and want a reasonable priced meal at a famous chefs restaurant, I recommend Gordon Ramsay's BurGR.
3.5 stars. . Went on a Tuesday, arrived at 11 am (opening) about 20 people in line but all we're seated quickly so no complaints on the wait.. . I ordered the American burger and Just fries (regular potato fries with chilli ketchup and curry ketchup).  It was too much food for one girl but I knew that going in, I just had to try them both.  The fries would be a good size for two Canadian girls to share.. . The burger was 3*'s all the way.  My biggest disappointment, the bun.  Looked great but tasted just ok, further to that the texture was almost stale and chewy.  It had been grilled (heated) at some point but not recent to arriving to me.  The beef was tasty and well cooked.  There were 4 pickles and 2 tomato chunks teetering on top of the burger which made it difficult to close but even more difficult to get a bite of burger with pickle and tomato on it.  I know a lot of places do that but I still don't like it... Spread the love.... Don't stack.  Oh, and too many redonions for my liking.... A whole thick slice.. . The fries were 4*'s, large chunks of English style fries cooked golden brown, yes I agree with previous reviews - the ones at the bottom of the serving container get a tad soggy (but they're still delicious!).. . The curry ketchup won best overall and biggest surprise at 5*'s.  It paired perfectly with the fries and was extremely addicting.  It's worth adding I did not think I would like curry ketchup, at all.  . . Dining alone I ate at the bar, service was pretty lame at first until some loser decided to stand behind me waiting for my seat and for me to finish my wine at which point the bar tender made it clear to me that I was to relax and enjoy myself and told the DB to wait somewhere else.. . I wasn't wowed but the overall experience, especially since it's called BURGR (and that was the biggest fail) but there are some good qualities.  I probably wouldn't go there again unless I tried the other burger places on the strip and they were worse.
I'll start by saying the food was absolutely wonderful. Would have earned a perfect rating if not for the a few little set backs. . . Ok I get it, I went Saturday night it was busy. However that is not an excuse to be rude. We all have long days at work etc etc. When the nice little host was approached to ask a question not only does she rudely reply "get in line" with a why are you bothering me attitude, but also there is a sign saying see host before standing in line... Also she did not make eye contact when talking to me. Both of the hosts sat there and talked to each other no "sorry for the wait" "you will be seated shortly" nothing! . . Next they literally fit as many tables into the smallest space ever. I felt like I was packed in like a sardine the party next to us was elbow length away, granted I did go on a busy night but still. . . Besides that the food was spectacular my burger was great. Overall good food for a good price.
Absolutely horrible service! This is one of the worst places I have ever been. The hostesses were so rude and even the manager walked around with like an arrogant, unhelpful jerk. The waiters were great, but otherwise everything else was awful. The food was just alright, nothing to write home about and definitely not worth the price. I will never return and neither will the entire group I was with.
Absolutely the best burger I have ever had. If you like it a little spicy try the Hell's Kitchen sandwich.
We had a great lunch! Megan was our server, she was very helpful and attentive! She also gave us information about the chef and Gordon Ramsay. The food is awesome and the truffle fries with the dip! Yummmm. I ordered the euro burger and it was bomb! Restaurant was very clean. The wait wasn't that bad. I would definitely recommend and come back next time I'm around the area!
awesome place my wife and I loved the food and the customer service.. we will eat here when he come back to los Vegas.. burger are  awesome an their fires and onions rings
Saw all the positive reviews and felt that we had to pay this place a visit. The place looks nice and created high expectations. First negative was the wait time...on a Monday! We ordered the European, a Hell's Kitchen, fries and a no.5 shake. The shake was absolutely delicious! Then came the rest of our order. The fries were salty...I mean SALTY! Too much and we only ate a few. The burgers were ok, not as special as we had expected. If this would have been it then I would probably have ended this review with 3 stars. Two hours later though the wifey had to throw up to get the burger out of her system after having been noxious for some time. Not a good experience at Ramsay's.
THE best burger I have EVER had!!! Without a doubt! My sister and I shared the Farm Burger and added avocado. Perfect to share since we also ordered the delicious Honey Bao Buns, Truffle Parmesan Fries, and Onion Rings! ALL worth it! The patty was cooked perfectly, my only complaint is that the egg was cooked well done and I asked for it over medium (-.5 star). . . The wait is a bit long for large parties, but I can see why! If u are a party of 2, you can wait in line to be seated which seemed to go by fast. They don't do take out which kinda sucks (-.5 star). . . All in all this place is definitely worth waiting and trying. The Master Chef knows his burgers and shows it at this restaurant!
Vegas ... ah Vegas. You are indeed a land of hyper sensitive seduction and debilitating travesty all wrapped up in a bedazzled jockstrap. . . This is a story of conspiracy, longing, of askance glances, rushed introductions, missed opportunities, and figgy-onion jam. That damn jam.. . It began in Planet Hollywood, where after a 6-hour drive from Cali, I'm exhausted, sunburned, and starving. . . Then BURGR's beatific signage loomed before me at that wondrous moment. I swear I hear angels chorusing (amongst BURGR's blazing ring of hellfire decor) Why, yes, I do want a hearty, meaty, juicy meal. Why yes, I want this meal done good. Why yes, a Gordon Ramsey establishment satisfies that level of cooking skills of awesome nommy-ness that my belly needs. . . But that serendipitous moment did not transcend. Nay. I was denied by the majority (broke people). And then thus ushered to the nearby buffet, where I consoled myself in steamed mussels in what is called Le booby prize. Resentment brewed in my gut as well as indigestion. Why do we always succumb to this buffet tradition? Why do we fear this volatile, plate throwing, angry chef man? . . But my tirade was abruptly aborted, when I went into what as known as a food stupor. This is not exactly aligned with the condition known as food coma. Food coma usually attacks as you are awake or attempting a movement like sitting. Food stupor made me forget what I was going to say and just mindlessly gnawed on a chicken bone.. . Later, at 3am I was stirred out of bed with the screech of alarms and a rush of water flooding the hallway of our 32nd floor. Realizing this was not the steamed mussels talking, I got up. Someone tampered with the sprinklers. Our hallway turned into a moat in 20 minutes. That was just as long as it took to get security up there, banging on our doors to shoo us down to the lobby. So somewhere between being denied a dine-in at BURGR and a faulty sprinkler, I'm trekking my ass through a swamp of dirty carpet, and left to camp out in PH's lobby in my pajamas. Bad tan, indigestion, insomnia and all.. . At 530am, I've been awake for 20 straight hours. I'm suffering through the sensations of grumbling steamed mussels, whiny drunks, and gnarly-looking divas, and as if to mock me for a lifetime of bad decisions: BURGR's signage is still looming over the lobby. Will it never end? So I was wrong to deny you! Cut me some slack! But nothing. Vegas why you wrong me so?! Can I blow $100 on some black jack and we call it a truce? . . When we finally were relocated to a suite after the moat disaster, we were granted something I would've never foretold in this whole debacle: . . A $150 voucher to BURGR. . . Oh yeah. So I told myself, I can just sleep 3 hours and head out into the 108 degree heat. I can hang until BURGR opens and line up for 2 hours. Two hours, dude, with two kids. The wait had better be worth it. . . I speak of askance glances because the man who sat us at the table was too good looking for his own good. Was he a long lost Gosling or something? Rushed intros because after waiting for 2 hours, we didn't even hear our server speaking over our drooling and gnashing of teeth. Missed opportunities because I went with the chanterelle burger and its confusing onion figgy jam. . . The patty was juicy, cooked just right. But I have to admit it: the meat was barely warm edging to cold. I think the figgy-onion jam had something to do with that, because that jam was cold too in a way that it was previously chilled and turning warm after absorbing the meat's heat. The chanterelle mushrooms on top of this jam, I couldn't distinguish their flavour. It was overall sweet with some wisp of umami taste.  But the sweet flavour still had a bland taste. I really wanted some salt. None of the flavours sang to me. The angels had been silenced. . . Thus, my regret. I've always been a cheeseburger girl, I dunno what I was thinking. But I put on my best happy face, as I didn't want to be That Chick at the table, pissing on everyone else's fun cuz my burger was kinda sweet and cold (sounds like something an ex would call me).. . Missed opportunity, my friends. I had longed for a chance to dine at a place like this. While everyone else seemed to fall madly in love their burgers, I was silently underwhelmed. The truffle fries are good, sweet potato fries dare I say better. It would've been a perfect meal if I had just gotten the right burger for me. . . I would pass on that jam next time. Get the one with the cheese and the egg, and top it off with a shake. If you can't do it for yourself, do it for me.
Burgers were great, but on the small side. Great flavors and juicy. The problem we had was that our fries came out cold and the dip they came with was just plain odd. LOL Chipotle and ketchup don't really mix. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and I enjoyed it. Our server was just OK. Didn't seem to be a people person which is weird if you are a server. I will be back because I really enjoyed my Burger and I love Gordon.
Best burger I've ever had... That's a bold statement!!!!! I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger.  My husband had the Farm burger. Both were equally amazing.  And we got the Parmesan Truffle fries. So so good.  Usually,  I put salt,  pepper, hot sauce on my food. ... Didn't need to add any of that to my burger.. . We went last Sunday around 6 pm. Waited 35 minutes. .. But whatever.... You got the miracle mile shops to pass the time. Worth the wait!!!! . . . Our server was helpful, fun, and the fries and drinks come out quick. . . HIGHLY recommended to those that love good food.
This place is simply phenomenal! My girlfriend and I LOVED this place. Best burgers and fries ever! The staff was absolutely wonderful!! Highly recommend anyone try this place at least once.
Great food!  Snickerdoodle shake was fantastic!
I can't even tell you how much I loved this restaurant! I'm a diehard Gordon Ramsay fan and have vowed to eventually visit all of his restaurants around the world! Last visit in Vegas I went to Steak (which was mouth-wateringly delicious) and this time in Vegas I convinced a few friends of mine to come with me to have the best burGRs of their lives! It was my husband's birthday and there was quite a wait but it didn't even matter because of what was to come (plus your in the great planet hollywood resort and casino with tons to do while you wait). We started our meal off with the jalapeno poppers which were such a treat! You get six delicious jalapeno poppers and one of the six is a "surprise" (all of its stems and seeds, which create the heat, remain in the jalapeno). I was so excited to get the surprise jalapeno since my idol GR claims that the one who gets the surprise popper is the lucky one in Vegas. Nice personal touch! Moving on the star dish! I had the Euro BurGR and I usually like my meat medium but I took a risk and had medium rare as the chef recommends and it was something I do not regret in the least bit! It was the juiciest burGR I've ever had! All of the different elements and ingredients perfectly harmonized together. From the toasted black and white sesame seeds on top of the bun to the oven roasted tomato and goat cheese which added a zingy taste of heaven in my mouth. The arugula and truffle aioli were just the perfect touch to the perfect burGR. I also tried the uber cheese burGR which my husband had ordered and it was just as amazing. Gooey ooey cheese stretched for miles on end with every scrumptious bite. The onion rings were the perfect amount of crisp and came with amazing chipotle ketchup. This is definitely a place that I'd go back to the next time I'm in Vegas and I can't wait for my final stop restaurant of Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill! I really can't wait to visit all of his restaurants eventually and maybe my fourth time in Vegas he'll open another one! That would be phenomenal just like him and his success!
This review is a few weeks late but...it's true! The most incredible burgers ever! And I'm not even a huge beef fan. I had the Farm Burger; it was EPIC. Also tried my friend's Hell's Kitchen Burger, a tad on the spicy side. Both were cooked to a medium rare perfection, just the right serving size, and the price isn't too much for the quality! . . Oh and you are going to want to try the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers. Delicious and awesome presentation.. . Only downside I can think of is the wait time. We waited a good 45-50 minutes for a table on a late Monday afternoon. But Miracle Mile is right there for the browsing and does a good job of working up your appetite! I totally think it was worth the wait and would gladly wait again. Definitely one of the highlights of my last Vegas trip, without a doubt, and can't wait to go back to try another fantastic burger. . . Good job as usual, Mr. Ramsay!
AMAZING burgers...ate here (3) times in one weekend while I had visitors in town.
I was looking forward to trying this place, to see how exactly Ramsay would elevate his burgers. What I found however was a mixed bag. . . The service was phenomenal. And the highlight of my visit. Our server was very knowledgable of the menu and eager to share recommendations and describe the dishes. He returned several times throughout the meal to check on us. . . The food, however, was not the over-the-top experience I expected and for the price, quite frankly, a disappointment. The bun was fluffy and tasty but my burger, which I ordered medium, was overdone and dry. . . I have been back to BurGR since but still feel its a pricey spot when other alternatives exist nearby.
Huge fan of Ramsey and I was so fascinated I was in his restaurant. However, got the farm burger and kept trying to convince myself it was special, but really, it was just a normal beefy patty with bacon and eggs. Compared to Umami burger, I was dissapointed. $15 for a burger I can make myself :p
Wonderful place. Love that you can check in and leave your number. They text you when ever your table is ready so you don't neeed to wait in front of the resturabt for hours. The beer I tried was the Innis and Gunn. Props to the waiter for suggesting it. It is an amazing beer from Scotland. I recommend that if you are a fan of tap beer.
Had the farm burger which was okay but nothing great. Burger had no flavor and the fries, which don't come with the burger, were stale. Setting is very Hell's Kitchen like and staff is attentive and provides great service. But for the price it's just not worth it. Save yourself some cash and go grab a burger at In N Out instead .
