Attended the AVB event on 6/19/14 at Marquee Nightclub.. . The Will-call line was poorly managed. People kept appearing in front of me after I'd been waiting in line for over half an hour. Not cool! Get some barriers to stop people from pushing in.. . To enter the club we had to walk up multiple flights of ugly metal stairs.. not a particularly great first impression to a Vegas super-club (!). . Once inside it was pretty crowded, but this was made better as the nightclub opened out onto the day-club. . . Drinks were expensive (as expected) but quite strong and tasted pretty good! . . In my opinion the dance floor itself is too small for the size of the club and promotes a huge crowd of people pushing to get to and from the dance floor. It also makes getting to the bathrooms really difficult.. . Overall my friends and I had a really fun night and I would go back again!
My first Vegas night club.  WOW!! just wow!! Love the flashing strobe lights it's out of control...what? what? So many different  rooms to go to. Didn't like waiting in line in heels but it was worth the wait! Wanna go back now!!
This is for the day club. If you are a jersey boy roided up, a LA wanna-be or a total tool then this is your kinda place - you'll love it. The music over 3 days granted it was m, t, w got better by the day but only went from a 5 to a 7.... The bouncers are rude and go out of their way to be jerks. . It's a scene or be seen sort of place with the models errrr  waitresses holding bottles to deliver over their heads. . We only went there caz we were in a bungalow and that was the closest pool. The pool is shallow and therefore is about 85 degrees but cooler than the air.
Went here for a bachelorette and they said my small beach bag was too big and that I had to pay $30 for a locker so my gf came with me to the lockers. Then we walked back and they then said her bag which was a small purse was also too big (another $30). I guarantee they make commission on those locker fees. It was 5pm when we checked in also so we paid $60 for an hour of jersey shore trash. Never again.
Although i've been here over 10 times, this is my first review. The atmosphere is great, the drinks are tasty, but so damn crowded at all times! 4th of July was insanely packed. There was no room in the pool!
Update: I went backkkk.... and this time to the dayclub and the nightclub. SO MUCH FUN!! I love this place- got VIP tables both times, which is clutch. Service is awesome, the waitstaff and bouncers are extremely friendly. Arguably the best club we went to all weekend... Very chic!!
For the best partying during the day Marquee is the place to go! Youll love the ambiance and theres alway cite girls!!!!
Its always about the music. Its a nightclub you gotta have good music and this had place had Great music!!!! We went on a monday. We were put on a guest list so we went in for free. It was a bit hard to find i always get lost in the cosmo. Its just too jainormous. Didnt have any issues with my purse bein to big like other people were sayin. Everyone was pretty nice. No rude bouncers or anythin. It was a great night. Perfect way to end our vegas trip
Surprisingly, I did not like the venue. I say this, because I've heard great things about this place, so I was very disappointed to feel otherwise.. . So many stairs and the rooms were very small. In order to get to the first room, we climbed one too many flights of stairs (I think it was like...the 5th floor or something ridiculous like that). The hip hop room had a great DJ who spun everything from current top hip hop hits to classics that hit home. The dance floor was extremely tiny though! We had to climb another set of stairs to get to the main floor where Kaskade's set was. Unless you had a table, you are constantly standing and bumping into everyone. The main dance floor has bouncers who keep you moving through the club. They pick and choose who to let in to the main dance area in front of the DJ. if you aren't able to get in, you are forced to keep moving until you are pushed outside. Lucky for me, I was able to get into the middle with a few friends, but part of my group wasn't so lucky, so we got split up. When Kaskade came on, it was super fun, until it got way too crowded and everyone was just packed in like sardines. Didn't help that the people next to me were doing cocaine on their credit cards in the midst of everyone sweating and farting profusely on each other. After a good 30 minutes of jumping up and down, we decided to leave. To me, that wasn't worth $50 for the guys. I would choose a pool party over this nightclub any day. Then again, EDM isn't my cup of tea anyways.
Not our first time coming here, as we stay at the cosmo each time we're in vegas, but unfortunately, the service and discernment of the staff has dropped significantly since our earliest experiences. Lets start w/ the day party - 2 stars - came through on Friday July 4th after we all landed. First the foolishness at the door with the hardcore I.D.'ing and lines to get on lines, even though we were on the guestlists and we're a group of girls. Prejudice from other staff members of our own color, were giving us a hard time and power tripping. Once upstairs the asian bartender was a total turd, we ordered gummi bear shots from her, she misheard and gave us some minty shyt that tasted like scope, she had an attitude problem when we told her it was wrong and we wanted her to change them to what we ordered, as if WE did something wrong, cause its our fault that the music was too loud and she couldn't hear us? Ok, so then she goes and tattle tales on herself to management before we go and speak to them ourselves, cause she wanted to soften her own story by telling it herself and still wanted to charge us to change the shots, cause naturally someone shot it all since they're supposed to be shots. Duh. Anyways, we finally got our correct shots after some back and forth, but it was a total buzz kill to deal with her sourness, especially when the party was already dying down. We had started our day so happy and ready to party, they completely harassed us down to were we just left. Came back again Tuesday to kill time before our flights and it was such a dead zone. Had lobster tacos, they were ok, light, small, nothing too flavorful. Both times they played awful EDM, no house at least, no switching up, no classics, just super niche electronic shyt. Marquee dayclub staff and management is super weak, and you would think they would conduct themselves better with new, hipper, sexier competitors like Drais taking the majority of their crowd.. . As for the night club - 4 stars - we had a good time there last year, and a great time there again this year on a monday night after the 4th of july holiday weekend. Got through on the guestlist with no harassment this time. But also worth noting we got there really early, like 10-11ish. Was supposedly their industry night, we stayed in the boombox room with hip hop. Music and mixing was good, everyone was dancing, tons of groups of cool girls ready to have good clean dancey fun. We were some of the first to arrive, some sponsors got us tons of white gummibear shots so we were feeling nice again. Place got packed, music was great, Lebron James was in the building, things got good, cause we forced it up to be so. But originally the girl bartender was super nervous to make our normal drinks properly during the open bar because of "cameras". Same with a guy tender at another bar downstairs, and he was of course more rude about it. Management needs to empower and encourage their barstaff to apply discernment independently for situations, 3 hot ladies celebrating a birthday and bachelorette, shouldnt have to negotiate for well made drinks, especially at the given pricepoints. You would get so much more money giving people proper drinks, cause then theyre feeling buzzed and enjoying themselves and want to stay longer and spend more money. Stop being so effing cheap on the liqs and making your staff so scared and bitchy, or if the struggle is so real, dont have an open bar then. And your door shouldnt be armed to the tooth by assholes. They should have the good sense to let the party girls into to party. Lighten up marquee, you're really not that hot and you're losing your audience to other hotter, better staffed and better managed spots on the strip.
After hearing about Marquee from numerous people I decided I had to try it out for myself so on 4th July myself, my partner and his friend headed over to Cosmopolitan from our hotel to give it a spin. We had gone to Hakkasan the night before and, while ended up having a good night, were not looking forward to being treated like scum by the bouncers for not paying for bottle service. Our fears were unfounded it seems, when we arrive we were greeted warmly by the security staff, barely had to wait in line and were taken up to the club promptly. Once inside the bar staff were efficient and everyone seemed hellbent on having a great time!. . Marquee is great as you can go outside or in, have a gamble and also choose from a few different rooms so things never get boring. The music is great and the feature dancers are hot- nothing bad to say about this venue!
Rude, disrespectful and obnoxious. Will never come back here again. Don't waste your time or money.
We stayed at the Cosmo for a few days and one of them was on a Monday.  Marquee is open on Mondays.  We arrived around midnight and got in easily for free through the Hotel Guests line.  Big plus right there.  We stayed at Encore and did not get in for free to either XS or Tryst simply because we were hotel guests. (now we get in for free because we know one of their top servers personally). . I loved Marquee.  Not as good as XS or Tryst but better than Hakkasan at MGM in my opinion.  There are lots of areas to explore.  My only gripe is the terrible stairs.  I understand the need for stairs in a place like this but dress it up a bit!  It reminds me of stairs in an old high-school.. . Our favorite room was the BoomBox room - hip-hop and a lot of fun.  I did not get to see the Library or at least I don't remember lol.  Drinks are typical $20 each so pre-party to get your buzz on before coming to the club and prepare for a lot of walking.  If you don't have a table, there are very few places for you to check out the action unless you're lucky enough to get a spot on a wall.  Bouncers keep you moving in all directions.  Still even without a table I would come back to Marquee and plan to next time.
Haven't been to the day club so I can't say anything about that, but the night club isn't that fun because it's just soooo packed. There's literally no where to stand, and the workers will constantly tell you to move away from the isles. . . People were standing anywhere and everywhere they would fit. Lol it's just too packed to even have fun. They should really consider letting less people in. . . . Being outside is nicer because it's less crowded, but the music is inside.......
Came to Marquee for the first time with my girlfriends to celebrate my frends return from the navy and did not expect such rude and unnecessary behavior from their bouncers.. . We were on guestlist and waited over 3 hrs for any response but was rudely ignored even though we went up to them asking about the current status. When we were finally able to get one of their attentions they said itd be 20-30 more minutes after 30 min he says that the line is on hold and cant do anything about it. But he continued to let random people who werent in line through.. . I do not expect to ever stay at the Marquee after such an experience and you shouldnt either.
POOL: WAY too packed. MUSIC: WAYYY too loud. DJ: very, very sweaty but his music didn't suck. DANCERS: Impressive. We went to the day club and obviously this is where the talented dancers go to earn a living in vegas, not at strip or night clubs. WAITSTAFF: not bad for where they are forced to work BOUNCERS: d#$%s I saw them ask a guy with a white nose if he was doing coke then let him in anyway WHA?? They would not, however, let me in without mandating that i pay $30 to check my 13x9'' straw beach bag. Crazy? No, those are the priorities of the bouncers at a Vegas club. Oh and btw, we stayed at the Cosmo so passed the line and got in both days with no wait. We came on Friday 4th of July and Saturday. We got a cabana at the front of the pool. . . Overall: no intelligent person wants to go to a "day club." There is nothing to do except drink and grind like a farm animal. I consider it a crime that i was forced to waste 5 hours of my life here. Therefore, I give this club one star. If I could give it no stars I would.
Hands down the best club I've ever been to.  I was out with two friends, looking for something to do and randomly ended up here this past Friday.  It was after midnight and we were on our way to the Chandelier Bar for a cocktail and saw the HUGE line out in front of Marquee and figured it might be something good.  I talked to the door guy for a second and he escorted us past the line and the cashier to the elevator.  Score!!. . Being newbies, we explored a bit before picking our spot.  The outside area was gorgeous... swimming pools, palm trees, music, and an incredible view.  We found our way to the bar and ordered up some drinks.  The bartender came to us right away and was super friendly.  There was a bit of sticker shock on the prices, but she hooked it up strong.. . We enjoyed our drinks outside before heading in for the real show.... . Audien was playing.  Holy smokes it was good.  The sound system was incredible.  The light show was spectacular.  Beautiful go-go dancers.  And the music.... wow.  We danced our feet off until after 4:00am and the party was still going strong.  I was wishing for more comfortable shoes so I could keep dancing.. . I've seen some complaints on here about rude staff, but that couldn't be further from the truth for us.  We actually commented to each other about how polite and friendly everybody was.  Which is weird for a nightclub.  Guess we have lowered expectations coming from Atlanta.  lol.  But seriously, every staff member we encountered was very welcoming.. . And the crowd was amazing.  Very few amateurs.  They do a great job at filtering out the obvious d-bags at the door.. . I thought my clubbing days were just about over, but I think I'm just living in the wrong city.  Vegas, I'll be back!!!
Came here to see Kaskade on a Saturday night.  As expected, the place was popping and way over capacity.  Tickets were $55 and we waited over an hour to get in (a clear sign of over capacitance).  As soon as we got in, there was literally no room to stand.  The bouncers kept moving EVERYONE that was ANYWHERE (besides those who had table service) to "keep the flow of traffic" as one bouncer proclaimed.  The dance floor...don't even get me started.  It was so small and packed even tighter than a can of sardines!  I saw this one dude slip the bouncer guarding the dance floor a $20 to get in.  The bouncer lets him in, but the guy couldn't move 2 feet past the bouncer because it was so ridiculously packed.  What a waste of money.... . Word of advice - if you don't have table service, it's not really even worth coming here.. . P.S.  I forgot to mention that the visual effects (lights, CO2, sound) - all impeccably well balanced and thought of.  Definitely tops Hakkasan for sure.
I've been to Marquee for 5 times in 2.5 years and it's still my favorite club in Vegas. . . Marquee is my type of club. Hip Hop (downstairs) and EDM (main floor) music in separated rooms and playing real good music. The downside is that Hip Hop room was way too small, even the music was killing it and there were still a bunch of guys standing in the dance floor, holding their drinks and NOT DANCING. MOVE, PLEASE. There's a reason for the area called "Dance Floor", it's not "Stand Floor". It was super crowded every time we tried to squeeze into the dance floor. The past Saturday we got there very early and got a nice space dancing, but soon it was packed as usual. Even it's packed but I still love it.. . I was in the main floor (where the world-famous DJs performing) couple times and after a certain hour, you just can't make it into the dance floor. I saw people gave $$ to the security and made their way in. Last Saturday, we were able to get in from the right side to see Kaskade. People come and go, you just need to make your way into the dance floor and that's all. Cool effects, sexy dancers and the smoke thing made the audience scream.. . What I love about Marquee is that there is a huge open space at the pool area, and you can still see the DJ from the monitors. Bars are everywhere but I found it hard to get your drinks since all the bartenders are very busy. I visited here 5 times and still love it. I've been here in March, July, September. July is the most packed month if you are thinking to come here. Lots and lots of people and almost no where to stand or sit. March is a bit too chilly but September is perfect. Kaskade was playing last Saturday and it was super packed. It was probably the first time ever I experienced the full crowd. If you don't like to dance in the packed crowded (I mean, who does anyway), try to avoid holiday weekends.. . In Vegas, girls usually don't need to pay for covers as long as you found the right promoter :) I've never paid for getting into the club. The drinks were expensive. $20 for a Redbull Vodka, yikes. The crowd was awesome every time I visited. Very descent crowd I would say. I met a guy who claims he is Ryan Reynolds' cousin, they looked alike, he was like Ryan Reynods with beard. I didn't believe him anyway haha. . . Packed crowd, expensive drinks, guys standing in the dance floor and not dancing at all... yeah lots of cons but WHO CARES. I LOVE MARQUEE. The best night club in Vegas for sure. By the way, I visit on Saturdays and it never let me down.
Came here on a Saturday night thinking I was going to enjoy , as Kaskade was playing . Bought tickets online and the line for people with tickets was ridiculous we waited and waited and waited to get in. By the time I was at the door to get in it was a hour and 30min later by that time I knew the club was packed and sure enough we walk in the dance floor is CLOSED!! NO Tables!! So why let people in if you're at capacity and security kept on people to move along move along , ok? Move where?! The club is so small! They kept letting people in but with nowhere to go . Aside from that the dance floor is pretty small . And When we walked in we had to go down what looked like alley stairs to get inside the club smh that's horrible . The little I was able to see of Kaskade he was great
The vibe was more like Snoopy's Soak City than a Vegas day club.. . The music is good but they encourage splashing and horseplay. Might be fun for some but I personally prefer day clubs to be... well, more like a club. Also wasn't digging my eyes stinging from huge dudes splashing the entire pool.. . You're only allowed entry if fully and properly clothed. We were denied twice, first because I was in only a swim suit, and then because my boyfriend was wearing slippers. Of course we proceeded to strip down after entering anyway.
Quite a charade. A+ atmosphere w D- attitude. This place takes the 'club cool' to a new level. F this game - go to nine fine Irishmen, twice the fun, half the price, and none of the shenanigans of Marquee.
Don't blame the club for you not having a good time. Chances are you aren't doing it right if you have a bad time.. . -1 star for the stairs. I don't even wear heels and that sucks. I've been to the summit of kilimanjaro so if I'm complaining about the stairs that's gotta mean something.. . OK I lied.
Way too crowded and loud. The bouncers were super rude. 2 stars for having a great location. I think this club could be great if they limited the number of guests more.
Went for a Bachelorette party and it was too stuck up and not really a dance club. The elevators "did not go down" per the doorman so our exit was down 4 flights of stairs in heels! Not a good time.
It was a good night club, great music, and pretty good vibe but all that was overshadowed by how crowded it was!! There were people arguing with eachother, on two different occasions, after people pushed eachother! I don't think I would go back because of that and even though there were two dance floors it still didn't allow space for everyone ....
Review for the day club.  First and foremost, make sure you call and make reservations for day beds in advance.  If you try to do it at the door, you will most certainly run into a higher table minimum.  We did it at the door, 3 of us with a minimum of 1000, the table next to us did it in advance, 5 of them with a 500 minimum.    If u end up not getting ur own area, then general admission is only 30 bux, but u end up being a douche just standing around, or in the over crowded pool.. . One you arrive, the waitress is very nice and accommodating, taking ur initial order.  Then they come back with whatever u got and your minimum bill with tax and tip already added for you to sign.  You can imagine since tip is already added, and you have signed, that service will suck after.  You're right!  The waitress afterwards is literally no where to be found.   We asked 10 different people for things over the course of our time there, service was horrendous. . . The music is pretty amazing.  The people look great and are very friendly, probably bc everyone is dancing and drinking.  The pool gets totally packed.  The water looked NASTY, it had a cloudy appearance to it that made it look very unsanitary.  . . It is a fun party, just remember, book in advance and expect the worst service of your life.  The good music and the fun good looking ppl make up for all the bad.
This is a go to for me. I missed Marquee my last visit and I regret it. Dayclub is my fave. It's small but always has a good feel. It's a bit exclusive as most Vegas clubs would be so show up with some sexy people or extra tips to get in. They usually have the entrance fenced and you gotta approach security because they will act like they don't see you. . . Nightclub is pretty cool too. Stairs suck when all floors are open but the variety is well worth it. I've had nothing but good times in this place! It's in the Cosmo so no surprise that it's beautiful!
Great club but having Darren at the elevator cuss and yell because he wouldn't let me on the elevator with my friends is a mood killer. I've worked in the industry for years and have never seen such unnecessary hostility.
