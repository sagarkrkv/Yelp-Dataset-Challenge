This was my first time staying at the Mirage.  I have stayed at A LOT of hotels in Vegas. This hotel is pretty good. It's not the Wynn or Palazzo, but my room was nice, updated and comfortable. .     The casino is good, never saw table minimums below $10. You can find a good number of 25 cent slots which I like..      I did not find the restaurants very appealing and there is no good breakfast place. They have a buffet, I didn't try it. Instead we walked across the street to the grand lux at the Palazzo. We picked up a sandwich at the deli place. I'm gonna give it 1 star. $18 and it was only turkey and bread, that's it... Not cool..     The pool is good. I like the water fall, it's a great place to stay cool. You can get big $20 slushy drinks with hardly any booze at the dolphin bar. It's shady though with 3 big flat screens if you want to see a game..     Let's see. No real shopping, unless it's something you forgot. Good thing is the Caesar shops is right next door.  All in all I would say its a great hotel for families and people on a budget.
Love the rooms!!
Took my daughter and her best friend here for her 21st birthday. We all had an awesome time.. . Ate at BLT burger twice, and saw Cirque du Soleil - Love - all were amazing. Staff was pleasant and the room was clean and comfortable.. . However, I had to remove two stars because the first night we arrived, instead of the 2 queen bed room we reserved, we were put in a 1 king. They moved us the next day, but it was a hassle, I had to call twice for the rollaway, and they offered nothing to make up for what was their mistake.. . Although I enjoyed the trip, that was a bit of a bummer, and will lead me to look at other options the next time we visit.
ehh for the price i think this place is okay, and doable its not the most luxurious but its better than monte carlo. . theres some scuffs on the wall and stuff which takes away from the look but its still good! i recommend this if your going to vegas on a budget, if you got the cash then go to BELLAGIO!!!
I just had the most racist experience toward my wife and I by a cocktail waitress while we were at the mirage casino in Las Vegas 7/7/2014 playing slots.You would believe in this day and age America would have evolved, but instead it only got worst.We sat there for at least a hour while this blonde waitress asked and served everyone around us and didn't even have the decency to look our way  luckily we won a couple of hundred but we will never gamble there again. I'm an African American hard working man who wants to be treated equally in the U.S or where ever I go...
Love the Mirage!!". . Other than a mysterious unexpected $9 room service delivery fee above the $100 we paid for cold eggs benny,toast and potatoes {Including $20 tip in cash},Or this review would have been 5 solid stars, everything was superb! Great room, polite housekeeping staff, wonderful restaurants! Pool was spectacular as always. Pristine property. Thanks Mirage!!
Very pretty entrances with waterfalls, rocks, and greenery. The place looks pretty average and kind of gave me that 90's feel. It was pretty nice walking by the glass dome. Probably not my top choice for resorts.
Nice interior.  I didn't stay here but we came by for the World Cup Finals match between Germany and Argentina.  They had a $35 all you can eat/drink promotional going on.  Unlimited Jack and Coke, beer, AND FOOD??  Ridiculous!!!
Stayed from 6-27 to 7-2 2014. Have stayed many times and it has always been GREAT! Love this place. We are poker players and we really like the feel of the poker room. The rooms are top notch as always. Only thing I didn't really like was the room service. took 1 1/2 hours to get 1 item. but oh well. Will be back for sure! I miss it already
We used to go all the time because we had such good experiences. Last two times have been awful. Rude staff- they don't care about you or your experience.
We had a great stay at the Mirage. There were four of us (we brought a 10 year old and 1 year old) and we weren't looking to spend too much...we got a really good deal and decided to book a quick trip! Probably wouldn't return as there's so many other options in Vegas for just a few dollars more a night.. . Pros:. Great price. Good location on the strip. Well designed rooms with lots of floor space. Beautiful pool with lots of chairs. . Cons:. Room wasn't well cleaned at checkin. Bathroom had mold/dirt in the grout and the tub didn't drain, so gross. Pool only open 8am-8pm in the summer. Stuffy/hot rooms, the hallway was about 10 degrees cooler than our room. Walk from the car to the room was crazy, the least direct way to get from Point A to B. Not many casual dining options
Previous stay here was great about 3 years ago.  This time our room card key didn't work...had to replace them twice.  We found that housekeeping didn't shut our door completely when we returned from breakfast.  Unacceptable.  We were awaken 3/4 nights that we stayed by different guests every night talking so loudly in hall between 2-6 a.m.  Lady across hallway was not pleased either, so she opened her door and told them to keep it down.  One night someone tried jamming their card key in our door until my husband yelled for them to stop.  Won't stay at this hotel again.
Wow! Really? a store called Kardashian Khaos....guess who owns this store lol lol they have everything from tshirts, playing cards, beach towels, fans witheach Kardashian face, even the Mom Kris has a shirt that says "Kris is my fav"!  Soooooo interesting. For Kim to have done a sex tape for stardom, she sure has milked her career for everything it's worth! Smh. . Also at 11am the Mirage has something called Bare where I guess you can be in the pool area topless? Vegas is something else! Talk about Sin City!
Not bad for the price you pay. Spacious rooms, beds, clean, quick service. I just hate that all their toiletries smell like men's cologne.
Just got back today from our SECOND stay at this lovely hotel.  I will admit I was shocked how we were UPGRADED for FREE to a petite Suite. I'm very grateful for myVEGAS slots (facebook & mobile game).  I earned our room and I've got a ton of loyalty points. I just wish you could redeem the room rate more than once.. If you're a couple it's not so bad. I play on the boyfriend's account to earn double the rewards. You're allowed up to 3 redeems in a rolling 30 day period.. . I have to mention I'm a local & I did book this stay just to get away from the same crap different day feeling. I don't stay for more than one night. We've never had maid service. I've heard many horror stories so PLEASE FOLKS. Use the safes in the rooms! I was thoroughly pleased with our last visit May 8th 2014, our anniversary.. . I booked it this time I couldn't believe the value I got. $59 plus the 12% resort fee & another 12% room tax.  Plus the 25 dollar resort fee. Our last visit was had a basic room with a king bed. I thought the room was beautiful. This time we were right at the elevator. I was amazed when we saw our room number as we excited the elevator. I was ecstatic. My eyes light up when we opened the doors, I guess I don't get out much. It had his & her's bathrooms. A super comfy bed just like the last room. The view was of the backside of the building with a mountain view. I thought it was great. You could see palace station & the stripper bars. We turned off the lights at night in the room to check out the view.. . What I'm upset about is this morning our check out was LOVELY. George the bell man was so polite & happy to know we were there for a daycation. We went to the M life desk because the last time we stayed they had comped one of our meals each. One for breakfast, one for dinner. on top of the myVEGAS rewards I had loaded to our account. So the meals were basically free. We went this time & the lady at M life was miserable & could of cared less. She was complaining about how she had been up since 7 am after we mentioned we were exhausted from staying up until 4 AM hoping we had comps for breakfast. She said, "NO, sorry. Just $4 in express comps".  My boyfriend replied, "That's funny, wonder WHY they comped us the last time we stayed?", we decided it was time to check out. The Check out was not has memorable as our last. The girl hid her name tag, behind her hair. Didn't ask us how we were or how was our stay here, no concern.. . Then for the bell guy down at the main valet.. We handed him the ticket. He told us to go to valet, he met us there & and soon as he dropped our stuff off he started mumbling on under his breath. So then we finally got the car, valet comes roaring up in our new car that's barely a month old, like a bat out of hell. He misses his coworker that wasn't paying attention pulls the car around the car parked in valet & stops. Boyfriend went to reach in his wallet for a tip & he says to my boyfriend, "Don't worry about it, I don't need it". Not sure if he was referring to the tip or the valet slip.  He could of been less of a miserable person. We didn't even bother giving him a hard time about the car. All the valets tell us they love the car. Maybe he was just having a good day & somebody tipped big. We tip fair.. . I don't understand. Our anniversary was nice & we were treated so highly. Today everybody had a stick up their butts. What the heck just happened? I'm confused. Our room was great but now I'm torn between giving this place an, "A-OK" and a "YAY! I'm a fan."  I'm a fan of the rooms but the way we were treated was inexcusable. From M life desk, to check out, to bell guy to the valet.. . A smile & a friendly greeting goes a long way. I always smile when I'm a guest. I don't want to be the memorable unpleasant guest.  I'll give them another try next year, since I'm so on the fence. Definitely was not, "As good as it gets". Not this time. Last time they waved our fees & this time we paid...... oh well. Very disappointed. The only thing I was pleased with, we managed to keep our Pearl Status by taking this trip.  Make sure you always use your player's card. You earn points at all the MGM properties. You earn more from shows than you do gambling. Sign up is free at M life desk.
We had an awesome stay here. It's a pretty moderately priced hotel and I really like the theme of it. The rooms are nice and so is the casino and rest of the hotel. . . The staff was nice upon check in and they upgraded us to a strip view room! Woo! Everyone loves getting upgrades. Check in was quick and there was no line. We were there before check in time, so they said they would text us when our room was ready which we thought was cool. But we never got the text! Around 2/3 we called the hotel and asked if our room was ready and they said it was and they were sorry we didn't get the text. So I'm not sure if that texting thing happens all the time or if it was just with us. But either way we weren't too happy with that. . . The rooms are nice. I love the headboard on the bed and I love the theme! The bed was super comfortable and I loved the pillows. The bathroom was your typical hotel bathroom. It wasn't huge but it was a decent size. There was only two of us staying in the room, so we didn't have too much to worry about anyway with placing things in the bathroom. . . Love the garden. It's nice to walk through and it's a nice touch to have some green in the hotel. I didn't really gamble but the casino was pretty big. It took a while to walk to the elevators for our rooms. . . I'd recommend trying this hotel out. It's nice and pretty decent priced.
A beautiful hotel.  It lobby is serene and provides immediate relief when you first walk in to check in after a long drive or flight to Vegas.  It has a free tram connecting to Treasure Island.
Homies and I stayed Mirage for the weekend. We had options between, Caesars or Mirage and decided to stay here because we could get to 1 Oak quicker and better yet we got in for FREE! Just showed our hotel keys and got the night started! . . The Casino isn't that bad as well! Plenty of tables high and low and tons of slots spread throughout the floor. As well as some places to eat & even a starbucks! As to our rooms, it was very comfy, I remember our two queen beds were suffice for four grown ass men! . . Next time i'm in Vegas, i wouldn't mind staying here again fosho! GLM Approves! plus I won $56 off the penny slots and turned $60 bucks into $250 on the BJ tables :)
just returned from my stay this weekend. i thought the hotel was very unorganized. i got locked out of my room 'cause the the night lock/ hatch got stuck on the door without anyone being in the room. i called the front desk all day to get my luggage out of my room which had to be done asap since they gave me the wrong rooms the night before (i booked 2) and i had to switch rooms. they didn't understand what the problem was with the hatch and assumed i couldn't get in my room 'cause i already approved the room switch however the key still worked but the hatch was obviously not letting the door open all the way. even room service employee was trying to figure out what was up with my room door and how the the hatch was on. she said i should call the front desk 'cause she had to clean it. when i finally got through to the front desk for some reason instead of sending maintenance they sent security. finally i saw a maintenance man walking the hallway and told him the problem and he fixed it in seconds. even checked the room and said it was probably haunted. and the room switches, i waited all day for them. they kept saying theyll be ready in an hour, then half an hour, then half an hour later they would be ready in another half hour. i basically just wasted my whole friday on room switches and waiting for someone to fix my room door so i can collect my stuff. it was kinda disappointing because i've stayed here before and really liked my experience. don't think ill return to this hotel. i have had way better experiences at other mlife hotels. . . The rooms were clean and there was a lot to do within the casino during my stay. in addition, my previous experience was really good which is why i decided to give 3 stars. I don't know why I was having so much bad luck this time around.
This review is for the villas and lanais in rear of casino. Each has a private swimming pool in your private backyard. They are massive. You enter from the casino in an unmarked door to a serene hallway. Butlers. Private all powerful concierges. Every detail. While the Aria may be new and offer the Crystals for shopping and Barmasa and Ceasar's may have the Forum Shoppes and Nobu...this is the true Vegas sweet life. Tables of all limits. Accessible. Fun restaurants. Lots of action. Love this place.
Cravings was excellent ! One of the best buffets in Vegas hands down. Prime Rib was melt in your mouth , roasted turkey and gravy delish! The Asian selections were vast and all very tasty. The buffet is set up with each station a different cuisine. Bbq, carving station, Asian, Italian, etc AND you get all you can drink beer and wine for $30! I will be back for sure
We love the mirage...our first stay was the best because we got a tower suite and it was the best. This time we got an upgraded king room and it was nice just a little pricy for what it was. I upgraded for a Jacuzzi tub but got a soak tub and I wish they had a fridge so that you can take your own beverages.We will come back again tho.
