My rental car was stolen from valet! . . Hard to review... I've stayed here multiple times and have enjoyed my stay. The rooms aren't anything special but the price reflects that... You get what you pay for and the rooms have everything you would need and I like the low price point. However, I would NOT stay in the pyramid and think pyramid vs tower is like a different hotel. Totally worth the $20 upgrade. The rooms are dark whichI didn't like and maids came by before 9am! On the end of strip and had to take 5 min cabs to get to Paris, Mirage, etc.. . This last stay we were there for one night. Valet my rental car at 11:15p. In the morning I realized my ticket had been misplaced and went down to valet desk to get car. Car was not in valet. After hours of looking for the vehicle it was deemed stolen. They had no information for me- did someone else claim my car? Did they give the car to the wrong person? Was it taken when I dropped it off .  (it was not immediately parked)? . . Filed reports with Luxor, car rental company and police. Luxor lacked a sense of urgency in the matter and kept asking if I was sure I parked it at that valet and at that hotel. Despite my insistence (and coworker that was with me the whole time) security searched the other valet lot as well as Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. Surprise- wasn't there because that's not where I parked. They even had me call the rental company to confirm the car was white.... . Luxor paid my cab fare to airport. After filing reports went to lunch then I swung back through valet to see check in once more before leaving for airport. Valet manager was much nicer this time and got the hotel manager involved. She was very nice and comped my stay. . . Whole thing was a nightmare and lost my only 'vacation' day after working at Red Rock all weekend. Luxor has cameras on valet but will not provide any information on surveillance videos, said I 'would need a subpoena'. Had very expensive sunglasses in car and doubt I will see them again.
Great hotel. The staff is really helpful and nice. The decor is beautiful and my room had a wonderful view.
Stayed here 6/26 to 6/29 and LOVED it. Will be staying here from now on. We booked a pyramid room but at check in was upgraded to a tower room since we were getting married and what a beautiful room and view. Huge bath tub with seperate shower. King bed with 8 pillows. Was very comfortable like mine at home. HDTV flat screen tv with very clear resolution. Staff was so accommodating and friendly. I loved the luxor for a first time staying there and will be staying again in a couple months.
The beds are comfortable , the bathroom is nice the TV is HD and flat screen BUT there is no freakin' Wi-Fi !!!! I've been in small communities that have friggin Wi-Fi in their hotels. Due to that reason I won't be staying at the Luxor if I come back to Vegas. It's too bad I didn't remember to check about Wi-Fi before booking here on Expedia. The staff are nice though if that's what you're looking for. If I come back I'll be asking if they have Wi-Fi and if the answer is no I'll be staying somewhere else.
Pyramid suite: bathtub full of dirty towels and filthy water when I checked in. 2 1/2 for fresh towels. They charge for roll out beds. Rough crowd. It's like Laughlin or a Swapmeet in LA.... Gross all around. Food court is terrible. Cris Angel sucked... This is just the first day. Oh BTW Forget about drinks IF you're gambling, 5 hours of play at $25 a hand and received one warm bud light. Thanks Luxor!!!!! You suck!!!
It was my first time in Vegas and the Luxor was pretty cool. The staff was supper friendly and quick at what they do. The bathrooms are a little outdated with weird wall paper and little pyramid shapes to them. The rooms are pretty quiet, you can't hear your neighbor. The pool looked cloudy and there were too many people in the pool for my comfort level so I did not even bother. The view from the 9th floor to the atrium was amazing and the view from our pyramid room was pretty nice facing Mandalay bay and the airport. . The reason why the elevator shakes a lot is because the elevator is traveling across the pyramid. Its not like a typical elevator that goes up and down, its traveling diagonally. . The luxor should take better care of the outside of the pyramid by cleaning the windows because it looks a little dusty. The hotel has a great design to it and its a shame to see it look shabby. The beam on top of the pyramid is pretty impressive. I suggest they should put light beams out of sphinx eyes that would be cool to see. Overall its a good place to stay on a budget in vegas. . My final opinion of vegas overall I discovered that most of the vegas hotels smell like sewer not just the Luxor.
I always wanted to stay here, as I am a sucker for a gimmick and the fact that it is a giant pyramid completely sold me. The hotel is fine, clean enough, but it was nothing special and the lack of wifi in the rooms was pretty bad. I mean what hotel does not have wifi as an option these days?. Not a bad choice for the money, as it is a relatively cheap hotel, but just not a great hotel.
Room was clean.  Hotel needs to be renovated.  Food was too over priced.  Hotel staff was friendly.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay.
Not a fan of the Luxor, It has become somewhat run down, and the service and hospitality on my last visit was terrible.  Unfortunately even after trying to resolve several issues with the management, nothing was offered me despite being a mlife and rapid reward customer to compensate for the lack of fulfillment of the promises made in the all inclusive show, and the fees not disclosed until after purchase, also the run around you get when you try to get help. also the timeshare people in the lobby that are dressed just like the other employees are very aggressive compared to other hotels on the strip.  Small Dirty room, poor air quality, slow cleaning service. not a good time for me.  Maby if I was 21 and just needed a place to crash cheaply, but there are so many better deals in nicer hotels available. Very dated, and the WiFi was horrible. Had to go out into the hallway to get reception even though they had a router in the room dangling in the closet.
We had fun, we found special rate online, which was great deal in strip.  Our room inside of the pyramid was OK but I was not comfortable the elevator moves side way...  We went pool, it was nothing special feature.
I did not like Vegas. I will start the review by saying that, because as my Vegas experience was bad naturally I would feel similar about my accommodation. . . But to start, I did not like the hotel much it was in dire need of a refurbishment and was clearly showing it's age. The staff were friendly I will give them that but getting a hold of them was almost impossible. . . The bed was very uncomfortable, I could hardly sleep at all on them and when i did it was only because the noise from downstairs has quietened down a little.. . Overall i did not like the hotel and will not stay again. . . (I know this review is biased from my stay in vegas...so please take what i say with a pinch of salt)
As a local, it is imperative to find a cheap way to have a good time in Vegas. Most of the time, I find Vegas to be overpriced, which is obviously due to the influx of tourists here from other places. My boyfriend and I decided to do a staycation, and we chose Luxor because of its good price as an online deal. When we went to check in,  Marilyn, the lady at the front desk, made fluid conversation and upgraded us to a phenomenal room with a later check-in time because we were locals. We paid $50 for a suite with a living room, kitchen, humongous bathroom,  a view of the pool, and King size bed. We were also given a coupon book that helped us enjoy our stay even more-- $20 off Jabbawockeez tickets with a free t-shirt. The restaurants were moderately priced, and we were in a prime location of walking distance between the Mandalay Bay, Excalibur, and New York New York.. All in all, we had a wonderful time and will definitely be returning.
We stated for two nights in the west tower.  It was quiet and clean.  The employees were all friendly and helpful.  The only minor annoyance was the constant hawking of the time-share people.  It felt like every time we went down to the casino we had to run the gauntlet.  After three days, it really got old.  If not for this, the hotel would have gotten 4 stars.
We stayed at the Luxor in one of their Spa Suites.. . The Spa Suites are on the corners of the hotel's pyramid, and they feature a sleeping area with queen beds, and a large sitting area with a Spa / Hot Tub situated closer to the window for a wonderful view of the LV skyline and strip, or the LV mountains (depending on where you are facing).. . I will say that the Luxor may not be as elegantly decorated as the Bellagio, but these rooms, their size and floor plan; as well as, its amenities are well worth the price. We paid $400/night for our room, and it was definitely worth it.. . The inclinators (instead of elevators) are a nice and memorable touch to the overall experience.. . And since the hotel had a monorail station within, it made traveling down the strip simple and effortless. Instead of fighting the crowds on the street, we just hopped hotels through the stip using the monorail. Now, it does get crowded in there during the busy hours, but it certainly is a welcome change to the morass of the crowds and traffic on the strip.. . If you're in LV, and want to experience the Suite life, I would highly recommend you try one of these Suites before you plunk down $$$/night elsewhere.
We stayed at the Luxor, we were charged a  daily resort fee of just $22.40 (tax inclusive) per day. There is only wi fi in "public areas" 1/4 swimming pools is for "paid access only" 1/4 is closed without lifeguards. So the remaining two pools were very crowded. Parking is very far from any of the rooms. Prepare to walk at least a mile to your room from any parking lot. There are people in the lobby constantly bothering and badgering you to go see time share presentations. It was not a relaxing pleasant stay. I wont stay here again.
My friend had his wallet stolen by the maids who came into his room to clean it. He complained in person and even emailed after but luxor refuses to take any actions to compensate him. He had $2000 stolen. AVOID AT ALL COST!
Older but comfy.  Great for the you get crowd.be sure to eat at the Taco & Tequila bar!
I usually have a great time in Las Vegas, but my last trip was abysmial. Needless to say most of my issues had to do with the service and helpfulness of the staff at the Luxor. Most of them were unhelpful or incompetent. Some of the things I had to deal with were unexpected from a major Vegas hotel. . . I was ready to give this a 2 star rating, but Mike at the check in counter was the shining gem in a box full of coal. He took the time to listen to my issues and offered me some compensation for the troubles I had. If more of the staff was like Mike then I would comeback to the Luxor more often. He is the reason I bumped up my rating to 3 stars. Please keep him around for a long time. Thank you Mike.
I wasn't expecting too much here since I normally stay at the Palazzo.  I was at Circus Circus Reno about 2 weeks before so I was ready for the decent but ok Casino hotels.  I'm a big fan of the Egyptian theme and the high ceiling (it's a freaking pyramid).  The big let downs are the shaky elevator that felt like the Tower of Terror for Disneyland's California Adventure in Burbank, CA and the weak air conditioning that barely cools down the room.  I'm on the 21st floor and I think I received the morning sunrise.  When I turn my AC on high and leave it that way until 8pm at night, I expect a cool room.  Unfortunately, it felt the same as the morning.  I'm always sticky and sweaty in the room so it's hard to sleep in that state.  I guess it's a ruse from the Casino to make me leave the room to gamble more.
This was our second time staying here and this time we got a room on the 29th floor of the pryamid and can i say thqat i do not feel safe in those elevators, plus they dont help if your drunk or not feeling good either.   When we checked into the room we found a porn cd in between the sheets.  Gross!!!. This casino seemed alot more dirty than before in the rooms and the casino floor itself.
I booked two Queen rooms last minute for my mothers birthday and We All Loved our stay! The staff was extremely helpful, efficient, and on top of the sh**. . . The casino-gambling area was very clean, well organized, easy to get from point A to B. I didn't feel like I was in a cigarette box and I didn't feel like I was huffing "air freshener fumes" as I have at other major hotels in Vegas. . . my poolside experience was great, wasn't overrun with kids and not too much of a crazy party scene. It was just right! and well maintained. . . Our rooms were spacious and clean. Unfortunately the room my Bf and I had  didn't have a pretty view, we saw ugly grey flat rooftop between our room and the pyramid but at least we got to admire the pyramid from our windows and not be disturbed by the sun in the morning. I would've given the Luxor a 5 star rating, but the shower was very disappointing. The shower head felt like it barely worked. it sprayed out water as if you held a hose and blocked part of it with your thumb..The water pressure was very weak. But it had excellent temperature control and the layout was nice and the bathtub was lovely. . . House Keeping at the Luxor is amazing. They are The Bomb! they promptly brought us extra towels when I called and asked for some. And when My bf and I left to the pool, they folded all three shirts my bf had left on the ground and put them on the bed. sooo nice :). . Overall I really enjoyed my stay at The Luxor and am looking forward to my next vegas trip with them.
I stayed at this hotel using a priceline deal which was awesome. $20/night, plus the additional $20 per night because of resort fees meant that I got to stay on the strip for $40/night. Had I paid more than that, my review would probably be lower. The hotel only has 1 24 hour restaurant and it is basically just sandwiches. The room was decent in size, seemed clean, and had a view of Mandalay bay hotel.. . The pool was packed during the day and closed at night. I wanted to go swimming at night! . . The worst part of this hotel is that it was such a trek to the room because of the shape of the hotel. If you are in the corner, you are crazy far from elevator and then it takes forever to find an elevator with room to go down. Once you are in the parking lot or ready to leave you better hope you didn't forget something in the room!. . Best part? Really nice woman who checked me in and Luxor shaped bar soap!. . I would stay here again for this price, but wouldn't pay a whole lot more (depending on season I guess).
Not clean. Literally Circus Circus and Motel 6 are giving them a run for their money. Dirty floors, comforters filthy, holes in furniture (not kidding). It's unfortunate. If you want a nice hotel to stay in, stay away from Luxor.
"One Of My Least Favorite". I generally aim for the more upscale casino's to not only gamble at but to also stay inside the hotel as well. I find these type of low budget casinos to be a bit past outdated and I guess for anybody who is on a budget that likes ancient egyptian theme's should opt for the Luxor!
I very much enjoyed my stay at the Luxor - it's a stunning hotel!
Love it here! Stay in the west tower!  They have bigger rooms and better views. Week day rate was 39.00 can't complain. The Luxor connects to Mandalay bay.. Your MGM card works at all MGM hotels. Try citizens for grub if you like steak it was the bomb! Better than the pricy stake house. Had a awesome time and the massage at the spa was heaven!
It's the Summer of 2014 and we're here for a conference 5d/4n. The conference set up was 1st class and the food was excellent each day. . This was our 1st time staying in an actual hotel property in Vegas. We normally utilize one of our timeshares when we're here. I must say the Luxor was nice. We had a standard king in the West tower. Good news is that there were no slanted ceilings on this side and the music from the pool didn't go past 8p. Bad news is that I would not have liked this side if I were on a normal vacation in case I wanted to sleep late during the day. The music would have been annoying. Also liked the connections the Luxor has to the Mandalay and Excalibur casinos.  It is a little walk to catch the Deuces bus but heck you're in Vegas. The people watching along the way is worth it!
We went to the lux our hotel for our 7 year anniversary! It was our first time staying at this hotel & I have to say we had an amazing extraordinary experience. We checked in at the VIP Mlife area and the person helping us his name was ALEX. Best customer service ever from Alex he gave us an upgrade with no questions asked and made sure that we were properly taking care of the whole time we were there. We had a wonderful time we were for 4 days, the food and the restaurants were yummy and even our room service was great.
I stayed at the Luxor with my family july 20-21 . . Pros - nice room service was good room was ok u get what u payed for . . Cons- pool was too outdated . Room was outdated , elevator ride was scary and the time share people are like hound dogs . . So we arrived sun about 1030 did not even check in and we got tricked by some lady stating that we can get tickets for cheap for some shows granted I had kids with me so discounted tickets sounded good so I ended up paying $70 dollars for supposedly a tour of Las Vegas and tickets for kings night court  plus free brunch and dinner so I agreed to it did not know it was a time share guy said to meet him down in the casino to take us to the tram so we did and we ended up in time share bull shit the lady that was supposed to be our tour guide was latterly on her night gown I told her that I did not want to buy a time share not interested and then she started to threaten me saying that I was gonna wait for my tickets that I had already paid for for 2 hrs bitch got me twisted so I told her she was gonna go get my money and ima get out of here she called security and told security that I caked her a bitch so I waisted my time for3 hrs for something other them what I was told do not get tricked by these people they do not give u anything for free they just waste ur time so I was so upset that I waisted half my day listening to some lady talk some bull shit they try to force u to buy but it's not legit Luxor should do away with that other then that room was clean pool was ok not anything great and my husband lost his credit cards he called and no answer spenders money stay somewhere else
Our stay at the Luxor was fantastic! Cozy beds, clean bathroom...pretty much all you need for a weekend in Vegas. Only wish our room had a fridge!
My experience at Luxor was pretty OK. My biggest complaints are the rooms lacking wifi and the Luxor needing renovations. Everything is getting pretty dated.  Our room wasn't very clean but the beds and pillows are soft. The view was amazing I do have to admit I love the luxor for the views.I felt like the location was convenient since it was kind of close to the airport. Also since Luxor was on the strip we often just took the tram to the other hotels. I love the decor of Luxor the Egyptians feel was pretty nice. The pool was ok but nothing really special. I booked my hotel with a $20 drink &food coupon and I used that for alcohol (awesome deal ) Also if you I need a food court that's open 24 hours Luxor has one!
At first I was super pumped to stay at the Luxor Hotel. My wife and I got one of those all inclusive packages that gave is tickets to the exhibits and Kriss Angel with buffet entry. It really wasn't a bad deal considering how much the cost was without bundling everything. . . The staff there was awesome from the valet down to the bell service. The hotel itself was about a subpar for the money we spent on it. We took the rumbly elevator to the 16th floor and had to make the trek to the other side of the pyramid to get to our room. We were thankful that the Sherpa of the hotel, the bell service was there to taxi our bags to our room. . . The air conditioner in the room was loud and pointed to the hot slanted window of the pyramid, rendering the rest of the room to feel like a sweat lodge. The bathroom was a good size; however there was no tub but only a shower. The shower head felt like a pressure washer and would take a layer or two of skin off after bathing. I guess it's to get the cigarette smell off from the casino. . . The buffet at the Luxor was meek and bland; I suggest journeying over to the Excalibur to hit their buffet. The buffet there seemed fresher and had more variety.. The pool was overcrowded and only 3ft deep in all areas, with plenty of cigarette butt sightings. . . Overall I had a pretty good time with the all inclusive package with the Luxor. There was just some minor things that I wish that the staff at the Luxor would improve on like, the quality/variety of food at the buffet, better air conditioning in the rooms, and some more elevators.
It's been awhile since I've been to Las Vegas and whew is it HOT!  Waking up to 84 degrees at 7 am is unusual to me. Lol.  It has also been quite a long time since I last stayed at the Luxor but it isn't too bad sooo far.   I am here for a conference and the food is wonderful!  The workers were also great and attentive. The only thing I am disappointed in is the condition of the rooms, but hey what do I expect from a hotel that's one of the first hotels on the very end of the strip way back when.?  Otherwise, I would stay here again considering the price. :-)
I had the worst experience checking into a hotel. I arrived to check-in around 11pm after a night of hanging out around Vegas. I had booked a double queen bedroom hotel room and got my keys to a room all the way on the other end of the casino. So far I would've rated the place a 3 or 4 stars because it is a bit old for a casino hotel on the Strip, but the staff felt nice and a lot of people seem to be enjoying themselves. . . As I got to the room the keys would not work! I had to walk all the way back to the check-in and the staff told me he had given me a room that was already occupied, he then changed the room to the one next door (so I would not be lost). My girlfriend had to remind the staff to re-program the keys to the new room. After the staff assured me everything would be OKAY now I walk back to the room to find out it is a 1 king size bed room and not the double queen size bed room I had reserved. So I had to walk all the way back to the check-in again. When I ask the staff that I had order a double queen bed room he told me that it was more like a request but the type of room is not guaranteed! I have never heard that before! After arguing for a bit they agreed to provide a roller-bed for free. After another walk back to the room I found a big wet spot on the floor, by then I wasn't going to walk back and decided to call it a night. The room was pretty big but it was offset by the tilted walls, makes the room feel odd. Normally I would've probably given the hotel 2-3 stars.
The only good thing about this hotel is the really awesome Titanic Exhibit, and T & T tacos the resteraunt located inside. I really wish I would have taken a picture of our Pyramid suite room.. Let's just say busted in walls, popcorn walls, missing pieces off of the furniture. Very outdated, with a very dirty feel. The beds are very soft and comfy.. But the room really sucks. The hotel needs desperately to be remodeled, and probably a thorough inspection done as we'll, it doesn't really seem safe. In it's day it was probably a really awesome hotel, but now.. It's not. Half of the resteraunts suck ass.. Besides T&T. The elevators shake vigorously on your way up because it's coming up at an angle due to the pyramid shape & the whole top half of the pyramid upstairs was closed and blacked out. Sort of creepy feel in the hall ways. Will never come back and don't recommend this hotel if your staying in Vegas.. Stay somewhere else. That doesn't have holes in the walls in your suite ;)
I stayed at Luxor for a trade show, not out of desire or fun. In case you didn't know, Luxor, Excalibur, and Mandalay Bay are all MGM properties, and Mandalay Bay is the only thing they got mostly right. My stay at Luxor began around 4:00 PM Monday and after hauling our bags through the casino corridors, we arrived at a frenzied check-in line. Of course, it was an optical illusion; the line was mostly groups of families checking in at once, so it went pretty fast.. . We took the Wonka-vator to the 12th floor of the pyramid, found our room, and unpacked. The room was clean, included the necessary soaps, lotions, and towels, and had a working AC. Unfortunately, the alarm clock was 20 minutes slow. For shame, Luxor!. . I had great cell reception with Verizon in this hotel.. . A major problem upon venturing outside the room... timeshare recruiters. These people look like casino security, but if they're not wearing a utility belt, avoid them! These people will catcall you over and ask where you're from, etc. Then all of a sudden, you're at a recruitment desk getting the scripted pitch.. . Here's a hint: give them two thumbs-up and they'll leave you alone. (It tells them you've heard it already.) Honestly, just say, "No thank you," and WALK if they don't let up. Yes, it's rude, but Luxor is beyond rude in the first place.. . Monday I dined at the Backstage Deli which is somewhere in the southwest corner of the casino. Cobb salad: EXCELLENT.. . Tuesday I purchased an all-day buffet wristband which works at Luxor "MORE" and Excalibur buffets. I can't say either buffet is better, but I wasn't disappointed by either.. . The biggest annoyance was the early pool closing at 8:00 PM. I don't gamble, I'm white, I don't go in the sun. I want to enjoy the pool at night. What the hell? Oh, and your housekeeping/roomservers need to be more observant because someone's leftover dishes were in my hallway for most of the day. That's sloppy.. . Trust me, Luxor. I'm used to RUDE customers, but the customer service part of your hotel needs improvement. Do away with the timeshare recruiters, expand pool hours, and improve your housekeeping. I, a customer, ACTUALLY may return for next year's lodging....
I stayed here before in the tower rooms.. . This time I stayed in the pyramid suite. Absolutely sucked ass. I can see why the pyramid is cheaper. The rooms are so outdated and smell like smoke. The 2 AC's we're not enough to cool the rooms off even with the shutters closed. The furniture was out dated, the tv was cracked and both remotes didn'twork. Bathroom was actually nice minus hearing the sound of the neighbors toilet flushing.. . Elevators are so dam slow and the walk to the room was terrible. Smelled smoke in the hallway. Definitely an old hotel feel.. . Room service was over priced. $55 for 2 club sandwiches. Really it's the Luxor not Bellagio.. . Wouldn't be first on my list of hotels.
1st I would really like to praise the nice lady (SILVIA) who checked us in. Her customer service was worthy of 5stars alone . She was awesome , friendly, and helpful. As for the hotel itself I can only give it 4 stars. The employees  weren't very helpful with directions around the hotel and I was a tad bit disappoined with my room . I was expecting more then I got but ill blame that on the Mlife website and their lack of detailed room descriptions but overall things are pretty good here at thee luxor.
We stayed here yesterday after having a spontaneous trip to Vegas. The price was $55 for the night, which seemed great to me! Unfortunately I arrived at 7 a.m. and check in wasn't until 3 p.m. Early check in (10 a.m.) was available for an additional $20, so of course I had to take it. We ended up getting a room on the 24th floor which was actually awesome, but our room didn't have a fridge, microwave or wifi. (Not sure if any of the rooms offer a fridge/microwave). . The bright side to no fridge? Our air conditioner worked great so we just stuck all our water bottles near it and they were cool about an hour later. The beds were comfortable, the room was clean, the pillows were alright (not bad, not great), and all the staff seemed friendly. Many of them greeted us with "Good Morning, how are you today?" as we walked by. All in all I would definitely stay here again. Although they should make check in time earlier!
Front side of facade may look fancy but back side is dirty, clattered with stuff with inch of dust accumulation.  The room was uncomfortable because the walls weren't square and the floor was not level. Elevators weren't working. Pool was closed but they still charged "Resort Fee" Housekeeping knocked the door and reported on room phone that she cleaned our room even we had "Do Not Disturb"sign posted.  I guess they get paid by number of rooms they clean.
Nice bathtub but that is where it ends. No customer service and the answer to why only one elevator is working on a sat night is "they are 20 years old". Maid brought towels and made bed. That is it. Did not clean or replace cups, ice bucket was still full of melted ice, room constantly smelled like feces for the three days with no remedy. Please do not stay here. I cannot wait to leave.
We stayed in the pyramid suite in a non smoking room.  However, our room really smelled like smoke, other than the smell, it felt clean.  The furniture was out dated and could use a refurbish.  The soaking tub was nice after so much walking.  In the bathroom, the toilet paper is so far away from the toilet seat.  You had to plan on how much you would need before sitting down.  The pyramid suites are in the corners of the pyramid.  Be aware that they are a VERY LONG WALK from the elevators.  We did like being connected with indoor walk ways to the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay, that gave us more options for dining and drinking without having to go out in the heat.  Hotel was average, not the worst, not the best.  Given the right price and budget, I would stay there again, if needed.
We stayed in the pyramid, in a single-King bedroom (but on the fifth floor, so we got to use the regular vertical elevators for floors 1-5, which I highly recommend, since I recall long waits for the "inclinators" higher up in the pyramid when we stayed here 20 years ago). Housekeeping and customer service throughout the hotel and casino were excellent. The room had seen better days, but apart from the peeling wallpaper, everything was clean and functional. There were always plenty of machines available in the fitness center. I would have appreciated some shade or night-time hours at the pool (it was above 100F in the daytime for our entire stay, July 19-26th), but otherwise enjoyed the pool. My only complaint was the constant harassment by the time-share salespeople, who are dressed to resemble hotel employees, and are all over the hotel and casino. A friend clued me in that they only approach married couples, so I started walking a few feet behind my husband through the hotel and that seemed to keep them off. Ridiculous. I wouldn't have thought a hotel would want its guests constantly harassed like this, but I guess the kickbacks must make it worthwhile (though I can't imagine who would buy anything from these people.) I'll be sure to investigate which hotels don't have timeshare sales on-site before choosing a hotel in Vegas next time.
One of the best hotels in Vegas that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Very clean, classy. If your afraid of heights, don't look down when getting to and from your room. Quite a drop off! But I digress. Good deal, good hotel and casino.
This hotel is old and needs major renovations. The mattresses are worn out, I had them change my room as I was rolling out of the bed at night because the mattress was so worn. Well the replacement room was even worse and I'm supposedly in an upgraded room. There is no wireless Internet because they are to cheap to put it in yet they still charge you a high resort fee. When trying to discuss this fee they are charging for WIRED internet, they love to use the word "mandatory fee". This fee isn't mandated by the city or the state, it's mandatory by MGM, the owner of the hotel. On the 16th floor of the east tower, the down button for the elevator is missing with an hole for were it should be.
