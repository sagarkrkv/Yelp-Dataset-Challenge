Service was ok. To be honest the first thing that turned me off was the host saying he hopes no one else come because his vacation starts tomorrow. The waitress was nice a little slow but ok. Food was good. Nice portion a little pricey for the quality but overall ok. I'll stick to Ruth Chris if I want a $50 steak lol
The Maitre'd was rude and no one wanted to eat there but we did anyway.  Jose our waiter changed our mind, he was as nice as the Maitre'd was rude. The food was great as was the atmosphere. MY NEPHEW said his steak was life changing.
It's funny I passed by the ad of this place whenever I drove on the freeway, and I finally went after all those years.  Me and my boyfriend went here last night for our anniversary.  We made a reservation in advanced because we weren't sure how busy they get on the weekends.  We get there and we get seated, the light and atmosphere is very romantic.  Our waiter gave us complimentary champagne, which was really nice.  The staff was very friendly and professional.. . He ordered the Fisherman's platter and it was delicious (yes I took a couple bites from him).  And I ordered a 3 large Pacific rock crab claws (unfortunately they ran out of the stone crabs but was not disappointed).  The meat was so sweet and so fresh, I was amazed by each bite!  The sauce that comes along with it compliments the sweetness of the crab meat so well!  We also ordered a Baked sweet potato and Mac & cheese.  They were both delicious!  The potato was so soft and the pecan butter it came with added a hint of sweetness I like.  The mac & cheese was not overpowering with a cheese taste (which I never find when I order mac & cheese).. . And lastly for dessert, we ordered Banana cream pie.  It was excellent!  Not an overpowering banana taste with great sweetness from the foster sauce.. . Overall our experience was wonderful and very relaxing.  Of course the bill is going to be high, but it was expected.  We'll definitely be back for more.  Next time, I will try the stone crab they are so famous for!
It's pricey. but definitely worth every penny. . . One of the best restaurants I've had in Vegas. The stone crab and steaks are amazing! . . I had the 20oz Bone-In Rib Eye medium rare, so tender and moist and cooked perfectly. Can feed two people easily, I was a fatty and ate the whole thing myself. We also got the large stone crabs which are $27 per piece. Don't know if that was really worth it, but it is reallllly good and fresh.. . Will definitely be back to try the select size since they ran out the first time. Make reservations ahead of time!!!!
I've been here with my husband twice before for anniversary dinners and this place is by far my favorite out of anywhere! . . Always impeccable service - they are always kind and friendly, the good is amazing and worth every penny, and they usually suggest excellent wine. . . Atmosphere is classy and elegant  without being stuffy, which is exactly what I look for in fine dining. . . We will continue to visit here year after year! My husband usually has a steak and lobster and he swears they are amazing (he's a tough critic) I always try something new and am never disappointed! Five stars and I would recommend indefinitely!!
All in all, one of our best meal experiences ever. Server Jon was great,  ask for him. We had the crab cake for an alletizer. Light and very good. Did steak for dinner. Filet and bone in ribeye for the entre.  Both prepared perfectly and very good. . . Recommended sides were Hash Browns and Roasted Corn and did not disappoint. Simple and delicious. . . To dessert, we got "small" orders of banana creme pie and coconut creme pie. Per the Mrs., banana creme was the best piece of pie she's ever eaten. Both were fresh and wonderful. You have to pay a little to eat here, but you certainly get what you pay for.
Honestly, I was in the area to get some $1 oysters at PJ Clarke's but they've closed down!!!! :(  So the group and I took the next closest thing, even though we weren't looking to spend a bunch but it happens.... . So I went through the cheaper route while dining here so I'm pretty sure I didn't get the full experience.  I ordered the filet mignon (6 oz) lunch special at I believe $27 which comes with Joes Grilled Tomato and Jennies Mashed Potatoes.  It also comes with a selection of a slice of pie, which I chose the Havana.  . . The steak was cooked very well and they do bring out some steak salt to season to your liking.  Honestly, I would rather have the chef season it his taste so as the seasoning can permeate the meat better but not everyone would feel the same way.  The tomato was topped with their famous creamed spinach and topped with cheddar cheese under a broiler for a few seconds.  The spinach was very rich and I am glad I didn't get a full order of that.  The sampling was just enough for me.  The potatoes were also seasoned with bread crumbs and more cheese.  A very rich meal that relies on comfort food.  . . That dessert though.... To sum it up, essentially like a dulce de leche pie made from the heavens.  They make their pies in house and you can definitely tell.  Each bite was so rich yet so good, coffee does wonders with this dessert.  My friend also got the same combo and ordered the key lime pie.  Damn. The dessert chef here knows his/her stuff.  Be sure to order a slice if you don't get the combo.. . Service was very hospitable and welcoming, and the bread baskets will definitely fill you up if you're not careful. They serve about 5 different types of bread for all kinds of different tastes.  Although I didn't get order oysters from here, I was still very satisfied. Next time, I'll come back and try what everyone else raves about and also in their name, the stone crabs. :)
Mark the bartender made our experience awesome. Not only was the food phenomenal but the friendliness of the bar staff made for a fun lunch.  We came back for dinner a couple of days later because of this and he not only remembered us but remembered the wine I drank when I couldn't.   Truly a memorable time
There aren't many places in Oklahoma to get some food like this so we had to get some fresh seafood while in town. The place was amazing. Staff were the best. Wish I was rich so I could have left them the tip they deserved. The meat out of the crab legs was the size of a hot dog. We left sad cause it'll be forever till we get legs that good again
The food is excellent here for the price. I had the prime rib. Both bone in and without(cooked perfect, med rare) stone crabs were awesome too!
My boyfriend surprised me with a date night here. The boy sure couldn't have done any better! The service was great. As soon as they saw our unsure and confused looks while attempting to properly east the stone crab for the first time, they came to our rescue. . . The Food:. Apps. Shrimp Cocktail - The shrimps were huge and tasted great! The cocktail sauce was extremely hot, but I don't mind it that way.. . Large stone crab claws w/mustard sauce - Those claws held the sweetest most buttery crab I have ever tasted. The mustard sauce definitely put it over the top! Heck, even my boyfriend, who usually turns his nose up to mustard sauces enjoyed it. . . Main Course. Filet & Lobster tail - AMAZING! The filet was seasoned and cooked to perfection! One of the best I have ever had. The lobster tail was sweet and tasty.. . Stuffed Sole - So good! This was my boyfriends dish, and he reluctantly gave up a bite to me. The fish was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was wonderful. . . Grilled corn side dish - It is rare to find a side dish that can hold its own against a meal, but this corn was absolutely delicious. The corn was off the cob and grilled to perfection. Topped with butter, cilantro, lime, and salt.
Always love their Stone Crab and bread
One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  Excellent food, both the seafood and steaks. In fact one of the best steaks I ever had is the bone-in NY Strip that they serve. The Stone Crabs are delicious and the scallops are amazing.  Grilled tuna steak just ok, they tend to over cook the tuna. Salads are superb. The grilled corn side dish is delicious. The grilled tomatoes are not worth trying.  We have been to this restaurant several times and they always remember us.  Highly recommend...and make sure you have a reservation.
Good food. We went here for lunch and got fish tacos. The tacos were fine. They give you freshly baked bread which is good. It's in a god location and the servers were professional.
If you have a group over 10, make sure you make reservations weeks or at least days in advance (we did)! The food here is incredible, I don't think one person complained. It will be pricey, but bear in mind you are fine dining in Vegas. The sides like the mash potatoes can easily be split between two people. We split the stone crab for appetizers.. My recommendations. Try the stone crab, what they're known for. Crab bisque is the best you'll ever find (ask for extra crab meat). Steaks are massive, probably won't finish if you have an appetizer and been drinking for a while . PS. IF you're new to Vegas, be prepared to walk long distances, I clocked our time from hotel room within Caesars at 28 minutes (0.6 miles). We were 5 minutes late and lost two of our guys. They won't let you sit down unless everyone's present!
Very good seafood
Fantastic experience.. While on our honeymoon, my husband and I wanted to spoil ourselves with one night out to a really great restaurant. After much research, we decided on Joe's. We made a reservation online.. We showed up right on time and waited about 5 minutes to be seated. I have never seen a place so packed in my life. The restaurant is huge.. . We were seated at a booth in their back room. Our waitor was fantastic. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the food.. . We ordered calamari for an appetizer. I love calamari and order it almost anywhere I can. I'm from New England so I love seafood. This was probably some of the best cooked calamari I've ever had. It wasn't chewy at all, with a melt in your mouth texture. The seasoning was perfect.. . My husband ordered the petite filet. It was, also, cooked perfect. Warm red center and didn't even need a steak knife to cut through.. . I ordered the crab stuffed shrimp. It was really good. Not the best thing I've ever eaten, but still really good. I do wish I would have ordered the petite filet after tasting my husbands, though. It was that good.. We ordered a side of Jennie's mashed potatoes which were fantastic.. . But, to my favorite part... dessert..... I ordered the apple pie and my husband ordered the coconut cream pie.. His was good. Mine was incredible. The piece of pie they gave my was GIANT with a generous helping of vanilla ice cream. My husband ate all of his and then some of mine it was so big.. I dream about that apple pie now.. . Just go. It's great. The service is fantastic and the food is amazing. Worth every penny.
Thanks Patrick for making our dating anniversary so much fun! . We've lived in Las Vegas for almost 20 years and this was the first visit to Joe's.. They have (without a doubt) the BEST creamed spinach I have ever tasted at a restaurant. I had the Dover Sole and my man had the Stone Crab Claws. . Oh yum! The key lime pie? Wonderful!
In a city of opulent choices, This is one of my favorites. No gimmicks or pretense just Great food with Great service.
Great experience! Highly recommended! Had a party of 11 people and everyone enjoyed themselves and the food.
We have been to Joe's many times, and Saturday nights meal knocked it out of the park.  We started off with a pacific crab (suggested by our server) because the stone crab was out of season.  I have had the stone crab out of season in the past and was disappointed.  I ordered the Dover Sole which is always good and my husband ordered a Ribeye.  The steak was cooked to perfection, he used a pinch of the seasoning salt and we both thought it was outstanding.  For sides I had read about the roasted sweet corn (it deserved all the hype) and the steamed asparagus.  We ALWAYS get the coleslaw - it is the best coleslaw around, prepared table side.  The coleslaw has two big slices of tomato and is light and flavorful.  This time we skipped desert - to full.  I would recommend all the deserts especially the Key Lime Pie.
The food is good, complimentary bread basket is delicious, and the service is outstanding. However, for the price, we expected larger servings and more complex flavors. As with most places in Vegas, everything is served al a carte, so the bill will be large if you'd like sides. Overall, it was tasty.
I've been here several times...Always amazing service. I realized that I could eat stone crab everyday and this is where I would go to get it. Even the mixed green side salad was great. I recommend that with the stone crabs for your meal if you're into that and want a satisfying yet healthy meal. My man got the ahi tuna sandwich which was very tasty. I'll try that next time I come.
I had to admit that the atmosphere was nice and the Manhattan clam chowder was completely exceeding my expectation, however the main dish rib eye and spinach was very disapponiting. We asked for medium, it ended up with at least medium well level and was a bit too salty according to my friend. We obviously did not finish the meat. Probably I'm gonna try the crab leg next time, but definitely not the steak.
Incredible dinner and excellent service. We ordered the scallops and crab stuffed shrimp with the mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. The scallops were the best I have ever eaten, and the sides were amazing. Our server was professional and friendly, and eager to assist in any way possible. Our drinks were delicious, and I highly recommend the cucumber martini. Overall an exceptional experience.
Thanks to a nice win at the craps table....the large order of the King Crab legs were the best I've had in a long time.
