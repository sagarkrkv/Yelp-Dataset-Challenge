Had dinner here for the first time this past Thursday.  Food was terrific.  Wait staff was a C and totally overshadowed by the food, as well as the extremely friendly hostess.  . I had he pork belly pastrami as an appetizer and it was amazing.  Then had the coffee rubbed filet, what was equally terrific!  . Loud but fun atmosphere.  Very friendly hostess and bar staff.  Our server just seemed disinterested...
This is one of the highest rated restaurants in the area. I didn't know what to expect here. I was in T-shirt and jeans which seemed a bit underdressed because people were in dress shirts and ladies in nice blouses. . . Food: . I ordered Scallops and a beer. . Scallops - Cooked to perfection. . . Service: . I sat by the bar and didn't really need much service. The bartenders were fairly attentive though dropping by every now and then to see if I wanted another beer. . . Environment: . Great first date spot. Heck there were 3 couples in the bar area that seemed like it was their first date. Good food with loud vibes. Dress to impress type of restaurant. . . Price: . $20 - $40 per head. . . Food: 5. Service: 5. Environment: 5. Price: 3
Very friendly staff and excellent service. Food was amazingly good. Starter portion was small (crab cake) but extremely good! Main course portion size was good and filling.
I'm still kicking myself for not venturing into Citizen long ago.  I found myself hungry and wanting a good meal a week back.  Citizen had always been in the back of mind and I decided to make my way to Old Town and give it a try.  Do not walk, run to Citizen.  . . I was greeted warmly by staff and a lovely atmosphere.  Dark wood beams surrounded by warm butter colored walls and soft candle light.  White table cloths and black and white pictures adorn the walls of this beautiful structure.  I started with the pastrami pork belly with hints of horseradish that play perfectly with mustard and brussel sprouts.  A dish that could be too rich if executed carelessly.  Absolutely perfect.  Followed by the scallops.  Perfectly cooked to medium rare.  Very sweet with the right amount of pan sear.  . . The staff is attentive and not overwhelming.  I felt at home.  I'm still dreaming of the pastrami pork belly.  Well done, my friends.  Well done.
Bacon-wrapped scallops with grits! Wow are they delicious as is the chopped salad. The scallop was tender and perfectly seared and the grits were heavenly and creamy.  Honestly I've never had a bad meal here, only downside is that it's a bit noisy. Highly recommend!
I had the scallops which were delicious. The creamy polenta was really good and the bacon popcorn was dangerously good! My bf had the tenderloin which he thought was great and I also had the Thai Margarita which had a spicy salted rim and was surprisingly delish. Service was very attentive and not at all pushy. For a mid-range dinner spot, it's as good as it gets! Entrees about $20-35. . . The hostess was friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend!
Love this place.  Great atmosphere, great drinks and wonderful food.  The Original Chopped Salad is the best salad ever and I'm glad CPH has it on the menu.  The scallops are also delicious.  The best thing is the bar.  CPH has a ton of great and unique drinks and for those who can't make up their minds, the bartenders will concoct something great for you.  Only things that get it 4 versus 5 stars are the menu--I love what I've eaten but would like to see more options, and some of the staff are not knowledgeable about the menu and could be a bit friendlier (i.e. I went while pregnant but not yet showing and declined to order a drink and the waiter acted like I was absolutely nuts.  He kept asking me if I changed my mind and wanted a drink).
Great Food, Great Location and Design with great people to serve you!
OMG. Went here yesterday the second time. This time with lomita for my pre birthday dinner. While it is a bit loud, it's a fun atmosphere and the food and the service surpasses all your expectations.. Our waiter Gary made this a special evening for us. We started with the pork belly pastrami (a party in your mouth), and then following with their famous chopped salad (it has it's own facebook page!!!), and shared the best filet mignon ("pass penny please") we had in a looooong time. . The desert, flourless chocolate cake with homemade strawberry ice cream, was on the house (nice touch) and served us well through the birthday night into the morning.. Btw: make Gary sing, hehe
Came here yesterday for my birthday. Party of 9, 730 reservation. Greeted at the door by Sam, who ended up being our table's server. Shook my hand, asked my name, wished me a happy birthday, told us the table was ready but to have a drink at the bar and let him know when we were ready. Excellent welcome.. . The place was busy, no empty tables except our big table in the semi-private corner. Ordered a Manhattan, girlfriend had a mule, both great versions of classic cocktails. The rest of our party arrived, ordered drinks and the hostess showed us to our table.. . Great table, excellent service, Sam had great recommendations and bought me a bday shot of blended tequila. Everyone at the table enjoyed the food; scallops, ribs, mac&cheese, chopped salad, one of my guests is a chef, he ordered a chef special and he left impressed. This place has it all covered. Excellent. 5 stars.
The menu was tasteful in scope where you didn't feel bombarded with choices.  The service was outstanding.  The staff knows exactly what they are doing here - so does the chef.  Our group had four different entrees and every dish was high in quality, perfectly prepared and very tasty.  The scallops were cooked exactly right with the right sear and buttery texture.. . The atmosphere was just okay.  The lighting, background music, and seating layout was just right.  The place was a little noisy.  . . At the end of the day, this is the kind of place where I want to come back again and again to try everything they have available on the menu.
Been going here for a long long time with only positive opinions of the place and unfortunately a new insecure Bar Manager makes me write the following.  So disappointed that I feel the need to write my one and only review on yelp but the management need to know.  After sitting down at the bar tonight alone.  First drink of the night.  I order my first drink and an appetizer. Some guys sit by me.  They are having their first drink if the night.  And after 20 mins the bar man gets a stick up his ass about all of us and refuses to serve us all and returns all the food.  I have no idea what the hell got his goat.  After the other two guys left I was so disappointed I called over the manager who supported the bar guy without question!  Really?  Whoever the owner is they need to really look at the over sensitivity of their managers. Great food, great vibe,... Usually...  Unfortunately spoiled by poor management staff with self confidence issues. Good luck guys you just lost one regular and a few locals.
The food was spectacular, we split a bunch of appetizers. Crab cakes were moist, tuna perfectly cooked, and the pork belly pastrami was magnificent - smooth like butter. The grilled cheese is worth it and the bacon peach pie made me feel like I was home in the south. P.S. The staff, outstanding. Brad made excellent recommendations.
By far the best service I've ever had in Arizona. Our waiter, Sam, knew everything about not only the menu, but the intricacies of how it was prepared. The scallops and the chopped salad are amazing btw. I can't believe I haven't been here before. The perfect place for gastronomers in the area who are picky with what they want.
Just Ok...probably would not come back.  Chicken wings were "Asian chili glazed" came out with the sauce on the side that tasted more like tomato than Asian chili. . Meatloaf was decent and flatbread with hummus was very good.  Nice atmosphere and excellent service.
Everytime I'm in Scottsdale, I make a trip to Citizen...sometimes; four trips!. . Don't miss The Original Chopped Salad. This thing is unreal. I spent $50 on ingredients trying to re-create it at home, but there's only one Original.. . The craft cocktails are quite good. I had a Manhattan with Tobacco & Leather bitters that was just phenomenal. I don't think it's on the current menu, so hopefully they'll still make it for you. Russel's Reserve Bourbon, Carpano Sweet Leaf Vermouth, Tobacco and Leather bitters, Maple syrup, toasted orange peel and Marasca  cherry. YUM.. . For entrees: take a close look at the Meatloaf and the Short ribs. Both excellent!
My boyfriend and I were wandering around Old Town Scottsdale late one afternoon and happened to walk by Citizen Public House. It was getting close to dinner time so we decided to pop in. Neither one of us realized that we were about to have an amazing dinner! Wow! I think it is probably one of those restaurants where every item on the menu is excellent, but the Truffle Grilled Cheese was so good that I don't know if I could bring myself to order anything else. My boyfriend is still talking about how amazing his lamb burger was. We can't wait to go back! Also, the noise level wasn't too bad when we were there, but it might get a little loud when it's really packed. Excellent service too!
Fantastic food. Started with the chopped salad and tuna appetizers. Then went with the scallops and meatloaf. Oh my both were fabulous. Finish up the the cocoa the sponge cake. Left so full but so satisfied and happy.  The atmosphere is definitely on the noisy side. The service was excellent with three folks constantly filling water and clearing plates. Great food .
Gary was the best waiter I've had in years!!! So entertaining, funny, and really sold all the entrees to us. If you own a restaurant, you'd want all servers to be like him. I came one other time and my server was not entertaining or all that attentive.... Kind of dull. . . The food here is great although their menu is a little small. No complains though! Definitely a little too dark in some spots too.. I remember us sitting in almost total darkness. All in all it's a great date spot or good for happy hour after work.
A friend chose Citizen for her birthday dinner and I wasn't thrilled with the small menu, but I ended up finding a few things that looked pretty good. It was my first experience with the original chopped salad and it was F'in delicious. . . She was turning 29, so most of us are too young to be saying this, but the general consensus was that it was too dark, too loud and too warm, so that's the lower rating. The service was average, but she did let us know ahead of time that they couldn't split that many checks and helped up split it up as best she could.. . I'd definitely return for a special occasion with a smaller group or likely, just a significant other.
Let me begin by stating that I'm from Los Angeles, and was not looking forward to the food during my trip to AZ. I usually don't leave reviews after a single visit but given the scenario, I thought why not.. . This place is very good. Even in the cut throat restaurant business in LA, this place would make the mark.. . The food is all great. I tried the lamb sandwich, meat loaf and short ribs. The short ribs were outstanding, and for 30 bucks, it was also a steal. Very strong beef flavor. Meat loaf was also among the better meat loaf dishes i had ever tried. It's pretty hard to make meatloaf taste "not boring" but the dish here was solid. The lamb burger came with battered fries which were very good with the homemade ketchup which was like a marinara. I'm surprised battered fries aren't more popular. The appetizer was my favorite: the pork belly pastrami. Very rich, not for everyone but portioned appropriately. . Service is great, ambience is perfect not too loud, not too quiet. Not too bright, not too dark. Price point is fairly accurate.. . What makes this a 5 star rather than a 4 star however are the mixed drinks. They are spectacular. I had a 'Manhattan' which was perfect. So good that it hit me hard without me noticing. The 'career ender' was also good. . . It's hard to maintain 800 reviews and still have a 4.5 star overall but I certainly see why this place succeeded in doing so. Next time I'm in old town Scottsdale I'll stop by again for sure.
