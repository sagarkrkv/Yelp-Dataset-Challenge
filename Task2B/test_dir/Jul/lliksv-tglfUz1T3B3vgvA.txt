This is the best, most authentic Thai restaurant outside of Thailand ! . . Most Thai restaurants in the U.S. are really set up for western taste buds. Meaning, they are not really the type or the taste of food you get in Thailand. At Lotus of Siam, yes, they have the Pad Thai and things like that for those who do not like the spiciness of traditional Thai food, but what they also have is a great selection of true traditional Thai dishes, meaning they are spicy. . . If you want to eat true Thai food, look on the menu under the Northern Thai section and the Chef's Choice. The food is great !. . This restaurant also has a vast selection of wine. This is very unusual for a Thai restaurant. Personally, though I love a nice bottle of wine, I don't really think of wine in association with Thai food. But, they do have it, if you want it. Plus, they also have a good selection of beer, Thai Iced Coffee, and other drinks like that. . . This restaurant is located in a strip mall. Though there are several other international restaurants around it, the outside is not inviting. Don't let this scare you off. Once inside the restaurant is very nice. . . Finally, this is a very popular restaurant. People pack the place every day and night of the week. It is best to make a reservation or you may be waiting quite a while for a table.. . Highly Recommended !!!
Great prices, really tasty food. I took a girl here, we ordered the Yom Yom Shrimp (I think) we had some spicy coconut cream chicken with white rice. It was delicious. The drunken seafood dish was kind of clunky, and I didn't need it. I want to go back and try some of the other options. The green tea was good ;). I liked the check the best, very manageable for the amount of flavor and fun we had. The service was flawless.
One of the best thai restaurants in Vegas I've been here twice and both times I left very full and satisfied. The service lacks alittle but the food is well worth waiting for. . . Papaya salad_ really spicy but addicting. . Angel wings_ so crispy and good we ordered 2. . Fried catfish_we weren't aware how big it would be but we killed it among 5 people. . Yellow curry_flavorful and had a nice kick. We got spicy level 7. . Pad Thai_ can't really go wrong with this dish.. . Fried prawns_ crispy and they also fry the heads so they are like chips. . Sweet and sour chicken_ I think this was my least favorite. Nothing to special. . Mango sticky rice_ great way to put you in a food coma. . Definitely would come back here when I'm in town
Heard about this place and was told it was the best. Not the best but still good. Had the Tempura, beef pad thai, Nam kao tod, and spicy basil beef. Loved the tempura and the Nam kao tod. They have a great selection of wine and Saki. You must make reservations because this place was packed from the time we walked in till we left and I mean tons of people waiting! Prices were good, service ehhh could have been better. We had to call our waiter more than a few times and they kind of try to get you in and out. This was for dinner time! It wasn't what I though it was going to be. Don't go expecting what you see in the magazines!
This is the bomb when it comes to Thai food. Looks like a shanty strip mall  from the outside but opens up on the inside. Surprisingly most of the customers are Americans and hardly any asians.. The Garlic Shrimp is a must. Dont go there unless you gona order the garlic shrimp. Or else you deserve a punch in the face. Northern Thai cooking is their specialty and it is spicy. So if your a wuss about spicy food, then go to McDonalds on the same street and order a bic mac then kill yourself. If you want great spicy thai cooking then plant yourself in this place, save it on your bookmark and gps and enjoy... Now STFU, stop reading and freaking order, NOW!!!!!!
1. Food:. A) Tofu Green Curry: Flavorful and perfect. I somehow ate all my rice soaking it up with the curry. B) Steam Ginger Sea Bass: Fresh and tender, a bit pricey but very healthy choice. C) Fried Rice: Chicken or was it Crab spicy something, either was it was so good. A tad bit oily but our whole party loved it. D) Curry Noodles: Not bad, but not my favorite. E) Raw shrimp: They had it with their special sauce and with lemon, it was so good. F) Tom Kai Soup: It was good but too sour for me. We can skip it for next time. . G) Whole fish: Forgot what it was called but its one of the fish that was a whole fish not fish and they deep fried it with pour sauce over. . H) Thai Tea: Delicious. I Wine: They have quite a big selection, so we had the Dr Loosen 2012 Sonnemhr: Not pricey and went well with the meal. 2. Decor: Simple asian restaurant. . 3. Price: Fair, not cheap but for how good the food tasted it def wasn't considered pricey. . 4. Service: Really great and attentive even as busy as they were. Walk in's were at least 1 hr to 1.5 hr. So make sure you reserve before hand. My coworkers and I always go here after our convention so we make sure we plan it beforehand.
I have been here 2x's for lunch. The restaurant location / shopping center appears to be a bit dodgey but the food is consistent, service excellent and fairly priced. Not a tourist trap and great food.
Food: Combination Fried RIce, Pad Thai, Curry were delicious. Deep fried Pawns were Decent.. . Service: Decent. We had a party of 6 and the place was packed for dinner on a weekday.  We waited 30 min to be seated and it took another 10 min or so to get our order through. Food came out quickly.. . Facility: Could be better. Floors were sticky and there wasn't a baby changing table in the bathroom!. . The place is a little far from where i live (N. Las Vegas) but i would drive down there again to eat me some goooooooood Thai food.
In 1998 I moved to Las Vegas on my 21st birthday. I worked at Casino Royale on the Strip as a bartender and sometimes just showed up at the Cheetah and jumped on the pole. There was a pomegranate tree growing outside my window on Gypsy Lane, and hummingbirds would fly up to feed at it. Air travel was wonderful in those days, so I would often take off for the weekend, to LA, SF, CO or NM. Nobody knew how amazing Lotus of Siam was, and it was my favorite place to eat.. . I moved back to NYC later that year, but I returned to Las Vegas in 2003 to get married. Having seen many other friends tie the knot since then, I will say this. Las Vegas weddings are the best. Don't just do a bachelor party. Make it one big party for everyone. No parents, no kids. Everyone arranges their own travel, and then block out some hotel rooms for your guests and have fun. . . Now that you have an idea of what I call romance, Lotus of Siam is a great date spot. It's been forever since I've been back to Vegas, but I recall this was tucked into a strip mall with a shooting range, a bail bonds, a pawn shop, a check cashing and a trashy lingerie shop. Basically, everything you want one stop shopping, even if you have to beg, borrow or steal, and why not go for the hat trick?. . Why am I remembering them? Because that was a seriously awesome time. They opened a NY restaurant, had a falling out with their business partner, who tried to make it fancy, and I respect that they wanted more management control, though they're so old, it was too much for them, running two locations. I appreciate how passionately they feel about the food and their reputation. That also means long waits and big crowds, so I will fondly remember those halcyon days and that delicious Thai food.
Wanted to try this place about a year ago, but didn't since we needed to catch an early show and didn't want to rush dinner.  Knowing that this place gets pretty busy during dinner time, one friend suggested that I call in to make a reservation.  I called and staff said all reservations were full, but walk-ins were welcome.  Okay, no reservation.  So either we go in for an early dinner (before 5:30) or a late dinner (after 7:30).  We decided on the late dinner.  And yeah, we endedup eating pretty late.  We got to the restaurant at 9:30, half an hour before it close.  When we walked into the restaurant I was surprised that there were still so many people there.  Besides us, there were even people waiting to be seated.  I thought that with it being almost closing time, restaurant would be pretty empty.. . We waited for about 5 minutes before we got seated.  We got to sit at a bigger table so there's plenty of room.  The staffs were friendly and efficient.  Our food orders came out quickly.  . . fried tofu (bean curd) -- nicely fried tofu with cabbage strips on the bottom and a side of plum sauce.  The tofu was crispy on the outside and silky on the inside.  I like it a lot.  . . roasted duck curry -- the flavor was good.  You get pieces of roasted duck with pineapple pieces and the usual veggies.  Not too spicy.  Good for people who like some heat but don't want to start sweating from it.   But for people who like extra spicy food or who wants to sweat, I think you can probably ask them to make it more spicy.  Entree comes with a side of rice.    . . garlic shrimp -- jumbo plump shrimps deep fried with the shell on.  The shrimps were butterflied before frying so it's so crispy that you can actually eat the shell .  The flavor was on point.  If you like you can dip it in plum sauce, but there's enough flavor where you didn't have to.  I enjoyed this dish.. . pad se eww -- Nice flavor, well cooked, and not overly greasy.  The flat noodle was cooked just right so that it's not dry.  The noodle did not stick together.  The vegetable was tender.  Liked it.    . . This is a nice restaurant to eat at.  I enjoyed my meal.
came here for lunch while visiting Vegas. had high expectations for this place based on the reviews. they also have a lunch buffet ($13.99/person i believe) we ordered off of the regular menu. I felt like the food lacked of flavors and the service was not so attentive. we ordered 3 dishes;. . -garlic chicken wings. was over cooked, and very dry. didn't have much garlic/flavor. . . -Chicken Tom yum soup. could've been a bit more sour, since that's the purpose of 'tom yum'. . -Chicken Pad thai. tasted very bland. could've had a bit more bean sprouts & peanuts in it. . . they charge $2 for steamed rice on the side. the server was not attentive, our waters were not filled and we were not able to get any of the servers attention. We might not dine here again when visiting Vegas.
Best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. Some say it's the best in the USA and it would be hard to argue otherwise. Mind blown. Don't let the trashy 1970's communist Russian-style strip mall discourage you. Lotus of Siam is as good as any Thai food that I have ever had. I like my Thai food spicy and authentic and you can get both here is spades. The wait is long but worth it... prepare for at least 1 hour. Four of us ran up a tab of $250 with just a few beers and a good 15 dishes, we just couldn't stop eating.
Delicious and worth the wait. Come ready to wait in line, and take some time to review the menu or go next door for the massage. The stuffed chicken and shrimp noodles were exceptional. Enjoy a great dinner off the Vegas strip.
I entered Lotus of Siam knowing nothing of real Thai cuisine. I had only really had Pad Thai and basic curries - so my 5 star might be taken with a grain of salt.. . I found the food to be delicious and exciting.. . The crispy duck with basil was phenomenal - tender meat, uber crispy skin and flavorful sauce.. . The sticky rice with mango and coconut ice cream was enlightening. Simply but one of the best desserts I've experienced.. . I also had the Pad Prick Ong, egg noodles and green papaya salad. The next time I go to Vegas I'll eat dinner here every night to explore the menu more.. . Must get reservations!
Best Thai food I've had in America. Some of the dish portions were smaller that I expected but we were in a large group and all the dishes were gobbled up really quickly. I loved the duck curry and Thai ice teas!! Wish I had more time to go back again! It's a must stop for international foodies!
Lotus of Siam, often referred to as the best Thai restaurant in America, has by now garnered a ton of accolades and press. Still, it sits in an easily overlooked and unassuming strip mall away from The Strip. The walls are adorned with famous celebrities as former patrons. There's still a wait, although much of that may be to create the illusion of a packed dining room (it's not). We waited about an hour for a table for six, although the table had been empty the entire time. . . The menu itself is huge and includes dishes from Northern Thailand not found in your average Thai restaurant. Based on prior reviews, we ordered the nam kao tod and the sea bass drunken noodles. We added on some typical Thai plates such as pineapple fried rice, pad see ew, and the spicy garlic chicken wings. The nam kao tod beef was good, but inconsistent. Some of the pieces were perfect, while others were more tough and dry. The must-try dish of the night was the sea bass. The fish was perfectly fried, but the drunken noodles left much to be desired. The pineapple fried rice was and pad see ew were average. . . We finished with a mango sticky rice for dessert, which was amazing. The mangos were as sweet as can be and the sticky rice was topped with just the right amount of lavender to give it a floral aroma with every bite. Overall, the sea bass was a bit pricey and the other dishes were okay, but it was a good meal, albeit pricey for Thai. I have to return to try the garlic prawns. Come with a group of friends (but come early) so you can try as many of the 150 dishes as possible.
I think the biggest mistake I made coming here was that I was expecting to be blown away. Afterall, some people say this is "America's best Thai restaurant." That being said, the food was really authentic, the shrimp were fresh and huge, and the service was warm!. . 1. Thai Iced Coffee - Oh My Heaven, I would've chugged this all day if I could have!. . 2. Garlic Prawns - yum! I'm don't always love fried shrimp, but these are perfectly golden fried (not greasy), are tender, and have a subtle seasoning. . 3. Chu Chee Shrimp - Oh my goodness NOM! This was similar to a Red Curry but was super fresh and light tasting. . . 4. Kao Soi - I'm not in to soupy noodles, but my friend ordered this. His mom was raised in Thailand and he has had the dish at home and in Thailand many times. He thoroughly enjoyed it!. . 5. Thai Iced Tea - this was fine, though I would've preferred a stronger tea flavor (it was alittle bland due to too much milk). . 6. Mango Sticky Rice - I suppose it's hard for this dish to ever really blow anyone away. It was good, and the seasoning on the sticky rice was a nice contrast to the sweet mango. . Tip: make a reservation for dinner to avoid a 2+ hour wait. You should be fine for lunch though (we have no wait at 1:45pm on a Friday).
yes, it's good. and yes, the prawns are good.
Such great food! It is fresh, and so yummy! It is a must go to when in Vegas. . . Don't judge it by the outside, it is in a pretty crappy looking strip mall... but so worth it when you go inside!
I was there at the Lotus Siam week of 4th of July.  Per Anthony Bourdain recommend trying garlic prawns.   Yes, it was the best thing I ever eaten next line to soft shall crab!  I wish I could have tried other dishes...  Perhaps next year July,  I would definitely visit again.  Btw, it is hard to get a cab service between 2:30 to 3:30.  Plan accordingly!
Very disappointed after all the hype. Too sour: crispy rice. Very weird: garlic prawns. No vegetables in panang curry.
This was on my list of must-try places in Las Vegas. I think it was a bit over-hyped. Or maybe I just didn't order properly. I've had some amazing Thai food and can't say this was better than anything I've had in the past. Some of the Northern style dishes I can't compare but I don't think they were spectacular based on their own merit. But the celebrity endorsements and accolades on the wall can't be wrong can they? . . Let me just start by saying that this restaurant is in a totally sketchy neighborhood. There's even a sign in the restaurant that says that you shouldn't leave your luggage in the car. They have luggage storage in the restaurant so you can bring your stuff in with you. The whole strip mall looks like a bombed out war zone and I'll bet it's pretty scary when it's dark. Like zombies-come-out-and-attack scary. . . It's a nice surprise when you enter the restaurant and see it bustling with, not zombies, but living humans - totally the opposite of the ghost town outside. There does seem to be the illusion that it's busier than it actually is (at least when we walked in). We requested a table for 4. They told us 45 minute wait. We said we'd come back, then they chased us down the parking lot and said 30 minutes, then as we were walking away again, they said they had a table available. When we got in, there seemed to be quite a few open tables. . . As for the food we did as advised and mostly ordered from the Northern dishes at the back of the menu.  . . The Spicy Chicken Wings (regular menu) were delicious. My son said they were the best chicken wings he'd ever had. They were crispy and came in just enough chili sauce so the chicken didn't get soggy.. . The Seafood Soup (regular menu) was okay. It was pretty spicy. The bowl came with one scallop, two mussels, a prawn and some squid. It was okay but not the best Thai Seafood soup I've had. . . The Red Chili Dip (ground pork in chili sauce) served with fried pork rinds and veggies was pretty bland. It needed salt or something. Everyone basically ignored it after one taste. . . The Garlic Prawns were FABULOUS. Crispy prawns, battered, fried with heads, shells, tails and all. Honestly, the best part were the fried shells - they were like potato chips. My hubby thought they could've used a sweet and sour dip and I agree that might have been nice, but I liked them just fine the way they were. . . The Crispy Duck with Mint Leaves were served on top of noodles in a sauce and topped with some herbs and peppers. Personally, I don't think crispy duck should be served with anything wet (like sauce) because it makes the crispiness go away. I've had some amazing crispy duck and this duck didn't really do anything for me (or my hubby who LOVES crispy duck). . . Fried Bananas with Coconut Ice Cream for dessert was good. Nothing special. They didn't have the sticky rice with mango available. The bananas were wrapped in wonton wrappers then fried. Nothing wrong with that, but I can also make this at home. . . All of this and a couple glasses of wine came out to about $132 before tip. The prawns and the duck were both over $20 bucks. Otherwise, everything else was around $8-15. . . All in all, spicy chicken wings and garlic prawns were good. Everything else: MEH. I might go back and check out the front of menu next time. There are some pretty fine Thai restaurants in the Silicon Valley/Bay Area that I think are MUCH better.
Incredible hole-in-the-wall Thai place! Went with 5 other friends and split ten dishes all family style - all delicious. Definitely recommend the Khao Soi Braised Short Rib, the spicy chicken wings, and the garlic prawns
We had a group of 9, so we were able to try about 14 different entrees and 6 appetizers in our 2 visits (Yes we went 2 days in a row). ALL the food was great! Definitely the best Thai I've ever had, except the chicken Larb Salad, which was only ok, as I've had better in 2 other places. A few items that stick out were, garlic prawns, drunken noodles with soft shell crab and the duck with chu-chee. I also enjoyed the mango rice for dessert. Overall, I would give this place 4.5 stars for food, 4 stars for service. Also, be sure to make reservations or you will wait up to an hour.
For Thai food in the Vegas area, it's fantastic. For Thai food in general, it's okay.. . Despite being off the strip and in a secluded plaza, Lotus of Siam is hyped up by almost any Vegas native/frequenter who recommends Thai food to you. The head chef is a chef who formerly worked at the Wynn, so it's easy to see why people are excited about it. The place is usually packed with people, so reservations might be recommended (although we just walked in and had no problem getting seated).. . The food itself isn't bad. It's chock full of flavor, but I can't say it's the best Thai food I've ever had considering each dish is in the double digits. (Not unusual for Vegas.) We ordered the Pad Thai and sea bass with drunken noodles with two Thai iced teas; everything was decent, but not worth the money, in my opinion.. . Lotus of Siam is worth checking out if you're craving some Thai food while in Vegas, but keep your expectations lower if you come from an area that is familiar with Thai food.
Last time we were in the Vegas area we tried Lotus of Siam. We had heard rave reviews and knew celebrities even frequented the place. When we first pulled up, we were a little surprised by the restaurant's appearance. It's definitely not fancy, and isn't in the nicest of neighborhoods. Nonetheless, we had heard such great things about the food so we were excited to give it a try. When we walked in, the inside was pretty cute. We had quite a long wait (as other reviewers said, reservations are a good idea). We thought we'd just go to the bar and have a drink while we waited. The bartender was AMAZING. I'm very picky about wines, and she let me taste a couple before ordering the one I wanted. When a table finally opened up, the dinner service was absolutely fantastic as well. Everyone was so friendly and attentive! As for the food, it was by far some of the best Thai I have ever had. I had the calamari garlic. I love calamari, but sometimes when I order it in restaurants it's really tough and chewy. The calamari here was SO tender. The sauce was spicy and fragrant: lots of garlic and cilantro. I just wish I could have it more often! Especially for the quality of the food, the prices are incredibly reasonable. Highly recommend Lotus of Siam... just be prepared to make reservations or endure a bit of a wait!
Throughout our trip in Vegas, I encountered cab drivers of all kinds. Nevada natives, Ethiopian, Vietnamese, and Nigerian ex-pats and a fiery Argentinian abuelita [although she didn't look a day over 50] were some of the most memorable faces.. . Yet our driver on our trip to Lotus of Siam,  with whom I built the strongest rapport, was the most interesting of them all. Ironically, he was himself, Thai, and a former restauranteur in Las Vegas proper. We spoke of thai dishes, international travel and our mutual distaste for pad thai sauce in a bottle.. . At some point during our dialogue, I asked the lingering question, "So...is Lotus of Siam REALLY as good as they say it is? Is it the best Thai restaurant in the country?" To this, he replied with a simple shake of his head and a "No". "If you want good Thai food, go to Thai Town in Hollywood." He clarified.. . I am grateful to this man for lowering my expectations of Lotus of Siam, it's never a good idea to go into a restaurant experience believing that the food should be the "BEST" -- a recipe for disaster. So with a newly acquired, down-2-earth perspective, I entered the packed Lotus of Siam and prepared for a memorable experience.. . Ambiance:. . After the Travel Channel stakes claim to a restaurant, one of two things are bound to happen. Either the restaurant will cling to or completely abandon it's former character in the face of extreme "over-night" popularity. Fortunately, it seems that Lotus of Siam, while extremely crowded, has apparently retained most of it's pre-celebrity essence.. . It looks like...well...a family-run Thai restaurant. The only difference was an entry w/o standing room, a policy that reservations are lost after 5 minutes of seating time [if a "no-show"], and an elaborate walk-in wine cellar in the middle of the restaurant.. . Food:. . The Pad See Ew, Fried Rice and Mint Chicken where all winners; but the two dishes which stood out in my mind where the Garlic Prawns and Jackfruit Curry.. . Garlic Prawns: Full prawns, shells included, which where completely edible from head to tail. Crispy, moist and uber flavorful.. . Thum Ka Noon: This northern-style, non-coconut milk curry is made with young jackfruit and shredded dried fish. The curry broth was like none I had ever tried. It was a fan-favorite around the table for dipping, showering over rice or straight up slurping!. . So...who was right? Andrew Zimmern or my Thai cab driver? Is this really the best Thai food in the country? Clearly I am not qualified to answer this question. Yet, I can assert that the food was quite memorable and some of the best Thai food I have had to date. Additionally, their unique specialization of Northern Thai cuisine is hard to come by outside of Chiang Mai.
This is as good as it gets. You should add this to your top 10 list of things to do in Vegas. Worth the wait and the wait is long. if you want something quick go to a drive through. Drunken Shrimp is a must try dish.
The food was "5 star worthy", but I chose to give 4 stars because the wait is EXTREMELY long. I highly recommend calling ahead for reservations (if you can get through). The wine list is a mile long, for you wine drinkers, and the portions are a little small. I will say however, that the egg rolls are the best egg rolls I've ever had! Service was so-so. Andddd the last part is, it's off the strip, and you'll need a taxi to and from.
With so many reviews, I'm not sure I can add anything that hasn't already been said.  . . It I could only eat at one Thai restaurant the rest of my life, this would be the place. The Pad Thai is perfect, not overly sweet like you find at too many places.  The curry dishes have are more complex than I've had at any other place.  The shrimp are always fresh, good size and perfectly cooked.  I can't believe I waited so long to try the crispy duck panang curry - will never get chicken @ LOS again!  . . The service is not as good as the food - but if ever a restaurant deserves five star, this is it.
Nam Khao Thod and the Tom Kha is definitely a must try in here. Coming from Asia myself, I must say this is definitely one if the best and authentic Thai food I have ever had. I am so thankful to the friends who introduced us to this place. It has become our go-to everytime we are down in Vegas.
Amazing Thai food in Vegas. I don't think anyone can beat this place.. . Fantastic line up for wine. Great for business dinner as well.
I hesitated between a 2 and 3 star. The food is a solid three star. Value for your dollar is a big fat 1 star. Maybe I hyped it up too much in my head because of all the rave reviews and also the long line waiting outside even before the restaurant opened.. . We got basically most of the popular items.. Drunken noodles with sea bass, we asked for level 7 spicy and it had a good kick and the sea bass was very moist and tender with it. However, for almost an $30 dish, it was not very much  noodles and just barely enough fish for our group of 4 to split.. Crispy Duck Kha Soi (Sp?), this was a creamy coconut based sauce with egg noodles and crispy duck. I have to say, the duck was perfectly cooked and delicious, the noodles was good too, especially coated in the sauce. Again for the price of $25 it was barely enough noodles to split between 4 people.. The fried shrimp everyone seemed to get. I do love how crispy the shells are, completely edible and full of shrimp flavor. It looks like a big plate of 10+ shrimp, but it's more like actual shrimp meat is 4-5 pieces and the rest of just shell. . The spicy chicken wings were just OK, tastes like Costco wings tossed in the Asian sweet chili sauce, would skip next time.. We got the red chili dip, it was very smokey but that was about the only flavor it really had, not a fan of this one either.. Ordered a curry dish, it didn't have coconut milk and was another one lacking in flavor, didn't finish this dish because it just didn't taste like anything, just a lot of boiled veggies in a red watery soup. . . You'd think after 6 dishes between 4 people we'd be full but ended up having to order another drunken noodle dish but this one with just veggies. Sadly this second round was not as good as the first one with sea bass. We also go their mango sticky rice for dessert.. . Overall, some of the dishes were very good but not good enough to justify the price.
Don't judge this restaurant by its sketchy location. I really wanted a view of my car while eating at this place for that reason, but the food made up for it.. .  I decided to get a little weird and try the octopus salad. Tasty. Then, I tried bits and pieces of some co-workers' entrees and they were all delicious as well. Next time, I'll have to drench something in their yellow curry.. . The dessert I had was delicious as well. It was a combination of lychee ice cream and some thing warm resembling fresh toast? I really can't remember the name, but if you see the word lychee, order it!. . I would give the restaurant four stars, but the slow service brings my review down to 3 stars.
10 entree's and everything was great. My favorites were the sea bass and the BBQ shrimp, specifically 101 B. Make reservations well in advance.
Amazingly delicious! I am now a believer in the Lotus of Siam's hype! The steak tartare salad was awesomely yummy! The beef jerky was out of this world! Those two were my favorite! Everything else were scrumptious too.
Best Thai food by far in Vegas. Drunken noodle Seabass and spicy Thai beef salad is a must. You won't regret this choice whether you're a tourist or local. Best in town
We did have a rather larger group and attempted to make reservation. The receptionist was lacking in her duties. She made comments as "make sure you come, ok?" Put us on hold for a long time.. . As we arrived for our reservation, we got a little wait as a party before did not part ways right away. So we waited a bit. The hostess was trying to be as accommodating and upbeat as possible but still unprofessional.. . With a large group of us we got to try over a dozen dishes. Tom yum prawn was excellent. The best I have ever had. Chicken satay was ok. Lamb gai was ok. The toasted rice salad was great. Fried fish was good. Soft shell crab drunken noodle was great. Crispy Duck Chu Chee was amazing. Curry chicken bamboo was great also. Thai issan sausage was good. Beef jerky was great. Beef salad was good. I can go on because we came here two days in a roll. The food is very authentic and flavorful. All of the best ingredients.. . I also ordered fried bananas during our first visit. It was ok. The second day we came we had the mango with sweet coconut rice and that was fragrant and gently sweetened but not super sweet. It was the perfect combination of flavor. The Thai tea was also good.. . Our waiter was great.. . Overall here is my breakdown of what I would like to rate this place. The food is a 5 star. The hostess and reception area 4 stars. The ambience is a 4 star. I would have loved to give this place a 5 star based solely on the food but the phone and seating experience was not the best. 30 mins wait with reservations the first day and about an hour wait the second day without reservations.
Great Thai food. A bit expensive, but I wasn't paying! ;). . I don't feel like repeating things that were already said, so if you're interested, get in line early and order fast! . . My party was in and out in 30 minutes. . . Favorite dish was the Pad Thai, but the Crispy Duck Panang was equally amazing!
Meh.  Everyone raves about Lotus of Siam and I think it's good, but I don't think it's great.   It's expensive, crowded and loud.   I would rather eat Thai elsewhere.
Lotus of Siam is the only Thai restaurant I have tried in Las Vegas  so I cannot say that this is the best Thai restaurant in town.  But it might be hard to beat Lotus of Siam to be named the best Thai.. We went in as a group of twelve without a reservation and we followed the restaurants correct advice to arrive fifteen minutes prior to opening. To my relief we were seated all together!!. Restaurant is located in a strip mall with unassuming store front facade but once you enter, the dining room was expansive, . We ordered three servings each of six or seven dishes. My favorite was the steak tare tare.and the papaya salad. Service was courteous and prompt.. If I go back to sin city,  I will definitely go back to Lotus of Siam.
Lotus of Siam is a bit off the strip, and sits in a sketchy area. There is nothing special about this place, inside and out. After reading so much about it, and hearing Andrew Zimmern rave about this place, it was on top of my list for my last Vegas trip. It goes to show, all of the top restaurants aren't inside the popular casinos and resorts. Most of them are all commercialized and owned by restaurant groups. Lotus of Siam is one of one. It makes it unique and special, and is a part of Vegas as much as any of the popular resorts.. . We started things off with something exciting and new. The Koong char num plar, raw prawns marinated in seasoned fish sauce was a favorite of ours. With the spicy fish sauce, fresh garlic and roasted chili paste, the dish definitely had flavor. Ironically, I used a bunch of that fish sauce to get rid of the rawness and "fishy" flavor. Spiciness met sweetness from the shrimp. The texture of this was spectacular. A bit on the sticky side, the texture took some getting used to. Still a great way to start.. . My personal favorite was the Nam Kao Tod. It was a crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. Texturally different from the raw shrimp, this had a nice crunch, and the crunch played a great role in this dish. The ginger flavor popped and the citrus was key. It was delicious and refreshing.. . The dish of all dishes-the one to get here always Is the Drunken Noodle Prawn. Thick rice noodles are on fried with deep fried prawns. The shell I kept on and the frying process makes the skins edible. The special blend of garlic sauce and Thai basil was perfect. The prawns were cooked perfectly and the crunch of the skin was amazing. This dish is pretty hard to pass up -- a definite must order here.. . To end everything, we ordered the coconut ice cream with sticky rice. It was a great neutralizer form all that garlic, shrimp, and spices. The coconut flavor was mild and not too overpowering. My favorite was the sticky rice. Everything just had such a delicate flavor and nothing was overbearing.. . Back home in Los Angeles, there are a bunch of Ktown style Chinese restaurants that have pretty good food. From spicy seafood noodles to fried pork and beef dishes, they are all delicious, but you won't find any of these in China. The menu hasn't changed ever since the first time I went, and that is the quality of the places. You know what you will get, and its the same no matter when you go. Lotus of Siam is kind of like that. The menu hasn't changed in forever, and the food, though may not be genuine Thai renditions is delicious.
I saw this restaurant featured on Anthony Bourdains without borders and had to try it. We ordered only from the back of the menu for their famed Northern Thai food and did not regret a single item. We ordered the Nam prik ong, Nam kao tod & the Khao soi. The nam kao tod was out of this world I highly recommend it!!!
Well, the "American Spicy" vs "Thai Spicy" convergence point has finally been met. Spiciest food (I had the pork larb @ 7) in years. Be careful here, the 1-10 scale is serious. Good traditional offerings at the back of the menu under Northern Thai. . . Service is a bit surly, they're really trying to turn tables over here quickly.. . Mango sticky rice was the perfect end to a great meal.
Lotus sits in a ghetto Korean plaza away from the Strip.. And so I was a bit concerned until I saw the line of customers forming by the door before the restaurant even opened.. . The interior is much larger than you'd expect and much nicer than you would hope.. . The restaurant runs like a well oiled machine. Customers are seated quickly and orders are completed quickly in what I'd imagine to be a gigantic kitchen. Staff is also attentive and prompt.. . I suggest . Pad Thai - good. #58 - don't remember what it was, just eat it with the lettuce it sits on. Papaya Salad - fresh and strong. . I ordered the crispy garlic prawn as many yelpers suggested and was not impressed... . 4 stars because of high prices and below average quantity; will still return.
Best Thai food I had in the USA. Service was great too. Only take is they charged me %18 automatic gratuity when we were two adults and three kids. Although the food is one of the best I ever had, yet it was still undermined by their greed for money. It's a shame they did that. I didn't I object because we were late and they accepted us anyways.. . I will still go anytime I am in Vegas.
Yes, the location is a bit sketchy, lock your doors or park near one of the Bentleys (really).. . Yes, it's crowded and noisy, the line is usually long and they don't pick up the phone.... . And yes, it is the best Thai food you will ever eat! The food here will replace your previous perceptions of what good Thai food is, to the point that the mediocrity everywhere else will become unacceptable.. . Be careful of the 1-10 heat scale, it's real!. . If you don't like flavor and texture, this is not the place for you. Bland is not on the menu (except for white rice).
The 5 stars is based on the food alone, because the location and ambiance kind of stinks. But this is a place I almost always hit when I'm in Vegas. Haven't had a single dish that hasn't been fantastic. Highly recommend the Tom Kah Kai soup, which is just so complex and fun. Garlic prawns, crispy duck on drunken noodle, and northern pork curry are fantastic. Always get sticky rice with mangos and coconut ice cream when it's in season....
