Funny thing is, we went to a burger place at Mandalay first. But they didn't come to our table for 5 minutes to even say hello. And 5 minutes is longer than you think when you just spent 90 minutes at the MJ One show and you're ready to eat off your hand with hunger. So we left. And came here. A bit different, to put it mildly. Service was impeccable, but not snooty. The Missus and I both got different tasting menus. Mine was the Alain Ducasse 4 course one sans wine. From the cold broccoli soup amuse to the amazing lobster curry to the foie gras topped filet to the Armagnac dessert, almost everything was very well presented and tasted amazing. First time with foie gras. Would definitely have been beyond the pale if served solo, but topping the perfectly cooked medium rare filet balanced it's richness. All I know is the junk was tasty. The only misstep was the mashed potatoes that accompanied  the filet. They were served in a bowl separate from the plate, and surprisingly...basic.  . . Atmosphere was romantic, view was stunning, of course, and definitely an experience to remember. Not cheap. But actually worth it.
Save your $$ and find another restaurant because you are only paying for the lovely view.  I had the $36 salmon which was overcooked, dry mush surrounded by a florescent green runny liquid.  Very unappetizing.  Limited menu, mostly for meat-eaters, way overpriced, under construction inside and very disappointing.
"A Taste Of Luxury French Dining". Celebrated my anniversary here! This place is beyond breathe taking from the views on the top of the balcony to the decor inside of the resturant! Started with a maine lobster salad followed by the Roasted Maine Lobster "Au Curry" and the Surf & Turf Chicken and Lobster dish! Both dishes were absolutely splendid! I would recommend this place to anybody who is looking for a fancy place to celebrate a romantic occasion. The desert was complimentary from the chef which was a nice gesture being that they knew we were celebrating our anniversary! Some of Las Vegas's French Dining at it's best.
WOW! By far one of the best restaurants I've ever been too. The food was delicious and timely. The staff was professional and courteous especially our waiter, Randy. The view is one you will not find anywhere in Vegas.  It's unbelievable. A must go restaurant if your in Las Vegas. Great for special occasions! Make reservations right before or when it starts to get dark.
It might be fun as a club, but for dinner, eh. From the description I thought that Alain Ducasse was the chef. Nope. They just feature some of his dishes. I wanted our last night dinner to be superb and instead I left wishing I had gone to another, equally pricey place. I would recommend many others in this price range before mix.
While the food was technically good, there was a mechanical and somewhat stiffness to the experience that left me somewhat bored. For the price (unless you are a retiree) I would recommend looking elsewhere. . In my opinion, for the price there should be more of a "omg" going on.
This place is beautiful! My husband and I had a very nice romantic dinner here. We had the bigeye tuna appetizer and it was so light and flavorful( I am not a seafood person and even I enjoyed it!). The bread service was so fresh and served with a delicious home made peanut butter(butter with peanuts mixed in). He ordered the cod and wild mushroom side and I ordered the pepper crusted filet minion with fork crushed potatoes, every bite from all of these dishes was amazing! The service was wonderful and very attentive. After dinner we went to the lounge and enjoyed the beautiful views with delicious and strong drinks. We will be back when we are in town and encourage others to enjoy this place.
