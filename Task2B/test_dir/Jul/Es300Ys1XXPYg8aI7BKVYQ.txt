Bouncers complained about our cheap greasing, so we sneaked in either way, your lost bud. Vegas is obviously a money business, which is ironic because it used to be a family town with Circus Circus and the carnival WAY YEARS back. That just means Alcohol, Drugs, and $ex sells more than good ole Family Fun. . . I was too clumsy, walked straight into the pool, one of my leg was soaking wet, thats she she said haha.... They moved the BJ area to the center of the outside area, it used to be on the side near the entrance, the entrance now is now the guestlist entrance, and ticket and GA are on the opposite side near the exit. . . The atmosphere wasn't the same as last time i remember but at least this time the outside area is open!! I guess cause I went on a sunday last time. ( 2 years ago)
I really enjoy this club! I have been here few times and the ambiance is always good.. It is expensive but beautiful! Dress super fancy and sexy! . I wish it was a night pool party every night!putting the feet on the water while dancing and drinking is amazing!
As much as I like the opened space here, I found it annoying that I couldn't walk through the area at all. It was extremely crowded and I couldn't even get close to the bar. . . The pool area was nice. Some crazy people drank a little too much and fell into the pool heels and all. . . I personally did not like it that much. Maybe because the night I went we were restricted from going in and out of the club.
Tiesto on the weekend of NYE was a blast. I have also been here on a couple of other occasions and it was always a great time. There is a very spacious outdoor area with a pool, dancing space, gaming tables as well as tables for bottle service. The only con is that the indoor space usually fills up as the night progresses and people start getting pushy especially for a better known DJ. Other than that, if you are looking for a good time XS is hands down where you want to be!. . On one occasion I went through a promoter and was able to go to Tryst then XS free of charge. On another occasion there was a promoter who was able to get my friends and I into XS without cover and we were also able to skip the long line.. . Pro Tip: Try going through a promoter if you can to avoid long lines and any fees. The only con is having to get to the venue earlier.
The place to party in vegas!! The bouncers and managers truly know what theyre doing! I love the bar tenders they always take care of me well!
Pool party at night with Zedd djing!!!! omg i have never been to somethin so incredibly fun.. . We met a great man Mr. Vernon he was one of the secuirty guys on the guest list line. We waited for the rest of our group and he was super fun and friendly.. . After awsome vernon we went to get our ids checked and there we also tried to speak to a girl about being on the guest list. I say tried because this girl had the nastiest attitude she was so rude you would ask her somethin she wouldnt even look at you in the face. I dont understand how people with bad attitudes get job. Anyways we got stamped and she gave us a vocher thing. Didnt say anythin about it just handed it to us. No one in the group read it they just put it away lol...ITS A COMPLIMENTARY DRINK!!! Make sure to use it didnt realize till the day after when i read it!! . . Enjoy everyone this is really the funnest place ive ever been too!!!
Came here for the Sunday night pool party headlined by Zedd and had an absolute blast despite the fact I was sober AND didn't bring swimmers... (I'd been at Wet Republic all day and wasn't feeling it).. . The club is amazing in both concept and design with most of the action happening out in the pool. The staff were friendly and getting drinks from the inside bar was relatively easy because everyonewas busy partying hard in the pool.. . Pro Tip- If the line is massive you can sneak the bouncer some cash to skip to the front, definitely worth it!
I don't remember what DJ was playing that night let alone how I got in for free considering I'm a guy and I had to pay but that's a story for another time dealing with some really cool people that got us in..... . Good service at the bar cool crowd and my best memory here was jumping into the pool and all of my dress clothes. Shout out to that Club staff for being really cool. The feel and look of the club was awesome. If you're looking to do it big in Las Vegas I would highly recommend you come and check this spot out definitely when are the best looking clubs to come and party at!
Great club over the years but new guy at the front is a dick and won't let anyone in. Even with VIP and bottle service we payed for.
Went back here for a ridiculous RL Grime and then Skrillex B2b Diplo set. It got ratchet.. . Security and table wait staff show why XS is still showing the other kids in town how to run things.
If I could give it no stars I would. The drinks were watered down, the staff was rude, especially the people checking your IDs. All the guys were on power trips. Dude...you work the line at a club. You're not Secret Service. The only reason 1 star is even deserved is because the DJ was amazing. Don't waste your time here if you want to have good service and not be shoulder to shoulder 24/7. Way too much of a not-so-good time. Go to Marquee where it's worth it.
SUNDAY NIGHT = NIGHT SWIM.. . - Crazy, crazy party.. - EDM.. - Come in your bathing suits.. - Ride giant floating dragons, swans, sharks earlier in the night.. - Later in the night, only the beach balls remain.. - Towel table constantly stocked with dry towels. Yay. - Ladies, get on the right guest list and get 2 free drink tickets.. - Amazing energy and music.. - Best party all weekend.. . P.S. Don't book the first flight out on Monday morning to make it back to work in LA. Bad idea.
I had an amazing time at this club. Mostly because deadmau5 was the dj!!! He was amazing and made the experience so much better! My friend got us a table and I was so thankful we had a place to sit and dance. The club is pretty big. The outside really has no place to dance. They have a few beds by the pool but it was a little too hot to stay outside. The inside is very packed and it's only cool if you have a table. The dance floor is way too hectic for me. I had a lot of fun. Definitely will be coming back maybe for the night swim.
Went this past weekend and was expecting soooo much more! We bought our tickets online and we got there and it wasn't too bad of a line, we got in rather quickly. Once we got in is when things started sucking. We went straight for the bar when we got there and it was crazy just trying to get drinks. I got a workout just trying to get drinks. The drinks were expensive, but hey, it's Vegas, what do you expect? I got two drinks, so I didn't have to make the trip to the bar again. We were going to walk around a little to try and find a spot to dance, which ended up being a bad idea. There were tons of people trying to get around the pool and it was such a mess. And of course, there were some ratchets dancing right in the area where people were trying to get through. Seriously?! Go dance somewhere else, people are trying to get by. It took us about 10 minutes to walk 4 feet. I had people pushing me, I got beer on me, and I think in my drink too, because my drink tasted awful after that. After we got through that mess, we stayed maybe half an hour more before we were over it. Had a much better time at other clubs.
Got on guestlist and got in for free with minimum wait time. Probably one of my favorite clubs, it's huge! and there's outside pool area. Saw skrillex!
This club is gorgeous!. . It's a Vegas club, so you're going to get your typical EDM music played by DJs who just press play. But it's Vegas, and every club is like that, so just let it go and have a good time dancing to the kandi kid EDM. . . It's a fun time here every time I go. The club is beautiful and the drinks are strong. We always get in on a guest list. I recommend finding a promoter so you don't have to pay the cover fee, or get a discounted rate. So even with the free drink ticket from the guest list, the drinks are ALWAYS strong. If you're paying $10+ for a drink in Vegas it's always awesome to find a place that can make them strong. . . The club is indoor and outdoor. They are both very nice. The outdoor has a pool and in the summer they do a night swim club. The back wall that goes to the outside area is completely opened, so there's plenty of fresh air going into the club constantly. It's a comfortable temperature because of it. . . If you are coming in the winter time, they do keep it open then, which makes it kind of cold sometimes, actually. But they have a coat check for $10 and they give you a tag on a bracelet so you don't lose it! I thought that was perfect. . . I've heard that Drai's is even nicer, so I can't wait to try that one out next time I'm in Vegas. Either way, I'd really recommend checking this club out if you're here. It's a fun time!
Amazing venue. One of the best clubs in town. Great service, they read you're mind whenever you need anything. Definitely do recommend.
I bought tickets to a Deadmau5 concert in advance by two weeks and was then held in line for two hours with people whom had no tickets. The management holds people in line for ransom like slaves waiting to be paid off by frustrated club goers in order to guarantee entrance to their club. I will never come back here...To this club... To this casino... Or to this hotel. Pissed and still waiting!
I love this club, but their staff members are shitty! We went Saturday to see zedd and got bottle service. . I'm sorry, but if someone is paying about 2 grand for bottle service, then We should be getting what I deserve and that's including customer service. These people need to take their heads out of their ass and stop acting like their CEO of the hotel! Your a promoter/worker for the club, so quit with the bull shit! Next time they may want to think about how they talk to their customers that throwing down money for a table and still giving them a job! . They gave us a run around and when we said the table is under this name, they said to bad and so on. Well our friend came out to get us in at the table (since we showed up later) and when our friend told the guy it's under this name (which by the way that's what we told him it's under) the guy let us in. We told him, that's the name we gave you and he was talking shit back saying "i will kick you out and we need to shut up".That's great customer service!   . Like I said, love the club but shitty workers! Work on your customer skills!
This club is awesome!  I have been to a few other clubs in Vegas, but this is by far the best one.  The drinks are strong (and pricey), but the DJ, venue, and employees more than made up for it.  For how crowded it was, I thought the service was very good.  I will definitely be back.
Despite the incredibly long wait on saturday night, it was worth it. As everybody else says on there review, this club is beautiful. Its both indoor and outdoor, and get this, there is a huge swimming pool outside. There are enough photos on here to give you guys an idea of what this place looks like. We came in on a saturday night to see Zedd perform and it was one of the best times i had at vegas. If you're a first timer at Vegas like me, you have got to check this place out.
