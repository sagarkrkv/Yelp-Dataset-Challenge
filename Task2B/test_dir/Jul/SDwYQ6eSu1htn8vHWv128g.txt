Hands down the best wine bar in the Valley!  Food is phenomenal, ambiance & playlist is always great & the wine list is stellar & also constantly evolving.  We've ordered their bruschetta platter for parties & they're always a hit!  If you haven't been & enjoy wine you definitely need to go.  There are other locations but Arcadia is what I would consider the 'flagship' location.
Very trendy busy hot spot and for good reason. Yummy large chesse board with fruit nuts and bread, chicken noodle soup with real chicken and veggies :)
Everyone loves this place, it's always crowded, and their happy hour prices (wine, bruschetta, salad for $20 or something like that) keep everyone coming back. My fave bruschetta is their proscuitto one, just get 4 of those and you'll be good. What I don't like is that it's hard to get seating and there is a bit of an attitude with the staff, which is rare for Phoenix. Oh, and well after all, you're still eating bruschetta, one of the few things I can actually make myself at home.
We love Postino Arcadia and when we lived in Phoenix, we ate there all the time. The bruschetta is amazing. My absolute favorite is the fig, prosciutto, and marscapone but they're all delicious. We were there on July 4th and it wasn't crowded but the ambiance was still great. Service was so so (our waiter forgot my husband's beer multiple times and like I said, it wasn't crowded) but we've found the service to be really good every other time we've been there. I think it was just fluky. . . If you're only in Phoenix for a few days, I think Postino deserves to be on the short list of local restaurants to try.
Absolutely fantastic wine and bruschetta!!! I wish there was one in Denver!! This a must go!
I came here for lunch with a girlfriend last week and I have one thing to say:. . Errmahgerd, the bruschetta.. . I can be pretty picky when it comes to quality of food while I'm dining out. If I'm paying for it... I want it to be good. Anytime I visit Postino it never disappoints! Great atmosphere and delicious wine. Plus friendly service and fresh food. What more could you ask for?
Coworkers and I go here all the time for a quick lunch or happy hour. Great atmosphere, great service, great food.
Tuesdays are the best obvs thanks to their special. Not really a dinner place but great place to hang out and have a variety of wine selections.
Amazing wine selection AND $5 glasses during (a super long) happy hour. A great variety of bruschetta! My faves are the salmon w/pesto and the roasted red pepper w/goat cheese :) can't go wrong with any of the paninis either! The atmosphere is perfect for dates and lunch with the girls!
Postino is just plain awesome. We came in to great live music and a very busy restaurant and we were seated after a bit of waiting. The service is great even before you are eating. The waitresses and waiters are always very attentive and make sure that you are comfortable and satisfied. Because of the wait, our waitress brought us four varieties of bruschetta paid for by the restaurant! After we ordered we got our hot and delicious panini that were flavorful and perfectly portioned. The service continued to be great just like it should be with a private-owned business. If it were possible, I'd give 6 stars!!!! SO awesome!:)
Love me some Postino. The only problem is, so does everyone else and the wait can at times be excruciating. This restaurant serves up some of the tastiest bruschetta in town, which appeals to the masses. Seriously, it's hard for me to eat bruschetta anywhere else because of how amazing it is at Postino.. . They've also got some other good items on the menu like paninis, salads, and a variety of appetizers - I'd recommend the cheese board and/or the olives to start.. . Mondays & Tuesdays you'll need to get here early because they dish out the deal of $20 for a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board. The wait will easily be an hour if you get here late in the evening, not to mention the parking situation here is less than ideal.. . A great place for some casual conversation, a bottle of wine, and delicious food...but it's good to catch them at lunch or off peak hours when the whole neighborhood isn't in line to grab a table.
Oh. My. Bob!. . Two words: TOMATO JAM!!!. . I live in California -- The Bay Area. I recently went to Phoenix to see my best friend. She took me to the Arcadia Postino my first day there. We split the Bruschetta Board. My friend eats there all the time, so she picked the choices. I was 100% behind three of her choices and hugely timid to try the fourth choice -- the tomato jam. Let me say again. Oh. My. Bob. Words do not convey the splendiferously deliciousness of the tomato jam. Angels sang a chorus of hallelujah's and I'm pretty sure I had a mouthgasm on the spot. She barely got a bite before I horked the rest of it down. The rest of the food was great and the service was fantabulous but really it's all about the tomato jam for me. Tomato Jam! Tomato Jam!. . Now I'm back in the desolate tomato jam-Postino lacking wasteland of a place I call home and am jonesing for a tomato jam fix!  Best friend, shmest friend, I'm going to get my butt back to Phoenix ASAP just so I can have more Postino and tomato jam!!
This is one of three locations to enjoy bruchettas, pressed panini, and salads. I like to order the half salad and half sandwich. Italian picnic and raspberry chicken salads are my favorites. Chicken & mozzarella and the nine iron panini are my 2 faves.  You can't go wrong with any of the Bruschetta choices such as warm artichoke spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato. Come early to beat the rush hour of happy hour or you will be forced to wait a while. Come here on Monday and Tuesdays to enjoy the $20 bruchetta board and a bottle of wine! All locations have valet parking.
All aboard for Brunch!  We are a Sunday Morning look for a great breakfast kind of people.  Our best friends told us that this place in the Arcadia district was now serving Brunch from 9AM and to check it out.  We arrived like 9:15AM with much apprehension as we were the only couple in the place.  The menu was limited but looked decent.  Oh My Goodness!  My wife ordered the Ciabatta French Toast.  Now she claims to just hate Ciabatta bread, but she was not in the mood for eggs.  ***** That was the 5-star rating she gave the dish as it was (as she admitted) the best French Toast she ever tasted.  I on the other hand always go for the biggest dish, so I ordered their Farm Scramble - Eggs, potatoes, onions,  "secret"  herbs of some sort and two kinds of cheese.  It came with a  salad of mixed greens and cherry tomatoes.  I had to take the salad even though I don't "ever" have salad for breakfast.  I moved the salad to one side and licked off the fork .... The best tasting dressing I had tasted in years.  So I finished off the salad (that I never eat) and dug into the eggs ... Yum Yum Yum, I now have a new favorite breakfast dish.  You want a Mimosa to go with the meal?  Order  up.  We are going back this Sunday with our friends and I would highly recommend it to everyone.  A couple at another table told us that if we thought that the Brunch was good, we should come in for dinner as those meals were out of this world.  Oh .... by 9:45AM every seat in the restaurant was occupied.
I cannot say enough good things about Postino's !  I love the atmosphere, the wine selections, the servers... Postino's is my Spirit Animal.  Bruschetta boards are ahhhmazing!. Please visit and experience for yourself...you'll understand my happy speechlessness
I have enjoyed Postino's for a long time.  The Monday and Tuesday night madness are for those who have the patience to have a great deal.  This location is great due to the patio and indoor seating.  I've always enjoyed the prosciutto with brie sandwich.  Try to bring cash when possible for valet.. Parking can get pretty crazy.  . Service is always Outstanding!  Worth the drive and wait!
Good food, good service, nice atmosphere
This place has the best wednesdays in the valley! I love all of their bruschettas! I will always love this place!
The food and wine here are amazing. The atmosphere is so comforting, its a treat to come here. Oh and the bartender is wonderful! Super friendly and personable!
l love the bruschetta - sometime I will just get an order to go and eat it for dinner! . . The restaurant itself is really cute and trendy - I love the decor! . . I would have given 5 stars but sometime it gets a little noisy in there and a little hard to hear but other than that it is a fantastic place! . . This is probably not a good place for kids! If you want to bring your kids to go LGO!
