Worst hotel in Vegas. Not because this property is older or not as nice as other Vegas hotels, but because management does not value the customers or it's hotel. Here's why it's terrible: . . 1) Customer service. We booked the FabDeluxe room on hotels.com mainly because the Flamingo is known for its wonderful pools. My sister is under 21 and the website did not clarify that there is only one small wading pool for people under 21. When we went to talk to management about this misleading information, the manager Ryan Ramsey was rude and stared blankly at me the whole time. He said that he would get us a pass to swim at Caesar's Palace but never did and wouldn't return our phone calls. We ended up checking out of the hotel the next day because it was 108 degrees and we just wanted to swim in a nice pool. It's just so disappointing that the Flamingo doesn't care about satisfying their customers. . . 2) Dirty. It's one thing if the hotel is old, it's another thing if it is dirty. There was tape on the ceiling of our hotel room. The shower had hair in it. The pillows smelled terrible. The carpet was disgusting. The elevators didn't work and had graffiti in them. Terrible. I've stayed in 1 and 2 star hotels in Vegas that were cleaner. . . 3) Check-in. Took forever and we ended up having to wheel our luggage through the hotel to get to the lobby then back through another part of the hotel to get to the elevators. Terrible design. Why would you have guests wheeling luggage over multiple flights of stairs?. . 4) Food. We had tickets for the buffet which was pretty good, except one of the chairs at our table had vomit-looking stains on it. Everything was broken and needed updating. Which is fine, but they clearly have no pride in their hotel. . . 5) Noise. I heard the person above me sneeze all night long and the shower dripped water. . . Ultimately, this hotel is going down hill. There is no pride in ownership of this place. Everyone that works there looks unhappy and are not very pleasant to talk to. The exception to this was Fran at the front desk. She was pleasant. It's apparent the Flamingo doesn't care about its guests. The hotel has made no effort to maintain itself or keep up with a changing Las Vegas. My thought is that they are going to close within the the next few years and the owners are trying to get a couple more bucks out of it in the meantime. I would recommend any other hotel in Vegas. I even stayed in the Palace Station once and it was 50x better than this place. Avoid the Flamingo! They treat you like scum!
I recently stayed in a "Go" room. Sweet!!! Staff was wonderful. Especially the cleaning crew on the 19th floor. Room was facing the strip and the view was breathtaking!!! Room was super clean and the bed was super comfortable. Highly recommend the "Go" room. Saw somebody in the next row win $1,450 on the Wicked Winning machine. Donny and Marie show I saw two years ago is fun filled and great for all ages. Saw Celine this time, just across the street. If you're a winner; treat yourself at Ruth's Chris steakhouse at Harrahs. Pricey; but we all enjoyed it(-:
Finally stayed here on a trip at the end of June, 2014.  Overall it was an OK experience.. . CHECK-IN/FRONT DESK - 5 Stars. Our flight landed at McCarran at 7:30am local time, so we were at the Flamingo by 8:15 with probably no chance of our rooms being ready.  However, we decided to check an.  The lady at the front desk was very polite, and offered to have us 'automatically' checked in as soon as our room was available.  She advised us to return to the front desk anytime after 2pm to pick up our room keys, which was nice because this was a separate line from check-in.  So upon returning approx 3pm, I waited a minute or two in a very short short 'keys only' line, picked up our room keys and I was on my way.. . HOTEL ROOM - 2 Stars. FYI, we did not stay in an upgraded 'GO' room. For the most part, the room was nice and probably should get 3 to 3.5 stars, but since the bathroom seemed really outdated and was obviously not re-done with the room itself, I'm unfortunately giving it only 2 stars.  As for the beds, desk, misc. furniture and the TV, those all seemed pretty nice, and the floor was not carpeting which took me by surprise.  It was actually a fake wood (laminate?), which seems to be easier for cleaning purposes.  ON A SIDE NOTE:  The corridors/hallways and elevators in our tower were really, really really outdated and need to be upgraded badly.. . CASINO - 4 Stars. FYI, I'm including the Margaritaville Casino in with this review.  Overall the casino is nice, and you have the infamous 'Flamingo' fragrance that is always pumped throughout the casino, which I actually like.  You can usually find lower table limits here compared to Caesars across the street or the Cromwell next door.  There are always $5 blackjack tables inside Margaritaville and the main Flamingo casino itself has a variety of table games with lower limits, even on the weekends and in the evenings.  Also have a variety of slot machines, which I like as well.  While the decor in the casino may seem 'outdated', I don't think it really is.  It still has that vintage Vegas feel and look to it.. . DINING - 2 Stars. Ok, this is where the Flamingo could step up it's game a bit.  Carlos' and Charlie's is a smaller chain and not unique to Vegas so I've opted to steer away from there.  The Buffet could use some work as well.  Went there for breakfast twice on my past two visits and it was not good at all.  The selection was very limited (didn't even have pancakes) and the food wasn't the best of quality.  Want a better buffet?  Check out Harrah's down the street.  And as for the Cafe' at the Flamingo, I've eaten here once and the service was horrible and the food was very bland and tasteless and took forever to come out.  Even if I stay at the Flamingo again, I will not be dining here.. . BARS -  4 Stars  . Ok, for starters the casino bars are average, just a few bars in the middle of the casino.  But what I do like to give this area 4 stars is Margaritaville, the 5 O'Clock Somewhere Bar inside the Margaritaville Casino, and the Corner Bar which is located outside on the southwest corner of the building (right by the Cromwell casino entrance).  The corner bar offers up $3 Miller Lite Pints everyday (16oz aluminum cans), all day, which is really cheap on the strip now that Bill's and the original O'Shea's are gone.  Not a lot of nightlife here, but The Flamingo does have a few good spots to grab a drink. . . SPORTS BOOK -  2 Stars  . The Sports Book at the Flamingo is really small and sits next to Carlos' and Charlie's.  Definately not one of the Sports Books I would prefer to catch a game in.  While it's clean and looks decent, I would just prefer a larger sports book such as the one at TI, The Mirage or my favorite, Caesars Palace.. . POOL - 5 Stars. Ok, behind The Mirage and Caesars, The Flamingo has my third favorite pool in Vegas.  I especially like that they have an over 21 pool where no kids are allowed.  And the partying doesn't kick in until later in the afternoon, so if you want a nice relaxing swim without kicking and screaming kids, head to the Flamingo Go Pool.  The family pool is also nice with a few small water slides added to it.. . STAFF - 5 Stars. Overall, the staff in general (front desk, casino, restaurant/bars, housekeeping) are great and deserve 5 stars.
Came here for a show. But, spent time on the machines and walking around. You sure can tell that it is aging and needs to be spruced up. The smell of old smoke and some of the chairs you sat on were torn.. The bathroom for the ladies and men were filthy. Such a shame. I hope they start to fix it up
This lounge is geared towards Flamingo's players with 7 Stars and Diamond status. The lounge is located on the first floor next to the Ventuno Ristorante & Cafe. The lounge serves complimentary drinks and food. The food would be more like finger foods with hot items served at a certain time. Staff is friendly and very helpful.
The go deluxe rooms are great. However we stayed in the 'updated' rooms this weekend and they certainly were not the same. . The bathroom was tiny and you could not get out of the shower if the bathroom door was open or sit on the toilet with the bathroom door open. The shower was very narrow and the shower curtain constantly touched you while in the shower due to the narrowness. The sink leaked and the grout was molding.. Definitely needed some serious updating.. The pillows were very hard and old.. . The walls were very thin and could hear every thing and one go by, including the people staying next to us. We used the 'spa elevators' to access our rooms and there was ALWAYS a huge line to get to them. Why?. The carpet in the hallways were oversized and rippling so it was impossible to roll our luggage on. Definite accident waiting to happen.. . The only reason we stay at the flamingo is for the pool and the over all location. We do not eat anywhere downstairs (except the new pizza place that replaced the $2 burger place) or gamble anywhere in the casino.. We will only stay at the flamingo again if it is in the go deluxe.. . Pool and Go deluxe get 5 stars.
I am bumping this to two stars because I did get an upgrade while there. I stayed at the Flamingo June 2014 for 4 nights for a conference for work. Checking in was an ordeal, but not entirely their fault. When I finally got into one of their "updated rooms" I was shocked. The bathroom is always the first thing I check out in a hotel room and the bathroom in this room was horrible. I have stayed in hotels in third world countries with better bathrooms. . . I will say that the nasty room that I was in for the first two nights had an incredibly comfortable bed and pillows, they were actually better in the cheap room than they were in the upgraded room.. . Another positive was that their cleaning staff does a good job. I stayed at another hotel after I left the Flamingo and they had a horrible maid service and everything just felt dirty. The Flamingo is an older hotel but you can tell they've been cleaning up messes for years. So my hats off to them for that. . . The third morning I was there my friend went to retrieve something from the closet and the whole closet mirror/door fell on top of her. She tried to put it back together but found that it had been duct taped together!!! After two nights of being directly above one of the bars and getting NO sleep because of the bumping base well into the wee hours of the morning. The closet falling on my friend was the straw that broke the camels back. We had to be at our conference at 7 am most days so it was rough not to have quiet until 3 or 4 am and having people run through the halls at 5 am who had been partying all day scream WOOOOO!!!! VEEEGGGASSS!!! Not the classiest bunch of people were staying there when I was there. . . The front desk people were very kind to us and got us into another room that had a great view and was much nicer and quieter than the other one. The only problem with that room was that our door wouldn't close properly. I was scared to death and thankful when I heard a knock on my door around 1 am. It was a security guard who let me know that my door was not shut and was stunned to see that no one had noticed the door malfunction. . . All in all I loved the location (in the heart of the strip) and it was a very laid back hotel. I think if you were a kid who wanted to party cheaply it would be fun, but for a professional person there on business it was awful the first couple nights. The pool is def a party pool, but if you don't like a whole bunch of 21 year olds rubbing all over each other drunk with a loud DJ its not for you, but it is VERY Vegas! If it  was on my dime I wouldn't stay there again.
Old school all the way. The first hotel on the Strip in Las Vegas. Built 1947. Only hotel in Vegas named after a bird with thin legs. Enjoyed seeing an audience in shorts and flip flops. Class, baby, class. The only people in jackets here are the car parkers. Extensive remodeling going on. New duct tape on the carpeting. I love this place.
My stay was waaay better than I anticipated from all the reviews I read before I went for 5 nights.. . The room I had was a strip view facing the Ceasar's hotel. Best view ever for the 4th of July fireworks show. Wowzer. . . The room was nice enough, especially for the price. The only complaint I have is I swear I could smell weed come throught the AC vent fromtime to time.. . The faux wood floor was a little dirty but it's Vegas. Oh well.. . The elevators int he hotel are a straight trip to ride and at times we got off and switched. lol.. . The pool is very cool and I've heard one of the nicest to party at in Vegas. Lots of free chairs and the poolside beds are only $118 on non-holiday days, with 5 free beers and 5 free waters. Sweet. Unlimited towels are nice and three bar areas.
I really want to give Flamingo 5 stars. This is my third stay here in three years. . . I've been patient and stayed through the renovations and mess in previous years. I've recommended the hotel to anyone I know who was coming to Vegas. . . The rooms are clean, casino is safe and friendly, room service is efficient, hotel staff are professional. The lobby is bright, clean and happy!. . But the parking. OH GOD, THE PARKING. . . The self-parking carpark is multi-level but the first three levels are for valet only. Every time I try to park after 11pm, I have trouble finding a lot. The carpark is dark and narrow and full of blind spots. . . So I valet. . . But after 11pm, the valet service gets full and only accepts Total Rewards 7 star something or other members only. No luck even if you are a hotel guest. HOTEL GUEST!. . Now I have to go into the full carpark and get into all kinds of trouble only to find that the carpark is still full. And have to park at an "over-flow" carpark much further away. . . So angry. . . So so angry.
I checked in to the Flamingo for a few days for the 4th July Holiday. I gamble in many venues. If you want to have fun and gamble at the same time go to the Keno Parlor, my favorite. Traci and her friends are fun and professional at the same time. You even have fun when you lose. But there is an older gentleman there as a writer who needs to be soaked in warm water for six hours or so he loosens up and talks. I have been going there for many years and was saddened to hear that Robbin passed away and Mickey retired. Can't wait to get back
Cold showers. Took maintenance almost 2 hours to reply. (Not her fault she got call 1.5 after we complained) traveling here, no one has 2 hours to sit around and wait. . Filthy room. Full on disappointed. Staff not very helpful in fixing anything. They brush you off to the next person. All and all a total disaster. 250$ for a room here? Sheez. Never again! . . Oh and drips of some sort on our bed skirt. Yikes. Nothing like it looks online. . . Gross!
This is a very decent hotel for the price and location.  It's almost right on the strip and very close to the main attractions.  We stayed here mid June during EDC week - four nights for $440 is not bad!  The room was very clean, although not new and remodeled like the website confirmation promised.  The bathroom was a bit dated with old yellow tile floors and an ugly bath tub, but still very clean.  There's a food court in the hotel with fast food and pizza.  The pizza at the food court is a bit pricey, and I recommend getting pizza at the place right next to the elevators.  One slice is HUGE and they're pretty good.  . . My main complaints are that it can get pretty loud during the day from the Drais pool party right next door and that you have to wait a lonnnnggg time for the elevators.  . . I would definitely consider staying here again the next time I'm in Vegas.
My boyfriend and I stayed at the Flamingo this past weekend and we loved it! I had stayed there in the past in the standard room and it was okay. I did not like how thin the walls were and could hear EVERYTHING happening next door. This time I booked the Go room and it was well worth it. Agoda had a deal for only 30 bucks more and I thought why not? The room was super clean and modern. Everything was brand new. There was a shower with side jets and a separate bath tub. The walls were pink/white and the ceiling had a fun pink lighting with a mirror. The mirror in the bathroom had a tv in it. This went along with the flat screen in the bedroom. So in other words, hearing the lebron NBA news was not an issue! Our friends stayed a few floors down in the regular room and it's nice, just not as new. The bathroom is half the size. The view was just as great though. The entire hallway smelled like pee unfortunately on their floor. It was gross when you got off the elevator. The hallways on their floor were crap and did not match what the room entailed. (Which was way better). Overall having the upgrade was fun and you got a daily 20$ food & beverage credit. The pool at the flamingo is so much fun too!! It's free for guests and great since it's so hot and had an awesome Dj. Definitely recommend booking!
- LOCATION is the only saving grace for this place.. - We checked in 10am and had to pay a $30 early check in fee. . - The main room was semi renovated with update floors but the furniture was dated and the bed squeaky. . - Bathroom was super tiny. - The shower pressure was like a fire hose.. - Hairdryer cord torn and taped with scotch tape... coincidentally it did not work.. - The shuttle pick up/drop off was far from the entrance.. - We were suppose to get $20 a day food & beverage credit, but the hotel did not tell us of this during check in.
I'm sure at some point this hotel was the jam. It still remains a little gem but it appears a bit outdated.  I enjoyed the ambiance and beach decor. The attendants at the cashier and digital roulette table were all very friendly.The music was also enjoyable if you like 80's,  90's, and early 2000's music. While outside you can enjoy pretty views of cascades, koi, flamingo, ducks, and pelicans.  This resort seems family-friendly and affordable.
I booked 14 rooms in this hotel for a family reunion and I can tell you, they haven't done NEARLY enough to upgrade the hotel. They tried to charge my family far more than the agreed on price and even locked a family member out of her room, then tried to charge her nearly $100 more for her room than she was suppose to pay!. The room we had was suppose to be UPgraded, it was anything BUT upgraded. The sheets had stains on them. The room wasn't cleaned when we came in at 9P.M., so we had to call for a cleaning. I would heartily recommend paying more across the street or staying in one of the off-strip hotels. This place was not good, and the clerk at the desk was rude and obstinate. I wanted to be with my family on the same floor and she put me on a different floor, right after I said "oh I want to be with the family!" Wow! No way I will ever go there again.
Rooms are relatively cheaper compared to the other nicer hotels on the strip.  Definitely nicer than ones like Hooters and Best Western (quite significantly so) but looks like doodoo compared to places like The Cosmopolitan (pretty expected).. . Rooms were generally well furnished - we had the 2 queen bedroom.  It came with a 32" lcd tv, a single seat couch, and a small table.  The floors were also laminated hardwood floors.  However, it did not come with a minifridge.... . We were in the smokers' room and it smelled pretty terrible.  Like constant burnt marshmallow (the smell you get once you go beyond the toasty marshmallow aroma...not nice).  The smokers' room at Hooters was surprisingly odor free (although the place had burnt marks all over the carpet).  . . The main problem I had with this place was the lack of soap and hygiene products left by the housekeeper.  They gave a small vial of shampoo (which didn't really lather...strange...), small bottle of lotion, a small bar of facial soap, and a small bar of body soap.  I don't mind sharing the vial of shampoo and lotion but if I opted to stay in a room with 2 separate beds, it is pretty reasonable to assume that I do not want to share the same bars of soap with whoever I am staying with.  Why would I wash my crotch with the same bar of soap my friend washed his crotch with and then proceeded to wash his face with afterwards?  That would almost be giving an indirect.....nevermind. . . The pool is quite nice with a waterfall and EDM music playing in the background.  The water temperature was also perfect and warm (probably from everyone's pee).  I will say that 90%of the men had moobs that were bigger than majority of the women there.  Their nipples looked like salami.....ew...sorry, too descriptive.
Stay Away from this hotel!!!  I promise that you will regret it.   As we arrived to the hotel we had a bell boy help bring up our luggage to the room.   finding out a day later some of our stuff were stolen and of course the hotel did not do anything about it.   It always take almost 5 mins just to get an elevator.   The carpet in the room was really sticky!!!  It was so gross.   Customer service really sucked.   I am telling you right now stay away....   pay an extra 20 bucks more to go else where.
I just departed Las Vegas yesterday. I am a plus model and came to LV to do a couple of photo shoots for designers. I have stayed in the time shares at the flamingo and thought that the hotel would be just as lovely. But I was wrong. The room was outdated. With minimal furnishings and wood headboards. There was no coffee makers. Which you at least get at a motel 6. The room was flawed in so many ways. Next the hotel pool closed at 6? Crazy. Especially for a hotel that is known for their pool. I requested information on getting a cabana and never heard back from anyone. And it took us an hour to check out because of the overlap with people checking in and out and they were not properly staffed. I am just very disappointed in what I seen. Especially things being so different from pictures. I come to Vegas often for business and pleasure and i just can't see returning to this hotel. So with that I give my one star. Thank you
If you're on a budget during your Vegas trip, this is the hotel to stay at. They fixed it up, so it still has that older vibe, but bumped it up a few notches. I've stayed at almost all of the hotels on the Strip. I personally don't like going all out on the rooms and staying in the suites in The Cosmopolitan or whatever because we don't really spend much time in it anyways since we're always out and about. . . Anyways, my boyfriend and I stayed in the GO Luxury room with a view for four nights, five days and they did not disappoint. We paid about $400 total - including the resort fee. . The room had a king bed (which was very comfortable), great view of Caesar's Palace right across the street, 32in TV, a gnarly mirror TV in the bathroom, refrigerator, desk and chair. . Checking in and out of the room was really easy. The housekeepers were really nice and quick with cleaning. . . The hotel is located right smack in the middle of the Strip which is really great - directly across is the Caesar's Palace, to the left Bally's/Paris/Miracle Mile Shops, to the right Harrah's/The Linq. . . Again, this hotel is cheap and better than staying at The Quad, Circus Circus..or Travel Lodge. I don't usually review Vegas hotels but I thought they deserved one.
I've now stayed here a total of three times, and have another visit booked for Labor Day weekend. I don't exactly understand the negative reviews, but as a Total Rewards member who plays at all of the Harrah's casinos, perhaps I am biased, since I feel I have been taken great care of at all of their hotels. . . Flamingo is not only on thestrip, it's CENTER strip, so the location truly cannot be beat. Walking north to Venetian, or south to Planet Hollywood is easy, and crossing to Caesars is simple, too.. . The one complaint I will concur with is the thin walls, which I noticed particularly on my February visit. We were in the room closest to the elevator on the 8th floor of the Spa Tower, and I heard that elevator dinging at all hours of the night and morning. I bought ear plugs on the first night because my boyfriend snores, so I didn't experience it in an overall sleep-disturbing way, however.. . Parking has never been an issue for us here, but we typically stay Sunday-Wednesday. We've won money, lost money, eaten in the food court, checked out Margaritaville, and at the end of the day, this is still a very nice hotel. . . Here's my only concern about some of the negative reviews, and should serve as a warning to potential hotel guests: what the heck are you complaining about? You spend 8-10 hours in the room, most of which are with your EYES CLOSED. Who cares what the room looks like? And just join the Total Rewards club already, so you don't have to wait in that huge line to check-in.
Wow! This used to be my favorite place when I came to Vegas. Stayed here a few weeks ago. Very old and tired looking furniture in my room. No more security at the elevators for guest protection. Instead, sales people trying to hook you into buying a time share. Finally, the buffet was just plain bad! Very poor quality of their roast beef, low grade shrimp and snow crab, horrible side dishes that were just plain tasteless. Very sorry condition. Only one bright spot with a caveat. The coffee shop is still as good as ever. Wonderful eggs Benedict, really good steak at a reasonable price, yummy desserts. The problem is that they are opened avey short time. Something like 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Their best place and they limit the hours! What a shame! Still, I really do not want to come back unless I hear they upgrade!
Arrived this Friday at 3:00pm. Check in took over an hour! Had private dinner party at Carlos and charlies for 60 family members. Came in for reservation to not have anywhere to sit. Our party was all separated then told we could not be accommodated for drinks because there was only one assigned waitress. The whole dinner was paid weeks in advance. Horrible service and rude waitress.  We then met a man who worked here that offers us 20$ unlimited drink bracelet which he told us they get paid for every one they give out. We then came in to after dinner club with 20 people and paid our 20$ fees.5 minutes later we were told we had to leave (no refunds) because they claim one person who walked in with our group caused a scene 2 days ago which didn't happen. So we payed thousands of dollars and got treated like total shit. Will never come here again. Worst vegas hotel service I've ever seen.
The pool is amazing! Here celebrating our 9 year wedding anniversary and relaxing at the pool. So much fun!. . Love Las Vegas!
The Flamingo - Hotel - Las Vegas-  is not what it used to be - or maybe it is just as it used to be... Twenty five tears old and looking very worn down... . I am attending a conference in Las Vegas. The PSUG conference is being held in the actual Hotel- if it weren't for that... I would not stay here... The halls are dingy, the registration desk was backed way down the hall, the cigarette smoke is thick...Everywhere. . The parking is inadequate and the carpets are all stained - nasty! Yuck!!!! . They did offer to expedite the check-in process IF I signed up for "Total Rewards"  club card... What a joke!
Pros: Nice and clean standard rooms, reasonable rates for prime Strip location, parking garage for guests. Cons: A little outdated looking compared to other Casino resorts and ice machines never refilled, parking spot hunts could last a long time, key cards always seemed to stop working. . My family and I stayed at the Flamingo on our recent trip to Vegas. They have a parking garage for the guests. It's free, but because it's free, you have to search for a while to find a spot that isn't a valet or reserved for Hertz or another hotel. The hotel itself is very nice and seems family friendly. I would suggest arriving early before check in because the line was ridiculously long. Check in took us about an hour from after we arrived. Once checked in, you will have to traverse the casino floor to get to the hallway with the elevators. Sounds simple enough until you realize that the casino is full of cigarette smoke, and you have hotel staff offering the passing guests information on various shows in Las Vegas. . . The elevators to go up to the rooms vary in appearance. Some are in definite need of renovating. There may be markings on the walls and doors or you may be lucky enough to have loose panels in the elevator you get to ride in. When you make it to the floor, if you are lucky like us, you will get to walk down the entire hallway to get to yourroom(s). It really wasn't as bad as I am trying to make it sound because once inside, the room is very nice, clean and pretty modern looking. My family was lucky enough to have a room facing the strip and I loved that about our room. The one thing that I did not like was that they charge extra for a refrigerator and because of opting out of that feature, we had to get ice for our cooling needs. That wasn't so bad until we realized that the ice machine around the corner from our rooms was never filled and so we had to walk all the way back towards the elevators to use the machine around that corner and down the hall next to the vending machine. . . Over our stay, housekeeping did a great job of redoing our rooms and even though it is one of the older hotels on the strip, I enjoyed staying here. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a reasonably priced hotel with a great location. (Oh and a side, our key cards always seemed to not work. Even after going down to the Keys desk and having them reset, one key always didn't work. I am not sure if we were the only unlucky ones to have experienced this. )
Hideous sums it up. Won't go into detail, too much negative. There are, a couple ok things about staying here, but not really worth a mention. Do yourself a favor and do not stay here. Plenty of other hotels on the strip to stay in.
I expected mid-level service and quality, but I did not expect the 1.5 hour wait for checkin at 11:45 PM. This place runs like a ship... A very slow moving ship that is understaffed and shows its age. The carpets were coming up in the hallways, there were holes in the bathroom ceiling and the buffet was abysmal. The pool is this place's only saving grace.
I honestly have no complaints. My boyfriend and I stayed here for three nights and had the best time ever. We had the Suite Deluxe. It was all we could ask for in a room. Yes it wasn't a huge room or suite like Caesar's Palace in The Hangover, but so what? It was clean, it was air-conditioned, had a great view of the pool and the High Roller, and so much more. Plus you weren't gonna spend that much time there anyways aside from sleeping and getting ready. You're in Vegas, after all. . . I will definitely return here again and again. I love you Vegas!!!
-I stayed at the Flamingo for my birthday with 2 friends and had a great time. I was able to check in early and Mario at the front desk was very friendly. . -After getting to my room was was in the habitat tower, one of the older towers, my friend used the bathroom an the toilet clogged, we called to get it fixed and went down to the bar, when we got back it had not been fixed, we called again and it turns out that we had to wait around in the room to get it fixed. . -The next day, it clogged again and we called again, they were able to transfer the call to the maintenance and they said we didn't have to wait around so we left. When we came back it wasn't fixed so we once again waited to get it fixed. After that we went down to the front desk and talked to Mario who was able to get us to a new room on the same floor but in a newer tower with an even better view of the Bellaigo fountains. . -Both rooms were very nice and clean and had plenty of space for the 3 of us to have our own space. The view is amazing if you face the strip. After the switch I was much more pleased with the service and accommodations provided for me. . . -The casino had many game options and I needed up winning every day I played there. . . -The food in the hotel food court area is sub par, the pizza was crap, no sauce and doughy crust, I was only able to eat it because of all the strong drinks I had by the pool. But by no means up to Chicago pizza standards, or even New York, your best bet would be to go to the Quad which is right next door and get food, or goto a nice restaurant. . . -The pool is an amazing time, no long lines and plenty of seating, just takes a while to find a spot because it's so big. Strong drinks and nice staff. I spilled a strangers drink am they have him a new one no charge. . . -Easy access to the monorail which is the only easy way to get around Vegas. . . -In the center of the strip and easy access to everything. Overall a perfect place to stay for your first time in Vegas.
The flamingo is one of the older casinos but it is right on the strip the pool was nice the staff was friendly. The room was fine it showed s little wear and tear.. What they need to improve . Check in was a nightmare almost 2 hours of waiting in line that is not good customer service. The parking lot is a joke they share a building with hertz and valet so not much space left we parked on the roof #7 the elevator stops on #6 so u need lug your stuff down the stairs. But it is right in the middle of strip so the location is the major plus. We walked or rode the bus (8$all day)
I grew up going to this hotel and wanted to try and start the same tradition with my family and son.  Boy oh boy has this hotel gone downhill....was so disappointed.  There were many problems:. . 1.) Check in took 2 effing hours, we didn't get into our room until 2 am. 2.) Be careful, you don't want to sleep on the side where the Cromwell hotel is...their rooftop club will keep you up all night long :(. 3.) This hotel is no longer family friendly, it's more fitted for 21 year olds.. 4.)  Was super sad about their new Go Pool crap, use to be open to all guests, now only 21 and over and more of a club now with super loud, annoying music. 5.)  Families are now asked to be shoved into their tiny beach club pool, so ridiculous and insulting for families.. 6.) DO NOT try to be in the lobby when the party pool closes at 7 pm...drunk people everywhere. 7.) The rooms are renovated,  but so ugly and they did a really bad job. 8.) Elevators are scary. 9.) The buffet used to be amazing...it's terrible now. . I was very disappointed and sad that we will no longer be carrying on the family tradition at this hotel...can't believe I wasted money there.  I wouldn't even stay here if it was just my friends and I, terrible.  So mad my son had to endure this icky hotel.
I love the hotel and stay here every time I am in Vegas. The buffet at the flamingo however is terrible. Food was disgusting and the place was not clean. I went right down the street to Harrahs buffet and it was so much better!!!!
Awful is the word, my wife and I visited for a family wedding and stayed in this hotel, we should have known the price was too good to be true..... . The room was in the dog friendly wing.....we did not have a dog..... . The room did not have shampoo or towels when we arrived.....we like to shower and be clean..... . The room had multiple stains and sticky things in the carpet.....we do not like sticky things on our feet..... . The room attendants took over an hour to bring up towels/soap.....we are not good tippers after 15min..... . Out of a dozen hotel elevators, only 4x appeared to be working.....we are not triathletes who can run up 19 flights of stairs with two suitcases...... . Would we stay at the Flamingo hotel ever again? We would not!
Went to The Flamingo for wedding.  First, valet took forever. When an attendant finally got to us (15 mins later), he called for a bell hop. The bell hop took another 15 minutes to show up to our car. Now, I'm standing outside of the car in 100 degree weather waiting for the bell hop to get to my car. I'm a good tipper and I tipped the valet attendant $10 hoping he'd get the bell hop quick but no luck. Anyways he finally shows up, gets our bag and I head to check in. I get to the check in area and the line is super long. For a second, I thought I was in line for a Disneyland ride. However, my wife and I ditched the line, got into the rewards line and filled out for a card. This allowed us to get into the rewards check in line. Turned out to be a 15 minute wait instead of 2 hours in the regular line. At the check in, I do the $20 sandwich trick and it worked! Got upgraded to a cosmopolitan suite!!. So we head to our room. Luckily the elevator in the spa tower worked unlike the other ones in the other towers. No elevator issues for us! Get to our suite and it is amazing.  It was huge, great view and clean. Sort of...we open the mini fridge and there's a left over sandwich in there. Looks like the maids forgot something. Anyways we call the bell desk to bring up our luggage. Guess what? We had to wait over an hour to get our bags. No biggie, we can wait since we're inside the room now. My family meets us up in our suite and we order 2 buckets of beer to kick off the weekend.  Surprisingly the beers came within half an hour. Not bad I thought. So we head to the buffet after we settled in and got our luggage.  Buffet wasn't that great for the price they charge ($30) or something, but we wanted to dine as a family so we went. I tipped the cashier $20 and she gives us diamond access and complimentary wine for all of us (we had a party of 8). The food was very mediocre.  For the price we paid, I figured we'd have more choices of food, but it was horrible. . Overall the weekend was fun. We were forced to use the under 21 age pool since my niece was with us but it wasn't bad. They still served food and alcohol there and we didn't have to deal with the over packed "adult" pool. So I gave it a three star since I got a cool upgrade.  If not it would be a 2 star review. . . Bad things I experienced:. Long valet and bell hop wait times. Bad buffet. Ice machine and soda machine didn't work on our floor. Elevator always had spilled beer or something in it. Long check in line. . Good things I experienced:. Awesome room upgrade. Shower had mid body jets and a TV in the mirror! . Fun pool area (non "adult" side). Great pool side food and drinks. Good place for slots. Won a few times. Pizza place stays open late and it was good!. Fast room service
Pretty much the worst hotel experience I have had in a long, long while. . . I booked a "Go Room" from their website and paid a one-night confirmation fee. The night before I arrived to check in, I called the hotel to confirm my late arrival and room availability. I was told the room I booked would be available when I check in. Added to that, I was told to use the Valet service as that was the best for that time of night.. . Once I arrived, I was greeted by a tired valet who informed me that only "Total Rewards" members were allowed to valet. I told him that I was not one and was instructed to valet. He, thankfully, took my car and only after I tipped him, did he offer the "Total Rewards" valet ticket.. . Waiting in line to check in took 60 minutes (this is not an exaggeration). Once I got to a Front Desk agent, they informed me the room I booked was no longer available. This is after I was told it would be only 24 hours before. I was down-graded to a lesser room, which was not renovated nor was a smoking room (as I found out in the room) which I booked. I tried to dial the front desk from my room, but the phone did not work. I had to call using my mobile to get a different room. There was a downgrade option with smoking available and that I would have to come to the front desk the next day to move to the room I originally booked. Additionally, the front desk manager (who, after 25 minutes on hold did I finally speak to) told me to come down to the front desk to get my new keys for that first night. I am the one that had to tell him to send a bellman up. . . After relocation, I had enough. It was an okay room and I didn't want to keep moving around the hotel, every night. Oh, and also, to add insult to injury they told me the would adjust my rate to reflect the cheaper room. Upon getting my folio, I saw they did not. Instead of calling them AGAIN, I decided to pay it anyway just so I don't have to deal with them again... ever again.. . In review:. Worst Check-In experience. Downgraded . Inaccessible front desk and reservation agents. Do not trust reservation teams. Hotel is NOT renovated. Casino floor is dirty. Elevators need updating. Double check your folio. World's smallest glasses in the rooms
I don't really have anything terrible to say about Flamingo. The rooms were recently renovated and very nice. The location was amazing and the price is great. If you are a pool person, Flamingo has one of the nicest pools in Vegas. They also have a great pizza place that is open late for those after bar munchies. My only complaint was that the age demo of hotel guest was a little older than my friends and I, would have been nicer to have a late 20's early 30's crowd. But again, that's not terrible as we could easily walk to other casinos to hang out.
Stayed for three nights July 16-19.. First we faced a rude employee at the entrance that told us that we were wrongly parked.... and told us to self park before checking in. This was very uncomfortable to carry 4 suitcases from the highest level in the parking garage to the check in counter. If he had any service-mind he could have told us to unload our luggage and then park our car.... but not at this hotel.... . Check in is a nightmare at Flamingo - it took over an hour...... . We had heard that they had remodeled the hotel, but it is worn again and do not have rooms like many of the other nicer hotels in Vegas...... The breakfast areas at the hotel is terrible and dirty and with worn furnitures (the leather arm chairs have big holes and rips in them). I believe everything at the hotel shows on bad or terrible Management and that they have lost touch in running a great hotel.. It is sorry because Flamingo has a great location and is one of the truly classic hotels in Vegas.
1) I am staying for 7 nights... During the weekend I had noisy neighbors, but manageable ones so I didn't say anything. Halfway during my stay they were replaced with a LOUD  group of girls. I Called security up one night after midnight and they never came. Tonight, I tried to get my room swapped and they wouldn't let me. Said it was too late... Even though I came as soon as I could to switch after work. So, now tonight I have to wait until they wake me up when they get back to call security to tell then to be quiet. AND THEN tomorrow I get to pack up my stuff, leave it at concierge all day and stand in the longest line ever to get a new room. I am really disappointed with how little they are doing to help me. . . 2) no free wifi .... I didn't know ppl still had to pay for wifi. And the service in the rooms is TERRIBLE. I could barely load anything while in my room. . . 3) bathroom: barely any lighting and no lighting in showers. The water pressure is very poor. The water in the sink doesn't drain well either. Clogs very easily.. . 4) cleanliness. Although the rooms aren't renovated, they are at least neat and tidy. The carpet outside in the hallway are stained , ripped and hole-y in places and aren't even connected to the floor. . . 5) also, the gym is connected to the spa and isn't open 24 hours and therefore closes at 7pm. So if you were planning on going after work, don't count on it.
so the room was ok.. we had a decent view of the linq wheel. the one thing i didnt like was to open our door we had to thrust our hip into the door to open it. the pool was ok filled with old people. the bartender made a mai tai that tasted nasty. there was coffee but no coffee maker. for the most part it was quiet. the bed was ok a little hard. im a huge fan of their shops. the lick candy store was funny. their gift shop had everything from hello kitty to condoms. im not sure if i would stay here again but ill check out the stores again. for $50 a nite it was fine. one of the ice makers on the floors didnt work there was water spills all over the floor no one cleaned up.. the parking here is a nightmare just valet its complementary. the extra star is for the stores.
I stayed at the Flamingo for the first time. I can't really compare this place to others because it was my first time to Vegas. But I will tell you about my experience. I booked a fab deluxe room with one king. The room was very spacious. The view was not that great which really didn't matter to me because I was hardley in the room. The bed was comfortable to sleep after those late party nights. All in all it was clean, roomy and comfortable. My husband and I say the x burlesque show which I recommend but you can check my review on the xburlesque. They have many restaurants in the casino so you don't have to go far if your trying to stay close. Advice: sign up for total rewards and book with them directly and they will waive you early registration fee. I had an amazing experience I would defenetly book there again. Almost forgot the pool! Its not a crazy pool party theme but it is a chill place to go. They have a DJ playing and dancers in the pool. And most importantly a bar! I hope my review helps
I just got back from staying the weekend here, (25th-28th) my husband and I as well as my friends stayed in this hotel to celebrate my birthday weekend. While we checked in we were worried we would not be able to stay on the same floor as our friends (whatever rep is available next is the one that will book your room) this young man Brian from Pittsburg heard our concern and walked over to the rep that was helping my cousins, he went out of his way to find out what floor they would be in. As he came back he notified us that we would all be in the same floor. I was soo excited when I heard the news, we normally have to beg people to do this for us. And the one time I don't ask we get what we want. Brian was extremely helpful he even offered us a sky view., which I'm sure is proper procedure but he wasn't pushy about it.  Check in went very smooth, thanks!. . When we got into our rooms we were overwhelmed! The view was absolutely gorgeous, the Go Deluxe rooms are so beautiful! And the bathroom was so fun! My fav color is pink & of course there was a touch of pink in there. Call me lame but I have never seen a tv built in  mirror! Wow! This room had it all!! . . My experience here was amazing, from the friendly staff including the cleaning ladies, bartenders.. Everyone was super chill & nice! I will say parking is a hassle. There are toooo many spaces for valet, and then the hotel only narrows it down for rewards customers. I was a little offended. So much empty space in valet but other customers weren't good enough to park there.  Something needs to be done about that, we parked in nearby hotels just to get to ours. If parking was not an issue I would give flamingo a 5 star. Besides that, I'm sure we will be back!!
This hotel was terrible. Checking in and out was a headache. Apparently they have four people working the front. 2 for checking in/out and 2 for mail and key pick-up. No free wifi, the pool closes super early, and the sheets had stains in various parts of the bed, there was this disgusting fur like throw over the end of the bed that looked infested with dust and the towels in the restroom also had stains. I swear that there must have been bed bugs in room 6021 because the first day we checked in and went to take a nap, I woke up and a few minutes after I had a major bug bite welt on my back! My overall experience was horrible and to too it off I went to Vegas to see Celine Dion at Caesars palace to find out the a few hours before show time her show was canceled. But I'll write that review on Caesars later. The staff there at The Flamingo was not helpful and very nonchalant about everything. I will not go back there and I might not even visit Vegas anymore! Just not my kind of place :(
Here the July 31 weekend... I pre checked in online and STILL am waiting in a very long line that has not moved at all. Why bother having an early check in when you still have to wait over an hour!!! Ridiculous it's now about 11 pm and I'm still here...
