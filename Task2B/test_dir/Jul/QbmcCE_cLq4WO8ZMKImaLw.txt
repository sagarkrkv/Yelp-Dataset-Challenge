More is more at HHAGG. . . Unfortunately, this loud, windowless, and fluorescent lit eatery focuses on quantity over quality. Their potions are so ridiculously huge that guests photograph their plates before they dive in. What they soon discover is that most dishes lack much flavor  - IHOP's buttermilk pancakes for half the $8.99 price are a thousand times better. I'd guess that 33-50% of every dish gets thrown out.. . This restaurant also prides itself on being guest-unfriendly by refusing to substitute anything in their dishes. For example, if you don't eat pork and prefer their chicken sausage in your egg dish, they're more than happy to leave the pork out of the $13.99 dish, but they'll charge you an additional $5.99 to replace it with chicken sausage. WTF?. . If you like to think that big portions equal value, customer service is overrated, and bad lighting and noise make for a festive dining environment, then by all means join the others here who agree! . . For those who seek out quality ingredients and flavor for their money, the ability to order what you want without getting ripped off, and a pleasant setting to dine in, then Las Vegas offers many more choices.
This place has HUGE portions. Most dishes could be shared by 2 people. I ordered the House Favorite Scramble with salmon. It was pretty good. My friend didn't like hers at all. The waiter replaced it with crispy potatoes with no charge for the Scramble. My mimosa was warm. I was with a big party, but the waiter made us feel rushed. If I travel back to Vegas, I probably wouldn't go back unless I was extremely hungry.
First time: I was searching for breakfast. I tried to go HEALTHY but for some reason most places in Vegas don't do healthy. . . I got some type of egg white scramble with two types of veggies the serving was pretty small but loads of fresh fruits. The rest of the food on the Menu was massive. Great place.. . Overpriced for the little amount of food we had. Food had no seasoning.
Walked in and it was pretty busy but I came solo so I was seated at the bar right away. And my food came pretty fast as well. I ordered the chicken and waffles. It was fried to perfection and the waffles had bacon inside! Only reason why I did not give it 5 stars was because I was expecting more flavor from the chicken.They give you a nice size serving that can be eaten from at least 2 times.  I would recommend this place to anyone.
This place is delicious, however, it's actually a Mondo Burger that serves breakfast.
PORTIONS!! Wow. It's one thing to serve a lot but putting out awesome tasting food is a plus. I also love that the server tells us our plates might not come out together bc they don't use microwaves or heat lamps. Fresh is king when it comes to food! I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken, which was a big battered chicken breast w/maple reduction, bacon, bacon mashed potatoes, eggs, and a biscuit. Chicken was hot, juicy, and flavorful. The bacon mashed potatoes I wish I could order by the tub, they were so good! Sausage gravy I had on the side was good too, could have been a little better but it did have large sausage chunks which I liked. If I'm ever near a Hash House again I have to stop in.
First place I wanted to go to for breakfast when arriving to Las Vegas was hash house a go go. This was my very first time at this place. I would say that this is one of my top favorite places! They serve big portions that could be enough for two ppl. Their food is delicious!! I love it even more because they give you a side of fruit which all breakfast Places should have. You gotta try it out for yourself, it's so worth it.
Our first time and it won't be the last. Awesome Hash Browns and Meatloaf. Mary personally made a visit to our table to share her meatloaf receive. Thanks Mary!
Had a take out dinner then went back and dined in for breakfast.  It was so good; I would go again.  I didn't have an issue with the crowd because I called ahead for dinner and made a reservation for breakfast.. . The food was delicious, and the portions were HUGE!  One dish serves more than 2.  For dinner, we had the stuffed meatloaf - would get it without the cheese if I were to do it again - but the meatloaf and the gravy were yummy.  For breakfast, we had the pancake, and wow.  It was so tasty.. . The service was a little slow, but that is par for Vegas.  It was actually better than most restaurants.
Really good. Long wait but was expected. Food took almost 45 minutes but that was expected as well. . Couldn't complain everything was great
Came here for breakfast one morning during a recent business trip.  Located in the Quad, it is a perfect location if you are staying at any of the center Strip resorts.  Seated at the bar with my friend, the bartender was attentive and very nice.  I ordered the Basic breakfast, which included scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, fruit, and a biscuit.  My friend ordered the bacon waffles.  We were both very pleased with our selections.  Hash House is traditionally known for their abundant portions, but in my case the Basic breakfast was just right.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the bacon was no too crisp, and the potatoes were crunchy on the outside and flaky on the inside.  Best of all was the biscuit and fresh mashed strawberries.  Delicious!
SOOOOOO GOOD! I couldn't have asked for any better food! The s'mores mocha was amazing and delicious! We also ordered eggs, potatoes, French toast, and pancakes. Wow!!!. . All three of us were blown away and we have recommended this place over and over! Will absolutely go back!
Everything I have read about this place has been accurate. This popular restaurant boosts a farm fresh feel with creativity and excellent service. My wife and I had the smoked salmon hash and every bite indeed tasted fresh and made to order. You had to wait a bit longer but the wait is worth it. The serving sizes are very generous and you won't leave hungry or disappointed. Come early it fills up quick!
I've wanted to try this place for the longest time. I didn't know it was a chain (founded in San Diego) until I was in Chicago and saw they had a Hash House there too. It's located at the Quad, formerly the Imperial Palace, and soon to be renamed the Linq. It was late at night, so when we arrived there was no wait. They are open 24/7.. . I had the sage fried chicken (2 breasts) which sat atop 4 bacon waffles, with hot maple caramel reduction and fried leeks. The chicken breasts were crispy and juicy. The waffles were fluffy and had strips of bacon within the batter. Large portions- each entree can easily feed 2. . . *Featured on Man v. Food
Went here late night (as in 5 in the morning). . . They didn't have their full menu at this time but you still get the feel that this place doesn't joke around with portions. . . This particular HHAGG is difficult to find but I will say that the employees here in this restaurant as well as the casino were EXTREMELY FRIENDLY. . . All in all, it's a safe place to go for a group of hungry people who are perhaps a bit intoxicated.
Less is more. I wish this place was better. I have been wanting to try HHAGG for a long time, but it never seems to work out. I finally made it on Tuesday morning and felt sick all day. It's carb overload. (thats hard for me to say because I LOVE carbs).. . The meal just started off on the wrong foot. I HATE spicy food, and I have a weak tolerance. I ordered the HH Original which is smokedbacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream and two basted eggs. All this over the biscuits and then over a huge pile of mashed potatoes. Reading this on the menu, there is no spice - safe for me to eat. Not so fast... when the plate comes it is decorated in a red sauce (which I was falsely led to believe was red pepper cream) and took a nice big taste of it and turned out to be hot sauce. It sent my taste buds into a frenzy and I really wish they would just garnish the plate with the actual red pepper cream instead of adding the hot sauce to the plate. It really ruined my taste buds for the rest of the meal. . . Overall, just disappointed. Not worth all the fuss.
I was a little disappointed with Hash House a Go Go. The portions - yes, they are huge. But the food was just okay. I had the chicken and waffles and really, neither were spectacular. I guess the novelty is being able to get them (and a huge brunch menu) throughout the day. My friend had the pork sandwich, which was unexpectedly fried. Everything was warm and delivered quickly, but nothing seemed fantastic. It felt like the appeal is huge portions and fatty carbs (and I do love carbs), but the draw of large portions takes precedence over quality.
Man the food is so good here. Had the chicken and it was off the hook. Friends had the burger and BBBLT that was in their words killer. You must come hungry and bring friends to share because we could not finish even a half and it was so good we wanted to just keep eating
Whenever we're in Vegas we always stop by at Hash House for some brunch...obviously we never wake up in time for breakfast time...but if you go at this time brunch/lunch, prepare for a wait.  It is always packed.  I always get their chorizo hash.  My husband tried their famous chicken and waffles.  Both are yum and very very large portions.  Seriously, one entree can feed 3.  Definitely stop by if you're looking for a good breakfast spot that is not IHOP.
We've seen it in TV and couldn't wait to try it. So in June when we were in Vegas we didn't just go once. We had to go again before we left town. Damn the food was amazing. The place was clean and mice. The staff couldn't have been better. If we weren't half the country away we'd be back a lot more.
One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Very curious to try as we've seen this place in Man vs. Food (I'm a fan of the show). Their portion sizes are really huge! I was only disappointed with their shrimp appetizer, expected it to be plenty as I know their portions are enormous but got only 3 pieces in a huge plate.
We went to the Sahara location. Not what I expected! My order arrived 4 minutes after my husbands plate was served. My food was slightly warm, but I ate it anyway, since I had waited so long. There was supposed to be Brie cheese in my eggs, there wasn't anything. The mashed potatoes were good, but they were cold too.. I was told a biscuit was on its way fresh out of the oven. I was half way done with my breakfast when it arrived & it was cold, so much for out of the oven!  The prices are high, considering the mistakes that were made, we will never go back. Especially since nothing was done about the mistakes.
Wow, they are serious about their breakfast here. Holy moly they serve them big and delicious. Got the sage fried chicken with waffles and it will forever haunt my foodie dreams. Soo good.
This place had great food, with huge portions-well, sort of. The waffle breakfast that my sister had came with a huge waffle (enough to feed two people), two eggs, and two strips of bacon. I didn't really see the use of a huge waffle unless you were eating five bites of waffle and then one bite of the egg and bacon. But that's just me, I like my food to be proportional with each other. The same thing with my pancake, two sausages (which was more generous than the two skinny pieces of bacon) and two eggs. I mean, who takes home half a huge waffle/pancake? Not worth the trouble..Needless to say, it went to waste. The food quality was excellent though. And our server was great, the place wasn't packed but we didn't wait too long for our food. Our server was friendly and the atmosphere was ok at best. The tabletop was sticky and it didn't feel very clean. Also, it is located in the quad, which had a terribleparking layout and most of the elevators were broken and the overall atmosphere was dingy. The quad itself felt tacky and kind of dirty to be honest. I liked the syrup and whipped butter was awesome!
Visited HHAGG ago go for the first time on 5/5/14. The reviews on Yelp were numerous, and everyone seemed to love this place. Although we didn't go at a typical busy dinner time (I believe it was around 4:30), it was still a 45 minute wait to get in. Claims of the huge portion sizes were not off base. We saw many huge plates filled with food go by as we were sitting there waiting to order. What was obvious early on were the trees growing out of each of the big plates food. These are apparently big sprigs of sage, so if you're not fond of sage, ask them to hold it.. . I had the grilled portobello sandwich, substitute the goat cheese for cheddar. Watching all these big plates of food go by, I was anticipating a large portobello grilled mushroom cap with the toppings dripping off of it, but this is not what I got. It was a puny mushroom cap on a typical grocery store 8-pack type burger roll and they put the goat cheese on it anyway and didn't add the cheddar. The Waitress was very nice and offered to bring it back and make a new one, but we had already waited too long and my husband's food was ready to eat. He had a burger that was very good, but to be honest I don't remember what kind it was. My mushroom was dry and I had to add mayo to moisten it up (not something I would typically do), it was ok - nothing I would order again though.
They aim to wow and they do. Went there with the family for breakfast, and it couldn't be bettered. Not your usual diner fare, although you could have that if you want. Huge portions so go hungry or share. Before checkout times the wait is only a few minutes. As we were leaving, after checkout times, wait time was an hour. Be warned!
Brunch to the MAX ... don't miss this place if you are coming to Vegas. We had a wonderful brunch here in July 2014. Everything was fresh from the kitchen and our server Brie was fantastic. She definitely went above and beyond and kept the peach jam flowing at our table. Our party of 5 enjoyed a House Hash - tossed with crispy potatoes & topped w/ 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit, Farm Scrambles and crispy cornmeal salmon sandwich with chili mayo, red leaf & tomato on a wheat bun. Food was amazing and the service second to none. Even though there was a wait it was totally worth it. Funny - we ate at another very well known restaurant for breakfast and the prices were the same but this food was over the top.
When we got there in Sunday am, there was a 45 min wait. A sign said to sit at the bar to shorten the wait time. So we sat at the bar! Within 15 min we were ordering and boom! We got served shortly after. Food was amazing!! Perks about sitting at the bar was seeing all the amazing drinks being made, interacting with the bartenders, getting a seat quickly and tv view. The food was amazing! I had fried chicken, mashed potatoes, biscuit, fruit, eggs and bacon waffles. Yum. The plates were enormous so fiance and I split it.
Wait was long but I expected it would be since it's always packed. Takes a long time to get food but they make it from scratch. Chicken and waffles were good.
It was our last meal of our LV vacation, and we decided we'd do brunch here. I saw the Man v. Food episode and was determined to try the Sage Chicken Benedict!. . It was a little confusing finding the restaurant.  The Quad is on the strip, but the parking was a little sketchy and once in the casino we had to ask someone where the restaurant was. We were told the wait was 25 minutes, but was seated in less than 10. . . My husband and I shared the Sage Chicken Benedict and the French Toast...MMMMMMM!!! It was a great combo. It was a TON of food, but we justified it by making it brunch and knew we wouldn't have another meal until very late that night. The chicken is tender, the potatoes were delish (my husband loved them), and the chipotle sauce was the perfect topper. The french toast was the best I ever had - perfectly done with pecans and grilled bananas...great combination. I didn't even need maple syrup. . . Our waiter, Scotty, was very friendly and helpful, as was the other waiters I observed. I recommend Hash House a Go Go and suggest sharing a couple dishes. If you have a busy day planned, this is a great place to fuel up. And the coffee is great, too...not that see-thru, flavorless, tea-like stuff!
The original one in San Diego is way better than the one in the quad.   The food wasn't very good at this one especially, the pancake I had and the eggs were over cooked.  Tried something different had the tractor plate thing and I will not have that, again that, is for sure.  This place is dirty compared to other ones and the staff is rude.
The waffles have bacon in them.. . Did you read that? THE WAFFLES. HAVE. BACON IN THEM. What the crap?!. . This place was so very delicious and absolutely worth the wait. A must try at least ONCE whenever you got Vegas. The portions are huge and that is an understatement. I would recommend sharing a meal with a friend.. . I got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedicts and a friend got the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles...heaven.
Lots of food-think about sharing.  Food is good depending on the item.. . Egg dishes have always been good.. Chicken and Waffles - excellent. Oatmeal.  Not so good.   The oatmeal came with unripe bitter hard green fruit.  Not just one piece, but all of the varieties.  Ordering issue.   If you don't have ripe fruit, just tell me and/or don't serve it.. Drinks are good.. Pancakes-many varieties - excellent pot hole sized.. . Service is slow, but friendly and the wait time is really really really long.   last time I was told the wait would be 1 hr, but 1.5 hours later we were almost ready to be seated.  Not worth the time for me.  I only went this last time because friends wanted to go.
Surprisingly below average. First expect a pretty long wait to get your table of corse because it is in Vegas. Second my wait for the food was around 45 minutes witch was annoying but in my mind this was gonna be the best breakfast ever so It was worth the wait for me. When the food came out I was ready baby!!! AND THE FIRST BITE.....hmm not that good. I got the grilled French toast and a side of biscuits and gravy. I get biscuits everywhere I go just to try everyone's and find the best. This place was not good at all very stale biscuits and cold gravy. Let's move to the French toast, I understand it's grilled however burned should have been the word it overpowered the taste so it did not have much flavor and they give you a tiny little maple syrup to cover 3 HUGE pieces of French toast. Only come here if you are already drunk, I think it would be pretty good then but so is Waffle House. Friendly staff though
Amazing! you must experience the hash house at least once in your life. Went to vegas this weeked, i told my BF about this place and we ended up going twice because it was such a hit.
Came here with a group of us for work based on a recommendation from another co-worker.  We were not disappointed!  Portion sizes were MASSIVE!  Presentation was great!  Taste was on par!  The prices were really great too...which was a welcome surprise on the Vegas Strip!  We got a tower of Fried Green Tomatoes to share - it was presented over a watermelon in a way I'd never seen before, and obviously fabulous.  The server brought us some biscuits and honey which were warm, fresh and delicious.  I got a burger and it was great.  One of our party got the Fried Chicken - everybody around us ordered it as well, he said it was wonderful.  . . Everybody left happy, full and with leftovers.  If you're looking for a hearty meal on the cheap definitely come here!
Definitely my favorite breakfast place to eat on the strip. I've been eating here for the last 6 years or so before when the Quad was the Imperial Palace. The staff from my experience is always on point. Not only does my server check on me, but so do busboys and managers. Service is always a plus here from experience. I have eaten everything on the menu from the breakfast side already and can't tell you a bad one. This place is known traditionally for their hash and eggs dishes with the side of fluffy big pancakes. The highlights here for me are the steak and eggs with the cheese cooked inside the steak, the breakfast cheese quesadilla. the fried chicken and waffles with the bacon cooked inside the waffle itself and of course the signature Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (Man vs. Food). All the food is flavorful because this place puts it's own twist to each dish. The portions are epic, definitely come here early eat, and take home your leftover for lunch. The official dishes here average between $15-$22 dollars for basically 2 meals of your day.  Located centrally on the strip. A definitely can't go wrong spot for epic breakfast.
They refused service due to my pregnancy?!!. . I must say I'm really quite sad towrite this review as this was once one of my favorite spots on the strip, but I will not be returning.. . I was visiting Vegas along with a group of 6 people.  I'm currently 10 weeks pregnant with twins, so while they decided to walk to the restaurant, I hopped a cab because I wasn't feeling too well and was in a hurry to get some food in my stomach.  I figured I'd arrive 15 mins early and be able to get a table and get my food order in immediately. . . Once I arrived, the place was dead (it was about 9:30 pm), so I asked to be seated at a table for 6.  The hostess informed me that she was unable to seat me without the remainder of my party.  I was quite surprised as the majority of the tables were empty.  I explained that I am pregnant and experiencing morning sickness which worsens as I get hungry, could they please make an exception and seat me.  No, nothing she could do.   . . At this time, I started dry heaving.  Now there is not a bathroom in this place, you have to go down and through the casino in order to find one, so I grabbed the garbage can from the hostess station and sat down.  I asked the hostess if I could at least get a sprite right now to calm my stomach?  She pointed to the bar and said, yeah, go ahead.   I was shocked that with NOTHING TO DO, she didn't even offer to go and retrieve it for me!!!   I rushed back to the bar and ordered my sprite (which they made me pay for at that time, instead of just tacking it onto my dinner bill - kind of unussual...) and sat back down to continue heaving.  . . As the dry heaving continued, I asked the hostess if I could put a food order in from the lobby.   No, not until you're seated (but of course they wouldn't seat me).  When the dry heaving continued, I asked her to bring me out a biscuit (they give these out for free with dinner)  which thankfully, she did and I was able to wolf that down and my stomach started to settle.    . . Shortly after that, my party arrived.  They alerted the hostess, who then spent another 10 minutes readying the table (seriously?!)  and finally sat us.   I immediately ordered some food and asked the waiter to rush it.  While the rest of the group looked over the menu.   While we waited, I began to feel sick again.  I went over and grabbed a small trash can and brought it under our table, just in case because the distance to the bathroom was quite far.   . . A minute or so after sitting back down, the manager, Shawn, walks up to the table "I'm sympathetic to your situation, but I can't have this here"   I assumed he meant the trash can, so I said "Ok, maybe you could bring me a bowl just in case?"   "No Ma'am, I mean YOU; you need to leave.  I just can't have you in my restaurant, it's disturbing to other patrons"  My jaw completely dropped - for one thing, there was no one else around us!   For another, I hadn't actually thrown up a single time and hadn't even gagged while seated at the table!!  I was completely confused - "the rest of your party is welcome to stay, but I'm going to have to have to ask you to leave"   At this point I felt terrible and burst in to tears begging him to "please just pack up my food, I need to eat before I faint!  I need to eat!  Please!"  At first he refused, but I think as the tears were flowing, he started to get a little embarrassed.  He went back into the kitchen and brought back a small plate of corned beef, dropped it at the table and then rushed away.   . . As I wolfed down my food between tears, the waiter returned and we asked him to send over another manager as we were pretty horrified with the treatment.    A female manager returned.  She did not apologize for the behavior or the other manager, but did say "if you'd like to stay, you can stay"  But honestly at this point, we weren't willing to patronize the place anymore.  . . So she brings back the BILL.   "you expect me to PAY for this after the way I was treated?!"   "well Ma'am, you DID eat it"   I should have walked out, but I was very upset and just handed her my credit card - $10 for by biscuit, soda, and a handful of corned beef.    . . We made a complaint to the hotel manager (The Quad) and although she was very nice and understanding, she stated that they did not have an affiliation with the restaurant and there really was nothing that she could do about how they ran their business.  . . Sadly, I won't ever be returning.  The lack of any empathy from the staff is ridiculous.  With so many wonderful places on the strip and every other experience this trip great customer service, this place won't ever make the cut again.
My God this place is ....I don't have word I am a Mexican American and my grandmother was the only one that can quench my pallet with flavors of my ancestors and this place is as close as a restaurant can get ...
I have been to the San Diego location and was excited for the rest of my party to experience it. We waited 45 mins which wasn't bad but before we even got the food we waited a total of 2 hours. I'm sorry but that should be something told to people about the additional wait time for food. We even all knew exactly what we wanted when we sat down. It made the fun experience annoying and boring and way to long. I didn't even care about the good once we got it. I will not be returning to this location.
Awesome place to eat, I warn you ... you have to go on an empty stomach, the portions are huge
Just a great experience all around.  I had the sage chicken and waffles.  It was divine.
Food is amazing and they give alot!  Very crowded had to wait over and hour but worth the wait.  This was on the food network thats why we check them out...  I have told friends when they go to vegas to check it out and everyone that did.. said thanks that place was awesome...  you wont be disappointed..  As busy as they are the food was terrific worth the wait!
This place is pretty damn awesome! We came here on the weekend and it was so busy. Weekdays seem more calm. I recommend the sage chicken and waffles. Delicious and the waffles have bacon in them! Our server Bree (sorry if that's spelled wrong) today was knowledgeable of the menu and had a great vibe. I would definitely recommend this place.
After such a horrible experience at Serendipity, me and my two friends stormed out of there and walked across the street to Hash House A Go Go. I'm really glad we found this place! . Don't let the line intimidate you.. as soon as we walked up the escalator, there was a very large crowd. I walked up to the hostess in which she informed me it would be about a 30 minute wait, which was NOT BAD AT ALL compared to other great restaurants in Vegas. Unfortunately, they don't offer pagers or take your number down to text you and let you know your table is available. But we managed to go downstairs for some quick gambling and came back in 25 minutes to check up in our table. Not too long after, we were seated! Very prompt on timing!. After we sat down, our waitress came immediately and took our drink orders. When she returned, she had her pen ready to take our order and answer questions. She was able to give us great recommendations. The location was very busy so I expected a long wait time for our food.. WRONG! It came within 15 minutes and it was beyond what we expected. Definitely love the food and concept of it all. . But what really got me to leave this review is the service. I was very shocked at how on point they are. Our waitress consistently came back and made sure we were good. My friend mentioned to me to ask our waitress for some jam and the waitress must have overheard because she brought it to us without even having to ask! BONUS. . I wish there were more stars I can offer because she really did an amazing job and I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Food was definitely cheap and affordable and comes in HUGE portions.. so make sure to come hungry or with a friend to share!
Warning: Portions here are humongous! . . I ordered a Sage Fried Chicken Linguine to share with two other drunken people and that was way more than enough food for all three of us. The mushroom cream was ok. Wasn't too overwhelming but it wasn't the best either. There was a good amount of it which came in handy when we tasted the sage fried chicken. The sage fried chicken wasn't hot to temperature and it was also super duper dry. I only ate a few bites of it and I had to dip it in the sauce with my pasta to be able to enjoy. I did like the crispy green beans that were in the pasta. . . Our waiter was very difficult to find. Find to place the order, find to get a water refill, find to ask where the restroom is at, and to find to get the check. The place is pretty big but wasn't very crowded that night so I don't know how that works. (Bathrooms our outside by Fat Tuesdays). . What we thought would be a quick bite ended up being pretty long. Service is slow, food is ok. Decent place to go for diner food and large portions to share with a lot of people.
The portions are HUGE the chicken and waffles where great... I wouldn't say amazing but great and huge. The chicken Benedict with the chipotle sauce was un-inspiring, HUGE but just ok. The banana carmel pancake might have been the best pancake I have ever had and brought my rating up one star.
What happened to Hash House? I feel like this location butchered the image of Hash house for me. I had gone to the one in San Diego, CA and it was so delicious. Ahh!. . Anyway, my husband and I came here last year, and it was his first time. After my raving, I know he felt let down by the quality, or lack there-of.. . My omelette and biscuits were so BLAND and my husband's dish (forgot which one it was) was not tasty at all either. Even adding hot sauce didn't suffice. Won't be back!
Just an Overrated breakfast spot in Vegas.. . They seem to focus more on presentation than flavor. The portions are big but the flavors are way off. . . Positive:. . *The presentation looked great.. . *Big portions for the price.. . Negative: The taste . . *There was nothing special about the waffles even with the bacon inside. Just Tasted bland.. . *The chicken breast had no flavor. Seemed like they focused on the crust and forgot to season the chicken.  . . *The scrambled eggs tasted funny. How do you mess up on scramble eggs?  The eggs Tasted very generic...it's  like they added some type of filling to make it seem more. . Me and my friend both looked at each other with disappointment after tasting it.. . I should have Go Go gadget my ass out of there when I had the chance!
Homestyle uuber sized portions! Check out my honey's tower of chicken and waffle! This was the best part of our trip. Was not hungry so I ordered one flap jack. It was huge. Could not finish. Sorry mom. Missing one more star because we had to walk in a maze to get to the spot -- but it was worth it...but then the wait was close to 2 hours! We snuck up on the bar patrons and stalked them until two people finished their lunch. That took about 20 mins, not bad. Also missing the last star because they do Not have a bathroom - whattt??
We were in Vegas for five days in July of 2014, and unfortunately only stumbled upon Hash House on our last breakfast. . We got there between 8 and 9 am, and were seated right away with a party of 3. If you have a larger party, or if you come after 9, be prepared to wait. When we left, there were plenty of people waiting, but the restaurant is huge so I don't think the wait was long. . The menu is small enough to not overwhelm you, but big enough to where it is hard to decide on just one thing. I had been craving a BBBBLT, so that is what I had. It was GIGANTIC! Tons of bacon (hence the more than one B) on thick toasted white bread. It was perfection. Served with fries that were just ok, but the sandwich filled me up plenty. They don't have heat lamps in their kitchen, so the food came out right when it was ready. This could mean that your whole table won't get their food at the same time, so throw manners out the window and eat while your food is hot!. The portions are HUGE and the prices are way more reasonable than anything nearby for the quality of food. Plus, if you are a Total Rewards cardholder, you get a tiny bit of a discount! I would suggest visiting Hash House a Go Go more than once on your trip not only to enjoy some delicious food, but also to save you money in the long run and fill you up for the better part of the day! I can't wait to go back.
Warning: set aside at least 2.5-3 hours if you are going to have a meal here.  . Me and a friend came here on a random friday afternoon ~12pm.  To our surprise, the whole waiting area is packed with people waiting.  Our wait was estimated to be 40 minutes so we went to play some pai gow downstairs.  We came back in 30 minutes and they already called our name.  Awesome!   . We ordered the sage chicken benedict to share, which the waiter admitted will take at least 35 minutes.  The portion was huge.  It was a good size to share between 2 people.   This dish had chicken, cheese, bacon, eggs, biscuits, potatoes and some sort of hollandaise sauce.  The eggs were scrambled instead of poached but they were scrambled perfectly.   . . Pros: new location inside the Quad, huge portions, siracha available, slow but good service, cheap.. . Note to self: try Sage chicken waffles next visit.
Initially, I was excited to go as the Hash House in San Diego is great.. . Yeay:  large portions, fresh and good quality ingredients.  I had the corned beef hash.  Hubby's Total Rewards card served as a speed pass, so we only waited 10 min when the regular wait was an hour.. . Meh: slooow service (took 30 minutes for food to arrive), the vanilla waffle was more like a pancake shaped into a waffle-- very cakey and almost soggy, I was expecting something crisp and airy
Food was worth the wait, but that wait was CRAZY! My wife and I got a "twisted" burger which came with 2 patties stuffed with mashed potatoes and bacon.  We also got the chorizo, jalapeno, and cheddar hash and the cinnamon banana pancakes ( which were the size of both of our heads). It was enough food for 4 people...Trust me when I say that we can throw down on some good eating. Can you say, "delicious-ness?"
Let me start by saying AMAZING! I've been told about this place a few times and finally got the option to try it. I ordered the sage chicken & waffles which was heaven on a plate. First let's start with the chicken it was two large pieces of breast that we NOT dry surprisingly. The waffle are the best they look like ordinary waffle until you cut into them...Full strips of bacon were hidden inside which made them absolutely delightful. The portions are big enough to share. I had the kiwi watermelon lemonade which you can have virgin or spiked. . . The kids menu is a downfall it's only for 10 and under and my daughters plate was way more than she could eat.
Stopped by for late night break at 0100 hrs and had steak and eggs. $14.00 steak and eggs were gr8t. Hollar..
My boyfriend and I had a great breakfast here. The vanilla waffles were super moist. It's noisy and loud but that's to be expected. It is Vegas after all.  You should definitely give this place a try--a great treat from the treacherous heat!
Let's just say this place is pretty amazing! It's worth the 45 min wait! The portions are huge you can split one meal between two people. I had a Farmers Scramble. Pretty good, wasn't a fan of them putting garnish in a perfectly good biscuit kind of ruined it for me. Makes your biscuit taste awful. Our server could have been a little better about refills and checking in on our table!
The best breakfast ever!! Great staff and service !! Large .. I mean VERY LARGE PORTIONS for your hunger satisfaction !! He there early though BC it does get packed during the later hours of the day and the wait time is not pleasant! I mean who could blame them.. The food there is that good !!
Came by for brunch on a Friday morning and the wait was 45 minutes. Keep in mind they don't seat unless the entire party is present.. . Service was friendly, but the food did take another 45 minutes to arrive. I ordered the fried chicken, mashed potatoes, bacon with scrambled eggs. The fried chicken was very juicy and the batter was fresh! The scrambled eggs were good too. The mashed potatoes were slightly bland.. . Will definitely have to return to try the other items on their menu. $20/person.
Definetly a must try!!!!! Their brown sugar banana pancakes were BOMB!!! Good service and good food!
I'm a stupid girl. If Man vs Food goes somewhere, I follow. He has led me to some great places, but Hash House is a no no.. . It's a novelty joint, and the portions are ginormous, but the food is bad. . . I has a few bites of my Benedict and called it quits. I have the eating habits of a 15-year-old boy and for me to stop eating something is a big deal. My plate was just a huge mess of flavors that didn't work.. . My friend and I didn't even get to-go boxes. . . Sorry Hash House, but I won't be back.
Come here if you are the patient and hungry type (read: not hangry). Wait times are ridiculous and can be anywhere from 20-60 minutes during peak meal hours, but if you manage to get in, you'll find out that they serve absolutely MASSIVE portions of EVERYTHING on their menu.. . With a name like Hash House, you certainly can't go wrong with their traditional hashes, but the thing to try is the chicken and waffles. Giant pieces of crispy fried chicken atop fluffy sage waffles drizzled with maple syrup. The enormous plate comes with a giant steak knife stabbed right in the middle -- it doesn't get much more epic than that. If you manage to finish this plate by yourself, I bow down to you. I scruffed through barely half of it, and I was already ready to roll back down the escalator in a food coma.. . I also hear that they're open 24 hours, so if you're craving a massive meal after a crazy night of clubbing and/or drinking, they might be a good place for some drunken munchies.
What a disappointment.. . Yes, I have only heard amazing things about this place, and I'm sure it may be true however, the service I received during my visit completely ruined this experience for me.. . I came here early on a weekday night with a party of 4, let's day 9ish. We were sat right away which was great, as I had attempted coming here three different times only to have to turn around due to the ungodly wait times.. . So here I am, on cloud 9 finally getting to try all of the amazing things I hear about HH.. 30 MINUTES LATER someone finally comes over to take our drink order. Another 20 minutes go by before we receive them. Another 15 minutes before we order and ONE HOUR before the food came out.... I'm sure you can see were I'm going with this.. I am a very reasonable person when it comes to dining out, and as I have been a waitress in the past, I completely know how this thing works.. . THIS, was on another level.. . As what takes the cake?? MY CHICKEN WAS RAW. . . I don't have words. After waiting over two hours for food, and having raw chicken delivered to my table.... I still don't have words.. . The server was very nice and very apologetic and did not charge us for the meal however, It will take a lot for me to try HHAGG again.
Open 24 hours, this is probably the best deal on the strip.  Depending on your appetite, you can easily feed 2 with one meal, and if I recall, the price wasn't that bad.  And the food was really good.  Sage waffles and chicken has already been brought up in several interviews, and it's definitely deserving of the praise.  Plus, seating isn't THAT bad.  For the strip, it's a great, great deal.
Not a big breakfast fan normally, but some of the dishes I have had heard are too amazing to pass up!  I have been here every time I go to Vegas and everyone I go with, or have recommended this place to, loves it.  I personally love the biscuits and gravy, but have also had the Man vs. Food dish, and that is huge and delicious.  Great food.  Perfect for your Vegas hangover.
Came here at 5am Sunday morning.  I counted maybe 15 parties.  I counted 5 servers.  I've never worked in food service but 3 tables per server should count as easy, right?  But for whatever reason, our server kept disappearing for long periods of time.  During our meal, the server did swing by once to apologize and explained that they are very busy.  Hmm, not very convincing with the majority of the tables empty.. . Two of us had burgers, which we both agreed tasted very, very bland.  Needed ketchup for it to be edible but conveniently enough, the ketchup bottle at our table was completely empty.  Since our waiter was nowhere to be seen, I had to go snatch a bottle from an empty table.  For my order, I opted for a salad rather than the usual french fries.  The server did not ask what dressing I would like, and the salad was given to me without dressing.  When I realized this, the waiter had already disappeared and I was not given an opportunity to ask him for dressing until 30 minutes later.  I asked for ranch but he gave me cucumber ranch.  Whatever.. . Another friend had ordered the steak (cooked medium) and eggs special, the steak came out well done and very tough.. . In conclusion, bad service and bad food.  This place should just close down.
