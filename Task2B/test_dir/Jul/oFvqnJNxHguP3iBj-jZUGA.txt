Probably my favorite Vegas attraction. Nothing better on a cool Fall night than watching the people and the fountains.
Absolutely fantastic. It's a must see when you visit Vegas. Some don't do the tourist stuff.. But everytine I visit I want to go here. It's so relaxing at night f there are shows all the time nice music playing. And from what I have see the cleanest concrete in Vegas . I have seen so many romantic things at this location. Take your friends and family and enjoy the Bellagio lifestyle
Beautiful show. I love how they combine the music with the water. At night it is very beautiful as the water is lit up. My favorite part is the big whoooosh!
Beautiful! As a local, going down to the strip does't happen too often.  But this is a must-see for tourists.  I bring visiting friends and family here and they all love it.  It runs all day and is free! It is also outside of one of Vegas' most beautiful casinos.  Definitely a must-see!
Seriously whoever didn't give this five stars must be an idiot. This is the coolest, most impressive fountain show you can see. As a local, I will literally drive down and watch the shows any chance I get. The song choice is dramatic. The entire feeling you get is grand and impressive and you will be artistically moved. It's a must see.
The fountain plays in the evening until midnight I believe. There are signs posted by the fountain for when the shows start and the speakers announce when the next show is.. . This is a must see if you go to Vegas. It is completely free and I recommend watching a show from the right side if possible because that is the main part of the fountain. They do many different songs and the choreography follows each song so every show is different.. . Watching a show a something quick and nice to do every every night.
That is the coolest thing I've seen in vegas so far the music is synced amazing with the music that is so cool and the vibes are awesome!!!
You can't say you've visited Vegas without seeing the Bellagio Fountains. It's such a beautiful sight to see, and the music makes it romantic and memorable. Make sure to see it both during the day and at night. Grab your partner and prepare yourself for a lovely evening. I think we watched them at least four times.
Absolutely amazing! A must see.
