Great food, small selection for me as I don't like to "fishy" sushi. I'm more interested in rolls, but I guess you can ask the chef to make what you need. Just not on the menu. . . Overall, it was great and there was hardly ever a line.
Love... love... love... this place! Definitely a place to try! Let them choose your food!
I'm giving 5 stars because the sushi was fantastic, and the dishes were creative and inspired. Love the Brazilian fusion. Tried two kinds of sashimi ceviche, both delicious. Scallops were amazing. Had some salmon and yellowtail sashimi that was fresh and perfect. And, a special take on a spicy tuna roll that was unbelievable. The service was fine. Not thrilling, but perfectly serviceable.
Call me crazy, but sushi in Bellagio Buffet are much better. Service and design were cool. Food so-so.
out of this world - Japanese Wagyu & Sao Paulo ... So so so so good. . So so so so good. Will definitely be back.. . Nobu at Caesars is terrible.
Love this place!! The atmosphere is amazing and the food is gorgeous.  The sushi mixes are pretty unusual but really good and fun to taste.  The presentation is always very detail oriented.  Definitely a fun place to go with a group.  My only complaint is that it can be very loud.
I love this place! The food here is amazing and the service is always top notch!. Great fusion of sushi and Brazilian food.
With a mix of Brazilian, Peruvian, and Japanese, we had no idea what to order. Our friendly server recommended doing a Chef's tasting, which could be anywhere from $45-$200 per person. We just did $50, and got a mix of tacos, dumplings, tempura, and sushi. Everything was superb! I had no idea that there are different locations across the country, and I will definitely seek it out next time I am in a city with a Sushisamba!
We came to Sushisamba for my birthday dinner a few days ago and I was blown away by the food! It definitely exceeded expectations.. . The menu was so overwhelming we didn't know where to even begin and while our waiter didn't really help us narrow things down, he did make some good suggestions and helped us pace out the meal so we can order as we go. He came with the manager, who was very nice and gave us birthday shots, and also asked that we let him know if he could do anything. . . Here's what we started with: shishito peppers combo (grilled shishito peppers, tempura string beans with a truffle aioli, and edamame), rock shrimp tempura in a spicy mayo sauce, beef gyoza, and crispy scallop lettuce wraps. The peppers were a good surprise of the night because I didn't expect it to come with the string beans and edamame, but I definitely appreciated the greens in Vegas! The rock shrimp tempura was really tasty, but I wish it was a little crunchier when it came out. They tasted a bit soggy as if they were sitting in sauce for too long, but no complaints because the flavor was still there. The beef gyoza was good, but nothing really mind-blowing in my opinion. The crispy scallop lettuce wrap was phenomenal. Our waiter said it was a new item on the menu and suggested we try it and it really blew us all out of the water. . . We followed up the first round with the robata - we got the pork belly, rib eye, sea bass, and duck. All of them were so good, so make sure you pay a visit to the robata section when you visit! The duck and the rib eye to me stood out more than the others - they were cooked very well and had a good mix of unique flavors.. . We finished off dessert with their 4th of July special (red velvet cheesecake, frozen blueberries, and white chocolate ice cream) and sadly we were underwhelmed with what came out. I think we were so blown away by the entire meal, we felt like dessert was going to continue the streak, but were left wanting a bit more. Either way, we were so stuffed it didn't matter and the dessert didn't take away from how much we liked the meal itself.. . What really set this over the edge is that the chef came out to shake our hands and chat with us really quickly, which I really appreciated! The service was great, the recommendations were on par, and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend this spot for a special occasion - go ahead and gorge!!
Sushisamba was REALLY good! Ask for Ryan, he took car of us. We were told by the hostess Vanessa to let him know how much we wanted to spend per head for food. we said $50.00 since there was two of us. He brought us out a rainbow of food magic! There was a party in our mouths. Flavor Flave! Our bill was a lil over a 100.00 without drinks. We will definitely return! VEGAS BABY! VEEEEGAS!!!. . ASIAN BRAZILIAN FUSION!. Cheers!
Amazing! Great food, great atmosphere, great service & staff, great selection! . . We made a reservation on Tuesday night, got there 15 min early and was seated right away with no issues. My biggest compliment is to our server Vanessa...she was extremely knowledgeable about the menu! I couldn't decide between a few things on the menu as separate dishes and she suggested to put two of them together into one dish and promised it would be incredible. AND IT WAS! I ordered the filet mignon and she paired that into the mushroom tobanyaki and the poached egg was over the filet, it was a dynamite dish!
You must eat here if you're in town. A-mazing food and service. You will not be disappointed.
I've had way better sushi, nothing impressive.  This is nothing compare to Ozumo's in SF. . . The wait staff is very impatient, they kept cleaning the table before we even got our bill.  I can understand if I told them I wanted dessert, and this is why they are cleaning my table. . . I don't think the ambience is worth the price at all. . . If you really enjoy sushi please do not waste your money and come here.
This is a review of their happy hour (4-7pm and 11pm until close).. . The Skinny: spent $50+ on sub par Peruvian influenced Japanese food (2.5), service: was slow when we wanted to leave (3) value: seeing as there was only 1 dish out of 8 that we would get again, we won't likely be back (3).. . We were excited to see that they had a happy hour menu while meandering through the Venetian properties. We thought great! If the food is good during happy hour, we'll come back another time and try their other regularly priced dishes. . . So we ordered 8 out of 10 ($6)items on their happy hour menu. Of the 8, we'd probably get only 1 item again. The rest was pretty mediocre considering how much they charge for each dish and the level of cuisine.. . We should have known. I mean when the first dish - Yellowtail tiradito - came out, I knew it wasn't going to be good. The thinly sliced 2 pieces of yellowtail were drowning in a pepper sauce. I really couldn't taste the flavor of the fish at all. Definitely not well balanced. . . Wagyu gyoza (3 pieces) with kabocha puree was okay. Although the beef had a wonderful smokiness to it, the gyoza were disappointingly undersalted even after dunking in a good amount of soy sauce. The kabocha squash was relatively flavorless which surprised me after reading reviews about this dish.. . Chicken anticuchos (2 skewers)were not bad although they weren't particularly memorable either. The meat, slightly grilled/charred, was not crispy enough texturally although it was adequately seasoned.. . Eggplant anticuchos with a side of Peruvian corn was okay. I dug the slightly herbaceous kick of the chiffonated mint or basil, cutting the sweetness of the soy based sauce. However the eggplant was a tinge on the tougher side and needed to be roasted with more oil to give it a better texture.  The Peruvian corn is definitely not one of my favorite foods. Potato-like in taste and texture, the chef was able to infuse some acidity to make it more flavorful. It was more palatable with the hit of citrus but still, nothing I needed to try again.. . The sushi (Veggie kun - kind of like futomaki, Ezo roll - meager amounts of salmon/asparagus with a ton of panko breadcrumbs mixed in = bad mouth feel, and spicy tuna - acceptable but nothing exciting) was the most lackluster portion of our meal. Considering rice composes about 50% of sushi, it was highly disappointing to find it overly mushy and over seasoned. It kind of ruined it for me. Factor in the high rice to filling ratio, I cannot recommend any sushi dish made here. This is rather unfortunate because sushi comprises at least a significant portion of the menu.. . The only highlight of the meal was the salt and pepper squid. Melt-in-your-mouth tender pieces of squid with a delicate batter, this was the one dish that the hubs and I truly enjoyed.. . Food service was surprisingly and perhaps questionably prompt. There was a small gap in service with our last dish but it wasn't too bad. It was unfortunate that the bar service was slower than expected and easily overwhelmed. After our meal, we just wanted to get the check processed and go. However, a loud obnoxious group of women (aka the skanky looking anti-MILFs who obviously collected club wristbands) completely commandeered her attention with to go orders. The two other bartenders were milling around but did not help her. So the hubs had to endure some random, potentially contagious woman's behind rubbing against his left leg while she took orders from other groups of people. He was highly grumpy after being mauled and ignored.. . In reality, this joint rates about a 2.5 however I rounded up to a three based on the fact that there was 1 dish which was truly outstanding. However, given our experience, we are not likely to return. 3 starred review.
This restaurant gets very high marks.. . Let's talk about the food- everything on the menu is delicious. The different ethnic combinations is what sets this place apart. The flavor the variety, and a must Chilean sea bass skewers.. . The service- always smiling very friendly. The management comes over to give our party a complimentary app for being returned guests. They really know how to make you feel welcome and special. Everyone from the manager, bar tenders, greeters, servers, and bussing staff conduct themselves in a highly professional manner.. . If you are in vegas you have to stop here, try and do small plates and try all different things on this wonderful menu.. . This is the kind of restaurant where you would say to yourself aft spending a few hundred on a nice meal it was worth it.
Overpriced sushi. I wouldn't be fooled by the numerous reviews. Food was okay. If you order an appetizer, make sure to order the fried tiger shrimp! It was great. Avoid the overpriced side orders such as the Quinoa side order. It was recommended as an alternative/similar item to fried rice. Far from it! Staff was great on the other hand.
When staying at the Palazzo, this delicious restaurant is only a hop and a skip away.. . Located in the restaurant row connected to the Palazzo, this place is a delicious fusion of Japanese, Brazilian, Perivian and all things heavenly.  It's hard to believe I have not yet written a review, although technical I am an"regular" here!  This is my most frequently visited restaurant  when staying at the palazzo.  There are so many reasons why we Iove coming here, and here are just a few of the reasons why:. . I. FOOD. A. hamachi Kama!  Love this dish, it's my go-to dish for dinner.  Nicely grilled dish collar bone (Asians have a belief that the more movement in the muscle, the tastier the meat.  Fish collar bones are delicious because they are constantly blowing bubbles ;). . B. Robata (Japanese style charcoal BBQ)--anything cooked on that is good, from the mushrooms to the squid and the steaks...you can't go wrong! . . C. The drinks! Everything from the caipirinhas (classic & Acai) to the Prosecco flavored with elderflower liqueur and lychee puree--the bartenders here set a high standard unmatched by many. If you have a choice get your drink made by Yaz.  His drinks are golden--I will happily drink anything he makes.. . SERVICE. The manager (Jeremy) recognizes us whenever we are there and we love that!  . . One waitress in particular, Tanice, makes us feel extra special because after meeting our family once she remembers us!  Even if she is not waiting on our table she comes by to say hello.  How superb is that? The service is one of the many reasons why we tell everyone about this restaurant and also keep on coming back!. . We shall be back! :)
An incredibly classy restaurant. Went here to celebrate a birthday, and it was a top class experience. . . Go for the $50 suggested menu and add a drink. Then get ready for a delicious evening. Great ambiance, incredible service, and delicious food. My favorite restaurant of the year.. . Carmine is an incredible waiter as well!
BEST SUSHI!! Wait staff was very nice, fast and down to earth. The seating was comfortable and looked great. The two drinks I had were delicious and flavorful. Sushi was delicious and there was a large amount of options to choose from. My boyfriend doesn't like seafood but there were non-seafood meat plates that he ate and loved. We're definitely coming back next time were in Vegas!
I came for a bachelorette party last week on Friday night around 11pm. My review is probably (ok definitely) biased because I was in such a bad mood at having to wait until 11pm to eat dinner. However, as you might imagine, 5 girls using one bathroom getting ready to go out in Vegas is a production equal to Cirque de Solei that takes upward of 3 hours. But whatever we finally made it after a 15 minute, mile long cab ride down the strip from the Cosmo to the Palazzo hotel.  The restaurant was super dark (why don't they turn some lights on?) with huge TVs which were super loud. Per the usual at many "sceney" type restaurants you could barely here the people across the table from you. . . We got seated no problem as the restaurant was dead except for two or three big groups getting wasted in booths and a few lonely looking stragglers at the bar. Our server was friendly but seemed to constantly be in a rush, although to go where I do not know. There seemed to be a ton of bus boys but very few wait staff. He could probably sense our frustration so he promptly brought out a wrought iron tree full of pink drinks. Whether or not they had liquor was the only question (Answer: not enough.) So we got a range of drinks, the best of which was a cucumber lime martini with vodka. After the night's beginning, I opted with straight vodka and diet coke.. . For food we got a lot. Some  memorable dishes were the Neo Tokyo roll with tuna which was solid, heirloom tomato salad with sweet cilantro dressing, rock shrimp tempura, mushroom tobanyaki, and sweet coconut rice side. My fave dish of all was the heirloom tomato salad which was pricey but enough to share between 3 people. The rock shrimp was good but cliched, same as you would get anywhere else. The mushroom tobanyaki was interesting but not to my taste.  Sadly we did not get dessert. . In conclusion, I can definitely say i hope I will never be back with another bachelorette party, although I would not mind returning otherwise.
The ambiance is great and food is good. At times when try are busy they run very slow and not as organized.
My dining experience fell short of my expectations considering what we ate (or shall I say what we didn't eat) compared to what we paid. There were 21 of us for dinner and we had the chef's selection, also known as omakase. Typically, you would get the most innovative dishes ordering this style.  However, we were served typical menu items.  I think it was just a strategic way for them to serve a larger group without having to cater to individual orders. . . The Good was that most of the items we tasted were pretty good. The Bad was that we weren't given enough food to taste everything, even though we were all charged the same price.  . . Instead, we shared each plate of food between 5-7 people, which included the following: . (1) Tuna tataki: only got to try it because someone didn't eat raw fish. . (2) Wagyu beef dumplings: Not enough brought out so I never got to try it. . (3) Mini yellow tail tacos:  I liked the spicy foam which added a nice kick to the citrus-ey flavors of the dish. . (4) Crab tempura: How ridiculous is it that there were only several pieces to each order so the hubs and I had to share one bite of one piece? This wouldn't even qualify as an amuse-bouche. . (5) Sea bass and shrimp skewers: Again, not enough so most of us shared skewers. . (6) Steak and mushroom stew: Everyone got 1-2 thin slices of beef, which was tender and flavorful. . (7) Sushi rolls/sashimi: the sushi rolls were the most generous items served (about 5 cut rolls) but IMO were rather underwhelming. The sashimi, on the other hand, was delicious and fresh. We were given about 3 slices each of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon which I easily could have eaten by myself.. . I felt bad for the hubs because he was still hungry and asked what was being served next, only to be told that it was just dessert followed by a $2500 bill ($240 per couple). . . Yes, our server was pleasant and friendly. Yes, the food was quite tasty.  And, yes, they need to recalculate the amount of food for groups ordering from the chef's selection. Sure, I expected to pay a lot for this kind of meal, but what I didn't expect was to leave unsatisfied and wanting for more.
The fixed price dinners are WELL worth the price.  The service here is just as great as the food.  I've had dinner here on two separate Vegas trips and will definitely be back.
The best sushi ever!!  Make sure to order the sea bass and gyoza!! . . Our waiter was very nice.  Really liked their service and ambience.  Happy Hour is Sunday-Friday 4-7pm and 11pm-Close.  You can't go wrong with their happy hour menu selections and prices.  . . You must dine here when in Vegas.  You won't be disappointed!
Had the Samba Strip Roll with maine lobster, mango, crispy rice and peanut curry.  AWESOME!!  Had the Yamato Roll with caviar, foie gras, and gold leaf.  AWESOME!!  Also has the edamame with chili lime sauce.  AWESOME!!
Should be really 4.5 buttt I can't give it 5. The service was great, like Nobu's.. . So I had no idea this restaurant had so many locations before coming to Vegas. Anyways, last month, walking around the palazzo, I checked the menu out as I had seen every single cab here with a Sushisamba ad on top. I was very surprised to see that they had many Peruvian dishes. I guess I just imagined it was brazilian with japanese because of the name. I did not expect to see peruvian corn (i miss you so much).. . After much convincing, my bf and I decided to come check it out. We ordered a whole bunch of things. We did not make a reservation but they had enough space to accommodate us. I ordered a plum wine cup which was better than Nobu's. I was very interested in the peruvian part of the menu so bear with me with my choices.. . BROILED PERUVIAN BAY SCALLOP shiso lime butter crust 15.00. . This was really good. The scallops basically melted in your mouth and it kind of reminded me of the scargots at Bouchon. Very buttery.. . HUANCAINA FRIES 7.00. . I loved them. My boyfriend felt they did not have much flavor but he is not a big potato eater except when it comes to real french fries. Now, these are not really fries, they are boiled tiny potatoes with huancaina sauce and cheese.. . ANTICUCHO. RIBEYE aji panca and peruvian corn 13.00. . Delicious. I don't know why they don't offer the heart option but I guess people here in the US are not big on trying beef heart anyways.. . . WILD MUSHROOM RED MISO hand picked organic mushrooms, wakame, white truffle oil 9.00. . I didn't like it. My bf liked it a lot he said it tasted "fresh". . MOQUECA MISTA shrimp, squid, sea bass, mussels, clams with coconut milk, dende oil and chimichurri rice 33.00. . This was the first brazilian dish I've ever eaten and it was just ok. I didn't feel it was great. I think it was undersalted because it was very flavorless.
This review is for the happy hour which my husband and I visited twice on a two night stay in Vegas. You can already tell since we went out of our way to go to the same place twice when they are SO many options for restaurants on the Strip that we were fans. The Lemon Samurais alone are worth visiting for, especially at their happy hour price! We also tried several sushi rolls on the happy hour menu that were delicious...I could take a bath in that miso dipping sauce. The staff was also very friendly and attentive which made it a fun experience on top of the tasty food and drinks. Give this place is a visit if you're in the area! It's worth it.
I'm from Austin and was in charge of a dinner to cater for 14 girls... Let's say sushi samba far exceeded our expectations! The manager, Jason, truly could have been more accommodating! The wait staff was ON POINT with delivering drinks and clearing our table as well. We did the $50 per person tasting menu and got exactly what we paid for! I will recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone who is traveling to Vegas who is looking for fabulous food, fun atmosphere and a well trained staff! Thanks guys!!!
Literally my favorite restaurant EVER, let alone Vegas!!!. Its absolutely perfect--Japanese Peruvian fusion with the freshest fish, most delicious creative rolls, beautiful decor, & outstanding service!!!!. I definitely recomend the Neo Tokyo rolls, Carnival roll, SEA BASS with peruvian corn (amazing), Kanpachi, & everything else...SO GOOD!!!!!!!
Absolutely love this place.  The food is just amazing. We had a group of 4.  We asked the server to just bring out plates and set an approximate price limit ($50 ea).  There was an assortment of meat, rice and of course.. Sushi.  A couple of my favorite dishes:  JAPANESE A5 WAGYU BEEF GYOZA, Yellow Tail with Jalapeno and the plantain.  To make this place seal the deal of a 5.. The cucumber martini was delish!!!  Can't wait til the next visit.. . P.S.  Staff is fast, courtesy and overall awesome!
Sushi samba is the bomb ask for Vanessa she was great, she recommended excellent dishes!
