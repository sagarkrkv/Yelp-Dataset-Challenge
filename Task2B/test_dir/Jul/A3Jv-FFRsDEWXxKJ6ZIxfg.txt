Upscale British pub food! Great drinks! Bartenders are always fun!
For a casino restaurant, the place is pretty good. Definitely A-OK. In fact it was surprisingly good because I actually expected it to suck. I ordered the trio sampler of pies that included a chicken pot pie, steak and pie, and shepherd's pie. They were well-cooked, ingredients were of good quality, and was wonderfully seasoned. I don't know why most restaurants underseasoned their food, but it was the perfect amount of salt here. . . Unfortunately the prices were INSANELY high and I felt so bad for the wait staff. Their uniform is a cheezy body tube houndstooth patterned dress with some pleather bustier thing. Weird.
Wow! I'm so glad I came here, everything I tried was wonderful. The filet mignon was melt in your mouth heaven, my ceasar salad was dressed perfectly and was more on the vinegary side which I liked. The sticky toffee pudding and apple crumble aren't to be missed no matter how full you are. . Gordon Ramsay is pretty amazing!
This place is lively and full of energy. Service was good. They always checked up on you. The mini pub burgers were awesome according to my son. The roasted tomato soup was good according to my daughter. My wife loved the fish and chips. The lobster mac n cheese was disappointing. It was dry and was not worth $25 for a side. The red wine short ribs were also disappointing. It did not have much flavor (kind of bland) Overall, my family loved it, but i did not.
Did not reach my expection. Since this is a grill own by Gordon Ramsay.Kidna Disappionted.Especially the scotch egg, curry chicken.They are really.just o-Kay...Probaby won't go there anymore.
Much better  than burgr in my opinion. The shepherds pie was pretty good- lots of meat and the mashed potato topping was yummy. The pretzels, which used to be free, go perfect with the beers. And the cheese sauce was delicious. The sticky toffee pudding was super good! Seriously. Delicious.
So my boyfriend and I came here for my birthday ; I have been wanted to try this place since it has opened big fan of Gordon watch him in Hell's Kitchen so I couldn't imagine so where better to celebrate mybirthday. Daisy was my server she is so sweet knows the menu very well and suggested great items I didn't even really have to look at the menu I had some fruity cocktail it was very refreshing and her server asst. helped by cleaning items off table and refilling our waters. I got the ribeye medium it was so good ! I ate all it's served with potatoes and my boyfriend had the chicken pot pie chicken was very juicy and gravy was top notch! She suggested the sticky toffee to top it all off it's the best dessert I have ever had I still dream about it served with a vanilla ice cream. I will be back !!!! Thank you daisy for making my birthday special
We were seated right away.  The hostess was friendly and our server was very attentive.  The decor was cool.  The kids and I liked the dog photos on the back of some of the chairs.  It reminded us of our own dog and we were missing her.  The food was good, but I wasn't anything to rave about.  The variety of food, to me, was like what you can order at BJ's Brewery.  Same type of food, but more expensive.  I don't think we would return to this restaurant if we were in this hotel.  There was a quick food court right next door that had a variety of good looking food and less expensive.
It was awful trying to find a decent lunch spot for the July 4th weekend at Caesar's. Bacchanal had a nearly 90 minute wait for a $53 brunch and we were denied at Mesa Grill because they had a dress code for lunch (screw you Flay). Our fallback was the more casual Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.. . Anything with Ramsay's namesake should scream quality and consistency, but most of the plates fell short of expectations. We started off with the little piggy deviled eggs, which were presented with the yolk separated for self-serving. From there, I went with the shepherd's pie, which came lukewarm. The mashed potatoes had an unpleasant texture and I didn't get much of the cheddar cheese. The ground lamb and peas had no distinguishing flavor. The steak & ale pot pie came off as salty, but at least I enjoyed the crust. . . The sides we tried included the truffle fries and the lobster mac & cheese. The fries were far too similar to the regular fries and didn't have enough truffle oil. The lobster mac & cheese was worse than the Kraft blue box. While there was a generous helping of lobster meat, the mac & cheese itself was very watery and no crispy crust. We declined the popular sticky toffee pudding for next time.. . Our waitress was great and sold us on their imported beer menu. Her entertaining small talk was probably the highlight of our meal.
Terrible service, terrible food! Terrible service, terrible food! Terrible service, terrible food! Terrible service, terrible food! Did I say Terrible service, terrible food? Yes skip this restaurant!!!
This place was great! We ordered the burger sliders and the pie sampler. If I go back I'll be getting the Sheppards pie... Out of the three samplers that one was everyone's favorite and it was soooooo good! The burgers were good and cooked perfectly. . . The mojitos were very refreshing too!
Just finished my meal here and I have to say it was pretty good. I ordered mashed potatoes and ended up getting French fries but the fries were so good I'm actually glad it happened. I ordered the beef burger and it was what you'd expect a burger to be. A little too pink for my liking in the middle so I just didn't eat the inside. Over all I would come back to this restaurant or others like it.
Dear Gordon Ramsay:. . Your restaurant. We need to talk about it. . . Firstly, the waiter acted like he found us under a rock. The draft cider I had was flat. But I suppose food is your forte, so let's move on to that.. . Don't con me. I'm from Western Pennsylvania. Frank's Red Hot with minced garlic does not yield wing sauce. Butter would have helped. Grade: D+. . Prime rib does not need to be rolled in road salt prior to cooking. I've had better leftovers from things I cooked blackout drunk at 4AM in college. Grade: D-. . Your mashed potatoes are a culinary abomination. They smelled like my high school gym locker at the end of the semester. I took one bite and wanted no more. Again, apparently sodium is your secret ingredient. Grade: F. . The cooked carrots were acceptable. Grade: C. . Please, if you need a kitchen to throw pots and pans around in and act like a fussy little lady, look no further than your own chain.
Poor service, bad menu, and worse food. It's no wonder the UK is not known for their food. A disappointing dinner experience. Never again!
High expectations, sadly disappointing. After an hour of waiting for our meal, we flagged down our waiter and inquired as to how much longer until service. He had no immediate answer and appeared to be indifferent.  When our meal was finally delivered, mine was cold and dry. A second attempt did not fair much better. My money and time would have been better spent at the food court. Gordon Ramsey has a brand, and that brand was not represented well. We got our table at 9 pm and did not finish until 1 am. It is a waist of money and time,
Was looking for something a little different and thought that we would try Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill.  The hostess was more interested in talking with her friend than paying attention to customers. Was told there was a 2 hour wait for food and thought that was weird as the place was barely half full. Said we just wanted drinks and was told go ahead and grab a table.  The floors were dirty with food debris and the tables weren't much better.  We found a table across from the bar and was told by a waitress that we can't sit here we need to shown to a table by the hostess. Tried to explain that the hostess had said we could come in and get a table was told that we had to leave and have the hostess show us to a table. We looked around the Pub to see what was on tap and decided that there wasn't anything that I couldn't get at a liquor store. Based on the rudeness of the waitress and the filth would never ever go back. . . Maybe this placed should be featured on Kitchen Nightmares?. . Michael A.
If I could eat here every day, I would. I don't care that it's expensive. Everything was delicious. The food came out in record time, and I nearly stuffed myself as the waiter talked me OUT of dessert (he told me, "you really don't HAVE to." But, no, I do...). . The deviled eggs appetizer was one of the best things I've eaten. Like, ever. The Ramsay Tonic was yummy and refreshing. I ordered the Fish and Chips because I felt like I just *had* to, and they didn't disappoint. Everything was delicious. I loved the ambiance, the over-sized chairs and high tables, and pretty much everything about this place. Just go.
This restaurant is a solid four. Let's start with its a beautiful place to have a meal.  The decor is fantastic.  the placesettings, the plates everything is really top notch. I do have to say that the service was a little slow. We got there at 5:30 on a Friday so was still early but obviously busy. But it took us over two hours to eat our meal and a lot of that time was waiting because the service was just slow. The way Gordon Ramsay behaves on TV I don't think he would've been happy with the service. However the menu is really solid. It seems they have a lot of British classics as well as some very nice upscale dishes. Here's what the table had we had the pretzel breadstick snack which was delicious it came with grainy mustard and cheese. A friend ordered the scotch egg. I can't say that I am a huge fan of the concept but it was well executed. For entrees we had the scallops the short ribs and the tomato soup. None of these disappointed. For dessert we had the bread pudding and the sticky toffee pudding. Really do yourself a favor order the sticky toffee pudding no matter how full you are and even if you don't like dessert. It is moist, crunchy, and the sauce is soooo ridiculous!!!!
well taking the rents out to dinner however there was a few things that went wrong. . . . . The beet salad -- I ended up biting down on something hard that almost chipped my tooth see picture -- it was either a hard pine nut or something however not roasted nor edible I thought I was eating something other then a salad. Also the ridicule salad part ( mix with arugula ) was very sandy or harder then normal. However the beet part and the goat cheese part along with the dressing was nice. . . . The order was beer battered fish -- cough 29.00$ I shure Gordon you don't offer that price in your England restaurants. was good . . My dad got a medium temp burger that was done on the rarer side - witch put him off . however ingredients mixed nicely. . . Mine well -- ( ale pie ) the filling was amazing however I was thinking it would be more like the shepherds pie with piped mashed potatoes like Gordon Ramsey always to have tips on his other then his hair lol. But the filling aspect was great however the mashed made it feel more like a meat chicken pot pie taste .. ( dont get me wrong it was good I am not shure the topping is wright. ) . . Spotted dc ( yes I abbreviated it ) lol . was great -- I know they stress on that. . . Overall 3 meals a little confusion with seating etc. -- Also we where set back in the part with tvs for the game -- Witch was blaring -- I am 30 not old - couldn't even hear our server . . I would be willing to give it another review at a latter date - due to fact I love hells kitchen. but will be back since I am a local know well obiv with over 80 something reviewsin las vegas.
Love this place. The food is delicious, drinks are amazing, and dessert did not disappoint. Ask to sit in Scott's section. He has been my waiter every time I have gone and I have nothing but praise for his wonderful and friendly service.
Crazy busy but the staff handled it well. Great service and cold beer. I had a really good lamb burger. Wish I had time to go back for the steak & ale pie. The triple layer trifle was really good too. Next time we are in Vegas we will go back.
The best British food I've had with tons of flavour and exciting dishes. Seriously the pate board was to die for, along with the spilt pea soup.
Well, I have a candidate for Kitchen Nightmares next show. Here. Yes, here.  Went for Sunday dinner on Fathers Day.  We were seated right away.  However, that is where it all went wrong. Waiting over an hour for salads is unacceptable. Getting bloody chicken wings a half hour after the salads is not cool.  Waiting another 45 minutes for the main courses is not ideal either. So, after a 3 hour meal that was horrendously expensive for pub food, we thankfully got out of there. Servers were either rude or unavailable, which is understandable as they probably were embarrassed by the food times.  Too many other places to go in Vegas to give this another try.
Get the lamb burger!  It's so juicy and flavorful and yummmm.  I wish every burger place in the world has something like it.  The fries were decent and the gourmet ketchup served along with it was pretty tasty.  They also had $1 mimosa refills when I came here.  Great service.  I would definitely come again.
3.5 stars for the food. 4 for ambience/decor. 2 for the service!. . Long story short, you can count on less than one finger on the number of times our server came to our table after taking our order--ZERO!  Not sure if a rude server coming frequently with a bad attitude would've been better lol.. . But that's ok, didn't want to let him ruin our first meal deal after landing.  Since GR steakhouse and burgers were either sold out from Opentable or too late of a time, this was the next best thing, and I had to get my celebrity chef itch out of the way.. . The good:. . prime rib: super tender, big chunk, maybe even 16-18 ounces, and not too fatty either.  Yorkshire i've had better. . mashed potatoes: ordered another full serving.. . the average:. . server said the fish and chips were popular, I've had better.. . Staying with the server, the bus boy gave us better service, thus he deserved the 15% tip instead, which we gladly gave cash when we left lol.  Our server barely deserved his 5%!. . P.S.  took him 10min to get our bill, while he was setting up 2 tables around us....
I happened to walk by and see they had my favorite beer on tap (Innis and Gunn), so I sat down for a late lunch. I wasn't expecting much, as previous reviews have been mixed, but the Scotch Egg was phenomenal! It was so good that I stopped back in that night to have another pint of Innis and a scotch egg before my red eye flight out. Service was great, sliders were great, beer list is great. A great casual restaurant, through and through.
I've been a fan of Ramsay's UK restaurants for years, but many of his other ventures appear to be in name only. His BRGR at Planet Hollywood is overpriced burgers. This "authentic pub" (hardly) had good food, but not great, and certainly without the flair and twist of Mr. Ramsay's usual cuisine. The charcuterie was good and the burgers tasty, but nothing special. If you're going to eat here, try the scallops. That dish was truly sublime. Atmosphere-wise, the place is open to the highly trafficked casino near the entrance to the Forum Shops, so there's no feeling of being anywhere special either. Service was unattentive and spotty.
Probably the best British pub food around (and I've been to the UK before) but service is horrific and it's stupidly expensive. Had sliders, French onion soup, chicken pot pie, and fish and chips. Service was slow, entrees came out right after apps, ordered a beer during dinner which came out with the check, etc.
Lovey food here and not as busy as Gordon Ramsay's burger joint. The fish and chips are fantastic and I highly recommend them. The steak ale mini pie was better then the larger version. Salmon was good, but not my favorite.
Had a dinner date here & it was one of the highlights of our trip to Vegas last week--it helps that we already love both pub food and British fare in general.. . Briefly: The shepherd's pie was excellent, and my wife devoured her lamb burger with much love. We think the real highlights were the starters and desserts, though; the "Pub Spots" (sliders) were phenomenal, and we think well worth the price. We ordered 3 desserts to share (though it turned out to be too much by that point in the meal, and we left a little at the table) and while all were bliss-worthy treats, the sticky toffee pudding was the standout favorite (and the only one entirely finished).. . A bit pricey, but more affordable for us than, say, Gordon Ramsay Steak and (we think) worth it. The service we received (it was relatively early; we arrived around 5:30PM for dinner) was excellent, and we never felt we were waiting long for anything--and there was always someone to hand to take a plate or refill a drink or whatever was needed. . . After watching Ramsay on TV for a few years, it was nice to be able to see that he really does run (or at least put his name on) well-run restaurants with great food and service. We probably won't return, but it'll be because we've saved up for Steak, next time we want to do Ramsay in Vegas!
Eh, I would expect more from GR's restaurant considering how much he rants and raves about quality on his shows. We had the Bangers n Mash and Fish n Chips. Both were medium quality to be equated to any "English Pub" that reuses their oil for frying. . After dinner we ordered coffee (to which no menu was offered) and dessert. The coffee came out 7min before the dessert and was luke warm at best. We had to cancel the dessert due to the bitter taste the coffee left on our pallets. . Again, I expected much more from GR's establishment.
A friend and I looked forward to checking out and eating at GR Pub & Grill, so we hightailed it there. The decor def fit with the theme of the restaurant. Comfy seating, and kind waitstaff. Now here is where it gets tricky...I asked what their signature dish was and our waitress swore by the fish & chips. My friend ordered that, with the mini pot pies. I ordered chicken Marsala (Brits are known for their Indian food right?), and some lemon shrimp cocktail.  Sorry, the Jasmine rice had hair in it, was obviously old, dried out...the chicken was ok. The only thing lemony about the shrimp was the cut up lemons on the side, nothing special, rather blah. The fish and chips weren't anything to rave about either. His mini pies were supposed to be lamb, chicken, and beef. No chicken came, but he stated it was pretty good. Will I go back? No. Would I recommend a friend? No. . After paying for the meal, the waitress kind of left us hanging, as we had to ask another person to get us more drinks. I don't think Gordon Ramsey would be too pleased, not judging by his television shows. Maybe he better come to Vegas and manage his own businesses!
I was so excited to try a celebrity restaurant. This was probably not the best choice.  It was good, but it wasn't the great I was expecting. I am the biggest Gordon Ramsay fan do that was a bummer. I got the Mac n cheese with duck fat croutons and the sliders. For the price,  I wouldn't go bad.  Again, bummer!
Awful. I was shocked. Long wait and sub par food at the very best. I wish I had taken a picture of our food... Chicken Caesar salad was the most pitiful thing I've ever seen... smh
We were so extremely skeptical after last years disappointment at Gordon Ramsey's burger bar but everyone kept insisting that his restaurants are great. So.. For our last night in Vegas we decided to try here.. . After a 15 minute wait we were seated and ordered from our lovely server Jennifer. We ordered the mini burgers (6/10) and lollipop chicken for starters. They both came out super quick (within a few minutes) and while the burgers were ok the bone on my chicken was a bit cold which was strange.. I should have taken that as a hint as I bit into my chicken and realised it had a bloody raw taste and when i spat it out.. I looked down to discover that it was indeed raw.. My poor partner had eaten 3 pieces and thought they tasted weird but did not want to spit them out and after looking over at my raw chicken leg, he really wished he had... . Another server brought our mains over in record time also and we showed him the raw chicken for which he was immediately apologetic and said he would speak to the chef and manager.. . Our mains we had the New York Strip Steak (7/10) and the Lamb stew shepherds pie. (7/10) Both were good but it was quite difficult to truly enjoy our meals after being so worried eating raw chicken.. I could not wash that taste out of mouth no matter how many gulps of red wine I had! . . The server returned to inform us that the chicken would be removed from our bill (I think this is the least they could do because most likely.. We will both be sick on our 14 hour flight back to australia) and apologised once again.. . Dessert was the sticky toffee pudding (8/10) and the salted caramel sundae (8/10). Both were delicious.. . Unfortunately it was pretty difficult to recover from serving us raw chicken lollipops. The both of us including 2 pints of cider and a 250ml Pinot noir was $140 plus tips. . . So will we be coming back? No.. That's a 2/2 fail rate for Gordon Ramsay's restaurant... Such a shame.
Very disappointing! Went with the fam for dinner. We ordered the crispy calamari and chicken wing pops for starters. The calamari was far from crispy but rather soggy the batter didn't even stick it mushed up. The chicken wings were bland and cold, i had one that was undercooked.. For main course we tried the shepherds pie, sliders and fish and chips.. It didn't get better, the pie was drenched in oil and the sliders were dry.. Fish and chips were good great fries.. The services wasn't the best either, took our server 15 mins to take our order and we had to hunt her down for 20 mins to get our bill.. . Expected way better from a chef like Ramsey.
We enjoyed this restaurant very much and actually ate there twice during our recent visit to Las Vegas. We found the staff to be fantastic and the service was great.  The scallops were fantastic and the fish and chips were good (but nothing to write home about and it was recommended by waiter).  . . I would recommend this place and the atmosphere is fun, like a neighborhood pub.   We're Gordon Ramsey fans and we're not disappointed.
The food was just OK. I had a pulled pork sandwich (it is a cold sandwich), and the bacon on it was cold and just tasted like grisly left overs.  It was bereft of seasoning, too. . Our food came out fast however it was challenging getting the staff to provide a refill (it wasn't busy at the time).. With all the choices here in Las Vegas, I would not recommend!
So here is the real deal review of Mr Ramseys place. First let me tell you in was excited to eat here as I am a fan of Chef Ramseys attention to detail and search for excellence.  So I was expecting great things. . . The calamari was light and tasty nice seasoning and sauces were good. We were off to a good start. For a main course I had the new York strip. I ordered it medium and it came medium well. Still it was very good and the sauce was nice. The potatoes that came with it were cold and not seasoned. The other veggies on the plate cold. I tried the chicken pot pie and it was not bad not great. . . Dessert was a sundae. Waiter didn't recommend anything. It was average sundae nothing special. I think the place is not bad not great better than an average pub but not what I would have expected from someone so demanding of excellence.
Bring back Pretzels with that amazing cheese dip!!!!! that's all i have to say
Gordon Ramsay's Pub is a nice restaurant for a lunch or a quick meal. We ordered the shrimp cocktail (chopped up shrimp that was marinated in lemon mixed with cocktail sauce), warm salty pretzels with queso dip and horseradish dip and the BLT with Pulled Pork. The pulled pork is the consistency of chicken salad not pulled BBQ pork. Overall, the good was good but the process were a little more than they should have been.
Great service and yummy food. I have never known a bar to mess up on a Black and Tan beer TWICE so that was a little disappointing. Good wine selection and are great at pairing with your meal. The rosemary buns make the burgers and sandwiches and the Sticky Toffee Pudding is top notch! One of the few places on the strip that didn't make me feel like shit after eating here. I'll definitely be adding this to the list of places I have to go every time I'm in Vegas.
Not sure what the gripping is about. We went there on a recent trip to Vegas and LOVED IT!. We started with the pretzels and cheese and they were really good!. I ordered the Chicken Pot pie and OH MY GOODNESS! Flakey and not overcooked. The gravy was perfect. The veggies and chicken were moist and perfectly made. The wine selection offered was perfect. . My hubby had the burger and really enjoyed it with homemade chips. I would go back in a minute! . Did not disappoint.
Eating at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant was on my bucket list... my overall impression was only meh!  Don't get me wrong... The food, service,  and decor were all excellent.  But... considering this particular restaurant was just standard pub fare it just wasn't worth the prices. If you're going to pay this much for the Gordon Ramsey experience you're better off going to one of his nicer steak houses.. . That being said..  The food was really good!  We got the deviled eggs and the warm pretzel snacks. Then the mini pie starter. I had the fish and chips. And our table shared the sticky toffee pudding for dessert.  Everything we tried was delicious just expensive.  For a table of 3... With 3 beers, 2 snacks,  1 appetizer,  3 entrees and one dessert. .. total bill was $178. Could have been worse I guess
Had a late night reservation, was seated immediately.  Unfortunately they sat us next to the service station and at one point one of the bus people tried to carry too much away and dropped glasses by us.  Would have been ok had the woman not stand there and start stomping her feet like a 5 year old.. . Drinks were delicious.  I had the fish & chips, they were good.  Friend had the pie sampler (realllllly small samples) and had a very wet Caesar Salad.  Drinks were wonderful though.
Anyone break their tooth eating the beet salad? . I was there before the Shania Twain concert and ordered the beet salad that took well over 30 minutes to receive and we sat at the bar for faster service. On my second bite, I bit down on something very hard and realized something went very wrong in my mouth. The waiter, Adam, just happened to be looking at me and asking how was our food. I'm shaking by head NO and pulling the salad out of my mouth to see what was in it and found a very hard object like a rock. Then, I realized it had also broken my molar and ran to the bathroom to see the damage. It was so dark, I couldn't tell but touched the area with my finger and the nerve was exposed and sent me a zap through my body with pain. They called the EMT to write up the incident report, but by now the concert was starting in 5 minutes. We ran to the concert with my mouth in pain and came back to the Pub & Grill after the concert to meet with the EMT again to fill out the paperwork. Even the manager said, it was chewing on a rock and we also found many more smaller pieces in the salad. I had to wait until the next morning to get emergency dental care and found out I would need a crown after the temporary fix in Vegas. I ended up in bed all day with a headache, ruined vacation, missed event, and alot of pain, novocaine, and drilling...no fun!  . Long story short, I was supposed to hear from Caesar's within 3 days...never happened! I called them to find out it had been passed on to CCMSI, a law firm who takes care of their injury claims. I was told they mailed me a letter...never got it. I was told they emailed me...never got it until I called again. They never ever asked me for any information or details of the incidence except the simple form of what happened that night and my 2 dental bills. The manager had indicated to keep track of my auto expenses to and from dentist...they had no idea and never asked how much this affected my life. After not hearing from them again for weeks, I kept calling. Finally, two weeks ago the assistant got back on the phone and informed me the supervisor decided they were not honoring the claim because they didn't consider the nut shell or whatever it was to be a "foreign object." I was shocked!!! . All I could think of was if Gordon Ramsay was filming a Hell's Kitchen episode and during the tasting time of judging personally ate the "foreign object", broke his tooth off, and swallowed a piece of his molar, would that be acceptable? I've also reached out to his company in London to NO AVAIL with an email to his press department and a message to his facebook page. They have no other email for coorespondence, except to call a London phone number.  . After I called Caesar's again to let them know CCMSI had denied the claim, they offered to just pay my two dental bills for my broken tooth. Really? How about the  lost 4 days of my life, lost work, lost vacation, novocaine-drilling-crown for the rest of my life, auto expenses, not to mention all the pain and time it's taken to deal with CCMSI who has not represented Caesar's well at all. Here's the icing on the cake...there's another review in July, 5 weeks after my incident, with the same report of a shell or foreign object in the beet salad at Pub & Grill and he thought it cracked his tooth, but didn't. He even posted a pic with his review of the "foreign object". You would have thought the rock-like nutshell or whatever it is, would have been taken care of when it happened to me in such a big way. Obviously it hasn't. Now I'm talking with an attorney to get this resolved and I'm not a sue-happy person. Please message me if you've had a similar experience. . Gordon, as a business owner also, if you don't know about this, you should! Your name, personal reputation, Hell's Kitchen, and Food Network's reputation is on the line!! This was my experience from Hell and I wasn't even in the Kitchen!!!
Had the beef and vegetable pot pie and spotted dic for dessert. It was so amazing. I would eat here every day If I could!!!
So my husband and I were on a date here the night before he deployed to Afghanistan. We were really excited as we've been fans of Gordon Ramsey for quite some time. There was a 30 minute wait (no problem) and actually built the anticipation. Somewhere with this kind of wait MUST be awesome. We were texted when our seat was available. The decor was nice and the uniforms were fun. . . We ordered the Roasted Tomato soup and Truffle fries. The Tomato Soup was great, not quite as good as we just had in London, but thats okay. Truffle fries were great. We also ordered a mixed beverage with Bourbon and a glass of wine. Mixed drink was really tasty. . . Because the appetizers were so good, we were even more excited for our entrees. We ordered The NY Strip and the Scottish Salmon. What a disappointment. The NY Strip was medium-medium well when we ordered medium rare. It was INCREDIBLY chewy. We've had better steaks at chain steakhouses (no exaggeration). And the sides: the asparagus was so overcooked it was actually mushy and there were just a few tiny potatoes. The salmon came with lentils and was SO SO SO bland. LikeSO bland. Our water was never refilled and when my husband got his steak, the did not bring a steak knife and had to get up himself to go find one after waiting quite a while for someone to bring one. . . Overall, I was so disappointed and feel like I wasted my last night with my husband at a subpar establishment. We would have gotten better food from a Macaroni Grill. . . With a name like Gordon Ramsay plastered on the front of the menu, you expect to leave with a smile on your face.. . OH! And we were sitting in front of a tv that was playing a show where surgery was taking place. Nothing better than chewing on bland salmon and looking at a human organ in a plastic bag on a 60 inch tv. Excellent.
WE enjoyed our lunch. WE had a Beet salad and chicken salad sandwich. Food was fresh and the salad was great. Wish there would have been a but more goat cheese on the salad. IT was so creamy and good. Prices were a but steep for what you get, but my guess it is all because of Gordon's name. I love him so I will be back. :)
I am a big fan of Gordon Ramsey's.   I wasn't aware he had a number of restaruants in Vegas.  My boyfriend and I had lunch there.  He had the split pea soup which he loves that particular soup and he said it was  fantastic.  his only criticism was he would have preferred to have it with more peas.  It was a smooth creamy soup.  That's just him, he likes it more chunky.    I had the clams and mussel  in their shells.   As main courses he had the Double Double  burger.   The burger was cooked perfectly and was juicy and delicious.   I had the Shepard's Pie. It was flavorful and scrumptious.  Everything was reasonably priced for Las Vegas.   I highly recommend eating here.  It's located in Cesear's Palace.
