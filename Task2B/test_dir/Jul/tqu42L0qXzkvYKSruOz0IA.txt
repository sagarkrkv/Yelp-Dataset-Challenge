The whole joint is a dive in a good way.Cheap eats cheap strong drinks and entertaining clientele. Metro Pizza inside too. Use to have 2for1 pies Thurs nights.. Restaurant and BBQ special both A-OK.
Absolutely one of the best places in Vegas to eat.   It's just off the strip behind Bally's.  We had a bartender, Robo,  and was the friendliest ever!  . . The steak and eggs is $9.99 and All other breakfast items were less.  Bloody Mary's were super, and of course their beers are too.  Don't expect a lavish gourmet experience,  but don't think this is truck stop fare either.  Just get yourself in here for some excellent food at lower than average Vegas prices.
I went to Ellis Island one time a few years ago when I was out one night on the strip. I think they had karaoke and Metro Pizza. That was the reason we stopped in. I really don't remember much from that night. I do remember drinking many beers there though. Anyways, I recently stopped back at Ellis Island for breakfast the other morning because some people I know said they had good steak and eggs.. . Ellis Island is on Koval Ln just South of Flamingo Road. It is connected to a Super 8 Motel or a Hotel 8. It's something like that. I know there is an 8 in the name. You don't need to know the hotel name anyways. I am sure it is not on my list of hotels I would like to stay at. Like I said, we are talking about the corner of Flamingo and Koval. If your from Vegas you know what I mean.. . As far as the casino goes....not somewhere I would gamble, that is if I gambled. It is a very small casino and it looks like it should be located on Flamingo and Koval. I think I saw 2 pits in there. They also have some slot machines like every other building in this city. There is a bar in the middle of the casino that is a local favorite for many employees of neighboring casinos in the area. There is also a very small Metro Pizza location there. It is also a brewery, so they have a section where they brew and store their beer. It is a very old place and the decor is out dated.. . Oh yeah. Steak & eggs. The reason I stopped in there. It was $5.99 for a New York Strip, eggs, potatoes, and toast. The steak was not grass fed dry aged steak by any means, but it was okay for a $5.99 breakfast. I have had worse steaks at much nicer restaurants that costed me at least twice as much, so taking the cost of the breakfast in to consideration....I got what I paid for. I also had scrambled eggs, country potatoes, and toast. All of which were okay. Again, $5.99.. . I would recommend  stopping in for breakfast at Ellis Island once in a while if you work in the area. It is not a place I would drive out of my way to eat at though.
Good service and great food in this dump of a casino. Everyone is very friendly and I would recommend the prime rib
Looking at this place from the outside, it doesn't look like much. You have to walk thru a smoke filled casino but once you get to the cafe, it's nice. Now I came here solely based on everyone's photo of this $5.99 steak and eggs special. I was surprised to see that the menu said $9.99. I know the price hasn't shot up that much since most of the photos on here are recent. My wife and I were about to leave when our waitress informed us of the special. Later on I asked the waitress why it doesn't say $5.99 on the menu. Basically so they don't run out if everyone orders it which makes sense. So don't leave if you don't see it on the menu, just ask your server. . I have to say the steak was outstanding. I was going into this thinking it was going to be a dried out, overcooked, tough steak. Boy was I mistaken. It was a flame grilled moist NY strip steak. I order my steak medium well and it was cooked perfect. I would border to say it was steakhouse quality. It came with toast, scrambled eggs and hash Browns and that wasn't bad either. It was the deep fried hash Browns and scrambled eggs so it's not hard to mess those up. But to get all of that for $5.99 in Vegas is crazy. . I also talked with my waitress and she said they have some 4 course sirloin steak meal for $11.99 at dinner too so if you go for dinner, ask about that.
Whenever we're in Vegas, we always crave steak & eggs.  Why?  Because its satisfying for any meal of the day! Whether it be breakfast, lunch, dinner, or late night meal after clubbing... its always good.  However, it does depend on where you go.  We usually go to Ellis Island because the steak & eggs is cheap and usually good.  I prefer the steak & eggs from Tuscany but they only serve it at a cheap price super late at night-early morning...but anyways here is my review for the food.. . I ordered steak and eggs.  I asked for my meat medium rare, sunny-side up and wheat slices of bread.  Nothing to complain about it.  My steak was cooked to how I wanted it to be and there was barely any fatty pieces to it which is a definite plus.  I hate when I ordered steak somewhere and a good portion of my meat is actually just fat... so stars for that! Plus, even though the size of the meat was small, it was actually really thick so it filled me up quick!  However I do I wish they gave more potatoes with my meal because I LOVE POTATOES.  I always eat some of my boyfriends too because I finish mine so fast. lol  . . I usually can never finish everything so my boyfriend finishes whats leftover for me :)  (That's what boyfriends are for! hehe jk :)) . . Service is usually okay.. This past weekend however, we came during dinner time on a Sat night and the food took pretty long for it come out which was a bummer because I was starving! But its okay, understandable since we did have to wait for a table and all, meaning they were busier than when we usually come. . . If you're craving a cheap but good meal, come to Ellis Island for steak and eggs! (:. I'm not sure about the other items on the menu because I've only gotten the same thing everytime I've come.
Ribs were amazing, brewed Root beer was amazing. Corn, beans and garlic bread were terrible but the ribs were amazing.
I wanted to take my family, five adults, to a good eatery our first night back in Vegas w/o breaking the bank.  THIS IS THE PLACE!  Where else can you get a generous cut of rime rib, garlic mashed potatoes, veggies, and a 20 oz beer for just over $15/pp?  The meat was cooked perfectly, tender, couldn't believe it!  I got out of there for $76 less tip.  And if you prefer steak, it's even less!  This place does show it's age, but if you can set aside the frills and you're looking for a great meal at a great price, beer included, Ellis Island is a must.  And to top it all off, they provide shuttle service to get you there & back (please tip the driver).  Give this place a chance and judge for yourself.
$5.99 steak and eggs was a steal and pretty good. Service friendly but slow especially considering they weren't too busy. I would go back though. Cafe was modern looking and clean.
$5.99 steak and eggs for breakfast with potatoes and toast.  Steak and eggs were cooked as ordered.  Great meal for the money.
Great hole in the wall in Vegas! Tried dark and light beer and both are awesome! . The service is pretty slow like what everyone specified on there reviews but the servers are really friendly and nice. . . Fish and chips is a good option for people who doesn't eat meat. But the family got $8.99 for a top sirloin, soup or salad, potatoes, veggies and beer or root beer. . I can't complain. This place is a great find:)
Great food at great prices!!! I'm glad we found this place,  what a gem! The special steak dinner was delicious,  then we came here again for breakfast and had the steak and eggs for $9.99.
I had the NY steak, mashed potatoes, and salad. For $12, that's a nice, filling meal. Service was great and our waitress was friendly, but they gave us medium-rare steaks the first time as opposed to the well done we ordered; this meant an extra 15 min wait. Ellis Island is also a brewery, and they serve decent beer at a reasonable price. I don't know anywhere else that sells beer at $2.50 a pint. All in all, other than the mix-up with our steaks, this place is great.
This joint got great overall reviews here on Yelp as well as Trip Advisor. Now I concede- if you're paying $5.99 for breakfast, don't expect Gordon Ramsey fare.  I came here because after 4 days of paying obscene prices to eat a meal on the strip (e.g. $5 for A SLICE of pizza), my pocketbook needed a break. Moreover, after my class I wanted breakfast, and it was after 11 AM on a Saturday.  Now in New York you can get breakfast 24/7, no problem.  & GOOD breakfast at that.  On the Vegas strip you better get breakfast by 11 AM, and brunch fare is very limited.  I don't get this in a non-stop party city like Vegas that you can't get breakfast anytime of day any day of the week, but at least on the weekend. Smdh, but I digress...... . So my son found this joint that serves breakfast until 2 PM, & I really, really liked the prices.  It's a decent walk off the beaten path, and hence can feel a little unsafe.  But being from Brooklyn, it takes a bit more than that to scare me, but I digress.... Moreover, if you're from New York City you know: sometimes the greatest tasting food comes out of the biggest holes-in-the-wall; look at this Caridad restaurant by Woodhull Hospital in Bushwick, or Angie's Breakfast Spot also in Bushwick.  Anyway, I kept an open mind.. . You have to pass through the small, dingy, smoke-filled casino to get to the dining area.  Mind you all public spaces in New York indoor areas, and even some outdoor spaces, are smoke-free & have been so for many years, so I am unaccustomed to eating around smoke.  As the dining area was not enclosed, the faint odors of tobacco is always present everywhere, including the dining area.. . We had an expected 30 to 40 minute wait, and was seated about 45 minutes later.  My son ordered an egg white cheese omelet.  Problem #1:  egg WHITE.  I ordered safe: bacon & eggs.  Can't mess that one up. Our food came within a reasonable amount of time. What they gave my son was some round, pancake-shaped mass of (WHOLE) egg with 2 slices of what looked like Kraft cheese singles on top (!) (?).  So essentially he didn't get what he ordered, but I was not surprised that they would not understand how to separate out the yolk, and would not be the least bit surprised if they never ever had a customer request egg whites (only). & what the hell, a cheese omelet with the cheese on the OUTSIDE??  I cannot make this stuff up... Good thing he also ordered French toast, although I don't think that was anything to write home about either. . . Now my food was just that: scrambled eggs, uninspired but tasty enough albeit slightly greasy bacon, these weird potato things that taste ok/pretty good (probably microwaved from frozen), and toast that was heavily buttered and textured like styrofoam.  . . I get it: my breakfast was $5.99, and the whole bill with drinks and extra sides was $23 in total (I almost always tip 20%).  It wasn't like Wolf Gang Puck was back there slinging hash, but like I said before: in New York you can get some absolutely delicious food that is super cheap, so cheap you can feed your whole small family, and it's like you're stealing it-- you know what I'm saying" like a whole steamy, juicy, tasty rotisserie chicken from the Dominican Spot with Arroz y gandules or frijoles and/or Maduros for like $10.  And you leave the table rubbing your belly like, "Damn!" Swearing you're not going to eat for a year because you ate long after you were full because the food was That Good.  And you don't have to go to Gordon Ramsey's Steak either.  . . Anyway, my point is that the dining experience was blah at best, more like peculiar, and just nauseating at worst.  It wasn't that the food tasted bad, but was not enjoyable. & although you do get what you pay for, that certainly does not hold true necessarily with the New York dining experience (& so I am a bit spoiled!).  Much better food can be found at IHOP, and even Denny's I'd bet, for a few extra dollars.
Would have left a better review except we waited for 45 minutes to be seated, just to find out we were seated 10 minutes after they stop serving breakfast so I didn't get what I came for. It would have been nice to be told we were going to miss the breakfast menu,  we would have gone elsewhere. The food was still great,  service just ok.  At least the food was above average,  well above average.
You got to love Las Vegas. As much as you can find the high end of things, you can equally find the lower end. When I say lower end, I don't mean cheap as in quality -- I am talking about bargains. Lost a lot of money on one of those rigged slot machines? Highly unlikely. Nobody in their 70s reads my blog. You probably lost money on the Black Jack tables -- maybe in a rough game of Hold'em? Either way, just because you lost al of your money, doesn't mean you can eat like you won big. Ellis Island Casino and Brewery is a small casino just barely off the strip on Koval Lane. The casino isn't much, but the restaurant and brewery inside is another story. Filled with cheap, yet quality food and beer, it is a Vegas-er's must for those on a tight budget.. . I had the king cut prime rib. With a side of green beans and baked potato, the dish was a great balance of protein, carb, and greens. The prime rib was bloody red and fatty. This made for a juicy cut of beef and made me happy. With the fat running down the middle and the side of ajus, this was definately a juicy everything.  Topping it all off with their horseradish made everything perfect. The name "King Cut" suggests that this was a uber thick cut -- it wasn't. I mean, it's no Diamond Jim Brady Cut from Lawry's. Don't get me wrong, it was still pretty thick. At then end of it all, it was a large piece of meat that had a lot of flavor. For the ridiculous price of something like $12. Considering the price, I'd say the prime rib was pretty dang thick. Just get two and you have your thicker than thick prime rib right there, for 24 bucks! Did I mention the prime rib comes with a beer? I opted for something light -- the Hefe Weiss ale was perfect. What more can I ask for than a huge prime rib and beer?. . Ellis Island Casino and Brewery also has steak and eggs on the cheap too. For 6 bucks, you get an 8oz new york strip steak, eggs, toast, and your side of potato. The home fries were great with the eggs and toast, but the steak was the star. Of course, a lot less juicy than the prime rib, this was a true steak nonetheless. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, the lean cut of beef was at its purest. Did I dare ask for some A-1 sauce? I don't care what you say, that stuff is liquid gold. Not like we are at a fancy shmancy place. But really, for 6 bucks you get all this? Only in Vegas.. . I guess you can lose all your money in Vegas and still come out on top. Imagine if this same establishment, minus the casino came to Los Angeles, That would be nut! The same thing at a Denny's or Sizzler would be double the price. You just can't have this anywhere else but in Las Vegas. Ellis Island Casino as a casino is pretty run down. If you don't want to play bingo here, you can always play online. I don't really play bingo. I'm not my mother-in-law, you know, but when I'm in the mood and to find the best bingo sites, I use ballsupbingo.com. All in all though, the food and the beer was excellent. Just lose everything on black, but keep $20. Restaurants on the strip is most likely not worth it anyways.
Gets the job done .had a Weiss and a light beer ... Got me buzzed and I think I've had enough ;)unpasteurized beer is good for you in moderation .
