This place is great! I had prime rib yummm plus great service. I'm a big fan now. Me and my husband went there for our anniversary and both loved it. The area isn't great but the food is worth it.
Holy Jesus it feels like I'm back in Texas when I'm eating here.  Bobby Q's has the best barbeque in Arizona, hell in the world.  I'm from Texas so I'm kinda picky when it comes to brisket, but Bobby Q's is the only place that does brisket justice in Arizona.  Check this place out!
I am visiting from Portland Oregon and this is the best BBQ I have ever been to!  I love the roasted corn along with the St. Louis ribs. :)
Jack was an excellent server. Being that we were first-timers at Bobby-Qs, he was very thorough and was very attentive. I had the filet, while the rest of the family had brisket and pulled pork. One word to describe ... DELICIOUS!  And the hot cinnamon sugar donuts when we got our bill topped off our great meal. Will be back again!  Be sure to check-in on Yelp to get a discount on your bill at check out too!
Delicious food! Best BBQ I've probably ever eaten. Great atmosphere and service! Reasonably priced considering portion size and quality! Will be back for sure!
The food was great, but wasn't good enough to make up for the service.
The service was great, the product was not. The meal started with some really good corn bread, so we had high hopes. The iced tea was so bad we sent it back twice and ended up switching to Pepsi. They forgot our appitizer until after they brought out the entre. The  q rolls were OK once they got to us. The pulled pork was so over cooked it was nearly the consistency of mashed potatoes. The brisket was ok, nothing worth the $22 price tag for the 2 meat combo. All that being said they knocked of the app and one drink.
My boyfriend and I went to Bobby Q's last night for the first time because a friend recommended them.  We chose to sit on the patio which was a great choice as we had a pretty quiet meal. The mister's and the fans kept the area nice and cool even though it was close to 110 out.. . We were promptly greeted by one of the best waitresses I've ever had the pleasure to be served by. She did her best trying to gently upsell us as is expected at restaurants these days, though she was far from being pushy. . . The food was a little expensive in my opinion which is the reason for the 4 stars, though I probably would have gone 4 and a half because it truly was some of the best barbecue you could have.  Not a long wait either! . . All in all it was a great experience, but as a warning, try and beat the dinner rush or you'll end up waiting for a long time. It's a pretty popular place.
Food is amazing, service is great! The prices are very reasonable especially for how much food you get. . . On the flip side, I wouldn't do the nightclub that it turns into after dark. They charge a cover for both males and females. The drinks are overpriced and the atmosphere is stuffy. Clientele that shows up after dark is very sketchy. Would never go there without a guy in tow. But I would definitely go for lunch or dinner! It's such a 180 its unbelievable!
Came in here for dinner while staying in North Phoenix. Seated immediately (even though it looked busy!), waiter was friendly and made great beer, wine, and food suggestions. We ended up splitting a platter with St. Louis ribs, beef brisket, and smoked sausage with Mac and cheese and a dressed baked potato on the side. Scrumptious! Finished with a surprise bag of fresh homemade cinnamon donuts. If it wasn't so far from my home in the east valley I would definitely return!
I'm baaaackkkk! And all is still great. Service and food.. The service really shined on this visit. The food just speaks for itself. Just go. You can't go wrong.
Anyone that knows anything about BBQ and large chain restaurants knows that it is extremely hard to mass produce BBQ and still make it delicious. For this very reason I was skeptical about going to Bobby Q. Then I looked at the ratings and saw that the restaurant has a greater than 4 star rating. I HAD TO GIVE IT A SHOT! . . I ordered the full rack of ribs and loaded baked potato with mac and cheese on the side. WHOA! I must say that Bobby Q thoroughly impressed me! The smokey taste and tenderness of the ribs was out of control. Not to mention, when I was done, I was full as a tick! I actually thought I was the one in the back of the restaurant Q'ing it up on the smoker. But after I woke up from my daydream, I realized that Bobby Q is or SHOULD BE a staple in the greater Phoenix area. . . When I come back to Phoenix, this is definitely one of the restaurants that I will have to indulge in a repeat visit, just to make sure I wasn't in a dream of bliss and desire. . . Bobby Q's... Phoenix is supposed to be well known for Mexican food and taco shops, well, my friends, you have made your mark, I will remember Bobby Q's for BBQ!
Ask for Chelsea the waitress! She was so great! She made us feel so welcome! The food was seriously... Unreal! Coming from the east valley, I've always gone to joes bbq which has always been "good". But bobby q is different ball game all together. Puts all other BBQ places to shame!!
The food was awesome. Our server was the best. I believe her name is Alexis. Wish we lived closer, we would be here more oven.
After reading and hearing about Bobby Q I figured I had to find out for myself. . . When it comes to BBQ I find it, like others, hard to get quality BBQ. If I do venture into something new trying to find that diamond in the rough I have 3 staples to sample: Baby Back Ribs, Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket. I also judge beans and some carb. . . I ordered the staples with beans and Mac & Cheese. I wasn't given an option for wet or dry BBQ. I had to ask as the bartender was walking away to make mine dry and put it on the side. . . The meal started with a very moist and greasy corn bread basket. The greasy texture made me use a fork just to get it anywhere close to my mouth. . . Moments later my dry BBQ arrived and the server started walking off when I had to ask for BBQ where I learned there were 3 options: regular, spicy or a third that I don't recall. Nice to know that NOW. Thanks bartender. . . The ribs looked good but pulling apart showed they were not smoked at all. Just a HIGHLY salty rub and grill time. The pull apart can be achieved by many alternative means. . . The pulled pork was sweet, quality pork, but the exact same texture as what I get out of my crockpot. There was no bark, no sign of a smoke ring, nothing to indicate this was BBQ. . . The brisket is the only reason I gave this place 2 stars. They gave me 4 slices of what I would call Prime grade and perfectly smoked. The brisket showing a solid smoke ring and bark and it barely held together which is well beyond many other joints. . . The Mac and Cheese are almost exactly like Kraft Blue Box, so not original at all. The beans however were al dente and smoky sweet. Again, nothing special. . . To top off the epic failure in service, there was no wet nap offered or within sight. Really?? I just wanted outta there and to let others know, order a steak or prime rib to go.
Best BBQ in AZ! My mom and I came here for dinner and started our meal off with the Q-rolls for an appetizer. They were good and definitely worth a try. We then ordered the Hog Heaven for our entree. The Baby back ribs are so tender that they fall off the bone! The beef ribs were good but not as tender which was expected so no complaints here. The pulled pork and chicken are also delicious. As for the sides, the mac & cheese was good and creamy  but the baked beans and coleslaw were mediocre. We stuffed our bellies and still had enough for leftovers. This place is definitely on my list of places to bring people when they visit me in PHX.
I would consider myself a pretty good judge of BBQ and Bobby Q was some of the best I've had.  The St. Louis ribs were fall off the bone tender and incredible.  Brisket, tender and flavorful.  Cornbread?  Scary addictive.  My only complaint would be that the Mac and Cheese tasted like it was out of a Kraft box.  Guess you gotta cut costs somewhere.. . I think a good judge of who knows their shit on BBQ on yelp is whether someone like Joes Real BBQ or not, apologies if you think that place is good but it just isn't worthy of the praise it gets.
While I haven't written a ton of reviews on here I reserve five stars for an establishment that is truly outstanding, and Bobby Q fits that bill.  When an appetizer alone is so delicious that I would (and have) drive the 30 minutes from my house to get them speaks volumes.  . . Q-ROLLS!  Q-rolls are ridiculously delicious by themselves but when you add the sauce that it comes with its another level.  I have sincerely come here just to get two orders of these because they are that good.  They have ribs for every type of person.  I'm a fall off the bone rib guy but people I've dined with there are not, so Ive tried various types of ribs and each one were fantastic even though the baby backs were my favorite. . . The wait staff have always been top notch and stellar with their recommendations and attention.  My ONLY complaint is that they are so far away but that isn't their fault.  I beg of you Bobby of the Q open another location!  Regardless of distance Its an amazing restaurant that I would find a way to visit even if it was on the moon.
We discovered Bobby Q because it was recently highly rated nationally in the NY Times. The ribs and brisket were tops of the night - we ordered the sample platter with two ribs, two meats and 3 sides. The St. Louis ribs and Baby Backs both were perfectly booked and bathed luxuriously in an excellent barbeque sauce - my wife with regular, me with the hot version. Very friendly service, and lots of happy people. Joe's in Gilbert and Bobby Q in Phoenix... two great reasons to live in the Valley of the BBQ Sun. Highly recommended!
A friend and I tried Bobby Q for the first time a few days ago. Reception could use some additional training in customer service. I had the two meat combo plate with brisket and baby-back ribs recommended by our server ALEXANDRA, WHO WAS AWESOME!! Meat was delicious, tender and juicy. My sides were Mac N Cheese & grilled veggies, both which were also great. My friend had the prime rib and shrimp, which were also cooked perfectly and he enjoyed them a lot. Dessert was apple cobbler, which was also well done. Overall, a good experience. Portions are ample, but so are the prices. Dinner for two with drinks and tip was $85.
Had the Pulled pork sandwich, amazing. Have been here two other times. Brought my wife and daughter. They were equally pleased. The waitress was top notch as well. I will be going back here often.
Traveling all day looking for somewhere to eat, we stopped here taking a risk as to what we would get.  It was after 9pm and we were not expecting much.  I was extremely shocked at the quality in a great way.  It was so good that i had to come back a second time while i was in Phoenix.  . The service was amazing and the food was tasty.  The first night i had the pulled pork with mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was amazing.  The second night i had the beef brisket and mac and cheese.  I cant remember the other side i had because the mac and cheese was that good.  . On the first night after eating, we were given a complimentary desert, not sure the name of it, but it was amazing.  And then the little doughnuts were the next arrival.  They are hot and ohhh so good.  A great finish to a great meal.  . I will go back again and send others to eat here.
Amazing!!!! Best BBQ in AZ I promise you. Meat cooked perfect, sides were great, big portions. I didn't try the dessert because I was so full but it looked yummy.  Staff was super nice as well. A++
