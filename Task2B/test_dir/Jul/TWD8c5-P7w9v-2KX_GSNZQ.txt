The pools were nice and the buffet was alright for a buffet but between the bad ac and the departure service, it gets only three stars.  The rooms were quite nice but the ac seemed like it wasn't accurate.  I put my room to 72 and it felt like 79.  The taxi/bag service when departing was really poorly organized and took forever.  I spent three great days here but left with a very bad taste in my mouth because the departing service was absolutely atrocious.
So it's about as far away as you can get from anywhere you'd want to go to on the strip and still be on "the strip" and honestly getting anywhere without a taxi is kind of a pain in the ass. Especially when it's hot. So if you're looking to have a central base to operate out of for drunken adventures in Vegas, go elsewhere. . . But, I'm not that person anymore. I don't mind mostly sticking to my own hotel/resort, as long as it's good and there's stuff to do, and the Mandalay Bay pays off in that regard. There's decent restaurants (really, go to the Border Grill), the pool is awesome (show up at the lazy river early and don't bother with renting a locker, they're a pain in the ass to get to and unnecessary), and the aquarium is actually kind of cool and worth a visit.. . You can sort of get to somewhere you want to go if you take the tram to Excalibur and then walk from there, but pedestrian traffic to and from this place seems to be actively discouraged.. . Also, if given the choice of a pool view or strip view take the pool view any time, since the "strip view" really just kind of overlooks the airport and some weird mystery construction project next to McDonalds.
Mandalay Bay is a great hotel on the outside strip of Las Vegas.  We stayed here for 4 nights, especially to hang out at the pools!. . When you arrive, the bell hops and valets are very quick to grab your luggage and get you to the lobby to check in!  Super!. . Our luggage arrived at our room almost 5 minutes after we arrived.  Super!. . The Pools:  FUN!  There are 4 main pools:  1) The Wave Pool, 2) The Lazy River, 3) The general pool, and 4) a smaller pool.  The water is kept very clean, despite everyone's sun tan lotion and suntan oils constantly being put in the pool.  The life guards are young, which means that they aren't fully excited about their jobs.  Most of them just appeared satisfied to be there.. . HUGE KUDOS goes out to LIFEGUARD TAMMY!  She is a very experienced lifeguard, who was constantly watching the guests like a hawk!  She made swimming in the pools very safe.  I even saw her helping a couple of handicapped, pregnant, and new mothers find seats in the very crowded pools.  She constantly cleaned up towels that the guests had laying around and left without picking up after themselves.  She was always looking to clean up after guests and to make it a very comfortable and safe place to relax.  Thank you Tammy!. . The rooms in the hotel are large, clean, and newly updated.  The beds are comfortable.. . I have two minor complaints about my stay:  First, I tried to call the front desk to ask a question and ended up calling twice.  The first time I called, it rang 15-20 times and no one picked up.  The second time I called it rang 15+ times and someone finally picked up the call. . . My other complaint is that I called the Bell Service to help with our luggage at 11:30.  Checkout time is supposed to be 11:00, but we got a late checkout at 12:00.  After three calls to the Bell Service and after tipping one of the bell boys downstairs to lure him to the room to help us with our luggage, we were finally assisted at 12:45.  We waited ONE HOUR and 15 MINUTES for a Bell boy to help us with the luggage.  I realized that it was right after the peak time of checking out, but that was pathetic!. . Facilities Grade:  B+. Service Grade:  D-. Waterpark Features & Services:  A+. Worth the Money Grade:  B. Overall Impression Grade:  B
We arrived for a conference and were told our class of room was no longer available.  The clerk quickly arranged an upgrade and we spent three days in an incredible suite.  Every detail was taken care of and our experience was amazing.  We will definitely return.
Had a great time with the family over the 4th! We had thunder n lighting.....rain last night, after the fireworks shows. It was like taking a shower, as it's been well over 109 here. Time to hit the road....back to the coast of California.
Stayed here again and it was just as amazing! I am staying at the The Hotel at Mandalay in a couple of weeks,as a birthday treat to myself, I cant wait!
I honestly enjoyed my stay here, but I'm deducting one star for a very rude employee named Wendy. Wendy clicked the phone on me when I called from my hotel floor informing her I was locked out of the room. All because I wasn't the official name under the room, the security wasn't able to help me unlock the door (fine), but instead of telling me politely, she slammed the phone on me, and yes, I was still locked out for a good 15 min until the person the room was under came back up for me.. . . Aside from Wendy darlin', I loved my spacious non-smoking room on the 19th floor with a beautiful pool view. I def had lotsa fun spying on people at the pool,and at daylight beach club on my lazy mornings, haha.
The worst service I have ever received at a hotel. Waited 1.5 hours to check in with only 3 front desk staff. Lost my sons life vest and tried getting in touch with lost and foundand they kept switching me to other people. Never could I get someone to actually help me till I waited to get a right answer from a supervisor. Got my car from the valet and noticed a crack on the windshield of my passenger side. Ordered dinner at the noodle shop to take upstairs to feed my baby and the order was completely wrong after I got up. I called the restaurant and it took me 20 min to convince them to bring it up to me. I had the worst experience ever. If u want service or help in anyway, this is NOT the hotel!!!!
Everything was great overall.... a little pricey and $25.00 bucks for a float tube for the Lazy River? My "Main" problem was I was told, back in Feburary I could get my military discount, but had to do it when we showed up on July 3rd. for our 3 day vacation and just show my DOD ID. When we got there last week and the check in agent told me I should've done this when we did our reservations. I wanted to give them the #'s I told her. She said..."I don't know what to tell you, sir! I can't change it this busy 4th of July weekend. My wife told me...just leave it along honey, it's OK! So, I did! But now, after we got back home....I still think it's not right.
The hotel itself is great but customer service is poor. We came to check in at 7pm and were told our room wasn't ready. How this is possible is beyond me. We had somewhere to be so we needed a room to freshen up. We asked about a suite upgrade since our room wasn't ready and were told it would be 50$ a night but since our room wasn't ready she could do 30$. At this point I would think it appropriate to offer any other options that were available, however they did not. We took the upgrade but were then told the suite in Mandalay Bay wasn't ready either but that we could move to THE hotel. . Once we got to the room I called to speak to a manager because it really isn't acceptable to not have a room ready so late in the day and to be charged for an upgrade when other options were available but not given. . The customer service person I got routed to had no intention of listening to what I had to say or of giving me to someone in management which is what I kept asking for. She kept giving reasons for why it was ok that we were treated this way. She even went so far as to say "well, rooms were ready, Mrs. So-and-so" Clearly not the room we booked was ready otherwise we would not be having this discussion. When I travel I pay for an experience, not just a room. . The room itself is nice, recently upgraded and very clean feeling.
5 stars because my girlfriend lost her wallet and had it back in her hand in less than 10 minutes thanks to the wonderful security at this hotel. They took what would have been a deal-breaker for the entire trip and turned it into a very positive experience.
Pools too crowded.Too long of line to check in. Its ok if they take my money at the tables but it was not right the maid stole $100 that we hid in closet. I will not stay there again.
I just spent two nights here (7/7 and 7/8) for a mini summer vacation with kids and older parents.  Check-In time was not impressive, it was a long line on Monday July 7th.  When we finally got to the counter to check-in the staff that was helping us just walk away and didn't tell us where he was going.  After 10mins of waiting, we asked the counter staff next to us if she can help us (her name is Sara) and she did wonderful, professional and friendly job, big kudos to her!  However, we didn't get our rooms for an hour and half after check-in and there were no lounge area to rest after a long drive so it was annoying.  . . On the good notes - the rooms were clean, the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was clean and nice.  The pool was good for the kids.  The staffs around the facility were friendly and helpful!  The restaurants and shops were ok.  The Citizens Restaurant has very good latte and foods were decent.  The casino areas are roomy and high ceiling so you don't smell the smoke at all.  . . You can take the tram to Luxor or Excalibur and walk about two or three minutes into the strip where all the nightlight are.  . . Overall experience, I say it is alright.  Would probably stay elsewhere in the middle of the strip next time.
I upgraded the rating on this resort from a one star to a two star because they contacted me and apologized for the poor service. They gave me a voucher for a free night. If I do go back to Vegas, maybe I'll take them up on the offer to make up for this stay. Overall, they need to improve their customer service. I hope they do!
Pools!! Room!! Nice place! Lots of Fun!! The pools are allot of fun!!  FUN FUN FUN
Who doesn't love comp-rooms?! Anywho, service here needs a bit of help but I mean, the rooms are pretty nice. The place itself is amazing, especially the beach/pool area. The lifeguards there need.. I'm not sure what they need but everyone looked so sad. There were about 10 lifeguards at the wave pool alone & none of them had smiles on. All wore frowns & looked down. WEIRD.. . The lady to helped us at the front desk was okay. She wasn't too friendly but wasn't rude. We had to go to 3 different places just to get settled but in the end, it all worked out. . . This place is also under construction so maybe next time I come, it'll be finish.
It's hard to imagine only 1 star due to this hotel being above average in cost.  . When I'm paying for a nicer hotel, I expect at least B+ service.   We left with the impression that this hotel is all about squeezing every dollar out of you and they're not worried about feedback since there are 1500 more people checking in every day. . . 1.  Lazy river.   They advertise this big time but they don't tell you they charge $24 for an inner tube.  If not free, they should at least rent them for a few bucks, right?   TIP: Go to CVS on the strip and get the same inner tube for $4.   . . 2.  They advertise the shark reef but it costs $18 for this mildly entertaining adventure.. . 3.  No coffee in the rooms.  Ok, my math says they save around $1,000,000 per year by not having coffee in 4000 rooms.  Fine.  At least have enough coffee shops in the hotel.  There's only Starbucks and one other coffee place.   I don't even mind the extra markup.  However I waited 30 - 45 minutes in the morning for a cup of coffee with a bunch of angry people.  They're also grumbling about the lazy river while waiting for coffee.  . . 4.  After driving hours to get there, we had to wait 45 minutes to valet our car.  The valet parker told me it's like that all summer long.   Translation:  They're too cheap to hire 2 more valet guys to make it quicker.   When I left and came back that night, another 30 minutes in the valet line.  Outrageous.. . 5.   Problems with our room:  Bathtub was dirty and 2 lights didn't work.  . . Any time you try to give feedback they say the same thing:  Sorry, we have 1500 people checking in today.. . On day two, I phoned guest services to tell them I'm not happy and I may check out a day early.   Their response:  "Ok sir, I have you leaving on the 27th now.   Any thing else?"   They didn't even ask what the problem was.  . . I filled out an email survey stating all of the above and asked them to contact me.  NO RESPONSE.   My wife is so easy to please and she encouraged me to check out early.    We came across dozens of guests that were having a similar experience.    Keep ignoring us but eventually it will catch up with this hotel.  . . I will never stay here again and it's a shame.   If they just cared a little, it would be a great place.   The wave pool and lazy river are fun for kids.
I recently had the pleasure  of staying at Mandalay Bay. I have stayed at many of the other hotels on the strip (MGM, Planet Hollywood, Venetian, Treasure Island and Hard Rock) and expected Mandalay Bay to be about the same...it was sooooo much better! Although the check-in line was long (about a 30 minute wait) the front desk staff was very accommodating and even gave us a "suite" upgrade when we asked! . . The suite (on the 61st floor!) was stunning! Full dining room, living room and bedroom. 1 1/2 bath (full bath had a tub with jets) and a half kitchen (small fridge only). We had views of the airport, lazy river and wave pools. It was awesome!!. . We visited the pools and lazy river and enjoyed our time. I wish we had known to bring a pool float for the lazy river- we had to buy one there for $25! Yikes! Also had the chance to check out Moorea (adults only pool on the upper level). It was relaxing (loved the pool with jets) and had a great view. . . Overall, Mandalay Bay is one of the most hospitable and friendly hotels on the strip. It is good for a variety of groups (couples, singles, families, bachelor/bachelorette parties) and has a range of activities on site! I will definitely be back!
I have arrived to an instant migraine, the current construction in the main lobby of check-in/reception is beyond obnoxious, my ears are ringing and I have been standing in line to check in for over 30 minutes! Customer service is completely neglected by the lack of employees facilitating check in..... Do not stay here already off to migraine induced, annoying start! Figure it out Mandalay Bay! Especially for the price your guests pay!  Ugh!!!!
Came here for a vacation for one night and they made me wait for over an hour to check in WHILE THERE IS POUNDING CONSTRUCTION!!# OH MY GOD... ITS SO LOUD AND ITS HURTING MY HEAD. I CAME HERE TO RELAX!! Not to mention the service is super slow and they put so few check in clerks that the line takes a long time to move!! The check in guy George is also not trained well so he keeps going back and forth just to check us in to an already prepaid room!!
Valet full for our entire stay. Buffet and cafe closed at the same time in the afternoon.. Have yet to hear back about cloths my son left in the room.. Other than this it was OK. . Stayed 3 days here and 3 at Bellagio. Bellagio way better.
Booked two suites at the Mandaly bay resort and I was switched to THe Hotel. 8 in my party and needed the big rooms. They switched it on me and was not compensated. Butt sore? Yes.
was in line for 2 hours to check in, no explanation given for the ridiculously  slow service, a nightmare.
SHAME SHAME SHAME ON YOU MANDALAY BAY.... 1-star because I can't post otherwise... if I could give u a negative, you would have it... . Originally posted on Facebook 7/8/2014. . On what was to be my 1st experience in Las Vegas, this is the poorest excuse of customer service I have ever experienced.. . Upon check in, we were made aware that special requests were only honored when available. I get that. I'mnot completely clueless to customer demand. But upon check-in, it should not have taken your agent to have to go back to 'back office' four times for a manager to come out to field a customer complaint. And when said manager, I believe her name was Kristin Kutcher, I thought it was to work some "customer service magic" and come up with a compromise, not to basically tell us "tough shi*". So begrudgingly, we took the handicap accessible room that was given to us. (Also, I would seriously reconsider your training tools when it is acceptable for a 'manager' to respond with blatant attitude from two customer service stations away about "how much she DOES LOVE HER JOB, thank you very much", when a unsatisfied customer voices his difference of opinion to HIS friend).. Come to find out the next morning that the shower that only had a curtain, no lip or door, drain was clogged which flooded our entire bathroom. When going downstairs to complain, we had a maintenance person basically plunge and snake the drain and use the towels designated to OUR ROOM to clean it up. And THEN dump all the dirty towels in the bathtub and say somebody will be back later to clean this up... and 8 hours later, with dirty towels STILL in the tub and dried up left over debris from the drain all over the floor, NADA?!?!? And on top of that one of the 2 TVs didn't even work. Room # 33125, in case you were wondering. Upon coming downstairs to inquire about the situation, I was given notice about the room change and what kind of timely manner I was expected to collect my things. So within an hour, our room was changed (to #33317) which was about the same except this shower had hair all over the shower from the previous guest.... . Wow, way to drop the ball on this one. I would like to make note that I DID try to contact you via private email groupleads@mandalaybay.com, the ONLY email address that can be found on your website) while we were STILL THERE to maybe rectify the disappointment, and unfortunately it looks like it had gotten 'lost in cyberspace'.. . I am well aware that you are a multi million dollar, if not billion dollar establishment and wanted to express to you that, although we were not 'high rollers', our money is just as green as anybody else and we should have been treated appropriately.. . . UPDATED 7/15/2014. . I didn't think I could have left with a worse 1st time impression of a hotel than i did with this company. I was wrong. I do want to acknowledge that the Facebook rep that did contact me was helpful as to direct my concerns to the appropriate channels. So, good for him/her. Outside of that... I was contacted by their social media department. I did get a letter profusely apologizing for all the issued i incurred. And if I could say I was satisfied, I would do so here. But I'm not. they did review my concerns and did in fact in an effort of "goodwill" credit my account resort fees that were charged to me. which i believe was around $100. but compared to what was initially pre-paid for the room, this is the equivalent to THE TAX. I compare this to going to a high end restaurant, having terrible service and horrible food and having the restaurant taking my iced tea off the bill. . . Although this has some features i did like very much, (citizen's restaurant was delicious. and I'm sure the Michael Jackson/Cirque du Soleil, is amazing) I would tell anybody (EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT READS THIS).... . DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.. . They have things you can walk in and see and do but STAY somewhere else.
I've stayed on the MBay property approximately 17,482 times so I can't believe I've never gotten around to posting a Yelp review. Anyhoo, the rooms themselves are starting to feel bypassed by all the bigger-and-better that's opened over the last 15 years. They're still fairly spacious and our room in July 2014 was well-kept (carpet/linens in good repair and no chips on the furniture), but those once-vaunted bathrooms feel plain now (and the showers small) next to Mandarin Oriental/Cosmopolitan/Aria/Encore/Palazzo and the like and the room decor that was put in a few years ago is feeling pretty plain.. . All that aside, this place is all about the public areas if any resort ever was. They've recently spiffed up the casino carpet with an elegant deep blue/maroon/beige design that replaces the dated-looking tropical flower design it used to have. And the chandeliers in the casino are still very cool and the layout is far less maze-like than most. It's very easy to navigate. The drinks at the tables aren't watered-down and the cocktail service is more frequent than at many other large properties. . . Of course, the mega-pool is a huge draw for many. It's always crowded and it's hard to find lounges sometimes, but the different environments are still pretty special. There's the sandy beach with the wave pool, plus a few other smaller pools spread around. Generally, you can find a spot to park even though it may be a bit of a hunt. There's also the Moorea "European" pool area ("Toptional!" say the posters advertising it throughout the property.) There's also a casino and a beach bar/grill added within the past few years.. . My favorite here is the restaurant collection. Just about every conceivable food genre has been covered and many of the restaurants have been here since day one, which says they're doing something right. Decor is important and ranges from the dark ice bar at Red Square to the cool modernism of Aureole to the trickling stream of Shanghai Lily to the awesome lattice woodwork of StripSteak. Of particular note for a casual meal is Burger Bar in the Mandalay Place shopping arcade, which should be a mandatory stop. For something higher in price and altitude, don't miss miX atop the adjoing THEHotel (soon to be Delano) tower. It has the absolute best lounge view in all of Vegas (forget GhostBar). And guys, you can drain the lizard while overlooking the pool area from the window-side urinals. And this summer at least, the lounge gave out free glasses of champagne at sunset. Just about every restaurant in the place has either an early or a late happy hour special, so you can spend from 3pm to midnight crawling from happy hour to happy hour (I've done it, so I know it's possible). . . The spa isn't as much of a wow as many of the other newer ones, but the plunge pool area does have a cool jungle decor. . . Service-wise, it's never been especially polished, but I've never had a real issue in all my visits either. To me, this is a reliable, all-around property that at least succeeds in all the Vegas elements and excels in some.
My boyfriend and I just left yesterday and we both really enjoyed the hotel!  It is undergoing construction, however it should not be penalized because of it.   Valet in the summer in vegas is full EVERYWHERE ... we self parked and it is such a short distance from the door and saved us a couple bucks in tips... . . I was able to redeem myvegas room comps for both of our nights and only had to pay the $28.00 per day resort fee .. so our AWESOME room on the 33rd floor facing the strip with a view of everything only cost us $56.00. . Bayside Buffet is also incredible ~ The quality of food is by far above other buffets in vegas ~ again with the help of myvegas it was free !!!! . . Any issues we had were quickly and politely addressed.  . We will be back ASAP !   Especially since MyVegas offers so many different fun comps it really makes mini vacations SUPER affordable!!!!  . . C you soon Mandalay !!!!!
Great resort for a family trip. The kids loved the lazy river and wave pool. Nice rooms and great service everywhere in the hotel. This is not my first time staying here and won't be the last
Hotel and it's casino and pools, Restaurants, etc were excellent.....reason I gave it 3 stars was the air conditioner in our room was terrible. Could not get the room cold, even when setting on lowest setting.  Couldn't sleep at night as room was warm. Called Guest Service twice and maintenance person never came to our room....it is what it is....probably would not stay here again....
This is my very very favorite hotel to stay at in Vegas! The wave pool and beach like setting is so pretty, plus the lazy river is so fun and relaxing! This trip was my first time staying in THE Hotel tower of the resort, an all suite tower. Room is great, two rooms, living room and bedroom with two queen beds, powder room off the front entrance and huge bathroom. Visited the hark reef years ago when I was a kid, and that was awesome too. For sure visit the buffet as well, my favorite one on the strip. AND now MB is home to the Michael Jackson show, even better!
My one star is for the one hour of sleep that I got on my last night in Las Vegas. When I checked in I was asked if I wanted a room overlooking the pool area. I was also warned that from 3 to 11 on Saturdays there is a live band by the pool. I was totally fine with it as I was not in my room during that time. I did however return to my room on Sunday night at 11 p.m. for a good nights sleep before my early flight the next morning. Hotels are ALSO for sleeping even if you are in Vegas. I laid my head down only to experience the thump thump thump of the base, the DJ and the strobe lights emanating from The Mandalay Bay Daylight Club on the other side of the pools that were below my window. WTF??? I was never told about this when I checked in to my room and I cannot believe that a hotel would have an outdoor club open until 3 or 4 a.m.  I am by no means a curmudgeon and like to party like the next person but REALLY??? I listened to this club crap for 3 hours just waiting for it to stop. Once it did, my head was pounding and my sleep left little to be desired. . . Other issues that I experienced were the long check-in line and the lack of elevators during the day. There were 8 elevators in my lobby. I waited while only two elevators worked. When they opened they were jam packed with customers and their suitcases on the way to leave. The same elevators would go up and down only to open with the same people. I ended up walking down 13 flights of stairs (with two other people) that took us through Human Resources dept. of Mandalay Bay. Not very secure if you ask. me. . . The best part of my stay was the beautiful room (even though there was no coffee maker) and Michael Jackson show. I will be checking out other hotels on my next visit to Vegas.
I've stayed at Mandalay Bay once before for a friend's bachelorette party. And the standard rooms were more than spacious to fit five girls!  The bathroom situations can be a different story but we had no problems.More recently, I stayed in one of the suites and they are very nice.  I used myvegas rewards to get one night free, but had to pay full price for the other night and the resort fee for both nights.  Honestly, I was very skeptical if this really worked.  It does, when you redeem your points, you'll receive an email with your redemption code and a number to call.  I thought at first I can just enter the code online, but it didn't work and never was given an option to enter the code.  I will tell you the call can be long, but worth getting a free room(s).  Only downside about this is, they don't send you a reservation confirmation on free nights.. . When my then-boyfriend and I arrived to Mandalay Bay the check-in line was long.  We arrived around 3:30pm check-in time for everyone.  On top of that, it was right before EDC weekend.  The line did move faster than I expected.  Prior to the trip, my boyfriend wanted to upgrade the room to a suite.  I told him I didn't want to pay extra money for it... I thought the standard room was fine and we got a free room, I didn't want to have to change rooms.  He said he would pay the difference and he really wanted a suite.  I just rolled my eyes and said if you want to.  We got to the front and we  were help by George.  He was very helpful with check-in us in, friendly while he looked up the best deal for us, and providing the upgrade my boyfriend wanted, which cost an extra $100/night.  We got to the suite and I was amazed at all the space we had and we had a strip view!  And I was glad we did get the upgrade.  Only thing that I didn't like was trying to take pictures of the strip from the room. We were where they have those advertising for the shows at their hotel and the screen just made it difficult to get a clear picture.. . For families, it is convenient to things children would want to go to like Excalibur.  It is connected to Luxor and Excalibur so you don't have to walk outside during the summer months.    There are many places to eat.  Mandalay Bay is connected to the Four Seasons Hotel, which also has some fancy places to eat.. . The service here was great.  Since for booking to room, we had two different reservations because of the myvegas rewards, we didn't have to go downstairs to check out and check in, it was done automatically.  They have Wi-Fi available in the rooms for up to 4 devices, there was a restricted amount of data that was for free, but I don't how they keep track of that.  . . My boyfriend order room service and surprised me with a bottle of champagne and... proposed!  I took off one star because they got my last name wrong, but it does add some humor to the whole story!  I would like to stay again.  Trying to get both nights for free.  (You can use 3 myvegas rewards in a 30 day period).
I stayed for a whole week at this resort and fell in love!! Sure- there were a couple things I would change about it, but over all- I would absolutely stay here again and again. . . The room was clean! Wow. Hard to find a comfortable bed with good linens, but not at Mandalay. The bath tubs are huge!! Every room has one too. I would recommend upgrading to a suite if a promotion is going. Totally worth it. . . The service here is what got me- everyone is extremely friendly and will go out of there way for you. Being that I was there for a whole week, I encountered many different people. From valet, to the restaurants to show tickets- everyone was great! . . Room service was very tasty - pricey but delicious. It will take time so order in advance. . . The best part of this resort is the lazy river!!!!!! I am NOT a pool person but I fell in love with this one. Wow. Talk about heaven on earth.  Bring your own inner-tube or else you have to buy one for $25 (no renting). Do not go in the lazy river without one or else you are missing out. Get a drink, a big hat and float. It's amazing. Hours just slip by. . . Mandalay and THE hotel are both clean, friendly and high end (without the snobby attitude). I am a life long fan!!
This seems to be a trend with Mandalay Bay and their promises. My friend and I went back to Mandalay Bay for the weekend as they promise to make things right the second time around. We had a trip to Arizona so we decided to stay in Las Vegas for one night and use the comp room they gaved us. We booked the room back in June and on Monday of the weekend we were heading out, I called in to confirm. I was garauntee that we would have the same type of room we had last time which was 2 queen size beds. When we checked in on Saturday after a 9 hour drive, they put put me in a king size room. I told the lady at the front desk that I was promised 2 queen size when I called to confirm. The only option I could have is either a 2 queen size room that was for smokers or a king size room with a roll out bed.I had no choice but to compromise and accept the king size bedroom.. We went up to floor 25 room 108. We checked the room and there was no left over food, bugs or power problem like the last time we visited. We just got back visiting antelope canyon in vegas so the first thing we did was to take a shower. While my friend was taking her shower, I turn on the tv and there was no signal. The tv is still an issue just like our last visit, only instead of it flikering from the power saving mode, it is not showing any channels at all. When my friend was done with her shower, she came out and informed me that the water in the shower wont go down and is basically flowing out of the shower. Angry, I called the front desk and told them what happened and they told me that they will send over a technician. I demanded to speak to a manager as I was really upset because nothing seems to had change from the last time I was here, even though they told me otherwise. I believe the manager I spoke to was name Susan, and I told her exactly what has happened. We were promised over the phone on Monday that we will get 2 queen size beds, the tv has no signal whatsover, and now theres a flood happening in the bathroom. While I was on the phone with her, I instructed my friends to head down first and use the $100 comp we had while I get our room issue fix. the option to use the $100 is very limited and we decided to use it on the noodle but they are way overprice and not good. $17 for wonton soup and $20ish for pad thai. the engineer came and pretty much snake into the drainage to clear up the clog. Both the engineer and the manager informed me that the tv losing signal is a known issue and would be resolved in a few hours. Like the front desk, she says the only thing she can do is to put us in a smoking optional room that has 2 queen beds. After 2 or 3 more minutes with her on the phone, she offered us to stay in a bigger suite free of charge as our current room are having issues. I agreed so long as she personally go to the suite she is moving us to and personally inspect it to make sure there is no more issues. She agreed and told me she will sent some1 to pick up our luggage. I waited by myself for 15-20 minutes before giving up and calling front desk in which they reply that some1 will be there shortly as they were delayed for a bit. the manager susan then personally came up to my room to hand me my new keys and inform me that she did do a check and everything is good to go.. Finally got the luggage at the new suite at floor 28 room 108. Did a quick inspection and everything seems to check out. Another issued I had was after I have finish getting our bags to the new room, all my friends has finished eating and came back up, so I had basically stayed behind nearly half hour+ getting this issued fix. I was hungry, I was dirty from the desert, I was tired as i only slept 3 hours the last 48 hours. I finally went and took my shower but heres the worst part. i had closed the door to the bathroom door, turned around and as I was undressing, the bathroom door does not close and therefore, everyone on the bed was able to see me naked. I had to use a tower to wedge the door shut. After the shower, we head out, but because of how crapy i felt fromt his whole ordeal, I went back after an hour to rest up while the rest of my friend's continue to party without me. I went back to the front desk to complain and this time they brought another manager name Kristen. She said she will sent another engineer up to fix the door issue.the engineer came and fix the door. I went to sleep at 12 and my friends came back at 2. While they were getting ready for bed, both sink were clog. I was too tired at that point to complain again. Next morning, I checked out and ask to speak with Kristen again but she was already off duty. The manager there got my number and informed me that he will personally give her my number so she can contact me to work something out. That was 10am and when I got back home in Los Angeles at 9pm, no one has called me. i called back and Kristen informed me that no one informed her to call me back.this trip was by far the least enjoyable
We didn't actually stay at the hotel but the Michael Jackson show was there. If you haven't seen this show then you are definitely missing out.  I was hesitant at first because the tickets were $200 bucks a piece. Very glad I bought the tickets. This show is the best I have ever seen in my life. I have always liked Michael Jackson and his music but ever since attending this show I have been TEAM MICHAEL JACKSON. Best show EVER!!!
The resort and casino is great and high end. I have had every need and want taken care of and the staff are always available and willing to give suggestions for the best restaurants and night clubs. . The casino has been very friendly to me and are willing to give up the money. The main pool is big and they have a real sand beach. Recommend this resort highly.
Love this hotel, and the pool area.. . Check in was horrible though. Took 45 minutes. Long went into the casino and only 3 employees checking guests in. 5 managers sitting behind encounter all chatting and looking at their cell phones. Finally an angry customer went up to them and chewed them out and they opened an additional 2 terminals and the line started moving.. . Hotel room was clean, strip view was amazing. Bathroom was really big with hot tub and private toilet. Room service was 24 hrs and actually pretty cheap.. . Pool was amazing. I've stayed at the HOTEL and used this pool before. It's a beach style pool with sand, a lazy river, and 3 additional pools. Awesome drinks, and music.. . Casino is extreme and large, and smells like flowers. I like that you can't smell cigarette smoke. Would definitely stay here again.
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #3:. Mandalay Bay = this place may be my favorite of all of them; first of all, it's huge - you can get totally lost roaming around the convention/ballroom area; plus it is attached to The Delano (formerly THE Hotel), which is still being finished but you can already sense the chill & casually hip vibe, and attached to The Four Seasons, which is high-end without being stuffy (check out their beautiful pool/gardens area); the casino is not overwhelming, and the focus seems to be more on the awesome restaurants & bars; plus The House of Blues lives here; Mandalay Place has fun shops and good, affordable eats & drinks; by the way, the ladies generally look smoking hot, especially those headed into Light nightclub; best craft beer bet = Burger Bar (in Mandalay Place; their selection is as good as it gets on The Strip)
We loved it here! The rooms are really clean and the pool/beach is awesome. We are ending our vacation here and wish we would've skipped Monte Carlo because it was disgusting there. Only disappointing thing was the staff in the casino area. They all seemed a little miserable and lacked enthusiasm. Half of them were walking around looking at their cell phones and one of the dealers told everyone at the table that they needed to refrain from cussing. It made everyone feel a little strange...since we were in a casino with only adults and in a city filled with sin. And one of the managers on duty said that they don't allow cussing so that was a little amusing to us. All in all great time!
I absolutely loved this hotel. I have been to Vegas a ton of times and have stayed in the MGM Signature Towers, Encore, Luxor, and other hotels. I think this is my favorite hotel so far. . . What I loved about this place:. 1. The "Beach" It's huge. THEY HAVE SAND! The sand has a ton of lawn chairs and faces the wave pool. They also have a lazy pool (bring your own inner tube it is $20 to rent theirs) that is relaxing. There are several other pools with lawn chairs. There are some areas where you can find shade without being under a cabana but not many. I have been to other hotels where there is not one tree by the pool.. 2. The rooms are nice and comfortable with a double sinks in the bathroom. If you are there with your girlfriends you appreciate the double sinks. The bathroom also has a soaking tub in addition to a shower.. 3. The restaurants that are connected to the hotel are great. Burger Bar has a happy hour with half off mojitos. The House of Blues has a great breakfast menu. You almost don't have to leave the hotel.. . I would have easily given this hotel five stars if it wasn't for the mistake with billing. I reserved my room online with a AAA discount and paid the deposit. When I checked in I paid the remaining balance which included the $28/day resort fee. The money was taken out of my account immediately. When I checked my account two days later the money was back in but the resort fee was out. When I called and spoke to a representative at the front desk the gentleman told me that they were holding an extra $125 for incidentals which I informed them I did not need at check in. He told me that if he released the extra being charged it may hold my account up for double the cost. The next day I went to the lobby and spoke to a woman at the front desk who was not apologetic at all. She actually told me that I could have dinner in the hotel for the extra $125 that was being held on my card. All I wanted was to be charged the correct amount. She then told me that her manager would tell me the same thing so there was no need to speak to her. Of course I asked to speak to her manager who fixed the extra charges. I just wish I didn't have to waste time on the phone a couple times and in person trying to get this corrected.. . I will stay here again.
