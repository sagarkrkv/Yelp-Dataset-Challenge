When you think decadent, over the top, spectacular looking desserts, this kind of sweet spot comes to mind. The choice were overwhelming (next time will try gelato). It's a patisserie first so I focused my attention to the pretty looking baked goods. I'm a key lime fanatic so this was my selection. Happy to share it's the best rendition I've ever had. Despite the green coloring (I know it's for show, but real key limes are yellow looking), the texture, flavor notes and execution were spot on.. . I also got a bite of the opera cake, though not a chocolate fan, I found this quite tasty since it was layered and assembled beautifully.. . The location is tucked away in the casino in Aria, but it's worth finding. A sure win while in Vegas.
In love with their gelato! Best gelato of my life. This place lights up my day and leaves me with a smile. It was a hot day and I really needed something sweet!. . I got the coconut and hazelnut gelato in a white chocolate cone. Craving satisfied! I think bc they actually give you huge scoops it got too sweet. I was better off getting 1 scoop but I wanted 2 flavors!. . I wish this place opened up in California! I guess this gives me a reason to come back to Vegas bc of their gelato!
Ordered a banana nut muffin, received a blueberry muffin. When I spoke with the manager, she rudely asked me if I wanted blue berry or banana, when clearly I'm returning to exchange the blue berry muffin. . . Food was decent, just poor attitude/service when confronted about the issue of an error on their part.. . Probably would not come back to this specific location.
The dessert here was out of this world! I ordered the rose macaroon and it was so good that every time I took a bite, it was like I forgot how good it was and was impressed all over again. I also bought the marshmallows to take home. I had food allergies and this was the first time I've seen marshmallows without corn syrup -- they were so light, airy, heavenly, and unlike any "marshmallow" I remember having 10+ years ago. My friend got the chocolate gelato, which was also amazing. On top of this, the service was stellar and the store had beautiful displays. I wish they would open a location in NYC!
It's always a treat to stay at Aria what with their modern and chic rooms to all their amazing dining options.  Jean Phillippe Patisserie is amongst another great reason to stay at Aria!. . JPP serves up and sells some of the most decadent treats ever.  From little pastries like cinnamon buns and cake pops to boxes of gourmet and fancy chocolates, what can't you get here?  They have delicious crepes, a wide selection of gelato, sandwiches, salads, et cetera.After a night of drinking and such, it's always an amazing treat to buy yourself a sweet and devour it in the comfort of your room.. . The lines are ridiculously long here especially on weekends at breakfast.  If you're smart, buy your pastries the day before and hide it in your room because the wait can be pretty ridiculous.  If you got to have their quiche though, brave the wait.  It's worth it!. . Also, don't forget to check out their display/exhibit at the side of their store.  It's always changing and always huge, detailed, and made from chocolate!  Their Bellagio location features the "world's largest  chocolate fountain" as well so hop onto that monorail and head over to Bellagio for a peek.
I was at the aria for 2 days and i ate lunch and dinner there for two days. Great sandwiches, convenient to the room locations. The best coffee is the americano, if you like strong coffee with a pick me up, da best!!!
Disclaimer: I was NOT HAPPY with the service at all, but the delicious dessert made up for it.. . Definitely Try:. 1. White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake - OH MY HEAVEN, BEST WHITE CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE OF MY LIFE. The raspberries are delightfully fresh, the white chocolate is not overly sweet, and the graham cracker center is DEEEEELICIOUS (I am drooling as I type). . 2. Banana Nut Breakfast Muffin - NOM NOM NOM with real pieces of Banana which are soft and delicious when the muffin is toasted!. . Good, but skip. 1. Granola and Yogurt - this was really good, but I didn't think it was worth the price because I've had yummy homemade granola and yogurt for half the price ($7.50 or $8.50 - I don't remember exactly)
I had a rose water macroon. It was nothin outta this world i made better ones in culinary school. The pastry cream didnt have much flavor. Its definately over priced i dont think its cause its vegas more like you put a french name on it and it magically doubles in price. Its a pretty cute place to just hang out have a coffee or somethin. Maybe other things are delish i just wouldnt recommend the macroon. Hopefully you get somethin delicious.. . Shouldve tried there muffins they were size of jupiter n looked scruptious. But im too fluffy to have more then one dessert. :/
talk about luxury plastic utensils!! i secretly stashed a handful in my bag because they were so pretty. . . now onto the crepe, i got the chicken breast one!! yummm!! make sure to eat it all while it's still hot or else it gets a little nauseating. i also shared it with my sister because i knew i couldn't finish one by myself. . . the whole place is so chic and modern. lurv it
A fun place to buy pastries and chocolate treats as you're perusing through Aria.
This is a very nice patisserie at theAria in Las Vegas. I really enjoyed everything I ate here very much. The sandwiches and pastries are fantastic, fresh and delicious. The coffee and cappuccino is near perfect.
The almond croissants are everything! I would weigh 400 lbs if I lived near this bakery.
Tastes like disappointment. . . I've given this place a try a couple of times for their desserts and gelato. . . Pastries were ok. Flan was ugly (yes, appearance does factor in!!) and had a weird texture. The opera and Nutella cake were too sweet. . . The gelato, however, was a tragedy. Texture was very hard. I had Oreo which was not mixed well enough, divided nearly in perfect half with one side being vanilla and the other Oreo mixture. Creme brulee and rocky road were better, though still not nearly creamy enough to be considered a good gelato. . . Perhaps I should stick to eating French/Italian desserts only in Europe.. . Unfortunately for Vegas this is the only decent French sweets shop around.
Cheesecake was okay but not the best. I had the dessert trio and the raspberry macaroon was my favorite out of the three.
My husband and I just got backfrom staying at the Aria. On our last day I went down to get us some food from this place, to bring back up to our hotel room. After waiting almost half an hour, dealing with the rude obnoxious people behind the counter, and the highly overpriced food that was not worth it, I would never eat here again. The girl behind the counter was so rude to customers while I was waiting. One lady was circling just to peek at what was in the containers, and she was barked at to get back, there's is a line. I heard the woman explain to her husband how rude that was. She was right. Another man was just peeking, and wasn't sure where the line was, because it is not clearly marked, and she barked at him too. For how much we have to spend per night to stay at this hotel, I was appalled at the service here. Completely unprofessional and rude. Your food isn't worth half the price you are charging, and your service ruins everything for everyone. We have a lot of friends that are planning on staying at the Aria, and I will make sure each and every one of them knows about how terrible the service was here.
The store is amazing and the chocolate fountain is awesome. This review is for the customer service. . I have never been here before and asked the cashier "how sweet are your iced mochas?" The response "well it's chocolate." Great! I know that. Are we talking one pump? Two pumps? Am I going to walk away diabetic?! . . I know you are hating your life as every child in Vegas wants a gelato but for those of us who want coffee, AND don't want to drink a milkshake, put on a smile and pretend to give a sh*t about customer service. . . Thanks!
This location is better than the one in Bellagio. Better seating, more space to browse their goods, and they have heir different stations separated out more clearly. Basically it's not as congested in there. I can always count on them to have at least 10 different pastries I want to try and chocolates I want to buy!
The peanut lollipop is amazing! I highly recommend it. This restaurant also has a great view of the casino!
Writing this for my wife.  She has a serious sweet tooth.. . We had breakfast here too.  I didn't care for their crepes, but my wife had a ham & cheese crossiant and said it was amazing.
