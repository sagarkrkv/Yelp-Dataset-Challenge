i had to edit this review when i remembered how freezing i was. if it's 114 degrees outside, why would we feel comfortable at 70 degrees inside? we wouldn't. remember relative temperature and how hard it is for our bodies to acclimate. just raise the temperature by a few degrees! please! i shouldn't have to bring out my winter wardrobe to fly to vegas in the summer.. . [resume post]. easy peezy. used southwest's online boarding and cruised right through security. everyone was cool and relaxed. . . hot tip: restaurants cant solicit tips at this airport, but they do appreciate them. i asked, as i at least like to drop my change in the tip jar! my purse was getting heavy and so i learned of the airport rule against leaving tip jars on display. . . restaurant selection is great. nice assortment of shops. i ate at pei wei diner: delicious. . . when i was at this aiport on my arrival at 7am lots of the restaurants and shops were closed. that was a bummer, as i had time to browse before catching my ride. ended up at a starbucks. . . oh--i would love it if the airport turned the volume down by the baggage claim and pick up areas. crazy making if you're on the phone.
I like this airport, easy to navigate, the slot machines make me smile.  There seem to be more restaurants here than any other airport.  The food was good in all areas, restrooms were clean and there are pleanty of them.
This is the greatest airport, hands down. I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes in line. I've also never interacted with any employee that wasn't quite nice. It's super easy to navigate as well. They have this business down to a science.
TSA employees are some of the rudest that I have encountered. It felt like I was checking into a prison. Food and drink choices are lacking, mostly overpriced fast food. Not that one goes to the airport to eat, still, they could try a little harder. Very long walk from security to the gates in Terminal One.
Good set up. free wifi comfortable waiting area
Where else can you step off the plane and go right to the slot machines? Yup, McCarran is your stop of choice if you're hooked on gambling! Machines EVERYWHERE! I'm not the gambling sort, so there wasn't much appeal there for me.
Ok, I don fly much so I might not be that keen on airport stuff. It seemed so spread out. From a shuttle bus perspective it's a nightmare. There's miles of roads and a dozen exists and as many entries. . It looked like the cohesiveness was good between all the separate  entities but who knows. . Bottom line for me... Got in, got out with all my stuff on time. Sweet.
Really convenient to get to via cab, and they have most everything you could want expect perhaps enough places to sit and wait for your flight at the gate (and nap pods, which I still demand should become a thing at all airports).  . . It's novel and fun to be able to gamble in the airport while you wait.  Lots of shops and amusements for you to waste time at, too.  Could do with a bit more serious dining, but such is life. . . The free wifi is really nice.
Definitely one of the more entertaining airports I have been in (maybe the most entertaining?!). The strip was easy to get to from the airport and there were plenty of cabs and shuttles even on July 4th weekend.  . If you have extra cash at the end of your stay (idk how you would, but...) You can always play slots while you wait for your flight :) . . Minus one for crappy food. Come on why was only one tiny little sub place open at six thirty pm, prime dinner time??
There is just something about me that does not like this airport. I'm going to attribute that to fact that i'm normally super happy when i'm arriving into town and just not as happy when i'm leaving town. Food wise, there's a decent selection. There's slot machines and alcohol available, which are all bonuses. But, this place just isn't clean. Honestly it sort of gives me the heebee jeebees thinking about what diseases could be lingering on the nasty carpet. Pair that with some outdated bathrooms and the stench of cigarette smoke and that's about all it takes to make it one of the less-than-desirable places on earth. I'm so sorry if you ever have a long delay or a long layover here.
Probably one of the most entertaining airports.  You can eat until you explode, drink it up, play slot machines, try to catch a nap after a long weekend in Vegas, or just simply people watch.  I think the people watching part is the most entertaining because you literally see all kinds of people with so many different agendas.  If you are flying out of this airport, I highly recommend getting there at least two hours early.  The security lines can be insane, especially on a busy weekend.  If you are flying into the airport, I recommend getting one of the shuttles to your hotel as the taxi lines can be like the line to Space Mountain at Disneyland on a weekend in the Summer.  I've stood in line for a taxi for over an hour before.  It's not the lack of taxis as the line is constantly moving, it's just the sheer number of people who need a taxi.  The flights into Vegas are always hilarious because you will likely sit near someone who has never been to Vegas is convinced they are going to have a wild weekend and keep on tossing back cocktails on the plane to pre-party.  To each their own.
Do your best to fly in to Terminal 3 (by which I mean fly United, because that's the biggest purveyor at T3).. . In T3, there's tons of shiny new restaurants, places to sit and clean restrooms. You'll find all sorts of gifts to get for people who you forgot to buy things for while you were gambling until 6am after your third trip to the ATM and you'll be able to buy water to chug to help get rid of the over-oxygenated hangover. . . What I'm saying is it's a solid terminal.. . Fly in to terminals 1 or 2? You won't spend much time on arrival, but when you're leaving it will be you and the people who are slowly coming to grips with how much money they've lost, the depraved sexual acts they've committed or the quantity of alcohol they've imbibed. Those people are in Terminal 3, too, but in 1 and 2 the drab carpet, the cramped space and the lack of places to sit/restaurants to hide in paint a depressing Nic Cage kind of portrait for all those leaving Las Vegas.. . But, I mean, c'mon. When you're booking a trip to Vegas what terminal you fly into is the last of your worries. Just keep it in mind when you're flying home drunk, broke and full of great stories wondering why you can't find anywhere to sit down.
Our bags arrived swiftly. This airport is entertaining and wasn't too crowded either. This airport seems easy to navigate.
I come through Vegas a few times a year and this airport gets me through efficiently.  While not the cleanest or prettiest, it does what it's supposed to do; namely, get you where you want to go without any hassle.  There's not a Starbuck's at every terminal but there are some decent places to eat.  Hello Jamba Juice!  Make sure you know if there's a big event if you're staying in Vegas.  UFC, boxing, or whatever can make things move slowly.  . My main reason for the 3 star rating is the ridiculous taxi line at arrival.  With as much tourist traffic as they receive you would think they would have a better system for grabbing a cab.  Hell, there's enough money running through those casinos to put a train to the strip.  As it is, you get herded like cattle through a VERY long line.  Really, imagine what you to consider a long line and picture that in your head.  Can you see it?  Now multiply that by 5 and you might get close.  Only major fail for the airport but it's a pretty big one and a great way to put visitors in a bad mood.
Nowhere can you find outlets to charge phones or tablets!!  What's up with that?  This place is 15 years behind in making improvements that passengers need and want. I found one "charging station" that made it look like they were doing us a favor by providing a dozen outlets in one very small area. It's still fun to come here, but abandon hope ye who are low on battery life.
Ok this is the way to get to Vegas, and this is the tourist mecca.  It was glitzy years ago but is now a bit divey and not so easy to get around.  I am not sure how else you would get to Vegas unless you want to brave the drive but the airport will not be the highlight of your trip.
I love flying to and from this airport because it is close to the strip, so the taxi fee is under $20 with tip, and it has a fast moving pace.  I fly through JetBlue when I mostly come to Vegas with the ease and convenience of knowing that I am in a no hassle free zone.  I can come at least 15 minutes prior to my boarding time and have the right amount of time to check-in and go through security even on a Sunday.  So if you want to fly to Vegas, feel free and relaxed when you come to this airport. Leave your worries behind because it's Vegas baby!
Not a big Vegas fan but Southwest uses this airport for connections so you get no choice if the right flight is passing through here. Food, as anyone who Yelps it here, is abysmally bad, and whomever inspects the health and sanitation  should be fired for letting these culinary charnel houses operate. If you can avoid eating here DO. If you can't then woe unto ye, for all hope is lost. The slot machines are well kept up. Perhaps airport management should get the food providers back on their game.
Quick Summary: If you're spending time in the Vegas airport, you're doing it wrong.. . I've had the joy of coming through McCarran plenty of times, especially since I've decided it is not worth it to drive to Vegas anymore... and for an airport it isn't that bad. . . When you're departing, I find that security is fairly quick. I've never spent more than 20min in line, without TSA pre-check. The terminal can get pretty long so be prepared to hustle if you've got a gate at the end and running a bit short on time. They've got free wifi, without downloading an app or watching a video, which is really nice. They've got a good variety of shops that seem to be open at all odds of hours and they've upped the number of charging stations available.. . And if you didn't have enough of throwing your money away, they have slots available throughout... I'm more a table game sort of guy myself, but I think it's more for the novelty of being in Vegas than anything else. If you've got time to play slots in the airport... refer to my quick summary.. . When you're arriving, things seem to flow pretty quickly, though to be honest, I don't ever check a bag going to Vegas so I can't speak to that aspect.  One BIG NOTE: if you're taking a taxi onto the strip. Anywhere on the strip from the Mandalay Bay to the Wynn, DO NOT agree to take the freeway/highway.  They're gouging you. The airport authorities have taken notice of this gouging and have started to post signs and what not... but they still try. Take Paradise / surface streets. It's much faster and cheaper. You shouldn't have to pay more than $20 for anywhere on the strip.. . All in all, it's a decent airport... no real thrills or frills... aside from the slots... I would have expected some more lights... some glitz... maybe a little glamour to welcome you to Sin City... but then again... why are you hanging out in the airport in VEGAS?!
I love this airport. I only fly using jet blue so it is very easy to get in and out of. There is always taxis and car service ready to pick you up if you havent made prior arrangements.
Clean and well laid-out. Good options for food and shopping.. . Just what you want from an airport!
I fly here regularly and the only complaint I have is the fact that the A/C doesn't seem to be on. It's 110 outside, it should be full blast! Think of us Canadians who aren't used to the heat
I hadn't realized how close The Strip is the McCarran airport...until I was in Vegas in May. When I landed my shuttle came quickly and I was at my hotel in about 10 minutes. . . On arrival I was at the airport pretty late, so I didn't get to see much of it then. Departing I got to see a bit more of the terminal (the international one since I was flying back to Canada). I loved the look of the terminal, it was bright and airy, and the departure screens by the gate were pretty cool. Being Vegas there were slot machines, but only about half were working (the others looked new like they hadn't been set up yet). I lost my last $6 on the slots at the airport, but I won't hold that against the airport. . . There is free wifi, which was nice, but not a lot of plugins. The airport, or the terminal I was in, didn't have much for restaurants - there might have been two or three...it would have been nice to get a bit more choice, but for an hour or two to wait before a flight there certainly are worst airports out there.
This was my home for about two years. I worked here as a member of the tsa so I know some of the ins and outs of this place. . . The staff here aside from the tsa are, for the most part are friendly and are willing to help out with whatever questions you may have about anything you may have such as where the taxis and busses are. There are also many signs that can point you in the right direction. . . Many people come here from different countries as well. There is a stand for currency exchange. Another neat feature that this airport has and that is a gym. If you need to work out they have a gym that allows you get your swoll on. . . There are many forms of entertainment as well. I have been stuck waiting for my friends and family and have not been bored. There are many ads shown on many super big screen tvs which is great to watch. Also if you are older than 21 then there are rows of slot machines as well that you can play. . . There are plenty of food courts as well that have a bunch of your more common fast food joints such as Wendy's and popeye's. This review gets half a star off because of the price of the food is stupidly excessive but what can you do when that's the only food you can reach. There are also convenience kiosks that can help you which are not as expensive. . . Now the other reason for the next half star is due to getting to the airport. The roadways to get to the airport are so very confusing. If I did not work there I would have gotten lost. The roads all twist and turn on each other. I have gotten lost a couple of times before I started working there and have learned from my mistakes and yet they keep adding more and more roads leading to this wondrous airport. . . They have also finished building t3 which is a new addition to this airport for certain Airlines. I have had the privilege of working there for a while before leaving their employ. T3 is very clean and the decorations are very modern. If you can try to leave out of this terminal. . . Now for the tsa. People always bash on them and I understand why. Passengers tend to group all of them together and I must say that not all of us are mean and messed up. Also you should not believe all that you see in the media. . . To make your passage through the tsa as Smooth as possible please listen to what they say. There should be an officer that tells people what to do before entering the check point. Listen to that person they are telling you how to get through with no problems such as removing everything from your pockets. Do that and all should be good. Also there are tvs with directions as well.  Remember there are no bottles of water so drink them outside the check point. . . If you have any questions you can go ahead and just message me if you need any me questions answered and I will help out with what I can. There is also a lost and found if you happen to have lost something.
May sound a bit harsh, but even if i'm not comparing to other airports, it can't stand alone to be a 3-star.. . Not many food options; no McDonald's for heaven's sake.. . Not many shopping, different boutiques---unless you count three Hudson's!  . . Thank goodness there's wifi and a few more charging stations, that's the 2nd star lol.
"Never Had A Problem!". This airport is very well ran! The baggage claim is very fast here! Everytime I have flown into this place I have never had any issues! I will say though that it's huge! So getting lost can be easy! Just follow the signs and you will be fine!
Not all the electrical outlets at the Recharge Zone work (located in between gates C7 and C14).
I'll start with the good. Baggage check-in and security were both smooth and easy. There is free WiFi, which made waiting four hours for my flight infinitely more bearable. This is the most aesthetically pleasing airport I have been to, as would be expected of an airport in a touristy city like Vegas. Some parts are quite detailed, and it is well decorated overall; the slot machines scattered across the airport give it a nice, "Vegas-ish" feel. . . Here's the bad. The line at security can be long at times, and considering how heavily trafficked Vegas is, they could use more security staff. Also, there isn't a whole lot to eat, and the limited variety of food that is there is considerably more expensive than any airport I have visited. These few negative aspects only took away from my overall experience slightly, though; it is still the nicest experience I have had at any airport.
Too confusing, too much walking, & don't take the taxi can they will rip you off. From the airport to Orleans we were charged $29.10!! Rip off cuz the guy went on the freeway and circled all around back to Tropicana then to Orleans Hotel!. . Just because it was two old fart females he took advantage of us!. . And this airport, what up with all the walking?  And the empty spaces?
Had a positive experience on a Sunday. Road the Showtime shuttle from the Luxor which got us here in plenty of time to game and pick up snacks for the flight.   I didn't have any issues with the wi-if.
This airport can be extremely crowded. Get here at least two hours early or risk missing your flight. That being said, they have lots of great places to eat and shop.
Airports are airports. This one is very clean and it seems to have food and gift shops at roughly each gate section area; Starbucks and other fast food joints. The one thing I do not like about this airport is the USO is located outside of security and being military this is a bit of a drawl back because it is nice to be able to go through security and then crash at the USO until my flight because then I have no worries of getting held up. With it being outside of security that is not the case.
This place is amazeballs. If you are stuck here late at night there is a Ruby's that stays open until 12 PM. Plenty of places to plug in your phone or laptop and friendly staff makes this one of my favorite airports, even if I lost the bank in vegas!
The airport is easy to navigate and is a tad dated...ok, a lot dated.  That being said, there is nothing better than getting off the plane with a bunch of other people that are all about to make as many questionable decisions as you are!  That is the #1 reason that this Airport is the best!  You are looking across the baggage carousel at other guys and girls that you may or may not see at the club getting absolutely WHITE GIRL WASTED!!!  I Love Vegas!  It is by far, my favorite place to be when on vacation with friends!  This airport is when you start the journey of EPICNESS!!!!!!!!!!
Also known as "The airport with the slot machines!"  It's a good airport on the whole.  Better than LAX.  Last time I was there, they had me go thru the minimum security checkpoint.  Not sure why, maybe I just have an honest face.  But, smoking is allowed in there and it makes the whole place stink.  I'm one of those guys who just wants to run screaming in the opposite direction whenever I smell cigs or am standing near a smoker.
McCarran International Airport may not be the only airport in Las Vegas but it is definitely the closest to the strip.  It is less than a mile away and depending where you're staying it can be a $20 or so cab ride to your hotel.  . . When flying in you can have a great view of the strip as long as you sit on the right side of the plane.  Departures are not as impressive in terms of view of the strip but again the right side of the plane provides the best opportunity for photos.  . . McCarran International Airport is probably the only airport that has slot machines.  That was the first thing I noticed when I stepped off the plane and into the terminal.  Nothing like getting a taste of Vegas before you even leave the airport.  This is also inviting for those who want to test their luck at the end of a exciting weekend in Vegas.  . . The airport is clean and well managed.  It is not too confusing.  I believe there is a monorail system that will take you to the baggage claim but I did not use it.  It was bit of a walk but nothing too crazy.  The baggage claim area is quite lively with more slot machines, large billboard like advertisements, video boards with ads and audio to go with them.  It definitely gets you into the mood well before you've even step foot on the strip.  . . McCarran International Airport is fitting for Vegas and extremely conveniently located.
Really not a good airport.  Las Vegas is built around you, the customer, and a good experience should be had at the place most likely to be your first and last impression of the city.. . Just walk up and down the airside for Southwest and you'll see 20+ people sitting on the floor at nearly every gate.  My wife had to sit on the floor when she was pregnant because none of the hung over people also waiting for the flight would give up their seat.  Would it really be that difficult for the airport to install additional seating?. . The security lines are horrible on a regular basis.  Fortunately TSA Pre Check has helped with that a lot, but most people don't have that yet and will still get stuck in the long line.. . The McCarran baggage claim is ripe with criminals stealing luggage.  The airport also has woefully inadequate security camera coverage of the baggage claim area.  My wife and I had our bags stolen in 2012; the criminals just took the first few bags to come off the belt, and with the very long walk from plane to claim, they were long gone before we had even gotten there to watch our own bags.  The police told us that the airport used to enforce a ticketed passenger only policy, but got rid of that for budgetary reasons in 2007/2008 time frame, so now anyone can come into the claim area.  They do have plain clothes police patrolling the area, but unless the same person comes to steal bags often enough, or is dumb enough to come in from outside and immediately take a bag versus coming in from the ticketing area so they appear to come from the airport side, they're not going to catch many thieves.  The cameras the airport had also had no record of the people taking our bags; no view of the belt in question, no view of the exits they apparently used.  How do I know the bags were stolen and the airline didn't just lose them?  Because we found the criminals by way of them trying to sell our belongings at a used clothing store; they confessed to stealing them off the belt.. . Food-wise, the slightly better than fast food eating options in the airport have all proven to be poor to below average.  The food is typically not good, and the drinks are very expensive and not very strong.  I'd recommend eating before arriving and just buy a $4.50 bottle of water once you're through security.  Oh yeah, typically all the tables will be taken, so you'll probably be eating your food off the floor just like you'll be doing when waiting for your plane.. . Finally, I hope you're not catching a cab.  The cab line is outside, which is really pleasant in the 100 degree heat.  Once you work your way to an available cab, the airport charges higher than average fees for cabs to do pickups (compared to other airports), so a rip the customer off mentality has developed amongst the cab drivers.  With the confusing exits from the airport, the cab drivers have become professionals at taking longer routes out that seem to be the most ideal way to go.  You'll pay a few dollars more and if you had not known better, would be none the wiser.  I've had to start telling drivers explicitly that I want them to take certain streets on the way to where I'm going.
As with the majority of establishments in Vegas, you'll see a bunch of slot machines throughout the airport.  Flying in to McCarran has always been convenient, but as expected, trying to get a cab can sometimes take upwards to an hour just to get through the line.  This sucks especially much when it's blazing hot in the summer.  My suggestion is to either get a bus/shuttle that you can prepay, or have a friend pick you up.  . . The other option is renting a car which I had to learn the hard way.  There are a bunch of car rental places, offsite, that a shuttle can take you to.  It's easy, and only about a 10 minute bus ride.  Follow the signs.  HOWEVER, beware, there are some car rental places even FURTHER away.  To get to them you have to take the car rental shuttle to the car rental building, and then hop off and on a DIFFERENT shuttle to the other car rental places.  If you're in any type of rush (going in or returning the car), factor this in and check where your car rental place actually is.  Typically the lower budget ones are the ones that require two shuttles.. . Leaving McCarran is pretty simple as long as you know which terminal your airlines is at.  There are two and they have different entrances.  Your taxi driver should know, but if not, you should check ahead of time. . . I've generally not had any issues flying out of McCarran.  There were a few times that the security line was ridiculously long, usually on Sundays, and it can take 45 minutes to get through.  But most of the times it's pretty easy, and there are a bunch of small food restaurants to eat at.  Also of course, there are the infamous dollar hungry slot machines...as if you haven't lost enough already.
Every time I've been here it's been so easy to fly! Barely any lines for security. Love that there is a separate area for pick up. Just take the short tram ride to baggage claim, go down the escalators, and follow signs to passenger pick up (towards the back right if you're facing baggage claim). Really easy to get picked up, and the cars there have never been crowded. It is a bit of a walk to get there, but hey a little exercise never hurt any body!
