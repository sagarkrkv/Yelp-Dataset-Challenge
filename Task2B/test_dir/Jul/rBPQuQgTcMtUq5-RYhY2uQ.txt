This place is ok.  It's 2ed to the Ceaser's palace buffet in my eyes.  I love the environment setting here just because it feels like outside dining. Other then that the food is somewhat quality and it's a good experience.
One of the best and affordable buffets on the strip! The service was tremendous and the food quality is honestly what you pay for.
The Le Village Buffet is not the greatest buffet in Las Vegas. I mean it is only $30 for dinner, but still might as well spend it somewhere else.. . The food was okay, nothing great. There was an okay selection but nothing out of the ordinary. The highlight was probably the crepes, but even then the crepes you can get at Jean Philippe is so much better. The macaroons were so stale and the rest of the desserts didn't really taste that great.. . The environment is probably the best thing about the buffet because it looks really cool and unique from all the other buffets. Still probably not a good enough reason to pay so much for only subpar food. . . Customer service was very friendly and nice.. . Overall, just splurge a bit more and go to Bachannal or the Wynn to enjoy a great buffet in Vegas. How often do you get to go to Vegas?
Service... Anyone??. . This is the second time I've had the same waitress located in one of the middle rooms (skinny middle-aged woman). The host sat us down and told us to wait for the server to get our drinks. So, like well-behaved students we sat...and waited...and waited some more for our waitress to come over. I was literally watching her as she went from empty table to empty table to set up the plates and utensils when literally there were other customers in the room who needed tending to. There weren't even new customers going to those tables that were being set up. We waited about 15 minutes before she randomly came over with juice and iced tea to our table which we did not even order. It took about another 20 minutes before we were even served water and coffee, but no coffee cups. Once the room started to become filled, she took everyone else's order first, before coming to our table to finally ask what we wanted to drink even though we were there before about 90% of the other tables. It was just SOOO ridiculous.. . The previous time we came about 6 months prior, we had the same lady. She gave us attitude when we wanted 1 champagne and 1 juice for each person.  I don't understand why it was such a big issue when in the end she just gave us a jug of each. So simple, yet she had to make such a big deal out of it. Then, throughout the entire meal, she was giving us the stink eye.. . Food-wise: I would say it's just average. There's not a huge selection like Spice Market or Bacchanal. There was nothing that really stood out to me.. . Tip: If you do decide to come here, try to get a table that's not in the middle room, preferable a table in the main area. Service has always been better there. If you get seated in the middle room beg to be moved elsewhere. You've been warned!
Of the buffets we tried, this is one of the better ones.. . The seafood was iffy, but it always is at a buffet!. . I LOVE the sauteed mushrooms. I think I had thirds.. . We received a free glass of wine with our meals, which was a nice touch.. . Most of the staff doesn't speak  English very well, so that was super frustrating with a group of 12, since they were extremely worried about making sure we pre-paid the 18% gratuity. Needless to say, she was not tipped on top of that because the whole dibacle made us want to leave in the first place.
Stumbled in for breakfast while stating at Paris. The total rewards price is $20.99, which is a bit rich for what you get. . . The crepe station looked good and based on the feedback from a couple friends the crepes were quite delicious. But, there was a 15 minute wait which didn't seem worth it. . . I sampled the bagel and lox, oatmeal, pancakes, and fruit. All was mediocre. My main concern was the smell on some of the cantaloupe. It had a foul odor so it may have been old. . . The service was extremely lackluster. We had to flag down the waitress twice just to get more coffee. . . Overall, you get what you pay for. We could have gone to a bigger name breakfast buffet and paid $35, but we went here. In my opinion, it's not worth $20 and I won't be back.
After trying a couple of buffets in Vegas over various trips one of my friends had a coupon for here so we made a second round to what Paris's buffet had to offer during dinner.. . I wasn't super impressed the first time however we did arrive during the transition between brunch and dinner so I figured maybe not as many options were available.To my surprise I actually preferred brunch time since they had more dishes that catered to my personal tastes; eggs benidict and smoked salmon? That's pretty much all I need in my life with some good dessert haha. . . Everything in general is just kind of 'meh' and didn't feel it's worth the money. One of my friends was actually really disappointed with the place and wish we would have went elsewhere for our buffet fix.. . If you want some prime rib, turkey or stuffed lamb be prepared to wait in another pretty long line. The lamb was good but not that great. I can get soooooo much better lamb near where I live. My friends really enjoyed their prime rib but boyfriend said it wasn't the best he'd had either.. . There's never really a line for any of the other sections of the buffet. Potatoes are whatever...but like I said most things served here is medicore with nothing particularly standing out. And to my disappointment the dessert here was lacking. Come on, the french revolutionized patisserie! I would have expected a lot better. Oh well.. . . Overall I'd say if you're gonna go to a buffet go big and go to Bacchanal if you're really into your seafood (they had the best/freshest options for that department in my opinion) or I really enjoyed Bellagios (my personal favorite) buffet which had the most options overall at only $30 a person.
I would say this is a great choice for dinner buffet. There was a wide array of food choices.  There's was greek, asian, italian, and several other types of food. Everything looked fresh. My favorite part was dessert. Oh my goodness I thought I was going to have a food coma. So many tasty desserts and so delicately prepared. Our waitress was funny and always helpful. We never had to ask for refills on our drinks because she was always on the look out. I'm excited to return again so I can enjoy the dessert :-)
This USED to be one of the best breakfast buffets. I won't go again after today. The room we are in has wall paper peeling off in multiple places. We got a glass as our creamer,  made to order omlettes are good, but potatoes taste freezer burnt. The serving utensils at the buffet are sticky (gross!). Smoked salmon is good.. . Worst part... there are NO REAL Jams, jellies or preserves, only prepackaged cups of Smucker's which is all high fructose corn syrup. My impression is there was a major budget cut back and the quality has suffered greatly.
We went here for lunch based on a friend's recommendation. I'm usually not one to do a buffet in Vegas as I don't want to have that bloated feeling from overeating. Thankfully this buffet was full of delicious food that made me want to enjoy it and not just chow down to get my money's worth! . . The crepe station was probably my favorite. They have a list of savory and sweet options and they're all made fresh, however you want them. Bring a few bucks to tip these guys as they are quick and make really delicious crepes. The other areas are set up according to regions in France but if you're like most people it's just different food stations;) They had a good selection of different seafood such as clams, mussels, and shrimp. No crab legs for lunch though, bummer! . . They also have a nice salad area and make sure you save room for the dessert station! The macaroons were awesome and I believe there a few different flavors to try. Everything was great, the price was average fora buffet, and I didn't feel like a whale after eating at least 3-4 plates of delicious food! The buffet was not overwhelming as some can be. There were a lot of choices but not so many that I felt I had to try it all which is probably why other buffets have caused me to feel lethargic after eating at them. . . The service was a little off which is why I can't give them 5 stars. We were there with friends who were Diamond members who had already paid for everyone. When we arrived there was a host that was over-catering to another group and completely ignored us. When we tried to tell another host that we had already paid and just needed to find our group we had to repeat it several times and the host for some reason still could not understand and kept telling us to get in line and pay. It ended up that we finally ended up calling our friends to come out and meet us. After that debacle things got better and the waitstaff inside was very attentive.
Went there with a party of 11, we all gave this place a 10 plus. Everything was Delicious and we are all definitely coming back.
I was sadly disappointed by the rundowness of the buffet. The wallpaper on the walls and ceiling of the tables were chipped. Now let's talk about the food, the only thing that was good were the made to order crepes. The creme brulee was a cheap version, it really didn't taste like from relay on the sugar was barely there on top.  The feed basically was typical hotel food. In order to you get our money's worth we did he said he three pounds of crab.
We did a reservation on opentable for breakfast and good thing we did otherwise we would've had to wait for 30 minutes in line. When we went in, there were a lot of tables still empty so I don't really understand why their line was so long. Since we came in at 10:30, we got to experience both breakfast and lunch dishes.. . We came here because my mom desperately wanted to try their AYCE macarons. She said they were a disappointment because good macarons are supposed to melt in your mouth and their's didn't. That failure aside, many of their dessert dishes were pretty good, like the creme brulee and fruit tart. Their crepe was a bummer. The batter was tasteless and the berries were sour. The candied nuts they use are not fresh and have that refrigerated taste. All the meat dishes I tried were delicious. The prime rib was cooked just right and the pork apple dish was yummy, much better than the dry chewy crap at The Bacchanal. Their hot cherries were good. I think it's hilarious how they have sushi.. . Service was average as far as buffets go. Our server came to our table so infrequently that we had to place our finished dishes on a nearby table. . . Overall, I enjoyed the food and would probably go again. Lots of quality desserts and meats to choose from is always a bonus for me.
Wow. I can definitely saw i was impressed with the breakfast here .. Their cheese , hame, egg quiche was very fresh and tasty. . . The biscuits and sausage gravy was sol delicious i actually had seconds.. They have over 5-6 different egg selections pre made.. If u don't want them pre made u can make your own omelette and the omelette station.... Or u can just have plain eggs, sunny side up, scramble, etc. the carving station has ham and thick bacon . . Fresh fruit and lots of sweets!!! The ice cream was a vanilla custard a chocolate custard... It was similar to frozen yogurt but it tastes so rich and creamy.  . . Overalll i highly recommend it too everyone to try!!!
Our Server "Isela" was great. Food is good and tasty. Enjoyed the desserts. My wife and I enjoyed our dinner. Got a heavy and full belly on the way out.
I've eaten here for breakfast and for dinner, months apart. The food and service would get three stars.... . ...but both times I've eaten here I've suffered an attack of TMI so violent that I was FORCED TO DROP TROU SOMEWHERE THAT WAS NOT A BATHROOM. The omelet station guy was great and the service was friendly, but it doesn't make up for having to crap on a pedestrian overpass and wipe my ass with some homeless guy's discarded sweatshirt. I'm lucky to not have ass herpes or a citation for indecent exposure.. . Sure, the first time I could blame bad luck, but a second time, months later? Someone needs to upgrade their standards for food prep. Meanwhile, I'll stick to rolling the dice somewhere that "craps" is not a literal consequence.
Service was on point. The food appears to be pretty consistent as this is my third time having lunch here. The lunch and dinnermenu seem very similar.  My favorite part are the desserts. I absolutely love the fruit tarts and often find myself grabbing a bunch ( for peace of mind) lol.
This is a great buffet. I have tried this buffet for breakfast and dinner on two separate occasions and they were both great.. . This buffet is on the 24 hour unlimited buffets of buffets list. By far, this is my favorite. . . Dont be discouraged by the long line. The wait is usually 20-30 minutes. . . The food is tasty and delicious. The Italian/French cuisine will make you want more and more but guess what? You can have more and more... lol.. . The dessert selection is big and most of them are great. . . Overall, I highly recommend this buffets.
Awful buffet!  Food wasn't delicious and there wasn't a croissant in sight. Total bummer.
Yummy!! We hit Paris to start our buffet of buffets about 3 pm on a Friday.  The off time allowed us to walk right in. . . What a treat! The crepe making station was SO good!! I had 2 and couldn't eat another bite or I would have had more! They have an awesome selection for non meat eaters such as myself.  Great pastas, soups, cheeses, bread and did I mention crepes?! The Mac and cheese with truffles and peas was to die for and so were the scalloped potatoes.   . . Husband who eats meat wasn't as impressed, but really he can eat at any buffet and be happy.  He also didn't have Nutella crepes!   . . The service was really great, friendly waitress and quick drink refills.  You can't go wrong here!
We went there for the weekend brunch and it ended up being about $35/pp after waiting about 25 minutes to be seated. It also came with unlimited alcohol and we were not expecting much since buffet service always seemed to be lacking especially when refilling alcohol. However we were pleasantly surprised that the waitresses kept returning to us to refill drinks and clear up plates, even though we were in one of the smaller side rooms. She even left us a canter of mimosa. . The food on the other hand was just OK. The highly anticipated crepes was the biggest downside after waiting 20 minutes in line to order. The crepe was just too thick (it was more of a lighter pancake) and the filling tasted old due to being left out too long. The best dish was the clam which had a fradiavolo type sauce with it. They also had crab legs which were halved, so you don't have to crack it. The highlight of the meal was probably the creme brulee which I had to sadly force down ( I was disgustingly full, probably after drinking close to a pitcher of mimosa because I certainly don't remember eating much of the food). . Tip: Decent brunch buffet, don't wait on the crepe line. I would suggest to try the crepe place across, I heard better reviews from others while waiting at the crepe station.
Awful experience, the food option is terrible. I should of gone with the reviews, but I still wanted to give it a chance anyways. I would NOT recommend anyone to try this place. Lack of service, food options, & quality of food.
Big problems with proper food handling and customer control, )kids touching food using and returning plates to stacks, etc.)  I almost guarantee you'll get sick to your stomach if eating here.  Its a shame since the concept is so nice.  This is one you'd think the health department would key into
My friend and I tried the breakfast as part of our "Buffet of Buffets" pass.  The food was outstanding!  Fresh breads, crispy bacon, and the crepes were delicious.  Our waitress was very courteous and attentive.  My friend and I had such a good experience that we decided to come back for dinner.  Our dinner experience was wonderful as well.  They had a wide variety of dishes ranging from seafood (crab legs, salmon, mussels) to sausages, pasta dishes, duck, and prime rib.  "Le Village" strives to be a top-notch French restaurant, so you won't find standard American fare here (fried chicken, ribs, large salad bar, etc.).  But if you're in the mood for a meal with a European flare and excellent service, I highly recommend this place.
I love love love this Buffet.  I love French food to begin with.  An added pleasure is that they have a wonderful creperie in the buffet which can make custom crepes for you.  Love it love it love it.  I hate the lines though- especially during the weekends.  But the lines are proof in itself that the food here is delicious.  Bring your total rewards card when you check in here so you get the points.
Make a reservation through 'Open Table' a day in advance. Gotta hit a buffet when your in Las Vegas, right? This wasn't a crazy luxurious buffet but it was decent. We went for lunch. Didn't wait long at all.. . All the buffet standerds and French dishes too. Plenty of food choices but not overwhelming. Crepe station was yummy. The pastries were good. Definitely got our money's worth.
