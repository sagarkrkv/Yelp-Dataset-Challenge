We've love this hotel in the past, and stayed many many times. Unfortunately her recent stay, hello wonderful, the hotel under MGM management continued to place charges I'm our American Express card. Apparently they are more concerned with covering losses from customers who attempt to take advantage, and charge good customers outrageous fees, forcing them to never return.
Fun place to hang out . Great drinks either at the bar or served at the machines.Just like the atmosphere.Always clean not Smoky and classy.Stayed here on a weekend date.Very nice rooms.My choice as the Best of Vegas.
Just checked into Bellagio in one of the new towers. We booked the deluxe luxury rooms. The rooms are new and we'll done but the hospitality leaves a lot to be desired. They sold us a parking lot view room in the name of fountain view room. Rooms were not ready for checkin even at 2 pm and they have removed even the electric tea cattle from the room. We called services to provide one and she said it would be additional $31 just for the hot water kettle!!! We tried to order in room food and she said the wait time was more than  1 hr in a tone that begged us to not place an order.... We have just arrived so I will update the thread over the next couple of days...
It's been a few years, and when I went, Bellagio was THEE place to stay in Vegas. . . I had the fortune of a friend treating me to the stay while we were in town for the WSOP. From the moment we walked in, it was clear that this was a masterpiece of Las Vegas. The feel, the atmosphere, everything was first class. The hand blown glass tulips in the lobby are breathtaking. There is an air of classiness to this place that seems lacking in other casinos (not all of them) on the strip. Bellagio feels like it runs at a slower, more deliberate pace. The staff were first class and very professional. . . The room itself made you want to stay and appreciate it. Everything from the fully stocked wet bar, to the view, to the absolutely gorgeous bathroom with steam shower and hot tub, to the most comfortable beds just made the Bellagio steal the show. The view of the strip is awesome. There is so much to do in the hotel/casino that you could really just stay there; lots of high end shops, restaurants, salon & day spa, etc. can fill your day with activities.. . Fortunately, I had been to Vegas twice prior to staying here so I could justify just hanging out and taking in as much as I could. Everything about the Bellagio is just dripping with elegance. I know that now, it is considered one of the "older" hotels on the strip, but that does not make it any less appealing. At night time, it is always an experience to go take in one of the fountain shows. . . Yeah, it's pricey, but it's doable if you're visiting off-season and work your magic on the internet to book a room with them. The room service is flawless. . . On the casino floor, they are very aggressive to make sure you have drinks while you are gaming and even if you are not. I came down the elevators early one morning around 5:45am to grab a newspaper and a coffee. A very attractive young waitress approached me as I walked out of and asked me if she could get me a drink. I told her I was just looking for some coffee and a newspaper. She told me she would go get me one and asked me if I would like Bailey's with it, to which I happily accepted. I wandered over and grabbed a newspaper, and she was waiting for me with not one, but two cups of coffee with lids on them.. . Bellagio will always hold a special place in my heart. Great memories and I hope to be back one day. Without hesitation, 5 stars.
I love the garden and flowers in this hotel.  They are just beautiful!  Every time I come to Las Vegas, I am always excited to see the floral display.  This time, I took my children to see the flowers and they were both amazed with how beautiful it looked.
My bf and I had a drink with Dorothy, she was awesome. She definitely goes above and beyond for her customers. Very pleasant experience.
Great hotel in great location. Could not have been a better experience. Rooms very spacious and casino clean and easy to navigate. Not always the case when in Vegas. Check in was easy. Dined at  Yellowtail  restaurant which was expensive but worth it. Would like to comment our waiter Roberto who was off the charts great. My 84 year old uncle requires a scooter and can require more attention than a regular patron. and Roberto made our dining experience a memorable one and he should be complimented for this. He is truly an asset to the Bellagio. Would definitely stay here again.
Still my most favorite casino in Vegas.  I didn't stay there on this particular trip but have stayed twice in the past.  The rooms are ok but the casino is especially nice.  It's not the seedy, nasty kind of casino but a place that you can hang out in all day and feel very comfortable.
I will try to be as fair about this review as I can be. . . The good points. This hotel is certainly impressive, and the accommodations are top notch. It is certainly in keeping with the root Italian word of this Hotel's sobriquet, which is Bella! Something extraordinarily beautiful that it is unforgettable. You sigh at beholding such beauty.. . However, my sigh comes from the extravagant price of the suite that did not quite deliver on our expectations.. . We arrived at a very busy holiday weekend, and the only room available was a Private Suite at $600 / night. I politely asked what type of amenities came with this room, and I was provided with a well written brochure outlining the impressive size and view of this quite expensive room. Needless to say, we were impressed and handed the lady my American Express Card.. . As we were escorted upstairs, we had very high expectations as to what this room would be. We have stayed in many suites in many hotels in Las Vegas, and we were informed that this was going to be better than any of them.. . When the door swung open, we were greeted with what amounted to a nice comfortable suite whose description did not align itself with what we saw, and summarily experienced. The suite was smaller than what we expected, and it's layout actually was not as functional. There were too many hidden corners. Instead of a nice expansive view, we had a room that was like a maze. . . Honestly, in all the times that I have stayed in LV, this was the most disappointing experience I have ever had seeing as that I was paying alot for this room.. . Needless to say, I will not be staying in another Bellagio Suite ever again. Not for even half what they charged us for this Suite. There are much better hotels in LV than this for 1/3 the price. (See my other review of another LV Hotel Suite).
Still a first rate resort casino! And I'd probably give it 5 stars if I hadn't stayed here so many times before. But this time was just not up to Bellagio standards. Everything is impressive but room was a bit worn, crowds were a bit "casual", service was just great. Hopefully is was just an off weekend and it wont keep me from going back!
I've been to the Bellagio a few times and it's always fun.  Located at a great spot on the strip.  Seems to be the epicenter of great spots; restaurants, shopping, etc.  The fountains out front are gorgeous and if you are unhappy with your room they will move you somewhere you like.. . My friends always get a room with a fountain view.  They usually have a drink and watch the fountains before heading out for the night.  One other thing we usually do is reserve chase lounges at the Cypress pool.  It's not cheap, $75/day, but it's worth it.  Great service and staff, and no jockeying for chairs.. If you're a gambler the casino is supposed to have the best odds in Vegas.  I don't know about that but the dealers are friendly.  I'm not much of a gambler so you'll have to see for yourself.. If you've never stayed here I encourage you to give it a shot.  If you don't like the smell of flowers when you enter, the 2 story chocolate fountain might get you.  Whatever your flavor, The Bellagio, while not cheap, is worth the visit.
What a gorgeous place! We arrived at 6:30 am. The people at the counter were very helpful and tried to help us check in early but our room wasn't ready. They gave us our room key and let us know they would call us when it was ready. When we finally got our room it had a great view of the pool, highway, etc pretty cool 17th story view. The bathroom was big! The ambiance is wonderful and it is not crowded. Lots of beautiful decor and this place is very clean.
Just returned from my 1st trip to Vegas. We wanted class so we stayed at the Bellagio. I flew in from CA and arrived at noon.  My friend was coming from the north and her flight was delayed 8 hours.  Because Expedia did not have my name on the itinerary, Bellagio was not going to let me check in.  They finally relented when I pulled out an email addressed to me by my friend (who booked the room) with the reservation attached.  Customer service?   Terrible.  . In addition, the hotel is dated, dumpy and has the worst wall art ever.  . We had 2 free buffet visits listed on the Expedia itinerary/reservation.  At check out, we had to pay additional fees ($13) as they said the 'free' visits were only worth $60. Nowhere on any of our documents did it list the cost of the buffet as %60 or as anything else.  Cheap, cheap, cheap trick.  The food at the buffet sounded grand but was mediocre at best. Cheap cuts of meat and pre-frozen, thawed shrimp. . We had breakfast at Cafe Bellagio and paid cash. It was $60 for 2 for a Denny's quality meal.  However, at checkout, we were also charged $18.99 for breakfast.  No explanation was given. . I have stayed at 5 star hotels all over the world and I cannot understand why the Bellagio is viewed as opulent. I would never stay there again and would never recommend it.
Came here for Cam's work event and it started off pretty rocky. We asked for an early check in - supposed to be at 9am and we didn't get our room until way after 10am. I wouldn't be so upset about it but we caught the red eye the night before and of course we had Logan (1.5yrs old) who was not loving the time difference and lack of space to lay out. When we got to our room we asked for the mini fridge to be locked because once again, we have a 1.5 yr old FULL of mischief and they didn't lock it the entire time. Even after we brought it up to the bellhop, the lady at check in and one of the house keeping ladies. THEN we didn't know this til I almost died, but our toilet was leaking. I found out the hard way! We were gone most of the day and I came back alone with Logan and attempted to grab his tooth brush there goes my foot slipping on the pool of water near the toilet. Gross I know, but I ended up slipping and luckily I grabbed the counter before I slipped back. The distance between the shower and the sink is super close too! We called it and the guy came up pretty fast to fix it. . The maid service is very punctual and there were a few times I wasn't even able to stop her from barging in. She'd knock and say house keeping and just walk right in lol. . I loved our room since it was right off the elevator and there was no smoking in the area we were in. It was kind of nice not walking back to your room smelling like cigarette smoke.. We also had a nice sundries shop right downstairs and were able to get Logan's milk from there too. . Over all, beautiful hotel.
The Bellagio is one of the nicest hotels in Las Vegas. It is an elegant structure that is beautiful inside and out.. . My favorite place to dine inside the Bellagio is Yellowtail. It is located near the valet on Flamingo Rd. There are other amazing dining opportunities all throughout the hotel. There is also a great bakery over by the shopping area where all the flowers are.. . The rooms and suites are amazing. They have great views of the Westside of the Valley and of the Strip. The food from room service is better than many of the restaurants that I have eaten at on the Strip.. . They have an amazing fountain and light show at night that you can view from the strip or from any of the surrounding area.. . The casino itself if very large and they have a very nice high limit room with a very comfortable high limit lounge. There are also a couple of nightlife Venus to choose from.. . I really like the fact that you can actually walk out the back of the hotel over to City Center (Vadra).. . I highly recommend frequenting the Bellagio.
if you're not a hardcore gambling/clubbing/drinking type like me and have some extra cash to spare, opt for the room with a fountain view. if it's your first time in Vegas or you haven't been in a while, it's a great introduction to the strip and just nicer in general.. . the hotel staff was so accommodating, and they gave my uncle's room and my parent's room free upgrades to better rooms. the rooms are clean, quiet, and the view was beautiful both on the fountain view room and the regular, pool-view room.. . front desk keita was great :)
Another great stay here. You get what you pay for. Beautiful place, outstanding service, great restaurants. . Rene is my favorite. Beverage server who is very nice and does a great job with a smile.
This is a classic hotel. It just never gets old. I love this place I have stayed here like three times and I love it. The rooms are very clean and nice.
Really like the location.. . Our room was well appointed, comfortable, great tub and shower booth.. the room isn't too big but enough for 2 adult.
I arrived in the morning and had hoped to get an early check in and the clerk at registration was very helpful but as a result of checking in early I was not able to get a lake view room as I had requested since those rooms were not ready yet. This was fine since I wanted to get into a room now instead of later, plus I had assumed all rooms would be nice at the Bellagio. My room accommodations were pleasant. The king bed was very comfortable and I slept soundly. Turndown service did not impress me because I expected more from the Bellagio.  My room 4118 had a very nice view of the pool area. It was quiet, roomy and tastefully decorated.. . The room is equipped with a fully stocked minibar with snacks.  Bottled water starts at $5.00 for Dasani and goes up from there. The minibar is also electronically weighted so if you lift a bottle out of the bar it will automatically be charged to your room so beware. I purchased one bottle of water and then I thought I would use the empty slot to refrigerate a sandwich I had brought back to my room.  When I decided to eat my sandwich later in the day, I found out that I was charged again for another water. I informed the front desk and they removed the charge and in addition for the inconvenience they comped me the other bottle as well. That was a nice touch.. . The hotel is very large and the hallways between elevators and some rooms can be quite far.  I would recommend for those that have mobility issues to make sure to request a room close to the elevators otherwise get ready for a long walk.. . The hotel has plenty of good restaurants and of course you need to check out the fountains and beautiful atrium.  In addition, if you like fine art you can visit their onsite art gallery for an additional fee.  I did not do that this time because I wasn't interested with their current exhibition but may be next time.
If you want more of an upscale feel of a casino then look no further! Make sure you bring plenty cash because the winnings over here are a lot less likely. I mean it's vegas and once you find your favorite place to gamble stick to it. It's one of those to each is own kind of situations but I rather not gamble here. Never had much luck but have friends who have!
I once rated this a 5 star but I must say during our stay we did not feel the benefits of a 5 star resort. Checkout  lines were ridiculously long and understaffed. I love that this place is clean and that they take pride in keeping this place beautiful but I feel like that is all there is......cleaning cleaning cleaning, at odd hours when people are in the casino. Common areas seemed to be cleaned during hours where lots of people are walking by. I think there was more cleaning than there were cocktail waitresses. This place is more of a looker than anything.
I would give the hotel itself 4 stars, as it's obviously nice but there are a lot of things that they could do better when it comes to customer service:. . 1. Have a line so that check-in/out isn't random.  They don't have one line so that if you're next you go to the next available person.  It's like a grocery line and how quick it happens depends on what is happening with the guest in that line so if you happen to choose the wrong line with the guest that wants to chat about his gun collection with the front desk clerk, you're there for 15 minutes while others who came after are done.  I know my luck!. . 2.  I was there when there was a power outage this past week.  I understand those things are beyond your control but all I know is that the lights in my room go out at around 9pm on Monday and you would think there would be some sort of announcement or something that tells you what is happening.  You can't even get someone on the phone to see if it's just your room, your floor or the whole hotel.  Couldn't  tell if it's just your room since the hallway lights were working.  The water show is happening since you can see it out your window.. . 3.  Morning after the power outage - no hot water for showers.  Coldest shower that I've ever taken but really can you go without a shower in July in Vegas?. . And no comments from management, type of small credit or anything for the inconvenience of 2 and 3.  . . Damn, give me a friggin snack bar item just to show that you realize that it was a pain in the a**.
Wow.  I'm literally standing in the check in line as I write this review and it is an ASTOUNDIMG mess. I've had better service at Taco Bell. I've been waiting in line for almost half an hour now.  Hopefully the rest of this stay is much.much.better.
The staff is great and the rooms are nice. We had plumbing issues with the sink and shower which is disappointing for the amount we paid. Love the restaurants here and the pool is great for a chill time or families. The servers at the pool are not so good. There was 8 of us females and not once did they come up to us. These ladies could have made a ton of money if they had actually asked. All in all...an average stay!
Bellagio never disappoints. My room is freshly remodeled. Great view. Second time staying here. One of my favorite Vegas places to be.
Just returned from a fabulous anniversary trip to Las Vegas. We booked a fountain view room at the Bellagio and we were not disappointed, the lady at check in asked if we had a preference for floor and we told her to give us the best in her opinion, so we were placed on the 28th floor. The elevators are a thrill ride, LOL ZOOOOM! We walked in the room and WOW! The Eiffel tower at the Paris and the entire fountain area like a postcard!.  Best room I have every had in Vegas. Comfy bed and pillows, very clean and fully stocked (but pricey) mini bar. LOL, But vending and ice was just up the hall. . Casino was fun. better class of folks for the most part, but still a party atmosphere. Actually didnt do too bad and came home with winnings! . WE do tip well, so we had some really good bell & valet service. Really not sure why anyone would complain, unless nothing pleases them. It was one of the best experiences I have had traveling, and the place is JUST GORGEOUS!! The flowers alone are worth the visit! . The resort is not for folks who want to get stupid and loud, head to hard Rock if thats your thing. It does have that high end elegance that many casinos and hotels are missing in town.. Also if you LOVE high end shopping ( even if its just the window variety) you can spend a day inside and around the resort. its located in a fun spot on the strip. The money they didnt get at slots I spent at Giardini for beautiful Italian ceramics! Better than a cheap T-shirt, LOL.. Then there is Jean Phillipes Patisserie, with the giant chocolate fountain. Not just decadent sweets, but great Panini and crepes for lunch, and we made it our go to for coffee and Brioche for breakfast. Grab something and go sit by the pool with the paper ( Only for guests) .. Awesome dinner on your checklist? We chose Le Cirque at the Bellagio.  If French food is your thing,and you like to dress to impress, its one of the best. The service was amazing, the decor & the plates were wonderful and the food Gourmet. They helped me arrange a surprise for our anniversary and presented the table with a Beautiful cake from Jean Phillipes in our anniversary colors! 5 star+ to their whole team!!. I cant wait to return again!!!
If I could give this Casino a 0 I would. The corporate staff and security are very disrespectful.. There was an issue that happened at one of the nightclubs about two weeks ago, I am now 86ed from the property and was told by Security that I just have to contact Ray Brown to get the 86 lifted.. Prior to being 86th they lied to me to get me into the security office in order to 86 me.. I have now contacted Security and left 4 messages  four times saying I will get a call back and never have.. The lady that answered the phone who I've spoke to each time said her name was Kris but I do not know if that is even true.. She is very disrespectful, interrupts you, I caught her in a lie which is pretty funny, and also has hung up on me numerous times..
Disappointing from beginning to end. First time stay here-and last. Waited 50 minutes in line to check in behind annoying family with big demands. Watched at least 20 others check in around me while the "supervisors" stood behind the check in counters and enjoyed each other's company, laughing and ignoring the rest of us. The room was nothing special. Uncomfortable beds, very small -and horrible "free" wifi. Gave up on the weak signal. The casino, pool, cafes and walkways are overcrowded and frustrating. Couldn't wait to leave and find a casino where we could play and receive decent service. I usually stay at the Aria- and desperately wish I had chosen to stay there this time. Will never stay at the Bellagio again and will tell everyone I know to avoid it as well.
Don't leave anything in the hotel room, they'll just take it... The service is also rude.
Beautiful reception lobby.  I love the glass pieces on the ceiling.  Whenever I'm in vegas I always check out what they have on display in their atrium.  They got one of the best buffets in Vegas.  I'm always making sure I eat here once every time I visit Vegas.
Recommend this to anyone, you have to see this place.  It has a dancing water fountain display, botanical garden, awesome buffet, shopping mall, dance clubs, restaurants to chose from and many more.
Had never been here a was pretty stoked to get my chance. I had heard amazing things and definitely did not disappoint. . . The bellagio is the nicest and most expensive hotel I have stayed at in Vegas. The Friday they Sunday cost me $800 but with the resort fees and etc it was over $1100. A little pricey for a weekend in July but I knew it was 5 stars and my gf is worth it. . . The rooms are immaculate and the sheets, pillows and beds are plush. The eoom was cleaned very day perfectly and the staff was nice. The check in did take a few more than I am used to but it was Friday afternoon so it was busy. . . I would definitely stay here agin but maybe have to look for a special rate. We did not gamble here as the tables were very high minimums.
I have nothing to say but good about this place, the water show is cool especially for the kids. The rooms are nice and comfortable just like the staff. I did have a Problem getting a room key , after I had left my I.d in the room, but after giving them the proper information everything was cool and I was back at the casino and understood their safety concerns. Anyway if your gonna gamble here expect to spend some cash, there's no 5 black jack here.
We checked in to the Bellagio on 6/25/14.. Were told that they had a small refrigerator for my husband's insulin that could be brought to our room free of charge!. Fantastic!. The next morning when he went to take it out IT WAS FROZEN SOLID!. Many hours later of forms; risk management people; promises that the over $530 in insulin would be refunded we are now OVER A MONTH LATER and it is still a run around!. .     Stayed June 2014
The fountain show is a MUST! Absolutely awesome! Hotel is over the top.
