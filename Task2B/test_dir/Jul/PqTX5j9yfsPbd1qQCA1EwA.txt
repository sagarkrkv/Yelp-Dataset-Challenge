Super fun nightclub free drinks for an hour , dj played old school r&b and rap which was cool. Had an awesome time with friends would definitely come back to this place next time I'm in vagueassss ... Peace!
I wish I could give them negative stars!  . The front desk person told me that if we went to their restaurant and ordered food we would get a pass to their nightclub.  We went and ate their mediocre food and ordered their expensive drinks, and at the end they told us that we had not consumed enough!  Keep in mind that we stayed in the Venetian which is one of their properties, and we ordered a full dish for her, for me, and full drinks for both of us.  I would have tried to get in and pay whatever they ask, but while I was there I noticed that the people who go there are not really that good looking, in fact they tend to be the people that you would not invite to any kind of party.  If you are considering Tao, do yourself a favor and go to Surrender instead, much better place!
I have been to XS. ..Vanity....Rehab...Palms....and recieved bottle service...AND then there's TAO. It was the worst bottle service I have ever received. Our area was for 3 to 5 people per table...One table had 12 people...and the other table was so drunk one of the girls dropped her drink all over the seat in our area and didn't say anything and I sat in it.Disgusting. No one came to clean up it till almost close even when I had asked 3 hours earlier. Then Tao advertised for Dj Khaled to be there that night @ 10 pm and he didn't show up it 1 am. Don't pay for bottle service in my opinion ...it's hot and their customer service sucks unless your a celebrity.
I usually hate it when people say they wish they could give 0 stars - obviously I have just never have an experience that warranted it until now! My experience reads just like so many other negative reviews of Tao.. . I ate at the restaurant and the food was fine but not fantastic. The price of the food however was what you would pay for amazing food. I had no problem with that however until I experienced the night club. I guess since they are considered one of the strip's top clubs (which is totally undeserved) they feel like they can have terrible attitudes. Maybe they even think being rude adds to their desirability. Whatever the reason the staff didn't know how to treat anyone and the club was so crowded we could barely move much less actually dance. . . Still I didn't have a huge problem until a large guard got overly aggressive with me. This man was literally about 4 times my size and got in my face when I called him out for being rude and speaking to people like they were dogs. When he got in my personal space and I still refused to back down he called over the real cops like a whiny little punk. The real cops agreed with me that the guards at Tao are on a power trip and this is the only way they have to feel good about themselves.. . What's worse is that the security guard manager did absolutely nothing about it. I have been to Vegas many times and have never had a negative experience before this. Needless to say I will never go back to this establishment.
I come to Vegas every year and this year decided to come to Tao. I had a great time Dj Khalid was there and got the club hype! It was very packed, however you can't come to a club in Vegas and expect it to not be packed. The atmosphere was great and so was the music. Dj Khalid rocked the house.I want to get a table next time for a different experience... Especially due to the moron that kept dancing behind us and shaking his fist over our heads and hitting my head a few times to where I had to turn around and let him know I don't play that game. I do however definitely recommend coming here it was very fun and an overall good experience.
Came here with my girl crew during the 4th of July holiday on Saturday night after having dinner downstairs. Place was packed. Was playing ratchet and trap music. Good stuff to get turnt to. Everyone was pulling down their train handles (the turn up dance) Apparently DJ khaled was on the 1's and 2's, but just for like an hour or less, and then someone whack hoped on after him, and then the music got better again when Floyd Maywheather arrived. As good as the music was, it was impossible to dance, because everyone was densely crowding in the main dancefloor area between the DJ booth and the VIP where Floyd was, then apparently Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka came through too. (Sidenote, KD is super sweet, chill and humble, just wants to have fun like the rest of us, and with the rest of us) The thirst was overbearing, and surprisingly mostly from guys. Guys were so hype to crowd those celebs, it was a sausage fest, me and my ladies just gave up trying to dance and stayed over in the corner by the bar till leaving. Could have been a good time, hope they control their guy to girl ratio next time.
I have very NEGATIVE feelings about Tao - I have never in my life felt more disgusted about any establishment. I had to deal with borderline harassment from their security and bad service. There are so many better options to choose from in Vegas, and Tao should really be your last and let me reiterate LAST option. I believe the current yelp ratings comparatively to other clubs speak for themselves if you have to ask me. . . The first time I came to Tao it was for Hardwell on a Thursday night, theweekend before NYE 2012. Earlier that evening my friends and I arrived early for the ladies open bar happy hour. I ordered a drink and one of my guy friends took one small sip from it. Seconds later, two of the security men stormed up to me, grabbed me, and took me into a small room by the back wall without any explanation. . . My friends were screaming and banging on the door asking for them to release me as they were very worried. One of the security guards very rudely explained that because it was a ladies open bar, I was not allowed to have my guy friend take a sip from my drink. . . Ok - but lets be real here - if that were the case did it really require them to take me to a secluded room away from the public and put me in harms way? They could have just told me in the presence of others, as it is not a big issue. I am glad that they released me after explaining, but really, none of that was necessary. That experience left a bitter taste, as it was unnecessary trauma. . . My second experience was more recent. I was at Tao for a joint bachelor/bachelorette party two weekends ago for Fabulous. Because the couple decided to do a package deal, we had dinner earlier at the Tao Bistro for 15 people. As part of the package, there was dinner and bottle service provided for the group. As soon as we got to the club, we were given a table outside of the main room which was not ideal but that was ok. . . FYI, the food at Tao Bistro is really just mediocre Asian fusion food and not worth the money. . . Now onto the incompetent service. The group was kept waiting for almost 2 hours for the table service because the hostess could not match the package deal to the credit card on file without having the actual credit card that made the purchase. The entire dinner/club packaged was already paid for and yet there was a problem? Because of the wait, our group just cancelled the table service. That kind of service is unacceptable. At the very least, because of the incompetence, our dinner was reduced in price. . . Most people in the group were only in Vegas for one night, specifically to be at Tao, and Tao ruined this experience especially for the future bride and groom. Honestly I thought my second experience would be better. . . Ironically, for a club Tao is a buzzkill. . . Tao, see you never!
This is a 5 star, not 3. People are inpatient and lame. Everything is bomb! Lobster won tons were...bomb! Udon was...bomb! Tempura sweet potato was...bomb!!!!
Went to the Khloe Kardashin night at TAO. Absolutely disappointed. They over sold the event. No room to walk, talk or dance. It was ridiculous over crowded. Sorry I paid to go & never will do that again
Had the worst experience here and ruined our first night of clubbing in Vegas. I always plan these things weeks in advance to ensure peace of mind. I was promised by management that all the couples in our group would be comped. Once we got there the people at the door made up some BS and said guys have to pay $40 and "all the girls" will be comped, but supposedly the open bar until midnight for girls lets you take "2 drinks at a time with the wristbands". Then they handed me a paper which I didn't look over but was supposed to present to the cashier. Once getting to cashier I was then told only 3/5 of the girls will get comped and the other two are also $40. Are you EFFING KIDDING ME? At this point I texted Justin pleading "what's going on, this is not what you promised?"... He completely abandoned me replying "things changed, sorry". What type of guest service is that?!! Then once we finally got in, the bartenders at the "open bar" barely acknowledged girls with wristbands so we really had to fight for their attention, and come to find it was not "2drinks with wristband" but 1! 1 FRIGGIN' drink, which was more like just a glass of ice. Like really Tao? This is what you've resorted to? No wonder everyone says "Tao sucks now" and your establishment is not known to be a credible one. Not to mention the restrooms  have no privacy. Never again will we be going there, made sure to tell everyone I know in LA about this horrendous experience and most people agreed (no surprise there).. . On a happier note_ we went to Marquee next day, all couples comped, and had a blast. The promoter there kept his word, unlike the devious pigs at Tao.
I can see why this place only gets 3 stars now. My friends and I were on the guest list so it didn't take too long to get in on Saturday night. My boyfriend was able to get in free as well. It was fun for maybe 10 minutes because once we stepped in, the atmosphere seemed great. The decor was pretty cool!. . However, the dance floor was JAM packed. I watched as my sister got tossed around in multiple directions because people kept pushing around to get across. It definitely felt like a workout just trying to stay standing on my feet. Gah.. . Again, it was only fun for maybe 10 minutes. Way too crowded for my liking.
This was my first time clubbing and I expected it to be crowded but not crazy crowded like how Tao was. The wait to get into the club wasn't too bad since my friends and I were on the guest list. When I walked inside, the interior was really nice. . . It was fun for about 10-15 minutes and then it stops. Why? Because it gets overcrowded and theres a ton of people pushing and shoving to get by. People were nice about it when they are trying to get through but it was getting a bit too ridiculous. I was literally getting shoved and knocked all over the place. I wasn't able to even stand in place for a good 5 minutes before I got pushed around AGAIN. . . Other than the pushing and shoving, it was quite an interesting experience clubbing in Vegas.
This is seriously one of my favorite nightclubs! But here are the deets.... . PROS: . - AMAZING decor for the club. Absolutely love the zen vibe along with the giant red chandeliers. . - There are two dance floors with two different DJ's spinning different types of music. . - One dance floor is a smaller one with a more intimate vibe (located on the left side once you've made it to the top of the stairs). - The main dance floor is huge and surrounded by trendy looking VIP tables. - The DJ's are always spinning incredible music, making it impossible not to dance all night long. . - Love the confetti and soap bubbles they blow out over the dance floor about every 30 minutes, makes it fun and exciting. . - They have a nice balcony to go out on for some fresh air while you overlook the strip. . - Sometimes Disco Dave is there (a human dancing disco ball). - The lady dancers are good at keeping the crowd pumped up. . . CONS:. - Super crowded nightclub because it's so popular. . - Sometimes it's tough to get in, even if you're on a VIP guest list. - The bouncers aren't particularly friendly. . . The stellar music, outrageous atmosphere, and extraordinary decor all keep me coming back for more. Definitely one of the best clubs in Vegas!
My friends and I came in a group of 5. I contacted a promoter beforehand and he was able to get all 5 of us in for free, even though we had a guy with us. It was open bar for ladies until 11:30pm, though drinks are quite limited. However, the bartenders do put a ton of alcohol, since they are so busy, so if you're looking to get drunk off of these drinks, it is entirely possible. We arrived close to 11pm. There were lots of people trying to get in but thanks to our promoter, we waited no more than 5 minutes. . . It was cool that there were multiple floors. I wish they had some free areas for people to sit for a few minutes. My heels were killing me! The decor was gorgeous. However, it was much too crowded in there. It was fun for the first 10-15 minutes until the dance floor became overly packed. Also, it was dark in there so it was hard to see which areas were roped off for reservations. People were nice generally. I didn't see anyone barfing anywhere and if people were trying to get through, they almost always apologized and excused themselves. I wish they had a bigger dance floor. Would've made the experience so much better!
The decor on this place is cool, the DJ played great music . My girl got to drink for free (yay for my pockets), its a pretty mixed cool crowd. this place is jumping..with that being said its way to overcrowded we found a spot and pretty much stayed in that one spot..not by choice but if we moved then we were going to knock somebody over
Every time I come to Vegas, I visit Tao and am never disappointed.. . This time my husband and I were celebrating my birthday and got bottle service in the hip hop room.. We had a great time!. . Why 4 stars.... When we arrived it took almost 20 min for the cocktail waitress to get our bottle of Hen and our mixers.. One of the drunk ass guys at the table next to us almost knocked down our bottle of Hen and did knock down one of our mixers all over the floor. Lucky for him not on my shoes!!!. And the rope that was supposed to protect us and our alcohol... kept getting knocked down, people were trying to hop over, and there was no security in sight.
Cheesy.  I'm over having foam, confetti and light sticks thrown on me (I was over that during 8th grade bar mitzvahs).  Especially when it is on a overcrowded dance floor with nasty people making out all around you and grabby guys.  We stayed at the Palazzo so we got a free pass with our hotel room which also got us a few drinks.  Even with that, this place was lame.. The DJ was good--not playing music I really liked (some top 40 but mostly edm) and it was just too crowded across the whole club.
I've been there once it was ok i didn't like the behavior of the bouncers there but other then that everything was fine
Gone majorly downhill. Staff is rude, music sucks, roof is hardly ever open. Use to be so good.
Very crowded (you couldn't really dance or get around) . Music sucked it would have slight pauses and weird mixture of music.. Drinks where watered down.. Saw a lot of people having issues getting out of there ( too drunk to go down the stairs). Oh and it was super hot in there!! . It was nasty.
Horrible! Don't waist your time honestly. Starting with security! They are racist, they don't care about the customers at all. They definitely do not care about the reputation of the club. They rather have people walk away than stay the night. The most ridiculous thing I ever heard, they were telling groups of guys that in order to get in they need to get bottle service. I'm sure money is not an issue for these guys but why would they get bottle service before entering the club? what if they don't even like it? . . There may be people whom do not get on the guest list but for a business like this, not being on the guest list is much profitable and they still treat you awful. I wonder what the owner might think about the way the customers get treated here. I think its much profitable to bring in people that are willing to pay for their ticket and drinks. Tons of chick groups getting in already waited while waiting in line...This is ridiculous seriously, I got pushed and my drinks spilled by drunk girls. I suggest they change the guards and get people whom have better judgment on whom they let in. Someone honest and fair!!!. . The place inside was okay although It can be organized much better in terms of the crowding. The drinks were also low quality and sometimes not made well and the bartenders are fairly rude depending on how busy they are.
