Fantastic brunch
Had the FEZ salad. Best salad I've ever eaten in my life. Only giving this place a four because the host/waiter pushed me into sitting at the bar, when I really wanted a table.
We had been here for happy hour and had a great time.  The bartenders took great care of us.  The appetizers on the happy hour menu were really tasty.  The Friday night drink special was very good .. . I like the ambiance of the restaurant.  A little modern, a little funky.  The staff is very friendly.  . . One thing to note.  If describe something as garlicky.  They mean it.  . . I will come back, when I'm over on this side of town.  It's a perfect stop before seeing a show at the Rythm Room.
Went to Fez for brunch a week ago and had a great meal. All employees were fantastic and friendly. Definitely will go back.
Spent my 10th year anniversary here with my wife.  The atmosphere is amazing, service is great and the food is worth traveling from Texas for.
A great place to go to unwind with good friends and tasty food and beverages. I have been here several times and the food is always consistently good.
Fantastic sweet potato fries! Ciabatta bread on their house burger is pretty tastee. Our server, who's name I wish I could remember now, was so good. She was a great conversationalist and walked us through almost the entire menu. . . We had a great time!
Their soups are amazing.
Good happy hour specials and the food was tasty. I just wished our waitress was as happy as the specials, but she could have been having a bad day. It happens to all of us. Overall we had a great time. I will be back for happy hour.
I honestly don't remember how many times I've been here. But is the best place for drinks, girls night out, and date night.. . The ambiance to this place was decent. The lighting was too dim. :/. The garlic fries is a must. I got those go green pasta. It was phenomenal. Everything about it was delicious.:)
Decent spot on Central Ave... Great sandwiches, good service, blah, blah, blah....
Unfortunately for me I've only been here a handful of times. I really enjoy this restaurant, I would like to come here more often. . . Great atmosphere, staff and food.
Good music..fabtastic food..Ilove the duxelle burger
I went here for lunch with an old co-worker and our friend who was visiting from Japan.. . We all had a great time! No complaints at all. The food and service were great!. . I'm sorry that there isn't much to say, but I guess less is more? :)
This is one of my favorite places to eat. The burgers are amazing. They also make delicious soups and salads. This is a great date place too.  The decor is hip without being too hip, if that makes any sense.
I am so sad they don't have a location in Chicago!! . . The staff was so sweet and accommodating. I ordered a salmon salad with green apples, carrots, etc. my husband had the spicy chicken sandwich. He loved what he got.....I loved what I got. Everything was fresh, tasted great, things were clean. . . I also got the flatbread pizza with pesto, sun dried tomato.....delicious. . . They honored something from yelp, a check in deal. And were super sweet. Their drinks looked great. And I wanted some, but we were on a road trip. So, no drinks. But....they looked so delicious! . . Healthy, fresh, and full of flavor....just what I wanted to have. Thank you so much Fez for providing healthy fresh food to us on our long road trip back to Chicago. . . Sweet campy gay guys serving! Excellent, friendly service!!!!
I've been here twice, the food is good and the cocktails are great.  During the most recent visit we were seated and then ignored.  I phoned the place from our seat and waved at the man answering the phone---then, once we got service, it was good time.  Our waitperson was super friendly, kindly apologetic, and very attentive for the rest of the evening, comping my partner's drink.  . . The single-most important "negative" for us, however, is the volume: this place is ridiculously loud (bad acoustic design?) . . . both of the times I visited I really could not hear my dining partner.  I know that makes me sound like an "old man," and I'm certainly getting there.  The atmosphere is festive and encourages people to scream at one another, I'm sure that's exactly what some diners love.  But, just know this before you go.
Super busy at lunchtime.  A great place to beat the heat.  Very attentive bartender - I sat at the bar top as I was dining alone and the restaurant was packed. The salad was delicious and I will return next time I am in Phoenix.
