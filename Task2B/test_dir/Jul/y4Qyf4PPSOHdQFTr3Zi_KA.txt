First time here and ambience is great. Wholesome atmosphere. Has a movie theater, bowling alley and pool. Great customer service...not really! . . Down falls: . 1) Very long hallways. Prepare to walk. . 2) Part of the pool area had a foul smell of sewage. Looks like it was coming from the construction work being done right beside the pool. . 3) Day 2 our card keys would not work. Had to go back several times before they had someone come up with me and try it out and was told "could be the lock that has a problem, will send up an engineer to fix it". Waited for over an hour while the rest of my party was enjoying themselves. Decided to call front desk and they said it may take hours for one available. Took 2 hours before engineer fixed it and AGAIN keys would not work! . . How it got resolved, I had to SACRIFICE my night and stay in the room so that we could have access to the room.  Receptionist that came up to see for herself that card isn't working told us nothing can be done, can't move us either because they fully booked and guy on the walkie talkie which she was talking to said we have to wait until tomorrow. . . To be exact, 9 hours of walking the long hall and going up and down the stairs several times just because of that stupid card keys and door lock. I WASTED a day in this hotel! Wanna waste your money and time stay here.
HOTEL: . Not impressed with the food or service at Red Rock at all.  We were supposed to have a suite or two connected rooms but were given two separate rooms.  We were told they had no such suites at the hotel.  The first night we didn't need the second room as our guest had not yet arrived, they tried to charge us for an empty room across the hall.  At checkout they said, "you didn't use the wifi, or this or that ... oh, no one told you it was free? No one gave you the info packet about all the things that are included with your room?"  NO!   . All in all the room(s) ended up costing twice as much as we booked.  We were supposed to be VIPs but the office was closed ... huh?  What's that got to do with it?  You'll have to wait until tomorrow to be important, sorry.. . RESTAURANTS: . None of the chefs at Red Rock deserves the title, chef.  Every meal had to be sent back.  Every one, even the steak at their fine dining restaurant.   When you encrust a steak with peppercorns you have touse CRACKED PEPPERCORNS!  Not whole rock hard peppercorns.  After nearly breaking a few teeth, literally, and hurting my jaw I said, F' this, and sent it back.  It was as if my steak was covered in pebbles.  Enjoy!. . Let me make a suggestion to the wait staff at the T bones, get and read the book, How To Win Friends and Influence People.  Our waiter was overly chummy and told me all about himself and his fantastically huge home, cars and wine cellar.  If you've read the book you know if someone has read it or not.  This man clearly had not.  (Until you've read it, you don't know why you should.  If you read it later in life, you'll probably be embarrassed that you didn't read it sooner.). . For some unknown reason the bartender/waiter at the bar in the cafe seemed to dislike me for sitting down and being alive.  He seemed annoyed just to be doing his job.  I ordered the bacon platter that came with 3 pieces of burnt bacon.  My breakfast looked like the bottom plate in a busser's tray.  I looked around and every other plate I could see looked great.  Why mine looked like crap, I don't know.  I was able to eat the two eggs, that was it.  Oddly, the next day, in the cafe, when I had four young girls with me he was very nice and catered to them quickly, same attitude toward me though, maybe worse.  His efforts and attention were completely misdirected.  The girls aren't giving him a tip, I am, or in this case probably not.  This day the bacon platter had 6 pieces of bacon.  Standards anyone?  Naaaa ....  . Here's one interaction: . May I have a blueberry bagel? . Ok. . ... . Excuse me, I haven't gotten my bagel. . Here (crash). ... . Excuse me, this isn't blueberry.  . We're out of blueberry.. Well, I don't want onion.  What else do you have?. Water.. Ok, I'll have that.. .... Excuse me, I haven't gotten my bagel ... . ... (crash). Should I just come back there and do it myself?  (I didn't say that, but I should have.). . POOL AREA: . The music at the pool area was age appropriate for teenagers sixteen and under.  The average age of people at the pool - 50!  Teenagers aren't paying bills and tipping!  Why would they cater to them?  It's idiotic.  Here's an idea, open your eyes and point them in the direction of the pool area, guess the average age of the people there, let it sink into your brain then turn off that crap music.   Silence would be much better than the sound of a dying cat combined with a repeatedly slamming door.  Also, is VPL part of the uniform of the waitresses at the pool?  . . The best thing, by far, at Red Rock are the bellmen, doormen and valets.  I gave them the biggest tips.  They were the only one's who deserved a tip.
One of the nicest hotels I have stated at ever. This was my fifth trip to vegas and decided to stay off the strip for a more laid back option. This was beyond any of my expectations.
Horrible lost and found security manager and supervisor never found our dressing shirts that were left behind in closet house keeping did not do there job right had two stay extra days because staff said nuthing showed up called 2 weeks later still nuthing all there was to say no luck sorry not even complementary stay or right us a check for the stolen items they didn't even care horrible customer service worst experience
It's a very pretty hotel. Rooms are spacious but was not that impressed with many things. First it's a room for two and there's only one robe. Usually rooms come with at least three towels. This one had two bath and one each of the other two sizes. Only one glass so I requested two more. The next day when they cleaned, they didn't even replace them.  . We've been here three days and on the first day I had eaten some starbursts. Wrappers are still by my bed three days later. Not to mention there were lipstick marks on the mirror. They're still there. . This is suppose to be a resort and there's not even a coffee maker in the room. I would have thought there were free movies in the room. NOT!! . The website said there was a free shuttle to the strip but it's only from 11:00 am to 10:00pm. If the last shuttle was full it would cost you $50 for a cab.  So if you plan on going to the strip late, not a good idea. . It's a pretty pricy hotel and in my opinion not worth with it being so far from the strip. . The pool was good. There are a few sizes and plenty of seating around but none in the shade. We ordered nachos and when the plate came out not worth the money. It cost $7.00 and there were like 7 chips. Then we asked about more chips  and it would have cost $3.00 more. We had a bottle of water and they told us we couldn't bring it in because the bar has water and we'd have to buy it there. . The buffet is actually pretty good but not at lunch. Don't recommend it. Get the players card because you get a discount if you have it. So get it! . So like I said, for the price you are paying here you could get a room on the strip and be closer to the fun.. DO NOT RECOMMEND STAYING HERE
Set the bar very high for local casino/off strip. Extremely nice and clean.  I love it every time I'm there.
Red Rock is awesome! It's always been my local casino! It has everything a person could need...bars, restaurants, a bowling alley, movie theaters and gambling. . . Recently going through some renovations and upgrades, new restaurants going in. It's bound to be better than ever! Mercadito's just opened and soon Hearthstone to follow, they are sure to last! With a new noodle bar coming in too...just you wait and see!
We are huge fans of the Red Rock Casino/resort.  Great for locals yet has enough bling to attract visitors.  Don't let the Flintstones vibe the exterior gives off fool you!  Although we kinda like it :). . The hotel rooms are modern with an elegant touch.  Must have been recently remodeled.  Clean lines on the furniture but the colors are more on the brown and burgundy side.  Its a nice change of pace from the Ultra White and Grey vibe you would get with the trendy strip hotels.  We've stayed there a couple of times and the rooms have 40 inch flat screens, marble bathroom counters and a sizable bath tub.  . . If you are bored but don't wanna drive around town looking for food and entertainment, there are decent sit-down restaurants, a food court, as well as a bowling alley and movie theatre on the premises.  . . The pool is also pretty solid but definitely book a cabana where there's guaranteed shade.  The summer sun is ridiculously dangerous here in Vegas.. . If you are looking for a solid hotel that's off strip, give red rock a shot!
I always kinda liked Red Rock ... until today.. . I was playing 2-5 NL at the Poker Room and their employee "Jennifer" approched me I had to change tables because of some rule or whatever... Everybody at the table disagreed with her - it was no longer a must-move table - whatever. I politely said "No, I'd like to stay here" She said that I must ask you to leave the poker room. I said "You really want that" - She just shook her shoulders and walked off. . . I raised the issue with Jason, the floor manager - he was trying to accomodate me but Jennifer was contantly blabbering in between our conversation. Very disrespectful. She seems to be some wanna-be bouncer at Red Rock.. . Needless to say I will take my business somewhere else in the future.
Great hotel, really impressed with the service & the quality of the room. Had room service & the lady set up our plates, pored our coffee & was super friendly. The bed (king) was new & super comfortable. Great weekend.
Bye far one of my fav casinos -- smoking free rooms that are smoking free. I didn't realize it was a station casino because I haven't seen any advertisement saying it was. . . First time ever nearly hitting my first largest pay out to date 200 bucks off of 20 dollars !!!. I was playing a few penny slots bye the b 3 parking lot ( not shure where that is in the building however near to buffet I think. ) I hit several large pay outs and nearly doubled my first bet then got more off a huge 175 dollar pay out on a penny machine. . . I haven't tried the food either the buffet, nor restaurant attached to them aka bbq restaurant and so forth. However with the amount of fun I had I will be pulling my folks from going to the strip and rather playing here. . . The casino floor was very clean i.e. meaning no beer bottles, plastic cups, cig butts in ash trays ever in the main room . I was impressed with the overall layout  = meaning signage this way to here etc.. When I went to ceasers palace the other day I got lost several times coming from vip parking. . . Overall fun experience played 20 bucks for about 2 hours you can't beat that any where. I know this is not typical however I was very happy with time spent vs winning . . . Will be back
Great hotel! Beautiful casino, rooms are huge and clean. We ate at Lucille's and mercadito. Both were accommodating to our large party. Pool was great. The staff all around was pleasant. We had to great dealers, Mark Anthony and Charlie. A lot of fun!
We had such a wonderful time, service was great,  it was clean, the staff went out of their way to help you. However, I would have given it five stars but for our bad experience with the Blackjack dealer named Helen, she was very rude to me, a beginner, she needs to repeat her customer service training again and realize there's a better way to correct someone. So if you see her table, keep walking.
I don't frequently visit this other Station Casino masterpiece but when I do, I am lovin it!!! They got bars all over, a magnificent pool area and state of the art movie theatre and concert venue and did I mentioned it is just minutes away from Red Rock Canyon, how sweet is that.  Must see and highly recommended!!!
This place was awesome our rooms where clean and spacious and we were lucky enough to get a beautiful view of Las Vegas and the strip. The rooms have a full window and allows you open the drapes from wall to wall, nothing like going to sleep with a beautiful view and waking up looking at the clouds in the sky, very peaceful. The air conditioning worked wonderfully and ran at 65 degrees during my stay. The pools were great and it wasn't crowded. It is far away from the strip but it is peaceful with a relaxed atmosphere.. . The kids have so many options with the movies, boweling and arcade. So many choices of places to eat, food court  yard house, and lucille's. . . Things that need to be worked on to make this place 5 stars is the free WiFi never is in service and won't connect and you get awful cell connection. The Grand cafe service is slow, waited an hour for 2 chicken Ceasars salads and a burger with fries.  . . Hopefully these little things will get better cause I can't wait to come back and explore the other side of Vegas red rock national mountains. Loved it
I had a nice stay at this hotel in June during the EDC weekend. I had two packages delivered to the hotel before (they accept your mail 30 days prior to your stay). USPS package arrives at the concierge and is free of charge and UPS package arrived at the business center and had a 5$receiving fee. The business center also has very restricted opening hours. . The room was clean with a nice view/overview on the strip.They lack a coffee maker or any other kitchen stuff.. The pool area is pretty big. The water is shallow, forget about swimming there. The pool staff is hand picked. All of them are very young and have very fit bodies.. The spa/gym area is relatively nice with an extra pool for swimming, cardio machines with tvs, some work out machines and barbells.. The sauna as always in the US lacks important elements as a sand-timer or a clock in sight, a thermometer and instructions on how to use a sauna as most Americans don't know what to do. Some go in there clothed, with a bottle of water and without a towel, stay there for a few minutes and don't even take a cold Bath/shower afterwards.. Inavoidable resort fee is 28.
We have stayed here many times over the years....our most recent visit was the same as the rest...3 stars--A-OK. This isn't Bellagio,Wynn or Aria..so don't expect that kind of service. For the price..you do get a decent bang for your buck!! Rooms are quite modern and always clean...bathrooms big and beautiful. We love the swimming area..lots of pools to choose from..and plenty of room to wander around. Having a movie theatre at the resort is a big plus...their food court has lots of choices....t-Bones is a decent steak house..and their sports book is way better than average. Blackjack betting areas are only OK...seem to cater more to the locals more than the tourists. Concierge printed our boarding passes on time....never any issues here. Its a breathe of fresh air away from the hustle and bustle of the strip.
I recently stayed at the Red Rock hotel with my wife and children. Let me tell it was a fantastic experience.  Outstanding service great room and the view that will give you a new appreciation for God's creation. We were on the 18th floor with a mountain view of the red rocks. You wake up in the morning and you look at that it gives you a new appreciation for life. They have done a great job of laying out the casino in terms of keeping the adult activities spaced away from where the children's activities are. They have Kids Park that will watch your children well into the morning hours so you and friends or your spouse can enjoy the hotel accommodations or all of the other amenities that the city has to offer. The hotel also has a bowling alley and movie theater. The pool is AMAZING great for a family and for single adults as well. They all have private waiting pools with cabanas and plenty of no reserved lounging and seating areas. It's also only a 20 minute drive from the Las Vegas bled. This is must try place
If you want to take the Family to Vegas this is the place. The family package that includes 2 nights stay for 2 kids and 2 adults, including 4 movie theater passes, 4 bowling passes, buffet credit is a good deal. It works out for everyone, kids have a good time and parents do some gambling....everyone wins. The only downside is that it's about 20 min away from the strip. Other than that its great.
