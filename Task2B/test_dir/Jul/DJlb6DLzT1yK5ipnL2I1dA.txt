My wife and I had a great time at Tryst on a Thursday night.  The atmosphere is very upscale and the waterfall just tops it off.  It was busy but not too crowded. Thanks to a couple bars and good bar tenders it didn't take long to get a drink or a water.. . We went to 3 clubs that week and the music was the best at Tryst if you like to dance. It was hip hop/top 40/ and a few good mash ups.. The crowd was 20's and 30'swith a few 40's. It was a good mix and it is always good people watching in Vegas.. . We got there early and were trying to take a selfie together and of the workers came over and asked if we would like him to take our picture, that was very nice of him.. . The only downfall is the dance floor is a little small, but it didn't slow us down from having a good time.. . Overall we loved it and will be back.
I went to tryst on a Saturday night, and I had a blast with my friends. I loved the red walls, the chandeliers, the waterfall, and above all the pole! Haha it was pretty fun. The music was pretty good, and I danced a lot. It's not a big club, but you can still have a great time.. . I will definitely go back, and you should check it out, too!
I went to Tryst this past weekend and I honestly had such a great time. I love how the music is primarily hip hop and songs you can actually sing to and have a good time. We ended up getting a table and it was on the cheaper side compared to other clubs. The atmosphere is fun and lively! Will be back!
I loved this place.  (no bottle service for my group and it was still fun).  The dj was great---he played Top40/80s/90s mixed with edm and it was awesome.  He read the crowded well and the dance floor had a lot of space and it did not require you to push people to keep your space.  The vibe was cool and the people overall were not douchebags or nasty (referring to guys) so you could have fun or dance with guys if you wanted to.. We booked a bachelorette here and it was AWESOME---talk to Kelly at the hotel; she set us up here to skip the line and get drink tickets.. I'm so glad we came here--check he DJS before you come to make sure you'll like the music.
Your club is bad and you should feel bad. Apparently Yelp wants me to write more than that about how terrible your club is. I could write a book about how terrible your club is and it would be longer than Atlas Shrugged and filled with more frustration than Mein Kampf. I'm standing in this club writing this on my phone which says enough about how much I hate it. Satan himself complained about the environment and said he's going back to Hell because he felt uncomfortable. If I had the option, I would join him.
Met my future wife for drinks here. Low-key gorgeous club. Not well-thought seating arrangements for VIP. Bottle service was dreadfully slow by 2:30. Multiple dance floors aren't cordoned off, so drinks have a tendency to get spilled on tables.
