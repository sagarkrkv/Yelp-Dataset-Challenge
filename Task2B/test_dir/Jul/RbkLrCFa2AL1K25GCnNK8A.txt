I stayed there recently as I accompanied my wife who was attending a convention. It was weird because when we checked in it was LVH, and by the time we checked out it had become Westgate. . . The location is great, near the strip but not on it. It is literally next to the monorail station for easy strip access ($5 each way), and for conventioneers its perfect as its right next door to the Convention Center.  Since its not on the strip it was easy to get in and out of with my rental car, which was important to me, as I was mainly there to play golf and check out Red Rock Canyon.. . The room was ok. It was in the Central Tower. The bed was comfy. The bathroom was clean and functional, which is all I really care about, though it was bit dated. It could use a makeover. I had no issues with noise or odors. Overall I was content with the room itself. We had a nice view of the golf course behind the hotel with the mountains in the distance. The room service didn't show up until around 4 pm which we found inconvenient. For the last couple of days we opted out of room service and got $8 vouchers each day for food, drink or retail at the hotel. The room had a Keurig coffee machine, but they charged $3.50 per cup! Not cool. They also had water bottles in the for $4 each. No thanks. No fridge or mini bar. That nickel and diming really cost them a star in my rating. . . The casino was ok, not too big or crowded and easy to get around. The sportsbook room is huge and was a fun place to watch the World Cup which was going on at the time. All the dealers had t-shirts on pushing the hotel's "Raiding the Rock Vault" show instead of classic dealer outfits, which cranked the class level down a notch. The hotel really pushed that show, "Classic rock by those who rocked it". I'm sorry, I can't get excited about the keyboard player from the Lita Ford band, or the replacement singer from Quiet Riot. . . I liked the pool. It wasn't packed with rowdy bachelors or bachelorettes. They had a 2-for-1 drink special for happy hour.. . The food options were ok, but nothing remarkable. On our last night, after most of the conventioneers were gone, some of the places were closed which limited our options. . . We talked with our waitress on our last night and she was excited about the change in ownership, as the new owners were promising to sink some serious money into the place. I think it's a great location (for those who aren't going simply to party), and with a refresh could become a great place.
We stayed there recently due to a conference at the Las Vegas Convention Center. One of the worst hotels we've ever stayed in. The rooms were old and missing lights and fixtures in the bathroom. There was throw up in the hall- I get it, it's Vegas but it stayed there for 2 days with the maid service walking by and no attention given, come on that's terrible. The hotel was very noisy- you could hear the room next to you, people in the hall, someone cough, it was very disturbing! The elevator wait to get to our room was over 15 mins and to get an elevator down was a joke. We tried taking the stairs one say and still couldn't wait, thank goodness there wasn't an emergency I will never stay here again, and will not let anyone I know stay here either. I've never written a negative review- this hotel is that bad. Ps-if you're staying here for a conference at the LV convention center you will have to take the monorail every day which is an extra cost.
I was playing blackjack at the hotels casino. One drunk and extremely noise women left her chips on the table and left. She came back 10 mins later and started to scream "my money, my money". She told the manager that her $600 chips are stolen. Manager looked at us the rest of the table and asked "who took her money?" He was pushy and blaming us for stealing her chips. Then he wanted to check our pockets. I spent 1 hour on that table and lost some money as all other players. They are making thousands from all of us and still have the right to accuse people with no reason. . Surprisingly, $600 chips happened to be in the women's own pockets. She was drunk and didn't know what she was saying. However manager is so careless and inexperienced that he accused other customers, so much that he wanted to check out pockets. Such a bad management, low quality casino and staff. Don't even go here and don't get fooled by any promotion etc. . . You come to vegas to have fun and play games, if you come LVH what you will get is a treatment like you are a pice of sht.
A 1.5, rounding down. The staff deserve some stars. Aside from the corporate Westgate timeshare gimmicks, they were generally very cool. . . We were taken to the 'welcome desk' after checking in. The staff have been trained by this corporation to prey on ignorant vacationers in a very sleazyand manipulative way. We had no idea that all the freebies they were 'giving' us had anything to do with a timeshare presentation...till I asked what the catch was about 10 mins in. They're like pushy car salesmen, but way worse. Very disrespectful and don't take NO for an answer. Left a bad taste in my mouth and certainly won't be returning to the LVH because of this. Gross. If you stay here, just get your keys and ignore anyone till you're in your room. . . We booked through getaroom.com. It was cheap and we got no more than what we paid for. The bathroom had its original pink 70s tile, its lighting was sterile, and the shower faucet was weak and falling apart. There was a noticeable red stain on the carpet, possibly blood. Something they definitely should've noticed while cleaning. Like a cheap motel. And our TV quality was junk. Our friends' room was a lot nicer, so I'm guessing they put the cheap bookies into the cheaper rooms. The pool was filled with families and kids, so don't expect to relax or have a Vegas pool party experience here. Monorail access was great though!
Place kinda sucks. If you're going to a convention, it'll be convenient to stay here, but I'd stay elsewhere. Let's see... shower water is cold (shower early, it'll at least be warm), a in-house restaurant closed the doors on me during their normal business hours, they charge $4 for in-room rot-gut coffee (maybe that's normal for vegas), and even the in-house starbucks doesn't stock all their menu items. Gotta pay for wifi too.
Note to Westgate - You recently lost a loyal customer because of your rude, aggressive timeshare sales people.  Oh, how I miss the Hilton (and the LVH)!   This has been our hotel of choice for many, many years.   After the LVH purchased the hotel from the Hilton, things drastically went downhill.  We still continued to patronize the place because we always loved the service that we got there, but after our experience last week, we will never be back.  As in "ever". . . 1.  After driving twelve hours, we arrived to find approximately 12 Westgate employees hovering around the front desk.  Not behind the desk.  In front of the desk.  This was the first day of the takeover.  The desk clerk checking us in was very rude.  The large tip that I gave him upon arrival made no difference in the way that I was treated. There was a mix-up with our reservation, and the guy would not budge.    After going back and forth with him for an hour, he finally gives me my keys and tells me that a hostess will "be right there to assist you with your room".  What the heck?!?  Here comes a lady in a Westgate vest who then takes me to another desk.  After waiting there for twenty minutes and listening to the lady behind the desk try to talk the couple in front of me into a timeshare presentation, I interupted and said "Excuse me, I need to get to my room. I am not feeling well". The lady said, "Oh, ok, but just make sure that you come back here".   Are you kidding me?!?  Maybe Westgate should have emailed everyone who had reservations to give them the heads up of the changeover and, also, inform them that everyone was going to be confronted by their sales people vultures every time they came or went anywhere. It got very old, very fast.  The place seemed very classless with all of the timeshare crap.  . . 2. While in Vegas, I purchased a new Lincoln. Drove from the dealer straight to the Westgate and parked with valet.  The next morning, I retrieved my car from valet and drove to The Westin at Lake Las Vegas where we had rented a cabana. Upon getting out of my new vehicle, and walking around the back, I see that I had been keyed.  Upon returning  to the Westgate and informing valet that I was keyed, I was told that the valet lot is a "secure area".  Any idiot can see that it is not a secure area.  Any person can walk right in there from the sidewalk in front of the hotel.  . . 3. VERY creepy people hanging out around the hotel and, also, inside the hotel. Yikes!. . 4. We had a pool lanai room. Our view right in front of our room was four very dead rosemary plants. You would think the gardeners would have removed them. . . Run people!. . The pros:. . 1. Tatuado. LOVE this place and it's employees. . . 2. The Resorts Club Room. Love this place and it's employees also.
I don't have high expectations when I stay off the strip. I do, however, expect a level of service at least sub-par to what I'm paying. . . This hotel is a convenient 5-min drive from the strip. Other than that...  am I even in Vegas??. . Drinks here are pricey yet weak. Elevators were extremely slow, sometimes a 5 minute wait.. . Rooms were clean. Beni Hana's was cool. ...I've experienced better.
I live here in Vegas and good friends came to stay at the LVH (now the Westgate) and I met up with them (at the hotel) for two days during their stay.. . The good:. . The Vince Neil Cantina (in the hotel) serves truly excellent food. (I will be writing a review regarding that experience.). . My friend, as well as her husband, stated that their bed was comfortable.. . Their room did have a small refrigerator in the bar console. (*Disclosure notice: The refrigerator was there, probably, because they had an upgraded room. I doubt that all of the rooms have a refrigerator....). . . The bad:. . The AC was blasting and made the room really, really cold. The temperature could not be adjusted in order to make the room a comfortable temperature. My friend resorted to wrapping herself up in a blanket in order to be comfortable. For the duration of their (several day) stay - she wore a sweatjacket whilst in their room.. . When (on the very rare occasions) the AC *did* shut off - it sounded like someone was kicking the door in. I heard this happen, twice. Everyone in the room jumped when it happened (both times).. . The showers did not offer hot water more times than not. My friend had reported the issue (and she had mentioned being able to have one shower with hot water) - but, for the rest of their stay it was cold shower central.. . A brown flotsom was discovered in their shower stall. My friend could not determine the cause of the foam with brown specks in it residing near the drain of their shower. (It had bubbled up through the drain pipes...but the reason for that happening was unclear.). . The restaurants have really strange, inconvenient hours. Considering that Vegas is a 24-hour town...it was incredibly difficult to find a restaurant in which to eat at 9:00 p.m. - and, again, around 5:00 p.m. (Those times are pretty reasonable. I was shocked to discover that most of the LVH/Westgate restaurants were not open for meals during those time frames.). . The ugly:. . The casino floor (which you have to walk through in order to get to the convention center, shops and restaurants) is absolutely filled with smoke. The worst I've experienced in *any other* hotel, anywhere. On (or off) The Strip. I doubt that filtration units are being put into service, at all.. . There was a loud, drunken exchange outside their room at 3:00 in the morning (which awakened everyone in their family) during their stay. They were there for an event in which they had to be awake, early - so the drunken exchange should have been attended to by Security. But it wasn't. The drunken brawlers did (finally) exit the area of their own accord...but they never should have been allowed to disturb hotel guests for as long as they did. Hotel Security needs to be improved.. . There is a $3.50 charge for a cup service package (drinking cup, Keurig K cup and, more than likely, creamer and sugar). At $3.50 PER CUP I can assure you that no one opened a package in order to discover exactly what was inside the coffee cup service package. With LVH/Westgate charging $3.50 (per cup) for hotel room coffee - it could be argued that the "free" drinks served to gamblers in Las Vegas casinos are no longer the most expensive drinks in town. $3.50 for room coffee is highway robbery. Most of the hotels offer a coffee pot along with free packages of regular--and decaffeinated--coffee. It is absolutely stunning that LVH/Westgate grossly overcharges what should be (and is, anywhere else in Vegas...) a basic room amenity.. . There is a $14.50 charge (per person, per device) for WiFi. Again...this charge is highway robbery. Most of the hotels offer free WiFi. *Motels* sometimes charge for WiFi service (but even they charge a much lower rate) ... But you are not paying motel prices to stay at the LVH/Westgate.. . The name of the hotel was changed just prior to the arrival of my friends - and they were not made aware of the change ahead of their arrival. In this day and age - the hotel should have (at the very least) sent their incoming hotel guests an email letting them know of the change. Not one of their guests were made aware of the change until they arrived, confused, at their hotel - the hotel which carried an entirely new name on the (small) marquee and no name at all on the large marquee. LVH/Westgate's marketing/branding regarding this takeover needed to be handled better and more gracefully than what (clearly) ended up happening. . . Overall (and all things considered) LVH/Westgate services, room, staff and amenities are not what one would expect when staying at a Las Vegas Strip resort. I have visited (as well as stayed at) many Las Vegas hotels on the Strip (and off). I would never recommend staying at this hotel. I think there are far better options available for consumers, trade show attendees, conference attendees and tourists. (Though I will say, again, that the Vince Neil Cantina has truly awesome food. That restaurant is well worth visiting. Just choose a different hotel in which to stay....)
We knew we were going to get in late on a Thursday night, so we decided just to book one night here for $21 on Groupon. . . We were actually pleasantly surprised by the casino floor. They had plenty of slots, a late night snack food restaurant and a lounge. It kept us entertained for a few late night hours after we got in, which was awesome since it is located off the strip and we were too lazy to drive anywhere.. . The rooms on the other hand were just OK. I think my only complaint would be the shower leaking the entire time we were there. I was so grossed out by the towel inside the shower used to soak up the water that was dripping that I even avoided showering until we checked in to our other hotel. Other than that...the beds were comfy, there was plenty of room and it was quiet.. . Overall...if I'm looking for something cheap, I will most definitely consider this hotel.
LVH is a good casino and hotel. I have stood here a few times with family. The casino is very convenient when you don't want to stay on the strip. It is just literally down the street and if you're a person who likes to go out while you're in vegas and doesn't want to spend too much money on a hotel, then this is the place to stay. I have to agree the outside of the Hotel it does need an update... Inside of the hotel, has a variety of slot machines and tables like any other casino. One time we got coupons with free accommodations and that was a plus or with discounted stuff we can use while we stood there. . . The only problem we had is when I went with my parents and sibling... My parents wanted a smoking room and we got a non smoking and we had to wait for a bit and the one with the non smoking I remember some things were broken in the room so good thing we switched anyways. It took awhile but, still was worth a wait cause our rooms were better then non smoking. Anyways I stood there this past december again with family & boyfriend and my boyfriend and I had no problems even the staff were nice as well. I have probably stood here about 5 times and we havent had any problems. I might be going at the end of this month since we have a rate on a room that my boyfriend & I are gonna use. . . We ended up getting a delxue room last dec and the rooms were really nice and we ended up getting a view. We also had a free accommodation of the buffet it was okay , they had alot also as well. just thought it was kinda small. But so far every trip we've had here was pretty good. I like the environment and the casino. Other then the hotel being just a tad updated... I would continue to stay here if I didnt have to stay on the strip, I would definitely come back!
So we went to check in at LVH, now called Westgate.  It took us 40 minutes at least. Apparently your prepaid reservation does not take into account your room preferences such as 2 queens vs 1 king when you have 3 people, or that you requested non smoking vs smoking.  We also requested the newly renovated tower, which according to them we got after the 40 minute search, only to find that the carpet is all torn up, the chair is absolutely filthy and we found a dog toy stuffed into the sheets of the bed, which means they did not change the sheets from the last visitors.  So disgusting. I don't even know what else to say. It's 10:20 pm and I can't check I someplace else, so housekeeping is on their way up.  Ugh is all I can stay. The price may be right but you can do better.
This hotel is awesome! I believe it is very under rated because before this use to be the Hilton Las Vegas Hotel. I actually stayed here before it even went under the new name of LVH and seem's to be even better! The hotel staff is aalways courteous and very accommodating to locals! They run specials for locals during the weekdays where you can get rooms as low as $22! What a steal! I love the casino tables as well! Especially Blackjack. I would recommend this hotel to anybody who is on a budget and doesn't mind staying OFF the strip. Afterall it is literally a block away anyways. 4 stars for me!
There is a resort fee on top of the regular price. So one would expect resort amenities, right? Hah!!!!. Charge for coffee in the room. Charge for bottled water in the room. Free wifi for only 1 device a day and it has to be re-registered daily. Towel quality one would find at Motel 6. NO towel racks in bathroom. No magnifying mirror in bathroom. TV channel selection is horrible. Pool has loud DJ music and only open until 8 pm . . Service in cafe is poor, food is OK. We were there for a hockey tournament in the convention center. Signage from one building to the next leaves you going in circles. So unless you are forced to stay there for some convention- stay clear
The time I went was busy too busy. So a lot of the staff was fucking up my room wasn't ready until after 10 pm and I checked in at 7 got to my room and the maid was still in there cleaning. She rushed and left so I'm not even sure if the room was even cleaned.  Went to vegas for a conference and a lot of other things were happening at the convention center at the same time as my conference next to LVH. Basketball tournament, skin show, hair show all kind of event's were all happenings at the the same time. Had a bad experience but the manager was so professional handle everything perfectly that I'm not too bother. If it wasn't for how professional this manager handle things, LVH would of got a 1 star from me. Manager small asian guy with a glasses. He deserves a reward.
I stayed here because I was going to a conference at the convention center and this looked like the most convenient hotel. It might have been slightly more convenient but if you are going for a conference, don't let that be the only thing that sways you into staying here. You can take the monorail from a better hotel and get to the conference center easily.. . My room was clean and average. I wondered if the sheets had been changed as they were kind of wrinkly but i ignored that. I was pleased at how quiet it was despite being a Las Vegas hotel. The buffet was small but the food was excellent and the people who worked there were nice, as were thepeople who worked in the small cafe. The casino is tackier than most and pretty small and the smell of cigarette smoke was very bad. If you order a drink at the bar make sure you tell them that you don't want the well drinks, as those are awful.. . I enjoyed the sports book because there is a non-smoking area and I could just sit there and watch the baseball game for hours on end. . . I really got ticked off at the $15 per day per device wifi fee they charged me. Also, beware that you don't open the bottle of water they leave you or use the coffee. They will charge you an arm and a leg for it.
I really don't understand the snarky reviews. We've stayed at LVH for years. We've always had very nice rooms. And uber cheap. I agree casino isn't massive. Don't understand $20 resort fee. But when in Vegas! Maybe new owners will make some positive changes,who knows. Great front desk staff. In fact we're returning next month.
This hotel is decent for the affordable price, I've stayed here one time before and didn't have a problem with cleanliness or maintenance. This time, the night front desk agent Mark, was extremely professional, helpful and polite ! The rock vault was a great show and got it for free!
LVH aka:Westgate Hotel is awesome!! I really enjoyed all my previous stays "I recommend you stay in one of the suites preferably on the 29th floor breathtaking balcony view!" LVH hotel staff are very professional, convenient location approx.1 or 2 blocks away from the LV strip nightlife, monorail station, pool, gym, clubs, shows, awesome restaurants, great sports book & casino. In essence, I LOVE the LVH it's the best value for your money.
