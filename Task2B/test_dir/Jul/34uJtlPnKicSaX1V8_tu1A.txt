It's hard to believe the 5-diamond, all-suite Venetian Hotel rose from the dust of the Sands way back in 1999. The opulent Casino, famous Grand Canal Shoppes, 24-hour Race & Sports Book, and large Suite Hotel Rooms (with sunken living room and Italian-marble baths) are just a few reasons the Venetian still reigns as a spectacular destination for an unforgettable Las Vegas vacation.. . Of course, the Venetian is inspired by Venice, Italy (sorry, California). Several detailed replicas of landmarks from Europe's most beautiful city include Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square) with Campanile di San Marco (St. Mark's Campanile Bell Tower) and columns for the Lion of Venice and Saint Theodore. Other notable reproductions are Palazzo Ducale (Doge's Palace), Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge), and Ponte dei Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs). . . Here are your best bets for a good time at the Venetian:. . Rooms.  * There are more than 4,000 suites at the Venetian.  * Luxury Suites with King bed are standard & 650 sq ft.  * A 700 sq ft Bella Suite has 2 Queens for about $30 more.  * For either, about $40 upgrades to a Suite with a View.  * A Venetian Piazza Suite is 1400 sq. ft and only $150 above Luxury.  * Another $50 can get you a Venetian Prima Suite (1500 sq ft).  * Rates get high for larger Renaissance & Penthouse Suites.  * An In-Suite Breakfast offer is available, but not my style.  * The Venezia Tower is newer, but may not be for everyone.  * Book online & check discount packages for the best deals.  * Daily resort fee: $25 + tax ($3): Fitness Center, Internet, & 1 coffee. . Dining.  * 15 Fine Dining ($$$$) restaurants are tempting.  * Recommend CUT, Bouchon, Delmonico, AquaKnox, or SUSHISAMBA.  * Over 20 casual eateries will fit more budgets.  * Try Public House or B&B Burger & Beer.  * Grand Lux Cafe is open 24 hours.  * The Venetian has several bars to get your drink on. . Shows & Activities.  * Tao Beach & Night Club is THE club at Venetian.  * The Race & Sports Book is uniquely open 24/7.  * Rock of Ages musical (Tix: $69-$167).  * Panda! features Chinese Acrobats at Palazzo ($68-$158).  * Lipshtick rotates female stand-up comedians ($75-$120).  * Human Nature has Australians singing Motown ($74-$118).  * Get married (if you must) at one of their Wedding locations.  * The DaVinci Exhibit was a waste of $27.50 to see replicas.  * Canyon Ranch SpaClub isn't cheap, but you're on vacation.  * Semi-romantic types can ride a gondola indoors and out. . Shopping.  * Grand Canal Shoppes has shops along an indoor canal.  * The stores are open 10am - 11pm (midnight on Fri/Sat).  * More than 160 stores with mall favorites, boutiques, & high-end.  * Louboutin, Burberry, Ferragamo, & Fendi are highlights.  * Some will like Jimmy Choo, Coach, DvF, or Michael Kors.  * It'Sugar is always sweet.  * Many of the restaurants are located along the Grand Canal. . Parking & Location.  * Near the North end of the Vegas Strip by its sister, The Palazzo.  * Across from the Mirage and Treasure Island.  * Free parking is in an 11-story parking garage.  * Follow signs from main Venetian entrance.  * Valet is easier sometimes if you don't mind waiting & hate walking. . The Venetian Resort Hotel and Casino is a truly remarkable Vegas Strip hotel offering upscale value and amenities for reasonable prices. It should be one of the first places you check for reservations before any trip to Las Vegas.
Just got back from 2nd trip out to Vegas and The Venetian ~ and The Venetian is starting to show its age and the level of service has dropped since our last visit about 3 years ago. Then I would have given it 4.5 stars.. Last time the room was pristine. This time our room looked a bit tired. This time westayed in the larger Piazza Suite, last time the smaller Luxury Suite.. Last time we were supplied with luxury robes and a coffee pot. This time no robes, and we were told coffee pots were a liability now. However, the was no issue with hot irons, as there was one of those as well as a blow dryer in the suite. It was suggested we use room service. I just think after spending $200-$300 a night, a cup of tea or coffee when one wants it isn't asking a lot. Having to spend $15 plus a tip and after waiting 20-30 minutes any time the mood hits for tea or coffee is just ridiculous.. This time out room had not been totally cleaned from the last guests. There was a crude and lewd drawing hanging on the chandelier and there was not adequate towels linens or pillows. These were brought up within 15 minutes of request with apology. . There was also construction going on. I never saw it or understood what was being done, but it went on all week from 7am - Yep SEVEN AM until 8pm. I requested a day comp for the week. That apparently was too much to ask, but they did take off the "Resort Fees" for the week.. Linens on bed were fresh and clean. Appeared not to be worn, as were towels. But the edges around the bathroom were starting to show wear. The carpeting and fixtures.. Wi-fi is terrible (but free) and phone reception on AT&T and Sprint very spotty.. Housekeeping was friendly and attentive.. We dined at several restaurants at resort and still find the Grand  Lux Cafe' to be the best breakfast, lunch or dinner. It's not the finest dining, but the food and service and what you get for the money is the best. The Bouchon is finer dining good for breakfast too, didn't care so much for lunch/dinner. Out in the Canal there are some other good choices for lunch and dinner.. None of the shows we saw this trip were at the Venetian, so can't comment on these this visit.. Did a little gambling at the V this time. Cocktail waitresses were very pleasant and accommodating. Many of the dealers seemed bored. We saw several slot machines that were missing lights. However, compared to many other resorts, this casino is one of the better ones as far as variety and volume of business.. Gym is adequate and clean. Canyon Ranch even went down hill :(. Next time we go back to Vegas, we won't stay here again
The room was absolutely gorgeous! I stayed ina suite with my bestfriend for EDC. The service was REALLY SLOW. The pool was small but  good size to relax by in the sun. Deffinately wouldn't stay here again just because it's more for the older crowd. Fell in love with our room and the bathroom it was beautiful and very LIT UP. This hotel was way to far from our event we were attending also.. The cab service was super fast and everytime we got a great cab driver!.
I love this hotel, stay here for my 21st bday and we didn't have to leave out hotel at all everything we wanted to do is inside this hotel, shopping, dinning, clubbing and pool party! Yep they have it all. I love how I can just walk to my room after the club or pool party
My son and I stayed at the Venetian for 9 days, attending a conference in the hotel.. . What amazed me was that every employee -- I mean *every* employee --- was pleasant, helpful, and seemed to be enjoying their job. Whether they were actually happy, I'll never know. But the attitude of the employees made it a pleasure to stay,  shop, and eat at the hotel.. . As a contrast, one afternoon we ended up at the Flamingo for lunch. The employees there didn't seem to care much -- they didn't care when we got seated, how long it took to get  water (it was 102F outside, so we were thirsty), or how long until our order was taken. The service wasn't bad, but the attitude of the staff was noticeably lacking.. . Back to the Venetian: Breakfast at the Bouchon was fantastic. I had a simple spinach omelet. The eggs were amazingly good. No overpowering flavor, but a perfect texture.Servers were very attentive.. . We also ate at Grande Lux Cafe several times. Breakfast from the menu was good, but only $5 less than the Bouchon for similar dishes. (So for a bit more, you can eat at Bouchon.) The breakfast buffet was great. Lots of fruit, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, an omelet station, and more. Finally, dinner at the Grande Lux was the best out of several restaurants in the hotel. (Admittedly, we did not try any of the high-end restaurants. I heard good things about Carne Vino and I'll wager that Delmonico and others are simply amazing.) At Grand Lux I had the Sicilian Pasta, which had a combination of sausage and chicken with a light tomato sauce served over spaghettini. Chicken was tender, sausage was flavorful, as was the light tomato sauce. The pasta was perfectly cooked.. . Oh. And we also had the fried calamari as an appetizer. I have never had calamari that was so tender -- It melted in my mouth. It was also a huge portion -- we shared it among 2, but it could have easily been shared among 3 or 4 diners.. . While I had almost no experience with other hotels in Las Vegas, I can say that the Venetian was a wonderful place, with comfortable rooms, good restaurants, friendly staff, and a great conference center.
The king suite has large old couch that isfading in color. They could afford the other furniture to replace but kept an old couch. See pic. Also, bathroom light is low where anyone can walk in and see you using it. Thank god, I have no guests. Venetian should be a 3 star hotel.. . Dropped to one star for our stay there.
July 5th, 2014: They get a 1 star for customer service before I even get there. I had a 4 day reservation for a conference. They received the check; it was paid for in full. Out of courtesy, I called to let them know that I wouldn't be able to keep the 4th day due to a scheduling conflict.I could have kept the reservation for 4 days because I wasn't paying for it personally, but I was courteous. When I called back to advise them that I could keep the 4th day, they tried to charge me extra for the 4th day! The reservations clerk kept me on hold for fifteen minutes while he talked to the manager on duty (guaranteed it wasn't the real manager on a holiday weekend). The manager advised the "customer de-service rep" to advise me that they wouldn't honor my 4th day (again already paid for) but would offer me the "current deal."  What kind of used car salesman BS is this?! Commission - he charges me extra for a room already paid for and he gets the extra money?   The Venetian was trying to flim-flam me for more money when they are probably making a hundred thousand on the next week with this massive conference? Guess it better be a really stellar experience for me to upgrade after getting hosed down like this before I even get into town.
Having been to the Venetian several times, it truly is wonderful. You walk into the place and it is dripping with elegance and very worthy of its 5 diamond rating. There's so much to do in this place that it is a vacation in and of itself. I think it's fitting that this place stands where the Sands used to stand. The Sands in its heyday was the height of class, and the Venetian proudly carries that torch.. . They spent a tremendous amount of time, research, architectural detail, and of course money to make this place what it is. I've gamed there many times and what stood out to me was how nice and friendly everyone was, right down to the pit bosses. . . The only thing that keeps me from staying there is that constant incense smell that is overpowering when you walk in. Yes, it smells nice, but it dries my eyes out and stuffs my nose up, so I've always defaulted to choosing the Bellagio over the Venetian. But I love visiting and just spending time looking around.
Want to feel like a star in Vegas?  This place will make you feel like trash .... . Booked two connecting rooms.  One wasn't ready.  Was told it will be ready anywhere between 4pm and midnight ... really helpful when you just flew in and would love to shower. . . Manger got us connecting rooms since the first two we waited hours for were not connecting,  cool.   Then we walked to them ... 10 minute walk,  two sets of elevators,  and 8 long hallways later ... . . Let's not forget they locked us out of our one previous room preventing us from getting our belongings. . . Oh,  let's not forget that the front desk doesn't answer the phone,  at all .... . I've been to Vegas tons of times,  hands downs,  shittiest customer service I have ever experienced.
We stayed here six days.  The rooms, restaurants and service were fantastic.  Some of the best chefs in the world are on restaurant row. A coffee maker in the room would have been nice. Great location.
"I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life." - Jerry Seinfeld. . Excellent stay -  2nd time here and even though I left  some blood on the poker tables, I will be back.  Piggybacked on my wife's conference stay for a few days.  It was my 9 yr old's 1st Vegas trip, so I decided to try to make it memorable:. . Check-in was the only thing holding this back from a 5 star rating.  Some confusion on corporate vs. personal credit cards left a 1K hold/charge on our personal credit card for several days, even when reversed. This would've been a bummer if we didn't have plenty of credit line.  I think the front desk person was "new".  Take note, 1st impressions COUNT, this could have ruined someones whole trip.  Quick bite dinner at the Lobster place in the shopping area, pricey but excellent.  Walk up espresso and pastries European style was inexpensive and spot on.. . Rest was gravy... The grounds are beautiful and kept up well.  All the rooms suites w/ sunken living rooms, big bathrooms, lots of space to stretch out.  The Venezia tower is a bit of a trek from the main hotel (12 minutes from the casino floor), at least it has it's own pool.  The pool complex is fairly large, the huge main pool is busy with tons of people watching.  TAO Beach (European/topless) is steps always, cleverly camouflaged by jungle foliage. There is a pool near the spa, with it's own cabanas, a little more mellow. When staying at the Venetian you can also access the pools of the Palazzo.  . . Cabana - Grabbed a cabana near the main pool, service was great - it was really hot, like 107 most of the afternoon.  Without a shaded base of operations, you really can't hang out there by the pool very long. TOTALLY worth it for the day.  The 9 year old loved getting snacks & daqueris brought to her like a little princess.  The pool host even came out to the pool when we were swimming and brought us drinks.. . Food & Libations - Bouchon was great, casino bartenders do a good job w/ my Manhattans... burger & pizza joint in the main hotel/casino area open 24/7 and were pretty good.  You want  MEAT?  4 steakhouses on prem.  HEAVEN, plus a burger stuffed w/ foie gras... YUM!. . We'll be back!
Only went to the casino.  It was decent.  Well lit and clean.  I'd go back.
We were very excited to be staying at the Venetian, and thought we would enjoy our time. . After checking in we quickly walked around and got food, upon returning later that night we realized one of the pillows had a murky stain which looked like muddy make up . We then looked at the bed frame and saw how disgusting it was. Full of dust. We called to have the pillows replaced. Also we mentioned how dusty it was. We had a reservation on the strip but waited 30min for them to bring us the new pillows. We finally received a bag with a box of tissues (for us to wipe up the dust how awful) and only 1 pillow. We voiced our issues again and said we needed more than 1 pillow, but didn't have time to wait again and went out to make the reservation. When we came back nothing was delivered or changed. We called again and asked to speak with customer service, and a manager. We only got a voice mail and left a message. We never got our pillows and had to sleep without them that night, the bed frame was horrible dusty and dirty, and the sofa in the room were missing buttons, and also had stains. No one every reached out to us, we got the run around, and still trying to contact someone about the matter. Do not stay at this hotel. I read the bad reviews but assumed our stay would be different. So disappointed, and this was our anniversary. Not lavish nor was it superb service. Glad we got another hotel off the strip that was very accommodating, and the rooms were clean
Best hotel on the strip!!! My wife and I enjoy staying at a different hotel just about every time we go to Vegas. We have stayed at a dozen or more hotels and the Venetian blows them all out of the water. The overall service and quality of this place were fantastic.. . The rooms are all suits and when I first walked into our room, I began calculating how much it would cost to just move in. The king sized bed was as comfortable as any bed I have stayed in at a hotel. The view from our window was a great view of the strip and of the volcano show at the Mirage across the street. The bathrooms are huge, and so is the living room area with each room has. There are 3 TVs in the room, and have a channel for everyone.. . When we had our room turned over the house keeping staff was amazing. Everyone was friendly and we had a great time.. . My family has been in the hotel business for over 30 years and I have been to more hotels then I can count. The overall experience of The Venetian is second to none that I have been to. Worth every penny!
Too bad no negative stars. The room smelled like a filthy taxi-cab...body odor and curry. I was too tired to change rooms because there would be a wait for non-smoking. I couldn't take it after the second day and left early on what was supposed to be a 4 day. Keep in mind - I wasn't even paying to stay here because I was on conference and I still left early. There are people in front on the sidewalk handing out fliers that state that the health department found bodily fluids on sheets, comforters, and furniture. I can actually believe it now - you want to lounge around in a Jizz-Palace, go for it; bring your black-light and get a free show when you turn out the lights! I can't believe this place is the Venetian that people raved about. No one at upper-management cares about your complaints, so don't bother. This isn't big business, It's MONSTER business and you're an ant....a piss ant. I don't know if the fliers are true or not, but from the funk smell in my suite, it makes me wonder. Someone wrote about "bed-bugs" but I didn't see anything like that (they probably couldn't stand the smell and moved to a smoking room).  The food-court is pathetic, crowded, and consists of wannabe-trendy eateries with jacked-up prices and slammed down quality. Johnny Rockets Burgers: Cheeseburger, fries, and shake was $22.00 and it sucked! The Panda Express also sucked. There's a Nathan's where you can get a hot-dog with grilled onions for $6.00 (that was okay actually). The tower suites are really set up weird - like a labyrinth. You take an elevator up, walk a long maze, and then take another one up to the suites. I saw a few lost drunks confused and bewildered; I helped one, but another I sent to the parking garage elevator just for kicks...I was bored. The fridge has a motion-detector - if you move an item they will charge you for it. That's some nickle and dime shit for the grand Venetian isn't it? Inventory your snacks and call it down - an $8.00 snack was missing from my tray when I came in, apparently the funk-monster that was defiling my suite had to grab a snack for the road. #VenetianIsFroggyFunk
Loses 1 star for their new 6-to-5 blackjack payout at tables for the hoi polloi.  Was at their casino night of Sat/12 Jul and only the $50+ minimum tables paid 3-to-2 blackjacks, whereas the $25 and $15 tables was 6-to-5.. . Pros:. - Huge rooms and great location so my friends' bachelor party groups tend to stay here.  Walking distance to XS/Tryst/Surrender and of course Venetian has Tao/Lavo.. - Grand Canal Shoppes and swank selection of restaurants including CUT.
3 stars because... we were at the pool today, and a certain waitress named Denise had an issue with serving "homosexuals". We were one row behind others she was serving and she told us she wouldn't open a tab because... "you're not really in my section"... ?. . Waitress Jordan saved the day and received a 50% tip. Bite it Denise.
We went to Las Vegas to celebrate my husband's birthday....our kids and their other half joined us (yay!) so we wanted to stay together as a family.. We originally were supposed to stay at the Palazzo with 2 adjoining suites....but then the opportunity to get a Penthouse at the Venetian came up.....soooooo since we were able to get it at a special rate....we took it!. The suite usually goes for $5,000/night....3000 sq feet, 2 bedroom with 3 bathrooms and a sauna....the only thing we were missing was a swimming pool in the room..... The place was decorated very luxuriously and it even came with a grand piano!.. . There was lots of room and we all enjoyed it...if you ever have a chance to stay in their penthouse, go for it!...my husband enjoyed all of the remote controlled curtains, dimmer lights and TVs and telephones in every room!...Lots of space for everyone to hang out and even get some work done...it was great watching the World Cup on the big screen TVs and being able to run downstairs to place their bets....
First time staying at The Venetian in a Bella Suite room.  This hotel and room far exceeded our expectations!!! Check-in went smoothly and our room was ready 30 minutes early-considering we were there during 4th of July holiday. Room had 2 queen beds and a sunken living room. Bathroom - kids loved the TV in there!! Bathroom had it's own toilet room, 2 sinks, separate walk-in shower and soaking tub, and vanity area.  Room was clean and even had a Housekeeping Supervisor stop by after we checked in to inspect the room and if it meet our expectations! Best thing - they offer a military discount!!
This hotel has literally become a second home for me. I have to travel to Vegas for work multiple times a year and this hotel treats you great! The shops and restaurants are all amazing! The dealers at the tables are extremely courteous. I highly, highly recommend staying here! Its worth every penny!
Beautiful hotel.  Excellent staff!  Saved me from a horrible 3 days at Rio hotel.
Nice hotel room but bad customer service. Aside from the fact that the hotel rooms are nice, the food options in the hotel are pretty bad. Additionally, 10 am check outs after a night of drinking is absurd. I will never choose to stay at this hotel mainly for that reason. Vegas is Vegas. If you expect to have fun in Vegas, don't stay at this hotel bc you have to check out by 10 and if you ask for a late check out, 11 am, they'll reject you. No thanks. Never again.
This resort looks gorgeous in the inside. I can only imagine the rooms. I loved the ceiling in the main area and they even have little gondola rides. Drink service in the casino was excellent.  Maybe next time we'll stay here for a new experience.
I have always liked the Venetian, many marvelous memories over the last 15 years. There has been some revamping and lots of new additions but the basics are still intact, gondolas, day and night sky, some of the old restaurants, the noodle house, the suites are fabulous, very large and ornate and great VFM, sometimes you cangrab them for under $200 a night.  New slot machines and a good crowd.  One of the first choices when selecting accommodation.
I recently stayed at the Venetian Hotel in La Vegas recently and had a bad experience.  I left my car with the valet and when I checked out the car was smashed in the front and rear and had over 7k worth of damage.  I asked a few questions about their security policies and was given the run around a real lack of honesty and transparency.  When i left my car there were 126 miles to empty and when i picked it up there were 98 miles to empty, i noticed because i knew i had to get gas the next day - did someone take a joy ride?  . . They passed me over to their Risk Management group, who treated me like a slip and fall case, no customer service, no apology and after many calls and emails (1.5 months) i was told by a senior hotel manager that they would offer me a free night, but not on New Years Eve.  They treat you as a customer when your spending money, eat at their restaurants, play at their tables, but when they do something wrong and don't tell the truth about the event or process and you are thrown to their insurance company.  Can't even find a customer service executive on their site.. . I then received a call from an man who represented himself as an investigator from the hotel.  He asked me about my stay, I retold my experience with the valet parking and damage of my car.  He was very nice, stated he understood my concerns and thought process around the damage of my car and loss of value.  It was my feeling that he agreed with my perspectives or at least that was the what i understood by what he said.  He said he would call me back and that was a month ago.. . I would never stay at a Sands hotel again.  Service is service, my car lost approx. 6k-9k in value from one of their employees smashing the front and back of my car - not sure how you even do that.  No one admitted to the damage and they would of let me leave the hotel with out anyone saying anything.  Didn't know Mr. Adelson ran his hotels like this.  Very disappointed, very unsatisfied - hate being lied to.
I stayed there for a work conference.  Rooms are large, spacious, and comfortable and affordably-priced.  Room service food was excellent.   Staff are very accommodating and helpful.  Mind you, I am not a fan of Vegas.  I've never gone there for fun because "Vegas fun" is not my kind of fun.  I've stayed at Caesar's, Flamingo, Paris/Bally's and some of the older hotels many times and am glad I got to stay in the Venetian this last time.
Very nice and clean place. Great rooms and are quiet. Lots of variety and much to do.. . Defiantly, give it a try if you need a quality night.
Wow i like the design of the hotel just like In italy the service is very good the hotel is very big and classy and it was a very good experience
I am truly impressed with this resort. All suites here & the grounds are awesome.  The staff greet you with a smile and are more than willing to attend to you. Worth every dime!
I stayed here on a previous trip to Vegas.  Place is fabulous!   Impressive rooms and facilities.   LOVED IT!!
Ah the venetian... where you can travel the famous venice canals by canoe.. . I mean gondolas.. . The shops and food around the lobby is great, but navigating around the rooms is like going through a labyrinth. I stayed here for 2 days, and trying to find my room was like trying to find Amelia Earhart's aircraft!  . . All in all, it was an enjoyable stay, but much prefer the Cosmo over this place!
Best place to stay in Vegas.. Expensive, wish there was free breakfast :P
As I understand it, the Venetian is currently undergoing a significant room renovation. That is good; because it needs it. Otherwise, the property is about the same (relatively high, but not highest) quality it's been since it was built 15-20 years ago. . . Pluses. + Large standard room (suite). + Large bathroom, good soaking tub. + Generally comfortable - good mattress, nice couch, sitting area, etc.. + Good, central, "Strip" location. . Minuses. - Dead linens (unforgivably bad). - Dark room, worn carpeting, aging decor. - Construction noise. - Interior room noise - poor soundproofing from the hallway - bad news in Vegas. . General Comments:. The hotel's "suites" (standard rooms) are large, as they always have been - comfortable for families or for more than one-two people. The property is well kept, apparently clean (rooms, grounds). No complaints there. . . Check-in line was long, but they were quick to address the issue, opening a second desk and sending people to redirect some of the line to the second desk. Good job there. . . The bathroom is large, spacious and keeps true to the Venetian theme with generous use of marble. It has a separate frameless / glass shower and soaking tub. There is a toilet room (which is very dark). The design is original, but it is classic enough that it is fine. . . The pool area is slightly boring, but nice, consistent with the "Venetian" theme.. . Re: the "unforgivably bad" linens, I will say a couple things, but start with this: even if the hotel is undergoing renovations, there is no excuse for old / dead linens & towels at a luxury property. . - The bedsheet we have is old, thin, scratchy and cheap feeling. . - The towels are old, light, and unworthy of a hotel at this level (wasting away from years of washing). My photo (attached) shows the first towel I grabbed this morning (outside the shower door), with extensive fraying and (more difficult to see) there was hard / melted plastic or metal on the towel. Whoever folded it would have seen it. I didn't until I took it off. Looks obviously dirty. Horrible, inexcusable.. . The linens wouldn't have passed at any Holiday Inn I stayed at in college, let alone a $200/night (or $400/wkd night) premium property in Las Vegas n 2014. . . I won't be back until the renovation is complete. And even then, I've much preferred recent stays at the Aria and Mandalay Bay. . . Room Tip: Ask for a renovated room. As of 7/29, they apparently have worked their way down to the 23rd floor...
