My husband and I ate here for both breakfast and lunch during our recent stay. Both meals were good, but we preferred lunch over breakfast. The lunch menu just seemed to have a bigger selection and offered desserts during that timeas well. All the usual buffet food choices were available for both meals, but nothing really "wowed" me. I guess I was expecting that wow factor coming from one of the most prestigious properties on the strip, but I've honestly had better buffets at a few other properties nearby. The food was fresh, good but not great, and I left satisfied. I guess that makes it A-OK?
VERY SAD ! first its damn near 40 $.  for the first thing they start dinner at 3.30 I got in line at 10 till the line moved 3.15 i'm at the register . i'm asking this will be my dinner tab not brunch . 4 people could not give me a straight answer. crab legs they know why we are there get in find out no crab legs till 3.45 . next , one king crab station 80 PEPPS IN LINE . TOOK 31 MIN. TO GET MY LEGS AND THEY WERE FROZEN.YOU HAVE TO RING  THE WATER OUT OF THE MEAT. GOT BACK TO MY TABLE IT TOOK SO LONG THAT THE WAITRESS CLEARED MY TABLE .AND SEATED SOMEONE ELSE .EVERYBODY WAS YELLING AT THE LADY MANAGER IN THE ORANGE JACKET SHE WAS NO HELP .the line was winding all the way through the other food stations nobody can serve themselves to the other fair . man ! what a joke nowhere near the quality of food like when steve wynn owned it .. the last time i'm going there .its now a over priced downtown buffet . GO SOMEWHERE ELSE !
I think this review has to be done section by section.... . Meats: 2 stars... They were definitely edible. And they had a wide range of selections, from lamb to kobe top round to prime rib to beef wellington... The beef wellington was well done and overcooked... it was almost gray. And the puff pastry on the outside was completely moist and un-flaky, probably from sitting under the heat lamp. The lamb was just okay, a bit gamey, but nothing too difficult to eat. The kobe top round wasn't anything special, other than the fact that it said "kobe" on the label. The prime rib wasn't terrible, but wasn't amazing.. . Potatoes: I love mashed potatoes, and the Bellagio didn't disappoint. The scalloped potatoes weren't good, though. Too cheesy and just too much.. . Asian foods: Honestly I didn't try any of the Asian food options. I think it's a waste of digestive real estate lol. I literally tried a tiny piece of the chicken tikka masala and it was pretty gross.. . Seafood: 3 stars... The ceviche was just okay. The shrimp cocktail was PERFECTION. The king crab legs were obviously thawed from being shipped frozen, but they were still pretty good.. . Sushi: 1 star... The rice was gross. The fish itself was fine, but sushi isn't complete without rice. The rolls were just mediocre, as expected from buffets.. . Caviar bar: 4 stars... The American caviar was good. The caviars were served on either a piece of bread or cracker with butter. The tobiko was yummy too. I didn't try the ikura (salmon roe), because it's a hit or miss even at sushi restaurants, and therefore probably a miss here. They also had spicy tuna hand rolls and steak tartares. The hand rolls were actually pretty good, but I personally think it could have used a slice of avocado and a slice of cucumber. The steak tartare was delicious.. . Charcuterie: 3 stars... They had these different cheeses. My favorite was the one that was laced with black. The green was weird, and the pink was like alcohol.. . Dessert: 5 stars... THIS was the best part of the entire buffet. The selection was vast, and mostly all of them were on point. They had sugar free options (not my thing) as well as gluten free options, for those who are intolerant. The desserts vary from creme brulee, flan, chocolate options, and strawberry desserts. I think my favorite thing was their Georgia peach sorbet. All of them are pretty much on point. Even the coffee they serve was dark and delicious, and complemented the sweet desserts perfectly.. . Drinks: The only thing I wish was that they had unlimited drinks included in the price, just like Studio B. . . Overall it comes down to 3 stars. It's not bad, but I wouldn't come back here. There are so many more options in Vegas!
Vegas buffets! When you go to Vegas you have to visit at least one. However, I was very disappointed by the Bellagio buffet. It is very very expensive and I didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth. Most of the food was just OK and the prime rib was dry and chewy. I guess I was expecting it to be better than the run of the mill buffets but it was just like any buffet with mass produced food sitting under heat lamps. For the price I would never go back.
The Bellagio buffet is a meer shadow of its former self. My wife and I were big fans before this weekend. If you want to try a good buffet do not go to the Bellagio for one. Honestly I'd rather have gone to Home Town Buffet then to have to sit through the Bellagio buffet. The service is nonexistent and the quality of the food has gone down the drain and into the refinement holding tanks. . . The only reason I can justify one star is because there is food there.
Good prime rib and king crab legs. Also have Kobe beef but I was sure it was not real Kobe. Very chewy. Other stuffs are just Ok. Desserts are a little disappointing. Overall, better to pay 37 here than 51 at Bacchanal buffet.
Of all the restaurants we ate at this week, the Buffet at Bellagio was the best for price, variety, and service.  The carving station with flank steak, ribs, turkey, and brisket was perfect.  Side dishes such as garlic asparagus, chilled shrimp, a variety of pasta, and spicy tuna hand rolls complemented lunch delightfully.
If I could write a sonnet about the pesto mashed potatoes I would. If God ate mashed potatoes, he would get them from the Bellagio Buffet, and that's a fact!. . Potatoes aside, the whole experience was pretty great once you got past standing in line for an hour (even when the wait time was only "twenty minutes"), and coughing up the $40 price (it's higher on weekends because there is a cavier bar - which is completely useless if you're a vegetarian. If you're going in there not touching the seafood, cavier, or Kobe steak, at least eat a shit ton of the deserts so you make it worth the money!). . . Once we were finally seated the service was AMAZING. Glasses were always filled, plates hastily cleared away, and the food was tres tres good!! I highly recommend. If for no other reason than the pesto mashed potatoes (I had a mere four helpings...).
Ugh, the food was disappointing and disgusting. The variety was lacking and the main food was bland. The desserts looked impressive but were such poor quality that it was all I could do to keep from spitting it out! My friend felt the same way. Save yourself the time in line and go to Jean Philippe Patisserie if you want to eat in the Bellagio.
Well the anticipation of a "great buffet" was for nothing. The food was meh  basically a typical resort buffet with a couple extra perks. Desserts, taco bar, and sushi we're good,  prime rib, smoked ribs , flank, and Kobe beef were chewy and hard. Crap legs were small, skimpy, and cold. Fifty bucks really. Service was excellent though. In short save your money and eat somewhere else
If you are going to splurge on a buffet in Vegas, make it a good one. The buffet at Bellagio just doesn't compare with all the other great buffets in Vegas. . . The food and variety was just okay. The little pancakes they were giving out with the caviar tasted awful. There are definitely other buffets that have better food quality for sure.. . From what I remember customer service was good. . . Overall, nothing really special from this place.
Went for lunch $20, great food, they have sushi, shrimp, sliders, desert, breakfast, the whole works. Can't beat the price and the quality. You will enjoy it!
not too bad, but to be frank, the buffet not meet my expectation. or the buffet in some hotel in china is much better? a little disappointed.
5 stars for holiday dinner selection and quality,  2 stars for dessert. . All of the attention these days seems to be on the newer buffets at Caesars, Aria and the Cosmo.  After a disappointing experience at the Cosmo, I was left wanting for more and decided to try an old classic.. . The holiday dinner buffet at the Bellagio was an exceptional display of Vegas extravagance.  While not much to look at in terms of decor, the endless meat/seafood selections made up for the poor ambiance.  King crab, caviar, shrimp, seabass, ahi poke, mussels, quality sushi, smoked salmon, lamb, brisket, ribs, beef wellington, prime rib, kobe beef roast, game hens, flank steak, short ribs.  The prime rib and the ribs fell flat, but the rest was very tasty - especially the lamb.  I love that they have all of the necessary condiments: mustard, mint jelly, au jus, horseradish, etc.... . I never eat pizza at a buffet - filler - but the pizza here is very good.  The truffle pizza and the beet/goat cheese were the best.  Some of the specialty salads here were good, but the other sides were just okay.  The big draws here are defiantly the carving stations and the seafood.. . Where everything starts to fall apart, is with the dessert.  Ugh.  Really bad 90s era soft-serve and super sweet cakes/cookies.  I just can't give it the full five stars until they upgrade that section.
I had two comp. tickets for this place for breakfast or lunch. We went towards the end of breakfast & so we were able to eat breakfast items AND lunch items. The chicken was so good. I thought it was going to be really dry but it was delicious.. . The workers were really nice & attentive. Except the asian lady that was outside doing the lines. She was so mean & rude. . . The food choices were pretty amazing & its spread out so that it isn't too overwhelming.
So much variety.  We went at 7 am on a Saturday and surprisingly we were able to enjoy breakfast and lunch! Lots to choose from however I didn't see many desserts.
Always serving up Alaska King Crab Legs for dinner.  If you like crab, make sure you hit this buffet.  We visit this buffet everytime we are in Vegas.  Food quality does vary somewhat and hence the four stars and not five stars rating.  On good days, the king crab legs, jumbo shrimp cocktails, caviar (served on certain nights only), prime rib, and desserts are all wonderful.  We like their Chinese Food section of the buffet but really do not like the sushi section.   The rice to the sushi never quite tastes right.  I guess we have been spoiled by good sushi places in our neck of the woods.  So if you are looking for a huge varitey of food with some good mean seafood, give this buffet a try!
What've you done or not done Bellagio?  You were the gold standard.  We should have asked for a refund.  Tough chewy meat, skinny crab, poor service. One star because of the desserts.
My kids and I came for lunch on a monday , line was not bad only a 15 minute wait .  we were disappointed with the food selection once inside, most of the items I saw in pictures were not being served on weekday lunch ,kids ended up just eating pizza  which was okay  and shrimp cocktail was very good, sushi was good , no crab legs though .slider burgers were too dried out to eat and all the bread was really dry and hard  noticed most of the dishes here are casseroles and none of them looked appetizing , not much Asian food and I did not get to try the meat section as there was a huge line there every time they would bring fresh chicken or beef,. desserts looked good but I was very disappointed that they all tasted bad even the eclairs were bad everything was either sickening sweet or sour , no gelato served here instead they have a ice cream station comparable to the one at sweet tomatoes.
We have been here twice now and neither were very good or worth the wait.  We've been her for dinner and now brunch, and let's just say, gross I've had better at hometown buffet.  The brunch had few selections and what was there was horrible and not fresh.  Will not come back to this buffet ever, much better buffets for same price or cheaper on the strip.
On our recent trip to Las Vegas, my wife and I ate at this buffet on two separate occasions.  Once for breakfast, and once for lunch.  I ate at this buffet years ago, and remembered it being better than it is now, at least for breakfast anyway.  We first went here for breakfast, and I must say that I was less than impressed with the selection.  It had your standard omelette station, along with other breakfast staples like bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, toast, etc.  The food was all pretty good, it just felt a bit underwhelming for being the "Bellagio" buffet.  This hotel has so much glitz and glamour associated with all of its other restaurants, I just felt the breakfast buffet was lacking a bit.. . When we went for lunch a couple days later, that was better.  They had many more options such as sliders, BBQ beef brisket, prime rib, etc.  Their dessert station was lacking, though.  They had a few selections of pie/cake that were ok, but they just have a standard ice cream machine like you might find at Ponderosa.  Other buffets such as the Wynn or Aria have a much better selection of desserts, in my opinion.. . Overall, this buffet is just A-Ok.  Not great, but not bad.  The price of breakfast here is around $20 per person, which I thought was reasonable for the Bellagio.  After eating here though, I see why the cost is what it is.  I have a feeling they will completely renovate their buffet before long.  Just a gut feeling.  Either way, it was decent, but I won't be rushing back here.
Mlife black cardholder + free points = No waiting in line, lots of people throwing shade at you.  Hah!. . Foodies rejoice, this buffet has it all.  From seafood to red meat and fancy little bites in between, how can you not love this place?  Probably one of the nicer buffets on The Strip, if not the nicest!  Service is pretty speedy since I'm sure they want you in and out of there ASAP.  Come for the crab legs, the lobster, the lamb, the prime rib, and don't forget dessert!  . . Bottomless mimosas on Saturday and $20 for a bottle of wine ain't too shabby.  Would I pay to come and eat here?  Maybe.  Bellagio is an extravagant place and they charge you for it for sure.  Will I enjoy it when it's free?  Of course!
The line is stupidly long on a Saturday morning. I went with someone with a gold m life card which let us cut the line. I thought the food was worth the price, especially for a ballagio location.
I was actually looking forward to eating at this buffet because of all the good reviews it get on yelp. We went on Sunday night for dinner around 7pm. We stood in line close to 2 hours which was horrible. The price was ok, it was $33 per person. Once we were seated and got a chance to eat, i was disappointed with the food.  Maybe it was because i was comparing it to the Bachnal buffet at the Caesars palace which is  AMAZING!  I really was expecting more from the buffet. The desserts were ok and the food was just ok. Nothing great. If it wasn't for the long line MAYBE i would have given it 3 stars.
Quality of this buffet was much better than most buffets we've been to and we've been to a lot.  They have a great assortment of meats,  fish, seafood, pasta,  salads,  sushi, poke,  and restaurant quality desserts.   Also be sure to ask for coffee afterwards.   it is super.  Will be coming back again!   :)
Great selection of food items at a fairly expensive price. But hey, you're at the Bellagio.
The food quality and service are much Lower than our expectation.. Too pricy for nothing.. I don't recommend this place.. They gave me the booth seat and it is very dirty also.. Don't waste your money.
If I had reviewed this buffet the first time we went, which was a few years ago, I would have easily given it 4 or even 5 stars . Still had happy memories of the panzanella salad, the tapenade on crostini, Kobe Beef Wellington, and Rosebud's crushing disappointment that the tray of chocolate macarons disappeared immediately and was never replaced, but was made up for with really exceptional little creme brulees. . . Sadly, none of these items were available this trip. I realize you takes your chances with  a buffet menu, especially when you wait so long between visits. (And speaking of waiting so long, the line was surprisingly lengthy for our mid-afternoon arrival, but I suppose we were not the only cheapos who figured on paying the lunch price just before they switched over to dinner. We were successful by a nose, and managed to save about $14 each. This eased the pain a little bit).. . They did have a little individual salad station; Caesar was ok but nothing special. Crab leg were served cold, which is fine by me, especially when I saw the eye roll another diner got when he asked the line cook to have his heated. Not one interesting item at the bread station - guess they want you to fill up on the expensive stuff, so we did.. . The prime rib was like butta, and the brisket was also pretty tasty. They were carving a large roast of what was labeled Wagyu beef. Now, I am of the understanding that this particular meat draws its signature tenderness from a pampered life of massage and  a high carb diet. I think the guy they carved up for this one had been sneaking off to the gym to work out at night. It didn't save his life, but he put up a great battle against my knife. . . They had a pretty decent variety of desserts, but not the macarons. At least. that's we thought at first. Turned out they had some they were "going to put out later". In other words: when the place was full of full-price dinner patrons. But, they did spring loose with them, but they were raspberry and therefore a disappointment. Also, they broke out some pretty tasty chicken masala when we were too full to enjoy it.. . So, it's pretty much like most buffets in that you can find more than enough items that you like to put you in physical distress, but it's not as good as it used to be.
This is one of the buffets I keep coming back to while in Vegas.  Brunch is just under $25, including tax, no tip. Restrooms are inside the buffet, which is nice.  You don't have to worry about exiting the buffet and not being able to come back in.  The line is long. Expect to show up when they open at 10 am and wait half an hour.  I got there at 11 and wasn't seated until 11:45. There are waiters who take drink orders.  I didn't see any soda fountains, like at Monte Carlo. . . I liked that had an omelet station, where you could also get fried eggs.  For brunch meats, they had buffalo brisket, turkey, rotisserie chicken, flank, and ribs. The ribs were good!  That's what I would go back for.  Seafood was a bit limited.  They had cocktail shrimp and filets, but no crab (probably because this is brunch).  There was a variety of deserts, including soft serve ice cream and sorbet.. . You definitely get your money's worth at this buffet - for the food as well as the service.
My group and I have come to this buffet a few times and I must admit it has quite a selection. Would it be dubbed the best buffet in Vegas? Probably not. However, it still had a great atmosphere and good food. The dessert is delicious and the food choices are acceptable. The price of what you pay also isn't terrible so it's good for what it gives you.
One of my favorite gourmet buffets in Vegas.  The lines for this buffet is proof itself that this is indeed a great buffet.  Make sure you present your Mlife card to get points.  This buffet is pricey esp in the weekends, but it is worth it.
Breakfast Monday-Friday 7AM-11AM $18.99. Lunch Monday-Friday 11AM-3:30PM $22.99. Dinner Sunday-Thursday 3:30PM-10PM $33.99. Gourmet Dinner Friday&Saturday 3:30PM-10PM $39.99. Brunch Saturday&Sunday 7AM-3:30PM $29.99 w/ champagne $41.98. Ages 3 and under are free. 18% gratuity is included for a party of 8 or more.. . As of July 26, 2014.. . My family and I are occasional visitors of Las Vegas resorts. Occasional as in, at least once every other year. Came this past week for an early birthday celebration for my dad. We stayed in Bellagio and dined at this buffet twice this trip. And there is always a line!. . So here is my TIP: Get a MLife card people! Once you reached past the beginners card, you can skip the long line at the buffets and go to the front. It probably saved us hours (no exaggeration). You also receive points on your card when you dine here (make sure you give it to them to slide).. . Weekday lunch review: Used the Mlife card to bypass the long line. Super crowded. I would come before 11AM since it would be considered breakfast time and stay for both. There is a omelette service station with crab legs, shrimps as options. Eggs Benedict, salads, pizza, cocktail shrimps, carbs (pasta, bread, bagels), desserts (same as dinner), ice cream, sushi (few options), soups.. . Weekday dinner review: Snow crab and king crab legs!! Prime rib (overcooked), ham (salty), rack of ribs (not bad), forgot what type of beef they had at the craving station but it was good, cockshrimps, pizza (why would you..), salad, 5 types of soups, dessert, ice cream machine, sushi, fruits, pasta, lots of fish, tuna and salmon poki. I had a food baby that night. As I recall from trips before, the Wicked Spoon had better options for desserts. Dessert isn't the best here nor special. Overall it's a good buffet though.
One of the best buffets on the strip. Most people go for their king crab legs. Great dessert variety. You'll find many things you'll love there; I'd list them all but there are far to many. If you are a VIP card holder, there isn't a line. If you are a guest at the Bellagio, then you have a different shorter line than the general public. This is one of the only buffets I go to on all of my trips to Vegas. Some people dress up to go here, but not necessary.
It's not worth the price if you're going for the crab, (snow or king).  You'll be disappointed in the quality.  I know crab, and I've had worse, but I expected better.   I rated it a 4 only because of the desert selection, which was very good.
We went here after eating at the rio buffet for several years in a row on our other trips. Our friends had gotten married and everyone went after. We were late and after catching up on some sleep made it over.. It was a weekend so it was like $10 more.. Never again. It may have been all the "gourmet" food but no thank you!! I'm easy, good quality sea food (hot or warm crab legs not cold or iced) and traditional buffet foods. This was not. It was all very good quality but to damn fancy for me. I tried caviar for the first and last time.. Three different kinds. I'm sure that may have been worth the $39 we paid per person but as for me it was way way over priced.. . The desert section was awesome! Gotta love bananas foster!
Update from my last trip in May 2014. They had the hamburger slider bar I adore so much! Yay! Sadly, at least during lunch on weekdays, there were no crab legs. Just shrimp. Boo. In their defense, though, it seemed like most of the strip buffets we went to for lunch were no longer doing crab legs. Maybe there is a shortage? Maybe it is just a dinner thing now?. . Also I had the turkey at the carving station and this time it was cooked gorgeously. That with the mashed potatoes, gravy and cranberries was like Thanksgiving in May. Yum yummy.. . I would enjoy a bit more selection in the sushi roll department and I am still missing the caprese salad at the salad bar but everything I had this trip was delicious. However, I recommended the pesto shrimp pizza to my friend and when we went to go get her a slice they had just put out a whole one right from the oven...and it was incredibly undercooked. The crust wasn't even slightly brown so she skipped it.. . Don't lose your focus, Bellagio! You have the ability to be one of the best buffets on the strip but you have to really keep your eye on quality!
I came here for breakfast. Yes the buffet was good and there was plenty of food to go around. There was not however, anything that stood out for me. . . As a side note, if you want to sit at the bar, go ahead and go through the exit where, if there is room, you will be seated right away. The bartenders were quite friendly and helpful.
I'm pretty picky when it comes to buffets. Quantity doesn't overpower quality...I've been to every buffet at the major hotels and all I can say is WOW WOW WOW. Bellagio's is by far the best! I've come many times to this buffet: we went again last night and it was simply fantastic.. . The service here is excellent: doesn't matter whether you're dealing with a server, hostess or the people in the charge, they always make you feel like Royalty. We were seated quickly, given the table of our choice and our server was really great. he checked on us often and we didn't have to want for anything.. . Now the food, OHHHH the food....this restaurant has by far the best selection. They have everything from comfort food to International to Kobe beef, friggin delicious pesto mash potatoes, curries, sushi, mac n cheese, chinese dishes, pizza that blows the local joints out of the water, and AMAAAZING desserts!! Their cheesecake and pecan pies are worth every calorie. Every dessert was great.. . I've been here many times and there isn't one item isn't that I tried that isn't delicious...we ate a ton and left feeling very, very satisfied.. . One other thing I've noticed: the food here is made with really good quality oils and ingredients: even though we always eat a lot, we always feel light in an hour or so. There's never heartburn, indigestion or anything like that. Great, great quality.. . This restaurant is by far superior to the other buffets at the hotels...and surprisingly, more reasonably priced! If you come to Vegas, you HAVE to try this buffet...they are by far the best one.
