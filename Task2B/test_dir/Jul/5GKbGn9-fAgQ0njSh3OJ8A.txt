who cares about anything else? just get the meatball. . . . Pizza was pretty good as well.
Very disappointed in Lavo Las Vegas. I had eaten at the one in NYC and it was good. But this one in Vegas was a terrible experience. I had taken 8 clients there for dinner and no one liked their food. The meatball app was the only thing decent to eat. I ordered their chicken dish and it was so dry I had to chase it down with water to even swallow it. My wife ordered the Pena Ala Vodka and it was dry wife no sauce. Like it had been under a heat lamp for hours. Bottom line: Over rated. Dry food. Simply blows!
Tell the chef to balance the size of the dishes. The best part of my meal was the bread.
Our server was fantastic, although his name escapes me at the moment (tall, very short hair). I complimented the manager on the entire experience. At fancier restaurants, I tend to notice that my boyfriend and I (both in our early-mid twenty's) do not get the same attention as the group of businessmen that are sitting at the table two down from us. I understand the stereotype, especially because younger people usually can't afford to eat out at places of this one's stature. However, this was definitely not the case here. . . Our server greeted us right away and offered us cocktails, although we both only ordered water. He walked us through the menu, giving suggestions, explaining the food & specialty items and answering my  myriad of questions with patience and a smile.. . We started with the Tuna Tartare Appetizer, which was out of this world. The tuna was fresh and the sauce complimented it perfectly. . . I had the minestrone soup after that, which was also good,but nothing extraordinary.. . For dinner, I had the rock shrimp lemon zest risotto. And WOW, my mouth still waters just thinking about it.. . My boyfriend had the Bone in Filet. The flavor was unmatched. I've been to many a fancy steakhouses, but this was the best bone in filet I'd ever had. Although it came out EXACTLY as our server described it, there was no irritation when my boyfriend asked for it to be cooked a little bit more before we packed it to go.. . Overall, everything was wonderful. I wish I didn't live quite so far away, or this would quickly become a weekly favorite.
Ugh. As if i havent sung this place enough praises, here I am writing another review for it. So, second time in Vegas for 4th of july vaca. Brought a new group of girls to indulge with me and everything was just as delicious as I last left it. From the time they bring you the garlic bread and marinara, just lean back and unbuckle your belt/corsets to make room, cause everything is so effing delicious. Apparently I fell into a trance and started licking the sauce off the table with my fingers. Wow. Moving on, I had my chilean seabass with a side of mushrooms, it was perfection as usual. Others ordered a risotto, a seafood Alfredo, rave reviews on the texture and freshness for both, a marinara pizza, long classic flavorful, a lobster bisque, not my fave, they make theirs taste too gingery I find, but it does have big delish chunks of lobster. But let me bring it back because the MVP of our dinner was the calamari. Again, wow, simples done right, nice and crisp tight batter and the meaty perfectly sized hoops, again dunking into that heavenly marinara. Once again, I haven't made it as far as desert cause we're always so stuffed before entrees even come, portions are huge, plus the drinks are great, we always enjoygummi bear shots, and sparkling selections. Ugh, just so much winning to do here. Service was kind and prompt as usual, last hear we had a really cool brunette guy who comped us some shots, this time we had a lady with a short blunt cut bob, she was very nice and cautious of bringing everything quickly for us, knowing that we had to go somewhere after, and she even comped a dish for a girl who felt the pasta in her alfredo was a little too hard, and brought out a recooked version out of courtesy. Thats good service in my book, treat your customers like you truly want them to enjoy their food and experience at all costs, and that keeps us coming back. Also, I have another Lavo location here in NY that I've dined at before to get a fix for my favorites, but its just nowhere near as delish. They cook with extra love at this Vegas location, totally worth flying out 5 hours for! Sidenote, I'm disappointed to see they closed their nightclub part. Had really good times there last year (retroactive shoutouts to the chocolate cutie who used to work there named Noah ;-) Now they just have a cocktail/hookah lounge, that was actually closed on the Sunday we went so place was pretty quiet and chill. Its all good, we had limos and bottles waiting elsewhere to turn up, this dinner was still worth all of our attention!
I have been to Lavo before and was excited about it again.  I made reservations for several of my colleagues (C level) and the CEO of our company for a Wednesday at 8pm.  I made these reservations through Lavo's website via OpenTable and confirmed with a credit card.  We arrived promptly at 8pm and were told our table was not ready.  After waiting 30 minutes, our CEO asked the young ladies why we could not be seated and they both just shrugged.  Fifteen minutes later we still had no answers as to why we had been waiting 45 minutes for a table booked almost a month prior. The hostesses were completely unconcerned. I'm sure Lavo has the same food it did last time, however the incompetence level of the staff and manager are inexcusable.  Only make a reservation here if you are interested in scrambling to find another dinner spot when they cannot accommodate you.  If they cannot learn to hold a table reservation, then they need to stop taking reservations.
What a nice little surprise. I probably would have never picked this place to go eat but was out on a bachelorette party and ended up going with the ladies. . . It is a fun atmosphere and they have great cocktails in pitchers!! WOO HOO PITCHERS!! The one we ordered tasted like candy! . . Shared a bunch of appetizers and pizzas. They start you off with some amazing garlic bread. We followed it with the giant meatball (it really is giant) . Some Calamari which was good though I am not a huge fan of Calamari. . . Next was the beet salad and the Ceaser salad, both were crisp and fresh. We followed this off with 3 pizzas. It was too much food for 7 girls and we had some pizza left over. All three pizzas we tried were yummy and packed with flavors. . . Overall it was very reasonably priced as well. The manager came by, congratulated the bride to be and made us a round of shots. Great service, great experience I will definitely be back next time I am in Vegas.
Amazing as always. For those who complain about reservations and getting pagers, they can't control when people sit there talking for hours after they're done eating. The experience is worth the 10 minute wait. On a Friday night at 9:30pm, we were seated in 2 minutes. . . The restaurant has a live dj, and the atmosphere is a little loud. There was an older couple next to us who really didn't like the music (typical dance music with some 90s remixes), but there was a few bachelorette parties who seemed to enjoy it. . . Their signature drinks are amazing (try the white tiger) or call your own. The bartenders are friendly and have a heavy hand if you put your phone down and talk to them. . . Food. Beef carpaccio is worth every penny if you're into the raw stuff. After trying it at dozens of restaurants in Vegas, I can say hands down, this is the best. The pizzas are to die for, and the spinach and artichoke is no exception. Spaghetti and meatballs is great to if you want pasta, and the steaks are just as great if you're craving meat. I'm not a seafood person but people I've gone with, rave about the fish as well. The (free) garlic bread they bring you, will fill you up as well because you can't stop eating it. . . When you're done, try the Oreo zeppole and hope you've saved room. They're battered and deep fried and come out very soft. The other desserts are good, but this one is the best - ask your server, it's the most popular. . . Needless to say, I will keep coming back.
