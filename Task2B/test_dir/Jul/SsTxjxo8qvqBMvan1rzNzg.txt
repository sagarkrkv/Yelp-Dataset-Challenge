Really disappointed after reading rec in USA Today and having locals endorse it. Read others' reviews about juicy burgers; ours were dry but still a bit cold in middle.  I had the pesto burger; everything but the meat was good. My husband's mushroom burger was also dry. Our fries and rings were unremarkable, and it wasn't as inexpensive as I expected. Cool to see inside.
Always solid good old school Vegas.milkshakes are some of the best in town
Great find everything else was closed so we decided to do a littler forth of July dinner  great service by Alfonso
Good food and customer service! Come hungry as the portions are huge! The restaurant had that old Vegas feel,
We loved this restaurant.  First of all colored sugar at the table!  Woo-hoo!  The kids loved it....okay, so did the parents. The decor inside with the neon lights were very cool too.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive; the cocktail waitress was also wonderful.  A photographer came by to take a complimentary photo of the family.  We received a free 3x5 photo and had the option to buy 8x10, but didn't.  The free one was perfect!  The food was pretty good and we were very pleased.  The portion size was pretty huge, so we were able to take it back to our hotel.. . Great place!
Great food with awesome service.  Very accommodating to us even when we're in a hurry and made some complicated orders.  The breakfast was all we had and it was so delicious.  It catered to my fitness diet and we can count on them for that. The great thing about this place, it's next door to our host hotel when we have to work all weekend. By the way, the lounge is a chill place to wait to be seated.
I've eaten at the Peppermill a number of times over the last 5 or 6 years. I usually arrive into Vegas on a later, after-work flight from the East coast. By the time I get checked in to my hotel and all cleaned up for the evening, many of the hotel dining options are closed or things are winding down. Thankfully, the Peppermill is open 24 hours with a full menu. It is a fantastic diner with a great menu, and soo much character. It's clean, the wait staff is friendly and top notch. Also, the late-night manager is friendly, always on her toes, and interested in hearing about the customer experience. She does a great job both supporting and orchestrating the service staff. . . I have ordered many entrees, both dinner and breakfast selections, some of which include the following:  Berry Spinach Salad, Crab Cakes, Omelettes, Chicken and Red Pepper Pasta, Swiss and Mushroom Burger, Creamy Chicken Dijon, Pesto Chicken Sandwich, Tomato Bisque, Chicken Noodle Soup. My favorite is the Creamy Chicken Dijon dinner. Two generous pieces of pounded chicken served on top of mashed potatoes with a vegetable, often green beans, and of course the creamy dijon sauce.  It is a large portion entree, as most of the dishes served are. I'm surprised there are not pictures of this entree in the photos section. The specialty drinks are excellent too. Cocktail waitresses in black gowns take your drink order which is prepared by the bartenders in the Fireside Lounge. I've ordered the Blue Hawaii a couple of times, and I have a friend that loves the Espresso Martini.. . After dinner, I usually get a couple of drinks in the Fireside Lounge. You get certain drinks comp'd if you play the video casino games at the bar. However, I have to warn you, the games seem tighter than many of the machines I've played at different locations in Vegas. You may want to consider abstaining from play and just pay outright for your drinks. All in all, the lounge is a comfortable place to get a few drinks with friends after dinner.. . I gave this restaurant a very high rating, taking into consideration it is an upscale diner, with its own unique signature ambiance.
Perfect diner for a late night snack. Great huge portions right on the Strip. Saw one guy eat a chicken fried mozzarella steak hero sandwich with onion rings tooth picked into the top. Five minutes into it, his eyeballs turned white with 3 sevens across them. He fell out of the booth and yelled, "I just paid off!" That's a late night Vegas diner, baby.
Did not go to the Peppermill restaurant this time, but just to the Fireside for drinks. . I love both sides of this place, but the Fireside has such an amazing atmosphere. . Of course there is a beautiful fireplace that has seats and TVs playing videos surrounding the fire pit. I also enjoy the music it plays...it's a mix of everything from newer top 40s to 80s music. . The other seating in the lounge is very intimate and comfortable. . We got the Fireside speciality drink which was 64oz with 6 shots in it. You can get it blended with ice cream, but we just got it on the rocks.  Happy to have done it once, and it was good, but probably wouldn't order again, as I am more of a beer and whiskey gal. . The waitress was very friendly and attentive. . I would definitely return here again and again. . Great place to take your visiting tourists too!
You know what. There's really only one way to describe this place.. . "Upper class Denny's, good looking servers, and humungous portions". . Seriously that is all that you need to know. The food portions here are so big that there is no way you cannot get full. You thought Denny's was good? Denny's can't even touch this. I'm not saying that it's the MOST delicious breakfast food I've eaten. What I am saying is that they will fill you until your gut explodes.. . Oh one more thing. If you are hung over, go here for breakfast. Yup.
Blah ... it is a Denny's with even bigger portions. Meaning you pay $13 for a pancake and you get a really big pancake. The food in general is no better than any other fast casual breakfast place just bigger portions. Our server, Cheyanne, we think forgot our order because when she started serving people around us, who sat down 45 minutes after our party of 6, she said the delay was "making a grilled cheese". Funny, the grilled cheese came out first! She also brought toast to one diner 30 minutes before their eggs arrived. When they asked for "hot toast" for their meal she seemed a little put out. BUT, the Peppermill is an establishment and part of the Vegas experience. Just don't think you are going to get anything special except for your Bloody Mary served by a woman in an evening gown.
This is seriously one of those places that you just have to visit when you're in Vegas. The food is normally priced, the portions are enormous, and the decor is right out of my neon fantasies. . . Get the banana bread & take that back to your hotel for a snack later in the day. You'll be happy you did.
If you want to eat at a Denny's type establishment go to Denny's. It's much better than Peppermill! However, if you like dining with a lamp hanging in your face, this place fits the bill. It's unfortunate, because the decor and neon lights are cool. In the end, we felt like we were in a bad episode of Charlie's Angels. The food was very sub par. I ordered the "signature" burger, and found it dry and flavorless. My wife's turkey burger was unseasoned, bland, and tasted like charcoal. The sweet potato fries were limp, and tasted like they had been sitting in a pool of grease. You can't order drinks from your server, so you have to track down the cocktail waitress. We tried the Scorpion, which supposedly had six shots. It was basically a bowl of ice and fruit juice. There was also a guy going around offering to take a complimentary picture. It reminded me of the guy who would make balloon animals at Carlos Murphy's back in the 80s. The free picture was 3x5. He was harassing a family of Scandinavian tourists trying to get them to buy an 8x10 saying that this was the best deal they would find on the Strip. Overall my stomach felt like rocks the rest of the night. Thanks Peppermill for providing memories we will never forget!
This old restaurant is still alive and kicking. You want a big and filling meal for your money's worth, go here! Every time I go to Vegas I stop by here at least once during my trip. This restaurant is open 24 hours and has great food. They also have a lounge in the back which is good size, nice fire pit in the middle of a small water fountain, some pretty hostesses, and decent price drinks. The menu is your typical American food you can find at Dennys, Norms, Spires, etc. But the quality at Peppermill far surpasses those places. I would recommend this place to everyone going to Vegas!
"Fireside Lounge". . I absolutely love this place and no visit to Vegas is complete without it. Obviously, I can't give it higher than three stars because it's so cheesy, but I still love it. You enter through a standard diner (with pretty good cholesterol-heavy food) into a pink-and-blue-neon low-ceilinged room with a fire pit in the center. It's like passing from "Alice" into "Fantasy Island" to complete the '80s feel. I will give them points for the place always seeming very clean even though it's cluttered and hasn't been updated in an age (which is sort of the point). The plastic flower garland hanging everywhere isn't dusty and the cocktail servers in long black skirts slit up to the ying-yang are busy polishing the brass railings and plumping the cushions when not bringing drinks. The drinks aren't very good and tend to the sweet side on the cocktail menu. Hilariously, when I was last there, my buddy ordered a gin & tonic and the waitress asked, "Would you like olives with that?" He was a bit taken aback, but said, "No, typically it comes with a twist. Gin and tonic, right?" The waitress acknowledged the order and when she went to the bar, he turned to me and said, "I will bet you money I'm about to get a gin martini." Sure enough, he got a giant glass of gin with a twist of lemon it in. Thus was born the new drink, a Gin & Tonic-Hold the Tonic. This was a pretty basic fail, but it only makes you love the place more. It's kind of like your slightly mentally-challenged child--you can't help but have affection despite its issues.. . Sour note: Since smoking is allowed, when there are various trolls puffing away at the bar, the low ceilings can make the smoke pretty oppressive.
Food was amazing! Well worth the wait and the portions were generous. Hopefully it doesn't take me 12 more years to return!
The food is amazing... I Went there with a few friends, and I just fell in love with this place.
Hadn't been in a long while. Still as nice as always, my husband and I stopped in for one drink while out and about the other night. Love the cocktail servers dresses!
Excellent service. Great vibe for a Vegas restaurant. . . Good was really good and onion rings were crispy and delicious. . . Feels like an old Big Boy restaurant but mite lively and Vegas like. . . Recommended!!
This a must-visit place each time I am in Vegas...I heard this is one of the places locals frequent...Why stay in your hotel for breakfast?  You would get a great diner experience here!
it is always nice to visit the peppermill, especially after a night of heavy drinking :)  the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because our waitress was kinda of a bi**h.  she had attitude, she would slide stuff across the table, she didnt bring us any condiments.  The bus boy had to get our sodas and our syrup.  the sampler platter was good it came with chicken strips, mozarella sticks, bruchetta, fried shrimp, and onion rings. All the food was pretty good, its just the service they have to work on
The food was awsome drunk, but the service was spectacular by Alice at fireside lounge. Why is she there, our waitress should be at a five star restaurant.
This place is a brisk 15 minute walk (in the sweltering heat) from the Trump Int'l Hotel. Just go to the strip and then walk north. I miss my local Peppermill that was in Cupertino (right by Apple), so it's always a bit nostalgic to come in and see. . . The place is just a snazzy, super Vegas diner, with quick service. There was a bit of a wait, but you can go into the lounge for a cocktail while you'r waiting for a table. I had a mimosa, and my friend had a very awesome Bloody Mary. Nice 'n spicy.. . I had the corned beef hash. It was good. The portion was ginormous. I had it for an early morning snack the next morning (thank goodness for the kitchenettes in the Trump!). . All the details of this place are super fun. There's colored sugar in the sugar dispenser. There's fun neon. There's fake trees. What more can you ask for when in Vegas?
I have been to the Peppermill a few times but never eaten here. Normally I go with friends and watch them drink while I have tea or soft drink in the fireside area. Which is a great place for a couple (you will be pleasantly surprised I Promise). We were there to eat and eat we did. The waitress was nice and looked 16 which I kidded her about but she was a good sport and a very good server. I found it to be a good time and I loved the pastrami sandwich (so lean) just writing this review makes me want to go back. I have not had a good pastrami sandwich in a while. The servings were healthy and everything was quite good. I will be going back. Who wants to come?
The first brunch place we have found out in Vegas and we both loved it. The Turkish sausage with three eggs and hashed potatoes as well as the halfed banana were what we have ordered. The size was so huge that eventually we end up with sharing and could not finish the icecream. Waitress was very attentive.
The lounge is a must see. Food is huge portions but really good. Did i say visit there lounge..i love it. Drinks are enormous and sooo good!!
I think this is a place to go late at night / early in the morning hours. We were there for dinner, and nobody really liked what they had. The gyro sandwiches were just ok. The bruschetta wasn't very good. The garlic bread for it wasn't v. garlicky, and it was cold. The spinach salad was old spinach leaves, and tasteless bacon bits. We were there for an early dinner. I know we disappointed the cocktail waitress because we didn't order.
Great location. Great Food. Great Price!!. If you're tired of paying 80 bucks on the strip for lunch, check out this place. . Service is quick, portions are MASSIVE and prices are extremely reasonable. Been coming here for a few years now and have had a variety of items on their menu and it's always been delicious. Give it a try.
The food was yummy, the location was rather interesting, the staff was okay, but the wait was awful.. . The outside makes it look like a classic diner. However once inside you'll see its true appeal. It literally looked like a strip club but was missing the most essential aspect of it, a pole! That could've, would've been nice! . . The front end was nice and did a great job dealing with all the hangry (hungry and angry) people. However, the service was a bit off once we were seated. It took a while for our waitress to make her way to us which is understandable given that they were swamped but we had been waiting for 50+ minutes and could've used a refreshment right off the bat.. . Our orders came out all together which was nice; none of that awkward waiting and watching for others to get their plates. I got the Eggs Benedict which was pretty good and priced at at about $13. I liked how the hollandaise sauce tasted. It was a bit tangier than others I've had in the past.  The eggs were poached nicely and ran lovely through my crispy hashbrowns. My friends tried numerous things such as the club sandwich, the BLAT sandwich, and an omelette all of which was pleasing.  . . Overall, definitely not a bad option if you're in Vegas and want something yummy andfun for breakfast. However, if there's a long wait I wouldn't bother. I personally, didn't think it was worth the 50+ minutes we waited to just get seated. I did think the lounge was a fun place and wouldn't mind stopping by there for a pregame drink.
This is an absolute MUST if you have people visiting Vegas! Heck, I'd come here all by my lonesome just for the cheeky eclectic lighting and huge portions! . . Peppermill is quintessentially Las Vegas :) It's open 24 hrs, and seemingly always packed.  Located on the north end of the strip, it's not the greatest location, but convenient enough and with ample parking. They make a mean sandwich, and supposedly have amazing banana bread! The service can be a little slow, but it was friendly none the less. What I love about this place, however, is all the neon lights and it's 50's diner quirk. There is also a bar attached that has a nice little indoor fire-pit that is soooo retro fun. It gets crowded so be ready for a wait or to sit at the counter.
This place is definitely unique. I haven't been here in a few years and I'm glad that I decided to re-visit today. . . The diner itself is different from your ordinary food spots.  It has great lights on the inside and I get that old diner vibe with the staff wearing their uniforms.. . The food is great and comes in HUGE proportions.  I ordered breakfast and recieved enough food for the entire day. . . The staff are all extremely good looking which doesn't hurt either! . . Overall it was great :)
Me and my friend came here for some late night eating and I got to say, worst sandwich I've ever had in my life. we got the mozzarella with tomato sandwich. It was just what you read. Cold ass tomato and cold ass mozzarella. Not grilled or even warmed up or anything. I forced myself to eat half before I was sure I was going to vomit.. The only great thing about this place is the colorful sugar I kept snacking on through the whole visit, and their gigantic ice cream sundae. Now that is what dreams are made of.
This place is so tacky, it's not even funny.  Upon entering, you feel like the SS Enterprise teleported you back to 1980.  I want to brae out my shoulder pads, aqua net, parachute pants and Members Only jacket.  The ceilings are mirrored, with neon pink, and blue lights everywhere.  There are these giant fake cherry blossom trees, and planter after planter of fake plants and flowers.  Just think, the cheesiest place imaginable. . . You may come here to be entertained by the cheesy atmosphere, but you definitely come here for the amazing food.  The portions are enormous! Definitely big enough for two to split.  We got one garden omelette, a fruit cup, and an order of eggs Benedict to share for three people.  It was more than enough food.  . . While the food and the service were both excellent, the only bummer of this visit was the 30 plus minute ticket time to get our food.  The server repeatedly apologized, and was kind enough to not charge us for our coffee, iced tea and oj.  This is the minus one star.  Otherwise this place rocks!
Maybe my standards are just too high, as when I go into a restaurant & order simple food I expect to get simple food. Nothing extra & disgusting. This place is a must if you like things in your food, like used sweetener packets from what I assume was a dirty plate. The manager attempted to say sorry but just made it worst. Although our server lacked the experience to rectify the problem, she tried to take care of it. They get one star and not a negative five because our server, Cheyenne, was a trooper, she tried to stay positive & smiley. The manager, only after reading my horrible comment card, came back over & tried to attempt to actually hear us the second go round. Whatever won't be back!!! I'd rather cook & btw I hate cooking!!!
I LOVE YOU PEPPERMILL. . Once again you made me so happy to be in Vegas. Had an early AM flight and probably couldn't check in and decided to grab some breakfast.. I got the 2 eggs and turkey sausage. Scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly and it came with 4 Turkey Sausage patties. I also had them melt shredded cheddar cheese on top of the hash browns. As the side I got the blueberry muffin...it was the most amazing muffin I've ever had. They also have whipped butter, so it didn't tear the muffin or toast if you got that. My friend got the corn beef hash. She really liked it. It was a GIANT portion. It comes with basted eggs, which means sunny side up and then finished under the salamander. Its still runny though.. . The cocktail girls now wear black satin dresses instead of the awesome velvet ones.
