Unique food that packs a punch! I just wish for the price I could end up a little more full.
Wow!   My husband and I usually wander around the restaurants in our area spending good money and getting bland boring food.   Sadly we have grown accustomed to it.   But not here!  The food is great and the atmosphere is alive and vibrant.   We both started with soups, I had the mushroom and my husband had the red pepper.  They are both served with fresh bread and butter.   The soups were fantastic and a great value - honestly.   Our son had a pasty and curried potatoes.  A little on the salty side for my taste but the flavors were definitely there.   My husband and I shared a sausage salad and it was filled with veggies, cheeses and meat and very satisfying.  Loved the choices of beers and fresh iced teas as well.  We will be back.!
Awesome dinner at Cornish Pasty tonight! I had the Bangers and Mash Pasty and Hubby had the Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty. Had the hot baked beans on the side. Everything was delish. Amazing pastry. We really wanted to do the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert but were too stuffed.. . Nice layout with plenty of both outdoor and indoor seating. We chose indoor since it was 105 outside. Very friendly service too.. . We will definitely be back next time we are in the area.
I don't understand all the fuss about this place. The restaurant itself is crowded, dark, and dirty. I should mention that I am a vegetarian, and they have several veggie pasty options on the menu but I find them to be heavy and kind of bland. Perhaps this is a better place for meat-lovers. One positive thing that I will say is that it is fun to sit by the kitchen and watch how they make their famous pasty.
Great Food...best Greek Salad!!  A little small gets crowded fast. Prices  Good !  love the New one in old town Scottsdale
So good. Just try it, you'll understand. From what I've tried, the Cream Of Leek Soup is the best item on the menu.
Even things that sound like they won't be good - actually turn out to be great. The food is uncommonly good. . . THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS PLACE IS: the waiters have no uniform and they all dress like hipsters. You can't tell who is bringing your drinks and who is just a bassist in an alt-rock band.
Upon arriving, I thought this place was shut down. Windows were black, no eye-catching sign, etc. Come to find out, it's open, and all that adds to the ambiance of the place. I didn't care too much for the dark pub eating experience, though. . . As for the food, I ordered two  pasties and a desert. I liked the the pasty crust, but the fillings lacked flavor to me. The dessert was the best part! Good ole' Apple caramel pasty with ice cream! . . At least I can say I've tried a Cornish Pasty!
Absolutely Yummy! I have convinced non-experimental eaters to even try this place.  They are convinced this is pretty dang good too!  My husband and I usually get a couple pasties to go and because we can never decide which is best, we usually end up trading off half way through.  The only downside to this place is that there is no delivery!  I would place orders here for lunch more often if there was!
Atmosphere . Food . Stone Beer
Well, I can say I finally say I've eaten at the highly regarded Cornish Pasty.. . On the interesting scale, I'd give it a 5. The dark, pub-meets-art-museum (complete with church pews for seats) look of the inside is kind of neat. The servers, completely stereotypical hipster in appearance, all seem nice enough. The menu and food are very different than anything I've seen before.  We ended up ordering the Meat and Cheese pasty and the Mexican. Both were good, and came with the appropriate sauces.. . If I have one complaint, it's that pasties are pre-made. So if you don't like a certain ingredient or are allergic to something, there's no ordering the pasty of choice without it; you'll just have to find something without it in it. It also makes me wonder how long some of the less popular pasties have to sit and wait to be ordered.
Chicken pot pie- was kinda garlicky, like raw garlicky, awesome chunks of white meat. Comforting. . Chicken tikka masala- holy cow. White folk made this? High five! You nailed it! Think chicken tikka masala samosa!
It's hard to pass up a really fancy hot-pocket. Especially when the stuffing is anywhere from pesto chicken to the royal with cheese to traditional European eats like shepherd's pie to veggie and vegan options. All warm and delicious and folded into a flakey crust. Yum. . . The staff has always been friendly and helpful when torn between two different pasty. They're knowledgeable about the menu and the beer selection. The ambiance is pretty chill and dark inside. A great place to go with a lover or friend. Or family haha.. . Do what you like, but if you're in the area I highly recommend you get your booty over to Cornish Pasty and eat some of this tasty goodness.
The original hot pocket, a pasty is IMO a better version of the other tries (calzone, empanada, etc...). The meat and Cheese, Lamb vindaloo, lamb and mint...OK, all of them are good!!. Oh, and beer on tap, the only thing they have too much of on tap is hipsters....seriously, skinny jeans, plaid shirts, a beanie and beard in 110 degree heat screams retarded, not cool.
Dim and a bit moody when you walk in, but nice and cozy the minute you finally take a seat.. To put it simply , this place serves comfort food at it's finest. The assortment of meat pies is phenomenal. Although you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu, my personal favorite is the Cajun. Between the flakey, moist, buttery crust and the spicy chicken, it is definitely a fine creation. Come check it out. You won't be disappointed
Great food and beer selection.  Soups are also phenomenal.  Had a great dinner experience.. . Unfortunately, I parked in the back lot and someone keyed the SHIT out of my car.  It had problems before but someone went to town on it.  I work in the area...didn't think it was that bad.  But I'll never go back after dark.
I love this place. Fairly inexpensive, lovely atmosphere, large portions....my favorite is the cajun chicken...yum-O!!!!
I had chicken tikka masala. It's awesome. And chicken Asiago is damn tasty. I liked this place and I am going to be here again and again
I like this place for mainly the beers and atmosphere.  The original one in Tempe is the best, of course, but the others are pretty cool.  The food?  Well, I'm not the biggest fan of British inspired food but it has a very home cooked feel to it.  If you like calzones and such, you'd like pastys.  So far I've had the meat and cheese one, and the curry one.  Will make it back to try more.
Every time I go in I find something new that is my favorite. This time it was the bread and butter..unghhh. Must get every visit, now. Also the broccoli/cauliflower bake is a must get. Any pasty you choose will be a winner. Guaranteed.
Delicious food,good music, cool place. I may stop back in the next time I'm in Phoenix :)
I am in love with this place. As I sat and waited for a friend at the bar earlier, I read about the pasty's history and sampled some of their yummy beers on tap. This was my second time there, and each time I visit, I get to enjoy a tasty pasty and awesome beer on tap. Tonight I had the traditional pasty and a yummy Nitro Porter.
So I'm sure they're tired of being compared to Hot Pockets, but the best explanation I can come up with is gourmet hot pockets at their best. The food is absolutely killer here; I've tried four of the pasty's (pronounced liked nasty with a "p" not like tasty with a "p"-well at least that's what I've gathered from listening to the staff) and they've all been amazing. The best part is it isn't only the traditional meat cheese and potatoes. The options are all over the place and you can even bring your vegan friends. You can get a beer from the other side of the pond and the ambiance definitely feels like a good pub from across the Atlantic. . The only reason they aren't getting five stars is because my most recent visit; the bartender eating his dinner at the bar was clearly more important than my dinner. It's ok; it's not like with a hot meal I'd like to chase it down with a beverage of sort. The kitchen guys have always been extremely helpful and I appreciate them. The food is amazing enough and diverse enough to where I'll be back frequently, just hopefully not during my bartender's dinner time.
Great, unique food and a nice selection of beers.  There isn't much more I'd ask from a restaurant.  The ambiance is very casual and dark but it's a great place for a large group or even solo dining.  The menu is fantastic and makes you want to come back again just to try another pasty.  With a dough wrapped meat/cheese/veggie mix you'd think this would be very heavy but it isn't.  They don't overload with fats or cheeses so the meal remains balanced and tasty.  Happy hour M-Sat until 6 just adds another reason to stop by.
Oh my this is good food - like the different treatments for wings and of course the Pasties...
I must be the one person who doesn't "get" this place.. Maybe I don't like British food? Maybe I don't like loud music, and poor service? . . We visited this place to celebrate my girlfriend Sarah's 30th Birthday. We were seated outside because it was SO loud inside, we didn't think we would be able to hear ourselves think. The waitress too a bit too long to greet us, or even take our drink orders. Our food took even longer. . . I split the Cottage Pasty with my friend, and my half was chilly in the middle. That aside, pasty is NOT my cup of tea. . . I ordered the PB&J pasty for desert thinking maybe that would be more up my ally, but it was an odd mix of flavor, and still not my thing. . . I didn't drink,  but I may consider coming back to check out their tap because it seemed impressive, butI will eat BEFORE I come.
