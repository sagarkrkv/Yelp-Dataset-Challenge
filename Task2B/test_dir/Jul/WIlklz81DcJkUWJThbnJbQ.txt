My experience at the Vdara was awful. I went on a bachelorette/bachelor party and we booked two deluxe suites and one premium view room. . . Now comes the down and dirty on the Vdara - and I mean "dirty" literally. The suites were okay. One of them had a fold out couch that was broken. The front desk was called and an hour later a guy shows up at 11pm to say he was sorry but couldn't help us as the couch was heavy and he was getting off work in 10 minutes. Yeah, he actually said that! They did bring a single bed on wheels but we had to cram the other person in another room. Awful. . . In the premium room, there was - I dare say - an unknown liquid under the sink that could or could not have been a bodily fluid; but I prayed it was white opaque soap. Towels were stained with what I hope was rust, we never got any replacement washcloths so we used hand towels, the sink drained slow and gurgled, and a few bathroom tiles were loose and rocked when you stepped on them. Plus the mini fridge was broken and wouldn't go to a cold setting but remained at "cool" which is only slightly better than lukewarm. Oh, and our alarm clock (which is unable to be unplugged from a socket) kept going off at odd times and the off switch didn't work. . . The pool was disgusting and when I got out of it (note I was not wearing lotion or anything on my skin before) I was covered in oil from the slick that resides on the water surface. So gross! . . We also got disgusting food from the marketplace and The Bar Vdara: how about some strange liquid from old berries in the middle of your yogurt parfait? or a plate of soggy calamari while it sits on a shelf covered by plastic wrap? or better yet, nachos that probably were made using ingredients prepared more than 24 hours ago? Yeah, I thought not. Again, awful. . . Lastly Vdara has "complimentary valet parking" which translates to having to pay each time you want to use your car (we felt so bad for the valets as they run themselves ragged to get the cars out) and a good 30 minute wait with everyone else and their mother during peak times in the morning and evening. . . Yeah, take it from me - avoid this place at all costs!!! It's is not worth staying at for free let alone for the prices they charge for their "premium" rooms.
I really enjoyed my recent stay at the Vdara.. . It was nice to be able to have a mini fridge in the room without having to pay $$ per day! . . It was also nice to be self contained, although I'm not sure who would really use the rest of the kitchen whilst in Vegas..?!. . I really liked the large windows and electronic blackout blinds. We had a nice view overlooking the Vdara pool and the Aria across the road.. . My one complaint would be that there is no indoor walkway to the other casinos. It might sound lazy but it is a luxury to avoid walking outside in the 115F desert heat to get to a casino or nice restaurant- especially if you sweat lots in the heat (!)
99 for deluxe suite.  Nice looking room with good view of the pool, Aria, and streets. Valet was not bad, about 5 to 10 mins wait. I would stay here again.
We stay in this hotel for EDC week 2013 I booked it because I though it was a 5 star hotel but it's not it 4 ahhh I will never make that mistake again. There no casino or night club or restaurant the room is small, we had a suite and we could barely sleep 5 people. All in all I will never ever stay here again!!!!
While our room was nice, and the price was great, our check-in experience left something to be desired.  When we arrived at our first room a locksmith was working on the door - which would not close properly - so we had to go back to the lobby for another assignment.  Our second room was larger than the first, and on the 51st floor which provided an excellent view of the Strip, but there was food left in the microwave from a previous guest that gave the room a terrible odor.  We had to ask the bellman for assistance with disposing of the trash.  We were thankful for a small kitchenette, but found there were no plates or flatware - you must request them.  The hotel also does not provide wash cloths or blow dryers in the rooms.  Perhaps these are also provided by request.  This is a nice hotel and a great place to stay if you get it at a discount and don't mind requesting resources from the front desk.
I was looking forward to staying vdara with my bf on 4th July weekend. . . Pros:. -Modern . -Non smoking . . Cons:. -Not on the strip. -Valet parking only (super busy long wait around the checkout time). -No casino. -Confusing light switches. -Bathtub looks big but not big enough for 2. -Blinds don't close completely (a big no no for LV if you want to sleep in). -Kitchen doesn't come with any dishes or cooking utensils  . -Room was dusty doesn't seem clean. -Hard to find bathrooms in the lobby (small signs no way of knowing). . I'd rather stay at Bellagio for location or Palms place for suites.
Place is great and dog friendly! I'm giving 2 stars coz I got my car back from the valet and smelled like burnt rubber. FYI my car has manual transmission. I don't trust their valet anymore. Vdara needs to tell their valet people to respect our cars when they drive it. Big disappointment.
This is def a 4.5 star hotel, but I rarely round up. I had a great time at Vdara. The service was attentive and the location is great because there are a lot of hotels within walking distance (under 6 min.) The room was nice but a tad small with the couch bed pulled out.  I def like that they had a kitchen; but the downstairs market had overpriced food (albeit it was good.) I wasn't put off by the fact there was no casino as it was a nice change of pace. That said, that there wasn't much to do at all (even in terms of dining) so that is what separates it from a five star place in my book. I'd stay here again for sure because it wasn't that expensive.
i want to give 4.25 stars. . its very nice! has amazing rooms, there nice and big and reasonably priced! the rooms are very classy looking, good service at the front desk , they take the MLIFE card so that helps. . the bad thing is that THERES NO CASINO. the good think about that is that theres no annoying dirty casino smoke smell but its vegas! you kinda want that feel! its a 7 minute walk to belaggio thats a good think but kinda bummed when you wanna gamble fast!! hahah and your tired... from all the walking
This is a really nice place but housekeeping needs to take better care of the rooms. The first two nights the room was not as clean as it should have been and the cleaning person on the third night did a really good job. Other than that, staff was great and resort is beautiful. Plus it doesn't charge for parking.
My wife and I stayed at the Vdara about three years ago and still talk about going back.  We liked the sleak rooms with the big windows.  The beds are the most comfortable of anywhere we've stayed in Vegas.  It's also fun to have a washer and dryer combo in the room.  We'll definitely be going back soon.
Got a suite on the 52nd floor. . If you have a M card, use that to get your room because we got a pretty good discount. . Things to note is that, IMO I think it's better to park at cosmo self park instead of Aria. Great staff, great room. it's just so nice inside. You're right next to Aria and Cosmo. And you can take the rail to Belaggio.. . And it's nice that it's not a casino. so no smoke smell here.
Best Hotel in Vegas!. . First off I'm not a gambler and not a fan of breathing smoky air, with that being said Vdara already had an edge in my book.. . The location is great. It connects to the Bellagio and is right next to the cosmopolitan.  . The rooms are amazing. We had a corner suite on the 40th floor and wow, what a view!! We brought food and drinks since there is a full size fridge and cook top(that helped save $$ on food costs). . Service was amazing from the front desk, bell service, and anything we needed they answered promptly.. The workout facility was adequate but not as impressive as some other hotels, but we still had a good workout.. The pool was relaxing. They played good music and there is lots of shade if you want to take a break from the sun.  It's not a party pool or lush gardens but it worked.  . . I have stayed at over 10 different hotels on the strip.... This is my favorite. . Each hotel has a different charm but it nice to be able to get away from the craziness and go right back to it when you want it.
Rooms here are PHENOMENAL! Stayed here for 5 nights with2 other buds in a Vdara Suite. Very nice & quiet. Super clean, well appointed stylish room. Appliances & kitchen area rocked. Spa was small but nice & quiet - $25/day? Security guys at the elevators were always polite and checking cards. Quiet! . . Walk 4 minutes down Harmon towards the strip, take a left into the Cosmo parking garage, and BAM! You're at the Cosmo. BOND Lounge and The Chandelier Bar are must stops at the Cosmo. Aria is even a  closer walk from the front door. The Wicked Spoon buffet at Cosmo is awesome (MUCH better than the Aria buffett IMHO). Quick free tram ride to either MC or Bellagio is available literally around the corner from the front entrance. Skip Crystals unless you are hitting the Social House Happy Hour.... . Not too much more expensive than most of the midlevel hotels on the strip, and cheaper (and just as nice as) than the higher rnd strip hotels. I really hate staying in a standard small hotel room now. Having a fridge and a living/lounge area is a nice convenience. . . Check out the Vdara. You won't be disappointed...
Overall, had a fantastic stay! Would come here again and would recommend to others. . . PROS:. - Was kind of nice to be in a resort that did not have a casino. Was refreshing walking through the lobby which smelled like a spa, rather than cigarettes and stale beer. . - The hotel decor and room decor was very modern, sleek, and relaxing. . - The room (had a city corner suite) was HUGE, had a nice floorplan, and lot's of windows which offered nice views. . - The room was high-tech with buttons that electronically opened and closed the window shades. . - The elevators came quickly, which is always nice. . - There is a tram which will take you directly to Aria, although Aria is literally a 3 minute walk from Vdara, so the tram isn't needed, although convenient. . - There is direct access to the Bellagio from Vdara which was nice and a very convenient way to access the strip. . . CONS:. - The hotel staffwas not particularly friendly. They came off as very snobby due to the luxurious nature of the hotel. I mean I get it, this is a nice resort, but drop the posh attitude and give us a smile. . - Although this didn't particularly bother me, it did bother my friend a bit; this is one of the few Vegas hotels that does NOT offer a self parking option, valet only, although per Vegas usual, the valet parking is complimentary. . . Really loved this hotel. If you've been to Vegas many times and have already stayed in some of the crazier hotel casinos along the strip, then give this one a shot. You'll probably end up loving this one of a kind hotel just as I did. However, if this is your first time in Vegas, maybe stay at a different resort with a casino and a theme to get the full Sin City experience.
It was a wonderful experience at Vdara stayed. . Room had a city n Bellagio fountain view except the poor too small n the chair a bit dirty at the poor. . No restaurant u have to walk too Arias, it not far but u have to go outside the building it hot.  . Non smoking n casino which it a huge plus.No self parking which it a little inconvenience because I'm not a person like to wait for a car to come I like to walk n take my car right away. . Also a little confuse when u first time come the direction wasn't that clear like other hotels. . Service was good n friendly,the reception area wasn't fancy like Cosmopolitans n other hotel.  . Highly recommend this to who doesn't like smoking n gambling.
Will come back. Service was amazing. They gave us the ultimate stay experience with there huge complimentary room upgrade. From a 1 bedroom suite to the 2 bedroom loft penthouse. Due to our kids coming last minute they accommodate our needs.. Thank you so much vdara. You made my anniversary celebration wonderful!
Another overdue review!  My family and I had the pleasure of staying here in March/April 2013.  We chose it mainly because of its location and the fact that it does not allow smoking and there is no casino.  We actually brought our kids to Vegas and just didn't feel right exposing them to gambling.  Besides, we come to Vegas to EAT, not gamble (no judgment!).  As I understand, Vdara was supposed to be a tower of condominiums, but don't quote me on that.  Our suite was AMAZING.  Our youngest even said that she'd rather live there than our own home (silly girl).  Loved the sleek minimalist styling, the spacious rooms, and incredible views from the wrap-around windows.  Bellagio, Aria, etc. are walking distance and there's easy access to the rail.  We would return to this hotel in a heartbeat on our next trip to Vegas.
We loved our stay at the Vdara and here's why.. . Non-smoking hotel. As a non-smoker, this is worth 5 stars on its own. I mean, walking into a hotel like this is LITERALLY a breath of fresh air. No smoke filled elevator ride. No pool side cloud of a toxic fumes. Aaahhh!. . There is no gaming on property either but seriously, walk around a semi-circle road just outside the front door and you'll have 5 minute access to either the Cosmopolitan or the Aria.. . The room was spectacular with a small bathroom at the entrance, washer anddryer, a full kitchen, dining seating for 4 people, a little family area with pull out sofa bed (which didn't seem very comfortable), a desk area and a separate master bedroom with full en suite. The automation of the entire suite was a little daunting at first, but by the end of the day, we were masters of opening and closing the sheers and blackout blinds.. . There are no real restaurants on property either, but again, walk out for 5 minutes and you have access to an abundance of fine dining. They do have room service, which we found to be wonderful. We ordered dinner one night (the short rib pappardelle) and our server was excellent. He made us feel like royalty... seriously! The servings were huge, so next time I would likely order just one dish and maybe a salad or side. . . Here's a hint if you plan to stay a few days in a room like this. Call housekeeping for some kitchen utensils and prep item, then head to Whole Foods via the free shuttle that leaves from PH (http://www.mytownsquarelasvegas.com/shuttle.html), pick up some delicious goodies to make right there, in your own private kitchen. . . Use the money you've saved on eating out to treat yourself to a great dinner at one of the many fine restaurants in Vegas.
Vdara is my hotel of choice for the past 3 vegas trips. Rooms are amazing The director Andy Knows how to treat people the right way. Corner Suite, Regular Room, Executive Suite all amazing, feels like you have your own apartment. Definitely staying here many more times.
Our room ran us $130, and they upgraded us to an executive suite free of charge when I asked if they had any upgrades. Most of the other resorts on/near the strip smell horrible because smoking is allowed, but thankfully Vdara has a no smoking policy. . . The WiFi was a bit dodgy at first, but it took them 5 minutes to resolve that and we had no issues with it afterwards. The service was generally great; staff members were helpful, accommodating, and anything we asked for was in our room within 10 minutes. . . There isn't a lot to eat at Vdara aside from Starbucks and a cafe. However, it is connected to Aria and Bellagio, both of which have plenty to eat. Also, there is no casino inside Vdara, but both Aria and Bellagio have casinos.. . If you're doing the Vegas Strip walk, Vdara is a great place to start. Just head through Bellagio, out the main doors, and there's a water-show there that runs every 15 minutes. The water show looks magnificent when it gets dark, so come early or be prepared to wait. You can access the rest of the strip from where the water-show takes place. . . All in all, I have no complaints. The only minor issue I have is that there is no self-parking; valet is the only option. On the other hand, the room was relatively cheap, the service was great, and Vdara is located in a prime area. The positives outweigh the negatives by a long shot.
LOOK FOR RATES HERE. REALLY GREAT PLACE. I stayed here for my trip to Vegas. Hands down the suite was amazing. Really nice and mondern place to stay at and it's on the famous strip. Whenever ever you want to gamble, they have their own miniature Casio. Best recommend to just across the street to Aria. Sleeping is the most important tool here in Vegas, so don't search any further. . Only bad experience is that my fridge doesn't get cold at all. So no nice cooled beers whenever you want.
Meh. We spent two nights in a deluxe suite and had mixed results. . . On the positive side, the room was modern, elegant and had fantastic views. We got a decent rate from Jetsetter (hint for deal hunters). The luxurious bathroom and poolside cabana were both highlights, throwing me points on the "happy wife, happy life" scoreboard. ;). . On the negative side, there were small shards of glass on the floor of our bathroom which my wife discovered by slicing her foot. The housekeeping manager apologized sincerely and cleaned it up, and the front desk took $30 off our bill for the inconvenience. For a supposedly higher end hotel, I would have expected better service.. . We'll probably stay somewhere else next time.
A stunningly beautiful hotel! I love Vegas, but don't love the cigarette smoke. The Vdara helps with that because it doesn't have a casino in the lobby and it is smoke free. Oh, what an amazing concept! Not only were the rooms fresh and new, but it was close to the center of the strip and next to some beautiful hotels as well. Our party got an inexpensive rate, it has a really good cafe restaurant in the lobby, a relaxing pool, and generous concierge staff. Stay here!
We stayed in the two story loft suite on the 56th floor over the 4th of July weekend. The suite was awesome, very comfy, very quiet and very plush in all the right ways.  If I had any complaint, it was that the exhaust system in the upstairs bathroom didn't work AND there isn't an air conditioning vent in there, so the upstairs bathroom was so hot it was almost impossible to be in there. We had to keep the door open at all times, and the blackout shades drawn. But the housekeeping would raise the blinds when they came, so it just got hot in there all over again. Relatively minor thing, but worth mentioning so that maybe they can do something to fix it.  The entire hotel is nicely appointed, the staff is very helpful and extremely polite and friendly. Valet service is very good.  We will be back again soon, for sure.
Vdara is clean, stylish and quiet. The lack of a casino is a refreshing change of pace for las Vegas. You can easily walk to Aria for your gambling needs. The lobby bar looks nicely appointed. Service was 5 star. The entire staff was knowledgeable,  friendly and professional.  There is a small market/cafe and a Starbucks in the lobby to cover your basic needs. The room was lovely. The furnishings were comfortable and stylish.  Everything was maintained and looked brand new. The bed was super comfy and available for purchase if you so choose. Our room was spotless. Water pressure was perfect, often a problem in hotels. It is also pet friendly. I would recommend Vdara to any one of my friends and family and we intend on returning for a staycation soon!
Just came back from a 4 day 3 night stay at the Vdara. It was my first and last stay at this hotel.  I was part of a large group of very well-traveled friends ranging in age from mid 30s on up whocame for a combined bachelor/bachelorette weekend. I mention our ages to establish we were not just some young punks checking in. In total there were about 15 of us. I booked my room directly through the hotel some booked their room through a deal offered on travel zoo/Jet. I will warn anyone thinking of staying because of an advertised deal on Groupon, Travel Zoo, Living Social etc. Don't do it! This hotel has an obvious attitude toward those guests who book through these discount sites. Several Rooms were booked as well as one what they call a "penthouse suite" for our bride and groom. This room is in no way what anyone would consider a "Penthouse" It is a basic 2 bedroom suite with a very small living room. The only thing I can say was deluxe about this room is it did have a full kitchen and full size refrigerator but who in the world is coming to Vegas to cook?  If you are one of the rare individuals looking to make dinner in Vegas I guess this would be the room for you. But if your are looking for something "Penthouse" to house a group of friends for meet ups, drinks etc. you are S.O.L.  Because I booked with the hotel directly my room was ready at check in time. Because some of our friends booked through travel zoo their rooms were not ready until hours and I mean hours waited past normal check in time. One of the rooms not ready was the so called penthouse suite. The front desk staff and management just threw up their hands saying there was nothing they could do about the room not being ready because it was booked through Travel Zoo/Jet and basically said it in a condescending manner like how dare you book through a discount site. Ultimately it should never matter how a guest comes to you once they are in your hotel. Because our bride and groom  and some of the wedding party could not get into their rooms to get ready for already made dinner plans we were late to our dinner by an hour and half. Not once did the hotel offer them "any" vacant room to get ready in while the penthouse was being cleaned knowing we had reservations. Not once did they offer to buy the bride and groom a drink while they waited. Not once did they offer any other services at a comp. These are indeed viable options to sometimes unavoidable room delays that has nothing to do with changing the travel zoo room rate which apparently is a never to be broken commandment read by Moses himself. It made the group of us feel like they were indeed actually punishing my friends for booking through a discount site. Finally they get their room. Only to find out the hotel lost the brides luggage. Seriously Vdara? The bride herself had to come down to the luggage room to locate her own bag which was sitting on a chair in their storage room. Again what did she get for the trouble? A great big shrug from the staff.  I could really go on forever at the problem after problem encountered at this hotel and the overall attitude of not giving a flying fruitcake by the hotel management. But I will finish with a summary of the most ridiculous points.. . *Master Switch-If you don't hit this switch located in the doorway none of the lights in your room will work. . . *Dusty-The room furnishing are very modern but our room was extremely dusty.. . *Mini bar fridge-I would have gladly paid the overpriced mini bar charge for a bottle of water. But I couldn't because it locked me out. It opened once upon arrival and then locked me out the entire rest of our stay for who knows what reason.. . * The blackout shade-They have these fancy shades that are open and closed by a switch on the wall. It's not one continuous shade it's in portions so all the places that don't connect let in the bright Las Vegas sunshine starting at dawn. . . * The pantry/restaurant/gift shop- This is the only place in the hotel to buy food/drink or necessities so it's very busy but not staffed appropriately and has one register for all. Therefore you will wait a long very long time.. . *Do not bring professional type cameras. A photographer was hired for one hour to take pictures of our group to commemorate the occasion. The hotel shut us down like we were trying to film a porno in the lobby the security came at us extremely rude which was not necessary.. . *Do not have anyone leave anything for you at the front desk. We did a burlesque lesson as a group and the instructor dropped off a gift for the bride. A msg was left in her room that she had a package waiting for her downstairs. When she went to retrieve it they had lost it. Then questioned her as if she was lying about someone leaving a msg. After about an hour they finally found her package.. . So to sum up my review Vdara don't do it. Literally stay anywhere else. The back seat of your friends car would provide better customer service.
Wahnsinns Zimmer mit unbeschreiblichem Ausblick auf den Strip. Fur Vegas Verhaltnisse angenehme Poollandschaft. Nachteilig waren die hohen Nebenkosten (Geschirr fur die Kuche muss zusatzlich gezahlt werden, Fruhstuck im Hotel gibt es nicht unter 20 Dollar, Steuern und Resortgebuhren pro Nacht etwa 30 Dollar)
I give one star since I cannot give it zero star. I booked two rooms through vdara website, upon arrival, they assigned one suite at 48th floor and the other room at 8th. I explained to them I need to live close enough to my mom's room so I can take care of her, best thing they could do is to put me in a room on 17th floor and my mom's suite on 16th. Waited a good 15 minutes for luggage, waited another good 30 minutes for housekeeping to come and make sofa bed. Asked for water kettle but they rant out so they brought me a pan instead. Sleeper sofa was broken so they brought a thick duvet as additional foundation/mattress. After helping mom settle down, headed back to my room, found some mop looking fabric by the sink in the bathroom, maybe it belongs to housekeeping? lol, such an experience.
Do Not Stay Here If u r a Smoker!!!!! dear lord they will treat u like lucifer himself! But bear in mind they will still gladly take your hard earned money all the while... I am a big gambler and I always tip the valet 10 or 20 bucks to park the benz in the front of the valet so I can keep an eye on it. This stay was no different... until I went to get my car and the valet guy berated me for smoking outside and told me I must be a moron for thinking the trashcan had an ashtray!! he really made me feel like a 2nd class person and it really upset me. I felt better knowing at least he wouldnt be getting 20 bucks... I told the front desk about the incident but they just shrugged and said I would have to file a formal complaint. my career is customer service based and I get yelled at all day and it would be nice to be treated a little better when I am the customer. the rooms are nice and huge and I liked the little cafe/market they have. the gal at the pool specifically remembered my name each day and was super sweet. my little daughter has been throwing up all day today from the chlorine being too strong. All the room service did was throw away all my reusable grocery bags so we didnt have anything to take the rest of our food home in. I really consider myself one of the best tippers around and it makes me sad to be treated the way I was. I get that its a non smoking facility and I was very respectful of that... even the bartender told me that if I want matches I would have to walk to Aria or Bellagio...No matter how nice ahotel is, if their employees are mean and rude then no one will want to stay there...
This has been our preferred hotel since they opened. A nice casino free haven away from but still close to the madness. Love the rooms, extremely dog friendly. However, I knocked off a star because the room service is questionable.
It is not even 1 star.....Horrible!!!!! Reserved a deluxe suite with upgrade view. BEWARE they think looking at a pool is that view. It is advertised that the upgraded view is bellagio view. So that's the 1st gripe. The 2nd is, the suite I paid extra for was supposed to be GREAT and have washer and dryer, all the amenities you can need in a room. NOT!!!! Do NOT pay extra to upgrade! It will be very disappointing.  3rd, we left our room with the need for towels and cleaning. 6 hours later we returned. No one came, and when I called housekeeping she said, "there are a lot of rooms that had to be cleaned today" I get it! But it is not my problem. Best to stay at a hotel that has the staff and does not deceive 1st time visitors. The valet......HELP them please! !!! I can go on and on. The only good thing about this visit to Vegas was we got to see more of the town because we did not want to be in our hotel or wrong room.
We stayed over the weekend in the corner suite. It's a mixed results with the net effect being slightly negative:. . 1. The sofa bed was broken. We found at about 8 PM. It was never fixed. On the plus side, the hotel gave us another room while they are trying to fix the problem. However, the time that it took them to fix the problem (and the lack of initiative from the management) was disappointing. We had to call several times.. . 2. The new room has broken bed (on the left side). The support was broken.. . 3. There was a half-eaten open ice cream in the freezer (seriously?). . 4. They compensated us one night. So, the bill was rather low (the only reason that this is a 2-star review).. . Other than that, the hotel is modern. The view is awesome and it is relatively clean. I will give Vdara a try in the future. Hopefully, I can upgrade this review.
Okay. . . Check-in was smooth, and we were moved to a room on the 50th floor the second night (mostly a view of in and out burger and the highway but nice enough). . Rooms are suites, which is nice and the bathroom is large enough for two girls to get ready in. Bed is comfortable. . . Pool is meh. $50 for a daybed, $150+ for a cabana. Came across a number of broken chairs. The pool was pretty crowded most days and was warm and cloudy by 2:30 p.m. Pool food was bleh. $12 for an order of chicken nuggets, $15 for a quesadilla with nothing in it but cheese. Servers were nice.. . Bar Vdara? Bar barf-ara. Ordered yucca fries, Napoli flatbread and lobster tacos. These three items take over 35 minutes to appear.  Lobster tacos do appear and our waitress drops half of the lobster on the floor. Nevermind the lobster is cold. The food was god awful. She comped our bill, so we decided to try market cafe the next day. (Save yourself the trouble and walk to Aria or to the Cosmopolitan). Market Cafe again means waiting over 45 minutes for 2 paninis (? They take 3 minutes to cook) Prosciutto panini has exactly one piece of ham on it, $18 dollars later. The quality of food did not match the cost in any way, shape or form. The food options were really disappointing. . . We also had to harass housekeeping to clean our room (which they did eventually,  but probably wouldn't have if we didn't call them). . Consierge can get you free passes to Liquid and good deals at clubs.. . If you don't want a casino in your hotel,  this is your spot.
Yes, there is no casino in this hotel but that was not a problem at all!!! It is a short walk into the Bellagio from here and The Cosmopolitan is also nearby as is Aria. But the room!!! The room was very clean, sleek, modern and very spacious. I had a "Premium View Room" which was given to me when I asked the clerk for a high floor with a view of the Bellagio fountains. She whispered that she would put me on the 51st floor in a premium view room, I was so happy I tipped her $20. The room had AMAZING views! Panoramic view from the mountains to strip to actually seeing planes make their approach to McCarran. One might say you don't go to Vegas to stay in the room but this room kind of makes you want to stay in it!. . The bed is SUPER comfortable, I want to find the mattress brand and type and buy one for home! The view was amazing. We initially had a stopped up bathroom toilet and we called for service and it was resolved within 45 minutes. We also had no problems getting Housekeeping as I have heard others say but then we never called later than 2 PM.. . My ONLY complaint would be that the pool was kind of small and the water was too warm. Maybe that was unavoidable at 108 degree outdoor temperatures but just be aware.
Vdara where you might get pregnant by just sitting on the couch!. . This hotel has unqualified staff that is incompetent. Stayed here for business this week check in was ok the room wasn't ready but they quickly found another room on a different floor. When dropping off luggage into the room and checking out the layout of the room it was noticed that there was a huge white stain on the couch. I think we all know what this was gross!!! . . So here comes the trip to the front desk to alert the staff of the condition of the room and to request a room change. They should have apologized up and down this didn't happen. They should have also offered to change the room it shouldn't have taken us requesting that be the course of action.. . The luggage was still in the room so the receptionist said the key would work for an hour so we could collect our belongings to move to another room. The receptionist said she would note the room and have someone come clean the room after the hour was up. When going up to the room we were unable to get into the room as the key was no longer working, big shocker here! While standing at the door a British couple approached telling him us we were trying to get into there room. Can u believe the hotel just reassigned another unsuspecting guest to the room with the nasty stain without sending someone up to clean the room. After explaining to the couple what happened they let us in the room so we could collect belongings, then head back downstairs. . . The crazy thing about this whole situation is that it happened to another individual in our party. Really this is a positive hotel experience??? I think not!  Hotels should be policed like restaurants .... where are the random spot inspections.
