Love this place!!!  Everything's great but the king crab and snow crab can be a lil too salty sometimes.  If you love  seafood and don't mind getting messy you gotta try this place out!
It's a fun experience. You get your hands dirty & work for your food in a fun way. Very casual place & when you walk in the aromas hit you in the face. . My first time & it was great! Staff is also very friendly.
We had the hot and juicy hot seasoning and it was incredibly delicious. The customer service was great and the food was out of this world. Parking was hard to come by so we were thankful we got there early. We can't wait to go back.. . Perfect spot if you want to go off the beaten path in Las Vegas.
Never get enough of it! Always have shrimps hot N juicy or garlic butter. 5/5! Sweet potato fries is delicious as well. 5/5! My friends always add a corn. I ordered lobster once. 4/5! Lol I don't know how to eat it!! They said they can crack it for you. Crabs are good, my friends' favorite! 5/5! Sausages are optional,  I had them sometimes. 3/5! I have been both places. My friends like it on Decatur 4/5!,  but I kinda like it at Valley View because it is newer, even though there is wired smells and long queue! 3/5!
A vegas must!! Love the food every time we go....we order the mussels, shrimp and crawdads...yummmmm! The cajun fries are delish and u can never fail with the hot n juicy seasoning!
Its Ok, Not the best But great service and food
One of the best see food place ,  love hot n juicy
This is my favorite place to eat in Vegas! I love the Cajun - hot n juicy spicy seasoning. Highly recommend their Cajun fries and etouffee. . . The wait can be a little overwhelming, it can be up to 45 minutes or more...and when it's hot, it's not so fun to wait outside for your table. You do end up smelling like garlic afterward....so ladies leave your nice purses at home ;) . . I wish they would give locals some perks, since I eat here so much! Literally...I would go 2-3 times a month.
Omg so many coworker and even my hairstyle told me about this place! So i finally decided to go on a Friday after work. I LOVED IT!! I don't want to sound like a total fatty BUT I was in heaven the whole time focused on my bag of crab!  The moment you open the bag of yummiest this amazing aroma hits you in your face, and you will just like i knew, it was about to go down!Everything was amazing. I ordered the snow crab with the  spicy hot and juicy seasoning; I was told it was the best and most popular, so of course I wanted to try that one first. The extras were very favorable with the hot and juicy seasoning and  is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,  potatoes(.60 cent), sausage(1/2 dozen 2.45) and corn( i believe .75) . I now know  any other sides or anything extra aren't needed. I ordered a side of butter( which is a dollar extra) and didn't even touch it. . . Also important: the customer service was great! Everyone was so nice and smiled with their service. HUGE plus for me! Last comment, I suggest that whenever you go don't come all dressed up because although this meal is  incredible it can also be very messy, which is the reason for the commentary bid and gloves that are given. All im saying is don't come to this place thinking you'll be going somewhere nice after because you will be leaving smelling like hot and juicy, and maybe a little sauce on your clothes.. . I really hope your experience is as enjoyable as my experience!
If you love seafood and spices this is definitely a must!! We came around 4 and the place was packed the whole time we were there. Good service - they only serve beers and one wine, a Riesling, solely by the bottle. We got 1lb of crawfish 1 dungeness crab, and a few sides. All great tasting. You can get spice levels 1-5 on each dish.
My favorite place to eat in Vegas! Went here twice during our trip. Great customer service. Food is to die for!! Love everything about this place!
Absolutely love this place. It never disappoints. The service is always great and the food is always on point. This is a must every time I'm in the area. We always get the king crab legs and shrimp. Mix it up a little and get different seasonings every time you go. Never had to wait, but are always here before the lunch/dinner rush.
After seeing Adam Richman eating crawfish here on "Man Vs Food", I made sure this was a place I must visit while in Las Vegas.I feel kind of left out giving only 2 stars to this place, where there are mostly 5 star reviews for this place. Maybe my experience was a fluke?. . I came here around 8pm, and waited for around 40 minutes for a table. There were a few tables that cleared up quickly, but the staff didn't clean it up immediately... so the 40 minute wait could have been more of a 25-30 minute wait. They also have a strong garlicky yummy smell in the air which made the wait felt worse.. . Ordered 2lbs of shrimp, 2lbs of crawfish, 1 bag of king crab legs and some Cajun fries in their special spicy hot and juicy seasoning. I felt that their Cajun fries are over seasoned... Quite salty... Their shrimp was the best out of everything, but the shrimp was just okay. The crawfish wasn't juicy as their restaurant name would lead one to believe... Maybe it's not fresh that day??? The king crab legs felt rough and overcooked... and it was the blandest one of all... . . The service here was not very good. My group had to flag waiters multiple times to get bibs, crackers, gloves, drinks, refills. I eventually gave up and just walked up to the register to ask for these items... The decor here really sucks too, very dim, simple, and at times looks quite questionable regarding sanitation... I will not be coming back. I personally love the boiling crab much more.
Big fan of Man vs Food and the Travel Channel, so we had to come try this place out. We don't really like Crawfish so we order Shrimp instead. we have tried different seasonings they offer but end up liking the hot n juicy special seasoning extra spicy. It has so much flavor.
Really Clean, Fresh, Great Service !
love this place! So flavorful and good prices, I recommend the shrimp and king crab legs whole shabang spices... medium you tell them how spicy you like it with a cold beer! ask for extra lemon and be sure to bring some plastic gloves because you will be eating only with your hands.. also recommend the seasoned fries! great for games and fights because they have plasma tv screens around the entire restaurant only down side is you get dirty.
This place is legit. Awesome crab legs shrimp crawfish. Everything was spicy and delicious. Yum. Great service. Another hidden gem in Vegas. You will get dirty but it's so worth it
