They have so many bogus fees that are ridiculous plus they have the oldest slots I've ever seen. Pass this place up
I'm a Total Rewards member and somehow wound up getting comped for two nights here. I was in a 17th-floor suite in the Masquerade Tower, and the room was very nice, complete with a view of several casinos on the Strip. There were a few minor issues, namely a couple spots of paint in weird places, but the bed was comfortable, service was excellent (they waived an early check-in fee when I showed up Sunday morning), and I enjoyed my stay.. . Staying off the strip can be a bit of an issue, but they do run shuttles to Bally's and Harrah's every 20-30 minutes. I do wish they were a bit more frequent since it's inconvenient to wait so long in 110-degree heat, but it's a free shuttle, so I can't make too many complaints. The buffet is pretty good, and the casino is huge. Shockingly, I even saw a few $5 blackjack tables on my way out (a Tuesday afternoon), which is very low considering the usual limits for tables. I'd absolutely stay here again.
Interesting during the wsop event only for me. It would not be my first choice otherwise. They raise prices exponentially during that time frame.
Only one wireless device can be connected for free if you are a guest here.
Did not stay at this hotel but did go to the buffet and it was nasty!! Food looked nasty and the place is filthy. The whole property needs a good pressure wash inside and out. Stay on the strip its worth the extra cost.
I like that during the week it is free for locals! Also you can bring your kids there is a pool with a sandy area which is great for all ages and if your kids are in the teens you can let them hangout it the under 21 area... and you can go to the adult pool which is only open on weekends. They have a dj but it's just okay.. I think that pool used to be the sapphire pool. Also there drinks are kind of boring they need a menu redo.
The Rio is a pretty decent hotel. The rooms are spacious and the whole hotel is very clean. It is a mid range priced hotel, but using Total Rewards you can get a number of nights comped if you are staying for a while, which makes it quite a cheap option.. The club on the roof has amazing views of Vegas, so I definitely recommend taking a trip up there to take a gander.. I do have to say though that the location is a bit of a pain in the derriere. It is a good 15-20 minute walk to the strip and the main road is a little sketchy, so I would not advise walking it on your own. There is a free shuttle bus that takes you to Bally's and Paris Hotel's every 30 minutes, so that helps, but it can be a little on the slow side.
Rio pool! No longer a hot spot free pool for local son the weekend. They started charging for pool entry a month ago for Friday - Sunday.  $20 per adult and $10 for children.  No wonder it's completely dead for a Saturday!
I may never stay anywhere else. The Rio was awesome. We had booked just a normal room for $116, when we got there the guy at the desk (I wish I knew his name) upgraded us to the two story penthouse suite on the 20th floor for free!! Everyone was so nice, our room was beautiful (of course) andthe hotel was clean. I loved the Rio and it made my Vegas trip so much better.
Arrived around midnight on Thursday night. Took over 2 hours for the bellhop to bring our bags.  Then gave an excuse that only 1 bellhop at that time of night. I don't care what the excuse is. 2 1/2 hours later, I'm sleeping and no longer in the mood to go have a couple of beers and hit the slots. Had they told me how long it would be, I would have taken my own bags, even if it meant two trips. . . Upgraded to a double masquerade suite. Decent view. Yes strip view, but kind of a side view. Old dingy room. One light didn't work at all. No robes nor tv remote. They don't even give you free coffee anymore. What?!  Yea $8 from the mini bar. Didn't buy that either. We were on the 28th floor and could hear the music from the pool all day and then the club at night. Was a joy from 2am til 9am with no noise or thump thumping. . . With that being said...the room was quite spacious. Three of us and I didn't feel cramped. The bed was hard and the pillows even worse. There is a small window that looks from the bathroom into the bedroom. They need to offer some blinds with that or some way to cover it. We just used our soap and shampoo bottles. Staff (except bellhop). . We did win here, so that's the only thing I can't complain about. And the cocktail service was rather speedy.  I also like that it's NOT on the strip and because of that, not generally super packed.
BORING. We always stayed on the strip and visited the Rio in the evening. Enjoyed the gondolas in the sky along with the little stage show that they put on. This was the 1st time we actually stated at the Rio. Unfortunately, both shows have been eliminated. Even though we had out car, we took the shuttle to the strip. No fun waiting in 112 temperature for a shuttle. Too much of a hassle.  NO reason to go there.
I have no idea how this place is rated 3 stars. Ive been to vegas 3 times. We try to stay at different places to check out new hotels. But by far this is the best hotel we have stayed at.. . Pros . Huge rooms. Huge bed. Safe . . The have a shuttle that stops at 1am and circulates every 30 min.. . FRIDGE!! Weve stayed in other hotels way more expensive. They have no fridge. Your in vegas for goodnes sake you need a fridge  . . Spa services need to relax you get to go once each day you stay it was amazing. N they have delicious drinks in there.. . Wifi some hotels still have dial up wtf ?! Lol. . Cons:. Its off the strip. Some people might find that a bad thing but i really enjoyed it. It was all drunk party people on the strip and you got to experience that but then you go to rio and you feel like you were away from all the craziness but still in vegas. . . Its a bit hard to get around. If we left somethin in the car it was a mission to go get it lol. . . Its so great you really need to check it out.
Came here for the first time to try out the carnival buffet I had bought with a groupon. The buffet is pretty pricey but there is a lot of choices! Nice, clean, lively atmosphere and most the food I had was good. The Casio area didn't offer the variety of slot machines I am used to seeing in most places and the layout i found to be strung out and crowded feeling! Not sure I would come here again, way too many other places to spend my time and money.
An absolutely disgusting example of a allegedly nice vegas hotel. Why?. . 1) Security is horrible - two straight days we walked into our room while the maid was cleaning and she didn't ask us to verify our key. 2) The rooms are dirty - mold growing near the showers...spotted carpets..,you name it. . 3) The pool area is awful - stuff floating in the pool, filthy deck chairs, garbage laying in the common areas. . 4) Rude staff - when you mention 1,2 or 3 they act like you are the problem. 5) The buffet is terrible - cold and over priced food. 6) The little things - like how about having elevators that all work...or buttons that exist...and/or don't get stuck. . The place needs so much work. . . Edit/addition: I've been staying at the Rio for 10 plus years...2-3 times per year. It will be my last time. . Good luck!
Older hotel rooms but still in decent shape, queen beds could use replacement. Service was good as well. Pool was a great place to hang out, ton of kids, pools and jacuzzis could use a little rehab. Decent stay, would go again.
I like rios casino Kuzz the food is reasonable for me that can afford to pay for all my family to eat  room is big and service is good  Oh and the food was great compared to other casino n their price    Good job rios  I am coming back next year again  and hoping getting good service as we'll like this time
This use to be a decent hotel when it was remodeled.  Now it's a dump.  Room show all kinds of wear and tear.  We booked 3 rooms and all were crappy.  The billing receipts is atrocious!  The charges don't match anything on my itinerary or bank statement.  Stop trying to settle charges that are more than the actual charge. . . Pool has mold by the water fall.  Customer service has more attitude than a Kardashian.  I can go on and on. I'll never stay here again!
All-around BAD experience. :-(. . I recently stayed at the Rio while I was playing in the WSOP Main Event. I must say that this was a very disappointing experience and not one I was expecting from a Total Rewards Casino.. . When I arrived in the afternoon I waited in line for over 45 minutes to talk to the front desk to check-in and there was no room available for me, even though I booked one over 6 months in advance. The individual working was very rude and not willing to help. Once I got a manager she said they were cleaning a room and would text me in 30 minutes when it was available. about 90 minutes later I went back down to the front desk to check on my room as I had not received any text.. . I was staying on the 15th floor which I was assured was not pet friendly yet there was a Dog barking throughout the night. I called the front desk to let them know of this and they didn't do anything to help.. . Also, my fiancee ordered a basket for me which was a surprise and I did not receive until Tuesday. They said it was sitting there for a few days. I don't understand why it was not delivered promptly to my room.. . Notes. - Out-dated Hotel. - Dirty Rooms and Pool Area. - Slow and Rude Staff. - Terrible Customer Service. . There are so many other options, don't waste your time trying to book the Rio.. . Updated:. . I actually checked out a day early and still go charged for the resort fee for the extra day. I emailed Caesars and again they did NOTHING for me.
The rooms were fairly priced,  Good sized. There was a funky ass smell coming from one of the drains. Nothing to scare us off tho. It was nice to have a fridge. The pool area is great in my opinion
We came here to play roulette and had a great time. Donny was awesome. I loved that the cocktail waiter came by many times!  I rarely find this in any casino these days. This place is very trendy and fun.
I do not remember Rio being this horrible. Rude staff and not willing to accommodate guests. Very unorganized and they make everything seem like it's your fault. Took over an hour to get our room and we walked into the room and found phone ripped out of its socket. How are we supposed to call the front desk or get our bags?
The Rio was once a great hotel/casino in Vegas. We have stayed here many times and usually because of the Seafood buffet and the beach area at the pool. It is located off the main strip so it makes it harder to visit other hotels. . . When I walked in today I felt sad because it's so outdated and most of the stores are out of business. We have brought our kids here several times over the last 15 years and I can't believe they have let this once great hotel become almost a ghost town. It is a Saturday and the casino is almost empty. . . I know the rooms are very large and just need an update. If the owners would put a little time and money into this awesome hotel it could draw a great crowd. I sure hope that people keep visiting the Rio because it would be so sad to see it go.
The hotel is outdated. But the Penn and Teller magic show is a must see. We came here for the show and decided to take off the minute it ended.
Was here for the Penn and Teller show. The Rio seemed outdated and smelled like stale cigarettes.
Once a great hotel... Now just an average hotel with big rooms!. . I have been coming to the Rio for over 20 years. I was here when the masquerade tower just opened and had the hottest night club in Vegas. They had the best buffet back then too.... . I know there are always newer and greater casinos that will come and go but Harrahs needs to understand that you can't cut back on everything and expect tons of people to still show up!. . For those of you that don't know, the Rio had an amazing FREE show- Carnival in the Sky that was totally discontinued about a year ago! People loved it and came here just to see it. Then after, they would do some gambling, eat food and spend money in the shops. Now that area is totally dead! I spoke to many of the employees and they are unhappy about it too and saw a major drop in business!. . Another disappointment was at the iBar. They got rid of the dancers that came on stage every so often. It made the place cool and hip to hang out and buy drinks!  Now it's just a regular bar with expensive drinks and I probably won't be spending my money there anymore. . . Now for the good... Rooms are large with lots of room for 5 or more people if u need it.  You get a lot more room for your money compared to the strip. This is the main reason I still come here but not sure after all the cutbacks. However they do charge a resort fee and will charge you for an early check in! I was charged $10 to check in 2 1/2 hrs early. . . Buffet is still good but very pricy now at around $33/person for dinner on a weekend.  Hash House had the best breakfast and lunch. They hit a homerun with this place!!! See my review for more info on that. . . Pool is decent for families with kids. But not great for the young party crowd. I believe there are 4-5 pools all together but one is a 21 and older only. . . Casino has lots of table games that have lower limits than what you can typically find at the high end casinos on the strip. There is also no shortage of slot machines either. . . If you want to experience the Las Vegas Strip, this is NOT the place for you! But if you want a big room and a big casino, then this may be for you!
