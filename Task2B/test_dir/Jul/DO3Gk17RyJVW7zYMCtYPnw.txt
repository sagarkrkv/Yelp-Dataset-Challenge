The whole restaurant was fabulous! From the exterior look, to the ambiance, to the food! I had a shrimp dish that was an appetizer for my meal and it was absolutely fantastic! One of the best dishes I have had in a long time. We also had a banana cream dessert but it was just so so for me. In the end, I absolutely loved this restaurant and would go back again (if only it was closer to home!)
Salty..bland..totally underwhelmed. I have to admit, I had some expectations since the restaurant is owned by Bobby Flay especially since he's always talking about flavors and southwestern cuisine. But it was just so..whatevers.. . We ordered the shrimp tamale, queso fundito dip, and the Chile rellano. The shrimp tamale was just alright..nothing special. The queso fundito dip wasnt bad but it certainly wasnt worth $18 bucks. My husband ordered the chile rellano and the crust was so dry and dense. Overall the food was just heavy and bleh.. . The service was average. The server left us with the dessert menu and didnt come back for 15 mins so by that time I changed my mind and all I wanted to do was leave.  Dont believe the hype..
Great service, great food!  Fries are good, ask for chipotle mayo for dipping.  We tried the burgers, and the salmon club sand.  I plan to eat here for lunch every time we come to vegas.  Bobby flay does a great job with this restaurant.
The best steak I've had in years.. A table of eight and not one negative word or eye rolling look. . A late dinner setting for a large group with no reservations was no problem for Mesa. Wait staff was informative and very attentive giving expert advice on the specials and drinks.. The reasons we go to restaurants like these are for the total food experience. Family and friends that are better than family are a must. Now the food must be the stars of any food review and it is at Mesa. From the grilling of the steaks to the searing of the scallops all done with great skills.. Can I afford to eat here all the time... No.  Wouldn't want to, that would take away of the awe of this food.  . Last words... If you have healthy taste buds you'll like Mesa grill.
Really?  4 stars for this place?  I don't get it.  We had the chili relano, shrimp tamale, and queso fundito dip.  Chili relano had this really thick dry crust that looked good but didn't go with the chili relano at all.  The tamale was so-so and the queso fundito dip was good but not $18 good.  Very disappointed.  Expected so much more for the price and an Iron Chef.  Service is whatevers too.
Totally underwhelmed. I had high expectations since it's a Bobby Flay restaurant.  We got the chicken skewers, the black bean chicken quesadilla, and the grilled chicken. All of the food was mediocre at best, while I was expecting out of this world amazing flavor. Totally not worth the $$$.
We went for brunch on a Saturday and it was not busy at all - no need for reservations. They started us out with a complimentary selection of their breakfast breads.  Six thimble sized biscuits, a cheddar jalapeno corn muffin, two pieces of blueberry coffee cake and two miniature chocolate scones.  It looks pretty, and is a fun gesture, but the only bread of note was the blueberry coffee cake.  The scones and biscuits were both very dry.. . We split the shrimp tamale appetizer, smoked chicken sweet potato hash and the cheese grits.  The tamale was just as good as it looks in photos, and if I came again I would definitely order one (or two) of those.  The sauce was very salty, so if you are sensitive to that you might want to pick a different item.  The hash had a really strong vinegar flavor.  I like vinegar, but the whole thing just tasted like someone had dumped a bunch of cheap hot sauce all over it.  Plus, it came out really fast, and was lukewarm.  With all the great reviews of this dish, I was very unimpressed - especially with the $18 price tag. The cheese grits were not at all what I was expecting.  Good Southern style grits are fluffy, these are very heavy.  They tasted like cream cheese and green chili, so it is hard to say they were bad, they just weren't at all as expected.. . The service was attentive - too attentive!  One of the servers was literally standing over my husbands shoulder waiting for him to take his last bite.  This just felt awkward.  . . Perhaps dinner would be a better time to go, but I just feel like this place is more about aesthetics and less about freshness and flavor.
Food was great, service was not.. . We ordered:. Tiger shrimp & roasted garlic corn tamale - the sauce is to die for. Coffee rubbed filet mignon - perfectly grilled mid rare, and seasoned well. . Sauteed spinach - nothing to write home about. Lobster out of the shell - very tasty, strong citrus flavor in sauce. . Food was good, not great, but I can't make a proper judgement on the food because we were still pretty full from a Bachannal lunch buffet.  I will say that the open kitchen was a nice touch.  It looks like a well-run crew.  Food came out promptly and the presentation was excellent on everything.  These cooks know what they are doing.. . What ruined the experience for us were the cold hosts and waiter.  These kids had an irritated expression on their faces throughout the entire service.  Our first experience with a hostess when we walk in was seeing the back of her head while she spent a couple minutes trying to figure out where to put some sort of vase or jar in a drawer.  I had to say something to get her attention.  . . After we finished eating our entrees, our kid waiter tossed the dessert menus on the table without saying anything and quickly left.  I tried to get his attention to let him know we didn't want any and I guess he didn't hear or didn't care to turn around.  . . As we were leaving, the host past by and said a cold farewell with an irritated expression on his face, without having the courtesy of looking at us.  I'm not asking for a Chili's-type super excited "Thanks for coming!"  But I did just drop $160 on a $135 bill.  A little less attitude would be nice.. . Out of the four people we came in contact with on the wait staff, only the older gentleman acted like he worked in a [former] Michelin-starred restaurant.  If I could have personally handed our tip to that older gentleman, I would have and left nothing for the others.. . I would have come back for the food, but I won't be back due to the fast-food-like service.
My friend said and I quote, "You have to go to Mesa Grill, you'll hate yourself if you don't.". . That was enough to convince me to give Mesa Grill a try. Please note, they have a dress code for men, no exposed shoulders aka no tank tops . . I loved the wonderful array of colors cascading around the room and the overhead wood beams were gorgeous. . Recommend: . . Shrimp Tamale-sauce was simply marvelous, tamale was fresh and equally packed with flavor. I will admit it sure is one pricey tamale but its worth it, trust me . . Ribeye-quality of meat was superb, so many complex flavors going on balanced in harmony. . Roasted Corn and Mashed Potato sides-best corn side dish I have ever had!!! Mashers were also great, loved the cheesy sauce on top. . Bread Basket-a lovely variety of tasty morsels, especially the blue corn muffin. . Service was top notch, nothing else left to say!. . Overall Thoughts. . Damn you Bobby Flay, you sauce master!
I really wanted to like this restaurant since Bobby Flay's food looks so good on tv. The food was bland and oily. No flavor. I was hoping for lots of pepper flavor but couldn't find any. I'm glad I came for lunch to try out the food; I would have been very upset if my dinner was this bad. Worst of all....the service! Not only did  our waiter roll his eyes at us when ee ordered water to drink, he was absent the entire time we were there. We had to flag him down! The worst part were the napkins that left white lint all over my black pants. The waiter didn't apologize or offer to bring me a lint roller! I had to go back to my room to change my clothes before heading back out. Stay away!
very good meal, did not have a reservation but the did find us a table.. Salad my wife and I shared was not worth the money, nothing on the dish for $13. . Entree's were very good my wife had the chicken and I had the pork medallions which were excellent. . would go back again
Service: good, though not excellent. waiter gave good recommendations overall, service was prompt enough. one star off because the server placed my entree on top of my silverware. i thought that was strange for a restaurant at this price range.. . bread: was not very good. the cornbread looked much better than it tasted. lacked flavor. walnet raisin was pretty good. the (asiago?) cheese bread was meh. . . Tiger shrimp+roasted garlic corn tamale: 4/5: shrimp was not the plumpest. it was also very salty. however, the tamale was exceptionally delicious. i generally strongly dislike tamales but ordered this due to the waiter's recommendation and despite the overly salty shrimp, i thought it was very good overall.. . new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin: 5/5: i personally didn't love it but i do appreciate that it was an excellently executed dish. pork cooked perfectly. seasoned with a nice ancho chile kick. the tamale, again, to delicious! mesa grill may have changed my opinions on tamales altogether. . . side of corn: 4/5: again, well executed, but personally didn't love it. overall, i've had better. . . drink: had thier signature margarita...nothing special at all. had a cucmber seomthing drink that was very refreshing.. . i highly doubt i would return but i think that's more because of a personal preference, not because the restaurant was lacking in any way. overall, well executed dishes. well seasoned. good service. with exceptional tamales!!
My husband and I went there for a late lunch. We were going to a nice dinner later that night so I didn't want a huge meal. I ordered the sixteen spice chicken salad and my husband ordered cobb lamb salad. My salad was delicious as was my husband's. The food was wonderfully flavored and felt it personified Bobby Flay with all of those southwest flavors.. We also had some awesome margaritas. They were so good, we went back the next night and each had one before we went out again that night. Getting thirsty just thinking about them -- yum!. Highly recommend Mesa Grill.
This is far and away my favorite restaurant in Vegas. It is absolutely incredible.. . Must-tries:. -blue pancake duck appetizer . -white peach margarita. -cactus pear margarita. -jalapeno bread (which comes in the basket....ASK FOR MORE!). -cojita cheese roasted corn side order (oh my jesus). . Eh, fine but won't make you want to dance on the table:. -shrimp tamale. -lobster tacos. -mashed potatoes. -salmon (sauce is way too sweet imo). -pork tenderloin (to be fair, i'm not a huge pork guy but I just wasn't as wowed as others have been with this). . For the entrees, you MUST try:. -coffee rubbed filet (i've eaten at over 30 steakhouses and this is my favorite)..... -NY steak: always perfectly cooked and incredible sauces. -rib eye (I just started crying while typing this). . Service has always been great when I've gone. I don't get why people lower their rating to 2 or 3 stars because their water didn't come fast enough. Get over it people. The food is delicious, the servers are usually busting their tails (you're in Caesar's Palace...that doesn't make you Caesar) and your'e in VEGAS! . . Definitely try this place. I can't say enough about it. We've tried maybe 8 other steakhouses in Vegas alone and we're always left wondering why we didn't just go back to Mesa
The service, food, and atmosphere were all truly amazing! Our recent dining experience at The Mesa Grill is one not to be forgotten. I can't wait to go back to Vegas just to eat here again! Every bite was bursting with flavor and I give Bobby Flay and his chefs major props! You won't regret anything you order here!
I was in Vegas in September 2013, and have been really wanting to try this place out for years. I went around 1pm on Wednesday. I sat at the bar and ordered the Green Chile Burger for $16. I must say, I was impressed with the flavor of the burger and it was woth the $16. My only regret is not ordering the Tiger Shrimp Tamale, I still think about it to this day. . I was talking with the bartender, I asked him if Bobby Flay comes out to check up on the place, and he said yes he does, about once every few months, he comes out with his crew, hangs out in the kitchen, just makes sure everything is going well.  I was like wow, he is still hands on with his business. Overall a good time, food quality is high, service was good, would love to go back and try some different items on the menu.
Amazing!  I went for brunch after being denied at Giada.  I'm so glad I did!  Everything was amazing...fundido, shrimp tamale, chilliquiles, Bloody Mary.  All delicious and the service was outstanding!  Highly recommend!!
Corn soup - oh my yum. And I really liked the chile relleno. Say yes to the Margarita and the bread!. . That said, here's a bit more detail:. The corn soup was creamy - crunchy (not sure what was in it, but it gave it a great texture) and delish! Perfect - could eat it all day. Margarita - also perfection, and their was a variety of bread - sweet and savory. . . After all this, I did still have room for my Chile Relleno. The breading was a little too hard / crunchy in my opinion, but it wasn't so off-putting that I didn't thoroughly enjoy what was underneath. . . We did not get dessert - the coconut cake was being touted as the "specialty".. . And that's where I think the negative is with Mesa Grill - there was far too much "this is our specialty" for every course. The menu is not overly huge, and I find it a little cheesy to be telling people what to choose (unless they ask!). I did not choose any of the "specialties" and I thought my choices were perfect. Also, the service was a bit too fast. It was fine, but it felt very much like there was a focus on turning tables as quickly as possible. Ambiance was typical of a Vegas celeb restaurant - in this case, very open and comfortable seating arrangements.. . I would go back for sure. I might even order the same thing, and perhaps try dessert!
Lobster Tacos!!! You must try!!!. Be aware...... they are not available on the lunch menu.... I was soooooo disappointed when I went back to get them again and couldn't......not available until 5:30??? ugh. I will make another trip just for those lobster tacos!!!
Was looking for a place to eat and came across Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. I'm a sucker for celebrity chef restaurants. One thing to note is that on the weekends, they only serve brunch and not a typical lunch menu. That being said, the brunch menu still has a good variety of breakfast and lunch options.. . For brunch, I ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. It was the perfect amount of spicy with the rich hollandaise sauce over the poached eggs and hash combo. It was a nice twist on the typical corned beef hash, with chicken as the meat and a switch to sweet potatoes. I would definitely recommend for a hearty breakfast that is much different from traditional options. . . Another favorite was the plate of mini breads, muffins, and scones that came complimentary before the meal. There was a chocolate scone, something that resembled a jalapeno cornbread, cheesy roll, all were delicious!
One of the best meals I've had in my life. I ordered the lamb porterhouse chops med rare. I received 2 steaks, one med rare and one was a bit thicker and probably closer to rare but not an issue for me. The blue corn tamale was also delicious. I ordered a house margarita and the blue corn duck pancake for an appetizer that were just ok. But the lamb blew me away. Amazing.
Had a great meal at Mesa Grill. I sat at the bar and ordered an appetizer and an entree. The bartender Donna was very nice and helpful in recommending drinks and food. I ordered The Mesa Grill Margarita and it was great! For an appetizer I ordered the Blue Corn Pancake with Duck and for the entree I ordered the Chile Relleno. Both were 5 stars! The food was a great representation of Bobby Flay's cooking style. I would recommend this restaurant to someone visiting Las Vegas!
AMAZING! I ate here for lunch and the food was excellent.. . I ordered: CORNMEAL CRUSTED CHILE RELLENO *Roasted Eggplant + Manchego Cheese Sweet Red Pepper Sauce + Balsamic Vinegar . . This meal was bursting with flavor. I loved it!!! I will definitely be back to explore the menu.
Typical Bobby Flay...he doesn't skimp on the flavor!  Lol!  I like the restaurant and the vibe, but for me personally, it's a bit overkill on the flavor.  Still, the quality of food is great!  Of course it's pricey....not only is it Bobby Flay's name behind it, but it's located in the heart of the casino!  We will definitely be back though!  Hands down!  Gotta love Bobby Flay, and the drinks are fabulous!!!  My husband loves the extra flavor, so he's all over it!!!
Was not disappointed with Mesa Grill. I had both brunch and dinner and was completely satisfied with the flavors and customer service at this establishment.  For brunch I had the Sweet Potato Chicken Hash with Poached Eggs. The green chile hollandaise sauce alone was divine.  The meal was substantial enough to suffice for a brunch.  The dinner I had the next day was the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. This dish comes with a side of a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter which I enjoyed the most.  The texture of bits of crushed pecan in the tamale was a nice surprise.
I've wanted to eat Bobby Flays food since the early days of FN when he had a NY accent thick as a 3" ribeye. It was a small job to find it in the maze Caesar's has become, but we were seated promptly and the people were nice. The decor was fun and we could watch the chefs at work through a window. I had a great margarita, then we had 2 appetizers, the shrimp and corn tamale and duck tacos. Both were tasty, especially the tamale, the duck perhaps a touch too sweet and chewy...still good! My husband then had the pork loin and loved it. It was spicy, but expected as the server explained it accurately. I had the Mahi with peppercorn sauce, and while it was good, it came out rare, not mecium rare, and then I had to wait while hub ate. I hate that. We also had the corn and loved it. Probably our favorite thing was the sweet potato tamale that came with his entree. The flavors were bold and deep, as they should be for southwestern fare. The dishes were very signature Flay. Thanks Bobby!
I can say that this place was a delightful experience. Came out to Vegas for a weekend with my ladies to celebrate a birthday, this place was the groups must have spot. We had made reservations for 8:30pm on a Saturday night before our late night shenanigans at Light. . . As soon as we enter, greeted by the hostess, taken to our table. We then met our waiter, James (he reminds me of an Asian version of the actor Terrence Howard). James was super sweet, charming, he told us the story of the Resturant.... It's owned by Bobby Flay, they are known for their margaritas, lobster tacos, shrimp tamales, lamb and pork entrees. I told him that my friend Viet Pham beat Bobby Flay on Iron Chef! He just smiled and recommended we start with a round of the house margaritas. Those drinks were definitely on point! Not too sweet, tart & strong- loveee! They provide a yummy assortment of bread in a basket, the best was the jalapeno cornbread muffin, the girls devoured them! James came by to check on us and was so kind to bring us more. I'm in love with the service James provided, he was knowledgable, gave great suggestions, was very direct and efficient - he knew how to handle a table of women! We all ordered the lobster tacos, shrimp tamales and had a side of grilled corn & twice baked potato. Everything was light, flavorful and delicious. We ordered another round of drinks! By this time we were craving something sweet! James recommended the banana pudding - my pick! The birthday girl didn't fancy banana pudding so she picked coconut cake to share with the table. James saw my sad face :( and he brought me a banana pudding anyways on him! Loveee him!! Lol. At the end of our meal, he brought out our check and 4 to-go cups to take our margaritas with us - to keep our party going. I love his thoughtfulness and his service is by far the BEST I have ever seen. . . Thank you James for your amazing service! Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm dining at Mesa Grill for sure. See our pic!
I was super hyped about trying Bobbly Flay's restaurant since I've been watching him on The Food Network for a very long time. We were a party of four and our bill (with tip) came to $400 and this is what we got... We loved the jalapeno bread in the bread basket but the jalapeno corn bread crumbled in our hands and was dry.. Sophie's cobb salad (good and different but I would not order it again).. Goat cheese dip (loved it). The regular margaritas were okay but the pear margarita was delicious.. New York strip steak was dry in the middle and my daughter-in-law left a lot of it on her plate and did not want to take any of it home.. Ribeye steak was not a good cut of meat at all.  It was gristly and had a lot of fat. My husband didn't care to eat all of it and said he's had a lot better at other places.. My son and I had the coffee rubbed filet mignon and it was excellent.. The sides are additional. . The twice baked potato was good.. The tamale was not very good and was not finished.. The corn and cilantro was pretty tasty.. . I so wanted to love this restaurant and am sad that I am compelled to write this review. We think that a fair price for the quality of food should have been about $150. The margaritas were very over priced and small as well.. . Our servers were pleasant and professional.. . I can now check this off my bucket list and we will not be going back.  :(
Made a reservation for brunch on a girl's trip to Vegas and was very excited to see what Mr. Flay had to offer. Grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party. Bloody Mary was good but simple and average, I think my expectations may have been a little high on that one. I also had the house margarita which was below average at best - it was so forward on triple sec I couldn't even finish it.. . We sit down, waiter comes, he was very nice throughout. We order and I tell him I would like the Chilaquiles but not with scrambled eggs. He tells me that I can't change the eggs in that dish or any other dish on the menu in fact. Since poached eggs are pretty much the kings of brunch, I was a bit surprised by this. He went on to explain that the dishes are prepared and put together specifically and changing the eggs would change the dish so they don't do it. Show of hands - who actually prefers scrambled eggs? People who are scared of runny yolks, sure, but people who actually enjoy eating eggs - I would venture a guess never order them scrambled.. . So I order the steak and eggs because it is the only way I can get none scrambled eggs. My friends order as well, a bread basket is brought and it is as delicious as everyone said. Then the waiting begins.. . We waited at least 25 minutes for our food. We waited so long that one in our party had to leave early to go to the airport. They gave us a small percentage off for the waiting. . . All in all the food was just average. My eggs were luke warm by the time we got our food and although the steak was good overall it wasn't anything special. Nothing that anyone got was really stood out.. . Maybe the limited, inflexible brunch menu hindered our experience but overall between that and the long wait for a restaurant that wasn't even full my experience at Mesa Grill fell far short of my high expectations.
All good, most options spicy which I loved more than my wife but she was able to combine an appetizer and a side for a good meal.
This food here is delicious. I have eaten here several times, and have never been disappointed. On any review that I give the most important thing is the food, and so easily this place gets 5 stars from me. The blue corn pancake and  the tiger shrimp tamale are excellent starters. The veal, lamb, and pork loin are all amazing. The service is excellent, and the staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. . One very important tip...make sure to make reservations in advance if going there for dinner on the weekends, it does get busy here.
