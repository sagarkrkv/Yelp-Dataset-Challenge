I'm a huge GR fan, so I was very disappointed to find that this namesake steakhouse had such mediocre quality. Presentation was definitely top-notch, at least before the food was served, but the wait time for our waiter to come by was pretty ridiculous. . . I've eaten at GR at the London in L.A. many times and have become accustomed to their rapid service and consistent flavor. I don't think I'll visit the steakhouse again, or any GR restaurant in Vegas (I tried BurGR, too and was very disappointed). . . For serving Wagyu and Angus prime steaks, I would expect a less bland piece of meat, especially for the ostentatious prices.
I am dining with a long life long friend from New Jersey with a hip problem and he is being refused service because he cannot put his feet on the ground is like must be elevated. Gordon Ramsay I hope you're proud of the service you are providing
I really wanted to like Gordon Ramsey Steak.  I went in with high expectations, but left slightly disappointed.  I sat at the bar and ate, as I was traveling for work.  The bartenders were all quite nice, and pleasant.  My order was simple.  A glass of Shiraz, the house salad, and the Beef Wellington.. . The Shiraz was fine.  A good pour by the bartender.  Nothing amazing, but it was good.. . The bread was good.  It was a good start to the meal.  There was a mushroom bread, and olive bread, and one that I couldn't understand.  I actually asked the server to repeat what type of bread itwas, but I still didn't get it.. . The Salad was underwhelming.  It had way too much dressing on it, and the the flavors were mediocre.  The lettuce was a bit soggy.. . What I was expecting to be the star of the meal, The Beef Wellington, was just OK.  The beef was good, but the breading on it didn't do anything special for me.  I felt as though the potatoes and the veggies could have been a little bit more plentiful on the plate.  It was good.  Just not Amazing.. . All in all, I would give the restaurant a 3.5 star rating.  However, one of my rules is that if nobody says "goodbye" when i leave, I take off .5 stars.  It is not a very difficult task, and should be a focus of all good restaurants.  In fact, when i left, there were 4 (yes FOUR) Hostesses standing out front.  Not one of them said "thank you" or "goodbye" to me.  It may be worth a try if you exhausted the other steak places in Vegas.  I may go back next time and try a regular steak instead.  However, for now, I'll say that Gordon Ramesy continues to disappoint me (Pub, Burger place, and now Steak).  Maybe i just need to lower my expectations....
Okay so EXCELLENT service and they actually let us sit upstairs this time. CL and I came here for the foie gras because the last time we were there, it was a big piece for each of us. This time it definitely shrank! It was still good. It was just about half the size? The server wanted to explain to us about all the parts of the cow but we heard it all the last time I was there.  We told him he didn't need to push the beef cart and waste his breath telling us about it. He tried to sell us on the tasting menu but us, knowing that we went there just for the foie gras said NO! I already knew what I wanted. CL had to read the menu. So I ordered the beet salad which was delightful and almost too pretty to eat. Also the foie gras appetizer which had two little buns in it filled with cream cheese. For my main course I had the shortribs which was SO good. OMG! The meat was so tender and juicy! CL had the foie gras that came with his medium cooked ribeye steak and the pot de creme. The ribeye was cooked to perfection. You do get a discount if you give them your total rewards card but no free desserts on your birthday. We asked for both sparkling water and still water. They weren't smart enough to leave the still water for me but instead I had to keep putting my glass out so that they could see it was empty.  Finally towards the end, the busser left the glass of still water for me.
I think that if your coming to Vegas you should try Gordon Ramsey Steak at some point in your visit.  I think that this is one of the better dining experiences in Vegas, even though it is really pumped up based on the fact that it has Gordon Ramsey's name on it.  I would bet that for every three star review that you see on this site, if that same person ate the same meal and had the same experience at any other steakhouse it would be a 4 or a 5 star meal.  People that come here expect the best meal of their lives based on the name, for some people GR Steak delivers.  For me it was a top 10 meal of my lifetime.  . . The drinks were fresh and flavorful.  Some great pours by the bartenders as well.  When you pay $14 for a drink you are hoping to be satisfied, and I was.  . . I ate the bone in rib eye and it was one of the better steaks that I have ever had.  We also had the mac and cheese, baked potato which was huge, along with some mushrooms.  Their signature desert was also incredible.  You will be super full by the end of dinner, but it is worth it.. . The service at this location was very interesting.  When you are first seated the hostess says something weird about a light that is Gordon Ramseys hands or something.  Very strange, but also unique.  Our server was pretty good, but we were also helped by someone named John B (can't remember his last name).  He said that he was a fairly new server assistant, but this guy made it a meal to remember.  He had a great personality, and knew everything about every course that was brought out.  He also recommended some great drink pairings.
Love everything about this place; from the ambiance, the way we were greeted & brought to our table; being provided with a display of different style red meats, to the quality & taste of foods.
Rough start to the dining experience. We were running about 10 minutes late and called to let them know. Hostess said they only hold reservations for 15 and if we didn't make it within the 15 minute window we would lose our table. She was a bit rude. Yikes!!! 4th of July in Vegas and navigating the walk from the mandarin to the Paris could be problematic.  But we did make it with 5 to spare. We discussed this policy with the general manager when we arrived and he confirmed what the hostess told us. Apparently there is no forgiveness on their policy even on the day of the year that has more peeps in Vegas than New Years (almost 335000). In fact he somewhat defended her but then apologized.  he did offer to make it up to us with dessert but that was the last we saw of him and when it came time to order dessert our waiter never made mention of the "free dessert".  . . Food was very good andservice was good but probably not to the standards one would expect in a gordon Ramsey property. Wife had filet and was cooked perfectly. I had ribeye also cooked perfectly. BUT,  nothing outstanding. Mastros in crystals was better.
Took my wife here for our anniversary, what a amazing experience. We totally went all out, Rib cap, Beef wellington with wine pairing, inns and gunn oak barrel, sticky toffee pudding.... Amazing! the asparagus soup was something out of a movie. Seriously perfection. On top of a amazing night of food and drink , Gordon himself was there, and talked with us for about 15 minutes. What a memorable 1st anniversary. Cheers!!
Toughest steak I have ever tried to cut into at a restaurant.. . Service: Fantastic.  Numerous people constantly asking us if we needed anything more.. . Bread:  Sparse but some of the best around.. . Baked Potato:  Large and good.. . Beef Wellington:  Very good (my wife's order).  A bit dry without any drizzle or au jus.. . Steak: Great taste but incredibly tough.  Had to hold fork with two hands and cut (saw) away with other? hand!!  I know there will be people who say I should have sent it back and in hindsight they are probably right.  But it was my wife's birthday and I did not want to bring up the problem in any way to put a negative spin on a pretty good evening (came from Jersey Boys show).. . My other opinion is that the guy bringing around the display of meat is a bit cliche.  I remember Chef Ramsey making fun of restaurants that have photos on their menu.  Well, probably 100% of the customers have seen a piece of raw steak.  When we asked the guy who had a long speech about meat a question......he looked puzzled and did not know the answer (easy question about the prep at this restaurant).. . It was fun being in a celebrity's restaurant.  Most of the food was good.  Most money I have ever paid for a meal for 2 people.
Amazing service and even better food! We got the "tasting menu" that walks through all of Chef Ramsay's signature dishes. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted delicious. Can't wait to go back!
Went with a group of 6 for my daughters birthday!  We had a reservation and were seated promptly!  We had various cocktails and each person exclaimed at how delicious they were and they all looked gorgeous!!  Each meal looked spectacular and mine was incredible.  The waiter was spectacular and explained menu item questions fully.  Very excellent waiter!!! We even got to meet Chef Christine from Season 6. She came out to our table, sat down & chatted and our waiter took a picture.  It was a total blast and we will definitly be back!!! EXCELLENT everything!!!
Came here with a party of 6 recently and we were all amazed by the caliber of the service & the quality of the food - despite our already very high expectations.. . The blue crab soup, beef wellington, complimentary bread, and toffee dessert were definitely the highlights. The salmon and bourbon creamed corn were also great but not too memorable in comparison to the first 4 mentioned. . . Our server was fantastic and my water was always filled. Add in a glass of red wine and a bottle of passion fruit tea and bf and I were so stuffed for the rest of the night. Overall, we had a fantastic experience and Gordon Ramsay Steak definitely lived up to our expectations. Will be back in the future to try their other steaks!
Took my wife here for our 4 year anniversary and it was absolutely delicious. Went all out of course, "when in Rome", and got that fancy steak.. whats it called? Wellington? . . ahhhhhhh so delicious. They warned us it would take 45min but we were in no hurry what so ever. Making the sitter wait an extra 45min was the least of my concerns.. . Before dinner, i was reading reviews about the dress code. Some people said they enforced the dress code, some others said they didnt. We dressed up anyways, but... just FYI. They do NOT enforce the dress code. The dude next to me had on cargo shorts. He probably had a hunting hat underneath the table. . . The venue was nice, presentation was nice, the atmosphere was a tad bit loud and the service was very pleasant. . . 2 thumbs up! Is it the best steak house though? errrrr.... Ruths Chris was pretty damn good as well. It's a toss up folks!
When I decided to take my Vegas vacation, I had to have at least one fine dining meal on the strip. I debated between a couple of options, but ultimately decided on Gordon Ramsay Steak at Paris. . . I had originally planned to dine at the restaurant on the second night of my trip, but on the first night Bouchon was closed for a private event, so I had to scramble. First world pains, I know. I decided to push up my reservation a day and the FOH was incredibly accommodating on such short notice. . . The restaurant itself is beautiful, from the Tube dividing the restaurant from the bar/waiting area to the light sculpture on the ceiling portraying Chef Ramsay's hands in motion. . . Service: Impeccable. Being such a long time ago, I don't quite remember the names of my servers, but they were incredibly polite, helpful and eager to please.. . The Food: I was torn between a beautiful steak on the cart that they dazzle diners with and the Hell's Kitchen Tasting Menu. Ultimately decided on the latter. . . Each course definitely had me smiling because of all the times I recall contestants on the show messing them up.. . Highlights were the scallops and risotto that were executed perfectly and the sticky toffee pudding. At that point, dessert was an after thought, but dish was unbelievable. . . Beef Wellington was also on point, but god, that sticky toffee pudding.... . Overall, I had a great experience at Gordon Ramsay Steak. The likelihood of dining there again is high, but there are so many places left on my Vegas list that I have to hit before I come back.
What else can I say but "absolutely amazing"??  I've been to my fair share of fine dining places, but this by far is my favorite.  . . Not only was the food outstanding, but it really was a show to just sit back and watch the staff do their thing.  All of them were hustling, busting their tails, it was like clockwork.  They take pride in service and it shows.
It's a little above average but not good. The highlight of the meal was probably the bread and the dessert.
I had been wanting to try GR's beef Wellington for some time.  Since we were in LV for 2 days, we made reservations.  The food was really good.  The beef wellington was as excellent as what I saw on the GR's TV shows.  My mom got the chicken.  We all tried it and it was possibly the best chicken we've ever tasted.  It was moist and flavorful.  My husband had a steak that was also perfectly cooked and tender.. . The lack of a 5th star is due to one issue with the service.  The waiter we had only talked to my husband.  He completely ignored my mom and me.  I asked a question and he just walked off.  He wouldn't even look at us.  It was quite annoying.  When he came around with the meat cart (another thing that looked a bit cheesy as that poor cart if being pushed around all night), he finally decided we existed.  At that point, it got a bit better which saved him from me requesting another waiter/waitress.  Also, after the initial order, other people came to our table to clear our plates, present the dessert menu, etc and they were all really pleasant.. . For dessert, we shared the sticky pudding as recommended by someone else on the staff...  It was delicious!
Of course this place is filled with hype, and I am not one to buy into the flavour of hype; nothing but empty calories. Both my brother and my father had chance to visit Gordon Ramsay Steak on different occasions and they both spoke the praises of this venue. Granted both of them are Gordon Ramsay fans so who can question their loyalty. The only true measure was to eventually try it myself. . . My wife and booked a reservation prior to our most recent trip in July of 2014 to Vegas. We actually were looking forward to this experience to see if everything measured up to the stories we had been told. The restaurant was busy and naturally our table wasn't quite ready so we were ushered into the bar area. This seems to be a common staging practice in many fine restaurants. We ordered a couple drinks that were absolutely amazing. Strawberry martini's prepared right before us and went down easy. Obviously fresh ingredients and a great amount of care went into mixing each drink,. . We, rather quicky, got our table and were given an opportunity to look at the menu. The offerings where tightly controlled and we did not feel overwhelmed. The table side meat presentation was very different and added to the mystique of the place; really showing a restaurant that wants to stand out. The waiter gave a great presentation on the meat selection and left us to make our final decisions. . . I ordered the New York Stip with bone in, and my wife had the Ahi Tuna. If you have ever been to a 4 or 5 star steak house you know that there are good steaks and there are great steaks. Not meaning to offer up any offence but there are many that will hold a steak from the Keg up as a standard. Try a steak from a place like Gordon Ramsay's and the bar will be raised; and it truly was. Now don't get me wrong I enjoy a great steak from the Keg as much as anyone, and no I cannot afford to eat at 5 star restaurants. Once a year we save up for a trip to Vegas and a part of that trip is to enjoy a really great meal. If there is one thing you should do is take some money and set it aside for a truly delectable meal. It is an experience that really can change your perceptions. . . Gordon Ramsay Steak did just that, it changed our perceptions. We felt the hype was truly in line with what was offered. We truly enjoyed the experience and I am confidant you will too, I highly doubt any item on the menu will disappoint. . . Give the hype a try! In this case it tastes wonderful.
Had a fabulous experience last night! I did not know what to expect. My boyfriend had wanted to go so off we went. I had been to his London restaurant about 10 years ago, but this one in Vegas is so much better.. We went with the tasting menu with the pairing and added the Pork Belly Appetizer and the Rib Cab steak which both were to die for.. The food was exceptional and the wines were equally amazing!!. . Service was too notch!. Decor is very trendy and fun!. Overall loved this place!!
Wow!  Everything from the hostess telling us the story of the light sculpture, to the ipads detailing the drinks, to the amazing food, made for one of the best meals I have ever eaten, and a memorable anniversary dinner.  Beef Wellington was to die for and we are still talking about the truffle mac and cheese. You have to finish up with the Sticky toffee pudding....it's an out of body experience!  Matt, our server, was friendly and knowledgeable and helped guide us through our experience.  No hesitation in giving 5 stars and will be back very soon.
Very underwhelmed today. Got the lobster wellington and the lobster dish does not taste as fresh or flavorful as when its cooked fresh off the shell.  My party got 6 beef wellingtons and the majority are disappointed.   One of the beef wellington even has tendon inside which made it extremely hard to chew.  . . Overall, this is an overpriced establishment and you are just paying for the Gordon Ramsay name.  It would be hard for our party to visit again.  Giving one extra side of the delicious sides.
Unfortunately my husband and I never even got the chance to eat here. We called about 5 days ahead to make a reservation for Saturday and were told the restaurant was booked. That was understandable; we waited a little too late to call as it was a last minute trip to The Strip. When we got to the Paris hotel, we decided to walk past the restaurant to check it out. My husband is in culinary school and is impressed with Gordon Ramsey's high standards of service. The line for us happened when we were outside the restaurant looking in. A couple walked past and the hostess at the stand outside asked them if they'd like reservations to eat there that night, on Saturday, when this couple didn't even approach the stand. With such high standards, we did not expect to be denied a reservation when they obviously had space available, as evidenced by the hostess asking passers by to eat there! Left us with a bad taste in our mouths; my husband was very disappointed. Won't be going to a Ramsey establishment any time soon. Ate at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar instead.
Family dinner at Gordon Ramsay was really nice....this one is at the Paris Hotel, which is also a really cool place.. Therestaurant is be very nicely laid out...loved the entrance and the decor was impressive.  Our server was so charming and very attentive...he explained all of the meat cuts with samples on their meat trolley...he also detailed out how the Wellington was prepared as well as all of the sides.. Since we wanted to try everything, we shared salads which they kindly split for us before serving...Caesar salad was simple and very good.  . I think the steak I had was called a top cut...it's the "lip" of the rib eye cut "the other way"...very soft and tender and tasty...all of their steaks are aged for a minimum of 21 days....other folks in our party had the 24 oz rib eye and the Wellington...I especially loved the yukon potatoes and mushrooms...other sides included the brussels sprouts, creamed corn and a baked potato.. We ordered a sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream and an apple tart for dessert along with French press coffee..... Service was excellent, atmosphere really nice and food delicious!....
Worth. Every. Penny! Even the bored hostess comments about the bar representing the Chunnel and the light fixture depicting Gordon Ramsey's hand movement couldn't distract from the AMAZING dining experience. . . The prime filet was perfectly seared, the asparagus had just enough parmesan, and the fingerling potatoes were perfectly cooked. To top it off, the sticky toffee desert with burnt butter ice cream was, as promised, a semi religious experience! Amazing!
The food is phenomenal.  My new favorite spot.
Perhaps my review is a reaction of over-hyped expectation.  I've had many tell me that Gordon Ramsay's Steak is the best steak house in Vegas, so my expectations were very high.  Overall, the food was very good, but I wasn't blown away.  . . The food was great, but nothing that "wowed" me as an experience.. Appetizers:  We ordered the pork belly (amazing) and raw oysters (definitely fresh and tasty). . Steaks:  Between the four of us, we ordered two rib-eyes, one filet, and one American Kobe Rib Cap steak.  All were great steaks, though the two rib-eyes and filet were all ordered medium-rare but each came looking three different "stages" of medium rare... the filet was closer to the rare side, one rib-eye was "the perfect" medium rare, and mine was closer to the medium.  Regardless, none of us was disappointed about getting a great steak.. . Service:  We had a waiter and bus-boy serving us for the evening.  Both did a great job taking care of us and checking in... not too often but also not leaving us long enough to feel like we were being ignored.  I'm not a service snob, by any means, but I've been to several other steak places in Vegas and there's something that's missing with the service here... it's something about the feel of the staff not being personable.  They seemed distant and it felt that when we tried to engage in conversation with the staff, they spoke to us as if they were being monitored.. . Overall... food was great, services was great, environment was nice (though loud)... but for the price we paid and the hype we had, I expected a different dinning experience, especially in Vegas where there are so many other places.  . . I'm glad I dined here to try it out but it didn't make me want to come back, especially with so many other places to try in Vegas.
Easily one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to.  The experience itself is a step above the experience at other steakhouses, from presentation to service.  Yes, the prices are steep here, but go to any Steakhouse on the strip and you'll be set back for around the same prices, but I really think the value is great here.. . Here the presentation is great.  Atmosphere is superb for a date.  Steaks get brought out to let you choose your cut.  Just great to see slabs of raw meat finely marbled before they're cooked.. . I got the bone-in 28 oz ribeye, which was cooked to perfection, Pittsburgh.  The steak was definitely top 5 I've had in my life, and I've eaten a lot of steak.  Now, quality control at a steak house isn't exactly an exact science, but I'd say you will most likely be having the same tier of steak I had.. . I highly recommend coming here and trying it out at least once for both the steak and experience.
Me and my friend wanted to go there for a long time now and soon as we got there the host was very nice to us and the server was very nice, the food was ok not what i expected but it was a fun experience.
I really liked the whole decor of the restaurant but to me it seemed too loud inside. The dress code was also really lax. I had a southsider cocktail which was pretty good but the second one I ordered was full of ice...I was bummed out I couldn't try the hells kitchen tasting  menu because my wife doesn't eat red meat and you need to have everyone at your table order the menu :(. Tried the beef wellington and it was cooked perfectly. The toffee pudding was a surprise and tasted really good.
Definitely lives up to its name of a celebrity chef, though I have to say it's more glitz than substance--I can get great steak at great prices back home, just without the hoop la la as in Vegas-style.. . As soon as we checked in with the hostess, or should I say 'multiple hostesses'--there were 4 at the front, one opened the door, while proceeding to follow another girl, who then passed us off  to a suit who walked us to a cool, semi-circle booth, and then where not just the another head waiter showed up, but his immaculate dressed bus boy/assistant as well.  Said they would be working as a team for us tonight.. . Guess someone's got to pay the bills lol.  And i haven't gotten into the decor, but it's what you expect from a high-end steakhouse.. . Ordered the Royal long bone ribeye, amazing tenderness & seasoning. For the sides, added the fingerling potatoes, bite-sized, felt a bit over-rated.  But the sauteed mushrooms were good, probably the only thing I'd order again.. . And yes, the sticky toffee pudding was deleesh.. . Customer service superb.. . Worth going again but it's not something I'd wait for.
I don't give five stars to steakhouses often . In fact i would give peter Luger in NYC only 3 stars. In Vegas I've tried pieros and del friscos, and would only give them 3.5-4 stars tops . Gordon Ramsay Steak gets a solid 4.5-5 stars, partly due to the hip trendy setting that's totally Vegas (not really wanting to see another dark paneled wall steakhouse reminiscent of the 1960s) , partly due to the excellent service , but mostly due to the fantastic steaks offered here. I had the American Kobe rib eye wrapped in bacon and it was fantastic . Can't wait to try the rib cap . They said it was only 8 ounces but I couldn't finish it and I can devour a 24 ounce porterhouse . Maybe it was the lobster chorizo appetizer or variety of breads that filled me up, but whatever it was, I have some delicious leftovers , such as the creamed corn and loaded baked potato . Id skip the lobster appetizer just to have more room for the sticky toffee dessert, which Is Epic, with its brown butter ice cream.  You'll pay a pretty penny here (we averaged $120/person ) but I don't mind if its worth it, esp considering I spent $100/person at Del Friscos and it was not worth it .  Surprised to find such a good steakhouse in a hotel . Try it and hope you'll like it as much as I did
I'm not sure if my review is skewed due to the hype and expectations of this to be the finest steak house in LV or all the TV shows Gordon is in.  One member of our party has an allergy to wheat/gluten.  We expected a highly rated restaurant such as this is would be able to accommodate as well as any other.   We were wrong.  Our waiter seemed to not understand what we were talking about with gluten free.   After getting the impression that he didn't really get it, and couldn't point out anything on the menu that we could order for the allergy we asked to speak to either a chef or manager who might be better able to help us.  He explained the chef would be too busy to speak with us but sent one of the managers.  The manager was more knowledgeable and pointed out several options that could be made to gluten free.  So we ordered based on his recommendations.  First the waiter comes up 10 minutes after ordering and lets us know that the chef has told him the brussel sprouts are cooked off earlier in the day and can't be made gluten free.   So we order a different side.  When the entrees arrive we find the Fish that was supposed to be gluten free - the sauce was not, so they left it off entirely.  This would have been nice to know ahead of time instead of here's everyone's food you have some plain fish.  The beef wellington another party member ordered was overcooked.  We didn't send any of it back because we had a show to catch and wouldn't have time for it to be redone.  We did pass on our experience to the manager who checked in after we were done eating.  All in all, most food was delicious, but he experience left a lot to be desired for the price paid.
I actually enjoyed the food. My friend had the beef wellington-5 stars! I had the rib eye steak, so huge but delicious. I added a sauce which was a bone marrow in red or white wine. Pretty good but a little salty. The restaurant lives up to its' name. The setting is pretty dark and red inside.. Their service was excellent! Someone is always making sure you enjoyed your food and pouring water for you when your cup gets emptied or half full. . . TRY the beef wellington, brussel sprouts (has bacon in it)  & mac & cheese! The 3 best combo & for appetizer their lobster.. haha JUST TRY IT!!
All I could think of is the following abbreviation ... FFF (Fury for Flavor).. . Special note on decoration: The red neon sculpture on the ceiling represents Chef Ramsay's hand movements as he prepares the Beef Wellington.. . Special note on tasting menu: There was the Hell's Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu (Scotch Egg, Potato and Octopus Salad, Scallop Risotto, Beef Wellington, Sticky Toffee Pudding - $145 per person + additional $75 for wine pairings). If you are looking for Chef Ramsay's scallop, you will have to order the tasting menu because scallop is not on the regular menu.. . Once we were seated, our waiter immediately gave us the iPad with wine and cocktail menus. A moment later, meat / steak cart suddenly appeared as our waiter explained different cuts of meat.. . The overall service was exceptional with one minor hiccup. One of waiter was about to serve Kurobuta pork belly, but later he realized that blue crab soup was supposedly come out first because that was technically what I've requested. Not like I cared about which dish came 1st, but the waiter took the pork belly back to the kitchen and we basically had to wait another 15+ minutes for the soup to come out. . . Breads - Free Refills (Lemon Focaccia w/ Olive Oil, Black Truffle Mushroom w/ Pancetta + Pork Fat, Baguette w/ Blue Cheese, Butter w/ Volcanic Sea Salt) - Black truffle mushroom bread was amazing, baguette was decent, and lemon focaccia was average. Sea salt butter was one of the smoothest butter I've had.. . Blue Crab Soup (blue crab, corn, red curry - $17 Total Rewards Member, $18 Regular Price) - Creamy texture with a bit of sweetness, sourness, and spiciness all in one bowl. Full of flavors and a pretty good soup. . . Kurobuta Pork Belly (cheesy grits, tomato jam, onion pork jus - $18 Total Rewards Member, $19 Regular Price) - Pretty good pork belly (some portion of meat was melt-in-your-mouth good), but all that tomato jam and onion pork just didn't enhance the overall flavor of pork belly.. . Fingerling Potatoes (parmesan, truffle - $11 Total Rewards Member, $12 Regular Price): It has this very interesting roasted flavor - did not regret this order.. . Roasted Beef Wellington (medium rare w/ 45 minutes wait, glazed root vegetables, potato puree, red wine demi-glace - $99 for 2 Total Rewards Member, $101 for 2 Regular Price) - This should be the best order right? Well ... not at THAT price level. Well seasoned beef with flaky golden crust - so I could see the appeal, but I still prefer the traditional juicy cut steak. . . Sticky Toffee Pudding (sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, brown butter ice cream - $13 Total Rewards Member, $14 Regular Price) - Ho, ho ho! Definitely best order of the day. Such an amazing dessert ... and brown butter ice cream was the BOMB! One of the hardest ice cream to cut with a spoon, so I just stabbed it with my fork and took one bite at a time. Simply the right sweetness and texture for pudding cake - man, so amazing. . . Over-hyped prices, pretty good appetizers and the Beef Wellington, and out-of-this-world sticky toffee pudding. Probably not worth $300 meal (for 2 or 3) because I am pretty sure you can get better food with that kind of money, but it is still not a bad choice for the special occasion (or your are simply a Gordon Ramsay's fan and say "I've visited his restaurant ... at least once in my lifetime!").
Expect $100 per person.  The steak is good.  Exterior is crusty.  Interior is juicy.  Don't bother ordering more sauce.  The steak itself is good enough with no sauce.  We tried three stakes.  The two they recommend were good.  The other is wasted money.
I will start by saying that the food is good.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was flavorful.  And I love the breadthat they serve before the meal.  The prices are comparable to other restaurants of its caliber... expensive.  But, I don't mind paying for a good meal.  The service was very good, and our server was polite and helpful.  The biggest downside to me was the ambiance.  I'm glad I was with a friend and not a date.  It was EXTREMELY LOUD.  It reminded me more of a dance club with the techno music and off-putting decor.  It looked more like a cafe, than a four-star restaurant.  For someone who has transformed many failing restaurants, he could sure use some help in this one with the music and the decor.  Also, it is CRAMPED in there.  The tables are all too close together.  Like I said, I could barely hear from friend from the loud music and all the people that were sitting way too close to us.  Great food, but there are better places here in Vegas.
4.5 stars. . You're going to think we live under a rock, but neither of us really knew who Gordon Ramsey was walking into his steakhouse. I prejudged the restaurant, assuming it'd be unnecessarily expensive (correct) and overhyped/not that good (incorrect) given the celeb chef name attached to it (past experiences.). . Biggest eye-roll moment: when our hostess pointed to the red light sculpture on the ceiling & proclaimed it represented GR's hand movements as he made his infamous beef wellington. Pretentious & laughable. . . Our booth was intimate, perfect for our almost 3-hour dinner. . . Upon getting settled in, we were given an iPad to help us choose our alcohol/cocktails. I opted for a glass of riesling on their wine list. . . I like the intriguing contrast between old school touches and modern detail; i attribute outstanding service and the visual aid of bringing out the meat cart to old fashioned food industry techniques. It paired nicely withthe technology at our fingertips & the EDM playing. . . Foods:. -- bread selection was phenomenal. We commented how its uniqueness piqued our interest. The truffle bread & the blue cheese ones were particularly delicious, but can't complain about lemon rosemary brioche or bacon bread! . -- creamed corn: sweet & strangely addictive. -- baked potato: too many fancy toppings...smoked gouda sauce, GTF outta here! I would've preferred good ol' sour cream & chives.. -- filet: butterflied, perfect temperature, generously seasoned, tender. Absolutely delicious, definitely in my top 5 favorite filets. . . Biggest eyes-rolling-in-the-back-of-my-head moment: dessert. Sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream fashioned to look like a stick of butter. Mind equals blown. Describing it wouldn't do it justice. Suffice it to say, dinner here wouldn't be complete without an order. . . I still haven't seen any Gordon Ramsay shows, but I definitely know who he is now: a guy whose got almost 300 of our dollars, but who gave us a superb dining experience in return.
I ordered the 8 oz filet medium well with Mac and cheese and fingerling potatoes! My steak melted in my mouth like butter very juicy and cooked to perfection! The beer I had, Seef, amazing! Very romantic atmosphere as well!
Currently eating at steak. We got seated promptly everything was going well except that our food took like an hour to be served. I even took a nap! I ordered the chicken plate, it was ok the flavor was similar to Chipotle Mexican grill chicken. Not bad but I expected more from this place. The bakedpotato was ok too the pork belly on top of it is delicious!! The steak was good although one of the steaks was rare instead of medium rare but I guess that's always debatable. My friend got the sliders she was happy with them. She also ordered a mixed drink was delicious and outstanding! The staff was very prompt to get my plate to me after the long wait. But it was not very enjoyable I would have preferred to go somewhere else especially for the price being paid for these plates. This place is ok, just don't order the chicken it is not worth the price or time u have to wait to receive the food. Definitely skip this place! It's not all that and a bag of chips!!
I didn't know food could taste this good! I was so impressed with the overall experience at Gordon Ramsay Steak. We had made reservations and were promptly seated when we arrived. We were greeted by our server Charles and well taken care of. We decided to splurge and partake in the "Hells Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu" as well as the pairings. It consisted of a scotch egg, potato & octopus salad, scallop risotto, roasted beef wellington, & a sticky toffee pudding. WOW! It was like I was punched in the mouth with awesome flavour when I tried my first bite of the scotch egg. The only part of the meal that was not amazing was the potato and octopus salad, too much mustard vinaigrette. At any other restaurant, and not paired with so much delicious awesomeness, it would have been great. The pairings with each meal was worth the extra price and the sommelier was supper friendly and knowledgable. She really knew her stuff! I think I am ruined for food after this experience. . . If you want to see what real service and great food is all about I suggest that you try this restaurant.. . Link to a photo of my menu (they let you keep it): http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=pesHqvnnIS9mPx2TM2nUdA#pesHqvnnIS9mPx2TM2nUdA
Went there with my husband. Awesome experience and probably one of the best meals of my life.. Cheesecake desert is heavenly!
WOW!  Just what Las Vegas didn't need was another steakhouse.  But this one is going to be around for a long time.  Very impressed with the menu, the restaurant is absolutely stunning, the food was great and the service was TOP NOTCH.  Nothing better than 4 people clearing your table of 4.  All around, a fantastic steakhouse with a lot to brag about..   . Personally, I was not as impressed with the beef wellington as I had hoped, maybe it was too much hype.  But the steaks were amazing, the desserts were awesome, the sides were delicious... overall, a fantastic steakhouse and a great dinner.  I recommend the wagyu rib cap cut, amazing. . . Saving my money so I can go back again soon!
Let me be honest.  The beef wellington was aight.  But the ribeye, free high-end bread, appetizers and desserts (sticky toffee pudding and ice cream)....i would trade anything to eat this again.  I don't even mind Ramsay just yelling at me for hours if it means I can taste his ribeye again.
I was pretty happy about this Steakhouse (overall). I give it 3.5 stars, rounded to 4. Still hasn't hit the 5 star yet, due to the pricing of the food. Don't believe it's worth the value.. . My husband and I double dated with another couple and our bill came out to about $800 (averaging $200 per person) - kind of a hefty price tag for steak, if you ask me.. . HOWEVER, what makes this place stand out amongst the others was how formal and how professional they presented everything. Right off the bat, after the hostess walked us into the restaurant, we were given a tour of the restaurant (gorgeous decor, by the way!) and seated upstairs in a quiet room. Our server - and assistant duo were also very friendly, attentive, and great with us. (forgot their names though, unfortunately).  They really wanted to help and I appreciate how their main goal was to focus on us.. . They also did a presentation on a cart with all the different steaks, which helps clarify the different styles. I LOVED that!!!. . We ended up each ordering a steak, some sides, and appetizers to start -- which included the bone marrow (yum!) and others which I can't remember on the top of my head. The bone marrow was rather delish -- never expected myself to like Bone marrow!. . Also I thought it was professional that the "drink" menu was to be ordered on the iPad. I think that's very progressive thinking. Loved those parts of the restaurant and it makes it unique.. . . Overall, my steak and food were good. Would recommend if you're ok with spending $200/per person easy and enjoy delicious food and service.
Seriously one of the best meals I've ever eaten. Ordered the Wellington, chorizo stuffed lobster tail, onion soup, green salad & rib eye. All absolutely amazing! Service was awesome place was cool worth every penny. If you are havin hard time thinking prices are high it's def worth it. Will go back my next Vegas trip!
The steak was extremely good. Cooked to perfection. The server was amazing!  Reservations are a must if you don't want to eat in the lounge area. Would highly recommend this as a must while in Vegas.  You will not be disappointed.  Also, they have a very good selection of drinks. From mild to wild. Great atmosphere too. Your wish is their command.
Oh Gordon Ramsay, how I secretly love your ballistic rantings to sub par kitchen staff on television! And I also love your food!. . My recent trip to Vegas was highlighted by an excellent meal at Gordon Ramsay Steak, where the service was BEYOND excellent and the food, delicious! There were so many layers of flavors going on, my palate was desperately trying to figure out how they could work so well together. . . First let's address the service. We had an 8pm reservation and were told to wait in the bar while our table was being prepared. When I saw my favorite tequila Clase Azul behind the bar,  I knew I was in a for a treat here, so naturally that's how I started my visit. We were seated about 5 minutes later in an upstairs table overlooking the main restaurant and our server was there within 2 minutes to greet us. And after that point, I don't believe there was a 15 sec period of time where someone from the wait staff or maitre de were not walking by quietly observing our table to make sure we had everything we needed. It was amazinghonestly. My partner was a bit clumsy and dropped his knife. Two minutes later a new knife appeared. He dropped his spoon an hour later, boom, new spoon and napkin. Great service indeed!. . The food now is a whole new topic because frankly it was divine. I started with a  lobster sausage appetizer and my partner had the blue crab soup. Both were excellent and the soup had a small amount of "heat" to it, not overwhelming but just enough for a little kick. Next up I decided to go with the Gordon classics, Beef Wellington while my partner had a NY Strip and two sides. Mac and Cheese and the most incredible Brussels Sprouts I think I've ever tasted. I had to ask the waiter how they were made and he revealed they were finished with bacon and apple cider vinegar. Nice!  The beef wellington was excellent as was my friends steak. But the absolute star of the night is the Sticky Toffee Pudding, another of Gordon's classics. Holy Mother Mary of God! The cake was light but filled with the most delicious toffee sauce I've ever tasted! Do yourself a favor and save room for this dessert because it is worth every calorie!. . This is truly a special night out meal when you're in Vegas, and surprisingly since we didn't order wine and only had a few cocktails the meal was not that expensive considering where you are dining. But of course I'm coming from a NY cost of living mentality so bare that in mind, but this is definitely a place I'll book again.
Heard a lot of great things about this restaurant going into this meal.  I was unsure if the reviews for his restaurants were being based off of his popularity as a TV personality.  This had me a little worried.  The meal turned out to be pretty spectacular. I had the kobe rib cap and my husband had the wellington.  We share some potatoes.  The steaks are of top notch quality and executed perfectly.  The rib cap I had never come across on another menu so I wanted to give it a try.  Very interesting cut, it has the buttery  goodness of a filet but the marbling and flavor of a rib eye. Outstanding.  He also really knows how to cook potatoes.  I'm a potato snob (if there is such a thing)  he does it right.  They have a pretty solid Strawberry Martini on the menu as well. I would definitely go back if there weren't so many options in Vegas.   The one downside to my meal (husband also agreed), there is a section in the back left of the restaurant, it's almost like a little hallway. We were seated in this area.  Lets just say that the tables are very close together and I got a lot of the waiters ass is my face.  Made the experience uncomfortable.
Absolutely love this place!  The food was everything I had hoped for.  I decided to try the Beef Wellington,  after watching his show Hell's Kitchen for years I wanted to see if it lived up to the hype.  I was not disappointed!   The beef melted in my mouth and the flavors were perfect without being over powering.  Looking forward to going back!
We've been here 3x and will still come back for more. The place is awesome, steak made perfectly right to your satisfaction.
Everything you expect is normal at a high end steak house.  Greeted by an army of hostessesand one walks you to your table.  Now this is when the restaurant fails.  A waiter turns from another table and taps on our table and says "I will be right there."   So we sat for 15 minutes with no menu, no beverages, and a fully staffed restaurant and were basically ignored.  I couldn't take it anymore so I had to get a different waiter from the other tables to help us.  The guy was great and very knowledgeable.  30 minutes later our original waiter comes by during our appetizers and did the meat cut showing.  He says it's part of the experience of being there.  So I guess the experience is ignore your customers, show me raw meat during my eating and show me cuts of meats after I have already ordered.  Then came the biggest disappointment of the night, my rib eye boned in piece of leather.  The meat was so tough, you have to saw into it just to eat.  I never sawed into a medium rare steak ever in my life.  I asked for a sharper knife but they only carried cerrated butter knives at this steak house.  I do recommend the coffee, it was excellent.  Dinner for two $350 bill for good coffee.  By the way, the beef Wellington, the crust is supposed to be flaky not soggy.  Will not recommend or return to this place.  For a guy that prides on running a restaurant correctly, this was such a failed experience.
My husband and I did not like the service. I think the server tried but I think we didn't have good attention because we were seated upstairs. It's very awkward for the servers because the kitchen is downstairs. They have to constantly go up and down for every little item. The waiter brought up our drinks and realized he forgot the straws and said he would be back with them. It took 5 minutes to come back.  We were seated for almost 10 minutes before given a menu.  It's weird that the hostess who seats you doesn't hand out the menus.  My husband had to flag down a different waiter to place our order.  We ordered blue crab soup, pork belly and oysters as appetizers.  We ordered the  beef Wellington and bone in ribeye along with mushrooms and Brussels sprouts and the bone marrow.  My husband says his ribeye was so tough he had to "saw" his way through.  The crust on my beef Wellington was soggy!  The filet inside was cooked well and was tender.  So I ate the inside and left out the puff pastry.  Very disappointing. The Brussels sprouts were tasty but undercooked and hard to bite into. Bone marrow was rich as expected but nothing extraordinary. Mushrooms were earthy.  Pork belly was good.  Dessert, I ordered the sticky toffee pudding. It's not really pudding but a date cake with toffee syrup. It was probably the only fantastic thing I had that night.  Everything else was just average.
Came here with my family and our overall experience was great. Their service is #1, our waiter was extremely patient with us because we were very indecisive. One of the cool thing we loved was the part when he showed us all the different types of meat. The food was pretty good, would come back!
This is an over the top unique restaurant..that "nails" it on almost everything....and I'm giving it yelps highest grade...but I'm not certain I'd ever return. Its almost an exhausting gastronomic experience....I walked away from here completely satisfied....very very full.....yet almost mentally drained. Its a really happening place.  Its noisy...dark..hustle-bustle. we didn't really care for the atmosphere...not relaxing at all....our table was very close to the waiters pick up station..constant commotion going on.... the food is off the charts terrific...... .Christopher,our waiter, was very very good. Knew the ins and outs of the menu. Even in the frenzied atmosphere he took the time to walk us through everything we needed to know. Drinks are robust and made perfectly. the bread is almost a meal onto itself....he explained what we were getting.....soooo good! as apps...the british ale onion soup,the blue crab soup and the Caesar salad got high grades. My wife had the fishermans grill/lobster,mussels and scallop mix and loved it. my son,daughter  and I each had the roasted beef wellington...fantastic! Christopher explained twice why we didn't want beef wellington for 2..so we each had our single portion. you can't make this at home! mac and cheese side dish was fabulous. you must save room for the sticky toffee pudding for dessert..we shared....almost puts you in a sugar induced coma. All this comes at a high price but we all left here happy. this is definitely NOT your fathers old stodgy steakhouse.
The Wellington was everything I could have hoped it would be and everything else we had far exceeded any expectations we had! We started with the chorizo stuffed lobster, then had the Wellington with the sauteed spinach, and a baked potato that now raised the bar on how perfectly a potato can be done. For dessert we had the highly recommended sticky toffee pudding and it was the perfect ending to such a delicious meal. The only downside? I don't think many places can even come close to cook a steak or piece of meat like this place. . . Loved.
We started our night off with the Maine Lobster that was stuffed with Chorizo. So Amazing!  The sauce was so good I would eat any vegetable if it was dipped in that sauce!  The lobster was so tasty.  The bread that was brought out after out appetizer was really good and the butter with the salt on it was also delicious. We then had the beef Wellington. Worth. The. Wait. It says 45 minutes to cook but it really didn't feel that long at all. The beef was cooked perfectly and it just melted in your mouth. The baked potato side was so good with the Gouda cheese on it. The star of our night was the sticky toffee pudding!  So amazing!  I could eat that desert all day long it was so good. If I wasn't so full I would have probably had another!  Highly recommend!!!!
5 th visit here, my wife and I really enjoy this place. The Food is allays top quality, Meets & Seafood. We have even done the tasting menu. This is differently not the place to go if you want a quick steak. Its more of experience to be savored. the wait staff is on point to make recommendations on everything from appetizers and wines to the well presented coffees and deserts. If you are considering a night out with friends and the food and service need to be top shelf. This is the place.
After hanging out by the pool all afternoon, my man and I were really looking forward to a good meal. We're avid fans of Gordon Ramsay's tv shows so Steak was definitely on our must-eat list for this trip to Vegas! We didn't get there until nearly 10pm so we assumed our best bet was sitting at the bar and ordering from their bar menu. We walked in and there was also a cute "dining" area in the bar area which was mostly full (the dining room wasn't full at all at this time of night). We sat down in the bar area and much to our surprise we were able to order from the full menu! Our server was really helpful, gave us great recommendations on steak (he got the American Kobe Rib Cap and I got the American Kobe Filet, both excellent!). We ordered the gnocchi and the pork belly to start, the gnocchi had really great flavor and the pork belly melted in your mouth. With our steaks, we split the Mac and cheese. It was perfectly cooked but had blue cheese in it. We may not have ordered it if we had full read the ingredients, but it was still very tasty. Lots of cheese and not too saucy. We looked at the dessert menu, but after such an amazing meal we were too full! But the couple next to us ordered the sticky toffee pudding and it looked delicious, just like something I've had in England! . One nice touch that we both appreciated, was that the wait staff gave a full explanation of your food as they served it to you. Everyone was very friendly and answered all our questions about Gordon Ramsay. Haha :) . My parents dry age their own steak, so I know how nice and tender a steak can be and both of our steaks really exceeded my expectations. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good steak and a nice dining atmosphere.
I have been meaning to try Gordon Ramsay's Steak for some time now and finally got the opportunity this past weekend. Everything about our experience here was exceptional. We were greeted at the hostess stand and only had to wait a few minutes before we were seated. There were a fewother diners waiting with us that seemed to think shorts, t-shirt and sandals are appropriate for "business casual" and I was happy to see the head host approach them about it. I understand that it's 110 degrees in Vegas in the summer, but don't go to a fine steakhouse in your gym clothes people. . . After we were sat in a quiet room upstairs, we were greeted moment later by our server Shaun, who was delightful and attentive throughout the whole meal. His suggestions were on point and really added to our experience. There were three people in our party and we all decided to try something different and pass a few tastes around the table.. . A few comments on the drinks; We started the evening with some cocktails. We tried the Vesper, the Sidecar and a third drink I can't remember off hand. All the drinks were well made and really not all that expensive considering the quality of liquors used. We had a bottle of wine to do with dinner as well. I'm a big fan of Bordeaux, which the wine list had in spades. Both Shaun and the Sommelier had some brilliant suggestions and the wine we ended up getting was excellent at a good price point. The Sommelier knew the encyclopedic wine list like the back of his hand and shared a few interesting facts with us about the particular vineyard we chose. . . A few comments on the food; Wow, truly exceptional. The bread service had an interesting spread of choices from a foccacia to brioche which was a real treat. We ordered the pork belly and the gnocchi as an appetizer,both of which were phenomenal. For our entree we ordered the signature beef wellington, the 24oz dry aged ribeye, and a dry aged filet. The Wellington easily lived up the hype and was a favorite at our table. The ribeye was absolutely incredible and cooked to perfection. The filet could have benefited from a sauce in my opinion, and there are several options for that on the menu, we just didn't order anyway. We also ordered the fingerling potatoes, mac and cheese and the creamed corn. All three were excellent, however our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we could not finish them. Despite being stuffed to the gills, we still ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding and boy are we glad we did. It was a great cap to an already extraordinary meal. . . The whole experience, start to finish, was a wonderful experience all around. My praises to the entire crew at Steak for running a restaurant worthy of Gordon Ramsay's name. Thank you for the incredible effort and pride you put into your work.
We all know Gordon Ramsey. The ill tempered celebrity chef from England made a name for himself. When I think of him, he isn't smiling or laughing. I think of angry eyes, wrinkles on the forehead, and fire coming out of his mouth. That imagery to me, is more laughable than scary. But truly, Gordon Ramsey did make a name for himself, literally. The guy names his restaurants after his name. Gordon Ramsey at The London, and this blog post, Gordon Ramsey Steak at Paris. You must be pretty full of yourself if you name your restaurants after your first name. If Gordon Ramsey has the audacity to put him name (again, literally) on his restaurants, he must be pretty confident in it. With that kind of thinking, I expect top notch flavors and cuisine.. . Ramsey's vision to transport you to the U.K. is accomplished through the "English Channel." This is exactly what it does. You are transformed from Paris to the UK, just like the real thing! The inside really does transport you to England. The red accents and obviously, the U.K. flag gave it that ambiance.. . Another thing that was cool was the beverage selection. The menu is on an iPad and guests can swipe through craft beers, wines, and cocktails. The price and drink description are all available. This was an experience in itself, which probably pushed me to order the Primm's Cup.. . The night started with a cocktail. The Primm's Cup was the cocktail of choice. It had Primm's No. 1 and sparkling lemonade. It had a complex flavor and wasn't too sweet. It was spicy and had a fruity citric flavor. I wanted something with a little bite so that it went well with a steak. The Primm's Cup wouldn't be my first choice if it was enjoyed alone. For a meal though, I think this was a successful choice.. . We were given complimentary bread. This was a good start -- it was some of the best and most flavorful of restaurant complimentary breads. There was walnut bread; lemon, thyme, and olive focacia; and pancetta and mushroom truffle bread roll. This was accompanied with and English Devonshire butter with sea salt. If not the bread, this butter was amazing. It had a cheese like consistency and flavor. My ultimate goal now was to find English Devonshire butter back in L.A. A "shmeer" of this stuff on the bread was purely exceptional. The pop of the sea salt and the creamy butter was purely eventful in my mouth. Sometimes, all a man needs is good butter and good bread. This was surely a great start.. . Another item I wanted to start off with was the bone marrow. A personal favorite at any restaurant, I was happy to see it on the menu. The fatty bone marrow on the crostini was delightful. The chimichurri was zesty and added the acidity to the dish. It was a perfect flavor meld of fat and fat.. . The waiter came to our table with a display of steaks. All of the steaks were real, and displayed to show texture, and marbling. This was nearly useless to me as I was going to order the beef Wellington, but useful to others not knowing what to order. Table side presentation of steaks, as Wolfgang Puck's CUT does it is an added wow factor. It is cool to see your steak as is before its cooked off.. . My main dish of course, was the roasted Beef Wellington. Being Gordon Ramsey's signature dish, I was overly excited to try it. Seeing up and coming, "red team, blue team" contestants mess this up time and time again, it was almost like a super star. The beef was cooked perfectly to a medium rare, and soft as ever can be. The beefy flavor was enhanced by the duxelles (mixture of minced mushrooms, onions, shallots, herbs, and butter) inside the flaky crust. Sitting on aside some root vegetables, potato puree, and a red wine demi glace, the entire dish was savory to a great degree. Steakhouses are one of many in Vegas, and the typical bone in ribeye was getting boring. I am glad I ordered and tried the Beef Wellington. Surprisingly, I liked it. Beef Wellington form Gordon Ramsey can now be checked off from the bucket list.. . A perfect side dish was the mac and cheese. This may be one of my favorite mac and cheeses of all time! The combination of cheddar, blue cheese, parmesan, and truffle made this perfectly balanced taste. The cheese blend was unctuous and the noodles had a perfect texture. I normally prefer the southern style man and cheese -- the one that is custardy and cheddar molested. Gordon Ramsey Steak's mac and cheese impressed me a lot. I would take this over any other mac and cheese out there.. . Another dish I couldn't pass up was the Maine lobster. The chorizo stuffed Maine lobster was poached in butter. To top it all off, it sat in a pool of brandied lobster cream sauce. The lobster was cooked perfectly and had a nice chew to it. The chorizo wasn't overpowering, and the lobster just shined. The rich butter and cream sauce was decadent and flavorful. I as expecting a small lobster piece of a tail, but it was quite large. Screw the steak! I'll just eat this for protein.
Wow is about all I can say. Great service and fantastic food, everything we had was top notch. Try the Beef Wellington, it's their signature dish and it's fantastic.
Inside Caesar's Palace, Gordon Ramsey's Pub is a great place for some grub. The hamburger was delicious and the T-Bone was better than anything I had in Utah and I loved every piece of red meat in Utah. Two thumbs UP!
Fourth visit. Initially, excellent food. Great sliders. Amazing steaks and salmon. Potato puree that I would have previously called the best in world was overly watery. Sticky toffee pudding still one of best desserts on planet. Service slightly stilted. Had to get waiter's attention to let him know we had need finished eating for 10-15 minutes and request dessert menus. A forgotten drink. Coffee served after dessert finished. But still would have been solidly 5 stars. Got check. Wife immediately noticed check was wrong (regular prices instead of total rewards (Caesar's program) but check indicated Total Rewards discount applied at top. I assumed because discount indicated at top she was wrong. But as we left she pointed out prices on menu on marquee. I then had to walk back in on principle (550 bill vs. 530 bill). First, he argued with me (but I got definite sense he knew...waiter at a restaurant of that calibre is aware of menu pricing) then conceded. Then deferred to manager. Who then had me wait 13 minutes. I got tired of waiting. Approached manager and asked if we could speed it up (wife and kids outside waiting) and snapped my fingers in a 'can we speed it up motion.' Response was 'don't snap your fingers at me! We are working on it.'  No apology. Defrauded me out of 18 bucks, but I am the jerk. Get money. Left. Never an apology. . Really spoiled expensive meal. You would think Ramsay wouldn't tolerate this. I will not. Plenty of places on strip I can drop 600 hundred plus on a meal. Oh well. Check your bill.
Went to Gordans steakhouse with the family and friends. Food was really good but quite expensive. Service was great and the restaurant was beautiful. Most Everything is a la carte. It was really cool When they brought out a meat cart and present the different cuts of steak they offer. . . We had a big party and had to split a check for our family and they really messed it up. He said it was ok to tip in cash and charge the rest of the bill onto the credit card. We were charged for tip on our credit card after we gave the waiter cash for the tip. We called the restaurant and had to get it fixed. It all could've been avoided if he had remembered to take the gratuity out of the total. I guess we all are human and make mistakes. All in all I Wouldn't mind coming here again.
Pimm's cup is really great. My sister and I shared a 8oz filet and Maine lobster, both tasty.
Okay. I won't go into detail about our entire experience, but I will point a few things out that I would like to have known pre-dining. We had a reservation and I am glad we did. This place was packed. We sat upstairs, right next to the staircase so we were able to not only look over the entire room, but we got to watch the food servers struggle to carry all of the foodup the stairs for every table on the second level. Very entertaining. This place is open and loud and the club music that is piped-in only adds to the noise level. When your waiter asks if you would like a bottle of sparkling or plane water you may also opt for a bottle of house or tap water. We were not given the third option, but when asked if we would like a second bottle I asked about the different looking bottle that sat on a few surrounding tables and was informed that that way "just tap water", to which I replied "We will have one of the tap waters". Not a big deal, its done everywhere but GR bottled water is 8 bucks a bottle. That cuts into my cocktail budget. Our apps and steaks were perfect. We each ordered an addition of marrow for our steaks. One would have been enough for both of us. Kinda felt like the Fintstones with two BIG plates of at least 4 marrow bones, 4 to 5 inches each squeezed onto our 2 top with cocktails, entrees, bottle of water (tap) and water glasses. Server was a bit robotic, but the well prepared food was good enough to overcome that flaw. Pricey as expected. A great meal all around.
This was everything I expected...absolutely the best. Beef Wellington is a MUST HAVE! I'm so so glad I was able to experience this wonderful place. The one bad thing was I felt little separated from the rest of the restaurant being in the corner with other a few other couples.
Our 10 year anniversary! Amazing experience!!! The attention to detail was out of this world. Sergio was so attentive, went out of his way to make sure our anniversary was stellar, and even orchestrated a picture with the head chef. Thank you Sergio, we will be back, and being more friends with us. . . Larry
We love the show and Ramsey ' s unwillingness to except anything less than perfection. That being said I was disappointed with my meal. To start I had the octopus fingerling salad. The octopus was wonderful.  Tender not chewy. Also tried the fried oysters they too were great, onto the main which took too long to arrive. We ordered the short ribs, skirt steak and I had the lamb duo so it's not like we ordered the beef wellington. My lamb was cold I ordered it med rare but it came rare which adds to why it was cold. The portions were on the small side but I will overlook such things in exchange for excellence which is what I expected but was sadly let down. The best for me was the bone marrow I ordered as a side. Service was okay. Over all it was hit and miss and over priced.
