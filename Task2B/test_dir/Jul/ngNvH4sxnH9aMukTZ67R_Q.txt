They may offer quantity... But not quality. Not worth the money.
Bring an empty stomach Great food selection, great service. Mexican and Chinese food sections were excellent.  Crab legs were awesome! Dessert was average, but who eats dessert after a buffet? :)
Honestly,  this place is not so great anymore. It used to be alot better. With alot more selection. A few stations had similar things.  I wouldnt call it a selection. Not alot of meat selection either. It seems like people like coming here for crab legs and shrimp. Honestly, i think the Spice market at PH has alot more selection for lunch.  But i wouldnt recommend it since its gotten me sick twice already! Anyhow, i would say its average now. Not sure if its worth the price anymore. I guess it depends how much you are willing to pay.
I go to Vegas buffets all the time, and this is the worst I've been to so far.  Just go across the street and go to Ceaser's palace and eat at the buffet there.  It's like 20 times better!  And it's like 10 bucks more -_-
AWESOME buffet, especially when locals get it for 12 bucks!
This was a pretty good buffet.  We used a groupon for a two person dinner and a bottle of trinity oaks wine.  The place is located on the west side of the Rio.  It's a bit of a hike from the strip.  We walked to and from the Mirage and in July summer heat it was just bearable.  If you have the extra $40-50 for cab fare I'd recommend going that route.  . . The staff were ok on our trip.  It took a long time to be seated because of a chef changeout at all the stations.  Shouldn't have much impact on the food already out or cooking but I guess it did.  After being seated I walked up to the bar and was helped right away, given two glasses and my wine on a bucket of ice.  It took a long time for our server to bring silverware or waters as well.  They did come by reasonably quickly to pick up plates however.  . . The food was pretty tasty overall.  This buffet like many others on the strip are separated by region.  They have American, Asian, Italian, Mexican  seafood and dessert.  The crab and shrimp were very tasty and the Asian section was our favorite.  The Mexican section was the low point as much of the food was bland, undercooked and cold.  Desserts were very good they had a wide selection to include several different flavors of gelato and fresh banana fosters. . . Overall we enjoyed the food and atmosphere of this place.  It had a couple low point but as far as things go I would recommend giving it a try if you are in the strip area.
Went here once again with my entire family on Monday because it was my grandmother's birthday, and let me tell you.. The Carnival buffet is declining as far as food quality/quantity go :(. . The local discount is no longer 50% off. It's now 25%, and that includes your Total Rewards Card. Not only is it pricier for locals, but their food is a bit of a disappointment. They still have delicious crab legs that you can get warm or cold (I prefer cold if you ask me), and the delicious cocktail shrimp which they now have in Cajun. The cajun shrimp honestly tastes like they just sprinkled it the powder it on it and served it as is. When it came to dessert time, they didn't even have much of a selection compared to the last other times we were here. HUGE disappointment if you ask me :(. . Their service is the only reason why I gave them two stars. There were ten people in our table, yet our server was on top of his game! He took away our food and refilled our drinks, and the best part was that we didn't even have to ask him twice or we didn't even have to flag him down to ask for refills. It's like he read our minds and got what we needed.. . With that said, Carnival Buffet had better service but everything else is on the decline. I would much rather pay a visit to the Village Seafood Buffet at the other side of the casino!
Decided to come here instead of bacchanal.  Bf and I wouldn't mind paying over $100 for both of us, but the wait time is ridiculous so we decided to come to Rio.  Glad we did! Asian food was great, bbq bf loved, the pizzas were pretty good etc.  Don't forget the gelatos.  It's was surprisingly pretty cheap for the both of us.. $67.  No wait.
Bought a great deal on Groupon. Usually dinner is $32 per person, but with Groupon came out to $22 per person! Plus, you get a bottle of wine of your choice!. . There is a huge variety of food. It's just not possible to try everything, unless you are subhuman! Roast beef, prime rib, turkey, chicken, tacos, ribs, salads, sushi on and on and on. They have italian ice cream and a lot of desserts to choose from.  I've been to other buffets in Las Vegas and can safely say this is top 3 in my opinion.. . Service was great. Our dirty dishes were removed quickly, water refilled and it was all done with a great attitude. The line to enter for dinner went very quickly.. . No complaints from me.
Not the worst buffet, but -definitely- not the best. It's gotten more expensive as time passes, and for no reason. Because this buffet does not have the kind of quality anymore to be hiking prices up like that!. . Ambiance: 3 - This buffet is always very clean at its stations and very organized. At the tables, not so much. Tables are rather scattered, disorganized and a bit dirty when you sit down. . . Service: 4 - Our server was very good and extremely funny. He really always took care of us, constantly refilling our drinks and even getting us extra plates when one of us ate some crabs or crawfish! . . Food: 2 - The only things really worth eating at this buffet was crab and dessert. But this time, even the crab legs were just sub-par, only having a little bit of meat inside. The rest of the food was just average--there's really nothing that I can say because, well, nothing really stood out!. . Carnival used to be a better, cheaper buffet with bigger crab legs and with slightly better food! But now, going to Village Seafood Buffet is just a way, way better idea than spending that money at Carnival.
From my 1 year old:"This was the best buffet I've ever tasted.The crab was a little frozen but other than that it was great.The meats were nice and hot. This buffet beats every buffet I've ever eaten.". . I remember when the Rio was the best buffet in town and should be credited for creating the standard for all of Vegas' buffetts.  . . It is good to see that this is one buffet which Harrarahs did not screw up (it certainly did that to The Spice Market Buffett).
This buffet was awesome. No line when we got there and the food was amazing! I have never had such delicious beef ribs. Lots of vegetarian options as well which surprised me. The only reason I took away a star was because of the price. For 2 adults a 2 year old and a "close enough" 4 year old we paid 90 (after a $3 tip) make sure you are hungry or have jackets with big pockets if you eat here.
They have a good selection. Servers are friendly. Food is great except the limited selection for desserts. The last time I went there, the servers at the dessert section were chit-chatting. They know people were waiting but acted like they didn't noticed.
Ok, this buffet has it's ups and downs, but overall I actually like it and would definitely return for another meal, even though it's off the strip.. . The Ups - The food selection here is absolutely wonderful!  No matter what you have a taste for, this buffet will have it to fix that craving.  The staff at this buffet also seem very friendly and prompt once you enter the buffet itself (for more on that, see The Downs).  While the food isn't top notch steakhouse quality, it is still very very good, especially for a buffet of this size.. . The Downs - The line is a major down about this buffet.  We arrived and got in line at 4:30pm on a Monday for dinner and didn't arrive at the cashier until 5:15 to pay for our meals.  Once we paid, it took approximately another 45 minutes for us to get seated (finally sat shortly after 6pm).. . Overall, even with the wait, the buffet was still outstanding.  Was the 90 minute wait worth it? For me it was because it was my first time here.  Next time I visit, if the wait seems to be an hour or less, I'll definitely try it again.
Purchased a groupon for 2 for $49 taxes not included was great food looked fresh didn't wait in line, if you arrive after 7pm you'll be in a line. Waiters are great def will return again when in town.
My first trip to the Carnival Buffet and I can say it will be my last visit there. On the plus side the prime rib was pretty good with atomic horseradish sauce. The rest was truly forgettable. Many items were greasy,overlooked, or cold.Just because it is a ton of food for every whim doesn't make it good to eat. This was a valuable lesson learned .
This place did not disappoint.  My husband and I left quite content. So much that I almost had to be rolled out of there. Definitely recommend going before 6:15 to avoid the long line. This place had so much food and so much variety. I was even craving a wonton soup and surely enough they had some! They even had chilled edamame. Their fried chicken was good too. We sat near the dessert area, a very central location.  I found that I had to walk far at times to explore food options but it was well worth it and at the same timeit gave me a chance to walk out the food a bit :-) I don't recommend this place for someone wanting all their food crowded together. Our waiter was great and our cups were never empty.  This is by far our top choice for buffets in the Total Rewards buffet deal. I only wish the wonton soup was less salty and that the cobbler would've been warm.
Not worth all the hype. Some of the food was cold. We only went because there was a deal on groupon. I wouldn't go there otherwise. The waiter took forever to get our drink order and the food was bland.
It's a buffet people!  Buffets are not fabulous 5-star dining!  We've eaten here Twice, never waited more than 5 mins to be seated and the servers are efficient and polite.  Nice selection of food, buffet is maintained well and taste of food is OK.
Definitely not THE best buffet in Vegas, but I chose this place specifically for its value. . Having said that, this buffet is pretty damn good and has A LOT of selections. Crab Legs for days, surprisingly good Asian food (they even have Pho!), and all your other essential Vegas buffet selections (Italian, Mexican, American).. . This place is also huge; that could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how lazy you are. It stretches pretty far so you may have a long walk back to your table, but at least you're burning some calories at a buffet amirite? Hehe. . Also I wish they had more fruit selection as they only had melons and pineapples when I went. Not a deal breaker, but it's always a good idea to fruit it up after all the meat and carbs you're going to be stuffing down.. . Overall though this place is good for the price. Obviously if you want the full vegas buffet experience, you might want to check out the pricier places on the strip :). . Happy Eating!!
Great food a lot o food paradise of food anything you can think of to eat they have their don't waste your time on the rice and potatoes eat what you don't usually eat, and try new stuff you may just end up liking it or loving it. Try to find a 2-for-1 Groupon deal with a free bottle of wine
For those who want to see how Carnival World Buffet looks like, I have recorded a FULL HD WALK-Though of the whole Buffet (Probably the best Rio Buffet walk-through on YouTube). It took me nearly 10 mins to record the full buffet from one end to anther end.  . . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8exL50x3wc. .  After visiting Vegas over a dozen times, it was time for me to try Rio Buffet, since a lot of people keep saying that this buffet is one of the largest in all of Vegas perhaps the world. . . All I have to say is that this indeed is one of the biggest buffets I have ever seen in my life. It was very hard for me to choose what to eat since there were so many to choose from. Even my mom said she got tired from walking and carrying the heavy plate at the end of the buffet station to the table. This goes to show how long the buffet station is.. . We got in lines for the buffet at 3pm and ended up paying the lunch price instead of the dinner price. Dinner starts at 3:30. I think we got a great deal since we got to enjoy dinner food at 3:30 instead of paying at a dinner price.. . The food here is so-so. Not that great, but great for your stomach.  Since there were a lot of food to choose from, the quality of the food is just okay, not the best.. . The snow crab legs here are somewhat small and cold. I wish it can be steamed like some buffets on the Vegas Strip.. . Now I can officially say I've dined at Rio Buffet. . . Will I come back? Probably not, unless I get the 24 hrs buffets pass.. . So here's a full steady tour of the largest buffet in Vegas:. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8exL50x3wc
This is our go to buffet place in Vegas. It's more reasonably priced than most big Vegas buffets and has a huge selection of food to choose from. . . We've gone for lunch and dinner, but not breakfast. So I can't say much about that. Our times here have been good. The waiters were excellent and the staff was great every time. The food itself ranges from good - really good. There is a wide selection to satisfy anyone's taste truly. So much food it's overwhelming. . . We've come here often enough to notice the repetitiveness of what they serve, and realize that while the food is good, paying more elsewhere could potentially yield better food, in other words you get what you pay for. . . Not to say this place is bad, it certainty isn't! . It's really the go to place for a reasonably priced, filling, good (not amazing or spectacular!) buffet in Vegas. It certainly isn't the best buffet available, the quality of the food is okay, so check it out if you're like me and not willing to pay atrocious prices at places like Caesars Palace or the Wynn.
Endless shrimp and endless crab legs. Top it off with friendly staff and Buffet of Buffets unlimited dining, what more can you ask ?
I really enjoyed the CARNIVAL buffet at RIO. They have such a great variety of all kinds of different foods. You have the roast beef which was so tender. They had Asian, Spanish, comfort foods. They also had a sushi/seafood bar with fresh crab legs and marinated shrimp. The staff is super friendly. My favorite part the wine bar but that is not included in the buffet price but was still cool. Went during the week so the line wasn't too bad. For all the options too the price was reasonable. Would definitely want to eat here again and try more foods.
This buffet deserves to be in the hall of fame. . . There was a wide selection of food for all kinds of tastebuds. Their clam chowder was definitely on point. . . Secondly, there was the outstanding service. The waiters were extremely friendly and helpful in getting our drinks, plates, or even give suggestions on what to do in Vegas. . . Last but not least was the dessert. Oh my, the dessert. The gelato was as good as any gelato store. You can't go wrong with any flavor, but my favorite was the strawberry. There was also cupcakes, moose, and pie. . It is included in the Buffet of Buffets so it is extremely convenient to access.
We've been here a few times. Haven't been disappointed yet. As other readers would say there are certainly better buffets out there, but you would also pay a ton more. For the price you pay it is really good. All the norms of a traditional buffet, prime rib, sliced beef, etc. I had a couple exceptional dishes, the Chinese station was delicious. I had the egg rolls, pot stickers, fried rice, Mongolian beef and pork. It was awesome. My wife loved the California rolls and bratwurst and was absolutely satisfied. Overall I was happy, coulda got another star for better deserts and better Mexican. Definitely worth the trip.
We went here after buying a groupon. It was a good buffet but by far not one of the best. I am actually glad i got the groupon because I would have been upset if I would have payed full price for this place. Luckily I did read other reviews and I knew not to expect anything amazing. I just wanted to enjoy all the options they provide.. . Overall you have endless choices of food. The quality of the food is pretty low though. Nothing amazed me. Theres nothing really here to go out of your way for. Everything is mediocre. The best thing i tried was the tiramisu gelato. It was good and different. The worst was the calamari. It tasted like it had been sitting there for too long. And it probably had. Theres is not a great dessert selection either. Very basic and nothing special to the dessert selections.. . I didn't hate this buffet but I had tried the Bellagio and Palms buffets and they were far superior to this one. Of course less selection but everything tasted really great. Also the Palms has way cheaper prices and tasted way better in my opinion. . At the end of the day the variety hurts this buffet at Rio because they never truly get to master a dish. Everything lacks quality.. . I don't think I would try it here again because it isn't worth the price. Unless theres a major makeover that happens to this buffet then I would rather use my money elsewhere.
A really pleasant surprise. We visited years ago and did not enjoy the experience. We visited again on July 23 and really did enjoy the experience. The offerings were fresh and tasty food was well presented and the variety was extensive. We look forward to our next visit
