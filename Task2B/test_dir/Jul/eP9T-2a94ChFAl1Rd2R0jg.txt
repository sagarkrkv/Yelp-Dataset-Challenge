Key advice: Definitely know what you're getting into if you're deciding on staying at here.. . Keeping this in mind will definitely make your stay a whole lot more pleasant. I mean... maybe people like to complain just for the sake of complaining, I don't know. I know I do sometimes, but really? A little trip planning and some research will tell you that there is no casino and the parking situation is valet only. Personally, at the end of the day, I really enjoyed the fact that we didn't have a casino. After walking through and playing in casinos all day, being able to head right up to the elevators and our room was nice. The complimentary valet was also a nice touch, made our entire stay feel very #fancy.. . I've gotta say that I loved how every single aspect of this hotel felt very upscale. Um, hellooo.. everything here practically glitters. From the gold facade of the glass windows from the outside of the hotel, to all the gleaming marble errrrthang, and even the sparkly decorations in the lobby--I loved every bit of it. The lobby smells so lovely, all those flowers! So refreshing after smelling cigarettes in casinos all day. . . I lucked out on priceline and was able to get two of the most basic rooms here for a pretty sweet price. Even for the most standard option available, the rooms here are super spacious, comes with both a huge bed and a pull out couch, equipped with a little living room/seating area, and even a kitchenette! Not that you'd need to do much cooking in the land of cheap buffets, but having the option is definitely nice. I loved that there was even a coffee maker and a nice and cold fridge! There's a whole lot of storage space, and awesome floor to ceiling windows. Loved spending a few moments at the window before knocking out, since we were lucky enough to get a room on a pretty high floor with a gorgeous view of the strip! . . They really don't skimp on space here, because I think that the Trump's bathroom is one of the largest I've ever been in. In addition to a stand up shower, there's also a huge jacuzzi tub. There's even a TV in the bathroom mirror, so you can entertain yourself while primping to go out! Talk about luxurious. . . Even though the hotel is a little bit off the strip, this isn't a problem at all. The drive is really less than a minute off the strip, and having no car isn't a problem either. The hotel has frequent shuttles that come and go, jetting off to the Wynn, Venetian, and Caesars. And for shopping lovers, the Fashion Show Mall is literally right across the street. Need I say more?
We just returned from our 3 night stay here as a family and loved it:). . We really enjoyed the smoke free lobby, the entire staff was so nice! I like the fact that there was no casino in the lobby. It was just a quick walk, shuttle, or taxi over to the Wynn, etc. for that:) we had such a blast in the pool everyday! Wait staff very efficient and always brought by ice water since it was sweltering at the pool. We dined downstairs in the Trump restaurant 2 of the 3 nights during our stay and really liked it, just seemed there was always a new person working and service was not consistent each night. Still good, just not consistent. . . Morning coffee in the restaurant was just so-so (not strong enough for me, at least:) The beds in room, so cozy and my absolute favorite part of the experience was the fabulous bathroom with TV built into mirror...I had it tuned into the jazz music channel the entire time...very cool! Also had airline flight info for incoming and outgoing flights! Very slick Mr. trump:) But.......the couch pull out bed? It was hard, mediocre and cheap. Felt bad that the kids had to sleep on it. It was a bit dangerous, especially with the metal sides. Just use caution when getting in and out of the thing! Still can't believe that was what was offered in this hotel?. . The only reason I did not give hotel '5' star rating was because of HOUSEKEEPING service. I could tell she came by, beds re-made, towels replenished, but the amount of dust that lingered, especially near computer desk area was ridiculous. On the second day, a DIRTY DUST RAG was actually left behind by the the housekeeper on the nightstand. I was pretty grossed out by it but understand accidents do happen. I tossed it onto the bathroom floor and it got picked up the next day. I am still amazed at the amount of dust in that room....where was it even coming from? I was also a bit irritated that one of the sinks in the bathroom was slow to drain, but I left a note and it got resolved immediately. I also noticed we were not given a refresh on toiletries the entire time we were there!!! would have been nice to have more of the lotion and shampoo!!. . All in all, a great place to stay and it was definitely family friendly. The boys were given cute Trump backpacks with coloring books, crayons and sun glasses. Front desk/bell man/concierge all very helpful and professional! I would stay here again!
My boyfriend and myself greatly enjoyed our stay over the July 4th weekend. The no smoking policy is fantastic; as someone with terrible allergies to smoke and a true disdain for the smell, this hotel was a breath of fresh air, literally. . . Rooms are very clean and nicely decorated. The hotel has lovely decor and an upscale feel to it. Service was friendly and accommodating. Staff was respectful and courteous to myself and my boyfriend which at times is rare in Vegas because we are young. Hotel workers always say hello and good morning on elevators and throughout the building. . . My only complaint would be the cost of additional services such as room service food. Granted room service is intended to be pricey, but this is Las Vegas. Nearby are many more cheaper food options, and I feel the hotel should be more conscious of this fact. The gift shop in the main lobby has more reasonable drink options than the in service menu. . . All in all a good stay, would recommend.
I stayed here with my boyfriend this past weekend (7/4). It was my first time staying at one of the nicer hotels in Vegas. It was a delightful experience. The hotel was extremely clean and smelled great! We got an upgrade as well as a room with a view of the strip. No regrets there! We were able to see the fireworks and the pretty city lights :). Loved the kitchen with the bar, loved the bathrooms, loved the jacuzzibathtub, but most of all, we loved the bed!!! We usually try to get out and do a lot of things but on one of the days we just slept in and it was wonderful. We didn't spend any time in the living room, which also had a giant tv and a giant L-shaped couch which would've been nice if we had guests to entertain. By the way, they have this tv built into the bathroom mirror over the sink which was cool because I like to watch tv when I go twosies (I swear that's what the tv is there for!) Aside from the awesome room, the shuttle service was great for our day buffet trip to the Bacchanal and there were always taxis waiting. 5/5 experience. We will definitely book here for our next trip!
I sent my two employees to class in Las Vegas. I booked one room with two beds for two nights. I called and emphasis it must be two beds because it is for two girls. Later I got two confirmation email which are produced at same time. I thought their system accidentally sent same content twice so I left them alone. When my employees showed up they were told they have two rooms booked and my employees told them we only booked one room and they stayed in one room. One month later I found out Trump charged my credit card for two room for two nights. I called them to argue about it. I was told that even if that was a mistake but I did not catch it and cancel it in time. So they will still charge for two rooms since they were booked.  My point is they do not want to do anything about it and let customer to pay for their mistakes.
Beautiful hotel & great rooms w spacious bathrooms double sinks/vanities . . Trump staff was so helpful & gracious! . . The only downside was the cell phone service. Due to the concrete and location my AT&T mobile and wifi didn't work properly. I had to put my phone on the windowsill in my room or walk down to the lobby.. . Other than that, I will definitely stay there again . . Xoxo
I have to say i don't like Donald Trump but this was the cheapest hotel that wasn't too far away from the convention center and the strip but at the same time not right on it. I will go ahead and tell you why i didn't give it a 5 star rating first and then go ahead with everything i loved about it. When i got there (not a busy day) there was a line with a 10-15 minute wait to check in, and the day i left  (a busy day) was even longer. and when i did check in, there were no rooms ready and i had to wait 45 minutes for it to be ready. So I'm not sure what was up with that but it didn't start my stay well. . Once i got to my room i was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was for the price of a hotel with no casino. There is a mini but complete kitchen, great views, spacious room all over, and very clean. . No i don't eat out often and especially with the prices you pay to eat out in vegas. So i needed to find a grocery store  to stock up on food for the 4 days i was gong to be there. I called down to the concierge desk and i have to say Ricca who was working that day was absolutely amazing!! she went above and beyond to help find me the cheapest and quickest ride to a Trader Joes a couple of miles away. After that experience i was hopeful ;-). I didn't spend a ton of time in the hotel as i was there for a convention but i used their gym every day and it has everything 95% of anyone that works out would need.. The pool is very luxurious with servers, a pool side bar with a foodmenu as well.. I did go to the restaurant in the lobby for a drink one night and breakfast the last morning. The bar tenders are very good and make wonderful drinks, their breakfast was delicious and the service is A++. Oh and one last note, they have the fastest elevators i have ever been in.
A friend had Pricelined a King at $160 this past weekend, and we used it as a crash pad after checking out of our off-strip digs on Sunday. Gotta say, pretty nice! Gaudy as all hell, but it's Trump - what do you expect?. . The room had sculpted vases and Ansel Adams coffee table books, the toilet has its own frosted-glass enclosure, the ice machine had its own room. Very clean, very updated, and very Vegas. . . The pool area was awesome - lots of chairs, and a very large pool so you won't be right on top of everyone else. They also have ice water that they pass out for free on super-hot days. My personal fave was the polarized windows along the pool that everyone kept using as a mirror. FYI, there's a gym on the other side, so you'll be adjusting your swimsuit right in front of a dude on an elliptical. :-). . At the right price, I'd definitely consider staying here in the future if I'm looking to be on the strip. More classy than I expected, Trump. Nicely done.
I loved this hotel, and can't wait to come back! We were in a one bedroom suite on the 41st floor. The room was beyond nice, and the master bathroom could fit an army in it. It's a quick 4 min walk to the strip, or you can cut through the mall (if it's really hot out). I had plans to go to the pool, but we were out andabout at the casinos. Yes this hotel does not have a casino, but it makes up for it! Can't wait to go back!! The staff was great!
Exceeding my expectations!! From the comped upgrade to a suite, to the incredibly friendly staff (Jazmine at the front desk and Christine at the pool) our stay at the Trump has been the epitome of above and beyond customer service and luxury. I had concerns after reading some reviews, but I have been beyond enthused with my choice.. . The hotel is not that far from the strip- there is a sidewalk or you can walk through the mall across the street. And by not that far, it's like a 3 min walk. It takes longer to walk through the lobby of Ceasars Palace. . . The room overlooking the Strip has amazing views- city AND mountain! . . Mostly though I feel surrounded by friends more than Hotel employees- it's made this trip everything and more!! Thank you Trump Resort!!
Room:. Amazing service, beautiful view and absolutely worth every penny.  Hotel exceeded my expectations and made for a wonderful trip.  Jetted Tub and marble walk in shower had high water pressure and made for a therapeutic end to walking all day.  . Hotel:. The initial gaudy theme was a little shocking when walking in, but once we got to the room we were blown away.  Strict no smoking policy just added to the cleanliness and relaxing atmosphere.  No noise, no obnoxious neighbors just a serene visit.  Luxurious, pampering and 5 stars all the way.  Complimentary shuttle to Wynn and Caesars Palace made up for the distance to the strip. . POOL:. Only downer  was the pool closing early. But the posh chairs and lounge service made up for it.  Servers came lounge chair to lounge chair poolside and handed out complimentary ice cold water.
Several factors lead to this review.. . First, the train noise that starts at or before 5 AM every morning. Not a great way to start the day. . . Second, there is no self park option. While I appreciate that some people like the convenience of valet, we do not. We often travel with classic/show cars so this would not be a hotel we would utilize for those times.. . Third, we booked this through priceline and it was a bit misleading as their site lists the hotel as on strip and it clearly is not. The hotel is not really convenient for walking anywhere. You have to either cab it or take the shuttle which only goes to the Wynn or Ceaser's.. . Fourth, after spending the entire morning roaming the strip we wanted to go back to our room and rest for a while before our dinner reservations later that night. We get back at around 3. The room has not been cleaned yet. We call the front desk and are told it would be at least 4:30 before housekeeping gets there to clean the room but they would be happy to send us clean towels in the mean time.. . Fifth, I decided to treat myself to a pedicure while my husband was at the pool. Nothing special about it. I could have and have had the same type/quality of pedicure that I get regularly for 1/4 of the price. . . While this is probably a great hotel if you are traveling with children or for business and want to be away from the strip but close enough for the excitement, it was not a good choice for us. We most likely will not stay here again. I would not rate this among the 5 stars that we have stayed in for past visits. Maybe 3.5 or 4.
My friend and I hotwired this place - a Saturday - Tuesday (that's three nights) stay ran $374 TOTAL (including the $25/day resort fee, at least, I think it was $25/day...) . . We were on the 34th floor facing north. There's a television in the mirror of the bathroom! The room was super posh - King bed, queen pullout (my friend actually opted to sleep on the couch, as a couch. She promised me it wasn't because I smelled funny... . . Speaking of smells! That spa smell that everyone's talking about? It really exists! It smells really luxurious inside the Trump, for REAL. The dresses I left hanging in the closet smelled so nice after I unpacked them, and even did my sleeping clothes from being in the sheets! A great non-smoking retreat, for sure. Seriously amazing. If you want to smell rich, stay at the Trump! . . As I wanted a chill day with friends, I reserved a poolside cabana for the day - $150, plus a 20% gratuity. The gratuity was worth it; our server, Brittany, was so nice and attentive, I tipped her extra. The TV was a great way to watch the game, and the food from the H2eau cafe (including two pitchers of frozen cocktails), was a perfect way to spend 7.5 hours. The pool is very much a hangout pool. It's not deep, so you can just stand in it and enjoy your drink. However, as the sun starts to set, the adults go inside to prep for a late night, and it gets inundated with splashy kids. . . Late checkout? No problem! (Not for us, at least.) . . It's across the street from Fashion Show Mall, the Nordstrom. You literally just walk across the crosswalk and you're there! . . For $11, you can get direct shuttle service to the airport, every hour on the hour. . . There were a few cons, but nothing to detract. . . The trains do roll through, but they were hardly noticeable for us city folk. If you're from somewhere super quiet, you'd probably get annoyed by this, but then... why are you expecting to sleep in Vegas? . . The sangria was terrible. Stick with hard liquor cocktails. . . It's not right on the strip, so be prepared to take cabs. The shuttle service was woefully inadequate. It never seemed to appear on time, and sometimes it was so full you couldn't get on anyways. . . I would definitely stay again!
This review is subject to change. I am here now. Booked for the weekend to celebrate my dads 73rd birthday.  Check in was superb, Christopher at the front desk is so nice and accommodating.  The lobby is spotlessly clean, no smoke at all.  Elevators spotlessly clean.  Room on 33rd floor is nice sized, spotlessly cleaned and well appointed.  Separate shower and jacuzzi tub, dual sinks.  Nice fridge and microwave.  We love the room.   Went to take a shower...NO water.  Called down for service.  Waited 15 minutes and called again.  Got a snotty operator (first one was very nice) who said it would be 10 min. I let her know it has been over 15.  Her snotty self said well then it will be 20 minutes.  Nice.  Bad attitude.  Anyhow, maintenance does come and he is very pleasant.   Sees what's wrong and pulls off the shower head as it is clogged or something.  He replaces the head and it is better.  He says there is clearly an issue and will check it but for now at least we have some water.  . . NOW my issue is clearly someone cleaned the room before we got here. Clearly the water wasn't working then yet it wasn't addressed.  Now that is annoying.  This should have been handled before we checked in.  Oh well. Room is spotlessly clean and the shower is flowing nicely. All is good. . . Bed is super comfy, nice soft robes in the closet and lots of towels.  Other than the water in the shower so far so good.  Good ac too as it is 106 here.. . Update as it needs to be updated. The next day (today Saturday ) TV stops getting a signal. No clear picture or sound. We call and maintenance is here very quickly. Says it is a common issue...power supply wears out. Changes it for us in under a minute.  Very. Nice except he hangs around for several minutes hunting for a tip.  I will not tip for maintenance issues like this. I tipped the front desk $10 on check in, valet $5 every single time I get my car (and there is no self parking here so it is ALL valet) but I am not tipping for a busted tv.  He finally leaves.  TV works. Then this evening we go to dinner at the forum shops and take the free shuttle.  Very convenient and driver 1 super nice ( and he was also tipped). We go to pick it up...huge fiasco at the line and the shuttle driver 2 was unprofessional and unhelpful and to be blunt..rude.  Suffice it to say my group and 4 other groups all had to take cabs. We were livid. We called and asked for the manager. We got heather on the line. Heather was very professional and helpful and resolved the issue as best she could. When you have 5 unrelated and completely separate people all upset about the same thing...you know there is an issue.   . . So in a nutshell after this novel of a review...3 issues, 3 easy resolutions.  I would stay here again actually as the rooms are wonderful and this place smells delightful. Like flowers all the time.  No smoke, no litter, no dust.  Very clean.  I understand our issues can happen anywhere and the Trump staff was, for the most part, very good at handling them all.  Plus the location which is 100 feet from nordstroms, is AWESOME.  If every hotel had a manager like Heather ( and I hope the Trump execs read these reviews) and front desk like Christopher, then clients would be very happy and would return.  Thanks Heather and Christopher  from the guests in room 3318.
My go-to hotel in Vegas. I actually like that there's no casino so there's only that amazing spa-like smell. Don't know what it is but you'll know when you get there! . . As for the rooms themselves, LOVE the beds, huge jacuzzi tub and kitchenette. Not that I ever cook in Vegas but I like the option of saving the other half of my Earl's sandwich and heating it up in the microwave. . . Only gripe, where's the Food Network at?! . . I've also been the Fitness Center and it's even better than the Westin Workout! Like the Westin, they also offer workout clothes if you forget yours (like the Westin). They also have group classes - check the white board. . . Trump IS at the end of the strip across from the Wynn/Fashion Show but they offer free shuttles to Wynn & Caesar's. They also offer an airport shuttle for $11!
I love how there is no casino in this hotel! its great for kids, it doesn't smell like smoke at all... we had a suite.. and their rooms are nice and clean. Full working kitchen, just make sure you bring your own pots and pans.. hehe!!! only bad thing is that if your room is in the back, you can hear the train at 5:30am!!! soo loud...!!!! so try requesting a room that has the view of the strip! they also have a complimentray shuttle bus that goes to wynn and ceasar palace that comes every 15 mins, thats save you money from taking the cab/taxis! great ambiance and great experience!
Great staff beautiful property and check out the resturrant DJT you will enjoy it. The concierge at the Trump a very helpful.
