This is a great hotel, but if your looking for clean amenities this is not the place.. . So I'm going to start out with the great things about the tropicana:. . 1. The broadway musical "Mamma Mia!" Is now playing at the tropicana.. 2. Medium/large casino with lots of bars.. 3. Fast check-in. 4. Located right across MGM and is right on the strip.. . Okay. No too bad. But here's the catch:. . When we checked into our 2 queen bed room, there was MOLD around the bathtub. We were confused because the tropicana has been recently refurnished, but I guess they skipped the bathroom. . . So we requested a new room and they were very kind and gave us a new room for free. We checked in and the problem was the same in the room, but this time the water didn't drain! So for the third time we changed rooms and the problem still remained! . . So we demanded a suite because this seemed to be the only room they maintained. They refused and didn't give us another room so we checked out early. . . This was the only time IN MY LIFE I had to check out of a hotel.. . So bad things about tropicana:. . 1. Not clean. 2. Poor maintenance. 3. Pictures online are not the same in real life
Very disappointing in the service. Every person in staff that we worked with was unaware of their own services. Poor training and kept putting blame on others. We enjoy Las Vegas and this was a terrible visit. Our promotions was three nights free and they could only give us two nights and we had to drive back to the hotel for Mama Mia on the third night. Do not stay here or join the players club
My experience here was better than I expected. The lady that checked my boyfriend and I in were super friendly and the people working at the tables were nice too. I don't mind staying here again. Service was quick too. I like how the decor is all white, which is hard to maintain, so that's amazing. The shower's tub was a bit chipped but it still works haha. BUT the food here is expensive and not tasty =/
OK.  I gave it 4 stars, so I liked it, but I will nitpick.. . So I booked it thru the "pay now, find out the name later" system on Expedia & got a great deal.  They couldn't guarantee the bed number, but they did promise 2 queen beds over the phone.  Got there & guess what?  Only 2 queens in a smoking room.  :( But they brought up a roll-out which was nice & offered to move us the 2nd day.. . 2nd day - guess what?  They moved us to a room with 2 queen beds -- in a smoking room!  (& it REEKED 100x worse than the casino floor).  But they agreed to move us again & shortly did.. . A note about the Club Tower: If you are on the odd # side of the hallway, you WILL be woken up the next day by the poolside DJ.  On the 7th floor, buried under pillows and with earplugs in, the music was still POUNDING.  Really, Tropicana?  The number of people wanting DJ music at the pool is greater than the number of people wanting to sleep in a bit?  In VEGAS???. . Otherwise, the rooms were clean & the staff was friendly.  Front desk often took nearly 10 minutes to answer the phone, which wasn't great.  And the casino never had $5 blackjack, which as a low-roller I would have liked.  But otherwise, good.  I'd likely stay there again.
The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. Unfortunately, this hotel is rated as 4 star on some sites (Priceline). I booked a 4 star hotel on Priceline and this was the place it gave me :( Tropicana is a 3 star cheesy Vegas hotel that I would never stay at again. There is no coffee pot, fridge, mini-bar, lighted mirror, etc in the rooms. There isn't even real tile in the bathrooms, and the caulking between the tub and faux tile backsplash was yellowing. Thanks, but I like to Vegas in style...you guys can 3 star all you want, but It's Wynn and Palazzo for this girl!
I've stayed just about everywhere on and off the strip, over the past 15 years.  Many still around, many not.    However, I think this is the first time I've stayed at Tropicana (and for sure the first since the remodel).  First impressions were positive.  I really like the "South Beach" accents and crisp, clean white color scheme. Check-in was just fine...as was overall cs.    So overall, the hotel is real nice.  We stopped in at Biscayne, but only for drinks (planned on eating, but it just never worked out, in terms of timing).  Biscayne looks REALLY nice.  I like what they've done.  The menu looks nice too!  We'll do a dinner there next trip through.   So overall, I'm a fan.  However, there were some opportunities for improvement:. . 1- "resort fee"-  yes, I know just about every hotel is now charging this scam....er, I mean fee, and not including it in the price of the hotel room.  Eventually, this will be ruled illegal (see FTC rules on "deceptive pricing")  and every hotel operator will be crushed underneath a massive class-action....but until then, it's just annoying. (trust me on this, keep your receipts for every stay at any hotel which charges a mandatory "resort fee".   I'm betting your money, plus interest and probably penalty fees will eventually be coming back to you).  NOTE-  nearly every Las Vegas strip hotel does this mandatory  "resort fee" thing.  It's a scam for sure....but I am not sure every hotel really wanted to be part of it from the beginning.  For example,  some hotels (Harrah's properties for example)  initially wouldn't go along....but then, I bet the consumer, just looking at the advertised nightly room rate, thought they were higher priced, since the other guys could go lower, but sneak a $20-$30 per night "resort fee" in there.  So, those hotels who didn't charge the hidden fee, perhaps lost business by being cheaper.  I wonder if that's what happened to many of the hotels, which forced them to go along with a deceptive pricing scheme.  I hope the FTC handles this once and for all.....soon.  . 2- High-Speed wireless internet included in the "resort fee"-  until that is.....you actually use it, and realize that it's "free" for up to 1mb. For "unlimited" wifi, it's $9.99 per day!  So, um....what's this "resort fee" covering again?  Water? Pillows? Fitness Center you won't use??. 3- Pool cleanliness-  I won't go into detail...but on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the cleanest.....I'd rank it a 3.    This is Vegas.  Provide excellence or move on.. . Edit on the pool-  I just want to add that Tropicana has a really nice pool area.  It's part "old Vegas" and part modern, hip with new cabanas and a stage.   There is so much potential here.  The weekday pool just. in my opinion, during our stay, didn't live up to the potential.
Not a bad looking place! I hadn't been here back in the day but I was surprised to see it so bright, colorful, and modern when I walked in. The rooms are clean, well kept - no issues there. They have a bar near the elevators where there are bands which play every night. There's also a restaurant in the back which serves 24 hours so you can get your drunk snack when you need to. . . The gym is small but it has enough cardio machines and it overlooks the pool so you can people watch while you get your sweat on.. . I also like the fact that you can walk across the walkway to catch the Tram to Luxor and Mandalay Bay. You also have the option to walk across different overpasses to also get to MGM and New York New York.
I love the new Tropicana. We have stayed here three times over the past two years. The management, staff and just in general everyone who works here is super nice. We always have a clean, modern room. He have stayed in the far towers as well as the club towers. They both were fine. The pool is AWSOME!!!! It's fun but not over crowded like others. We have dined at all of the restaurants. We liked them all the beach cafe is really the best. But that lobster Mac n cheese at Biscayne is YUMMY :). As for ppl complaining about the amount of wifi u get get a life u are in Vegas, u really need more than 1g a day? Plus the location is great!!!!! See u next time!!!
This place is great!! The Tropicana has been remodeled and looks amazing. I got in at 10 and the hotel staff gladly held my bags for me so I could site see. Upon checking in the front desk lady was so sweet!! She got us checked in and on our way. The room is wonderful. It has a super comfy bed, large bathroom and great decor. We had dinner last night at one of the restaurants in the hotel and it was delicious. The staff have all been friendly and the food was actually better than I expected. I highly recommend staying here.
