Two of us went here to celebrate a birthday.  What an amazing experience.  You'd never know you're in the middle of a noisy casino - it is away from everything.  The atmosphere is quiet and sophisticated without being stuffy.  In fact, our wait staff team was a great combination of being knowledgeable and fun.  The wine list gave us an ample selection and we were not disappointed with our choices.  We treated ourselves to the rib eye steak and fillet meals with fingerling potato side.  It was wonderful - done as requested with amazing taste thanks to the way they prepare it.  We would have loved to try a dessert (the pictures looked wonderful) but were too full despite sharing the potato side dish.  Maybe next time, we'll split an entree, too so we have room for dessert.  Overall, the entire experience was a real treat.
Pretty good. It was an enjoyable meal although somewhat pricey. Food-wise I ordered the foie gras appetizer, bone-in ribeye, and pecan pie. Even if you like foie gras pass on this one. It was heavily coated in honey and I didn't enjoy it. The bone-in ribeye was delicious and cooked to perfection as was the pecan pie. . . Delmonico has a great wine list and we ordered a nice bottle that complimented all of our meals and then we ended with a nice 40 year tawny port and coffee. . . Someone in my group had ordered a filet cooked medium and if was more medium-rare than medium. . . I would return here but it's not a place that I would make a regular for me when I go to Vegas.
Fantastic experience. Went here with a group of 9 and we all enjoyed ourselves. The service was exceptional; the lobster bisque was generous with the portions of lobster; and the bone in strip steak was good (although not the best I've had.) A friend had the salmon and said it was in his top 5 restaurants ever.  For sides we had broccoli and mash for the table..both were good. I'd definitely go back.
Outstanding!! Service - Perfect!! Food - Excellent and large portion size!  Clean & Elegant.
Excellent steaks.  The best we had on the whole trip.  The wine was also terrific.  The waitress was also very friendly and accommodating.  The only negatives were the side dishes.  The asparagus was just OK and seemed flavorless.  The potatoes were also lacking in flavor.  The steaks are well worth it though and I would go back in a heartbeat.
Came for lunch mid-day and it was not crowded.  Service was exceptional but food was so disappointing.. I LOVED Emeril's restaurant in New Orleans (NOLA) and I was sooo excited but this was a let down.  . I had the ceasar and it was fine but nothing compared to the one at NOLA (which was the best one of my life).  The ricotta grilled cheese was bland (but good in that comfort food kind of way).  The tomato soup it came with was good--nothing special.. The dessert (apple fritters) were amazing--mini-apple crispy pies with good ice cream.  I would go back for only that.  Otherwise, nothing special and a personal let down.
Our party of six dined at Delmonico for my 50th birthday celebration.   In short, the service was outstanding!  Our head waiter was Michael and the manager on the floor was Vincent.   We also had at least two others who served us.  All were very professional and patient. Our party was not the eaisiest to serve that night, but what happens in Vegas...!. . Obviously food tastes are very subjective.  My bone in ribeye and twice baked potato were great.  I did not care too much for the chicken and waffle dish my wife had... neither did she.  The shrimp appetizer was a 10, as was the crab dish.   The desserts... Creme Brulee, banana creme pie and chocolate cake were very good also.  Overall, a very nice experience.  We will return.
I ordered the halibut (as did my cousin) and it was dry. The entire dish had zero flavor until I added salt and pepper (I NEVER salt my food after cooking). The sides we had were good- wild mushrooms and creamed spinach. Our husbands steaks were good but nothing to write home about. Servers were attentive but they get a big zero for 1 reason- we told them our fish was dry in a very nice/hushed manor and they still charged us for it. Our bill was $1500 and they couldn't part with 2 $40 entrees. Wow! We won't be back. There's too much amazing food out there and much classier service.
Honestly, I wanted to like this place. This was not our first time there but it will be our last. The Cesar salad was the highlight of the meal and still one of the best I've ever had. The steak was just OK. The sides were quite good but it is a steakhouse so I was expecting something much better. The deserts were not bad just not mind blowing. For the price, unfortunately it was not worth it.
Place is amazingly good on all levels. From reservations to hostess to waitstaff and the  food is to die for. I love a good steakhouse and this one is one of my top in Las Vegas . Had lobster mac and cheese, onion soup, the surf and turf , rib eye was just delicious. The meat just melts in your mouth.  Dessert was the s'mores , which just ended the meal with a bang.. Bill for 4 was well over $900 or maybe more but well worth the splurge. Great ambiance. Will be back
Enjoyed the meal. $50 for a filet mignon. Cooked to perfection. The creamed spinach ($9)  might be the best I ever had. A nice flavor. Sort of had a hint of wood burned flavor added to it. The bread that was served with it was like a Yorkshire pudding that had a slight wood burned taste...excellent. The coffee was less than average. The service was excellent.  (Only odd thing...when the crumbs were cleaned off the table while I was between a course, they were not cleaned to a plate, but the empty chair).
