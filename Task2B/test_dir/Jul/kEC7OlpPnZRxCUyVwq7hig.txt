We've been to Vegas several times before, but this is the first time staying here. The reason they're receiving only one star is that upon checkout they added a $24.64 charge PER DAY resort fee. I know this may be a common (shady) practice on and near the strip in Vegas, but I've since found out that the Hard Rock in particular is known for burying this fee: www.travelandleisure.com/travel-blog/carry-on/topic/news/trip-doctor-what-is-a-resort-fee-and-do-i-really-have-to-pay-it. . When checking out, it was the first time I was told I had to pay this fee. They said that I had signed for it at check in (it's at the bottom of the fine print you have to scroll down and it's near the end beneath where where you sign your name on the credit card machine,) it's in the fine print on their website, and it's in the sleeve that holds the key cards. They also said its part of the script upon checking in, but all they mentioned was that there'd be a $50 per dayhold against room incidentals. . . The resort fee is a way for hotels to publish low room rates, but then tack on an extra 20-30% or more. . . It's sad that we ended an otherwise enjoyable trip to have the last few coins wrung out of us. Very short sighted, as those will be the last few coins you'll see from us, Hard Rock.
My wife and I stayed at the HRH tower, the room was ok. But down at the pool, in Cabana's watch your wallets. you think you are going to get rip off at the casino. they are going to get you while ordering food and drinks, with a 300% mark up.$88 per pitcher of bloody mary, $25.for a soda with a REhab cup. the pool was nice. but watch your wallet. I wouldn't do this again.
I've stayed here a few times and the rooms are always very nice. Flat screen TV, upscale decorating, and a large classy shower with glass doors. The gambling is very good here I normally get a lot of play. The "Culinary Drop Out" restaurant is a good place to eat, not a big fan of "The Pink Taco" I would say the food there is mediocre for Mexican. The center bar in the casino is the happening place, and I've gotten really good drinks there by casino bar standards.
Stayed here a bunch of times in the past. Seems like this time the place was cleaner and staff was friendlier. My room was pretty sweet. Booked the hotel for $32 plus a resort fee but that'snothing. Good value if you don't gamble too much.  Got to see widespread panic at the joint too!
This is gonna be my spot to play craps, I win here for some reason, maybe because the staff is cool and I felt comfortable not like the strip casinos, I thought this was gonna be a nasty casino but its not. I don't know about the hotel rooms, but the casino is cool. I will be visiting more often during my Vegas summer vacation.
I feel violated and taken advantage of. Last night I asked Barb to get a bottle of water as it was a 100 degrees outside by the pool and needed to hydrate. 30 minutes later Barb returns with 2 bottles of water informing me that she was charged $8.00 a bottle. $16.00 total for the bottles. Seeing as there was no other source for getting water other than paying the ransom she purchased the bottles. This is unethical and price gouging at its worst. Will never return.
At first I was so turned off by this place b/c its kind of like the Walmart of Vegas in terms of hotels. But my friend and I were going to see GNR so we figured lets just make it easy and stat at the HRH this time. The last show we saw there was Motley Crue and we stayed at a hotel down the street but getting a cab back at 3:30 in the morning sucks plus we had to leave the next day so this was an easier option. We booked a room in the Hard Rock Tower and it was spacious with a nice set up and very clean. The lights didn't work in the shower and we couldn't hook up our iPhone 5s to the sound system in the room so that was a bummer but we still liked the set up. . . The pools could be nice b/c they are huge and there are different styles - like one with a sandy bottom, waterfalls, and islands to hang out on. But they are so gross b/c there are way too many people there and it's nasty when you think about what is floating around in there (fecal matter comes to mind - ewwwww!). The worst part about that is you can actually see a bunch of nastiness floating in the pool - oil, what looks to be skin, and hair. It really freaks me out but we knew going there the Hard Rock is known for their party atmosphere especially poolside. In my 20s i would have been into the huge party scene at the pool but being a fresh 40 year old, I am over that stuff. I liked a quiet pool with less people. The Hard Rock is complete opposite - people throwing balls back and forth, everyone is wasted or on their way to that point, music is blaring louder than a night club, and girls grinding on each other to impress tatted out muscle dudes they never met. We spent about 90 minutes poolside each day b/c we went for GNR not for hanging at the pool. . . Mr. Lucky's is the 24 hour restaurant and it's where I had the WORST meal I ever ate. The eggs were chewy and inedible and they even messed up the English muffin. Seriously how do you do that? Plus it was pricey for shitty food. I was most upset that I wasted valuable stomach space but I didn't eat much. I spent $20 for breakfast and was only able to stomach an eighth of it. Wasteful but it was truly one of the worst meals I ever had. Do yourself a favor and do not even bother eating there.. . Fu - we had dinner here one night and none of us was impressed. I guess I had high expectations and was very excited for "Chinese" food but it wasn't good. Out of 4 of us, 1 person liked their meal. The staff was friendly though and the meal wasn't horrible it just wasn't what we were hoping for. . . Culinary Dropout: This is the BEST restaurant at the Hard Rock. They have the best staff - so much fun. We loved our servers and went here 3 times in 2 days! Their happy hour is really good, they make amazing drinks - Bourbon Mules, a Dark and Stormy, or if you fancy tequila they have a great selection of spirits. And all their juices are freshly muddled. Their food is awesome too. For snacks, they make their own potato chips with an onion dip but my favorite thing on their menu are the hot pretzel bites served with a fondue dipping sauce. RIDICULOUS!!!! I ate those 2 nights in a row and could polish off an order all by myself. For happy hour they are half price too!!!  They also have a kick ass kale and corn salad and to-die-for SWEET POTATO CANNELLONI. The pasta is so thin so you can taste the filling which is a beautiful mixture of smoked shallots, mushrooms, snap peas, and parmesan. . . The Joint: I love this venue b/c it's small and the set up is cool b/c everyone has a good seat plus is you want to go to the bar you can still see the stage. Overall, we had a good experience but I would only stay here again if I was going to a show at the Joint b/c it's too far from the strip which limits my feeding choices :O)
This is the best hotel and casino for adults aged 21 - 50, who are looking to party.  Almost everything here is reasonably priced.  . . If you book far enough in advance, it's about $100 per night for a low end room on the weekend and half that on weekdays.  You can get Kettle One vodka cocktails for $6 at the center bar.  The cocktail waitresses will even bring you complimentary grey goose if you're gambling. . . Most of the restaurants here are pretty good and they have a Mr. Lucky's 24/7 where you can eat breakfast, lunch or dinner items anytime.. . The decor is one of the things I love best here.  You will find authentic music memorabilia from hundreds of legends.  For example: Johnny Cash, Queen, Guns and Roses, Nirvana, The Beatles, Tupac, Ice T, Lil Jon, Bob Marley, etc.  You almost feel like you're in a museum here because many of the music exhibits are so robust with memorabilia.. . There are also beautiful people everywhere here and little to no children.  This is my favorite aspect.  Hard Rock invented the "pool party" with Rehab, and you will regularly find an abundance of these beautiful people packed into Rehab during the warmer months.. . Finally, the biggest downside of Hard Rock is the location about a mile off the strip.  So keep in mind you will have to cab everywhere or walk for a half hour just to get to the closest of the big hotel casinos on the strip.  If this place were on the strip, it would get 5 stars from me.
We stayed here in the HRH tower after we did a "drive thru wedding." The suites are huge! It's a perfect spot for gathering a group of friends. The bathroom was my favorite with a HUGE shower and tub. The beds were fluffy and comfortable. We had a corner room so the view was spectacular and it was quiet. If you have the cash, I'd recommend staying here if you can!
We had two rooms reserved at the HRH tower for July 4th weekend for free since my boyfriend's dad comes to Vegas a lot. I was extremely nervous about staying here since almost all the reviews I read were terrible. I mean people were talking about finding poop in their beds! I was pretty terrified! . . As soon as we arrived the front desk people were extremely helpful. We arrived three hours before check in and they had our rooms ready within the hour. Both of our rooms were the double queen poolside suites. They were gorgeous! Very clean and spacious. We have a living room area and a huge bathroom. Although other people have had horrible experiences I really found that our stay was great. The beds were comfortable and everyone in our group was satisfied by the service and the quality of the room especially since they were comped. . . The only downside was that the hotel was so far from the strip but anywhere you stay you still have to take a taxi everywhere so that didn't really bother me. It was a great weekend and I would def come back again!
I'm kinda at a fence when it comes to the Hard Rock. Stayed at this Hotel about twice this year. First time was Super Bowl weekend and most recent was this past July 4th. Rooms are pretty decent depending on what you get. The standard room wasn't jaw dropping and had some issues with it. During my first visit, we stayed at the one of the rooms in the Paradise tower. The carpet was still wet and I disliked the black toilets and black tile shower walls. I'm blind without my glasses or contacts so when I would take a shower, it was even harder for me to see anything because of the black shower tiles. . . This past 4th of July weekend my husband and I stayed at the Gorilla suite on the 2nd floor at the Paradise towers. The room itself was pretty cool. We had our own little patio right next to Rehab. It would have been great to been able to go in and out by the pool as we pleased, but our gate that separated us from the pool was locked. We were told by the front desk that we would be able to have poolside access from our suite but was later told we couldn't. Since our room was next to Rehab the music would be blasting from 10am - 7pm. I didn't mind as much but your the type of person who needs quite time, then this suite is not for you.
I love this place! Heres the rundown:. . Rooms suck, tvs are blurry, the showers dont heat up, pillows will murder your neck. Everything else is awesome!. . The beach pool is awesome!. . Tons of penny slots. . The Luxe bar is by far the best bar. . The food ar culinary drop out is good but outrageously awful customer service. . . Mr. Luckys is Easily the best, most reasonably priced,  place in the hardrock with the best customer service. You have to eat breakfast here! . . During my whole trip I had a burger, a club sandwich, steak and eggs, and a teriyaki bowl at mr luckys and I loved all of it.  Fastest service of any of the hardrock resteraunts too! Youve gotta eat here.
If you're lucky, you will check in with Gary (who rocks- just because he does) and Andrew will be your bartender. . . Overall, Hard Rock was the perfect hotel for the 4th weekend. I loved the room and it wasn't that far from the airport or the strip. . . The only con was the fact that even though a resort fee is required, you don't have access to the "party pool" just the boring family pool. I stayed by the murky pool about 7 minutes. It was whack. . . I would definitely stay at Hard Rock again.
Your cage wait time is the reason I won't mess with you! NO MORE' u guys are progressively getting worse.
Driving through on a road trip and it was cheap. It's nice for the price, I don't understand why people have such high expectations when they're paying $60 for a room + resort fee. That's what a motel 6 will cost you in a small town. Our room was clean and quiet. I was annoyed they didn't let us check in until 3. We got there early (along with many other groups) and unless you upgrade your room, you're room "isn't clean yet". They say they'll call when it's ready but they don't. No refrigerator in the room and it's quite a walk from the strip. We used their free shuttle service but of course it only runs until 5. If I did it again I'd pick something closer to the strip, but it's not a bad hotel for the money.
Nice place, just not my style. When you walk into the room everything is black right down to the ironing board cover.  Its cool for some people, but not me. EVEN THE PEOPLE DRESS IN BLACK,  I should have known then, but didnt pay that much attention. I thought it was a Rock n Roll hotel. This is a Punk Rock hotel.  Im on a paycation and wanted to try a different hotel,  well im living the try something different hotel this weekend... we are in Paradise towers and the rooms are Gothic decor with black batrooms that feel like you are in a mausoleum. The acoustics in the bathroom are awesome. Hey it just hit me Black like a studio. Low lights, No coffee maker in the room, not enough free toiletries...hee hee. Im going to hit up the maid. Im poolside so thats cool. Would I stay here again?   O hell NO!
The HRH is one of my favorites in Vegas.  I don't know why but I'm into the rock and roll vibe.  I've never had an issue with service or conditions but I do know that they draw a younger crowd.  With that comes a lot of booze.  It's not unusual to see bikini clad women stumbling drunk back to their rooms after hanging out at the pool all afternoon.  The poolside dj can be heard from the rooms upstairs.  I guess that could be a drawback but you're not in Vegas to hang out in your room.  The HRH also plays host to concerts.  I was there recently when Widespread Panic was playing and everywhere you went was pot smoke and patchouli.  Again, the HRH is not for the faint of heart.
This place is amazing! Rehab is a good time it's defiantly not what it used to be but still fun and I can't get enough of pink taco! Can't wait to come back!
Completely loved this hotel!. Everyone from the front desk people to the awesome housekeeper Dasiy was amazing.. Checking in was a breeze and so was checking out. The rooms were clean and exactly like the images shown on the site.. The food was extremely overpriced but hey, your in Vegas and it's in a hotel, what do you expect.. The only thing that annoyed me was on my last day we had called to find out about getting a cabana and the lady on the phone (i wish i remembered her name) said that the pools are going to be closed all day for a private event. Well when we were leaving the hotel for something we noticed that the pool was open and so were the cabanas. Needless to say I was pissed as I wanted to do that for my birthday and since we were told it was closed we had made other plans.. Other than that misshap this place was awesome.
We stayed at hard rock for an all girls trip this weekend. Hotel casino is nice and clean - doesn't reak of cigarettes or smoke which is awesome. . It's a far walk through the hotel to get to your room tho- everything's super spread out. . The rooms are decent/nice. Not super fancy or up to date. There's no fridge, microwave or coffee maker. Boooo... and our ice machine never worked on the 14th floor. Annoying. We tried several times every day and it never had ice. . Lame. But other than that not much complaints. Just wish the hotel had complimentary shuttles running to strip. . Rehab pool party was great- gets packed, and was freaking hot! But the pool set up is cool. Played great music, good dancing. Biggest complaint is the ground gets waaaay too hot. The sand burns your feet. Ladies' do not come in heels.... you can't walk in those In sand!
Had a awesome time playing at the craps table, I'm up so I can't complain, it gets pretty live in here with all the pool parties and stuff, rehab and vanity is here. Had alot of fun at rehab, but enjoyed the casino better. All the dealers are pretty cool, me and my buddies enjoyed visiting.
So I had an event in las Vegas and it so happened to on the weekend of EDC ! Any way I decided to bring my two year old, my sister, and a friend our room was amazing the pool was perfect for my little one while I was a the beauty convention my sister said they went to The pool more than once and when I got to the room we when again the place was clean drinks were good its perfect for a girls road trip and family road trip! We can't wait to go again !
Stayed from 7/10-7/13 ...the casino is kind of small but it doesnt have that nasty smell like most hotels do thats a plus. You get free entry into Rehab and Body English after that it was all downhill. Getting to the hotel asked for early check in. I was informed that they would give me a call..so I hit the strip. I never got a call came back around 2 asked why didnt I get a call and guess what a room was ready and they were just abount to call me SO I ended up getting charged for early check in on a not real check in  ..the bathroom is small , the..seen a  couple crickets killed one while i was leaving Friday (had to run so half of it was left) The cleaning people obv didn't do a good job because it was still there when we got back !!. The room was hot and cold..Never staying again ..better off staying on anyhwere on the strip so even if you have these problems you dont have to catch a cab everywhere
My husband and I just returned home from a four night stay at the Hard Rock Hotel, and I couldn't sit down to write this review fast enough.  . We have stayed here nearly every summer for eight years, and have been satisfied with our experiences thus far.  It has always been very simple - no special treatment really, but not drama either -- Until now.  From the get go, we were told that we would be called once our room was available, as we preregistered at 10am.  No biggie.  We just killed time by walking around and stopping for a drink at Culinary Dropout.  By the time 1pm rolled around, I figured I should check on the room to see if it was ready.  When I asked about the room, the lady at the front desk said that it had been ready for a while.  I realized that they were busy (it was a Saturday after all), so I wasn't going to make a stink about the no call.. We got a room in the Casino Tower with a view of the pool - clean and simple - which we were completely okay with.  . The next day, four of my family members came into town.  I had recommended the Hard Rock Hotel to them, which I was kind of nervous about, because they usually stay in the higher end hotels.  We all booked rooms in the Casino Tower several months ahead of time, and ended up in three different towers.  My sister was given a room in the Paradise Tower, which she was not happy with, and my brother and his wife were upgraded to a suite in the HRH Tower, which they loved.  . By the time Monday rolled around, I had booked a pool villa suite in addition to all of our rooms just for Monday night, so that we could enjoy the pool and party in the suite for the day.  I preregistered for the suite Monday around 10am, knowing that it may take a while for the room to actually be ready.  Again, no biggie.  The suite that I wanted (Gorilla Suite) was not available for the night, so I chose the Tree Bark Suite.  I walked around to pool, only to find out that we would not have access to the pool from our patio, as the Breathe Pool was closed, and we would have to walk through the hallway to get to the main pool.  The whole reason I booked the suite was to walk right out of the patio area and have access to the pool - hence POOL VILLA - and when I booked it directly through the Hard Rock reservations, I was told multiple times that we would have an OPEN pool directly outside our patio gate!!  I went to the front desk to express my concerns, and the lady (I'm sorry I didn't get names... ugh) told me that she would have security unlock our patio gate and we would have access to the Breathe pool.  Sweet! I thought.....Right on track.  Until I spoke with the security guy, Pilot, who ended up being the most friendly and helpful person at the Hard Rock.  He told me that the Breathe Pool does not open on the weekdays, and we would not be able to use it, as they did not have a lifeguard on duty.  ((This was not communicated to me in any way shape or form by the front desk staff)).  He apologized profusely on the behalf of the whole hotel and made it a point to try to make me feel better about the situation.  What a guy!  I again, walked to the front desk where I spoke with another young woman.  I began explaining my situation and tried to do what everyone else does when they are unhappy with the hotel.... Get something comped.... in this case.... Maybe a cabana?  WRONG! As soon as I opened up my mouth the woman got stone cold and her eyes glazed over.  I knew there was nothing I could do or say at that point.  Not even hand her some cash.  She was on the dark side.  At that point, we were all pretty much over the idea of a POOL VILLA, so I asked her to cancel the reservation with no penalty, which she did.  I did not once hear an apology from the front desk staff; not even the manager.  . There is a huge communication gap that Hard Rock Hotel should address, and the customer service is hardly up to par.  I appreciate that they did not penalize me for cancelling the day of, but IMO, that should have been expected.. Here is where I wanted to pull my hair out.  My brother in law went to the front desk ten minutes later and explained our story.  He demanded for a comp cabana.....AND GOT IT!  AND also got an apology out of them.  What??? I was glad, but really... How ridiculous!  Couldn't they have saved everyone the headache when I ASKED for it?  I guess you have to act like an A-HOLE to feel like you are a "guest" at the Hard Rock.  Sorry, I don't work that way.  I will take my polite and friendly attitude somewhere else next time.  To sum it all up.... We ended up having a great time at the cabana, but I only have my brother in law to thank for that.  I would have given Hard Rock one star for such poor customer service and lack of respect for their guests, but the second star is only because of Pilot (I give HIM five stars).  Hard Rock.....if you hire more people like Pilot, I may consider coming back.  But not anytime soon.  Sorry!
I don't understand the poor reviews for this place? We spent the night (Thursday) here and it was so fun. Check in/check out was a breeze, the rooms were beautiful, clean, and spacious. The rooms at the hard rock were much better than the Roman tower at Caesars. Check in however on Friday looked horrendous with lines growing faster then the staff could handle. Cab ride to the strip costed us less 8 bucks, 11-12 with tip. 24 hr liquor and subway conveniently located right next to the hotel if you're a tight budget.. . The pros. Pool area- Tropical theme, adult only, offer inflatable balloons to turn the pool into a pool party. (Caesars will actually stop you from "volleying inflatable balls"). Not as big as other casinos= less walking. Cons. Wish the casino area bigger. Tip. Check out on your TV or fill out a card near registration. DON'T WAIT IN LINE!!
Chose to stay here because of its proximity to the Thomas and Mack Center for NBA Summer League.  It's not the cleanest place - toothpaste stain on the bathroom wall, loose hair on the shower wall, cigarette butts and garbage in the hallways. It's got paper thin walls so you can pretty much make out your neighbors' conversations as well as their bathroom visits.  We called the front desk about our neighbors that had kids screaming and running up and down the halls. We wanted a room far away but they instead offered to call them, which they did - we heard their phone ring after all.  The beds weren't that comfortable and there's a strong smell of weed in the hallways.. . The tv's aren't in HD, or if they are something's not right because the picture isn't clear.  The drainage on the sink and bathtub are terrible too, took a good 10 minutes to clean the sink after shaving ie.  waiting for the water to drain.. . Also note they have a policy preventing you from bringing in outside food/drinks but never had a problem bringing water/Coke to our room from outside.  The casino lacked any sort of "buzz" you might find at other casinos.. . Oh and the wifi, part of the resort fee, is terrible. Can't watch a video on YouTube without buffering for a few minutes every 30 seconds.  No wifi outside of the rooms (ie. casino floor and restaurants).  We called for delayed checkout and were told to call back after 6am.. . Overall, it wasn't the absolute worst place to stay but I wouldn't come back.
My team and I went to Vegas for a conference. This hotel is marvelous inside and out, the rooms are cleaned and spacious, we had pool views. We stayed an extra night but in another room, The Executive Suite, this suite is beyond amazing its a 2 story suite with Elevator, living room, full bathroom downstairs and access to the pool. James with front desk helped us very much during our stay. The only thing that they need to have more employees is for Valet parking they are way too slow, I believe we waited for about a good 15 min. Overall this hotel is great!
I really thought this was an awesome hotel. I visited last year for my first time in Vegas and WHOA, I was impressed. The only reason I was forced to take off a star is because of the hotels proximity to the Strip... and when I say proximity, I mean it's not in the proximity at all! However, a quick cab ride and you'll be right on Vegas Blvd with the rest of Hangover crew. Overall, very clean digs and friendly staff. I definitely wouldn't mind staying again.
So I have mixed feelings about this hotel. There is only one pool I could go to even though they had 3 acres of pool space. The restaurants and shops inside were cool and I love how they had like all the rockstar clothes!!!!! The pool that I went in was cold and there was no hot tub! We went over to the Golden Nugget and the pool there was awesome! But that's for a different review... It's good for people 18 and over though but I can only speak for myself...
So where do I start on this review? First off for anyone considering Hard Rock be aware that it is NOT directly on the strip. For me this is a plus,  but this may be disappointing for some.  Also, there are 3 towers. If you want a more calm and luxurious setting then book HRH Tower.  This hotel attracts many young partiers and the majority stay in the Casino and Paradise towers.  Again if you want to avoid this then book HRH. Now people can't claim they didn't know. . . My first interaction with Hard Rock was purely the casino. I was there for a convention and most of its attendees used Hard Rock as their hub for meetups. I did extremely well in black jack and from there my experience just got better.  I had a great dealer that recommend I get a casino host,  so I asked for one. After talking with him we were given 2 nights comped in the HRH tower, this was surely due to the gambling.  I get it, keep them here so they give it all back.  But we had a lot of fun and went home after two extra relaxing days.  . . Tip: if you gamble, GET A PLAYERS CARD.  Hard Rock offers so many comps and deals for people who acrew points.  I have received offers for free chips and shows.  In May we returned,  not for a convention,  but pure relaxation.  My same host got us free tickets to see guns n roses and Jim Jeffries.  We also received 4 days free in a corner suite in HRH. I have gambled in many hotels and I have never received this level of service. My host kept in touch with me the entire time to make sure everything was working out. All in all this is a great hotel which provides spectacular service.
The staff was extremely friendly. This is my favorite hotel to go to when I stay in Las Vegas, and I have stayed at many of the hotels throughout Las Vegas. The condition of the room was perfect and an awesome view overlooking the pools. The front desk team always remembered my name and were extremely nice to me. This hotel is so much fun, I don't mind staying off of the strip as long as the place is a good time with great staff. I highly recommend staying at the hard rock due to the service quality and friendly staff.
I'll give the HRH Tower suites  4 stars only because it was clean, friendly and didn't have a overwhelming cigarettes smoke smell like the other hotels I visited. But I didn't like how you pay so much on a room that was average. Plus you don't get to keep the snacks and stuff they put in the room. (Extra charge) We had gotten to the hotel at our check in time and our room wasn't ready. On top of that they gave us the WRONG room. We had to wait an hour for our room to be ready.  The room music player didnt work. However our room was decent/ nice and clean.
Me and my family came here to rent a hotel at the HARD ROCK hotel and one of the workers just came up to me and basically keep wanting me to show my id many times I felt very discriminated by them. I talk to the AFRICAN AMERICAN security or whatever he is he thinks he owns this place and felt an anxiety from him. I felt harassed and discriminated by this place and I don't recommend the Hard Rock to anyone bad customer service and the staff needs to be retrained.
I think my family and I got lung cancer 2 minutes after walking in the doors. You pay a hefty resort fee per day and the pools close at 7pm... Pissed my kids right off. The remote in our room didn't work. There is NO fridge, which pissed ME right off. We stayed in the Paradise Tower, corner King room. Room was nice and didn't smell of smoke. I wouldn't stay here again
I'm writing this review so that people can be realistic about their expectations.  Hard Rock is not the nicest, or the best, or even one of the best, hotels in Vegas.  But if you are looking for a good hotel with a great price that does the job - Hard Rock is it.   We booked through Expedia and our trip included our flight.  It was a good deal.  My friends booked through a Groupon and stayed in the HRC tower, which is nicer, but I think we got the better deal.  In the Casino tower, which is older, our room was awesome, the bathroom was nice, the bed was super comfy and the view totally sucked.  It was a full view of a roof area with a wall.  We only saw a sliver of sky.  But....because our view sucked, we were able to take a nap on the Saturday we were there and our room was nice and quiet!   (Naps are necessary in Vegas.)  And who spends tons of time staring out their window in Vegas anyway?  Our friends, with their fancy suites in the HRC tower, with views overlooking the great "Rehab" pool party...their rooms were super loud.  Like, major bass and really obnoxious.. . We went to Vegas to celebrate our friend's 40th birthday.  We had a great time, we were there for less than 48 hours.  Hard Rock totally suited our needs.  We ate at Pink Taco for Sunday brunch and were very happy, and the other restaurant there was great as well.  The bars and drinks were ok, and the gambling was pretty average.  I'm taking off a star because checking in (on a Friday afternoon) was kind of a mess.  Long lines, not enough desk agents, and our room wasn't ready by 5pm, which was really crappy!  Check in is between 3-5.  Give people their rooms on time!  When we complained about it, we got a 'I'm really sorry' and that was it.  So...we just got screwed out of some time and no one really cared.  But other than that, pretty awesome trip!  (I wish I could give a 3.5 score, but I'll round up). . (If you really like gambling - stay somewhere else.  Other casinos we visited were way more happening and fun, with more options.  HR is old and off the strip, so the casino wasn't a draw for us.  And if you like a major club-scene pool party - Rehab is it.  It's both weekend days and from the looks of it, people were ready to PARTY at the pool.  We are not into that scene, so we stayed at the quieter, free pool, and had a lovely time.  Although, unless you pay for a cabana, lounge chairs are hard to come by.  If I could do it again, I would just splurge on that.)
We had booked this hotel on Expedia for $37 as we were just stopping in town for a night on our road trip and wanted a cheap and decent place to stay. I was completely freaked out once reading all the awful reviews on here but the cancellation fees were as much as the room itself, so figured we should just go along for the wild ride. . . I was pleasantly surprised once we got into town and checked in. We were offered an upgrade for $20 to the HRH Tower w/ Pool View and King bed. This also allowed us to check in early (arrived at 2:30) and to skip the resort fee of $25 I hear they try to charge. . . Overall the hotel is pretty nice and clean. It seems like they try hard not to have the place reek like cigs, which is a huge plus. Our room was thoroughly cleaned when we got in (and I checked the bed for human shit, after reading the horrible review below). The rooms didn't seem run-down as others have mentioned, and the bathroom was clean and stocked with lots of fluffy towels and shampoo, soap, etc. The decor is not my taste... and it's pretty hilarious that there's an Affliction store in the actual hotel (they still make that stuff?). The wallpaper, decor and general vibe of the hotel is very bro-y, sort of like you stepped back 8 years ago to a MMA convention or something, but i think that's the vibe they're going for. If you have a tribal or koi fish tattoo, enjoy the odd 'roid every now and again, and still wear platform flip flops then you will feel right at home. . . The pool was awesome! We were there on a Thursday (was happy to avoid Rehab) and there was a perfect amount of people there to keep it fun but not crazy. . . The only critiques I would have are the drinks and food are pretty expensive, but honestly that's expected here. Considering we paid $60 for the room we didn't feel too ripped off paying for $16 margeritas. That and the fact that it's a bit far from the strip, but if that's what you're looking for then this is a great place to stay for probably pretty cheap. Don't let the bad reviews fool you!
A great place to stay. Solid prices for outstanding perks. Just off the strip , so not alot of tourist foot traffic. A 3 minute cab ride gets u to the Cosmo , so that is fine .Mr Lucky is a classic place and reasonablly priced.very friendly staff at Pink Taco ,  Jerry at the bell desk was outstanding . Great memorabilia on casino floor, great atmosphere , and 5 star pool .HRH Tower , around a 100 a night , feels like a celebrity style room. Quiet neighbors , fast elevators ,  Deep bath tub , rain style shower head and two flat screens. Only complaint is that the original pool seems to be off limits nowadays unless u have deep pockets or status.. will be back soon.
I booked a room in the HRH tower because of the description of the customer service as well as the rooms, which are all suites. When I arrived they had just let my friend upgrade her room for a room from a casino tower king to the same room we had reserved. She was immediately taken to her room while we were told to wait 1-3 hours. When we finally got to our room, our couch smelled of animal and urine, the bathroom light didn't work, the shower head fell off and one of the curtain rods fell off. We then asked for another room and were told none on the same floor were available. I then spoke with a manager who "moved some things around" and got another room on the same floor. We've now waited over an hour for our new room and after flying all day with my one year old son this is extremely exhausting and beyond ridiculous.
The room is a basic no frills room. It is dusty as hell though! There's a layer of dust on everything! Stayed in the Paradise Tower and the room needs updating. Cabinets are all beat up, shower fixture is breaking, one lightbulb is out.. It's dark in here!. The view is good though.. The pools are neat with the sand and all. You can't bring your own drinks down to the pool unless you buy their HR Rehab cups.. Not bad for $39 per night though.
Got a great deal on Priceline for a 2-night weekday stay.  I was in Vegas on business & was happy to stay at what I thought was one of the most popular & hip hotels in Vegas.  The room was great--Rock & Roll theme & I loved all the Rock & Roll displays throughout the hotel!  But, the casino, for the most part, was dead!  No matter what time of the day or night, there were very few people around.  Because the hotel is NOT on the Strip, it was a long & not very friendly walk to get where the action was.  Maybe there's some reason the casino was dead & I just don't know the reason.  Maybe this explains why I got such a great deal on Priceline!
