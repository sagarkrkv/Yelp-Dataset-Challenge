After all my trips to Vegas, I always wanted to try something that I could only get in Vegas, so I've steered away from Tacos El Gordo. After my drunk friends kept talking about tacos ALL NIGHT at the club, we decided to leave the club early to eat here. After leaving Encore, some of us stumbled to Tacos El Gordo to grub on some Adobada (Spicy Pork) Fries and Asada tacos. The Adobada was very good although some pieces were dry. I've had better Asada, but when it's doused in guacamole and sour cream, it'll taste x times better.
Mulitas de adobada are the best. Adobada is pork meat marinated. You can order tacos, sopes, french fries, french fries with meat on them, quesadillas and a few other stuff. There can be a very big crowd at times. I fined if it is less crowded during the day and during the week. The tacos are street style tacos very much like they sale in Mexico.ENJOY
Spicy pork/adobada is so good!! Moist and so flavorful. The avocado sauce (I think it's avo sauce) is so amazing too! . . At 1:30AM it wasn't too bad of a line. Waited maybe 20 minutes. But it's worth it! There's separate lines for each type of meat you want so read that before standing in line. Wish they had chicken, but only beef and pork )= They ask you what you want and if you want all the toppings (cilantro, onions, avo sauce). You order, they give you the food, you walk to the back and pay. It's efficient. They'll put foil over it when u pay if you're doing to-go. There's a tented area in the front to sit and eat but it's crowded. . . Since we went at night the heat inside wasn't too bad, but there is NO air conditioner. Just fans, so it's stuffy. Probably so bad during the day time in the summer. No water out or anything either, and drunk people and heat don't mix well.  Saw a drunk guy totally pass out and hit the floor waiting in line. Heard a big thump when his head hit :/ he got up with a huge bump on his head and they called an ambulance. Hope you're okay whoever you are! Too bad you didn't get to try the amazing tacos.
food is AMAZING!  . . i love getting the steak tacos and the price is very affordable. . $2 tacos!!. . they open late night so definitely check it out
Coming from someone who isn't really a fan of Mexican food, this has got to be my favorite place for tacos! Every time I'm in Vegas, I have to stop here. . . Although the lines are always extremely long, I feel the carne asada tacos are worth the wait. They have two different lines for certain types of meats, so make sure you're in the right line! . . Give their carne asada fries a try too! But a half order should be enough for two people for it's really filling.
I found myself walking by this place late at night on the way back to my hotel and decided to give it a shot.. . Simply delicious.  Great place for a casual meal while in Vegas.. . Only very minor drawback is that the seating area is a bit on the warm side (it's July), but the tacos were so good I scarfed them in just a few minutes anyway.
I make it here every time I go to Vegas. Prices are reasonable, and the tacos are authentic. They have different lines for the different type of meats so make sure that you get in the right line. I saw someone get in the wrong line and had to move and start over again. The people making the tacos were pleasant to deal with. The location and condition of the building is not the greatest. In fact, it's really run down, and they don't have air conditioning, but if you can live with that, the tacos are delicious.
Best original mexican tacos in Las Vegas - does not get better then El Gordo's!
Well My husband wanted to try this place since a friend told him these were the best tacos in town.  uh huh.... . . So he tried the buche, and tripas (eewww really???!!!) tacos and I had the Carne Asada and al Pastor Tacos. ... . . Carne asada tacos were nothing to go crazy for... meh. . Al Pastor tacos, were amazing!  the meat was soft and with all the fixin's (salsa, guacamole...etc) it was like heaven.  :-) . . My husband LOVED the buche and the other stuff he ate, again disgusting! but hell he loved it so I guess this place gets only 4 stars for me.... The Asada tacos were not mind blowing like we were told.  :-)
yum yum yum mexican food just off the end of the strip (:. . For carne/beef, line up on the left.  For pork, line up on the right!  My usual order is something like 2 adobados + 1 carne + 1 lengua taco (have a friend order all the carne, and another order all the adobados, otherwise you will have to line up twice!). . This is a must-go if you are in vegas - cheap, delicious, tasty tasty food! Convenient parking, available seating.  What more can you ask for?. . Last time I came, however, half of their kitchen had been closed down for some reason and the wait time was ridiculous (close to an hour around lunch time).  On previous visits, my wait has always been around 20 minutes long around the same time (we have a habit of going right after hotel check-out, before driving back to socal!)  So that would be the only partly off-putting thing.  Fingers crossed for having the whole place back up and running again by the next time I visit!
Hint: Don't come here when you're hungry, if you have kids/a large group of people, or if anyone you are with is in a bad mood/ pissed off!. My family and I went on 4 th of July & it was an hour and a half wait for food! It was highly amusing (for me) to see people getting all crazy and in fights over waiting for tables and just being aggro over the loooong waits.. . Yes, it's crazy-mad mayhem, dirty, & a pain in the ass to get a table... but it's a meal/experience you won't forget! . Definitely go in with more than 1 person, because you have to wait in separate lines for different menu items!. . You HAVE to order the Adobada (spicy pork) tacos! They were the best thing we ate~ we tried all the different tacos and the Carne Asada fries. I don't know if it's cuz we were staving or if it's really that good,  but we all agreed that the food was awesome (2 friends with us that night we from Mexico, & they confirmed that those Adobada tacos were BOMB!!!)!. . So if the line isn't too bad and you're looking for some authentic Mexican tacos when you're in Vegas, this place is definitely a must!
After going here once, this place has easily become one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. My friends and I came here once for lunch after a night at EDC since it was a short walk from Circus Circus.. . We arrived at about 2:30pm and the lines were out the door. There were multiple lines: one for carne asada (beef), one for adobada (spicy pork) and one for lengua (beef tongue) + everything else. My friends and I all split into different lines. The adobada and carne asada line took ~45 mintues to order, whereas the lengua line didn't even take 15.. . I ended up asking my friends to get me something from each line.. . Carne Asada Fries ($10): The beef itself was really good. Super tender and just absolutely melts in your mouth. The fries, on the other hand, were nothing special. The fries comes with cheese, sour cream and guacamole (although I don't think we got the guac.). . Adobada Taco ($2) and Quesadilla ($4): Easily my favorite. Definitely worth the wait for this. The spicy pork was probably the best I've ever tasted at any Mexican restaurant. It was the right amount of spicy and OMG was it juicy.. . Lengua Taco ($2.25): The lengua here is a really close second to the adobada. The meat is super juicy (like all the others lol) and there is a lot of flavor.. . Pork Shoulder Taco ($2): My least favorite out of all the meats, but still really good. It's basically like pulled pork, I would say. There isn't as much flavor in this compared to the other meats, but still, the meat melts in your mouth.. . Even though waits can be long, I would absolutely come back here. It's SO cheap for the amount that they give you.. . Notes:. - They give a lot of toppings on EVERYTHING.. - You order the food at the counter and then pay at the registers by the door. Kinda awkward when there's hella people in line and you're just trying to get through to pay.. - Open super late Fridays and Saturdays.
My favorite place for tacos in Vegas! Asada tacos and mulitas are my favorite! Along with the guacamole they top them off with. Customer service was great. The girls where very friendly. The place was full of customers the whole time we where there. They really do bring the flavor from Tijuana. This is a must!
The place can get crammed with people but the wait is worth it. Easily up there with some of my favorite al pastor spots in CA. And it's always a plus when they don't charge extra for guacamole like most places do. The pastor was flavorful and plenty juicy. The salsa was great too, had some kick but won't set your mouth on fire. This will be my go-to spot for tacos next time in Vegas.
Since I have eaten their tacos, nothing has ever compared! The best tacos ever!! I went back the following day to make sure the food was that delicious and I wasn't just drunk, and sure enough it was delish! Awesome prices and fresh food.. The employees work hard and are very friendly. Love this place!
Still really good flavor but not as good as Cali :(. The meat seems to be different but the guacamole, marinade, and salsa make up for it.  But after a long night in Vegas I'm sure it hits the spot.
So, I had to come to Vegas to discover a restaurant that is also in San Diego!!!  Found this place mentioned as a top choice on several websites, especially when researching the best cheap eats in Vegas.  Granted, they are not necessarily cheap for street tacos ($2 to $3), but compared to prices in Vegas as a whole, Tacos el Gordo is a bargain!  During a lunch break during a business conference at the LV Convention Center, my friend and I came here.  Expecting huge lines, we prepared for a long wait, but it turned out that lunch time is a pretty good time to visit.  According to my friend, the lines are absolutely huge during the late night hours, after the clubs get out.  Anyway, I ordered two of their famous spicy pork tacos, one beef shoulder taco, and, because I wanted to be adventurous, one beef brain taco.  I had each one "with everything" and all of them were delicious!  Without a doubt, the two pork tacos were the absolute best...sweet, savory, spicy...full of flavor!  The beef shoulder was excellent to, a bit stringy, but overall very tasty.  The brain taco was...interesting.  With all of the accompanying toppings, it was very tasty, but it was the texture that was the most different.  Creamy is probably the best word to describe it.  Would I order one again?  Probably not, but I am very glad that I tried it.  Was it filling?  After eating my four tacos, I felt thoroughly satisfied.  I was by no means full, but happily fed(for about $10 mind you) and looking forward to a future visit.  . . When in Vegas, I will visit again and now that I know that they are also in my home town, I will be making a drive down there soon as well!
This place is off the chain! Tacos for days! Super good and the taco selection is awesome!! Asada, tripa, lengua, and steak fries! If you want some tacos come here! Tends to get full so prepare for a line to get some food. Outside sitting and the toppings are great too! Enjoy this taco paradise !
Wow it gets worse. i wasnt a fan of this place before and i keep coming back but it SUCKS . first off theres no AC on a nice hot summer day in las vegas. they have some horrible air machine that blows the hot ass hair on your back. . the people who go there are mostly ghetto , last time i was there i saw ANOTHER fight break out in the tent then the dumb security comes and pepersrpays everyone so the spray gets in our food and eyes and nose, my eyes start to hurt and everyone starts sneezing... come on , so ghetto. the lines are CONFUSING . . theres a damn long line for carne asada and another for the al pastor. ARE YOU GUYS STUPID? dont do that. . this place is aweful its a mess its dirrty and looks like a dump. its TRASH dont go here the food is average but everything else sucks . stay away . . oh and bring someone who speaks spanish or else good luck. . god i hate this place ghetto and dirty
200+ people in there, their cafeteria set up ends up becoming one long long line per meat type and theeen you pay at another line.. So I did as many others were doing, ate my tacos before paying, which pissed off the cashier and a couple of the workers so now everyone was happily joined in pissedoffness over their ridiculous set up. Maybe after giving away tacos and giving customers and workers a terrible time, they'll get smart and do business the normal way. The tacos were good of course,(anything is good in a tj style steamed meat greased tortilla) but not worth the hour you'll waste trying to get a couple of different meats.. I suggest driving a little further down to Charleston ave where the other gordo is at, wich is busy, but you'll be eating in ten minutes tops.
shitty service overated!!! unorganized service.. food was edible but nothing spectacular. carna asada was dry and chewy. waited for 2 hours in line way over hyped. ridiculous!!!! not recommended!!! do not listen the lady that moves you to the other line!!!
In terms of value this is my favourite restaurant in Vegas. The best tacos Ive ever had for $2 a pop. I would definitely recommend the Adobada tacos with everything on them, but its hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.. . Some downsides are that El Gordos always seems busy and it is probably not the most efficient ordering experience if you want multiple kinds of tacos given that there are separate lines depending on what you are ordering. If you are going as a couple or as a group I would suggest coordinating your order and splitting up amongst the lines. . . Even with the downsides the tacos are always worth it though. Just a fantastic, genuine, taco shop with no frills. Tacos El Gordo is a must eat for me whenever I'm in Vegas. Perfect for lunch or post Vegas shenanigans late night eats.
i love this place when i'm not sober. sooooooo gooooooood. Came here 3 times today. And I'm probably coming back for more.
Had the pleasure of trying Tacos El Gordo and it was definitely worth the wait you have to endure if ordering lengua, buche or tripa. . . The lengua was one of the better ones I have ever had. Soft, tender and tasteful so it  was well worth the wait. The grilled onions, radishes made a perfect combo with the lengua.. . The tripa, which I had not had in a while, was perfect. It was crispy, chewy and just enough salt to being it all together. . . Having to wait for service isn't terrible because it is a small place and what looks like a popular destination. Definitely a place to try if Mexican is desired.
Walked over here with my gf before the mad lunch rush.  This place gets crazy busy, so be prepared to wait in a disorganized line.  I prefer the SD location because it seems more hole in the wall.  But, still the tacos here are awesome!  My favorites are the lengue, pastor, cabeza and asada.
While your in Vegas do yourself a favor and start going north on Las Vegas Blvd. Once you see a strip mall near crappy hotels like The Riviera and Circus Circus you're at Tacos El Gordo. Tacos El Gordo is a Tijuana taco joint that is also now in the U.S. They have locations in San Diego, Vegas and Temecula. Having tried the real deal in TJ, I was skeptical that the Vegas one would not be as good. But it is just as good. When you first walk in its a little hectic and confusing. They have separate lines for different meats.  All the tacos are good but their best is the Al Pastor or Adobada. It's a  thinly sliced marinated pork on a rotating spit. Make sure to order plenty of tacos and ask for the green salsa and cebollitas (onions) and chiles.  I also highly recommend the Adobada quesadilla and Adobada fries which is French fries with a ton of Adobada meat. This place is heaven for any taco loving glutton. I've had tacos all over Mexico and can honestly say these are the best tacos you will find in the United States. I was trying to keep this place a secret but judging from the lines there and number of reviews the secret is out. The Vegas location is full of tourists so it's key to go there at the right time which is early for lunch or early evening for dinner. During the 2am drunken hour this place is a zoo.
Fabulous food for those going from the sublime (Encore by Wynn across the street) to the local and not ridiculous. Very serious taco lovers only.  No new age veggie or chicken; the quesadilla de lengua (tongue) is specialty.  We loved sopa de chorizo b/c the mamasita is making fresh corn sopas as you watch. Fresh. Delicious. Satisfaction guaranteed.
Brains!!! . . That's what sealed the deal for me as soon as we walked up and I saw the menu. I Immediately ordered six and I wasn't disappointed one bit. . . As with most other taco places I've been to, they had a salsa bar with all the fixings. I usually go to for limes, onions, and cilantro. So, I topped my brain tacos and dug in. They were rich, creamy, and delicious.. . As for the place itself, it was clean, the staff was friendly, and packed with people! All a good sign in my book. I'm happy we made the decision to stop. If you're ever in Vegas, you should too!
I don't see what everyone is talking about!  First off their ordering system sucks! You have to wait in three different lines depending on which meats you want. By the time you get your food from one line and have to order in the other your food is cold.  Then you still have to wait in another line to pay. Second, they use chuck steak!  A carne asada taco consists of flap skirt/Ranchera meat.  Third, the al pastor tasted like a piece of sweet thanksgiving ham and they smothered it with a green moco looking sauce. Fourth, the lengua was kept in a boiling pot of lard.  Lengua is boiled then kept steamed, not kept warm in lard.  The tripas tasted like they were not clean and when I asked if they were crispy he said, "yes", but were soggy.  The cabeza was also kept in the lard to keep warm.  I know mexican and this was not!  I come from Guadalajara where the street tacos are amazing and when I seen they had "Vampiros" I was super excited. Until they came out.  The cheese was not good and they packed it with a pound of pico de gallo that made what should have been a crispy tostada a soggy tortilla!  Will NEVER return!
Not the worst, but DEFINITELY not worth the trip north of strip! First off, the meat is NOT carne asada. It is chuck steak. The ordering system is horrible. Three lines for each meat. If you want more than two meats, then your food will be cold. The chile was whack. If you want real San Diego Mexican food, try Roberto's. It's opposite end of strip. In between Mandalay Bay and South Pointe. I've lived in SD before and they have the best! Better than. LA!!!
Pastor Tacos are AWESOME here. Well worth the wait!!! We look forward to coming here when on Vegas.
Everyone raves about their adobada but I think their cabeza is by far the best meat !! Two cabeza tacos and a small order of any meat fries will surely send you straight back to your hotel room with a big smile and a little faint. Gordos is a nice 10 minute walk from encore beach club so stuffing your face here after starving yourself is the best way to end the afternoon
I don't get it. There shouldn't be a great chain taco place in a well-touristed location such as the Strip, but here it is.. . Tacos El Gordo has been one of my bookmarks for a long time, yet somehow it wasn't until I was literally half a mile away that I decided it was worth the trip. I'm really glad I made that oh-so dreadful drive.... . Even though I've been to similar places, it took me a while to order. I wasn't sure why everybody was piled up on one side of the ordering area. And then there was the empty ordering station on the right edge, which threw me off further. Eventually, I did find my way to the open al pastor station and the open assorted cuts station, and I got my tacos.. . After paying (cash only, $2+tax per taco), snapping photos, and finding a seat (outside the off-peak yet still packed restaurant in this awesome tent with two heavy-duty fans and real tables), I dug in and enjoyed delicious bite after delicious bite. And yes, I can review meat by meat because I asked the guy in the kitchen to point out which was which. And I may have eaten some of these before.. . - Sesos: braaaaains. You, too, can be a zombie! This is pretty creamy. Makes sense, because it's cow brains. (Not sure I can compare the flavor to anything, just try if it you haven't and aren't squeamish. And no, i don't have mad cow disease yet.). - Cabeza: tender head meat. From a cow. You can taste salt but it's not salty. Came with a green salsa, same one as on the cesos taco, and diced onions and cilantro, same mix as they provide on all tacos.. - Al pastor (adobada): I've had the unfortunate experience of overcooked, dry, salty pork at other places. Not here. I actually saw the meat bubbling on the vertical spit, and it tasted delicious. They actually have a medium spiciness red salsa under the almost neon green, sweet sauce.. . (Funny story with that al pastor. There weren't pineapples, so I asked if it came with them. Al pastor guy goes to the fridge and unwraps the foil from a large piece of pineapple, then sticks the pineapple on top of the vertical spit, and carves off a nice hunk from it. Just throws it on the taco, which I didn't mind since I can portion control with my incisors. A minute later, as I'm ordering at the adjacent station, the pineapple somehow comes flying into the boiling tray of meats and splashes liquid all over the sneeze guard. Dude didn't know where it went and looked around for a while until he finally saw it. Boiling tray station employee grabbed it for him and returned it.. . Anyway, back to the rundown.). . - Tripas: pretty salty, not as intestinal as you might expect, crunchy from being fried, comes with that red salsa from above. I'd get it again, probably.. - Suadero: beef shoulder. Best purely savory thing that I tried here. It's beef, and you can feel the meat fibers, but it's still quite tender.. - Buche: chewy, visible stomach lining. Little salty and perhaps acidic, which isn't that surprising since it's, well, a pig stomach. Don't confuse it with pork belly, because that's something else entirely.. . Huge credit to Tacos El Gordo for offering a quality, cheap product, especially on the Strip. I'd definitely come back here or check out their other Las Vegas location the next time that I'm thinkin' tacos (probably for cabeza, al pastor, suadero, and the lengua that I skipped out on). I'd also try the San Diego locations too if somehow I managed to check out all the other popular spots first.
We were there on Saturday night around 7. We knew about Tacos El Gordo because we've been to the Charleston location on many occasions. The Strip location is just as good, but not surprisingly crazy busy on a Saturday. There's no seating inside this location, just a tent with a handful of tables out in front. At least the tent has swamp coolers inside to keep it habitable inside.. . The wait seemed interminable, even with five lines going at once. I don't know why, but it seemed that the kitchen line was stalled for about 10-15 minutes while they were taking care of something or other back there. Once the line got moving it went quickly, but the 15 minutes in the swarm of people, even in a partially air-conditioned building, was no fun. We ended up getting our 5-year-old son an helado from the freezer and let him eat it (yes, we paid for it, but after it was gone).. . The wait notwithstanding, the food at TEG is great. It is usually worth the wait, though on this day and considering the extra delay, it was slightly less so. We did, though, have happy tummies afterward, so all in all, it's still near the top of my list.. . Still, though, on a Saturday, I would take the extra time to drive up to the Charleston location. I doubt that the extra driving time would be any less than the wait in line on the Strip.
Look - I know one assumes that a 5 star meal in Vegas will always break the bank. Gordo is here as living proof that the assumption does not always stand.. . One of the BEST MEALS I had on my trip. Tacos Azteca were some of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. The experience itself was great too. A little weird at first (you have to stand on different lines depending on what you want) but you'll get it. And you'll be happy you made the trip up the block.
The best real and authentic Mexican tacos.. You must try this place on the strip they stay open until 4am! I love it I'm decently going back to this spot the food here is simply amazing!!
My new MUST stop when I go to Vegas (It used to be Earl of Sandwich and Fat Tuesdays). I am one of those people who like to try weird stuff so as soon as I saw the menu I got excited. I got: Tripa, Sesos, Lengua, Cabeza, Adobada, and Carne Asada. I loved all of them specially the Adobada and the Sesos!! I also like the fact that they give you grilled green onions with you food! Amazing and made to order.
The first time I went here, a long time ago, the lines were so long and confusing because we didn't know how to handle going from each station that we just gave up and left. Now I've been to the other location on a taco crawl I knew what to expect when our friends asked us to come grab tacos here. . . We go in line for the al pastor as that was the majority of what we needed, then tipped out the station for them to get the other stations to make our other tacos simultaneously and tip out those stations as well. Or if you are in a group of friends, have someone in each line ordering for the group and split the cost among yourselves. We were here at 11ish and the line took 25 minutes. . . I had - . . Al pastor - this pastor was decent. Not too fatty, the seasonings were good. I like the avocado sauce they put on it, as well as the salsa on it. Ask for pineapple too! I think if I go here, I will probably just get this meat in various vessels (tacos, vampiros, fries, etc). . . Cabeza - there was crispy edges to this which was different. The flavor of it was just OK though and there are cabezas I far prefer around town. I noticed they dip the tortillas at this station in the grease for flavor, but that made my taco also a bit soggy. It was better the last time I had them. . . I got a plate of the green onions and peppers as well (these are free) and the green onions is probably my favorite thing about this place. . . I don't want to do this very often as I absolutely hate the cattle line system. Maybe I'm coming off like a brat, but I've stood in lines for many of foods with zero complaints as there are some things worth the inconvenience and time spent. These are good tacos, but not the greatest taco in town as they are hailed to be. Great late night spot, specially for tourists, but I will rarely visit and will go to the Charleston one if I can help it.
A notch lower than the one in Chula Vista definitely, because the pork goes on the grill for a little bit before reaching your taco, rather than cutting it right off the rotating roaster and dropping into the taco.. . in order from best to good. . 1 - Spicy Pork Tacos. 2 - Lengua Tacos. 3 - Shoulder Tacos. . quite honestly I would recommend getting 4 spicy pork tacos and 2 lengua tacos for yourself.  ask your friend to simultaneously line up for a different ingredient so you don't have waste time standing around
The lines to order are very confusing and they are slow as hell. I think there overated and the people who wo r ks there aren't friendly at all. Customer's service is terrible.
The tacos are good.. the vampiro is the best one but this place is a mad house! There are different lines for different meats and when its busy this place is smoked up, cramped, and hot. I don't think it's worth the insanity at all
The food here is great! The carne asada fries are amazing and just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Sooo why the 3 stars? The process to order here is not practical for the customer. There are diffrent lines based on what kind if tacos you want. If you want carne asada AND al pastor tacos u may have to get in line again because each line is specific for the meat. The lines are also fairly long no matter what time I've gone here (2 am or 5pm).
My must go to place whenever I'm in Vegas! It's fast, fresh, easy & affordable. Adobada tacos, fries, errthang! It's the meat I only and always get ... I've just recently discovered you can request pineapples on your tacos; tried it & it was delish :p  -don't forget the grilled jalapeno & iced horchataaaaa
I walk in on a warm Summer Tuesday night at 11:30pm and look at the ridiculous set up of different lines for different meats and I and many others are overwhelmed.  It takes an hour to finally get to the counter and get my food. The tacos de adobada (al pastor) are nothing to write home about and much less spend an hour in line for. They were OK. If you think these tacos are 100% authentic tacos al pastor or arabe or adobada.....whatever you want to call them. You have not tried 100% authentic street style tacos. Even L.A.'s famed King Taco blows this place out of the water. Not worth it. P.S. I saw many people ordering food and not paying for it.
We were walking up the strip and came upon this taco place that has been raved about on Yelp and by some friends we know. Naturally, we had to eat there given the circumstances: tipsy, tired, and the great reviews.. . We ordered two tacos and a mulita each, plus a coke. Of course it's Vegas, so the tacos were way higher priced than your normal King Taco. That's something I don't care about if the food is delicious. Unfortunately, the meat was so bland! The only thing we tasted were the onions and cilantro. That's it!. . I'm not so sure they season their meat, but we were very disappointed!
Great south of the border tacos. Also go next door to the souvenir store and buy your cold beer to go with your tacos. They just got their alcohol license today. Heaven sent.
One of the best places to eat in Vegas period. Always packed and can be a little confusing for first timers as hordes of people seem to be haphazardly standing in random locations but fear not there is an order to the madness. There are different lines for each of the different meats. I'd say the hectic atmosphere even adds to the charm of this place. Great place to end a drunken night or grab a cheap but delicious bite. Order the Pastor with pineapple!
Great tacos! Long lines! They are worth the wait! I had chicken tacos and carne asada fries and Wow I loved them.  I don't so much like the wait but if you are looking for great Mexican food, a must try.
Was really excited to try this place after hearing my friend rave about it and knew i had to come try it for myself.. my friend got the carne asada fries and I got two carne asada quesadillas..I was not impressed... maybe because there was a long line but when I got my tacos the meat was completely burned and hard.
This place was the highlight of my Vegas trip. . This place is clutch. . Every night after a  night of drinking I would cab it to this spot, have a feast..Then walk to my hotel for about 45min. No hangovers...And I'm hangover prone...clutch I tell you.. . I'm going to describe the food with one word "phenomenal"!!!!. . Best Al pastor tacos I ever tasted, always loaded with plenty of pineapple slices.. . Love, Love, Love this place.
Delicious food, but confusing process. This place was jammed pack, but rightfully so!
Hands down best tacos that you can get in the USA.. . They are the normal size, so small. But we got them with everything on them and the salsa and cilantro were super fresh and great. . . We order the abadoba & CARNE Asada tacos. I also ordered a quesadilla and tostada and they aren't worth the extra 2 bucks. Just go the right way with the tacos, they are amazing.. . Pay attention to the lines they are confusing.
Im not sure why this place has more than 2 stars, its not that good, OK at best. Maybe if you never had Mexican food before than that would make sense. . . To start, the lines are confusing and chaotic!The tacos, were made inconsistent, some had not enough meat some had no guacamole some had one tortilla and some had two. The meat, was dry with no taste. . . The price at $2.00 a taco off the street should be a Very Good taco, this is not even close, its more of a $1.00 taco!. . So many other places are much better. I don't get it.
I couldn't tell if I was still drunk or hungover. Either which, my diminished blood sugar filled rage went ahead and decided to order everything I possibly could.. . The neat thing about this place is that they separate the lines into three, so different stations serve different items. I didn't dare venture into the soup looking thing, so I stuckto the tacos and loaded french fries.. . For the price, venue, and how drunk I was this place was freaking awesome.
I waited until my last day in Vegas to try this spot because I knew I would pig out. I was so excited to eat here. I was hoping it wouldn't be too long of a wait because I was starving! . . The place is right next to Encore. Towards the end of the strip. There is a red rent outside for outside seating. When you walk in there are several lines. There's a line for asada and adobada fries. A line for carne asada tacos and Mulitas and a line for adobada and al pastor Mulitas and tacos. Then a seperate line for anything with buche, suadero, and tripa, lengua. This was the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. I would rather just order my food and have them call out my number when it's ready. But in a way if works for Vegas craziness. . . The prices for the tacos are a bit higher than usual. Tacos are about $2. Mulitas $4, fries $10. . . I tried the adobada fries and these were delicious with a decent amount of meat topped with sour cream and guacamole and cheese.. . 2 al pastor tacos. Topped with onion, cilantro and guacamole. So delicious. Perfect size too. . . I also had a Mulita with tripas. So delicious. The Mulitas are small but since I had tacos tok I was satisfied. . . This is a place you need to come to while in Vegas. The food is great and it's also affordable compared to other places on the strip. The food is also very authentic. . . Besides the different lines just one other thing to complain about... The soda machine ran out of ice and it took a really long time to get ice.
Whoever knows mexican food should know this place is fukn AWESOME!! the best !! The asada fries are pricey but keep in mind they have a small order which is still a good amount for $5 ... These are true TJ tacos ! I never leave vegas without eating here!
We came here specifically for the Adobada Tacos. My girlfriend has been raving about this place since we started dating because apparently there is one in San Diego and it has the best Tacos in that nation. When we had arrived on a Monday afternoon, it was still packed! At that moment I was pretty excited to try the Adobada tacos because people were lining up for this place on a weekday. . . Finally we had arrived at the counter and had ordered 3 Adobada tacos each person and it did not disappoint! It was by far the best tacos I have eaten. We both pretty much inhaled it in a matter of minutes. The Adobada tacos because the meat was cooked to perfection and the sauce was on point. We also got the Horchata to wash it down. Best combo! This place definitely worth the hype and worth the wait. I'm glad we came here and will definitely be visiting this place again.. . I can't wait to come back and order their other signature dishes!. . TACO HEAVEN :). . 5 Stars!
Oh Tacos El Gordo. Really sucks that you're located on Las Vegas Blvd where every tourist and their mom wants to try your delicious tacos. And it also sucks that you have bad air circulation, barely any AC, and barely any place to park. However, your tacos are the boooommbbb diggity and this is why you deserve all the stars. Nothing about the food needs to be changed... the adobada, lengua, and tripa tacos are all seasoned perfectly and melt-in-you-mouth and I would recommend them to anyone. What you do need to change is the ordering process. Long lines with bad air circulation and sweaty people do not make for happy customers such as myself. Thus, because of this I will not be coming back.
I went here like 3 times the last time I went to Vegas and it was so goooooddd !! I've never been to a taco place that includes guacamole without an extra cost. This is a real authentic taco place, and it's cool to see them prepare it right in front of you. When I go back to Vegas, this will be my first stop!
found this place using Yelp. this place is always busy for a good reason. the tacos are great and for a fair price for being on the strip. the only thing is that the lines are confusing.  Depending on what type of meat you want you have to stand on different lines. it is more confusing when you don't know where to pay especially with the amount of people ordering food. sitting is easier to find outside in the heat then inside. I still recommend this place. great food.
Love taco el gordo best flavor out there from it's Tj location to Nevada . . BUT HERE ME PLEASE:. You need one line to order. A separate line for each item you order. By doing that i wait 30 min Carna Asada Taco line then 30 min for Adobada Taco line
The best tacos in Las Vegas! ! Takes you back to Tijuana style. We had carne asada mulitas and al pastor tacos,  really good and tasty :)
Overall: still the best late night tacos. . . Pros. -abodabo. -al pastor. . . Cons. -buche is extra funky, not my fav here but others liked it. - tripa, again not a fan. . Sidenote:. - if you like eating innards you probably will enjoy the buche and tripa. - if you are getting crazy amounts of food, be sure to get a tray
La madre santa de Dios que es un taco bueno! Have you ever had a taco so good that you spontaneously start speaking spanish? Yeah. Who knew a $2 taco could turn you into a cunning linguist? I don't know what it is about Tijuana street food but boy are we glad they set up shop here in Las Vegas! Tacos El Gordo... Go! Go there now! Holy mother of God that's a good taco!. . As we Mexican food aficionados, we were more than thrilled to finally find some good grub here in Vegas. For a mere two dollars you can get carne asada tacos, tacos de cabeza, tacos de lengua, and our personal favorite, tacos adobada (spicy pork). When you walk through the door you will immediately be greeted by the beautiful adobada roasting on a spit. Now really. Who doesn't like beautiful pork spinning about on a spit?. . Warning! Don't be distracted by the $10 fries! This is a distraction for gringos! Your mission is tacos, tortas, sopes, and more tacos! All much cheaper than the gringo fries and much more delicious! So get in your car and get your ass to Tacos El Gordo!
It was really busy late night on Saturday. It took  over 30 minutes for the 3 of us to get 12 tacos because of their line system. That did not bother me very much though; it was the cashier who counted the number of tacos herself, overcharged me an extra taco, and failed to give my receipt when I paid for my food. After getting seated, I realized that had happened. I quickly went back to the cashier to let her know so I can get a free soda since I didn't want to wait in line for a taco.  Due to the language barrier, a coworker of hers explained the situation. The cashier refused to admit she overcharged me and did not do a single thing to make matters better, even after I did the math and showed her the amount I was charged in my credit card. If it were an accident, that's totally understandable. I think it was intentional. On the flip side, I really enjoyed the tacos despite the ordeal. Anyhow, just watch out for this kind of thing. I know it seems silly to trip about $2, but it is the way the situation was handled that can make any meal turn sour. Luckily, there is a Tacos El Gordo in San Diego.
OMG, I'm definitely coming back to this place! So many choices of meats to choose from. The flavors of the different meats are soooo good too. I polished off 6 tacos and I'm loving every bit of it! The only issue I have is....... They don't serve beer.
$2 for tacos (except lengua which is $2.25) pretty standard pricing for better-quality tacos throughout the west, and these are good ones. Considering strip inflation right in this area the pricing is really pretty good espc. considering how good the food is. . . Ordering is a bit grabastic at first until you see how the system works. There's like 5 or 6 different grill stations that each specialize in certain meats, with a sign up over each indicating which are which. You go to the ones you want and order the items you want. You can combine orders at one station too if they're neighbors with the other meat you want. Then once you get the food you take it to one of the registers and they ring you up.
Two white girls walk into a taco bar.... . Okay, so I'm not white, but pretty darn close, especially when I walk into a place like this. I've never wanted to know how to speak Spanish so badly in my life...yet my bilingual skills are no bueno. . . So anyways, how did we end up here for lunch with our four kids? I'll tell you how. I walked by this place multiple times, to and from our hotel. I stopped one night and looked at the menu. I was tempted to go inside and order, but I didn't. Anytime of day that I walked by there, there was always people there. It could be 11AM or 11PM, always a line. That's another good indicator of good food. . . Finally, on our last day in Vegas, we decided to eat at this spot. Looking at the menu, I had decided that I wanted the al pastor tacos, my friend went with it and wanted the same. The kids got quesadillas and french fries. While trying to figure out what I wanted to eat, I realized that you have to stand in the the right line for the type of meat you want. I was able to order the quesadillas and french fries with the guy once I got there. . . It's pretty good food, I enjoyed the tacos I had. My kids were satisfied with their food too. I mean, you can't really complain, $30 for six people's lunches...one of the better deals on the strip. I'd visit here again, these tacos sure beat Jack In the Box tacos after you've partied a little too hard, haha.
The tacos are amazing but definitely not worth the HOUR plus wait just to order the tacos.   The ordering process is the most chaotic,  crazy thing I've ever seen. They have 3 lines for different meats.   If you want a carne asada taco and an adobado,  you have to go to two different LONG lines!   It's ridiculous.   Mind you,  this was a Tuesday night!  I do have to give credit for the tacos.   They were really good.   Would I eat there again?   I would like to  but I won't just because the ordering process and lines were just to out of control.
Definitely not worth the wait, I'm not sure if anyone writing reviews has ever had a truly great taco before. There was nothing special about the meat, tortillas, or salsa. We tried the asada and pork, both were not even average. Go to any taco truck in LA and it will be faster and better than this joint! Highly disappointed and would never recommend.
I love tacos and fries, and this place knows how to do tacos and fries. My favorite meat is the marinated pork adobada (which I still can't pronounce), and I get that with everything. Their portions are ginormous, esp with their fries; guacamole, cheese, sour cream, pork adobada, mhmmm. It's all there. Their tacos are crafted to perfection and omg, I crave the tacos from this place 24/7. T_T. . This place is also extremely busy at night, and I'm not fond of their ordering system at all. There are lines for different types of meats, and that prevents me from trying other meats. Regardless, I'm still satisfied coming here just for the pork adobada fries and tacos!
