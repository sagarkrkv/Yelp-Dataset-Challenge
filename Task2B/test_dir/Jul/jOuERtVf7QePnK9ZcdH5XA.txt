Apparently, not everything in Vegas has to be overpriced and hyped out because the Grand Lux Cafe completely made me swoon!. . I never got the chance to eat in because I'm running around Vegas without that much time on my hands but there's a friendly, nice little take-out cafe right next to the entrance of the Grand Lux that I frequented!. . Surprisingly, you can get a relatively good sandwich for $7 in this cafe. It is pre-made but none would be the wiser once you put it on a plate and ditched the wrapper. My gosh! I can't believe that I just got away with paying $7 for a sandwich in Vegas and it tastes relatively good?!. . Also, the service here is not shabby at all. The girls that always help me are super nice and they take the time to make exceptions for me if needed and handle drunk people all night! I can't believe I didn't find this place in the Venetian sooner!
The Grand Lux Margarita is a really excellent drink, one of the best margaritas I've ever had.. . The Grilled Steak Sandwich is tender and flavorful, on a perfectly toasted roll.  I had the salad with mine (rather than fries) and it was fresh, varied, and the dressing was a light and tasty vinaigrette.. . The complimentary bread is a light sourdough with a wonderful, crisp crust.. . In general the prices here are extremely modest considering the fact that it's in Las Vegas.  Husband and I ate lunch here for around $50, and that included my cocktail.
This place is great! The food and prices are really good and the service is incredible. The menu is huge and everything we tasted was delicious. The breakfast buffet is also very good. Don't be scared of the long line because service is very fast, so the wait is short.
Went in for lunch on a Monday as we were headed to the airport.  We got in with no wait, and they were able to get us our lunch quickly since we were in a hurry.  They accidentally brought us the wrong sandwich, but they rectified it within 2 minutes.  It was the best and fastest service we had in Vegas.. . Got the turkey club and a strawberry shortcake.  The sandwich was delicious, but the strawberry shortcake was amazing.  Best shortcake I have ever had - combined with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and fresh strawberries.  We will definitely be going back for another dessert.
Love, love, love this place!!  Their food is always delicious. I've never had a bad meal here. Casual dining and comfortable seating.  They have a very large menu with lots of options. You won't be disappointed!
Great food! Our service was excellent from Pierre. It's quite reasonable for Vegas, but still high for the real world.
We found the grand lux cafe a few years ago and are really glad we did. Although it tends to be constantly crowded, and are many, many seats so the wait time is fairly low. The people that work there very friendly and helpful, but I believe they might have to many tables to wait on per waiter/waitress, so if you need something, you may have to be a little patient. . Out of the four times we visited the grand Lux during the 1st week of May, 2014, the one meal that stood out above all the others, although the rest of them were all very good, was the French toast. Yup, the French toast. :-). It's about 2 inches high and tastes like you're eating a custard dessert. The secret is they soak the bread overnight in the sauce, and then fry it to perfection the next morning.. The menu is very versatile and there is something for every taste. Hence the reason we keep going back there. Quality is always very, very good. And the serving sizes are also quite substantial. . I made a comment to our waitress when she suggested splitting my husbands hash-browns because there were none available at the buffet, that the serving size my husband got with his breakfast wasn't big enough to split. She came out a few minutes later with a plate loaded with hash browns. How can you beat that service :-)
My friends and I ate here before heading out to Tao Nightclub. We got to Grand Lux Cafe around 9:30PM and were seated within 5-10 minutes. The decision to eat here turned out to be a really great since portions were perfect for the price.. . My sister and I shared the Pasta Telephono and it turned out be enough to fill the both of us up. The chicken to pasta ratio was good and I loved the creamy sauce. $14.95 for two people? Good deal to me! . . Reading reviews that Grand Lux is the sister company of Cheesecake Factory had me mentally comparing the two. I personally like Cheesecake Factory and found Grand Lux to be great in comparison. I'd highly recommend this place!
Wow What a Waffle!! This waffle was light, airy, deliciousness!  THE BEST... just amazed at the fluffy crisp texture.  Next time chicken and waffles.  Beautiful restaurant, service is slow but food makes up for the wait, really good coffee too.
3.5 stars, but they get 4 from me since the grilled chicken was super juicy!. . My friends and I came here around 9:30pm to grab dinner before clubbing. It took about 10 minutes to be seated, which wasn't bad considering it was extremely packed. It took awhile for our food to arrive, so this may not be the place to dine if you are in a hurry to get somewhere.. . We saw how large the portions were, so my friend and I shared the Pasta with Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella. The grilled chicken wasn't dry at all. I was surprised at how juicy it was considering it was white meat! I couldn't finish even though we shared. Definitely kept me full the rest of the night.. . Yelp reviews said this was the sister restaurant of The Cheesecake Factory, so we kept comparing the two. I think I like this one better! We saw the next table's Shrimp Scampi and that looked absolutely delicious! Dine here if you want good quality and portions for the price!
The only delicious affordable casual choice we located on the Strip. Bonus! It is open 24/7!!!. . We had some delicious soup sandwiches and salad here for lunch. I was impressed with the food quality. The atmosphere was nice - like a Cheesecake Factory. It is a great place to eat when you want something really delicious and don't feel like dressing up. We tried out several of the other cafe type places at Aria and Mandalay Bay and this was the nicest, most affordable and had the best food of the bunch. . . We also came back another time for desert. I had the creme brulee which was two deserts in one- chocolate creme brulee and the traditional type. It was delish and would be a great desert for two. My sweetheart had Godiva cheesecake and proclaimed it as good as Cheesecake Factory... Minus the Godiva truffle they decorate theirs with. . . The rars will be back.
They were very busy for breakfast and had trouble with their time management. My husband's Eggs Benedict was delivered by the manager without the ham... Waiter never checked on us... I had the baja omelet. It was a good choice.
We really liked this place! We got seated right away (it was around 5:30 pm on July 5th) and the staff was really nice to us. . . I ordered the Sicilian pasta and my boyfriend ordered the chicken pot pie - each were around 14-15 dollars (if I remember correctly). We realllllly enjoyed both dishes - and somehow we were too full to finish, but we tried our best. The portions were quite big. What I liked about it was how the atmosphere was nice and classy, but the dining style was pretty casual and the food felt homey - with portions that were bigger than we expected! . . I would come here again :)
Solid 3.5 stars, how can anyone not have a good time here, it's good for casual and good enough for higher-end too.. . Another good place for late night munchies, a bit gloomy for my tastes, made me sleepy.. . Ordered their famous carbonera, and while it's good, I've had better.  Overall, good value for the experience.. . Located in the back, across from the washrooms which is convenient.
**4.5 stars**. . Chicken and Waffles. . Never fails.. . 4.5 stars because I ate here twice when I was in town.. . 1st time was great! . Late night snack after the club. So drunk, so hungry, so satisfied.. Server, he was quick, cool, and attentive.. . 2nd time was for breakfast.... Took the server almost 10 min to greet us.. She wasn't attentive at all, to us anyway. I could see her at the other tables quite often.. She talked my husband out of getting the french toast because she said the texture is wet?!. Food was great, as usual.
Ordered the chicken and waffles.  SO GOOD! the syrup was different as it is half syrup half melted butter.  And the waffle was a perfect fluff that would disappear in my mouth, very cotton candy like.  The chicken strips were under seasoned, like no salt at all, so I just dumped it in ketchup and that was perfection.
This is a lovely go - to for good food. Great quality and big portions! Owned by the Cheesecake Factory, you can also order desserts with your meal.. . My husband and I always go there whenever we're in Vegas. Other times I've taken my family, and we've also met up here with friends whenever we do Vegas trips.. . Our last time there was a great experience. I forgot our server, but he was very friendly and checked up on us regularly.. . For food: . I had their Cobb salad, and my husband had a burger/fries (the fries were delicious) and the presentation for both were great. My Cobb was HUGE! I couldn't finish it. :) . . As for drinks:. .  My Pina Colada was also creamy and delicious and my husband's beer tasted fresh.. . Never disappoints!!!! Will always be back for late night eats!
For a 24/7 casino cafe, the food was very good and service equally good.  Although I'm sure there is no Kobe beef in my meatballs, the Kobe meatballs were yummy paired with the marinara sauce.  The best dish was the ribeye my husband ordered.  It was tender and flavorful--so much better than some real steakhouses.  And the bread they serve comes warm.
Every time I come to Vegas I eat here like twice a day. The southwest salad is so good and the slice of cheesecake is bigger than my foot. Mmmmz
Really enjoy the Protein breakfast.  Staff is both friendly and attentive.  Service was quick and I was on my way.  No pressure to finish and leave.  Never been disappointed in all my visits.  Will definitely go back again.  Prices are reasonable.  Good for families too!
As other reviews has stated, this place bears a strong resemblance to the Cheesecake Factory. The restaurant itself is quite large, so even during the dinner rush we were seated within 5mins of putting our names down. Once we were seated, we spent  a good 10mins going through the pages and pages of the menu. Luckily, they served warm bread & butter to munch on while deciding on what to eat. . . We all ended up choosing a 'medium plates', which was actually still too big for any of us to finish. My housemade pierogies were so delicious! Light, fluffy potato dumplings served on top of braised short ribs & mushrooms.. mmm. I also tried a bit of the kobe (softball-sized) meatballs in the creamy cheesy polenta which were also great. Our appetizer of wings were also moist inside with a nice crunchy exterior. Yum! Considering how much food they give, the prices are definitely reasonable and they are open 24/7, which is perfect for everyone in Vegas!
The best waffles in the world, even better than the ones from Belgium.   And, I have spent 2 weeks in Belgium on a business trip.  The waiters and waitresses go the extra mile, wow!
If you just got back from clubbing and are staying at the Venetian, this is the place to visit. I actually found this place on Yelp, go figure. We had spent all night gambling and decided to stop here before we got a snooze snooze in. For a 24 hour restaurant, the food here is superbly cooked and even at 3am in the morning, the staff are quite friendly. I got the Cuban sandwich which was cooked perfectly, with the cheese and ham sunk into the bread in a delicious amalgamation.
