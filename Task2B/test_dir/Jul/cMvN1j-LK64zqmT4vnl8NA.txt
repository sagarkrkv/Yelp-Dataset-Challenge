Poor service (had to request refill on chips from multiple employees). Food is mediocre and overpriced. The kicker for our experience was the giant foot-long hair in our $65 margarita pitcher.
Overall disappointed. The portion sizes were terrible for the price and the bartender (since we sat at the bar) failed to tell us thatthe dish we ordered and appetizer would not be enough for a lunch for two. We ordered the pigs on horseback due to its hype. They were definitely the best thing we had though they were on the dry side and lacked something I think a crisp vinegar style dipping sauce could have easily fixed. We also ordered the Beijing Glass noodles which promised to be a light vegetarian dish to compliment our heavy pork break appetizer. The noodles came out and the whole dish was a little larger than my fist. More of a side really. It seemed like they had marinated everything in sesame oil and had little other flavor. Since we were still hungry we ordered a couple of tacos thinking the other side of the menu would be good. Wrong. The Tinga Poblano was really flavorless and the cochinita was even worse. The pork had a bland dipped-in-A1 taste and the onions didn't add anything to the dish other than filler that distracted me from the taco. The service was terrible. Our bartender was attentive to our waters but failed to help us decide anything and generally acted aloof and a bit shady. The decor was enjoyable and the idea I think is awesome. I really hope they step their game up. Probably the worst restaurant to eat at in the cosmo. I will not be returning.
I LOVE LOVE LOVE China Poblano!! The (Mexican) menu is similar to Oyamel in DC and every bit as delicious..add some amazing Chinese food. The ceviche is my absolute favorite!! Nothing compares--the crispy texture of the amaranth with the soft, fresh fish is a force to be reckoned with. I love the cocktails--Lychee is the best one!! The pork tacos are amazing. The Kao Lao Lao noodles, with dragon sauce, are my favorite item on the menu...aside from the ceviche. The service never disappoints. The servers know and love the menu. I absolutely love China Poblano and I will continue to make a stop on every visit to Vegas!
This place sux... Chinese mexican is a great concept but.... Portions are ridiculously small for the price.  Dont come here hungry for sure.  Need to order like 3-4 plates per person.  @ average of $18 per plate will get expensive for Chinese / Mexican food.  Not worth it at all!!!
Are you looking for authentic Chinese and/or Mexican food? Do you enjoy unique fusion combos? Is it important for you to get good value in terms of quality/quantity vs price? If you answered yes to any of these questions, do not bother eating at this place.. . The decor and service are top notch, I will give them that. But a restaurant is about food first and foremost, and those things should be there to complement the experience, not make up for bad food. I had the Golden Pigs, the Lamb Pot Stickers, the Har Gau, and the Swallow a Cloud. The portions were ridiculously tiny: I could've fit all six pieces of Har Gau in one bite. The noodle soup was really bland. . . Everything about the restaurant looks unique, fancy, and pricy: all usually good indications. But not here. Here, "unique, fancy, and pricy" are the indications of pretentiousness. Don't be drawn in.
A friend who lives in Vegas recommended this place and it did not disappoint.  One of the best tacos I have ever had and the braised pork sandwich, although small, was amazing.
Service is good, drinks are good. . Food is terrible. I can even cook better than this.
0 stars if I could have given! . I will never be back here again! . I do understand it is Las Vegas, but go easy on your prices and portions -whoever is in charge of pricing! . . $6 for ONE small taco! . And I ordered soy sauce, the server DID not tell me I'm being charged for it! Please take a guess how much he brought me: . . Go ahead...I'll wait. . . ....he brought about a table spoon of soy sauce (no joke); n charged us $3!!!!! WTF- GTFO for those of you who know what that stands for.  . . I had to double check again that this was a Chinese Resturaunt; and I don't know where  y'all are from; but even in the getto soy sauce is FREE! Ok? It's f***ing free.... . . . Anyways, again I asked for a chilly sauce; charged again . . Real bummer when I checked my statement, I was charged an extra $6, for the heck of it. . I called in and spoke to the manager, he confirmed it. I was in fact charged an extra $6 for the heck of it; but it would take 72 hours for that to go back to my account! WTF again!!! . That sucks! Good thing I called man. I mean just why? Change your system before people freak out, I already freaked out enough about your service! . The manager was nice tho on the phone. But I'm still keeping my 1 star; and if I could give 0, I still would. No management could ever change that!
If this were the price of a normal restaurant, it would deserve 2 stars.. . But this restaurant having Jose Andres' name tagged onto it....... you  expect more.  MUCH more.. . Unfortunately, things were not good.  The fries with XO sauce cost about $10... and it was way too salty to even eat.  And I have a salty palate.. . Soups were all salty, but lacking an flavor at the same time.. . Carnitas taco (single, 1 taco) was $5.50... and it was..... not even as good as a carnitas taco you can get at any taco stand for $1.50.. . Scallop siu mai was really good, the only thing I considered "good" from the meal.. . Disappointed for a "Jose Andres" restaurant.
Was a little drunk hungry, so this should have been set up as a great experience - but we just ended up disappointed. Everything was really expensive and the portions were small. Very tasty, yes, but a rip off on cost. I've eaten at a few of Andres' restaurants, and had some amazing meals, so I'm not sure what didn't click here this time. I know he commands some higher prices, but I just didn't feel like I was getting a good value. . . On a side note, the pop culture worship of famine-era Mao on the wall juxtaposed with the $50 a person dinner struck me as a little insensitive, but then again enough time has passed since the Cultural Revolution, so, what are you gonna do?
Chinese + Mexican? Does that even make sense? It did for me. To be fair, I came just for a snack between meals, so the small portions were not a problem. It is pricey for the portion sizes. . But all of the items I had were very good. Mushroom tacos, great. Not sure what the sauce was (soy+?) but was tasty. "Twenty vegetable" fried rice was one of the best examples I had.. The sticky rice desert was non-traditional but excellent.
I expected the prices of the entrees to be a little bit higher but the quality of the Chinese food was not worth the money I paid for the dishes. I got the 18 monk noodle and the traditional dimsum. If I could describe the food  in one word-terrible! Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.
One of my favorite places at Cosmo.  I usually sit at the bar and have the bartender just pick dishes for me.  Everything is pretty solid  I recommend sharing with friends and ordering a variety of things
If I could give this place 0 stars I would! The only reason it deserves a 1 is becausetheir Micheladas were pretty decent. . . Where do I start? The prices, portions, excessive use of salt and sugar? To start off I ordered chips and salsa. When the chips and salsa arrived I was excited to try the salsa since it looked dark and spicy (I'm Mexican and this resembled the salsa I make at home). WRONG!!!!! This salsa tasted so sweet it was such a disappointment. For my main entree I ordered two tacos one of which was the carnitas and the other was chicken. The carnitas was excessively greasy and the chicken taco was again very sweet. My fiance ordered the shrimp poblano which was again extremely sweet. I understand not all Mexican food is made the same but the food at this particular restaurant tasted very foreign to me. . . Not to mention they played a lot of bachata music which is not Mexican at all!! However, since there were tons of white people dining here they wouldn't know the difference. . . In conclusion, I was very disappointed with my meal and since the prices are not fair for the quality of the food I will not be coming back to this restaurant nor will I recommend this place to my family or friends!
Spent our 24th anniversary at China Poblano and we were so, so satisfied.  But be warned this is a trendy "small plate" big price restaurant which means both your wallet and your stomach could be left empty. However, the food is delicious, the atmosphere fun and the service impeccable, if a bit pretentious (each food runner describes the dish you just ordered as they deliver it to your table in case you are so drunk on their incredible tequila offerings that you need reminding). . . China Poblano offers both Mexican and Chinese dishes side by side, hence the name.  I was hoping for more of a fusion concept but dove in with all tastebuds firing. . . Number one: Getthe carnitas taco.  At $5.50 it is moist, flavorful and meaty!  Yes there should be at least 2 if not 3 tacos for that price but trust me, ignore the price and just order a lot of these! . . The guacamole and warm tortillas are delicious and filling.  The quail egg shumai are great and you get 6 of them in one order.  The pozole is good and satisfying, not the best I've had but good.  The dan dan noodles were earthy tasting and not my favorite although the actual noodles were wonderful, the topping tasted of pungent, ground earth, maybe not bad, but not my taste.. . For dessert, we ordered the churros with Oaxacan chocolate.  This was off.  The churros were flavorless and not sweet enough although the texture was right.  The chocolate was bad.  The flavor was mingled with an unrecognizable savory, spice that we didn't care for at all.  . . Had a fabulous 1.5 oz. pour of tequila.  Their tequila menu is extensive and organized by Highland and Lowland brands.  Also their take on the classic margarita is really fun with a salty foam topping that is delicious for those who enjoy a salted margarita.  . . The prices are ridiculous which is why I am not giving the place 5 stars. But it's the new Vegas and long gone are the crappy $1.99 buffets about which I am certainly not complaining.  However, it seems we've moved to the opposite end of the spectrum, serving higher quality food while gouging people with prices 4 times the actual cost of the ingredients.  I hope in my lifetime, we see a happy balance between the two.. . But if you're willing to blithely open your pocketbook, you're in for a great meal!
Ummmm totally not worth it!. . We wanted to try a different restaurant at our last stay in Vegas. We were originally going to eat Wicked Spoon but the line was long and last call was in 45 minutes. We knew we weren't going to have enough time to eat. . . Thankfully, it was only lunch so we weren't TOO HUNGRY so we decided to switch it up and try China Poblano. I first noticed it was owned by chef Jose Andres. I had a bad experience with Chef Andres and truthfully, didn't enjoy his restaurant over in LA at the Bazaar. So I decided to give him another try.. . It was pretty empty upon walking in. We were seated promptly and service was fast. First off, we decided to order some soda because we were thirsty and the waitress comes out with these dinky small soda cans!!! Those sodas were $5!!! We orders some ceviche, tacos, dan dan mien, and chilaquiles. My overall favorite was their ceviche. Decent flavor with a good amount of tuna. Nothing spectacular though. Different cuisines are prepared in different kitchens so food comes out at off times. Their noodles were okay. A good kick of spice but obviously not traditional. The chilaquiles was a joke. Basically tortilla chips with sauce on top. Looked like a cheap mans version of nachos. Can't believe we paid $15 for it. Everything's on the lighter smaller side so be prepared to either eat light or order a lot!. . After lunch, that was it. Again, nothing too spectacular. Food is expensive and small. It's much more worth it to spend your money somewhere else. Not missing out if you haven't tried this place at Cosmo.
Feel like Mexican food? Or Chinese? Or both? Check.
This place is great! I ordered the Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich and the reposado flight of tequila and was very impressed.  The sandwich was an Asian flairof a BBQ sandwich and the tequila came with 2 great reposado's and an equally great mezcal and a palate cleansing drink to sip on.   This place is great!
This place is awesome! Great mix between Asian & Mexican!. . When you first walk in it has a great cushion decor & feel. It's neat just to look around at the various decorations.. . We tried a flight of tequilas & their margarita- both were delicious! Super recommend their Salt Air Margarita!. . My hubby had the Rou Jai Mo Street Sandwich & it was DELICIOUS!. . I had the carnitas & cochinita tacos both were super delicious! We shared the chips & salsa & those were yummy too.. . Service was great also! Our waitress was nice & prompt! We highly recommend this place. It's 100000 time better than the gross buffet!
The guacamole was perfect, the spiciest had a good kick, and the sprinkling of queso fresco (or a similar cheese maybe?) was a nice touch. The tinga taco was tasty, and I really enjoyed the traditional shumai plate, a great sampler of the different varieties.  I had bites of my friends plates, and their food ranged from meh to pretty good.  However, I was expecting a unique and exciting experience from a Jose Andres restaurant, and was very underwhelmed by the experience in general.  This was definitely a one-time visit for me.
NOT WORTH THE MONEY!! . . We have no problem spending good money on food but this place was not worth it at all. It's disappointing because I think all the restaurants at Cosmo offer great food (even secret pizza) but this place is a disaster. Service is slow and food is barely average at best. Save yourself $150 for two people and eat somewhere appetizing.
