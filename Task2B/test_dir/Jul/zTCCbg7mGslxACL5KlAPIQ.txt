Since my hubs and BIL haven't been to Vegas or a Vegas buffet, I originally wanted to take them to the best buffet, but decided on this one because the cost was not the cheapest or the most expensive. Overall, I would have to say it was 'a-ok.' The quality of the meat station was impressive, but some of the other stations lacked variety. I was saddened by the Asian cuisine section because they only offered Chinese food...that really wasn't impressive. They did offer seafood, which is always a plus, a station where they make fresh pasta and a gelato bar. I probably wouldn't come here again, unless I got a free meal. . This buffet was a bit hard to find for us, since we had never been here before. But if you decided to come, make sure you go up to the second floor. It could be in the middle of the casino, there is an escalator that takes you up or from a front end, where a clothing shop is located.
More like 3.5, but couldn't bring myself to a 4 due to the lack of dessert.. . Came here at 3:15pm for dinner food at the lunch price because that's how I fly.. . PROS:. +Better quality prime rib than most buffets that advertise "Prime Rib". . . +Pretty good King Crab (not the twice frozen junk at Bellagio where you are biting into a king crab popsicle). . +Fresh salmon nigiri (rice under it was cold and hard so I had no problem turning it into sashimi). . +Excellent coffee. . +Good service. . CONS: . -Some items they just didn't rotate out. Not that I'd eat pizza at a "higher-end" buffet but having the same pizza with the cold hard cheese sitting there for almost 2 hours didn't present well (The pizza at Bachannal buffet is REALLY good, however).. . -Desserts. . From the small selection that they had, it seemed like anything that looked good was made in a way to appeal to a small amount of people. Either "Gluten Free" or "Sugar Free"...but I just want it to taste good...that's why I came here in the first place...don't need sweetener substitutes that make this thing less than it could be. . . Also, I'm tired of buffets putting out cupcakes to fill an entire area of the desert section ( I'm looking at you, Planet Hollywood!). I love cupcakes, but if you've ever had a buffet cupcake, you'll know it wasn't made that day or even the day before. It's not moist and it's just a mistake to put on your plate. Well, the whole top row here was cupcakes. . . The ice cream "wheel of flavors" didn't come near to the quality they have at Bachannal which is really top notch...another dessert disappointment. . . On the other hand the croissants were good as were the macaroons.. . Overall I'd come back and pay $23 (lunch) for dinner food. Prime rib and king crab, you can't go wrong.
The buffet was good, but not GREAT. I would give it 3.5 if that were possible, because I was satisfied, it's just not something I'm going to be craving. The food was good for the most part and everything was cooked well. I tried a little bit from each section. But I felt that everything was pretty basic and not much really stood out for me. My favorite thing I would say was the salmon. It had this really delicious pineapple/mango salsa on top that was sweet and went very nicely together. . . The dinner buffet was about $45 per person (4th of July weekend). It's on the strip, so I wouldn't expect much less, but still, just wouldn't go too often.
For $45 not necessary worth the price unless you are a PIG that likes average to below average food.  The additional $12.99 for the unlimited drinks for (2 hours) is well worth it...probably more than the food itself.  Treat it like a bottomless bar with all the food you can eat for 2 hours.
For only $20 for breakfast, this buffet is actually pretty good.. . Good food and good selection. Of course since it's breakfast, there won't be as much selection as the dinner menu so that is understandable. For the price, you can't beat it. Everything tasted pretty good from the savory foods to the dessert. Nothing really stood out, but I think you get your moneys worth.. . The customer service was friendly and nice.. . The environment was modern looking, a bit plain, but not bad.. . I would want to come back and try the dinner menu. Hopefully it will be just as good if not better than their breakfast menu =]
Went here for a Monday lunch buffet. The boyfriend  and I are loyal myVegas players so we got the 2 for 1 deal. Paid $25 for 2 people. . . The food was just okay, not great. Definitely not something I would crave or even consider coming back (unless it's free). . . +1 for having crab legs on a weekday lunch . . -1 for slow service. . -1 for RUDE ice cream lady named MARIA. Accused me of leaving dirty plates by her desserts when I was just standing there looking at the ice cream choices. Even after I told her those weren't mine, she continues to accuse me and said she saw me put it there.
Ask the hostess to be seated in Alicia's section -- she will bring out the Sierra Nevadas faster than you can drink them. And she'll make your dirty plates disappear before you even knowit. . . Get some shellfish, some Maytag blue cheese, a little dim sum, tiramisu.... and you're good to go!   . . Thanks, Aria!  Thanks, Alicia! Can't wait to go back!
This was probably one of my favorite buffets in Vegas. The variety was large and the food was actually pretty yummy. You have a lot of different genres of food, Asian, sea food, Mediterranean, Latino, American and steaks. The dessert area had gelato looking ice cream, a little more ice cream texture. They also had pastries and cheesecakes. . . The kids ate everything and I left satisfied and full. Oh I can't forget this part - bottomless BEER, mimosas and Bloody Mary's for $12.99 so so so WORTH IT.
"Tip the waitstaff!! Way overated!!!". . . . Desserts were good..but the Mexican,Italian and seafood sections were sub-par.Pizza was far from fresh.Prime rib was decent. Was hoping it would be as good as the Wynn or the Bellagio..not even close,sorry. Better than {Circus-Circus though} Our waitress {Debbie} worked hard ,a large table of Chinese visitors {6 adults,4 children}had her running as they consumed miles of Crab legs and needed dishes cleared as the waved her away when she asked if she could get them anything else.,then spent an hour on their cell phones..I noticed they left NO tip..nothing..SHAMEFUL!! She said its ok when I asked her if they left her anything..said she was just happy to have her job! We tipped her well...Tip your servers..Geez!!!!!
Great buffet with TONS of options. You want noodles for breakfast? What about oysters on the half shell? Pizza? You got it! . . Pretty clean, great selection, good service, short lines.... . . I wish I could say more... It's just a really solid buffet!
Amazing for breakfast.. . I can eat their biscuits n gravy all day any day.
We went to go see a show at Aria & stopped here for dinner. . . Overall I was really pleased with this buffet - loved the variety and the fresh made naan! The desert bar was ok, but the made up for it almost everywhere else!. . Service was great - helpful & quick to clear our table without being obnoxious .
I can't usually do a buffet justice but I went back four times for more food. It had some of the best variety I've ever seen. There was sushi, endless shrimp and crab legs, muscles, clams, crawfish, oysters...all delicious. There was an olive, meat, and cheese area. Thought I died and went to heaven. I was able to try out some Mediteranian food which I'd never had before. The list goes on and on.. . Our waitress was quick to replenish drinks and wisk away dirty plates. She was also very good natured which can make or break any dining experience.. . The dessert portion was meh but I'm not a huge dessert person. . . We had a 2 for 1 coupon which helped keep costs down. We ended up paying just under $20 each. It is a costly buffet but well worth it. I'm dreaming about the day we can go back.
Aria what happened? You were our favorite.  Never again.  There was not one thing to put in my mouth and smile about.. .....  Just average.  And below average   Shame on you
I haven't tried enough buffets in Vegas to give this place 5 stars, but I suspect it might be worth it. We came here because it was a package deal with Zarkana tickets, but if you're looking for a buffet that's worth the price I feel like Aria's is good. My only real Vegas comparison is the buffet at the Wynn, which comes highly recommended by others, but I thought this one was much better.
came here this weekend after they had renovated and it has only gotten better since last time we came here.  This is buy far the best buffet on the strip.  We were here 2.5 hrs eating alof of good crab all kinds  and other seafood as well as meats and many other things especally deserts, they had my jusbands two favorite gelatos, orange shebert and mint and chip.  The food here never disappoints.  Will for sure be back here the next time we are in town and will have to try the brunch buffer here as well.
Crustacean scum 0 : me 1. . Just your typical buffet with most of the selection of food being old and nasty. Nothing special. I spent most of my time ripping apart crab exoskeleton while shocked bystanders stared at the barbaric sight.. . THEY CAN JUDGE ALL THEY WANT BUT I HAVENT HAD ME SOME CRAB IN A WHILE
Food was not great. Decent at best. What saved this review was the desert. Everything else did not taste well.. . Came here last year. It's as if the quality went down hill.
I'm not sure why or how we ended up at this buffet, but it was a total rip off! We went at 3pm and paid dinner prices. It came out to be around $50 per person including tip, which wouldve been fine if the food was amazing. Sadly, the selection was small and the food was average at best.. . I usually dive for the seafood and steak at buffets to get my money's worth, but the seafood and meats here were just mehhh. So meh that it wasn't even worth getting a second serving. I tried walking around and looking for something delicious, but everything looked (and tasted) like cheap buffet food. Sadly, my favorite food at the buffet was the tomato and mozzarella.  . . If you have 50 bucks to spend on food, do yourself a favor and spend it elsewhere!
So..we're in Vegas. Besides gambling, girls and sin---Vegas is known for its palace style buffets. We rolled the dice and decided to take a short walk from our New York New York hotel room and make an attempt to eat our monies worth at the Aria hotel buffet. The total came to over $50 for two people and we crapped out. . . Aria won as we did not find a buffet fit for a king or my queen. There was a variety of global flavors: Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian, Chinese and a pitiful spread labeled American. I have to admit, I'm a bit of a picky eater and typically stick with the simple things--pizza, burgers, chicken--you know, steak and potatoes kinda guy. The pizza was dry and there was only two slices left as I approached the Italian section. There were no burgers or burger making station, that would've been neat but maybe too big an ask. The fried chicken was the highlight as it was crunchy and had a nice flavor. As good as the chicken were the mashed potatoes, problem is--I had to hold up the line scraping the last bits of potatoes from the bottom of the pot. O well, at least I should be able to find a nicely charred stake to go with my tea spoon of potatoes. NOPE. There was no steak on the buffet. No steak, that's right folks, no steak on a $20 plus/per person buffet. I had to settle for honey glazed ham--another positive element--and under cooked roast beef. . . Hey, there was a great salad bar...O, no French dressing. Yes I know, I'm picky...why would I expect some odd request like French dressing. . . The dessert station was quite an impressive presentation. Too bad the taste didn't quite match the looks. . . If you like sea food, ignore everything you've read. There was plenty of seafood but I don't touch the stuff.
Even a bit disappointed given how nice this hotel is, but it is what it is.  Came here more out of convenience, didn't want to keep on looking, but at this point, wasn't aware of Wicked Spoon, but i digress.. . Another justifiable reason was there were no lineups at 5:30pm on a Monday, so easy breezin.. . Glad they had the crab legs, plump prime rib, and the mash potatoes, but that's about the best part.  There was congee and sushi, but didn't dare touch that.. . The desserts were a bit underwhelming, though the circular display of their gelato was probably the only highlight.  Oh, the creme flan was pretty darn good.. . Nice orange theme going around here, and liked the open concept here.. . But can't really rant and rave for someone to return here.. . $35/pp.
Was not happy how the cashier Martha, did not smile.  Did not Thank us. Instead I smiled at her as she handed us the receipts.  I told her Thank you.  She didn't acknowledge me.  We got our comps (BOGO) from myVEGAS slots. It's 8,000 loyalty points.  Hours of playing to EARN it. . .  Everyone on staff was miserable. The only guy that was happy to serve me was the guy at the carving station,  African American gentlemen. Can't remember his name.. . Waitress asked us what we wanted to drink.  Doesn't grab us silverware. I had to ask for it. She then says, "Oh! It's suppose to be set already".  She didn't refill our drinks.. . The food was okay at best.  They had "portuguese sausages", I asked the carver is it Chorizo or Linguica? He said to me,  "the first one". Lol. It was not as spicy as I expected. It was okay, edible. The only thing I liked was pleased with was the mash potatoes had garlic in them.  I ate the mash & tried everything.  It was all cold & old sitting out.  The chicken pot stickers were awfully bland.. . The desserts were pretty good but the Asian man serving gelato was a prick. He had something up his butt. He sees me waiting behind the girl he was serving.  I let her go since she was there before me,  I thought.  She left,  he doesn't acknowledge me.  But the family that walks up, he acknowledged them but they were just looking.. . Really upset how this experience went. I'm glad I didn't pay $50 but still.  I'm glad I tried it for half price.
I don't know why there're so many bad reviews for Aria buffet. We had a great time there! Yes, the price is around $35 which is slightly more than others but we think it's worthwhile considering the overall Experience. The waitress that we had was awesome! She was super attentive that makes the one we had from Planet Hollywood's looks really bad!! The food was great, the 1/2 lobster was delicious and no extra cost!
If you're a seafood lover, you may have a little bit of fun here but not for long--unless all you plan on eating is seafood such as crab legs and mussels. The variety of fish is not very impressive. There's no baked, broiled, or smoked fish. The salad bar is very sad. As far as fresh vegetables go, your salad choices are greens and tomatoes, and then the rest of the salad bar is just composed of candied fruits. I was expecting to see chopped cucumbers and sprouts and you know, a real salad bar with actual variety! Not everyone wants to fill up on only heavy dishes. Fresh salads would have been nice.. . The seafood that they do have is delicious and the bean salads that they have are nice, but after serving two small plates of cold seafood, I felt bored and unsatisfied. I walked around the buffet a few times but nothing stoodout to me. The variety of foods just does not look appealing. I left the buffet hungry. You know something is wrong when you leave a buffet hungry. For the expensive price tag, I would not return.
Good variety of food. Love the Mediterranean and the Indian selections (fresh Naan). Alaskan crab and shrimp is really fresh. My only caveat was that they don't do a good job replenishing the food when it's empty. The dessert station is worth checking out.
It was amazing!!!!!. My two kids loved it, it is the most talked about subject since we came back from Vegas.. Totally worth the money.
Fantastic spread of food. We went there for the lunch buffet, got right in didn't wait more than 5 mins. Place was clean, the selection was great. Crab legs on the lunch buffet and they were really good too. Sushi, prime rib, Asian, Mexican and more. And the quality of the food was really good. . . Highly recommend eating here.
This was my first Vegas Buffet, so yes, I'm a little biased. . . It fulfilled all of my wildest dreams. . . The sushi is ok, nothing insane. . The curries were ok. . . I was really impressed with their salads, the uniqueness of them, and how good they tasted. . I loved that they had dumplings and dim sum. . The lasagna was awesome. . The mini sandwiches were gorgeous plus yummy. . Naan was delicious. . The build your own taco area was amazing, and the brisket was tender and flavorful as can be. . Paella was yummy. . . Those are just some highlights. I realize that this is my "first time", but the amount of food that was there plus the high quality and variety was really impressive. . . Also, I eat almost anything, so I've got a lot more options than picky eaters.
