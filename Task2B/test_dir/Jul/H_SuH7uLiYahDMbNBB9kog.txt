Never had anything like this or maybe have but when I say never is because I love it. The flavors are so good. I got the nachos & the chips are perfect. The flavor & fresh flavor. I want to try the fried rice & kimichi.
If you love Mexican food, you'll love it here, homemade chips, crisp withe salsa and guacamole great. Chimichanga huge. Pork belly Tacos good, offered with 4 different sauces to spice it up 2 Korean, 2 Mexican. Employees very friendly.
I've heard so much about Korean and Mexicanfusion so when I saw this restaurant on Yelp I had to try it out. They make the food as it's ordered so plan on spending some time here, especially if it's busy. It is worth the wait. I ordered the tostada with bulgogi meat. The meat was tender and the marinade was delicious. It reminded me of my mother's tapa- Filipino- except that it was sliced thinner. It was served on top of a rice patty, a patty with some crispy rice on the outside. Topped with cabbage and salsa this meal tasted so fresh. I can't wait to go back to try their other specialties!
A unique Korean twist on Mexican food with a Chinese fortune cookie at the end :P. . We had the fried wontons(can't be beat at 5 for $1.50!!), spam masubi with fried egg(comes with 2 masubis), the bulgogi burrito, and bulgogi plate. Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly and only cost $25 for everything!! We even had leftovers! . . Free chips with guac and salsa(which is made daily in-house). That guac had to have been my favorite ever! And I eat a lot of guac.. . Location is not as convenient but hey, not everything in life is going to be right around the corner from me :). . Definitely will be back and definitely recommend it to all my fellow Yelpers!!
Definitely NOT four and a half stars!!. We ordered bulgogi burrito-- it was only okay at best... Not enough meat, too much rice. Bf felt the meat was over cooked as well. . We also ordered Korean wings-- I liked them, bf did not as much-- again he felt they were over cooked.  The fries which came with it were frozen fries cooked with no salt-- very little to recommend.. Don't think we'll be returning.
Just regular Mexican tacos with the usual meats replaced with Korean meats. . Beef Bulgogi Tacos with Kimchi. - dry bulgogi, kimchi had a weak flavor. . Pork Belly Tacos with Kimchi. - dry pork belly, I preferred the beef ones. . Pork Bulgogi Chimichanga. - topped with pico and the insides were like a regular burrito except with asian marinated meat, also dry. . I like where they were going with this idea, however I expected a little more fusion like places in SF or NYC (adding gochujang sauce or incorporating banchan).  This could easily be a 4 star if the food was a little more juicier.
Two words: Bulgogi Cheesesteak.. Two more words: The. Bomb.. . (See my previous review for other tasty options!)
On my first visit I had the Fusion Burrito and my sister had the Fusion Chimichanga (basically my burrito fried).  We were such fans we went another day during our weekend visit in Vegas and this time I tried the Fusion Flautas and she again got the Fusion Chimichanga.  . . My only regret is that I didn't order myself the Fusion Chimichanga to go.  I'll be going back for that next time I'm in town.  Huge fan of this spot!
I visited this place after hearing about it and seeing the yelp reviews. KOMEX definitely did not disappoint. I had the bugolgi tacos and combo fried rice.. AMAZE BALLS!!!! The location is a bit sketchy but the inside is better than the outside appearance. Will be back...
Very clever idea of combining both amazing dish. I got to say it hit the spot. I will come back to taste the whole menu since it's 5mins away from me... This is by far a hidden gem and I found it! Kudos to Yelp...
I ate at the Decatur and Washington Location on 7-23-2014.  It is hidden in a small strip mall and parking is at a premium.  The business was small but clean.  I arrived just before the place became busy. I was hoping to have a great eating experience, as the reviews I read, indicated others had enjoyed the food and service.  I ordered the (1/2 Order) of Bulgogi fries which was about $6.00 and a Diet Pepsi (which was bottled and cost $2.00)  The bulgogi fries tasted old and luke warm.  The meat, cheese and jalapenos were tasty but were also dry and by the time I finished them, were  cold and stuck together.  I was disappointed as I had driven quite a ways to eat there and it really wasn't worth the drive.  I ordered a burrito to go ($7.00) and it had it latter that day at home and it was only average.  I do not have the great experience that other reviewers seemed to have, nor did I find the food to be the "bomb" as  others rated the food to be.   The people running the place were friendly and I was happy with the service, but I came for the food and I will have to think if I want to go and try this place again.
Best kimchi friend rice in the world. Bulgogi tacos and calimari Taco were legit too. Only reason I ventured so far off the strip is because of all the amazing yelp reviews and I was not disappointed.
What a difference a year can make. I honestly created a Yelp account to rave about this place. It used to be amazing. However, the second location opened pretty recently, and it was a extremely disappointing the last time I had it.. . Being a frequent customer for the past year or so, I did not hesitate to buy $40 worth of food for the family. I always tell my friends about this place. Unfortunately, something happened here recently (maybe a new chef), and the quality decreased significantly. Here's the meal we had:. . Fusion Burrito: Soggy. Extremely soggy. It tasted like somebody drenched the greens inside with water and removed any semblance of rice and meat. I could barely eat half of it. This used to be a favorite of mine!. . Fusion Quesadilla (with spicy pork): Also disgusting! I don't know how you mess up spicy pork and cheese. I got this for my little niece, and she barely had two bites. I thought something was wrong with her, so I tried it too. Straight to the trash... How can a quesadilla have a weird aftertaste?. . Shrimp Taco: The shrimp was definitely old. The aged seafood smell spread strongly throughout the house.. . We had a few more things, and they were adequate I guess. The aforementioned items were the worst.. . I'm so, so disappointed. I'm tempted to leave one star, but I put two out ofrespect for what the restaurant once was. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but what I received was inexcusable.
My first visit here. We came because of Yelp and were very pleased.  They were right on with service and the food was amazing! We tried a few single items -- chicken taco as a lettuce wrap, chicken flauta with fusion guacamole, beef slider, shrimp fried rice, shrimp taco with fusion tartar sauce. Everything was wonderful and the server was so patient and helpful and friendly!  Plus their prices are so competitive.  Our meal came to $26, and we had leftovers.
Good food. I ordered the Fusion Chimichanga...it was bbbiigggg. Every menu item was a pretty good sized portion. For $8 I'd say it was definitely worth it. The meat was tender and flavorful. Only thing I would say is that they're food wasn't really that spicy, I wouldn't even call it mild for my taste, so make sure you get some siracha or add some if you want that extra heat. . . They had good service, and fast too considering we had a really really big group. They gave us complimentary chips, salsa, and guac. Good stuff.. . Next time I'm definitely going to try other stuff on the menu because everything looked and sounded good.
I did tacos which were cool.  Fusion fries not a big fan of. The tacodilla was good. And shrimp taco was outstanding. A little hole in the wall. Glad I tried though.
