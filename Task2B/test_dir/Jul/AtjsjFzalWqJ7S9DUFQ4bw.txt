I stayed in room #3717 from 6/27/2014 to 6/29/2014, and I checked out at around 1 pm on the 29th. Right after that, I have found out I lost an Hermes shopping bag in the room. Including a mug, a bracelet, twillies, a scarf, a part of sunglasses, and a horse charm (all brand new and well-wrapped) in my bag, they worth about $8000. Thus I called the Lost & Found Dept. of the hotel on 6/30/14 at 8 am, and they said they didn't get report from any housekeeper. I had to call the housekeeping manager, Lynn Motoyama, to report this case. After an hour, I called back Lynn, but she said the housekeeper threw them away as trash! I don't believe that a professional housekeeper could not recognize the differences between trash and wrapped luxuries. I personally cannot accept such a ridiculous excuse! . . The irresponsible and nonprofessional services on such a case has made my stay at this hotel a terrific nightmare and a regretful loss.
This hotel was great. The decor and service was awesome. I would definitely stay here again. It's centrally located, which makes it very convient. Our room was facing the strip and the view was amazing. We could see the water show at the Bellagio from our room. Get a top floor the water show is so much better looking down at than viewing it from the strip.
I absolutely love this place it was my second time hereand without doubt it is the most chic and beautiful hotel!  MY FAVE hotel!. From the entrance to the rooms it is just Outstanding! The decorations, seriously Cosmopolitan!  . Yes it is very expensive but totally worth it - even if you stay in the cheapest of the rooms.. This time i was lucky to stay in one of the balcony suits facing to the fountains and the eiffel tower and it was  so beautiful! . The room had 2 full bathrooms, kitchen fridge, oven and microwave, Wait!!!  it also had washer and dryer! Yes I have never seen that before and i loved it! . The service was so high class it was out of this world! The maids, the bell boys and the operators are  just amazing when taking care of the guests! . Really enjoyed my stay there! I will be back!
The worst hotel I have been as far as guest services (checking in). We got here few hours ago and they said that the room that we reserved is no longer available. The manager was extremity rude and they were not willing to give us a better room. We ended up paying more for a smaller room. I would never come back here to stay.
Ruined our anniversary.   Came here all the time and spent a lot of money here.  But now they are more interested in catering to the day club kids who don't pay to stay here.  Noise level is obnoxious!! They don't care. Hope the kids have the money to keep it floating.  Bad marketing to those who have money and want to gave. Want  a decent adult time without the boom box like the jack hammer out side your window.  Ugh.  Stay at the Wynn if you want class.
This is the worst experience I have ever had  checking in to a hotel!!!! We paid in full they charged us but because we showed up late checking in they sold our room away!!!! I will never ever come to this hotel again!!! I drove 5 1/2 hours for them to tell me there was nothing they can do!!!! I wish this had a -100 ... They told us we should have called to tell them we were going to be late!!!!!! Can you believe that ???????? What are we kids????? We reserved the room for 3 days it was paid for 3 days!! There is nothing in the hotel policy that states to call for being late, it only states to call in advance when canceling!!!! This is unacceptable, This hotel just wanted to make double the money! Terrible customer service, never again!
I love the Cosmo! It's the place to be! . . It's chic and stylish. They have restaurants you want to eat at and shows to see. Drinks to drink! That's my favorite thing!! I LOVE their award winning food and beverage department! Their drink creations are amazing. I've not stayed in a room but I've been in them and they are ah-maz-ing! No wonder they cost a pretty shiny penny. I love the details in the decor. I love that they have resturants that you want to go to and are worth going to. I love Cosmo's trendy ways..  . . Recently we saw Chelsea Handler. Well the tickets said she was playing in the 'whatever' theatre (I forget the name) so we are all over the place trying to find a place that doesn't exist. Only to find out it's the Chelsea theatre. so we take the long walk there, and we want to get drinks and the line is sooo long. Luckily we said forget it and there were more barsahead! Don't get sucked into the first bars you see! So we get drinks and we get stopped by an usher who directs us to the usher at the door, that usher directs us to another usher that was behind us and that usher directed us to the wrong seats! Which really wouldn't have mattered because the back of the theatre wasn't full but you know how people are. The theatre itself isn't that impressive for the Cosmo really the seats weren't terrible, I mean we did get pretty much the average priced tickets but they were ok. Not what I expected for the Cosmo. Anyway, glad you're in my city Cosmo!
This hotel/resort is the worst! It started with check in. They named several fees that were not told to me when I made the reservation. Then they had no record of me paying for the first night two months prior. Luckily I was able to pull up my bank account showing the cleared transaction. While staying in hotel my room was only cleaned once. I happened to walk in room while he was cleaning and noticed he only FLUFFED my sheets and did not change them. Then he left without replacing the dirty glasses. The next day house keeping did not show up until 4:30. I asked her to come back in 30 minutes because we were getting ready to leave for second time that day. Upon returning @ 7 pm, our room still had not been cleaned. The next compliant is about the pool which closes at 7 pm. There is no way to spend the day on the strip and still have enough time to relax at the pool. Other than the balcony view. This hotel has no special amenities worth the price! You really don't even use the balcony that much because you spend most ur time out the room anyway
This is one of the classiest casinos in Las Vegas. It is pretty upscale so you have to be able to afford to stay here. I have partied in a wrap around suite before and it provides one of the most stunning views on the strip. I love the restaurant selection here as well. I have eaten at multiple places here, but my favorite one has to be STK. Even if you're just dropping in to be a tourist to take a photo in one of the giant shoes on the floor, its a blast at this location. They also have some pretty cool lounges for cocktails. I also enjoy this place because it's not a place where you are going to find many kids or any ratchets. It's a higher class of patrons that hang here.
i don't know where to start. . . hotel - the worst hotel i ever been to in my vegas life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we got to cosmopolitan at 2:30pm we went to check in line. so crazy how we waited in line for 30 mins not because the line was very long but these agents just take to d*** long. now that we got to an open agent we told them our information to check. the agent said " unfortunately  your room has been given away to another customer." what hotel does that? i was so shocked and pretty piss to start my vacation as you don't have a room. who gives room away to other people that is already paid. what kind of idiot does that!?!?!? we drove 5 hours to hear that we don't have the room we booked. and a reminder it wasn't the cheapest room either! i understand if they give away smoking rooms away but jesus ... not only did they give us a smaller room the agent said oh well we are going to take off $200 dallors off on your room. well no s*** you are giving us a smaller room. isnt that given? so stupid. and after i started yelling at the agent and asking for the manager he leaves to get the manager and comes back by himself. what kind of manager leaves a angry customer and not come to handle the problem when the agent cant? horrible customer service. oh by the way cosmo your 100 dallor credit is a piece of ****. :) . . second, the rooms are dirty. very dirty. the bathroom is dirty. i rarely take showers with my flip flops on. the shower area, the floor is black and you can see soap scums everywhere. i dont think they bother to clean anything. sink had soap stain everywhere. the mirror and water marks everywhere. remind you ladies, they are no bathtub in the 2 bed suit rooms. the tissue box only had 2 tissues. strange you would think they would check to make sure a least there's half.. . . we called house keeping to get extra towels and pillow. that took exactly 2 hours and 27 mins... very nice.. . . we normally stay at aria and wynn. but i've heard that cosmo was pretty nice so we decided to stay but dang never will i stay there and i will make sure none of my friends and family will go there. . . also i understand people throw up places where they shouldnt be but its vegas, but aleast clean the throw up right away, why do workers stare at is and away and no body show up till later? great way to gamble and smell throw up. . . last, why dont cosmo just hire security guards or whatever to check that they are going to their rooms instead of making the key go in, in the elevator. REMINDER if you dont put the key in time the door will close and go on to whatever floor its going. You can not just press the room floor and be able to go out. its complicated and stupid. . . its not good. think twice before you stay here.
3 1/2 stars. Arrived on a Monday and checked in at the Autograph lounge which means shorter lines since I'm a Premier Platinum member for life via Marriott rewards.. . Unfortunately like other reward programs the reward program recent adjustments don't get their top 5% loyal customers much of anything now a days.  Profit driven corporations including the Marriott program which includes the Autograph Collection (The Cosmopolitan Of Las Vegas). Platinum members are offered 500 rewards points or a $10.00 credit towards food or beverages purchased during their stay. No longer offered are the complimentary brunches at Wicked Spoon, welcome gifts of adult libations or hors d'oeuvre. Upgrades on the rooms are honored IF available and during this stay the Electronic Daisy Carnival was in town so  these were non existent.  Even the valet check in and just getting around the hotel was a challenge - it was so overwhelmingly busy I opted to avoid dinning in house or hanging out due to the excess crowds and waiting. . . Another con was booking my stay here via the Marriott website which promoted three nights for the price of two & a deposit up front. The nightly fee of the room didn't include the resort fee or nightly tax which was not disclosed on the confirmation. The website doesn't disclose the nightly rate is the discounted rate per night up front and the third night was not deducted at checkout as usual.  In addition, all three resort fees and taxes were added. I thought this was deceiving and feel they impr disclosing this up front. . . As for the room all was good except with the bathroom hardware handle which continued to fall off when accessed to shut or open the sliding door. I had to call maintenance to repair it - which they did promptly. I alos didn't like the mattress here due to they were overly soft and mushy - result backache. . . Will I return here again? The jury is deliberating on this one still!
I'vestayed in the Cosmo twice now, and I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Las Vegas. It's impeccably clean, stylish, and sexy. The staff is beyond friendly and hospitable. Great restaurants (Blue Ribbon, The Henry (get the shortrib benedict-- amazing! & Scarpetta are A+) and the Marquee Club is sooooo much fun!! There's also a secret pizza spot that rivals New York pizza (for the West Coast, at least!). . I am not a gambler- but gave it a try for fun and even the people working in the casino were super nice- they taught me how to play 21 and were very patient. They could have easily rolled their eyes at me and told me to buzz off!! . . For the size of the room, hospitality, and overall experience- I think it's the best deal you will get in Vegas. Will definitely return!
Pretty hotel..but NO COFFEE MAKER!! Paid $15 for them to bring coffe to my room and it was only enough for 2 cups!! And the fridge only has room for their stuff that they want you to buy! And a small freezer area. Not that serious! Thanks but no thanks Cosmo! You can do better!
Stayed in a lanai suite and it was perfect! The rooms are very well decorated and have a very masculine feel with leather strap decorations and bold manly colors. This is the first time that I've stayed at the Cosmo and let me tell you that they do everything in they're power to make you feel fantastic! Gorgeous rooms and the casino, well that is a whole different story. It is elegant, sexy and luxurious! This is my new Vegas property from here on out!
Is it weird that the smell of the hotel is one of the reasons why I liked the place? None of the other hotels had this distinct smell. It was fruity? Can't describe it....you'll just have to go there and take a wiff at what I'm talking about.. . Being one of the newer hotels, I expected nothing less. The decor is gorgeous. From the moment you enter the the hotel and throughout the entire place, you will find very chic decor and furniture. Of course, the chandelier was the main attraction. The staff is great and the restaurants in the hotel are awesome! The secret pizza place and Wicked Spoon are a must when staying at the Cosmo. Also, the Boulevard Pool is sweet. It's a day club in itself! Very very chic and spacious, and I love the idea of having a cold pool, a warm pool, and a hot tub.. . The room was...average. It was pretty small but we had a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains, so we were able to watch the show from our room. The one thing I disliked was the window to the shower. There's a full length window that has blinds only accessible from the OUTSIDE. This means that to whoever is taking a shower, they better pray that the people sitting on the beds outside the bathroom aren't dbags. Unfortunately for me, when people are drunk, all reason flies out the window, and I found myself yelling at one of the guys who pulled the blinds on me in a drunken stupor. Also, I figured out that if the light in the bathroom is on and the lights in the bedroom are dim, you can see every silhouette in the shower. Makes for awkwardness. Feel like this window feature can do more bad than good..... . Anyways, great location on the strip, close to all of the other great hotels, and has a lot to offer. Definitely a great hotel.
Stayed here 2 times in a row for the 4th of july holiday. Last year had a terrace 1bdrm in the east tower. Was perfect for our party of 3. Spent most of my time on the awesome balcony with the lovely views of the Bellagio. The east tower is closer to all of the Cosmos amenities and establishments and the strip, but further from the cabs. Had really good times and the Cosmo's central location was such a relief for making moves easily and the lovely ambience and was always so nice to come back to. I was always so pleased with my choice to stay here after visiting other hotels for venues. The Cosmo looks and smells so nice! (Yes, it has a nice fragrance throughout the hotel, other places smell quite old and musty, so its noticeable and memorable) Also worth mentioning, the Walgreens and liquor stores are right across the street. Our great experience last year led to us making another recommendation for us to return this year, this time with a party of 5 for a bachelorette/birthday, we got a terrace suite this time, but with a connecting one bedroom like last year. The terrace suite gave us a full kitchen with fridge where we could comfortable store our booze and left overs, (big deal, cause in the regular room theres only a pre-stocked mini fridge with no room to put your own stuff) also the terrace suite has 2 additional bathrooms which is so essential when rolling with a group of girls! With our connected 2 room setup, we had a total of 2 king size beds and 3 bathrooms, and we got a good deal on the room rates by booking directly through the cosmo with their 1 free night promotion. This time around we were in the westend tower, the view of the Bellagio fountain and strip is further back than it was last year when we stayed in the east tower, but the suites only come in the west tower, and the view of the Bellagio fountains didn't really matter since they barely turned it on this year. Staying in the westend towers was the reverse of our last stay, because it was more convenient for getting cabs, but then we had to walk across to the east tower many times a day to get to amenities, such a secret pizza, chandelier bar and the pools. I'd say if you're not staying in a suite, try and request the east tower for more convenience. But the view alone from the west is really not that bad. Based off of our first experience, I would have given this place 5 stars, but unfortunately the quality of service noticeably dropped from the last time we were there. We had to call the front desk and speak to people several times to get simple requests, like more hangers and towels. When we did get hangers, they were wire hangers. Totally unacceptable. Then having a suite with a "full kitchen" was useless, when there was not a single plate, glassware, piece of cutlery, a pot, a sponge, or even a squeeze of soap to wash a dish. None. We had to call down several time to get basic supplies to actually use our kitchen and rinse our wine glasses since we were drinking wine nonstop and they would take forever to bring a new set, and each time we spoke to someone, we were met with resistance and confusion. They wouldnt even lend us a pair of scissors, claiming that it was a safety concern, which is the stupidest excuse ever, when you have knives and glass in the room, how is a scissor anymore distinctive? And what kind of clientele are you hosting that is asking for scissors for such reasons? It was all very frustrating. Only after speaking directly with a few managers and taking names did we finally get them to roll up a cart with 5 of everything to stock the kitchen for our group and received a small resort credit which we spent at the overlook grill for breakfast, because we explained how disappointed we were in choosing this place, where they clearly made it a point to note the bachelorette/birthdays we were celebrating, but offered no incentive to acknowledge the occasions or make us feel special for being a returning full price paying customer, thats bringing more people and booking more rooms than the previous year. There are too many options of where to stay in Vegas, especially new ones, for the Cosmo to disregard or not give thanks and appreciation to their patrons for any reason. We didnt even need much, just a simple bottle of wine, or a small box of white chocolate covered strawberries upon arrival would have been a nice enough touch to make us feel good about dropping so much money just to be here, but the lack of stock, combined with the poor service and attitudes we met throughout the property, and frustration in trying to resolve all during our short stay, were very discouraging. I still think i might stay here once more, to give it one more try, because once all the stock and incentives issues were somewhat resolved, the place is still fine for their comfy plushy beds, great terrace views, and convenient central strip location. Plus its just pretty. Tighten up on your service and room stocki
An honest review of the Cosmo.... . First the good...location location location. The Cosmo is centrally located on the strip. If you don't want to have to check the car out every time you want to head out some where; this place is IT. The Cosmo caters to the 20 something crowd so if you are into people watching this place will work for you. Bell desk and valet was on the ball. They arrived when they said they will and even called me to let me know they damaged my car while in their care. It was barely noticeable so they could have just disregarded it I probably would never have noticed.. . Wicked spoon had some unique offerings like bone marrow and made to order ramen but is it the buffet to end all buffets?...not even close. . . The not so good.... . I found the front desk to be extremely condescending. I called for the grocery pkg but was transferred around like I'm the idiot. Nobody had a clue what I was asking for till I finally told them to check their website. It's listed under hotel amenities.... . When they finally brought the table settings and food to the room housekeeping must have moved things around in the refrigerator so of course  I get charged up the neck because their cans of red bulls and smart water was moved off their sensors. I called front desk to let them know it was not me that their housekeeping must have set off the sensors while moving things into the "subzero" fridge so please remove the charges. Their reply to me was not "oh sorry we will remove the charges" instead she tells me to not move the sodas and alcohols around if I do not want to be charged because they are all on weight sensors...oh really you think! I guess she did not hear a word I said to her.. . Empty beer bottles and water bottles were left outside on the wrap around balcony...just a slight miss by housekeeping.. . Housekeeping could not figure out for me how to turn on the stove or why some of the lights did not work. Eventually I figured it out myself.. . I was confirmed for a strip view wrap around balcony suite at check in but of course they don't have a room ready for me so then why confirm it...offer me something else instead...don't let me wait around for 2 hrs. . . I ended up in a 52nd floor west tower wrap around balcony suite... Still pretty amazing views of the strip and the fountains. . . I can keep going but I'm not going to nick pick this place to death. The Cosmo has it's crowd and it clearly is not targeting me. I will stick to the Mandarin, Aria, heck even Encore next time.
Gorgeous. The place to be !. Nice, confortable, modern. Everything that is needed to spend a fabulous time. I recommend this place !!!. Love it
Before I booked my trip to Vegas I asked my friends via a Facebook poll which hotel they would recommend. They all had mentioned how nice The Cosmopolitan was, but none of them had actually stayed there, just gambled, used the pool and ate there but they all loved it and assured me it was worth the price so I booked two nights there. I was extending a business trip for pleasure and had been staying at the Flamingo for a conference for the 4 days prior to my check in at the Cosmopolitan. I was so looking forward to staying in a nicer hotel since work had paid for the first part of my trip I got stuck in an older hotel. . . Upon arrival I was so excited and the man at the front desk was so sweet, but then I got to my room. It looked like someone had taken a nap in the bed, the tables were filthy and had not been wiped down and there were crumbs all over the floor worse of all the shower was disgusting, brown goo was dripping down the wall and the grout was black with mold in a lot of the places. I burst into tears because I had been waiting all week to stay in a nicer hotel only to get there and find such a disgusting mess. I immediately called down to the front desk and they sent up a house keeping manager who was nice but kept making excuses for how bad the room looked. Even the phone was filthy I didn't want to touch it. There was dust everywhere and the desk look like coffee had been split on it and no one had thought to wipe it up. . . The only good thing about this room was the view. It was BEAUTIFUL but after the housekeeping manager came to verify that the room "was not up to standard" She moved me to another room that was cleaner, but this room had a view of a parking lot. I was not happy. I essentially got downgraded. I had to tell her I will not take this room, the view is horrible. . . Finally she got me into a much nicer suite with a terrace. I was so exhausted by this time (it was going on two hours of trying to figure this out) I just wanted to be done and go lay by the pool. I had been in Vegas for 5 days and hadn't had a chance to lay by a pool at all because of work. By the time we had it all figured out the pool was closing. So I basically paid a 28 dollar resort fee to spend the day hoping they would get their act together. . . I honestly didn't look my new suite over that well. It had a lovely view but I had tickets to see a show at 7 so I had to get a move on. When I got back from my show I went to take a bath in their nice bathtub and there was dirt in the bottom of the tub and a ring around the tub, and to make matters worse there was black hair all over the place, at the bottom of the tub and in the drain. I took a shower instead because that looked cleaner. The vanity in the bathroom didn't look like it had been wiped down either. I wanted to puke. . . Finally I went to bed because was exhausted I fell right to sleep. In the morning when I woke up i pulled back the sheet only to find black hair all over the INSIDE of the bed. All over the sheets and pillows. The housekeeping manager stopped by later that day and had asked me how things were going and I told her about the dirt and hair and she didn't even flinch. No excuses no sorry she just told me to leave a note for the housekeeper to make sure to clean it better, but I am pretty sure that was her job not mine. I also went to have breakfast on the terrace that morning and found cigarette butts all over it and the chair did not look clean. The table had sticky goo all over the place. . . All and all I had a horrible experience. I do not understand how The Cosmopolitan gets away with having such a horrible cleanliness standards especially at a "luxury property" it was shocking, I've never stayed at a hotel with so many housekeeping issues. The only good thing was the employees by the bamboo pool and my view. The employees at the pool were excellent both days I was there, but it still didn't make up for the traumatic experience of actually staying at the Cosmopolitan.
The hotel itself gets 5 stars. I have to give them such a low score because of their security management. I was sexually harassed in the elevator my first day. (According to video the guy poked my behind. When I reported it I just said he touched my behind in someway since I wasn't positive what he had done) a security manager took my statement and assured me it would be handled. It wasn't. The tapes were not even reviewed until after my nearly weeklong stay had ended... . . On my second to last night, I was assaulted again in the elevator. I was 100% sober. The report does not say that because it was EDC weekend. I will admit I got in the guys face after he shoulder checked me and I was screaming and red hot angry, but I did not touch him or threaten to. I just made sure he didn't leave, notified cleaning staff who called security. I was extremely shaken up especially because this was the second incident of unwanted physical contact in less then a week! I have an anxiety disorder and nearly had a panic attack so the guard ex courted me to my room to take my medication then asked if I wanted the police called. After saying yes, I was taken to the security interview room. That is when things got ridiculous. I was still incredibly upset and had my friend with me. I was asked for my story several times, when the security manager (same one that "helped" me with my first incident) came in. When I said I wanted to press charges he scared and threatened me out of doing so. He said the guy who hit me could and would press charges against me in retaliation and that he would personally kick us out of the hotel as trespassers. When I asked to speak to another manager he denied my request. I felt trapped because I would have nowhere else to stay so I didn't press charges. . . When I checked out of the hotel I told a manager what happened he was polite and curtesy of course and he said he would pass it on. . . It was passed into risk management.. . The guy dealing with my claim admitted he did not watch the tape from the interview room and refused to do so because reports from that day did not mention the managers threats (surprise, surprise...) and that I was intoxicated. When I responded by saying that it was wrong that he didn't even consider the possibility I was telling the truth bc a report made by people working under the manager said I was drunk and that I changed my mind about pressing charges and it shouldn't matter because he can watch the video and hear the manager threaten me himself. He responded by saying he had watched enough videos and would not watch it. . . As I told him, I hope his (you or your) daughter, mother, or sister is never judged and treated the way I was after being assaulted and then further mistreated by someone who is SUPPOSED to get down to the truth.. . I am shocked that a hotel I paid $2000 for and charges more then that usually would tolerate employees speaking to a guest like that and bullying them. Even if I had been drunk he threatened me with eviction if I pressed charges! So wrong.. . Needless to say I am seeing what the Las Vegas police can do about this matter. I may not get anywhere, but I will do whatever I can to see that this doesn't happen to anyone else.
Finally stayed at the Cosmo.  It's always been over my comfortable price range considering we like to stay in Vegas for 4-5 days usually.  At $300/night that's a big expense for most.  However during this summer we got a 3 nights for 2 at already reduced prices so I went for it.. . Overall I'm glad I stayed here and would stay again.  It is very expensive.  This is a top-tier hotel on the Strip no doubt.  With Marquee dayclub & nightclub, fantastic restaurants, beautiful people and architecture, and a breathtaking view off any balcony suite - it ranks next to Encore as my favorite place to stay.. . People say why spend money on a room when you're only going to be in it for a few hours to sleep.  I disagree.  We want it to be a home away from home.  We want luxurious furnishings, amenities and fixtures with a large double-sinked bathroom and shower big enough for a party.  I'm sad I didn't get to try the jacuzzi tub - I will next time.  For me the balcony is the top draw.  Why other hotels don't have balconies in Vegas is beyond me.  Palms Place locked their balconies which will be the downfall of that hotel.. . Make sure you visit the Chandelier bar at least once.  Drinks are pricey so choose wisely.. . We also decided to go out to the Boulevard Pool.  Originally we were only staying for an hour or so.  We loved it so much we got a daybed and spent near $300 on margarita pitchers and food.  If you get a bed, remember they automatically add a 21% gratuity to the bill.  Not that bad, but read your receipt before you add another 20% by mistake.  Also unless it's a really hot day, don't sit under the misters or you and your things will get soaked - one of the reasons we ended up getting a daybed.. . Love the Cosmo.  Didn't like the slots.  They aren't loose at all and I tried a lot of them.  Save your money for another casino but come to the Cosmo to feel like a millionaire in their elaborate rooms.
I came last weekend for a bachelorette party. This hotel is aesthetically pleasing, although not near as lux as tons of the reviews on this site would lead you to believe. Also, be prepared to be treated like child as many of hotel policies are meant to restrain the apparently immature, stupid, and by 10pm? wasted guests that stay here. There are 4 pools at the hotel, none of which provide consistent sunlight during the day/evening hours as the hotel is in the 5-8pm shadow of the Aria next door. But that mostly doesn't matter as the pool closes at 7 anyway. After that, you ARE NOT ALLOWED OUTSIDE on the pool deck until the next morning when the pool opens.I'm sorry, I didn't know I was in prison on my vacation! I can't go outside to enjoy the hotel pool when I just paid $400 a night to stay here? WTF?  This is obviously to keep the intoxicated masses (potentially drunk and disorderly hotel guests) from throwing impromptu pool parties. Which means the other people staying here who would like to lounge by the pool and have a cocktail after 7 are out of luck. Moving on. Everything you want to buy on hotel premises is a shameless 3 to 4X's the price it would normally be. I spent more $ on incidentals and bottled water from the convenience store as I did at the bar. Rooms: Small as you would expect. Bed: fine not exceptional. Toiletries: Bigelow, not worth the price of the room! Mini Bar: don't move a thing because you will be charged. (This means you cannot use the fridge and get charged for one if you want an extra which is supposed to go where in your closet of a room?). . Yep, that's about it. I will never be back here. DO go talk to the concierge people before you leave to avoid having random sh#$% show up on your credit card bill when you arrive back at home. Nice. Do not bring children here. What is the point? The staff is nice I feel bad for them having to deal with the attitude of many of the patrons that stay here.
This is a great hotel, and definitely one of the best I've stayed at in Las Vegas. I can't speak to the pricing as I booked it on points, but they offered us excellent service as Marriott Platinum Elite members, and both of our rooms were top-notch. This review will mainly focus on the Terrace One Bedroom experience.. . The hotel itself has endless amenities, and I will not list them here as they have a website for that, but suffice it to say that you'll never run out of things to do even if you never leave the hotel. The lobby is actually really cool, with giant TV-tiled columns featuring animated designs. The Terrace One Bedroom, as you can see from the photo, is huge and very well-appointed. Not seen in the photo is the massive bathroom with shower, hot tub, and great views of the Strip.. . It's very accessible from the Strip via the casino and it's super easy to get around for drinks, food, or gaming. Just don't accidentally leave from the side entrance, or you'll get stuck off of the main walkway with no way back on other than hopping a fence.. . Great hotel, and I'd stay again in a heartbeat.
To be specific this revue is in reference to The West End Penthouse and Marquee VIP experience.. . Embarassing.....  I was the guest of a gentleman that I give a volume of business were he makes a nice income.  We also happen to be friends.  We were celebrating his wifes birthday.  . . Before heading to Il Molina for dinner we wanted to celebrate by opening a bottle of Dom.   We did not have an ice bucket in our room.  It must have been removed by the maid.  . . Upon requesting one from our butler "personally" not via a phone call HE NEVER RETURNED..   $4.500 a night for that kind of service.  What a joke.. . We also had a VIP table reserved at Marquee.   Unbelievable the time and disorganization to figure out who we were and let bring us to our table so we could spend a couple more thousand dollars.  How does making us wait an hour outside the club make any sense.. . GREAT hotel, amazing  beautiful place but stay away of your looking for any type of VIP service or appreciation for those that spend thousands daily.. not including the wagering....
Hipster heaven. Our 2nd stay at the Cosmo and we enjoy it very much....but we aren't hipsters. On weekends..the LA crowd seemingly take the place over..but during the week its much more laid back and enjoyable. early check in was a breeze...room is large..bed comfortable..bathroom is extremely nice....all you could want in a vegas hotel. we love the private outdoor patio...might be the only spot in vegas to have them! we used 2 of the swimming pools...both very intimate and comfortable. restaurant choices are many...but why the loud music almost everywhere? Really cannot say a bad word/ Glitzy and wonderful!
I didn't stay here during my trip to Vegas but I did go through it since I went to Marquee Day and Night Club.. . This place looked amazing.  Each floor, room, section, hallway all had their individual stories to tell.  Beautifully themed and masterly planned out decorations.  Felt like a million dollars walking through this place.  You can definitely tell this place is a step above all the other hotels.  You can also tell the crowd is very different from the crowd you'll see in other hotels.  . . That's what I love about Vegas.  You can find millionares and the homeless all within a mile radius of each other.
I have stayed at this hotel twice and both times it was amazing the rooms are really nice and modern. The service is amazing as well. If you have a chance to stay here I would.
The Eastside Tower Rules. . . My rating of the 1 bedroom suite I stayed in for two days: 4 stars.. *Large Patio. SO VALUABLE on a summer day and night in Vegas. No one else on the strip has them. Pop champagne, toast, relax. Watch the lights and the crowds of people! . *Usable freezer and big microwave (useful for restaurant leftovers or uneaten pizza from "The Secret Pizza Place" on the 3rd floor!- MUST TRY the "White" pizza slice!). *2-seater Bath w/ clear views of the Bellagio fountains and Vegas skyline. Amazing.. *Room-like shower.  . *Cool wallpaper and design elements . *Cool art books and mini library in room. . Note: As I have stayed in many different Vegas resorts, I can lend these suggestions happily:. *Room needs a "Master" remote that controls everything in the room- including the shades. *The mattress could have been more comfortable. . My rating of hotel environment, ambiance, and design: 5+ stars! . *This is THE most "beautiful" casino on the strip. The Cosmo hotel is the most aesthetically pleasing location you will find. I never ran into any kind of mess or trash of any kind. The check-in area- WOW! Very cool, alive, and creative. Everything on site was spotless and sleek at ALL times. Pretty impressive. Saying that the Cosmo lent much attention to detail doesn't lend much respect to the designers, so let me just say you have to see it to appreciate it! . . Lastly, as a loyal M-Life member, I love how the casino looks and the size of the rooms but I would suggest that the Cosmo improves their loyalty programs so it would be worth staying there more consistently. I love this hotel, but Vdara is still my #1. Enjoy!
Great hotel!. Hip fun and alive!. The rooms are beautiful with a  swanky hipster vibe.. The many restaurants are fabulous. A new place to try every night!. STK, Holsteins, wicked spoon. All e are must dos!. The best are the free lemon drop martinis in actual martini glasses while you play. Did I mention they're super yummy, too!. The valet offers water while you wait - a special touch that I love!. The pool is super fun with lounge chairs in the water so you can stay cool... Or maybe a chaise lounge by the misters.. How about the pool tables & foosball, & TV's  to keep you company?. So much good stuff going on!. . My only regret was the Neopolitan at the the pool. The advertised as ice cream meets alcohol. But all we got was a slushy for $20! I felt robbed. Definitely stay away from neopolitan.
This is a gorgeous property. I had a great time walking and playing in the casino. Be sure to check out the art work and videos of old school Vegas on the second floor. This is a must visit when in Las Vegas.
I had the blessing to be able to stay at the Cosmo for free during EDC 2014 week (Thursday-Monday) since my cousin got a comped room. The decor was dark, modern, and fabulous. There were so many things to do and just to explore here in the hotel. The chandelier bar was awesome as well as the bar with dancers above it (I forget the name) they had awesome music playing while we were having drinks Thursday night. . . We definitely enjoyed the secret pizza place! The white pizza with meat ball was amaze-balls. I'm not sure how much of a secret it is but they have their own listing on yelp so not so secret.. . We got a room with balcony and view of the strip not to mention the Bellagio fountains that was neat. The room was nice and spacious and the bathroom was immaculate. The crowd there was definitely a big mix between business, hipsters, fashionable folks, and EDC party go-ers. The hotel was definitely popping Friday afternoon. . . I will defintely be back to party!
I love it here. Hands down my favorite hotel I've ever been to. . . Blue Ribbon, the sushi place inside, is my favorite sushi place ever....  Beautiful atmosphere... Hella expensive, but definitely worth it.... . The rooms in the Cosmo are incredible, and just writing this reallly makes me want to go back... right now.... . It's super clean, very, very beautiful... And the restaurants inside are great :). . Definitely would recommend staying here over every other hotel in Vegas. I've been to quite a few of them.
This hotel is absolutely gorgeous. The chandelier crystals are breathtaking. . . I stayed in a one bedroom terrace suite. The bedding was top notch and the bathroom was luxurious. There was no counter space for makeup, but there were drawers that sufficed. . . The Japanese bath tub. AMAZING. Filled up quickly and was so relaxing with the view of the strip. Very big and deep. . . The minibar automatically detects if anything is moved, but there is a separate shelf for personal use. Neat! There is also a microwave but no dishes as far as I could see. . . Huge sitting area with a selection of coffee table books. . . Staff was very friendly. My boyfriend lost his wallet and valet and security were extremely helpful in helping us find it. . . At $400 per night, the Cosmo still exceeded our expectations. I'll definitely be coming back.
What a hip, trendy hotel, it's a tossup between this and Planet Hollywood.  Serious eye candy every where you look, it's literally like a niteclub with the music blaring.  Even the dealers were dancing a bit, lol. definitely not allowed back home.. . Love the central, hanging facade of lights, almost like a mesh pattern.. . Upstairs is their famous burger join, Holsteins and the highly-recommended Wicked Spoon buffet, which I totally regret not trying..  There's only so much food this stomach can hold.
This hotel is slowly making it's way back to my ok list.  Well, a free weekend here doesn't hurt either.. . Their players card program is much more generous than the big 2 (MLife and Total Rewards) and they have already sent both my husband and I separate offers to come back for a free weekend.  Not bad.  . . Last time I was here, I won a decent amount playing craps.  Might have to try my luck again.  . . Still not the best placeto come if you have kids.  Not that it's bad, but there are other hotels that are much more family friendly.  That being said, this is a gorgeous casino with equally gorgeous rooms.  If you're here with friends, this place isn't bad.  You can't beat the view from your balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountains.
Gross. Smells like they pump Axe body spray through the vents. It looked like the reject room of a trashy real it t.v. casting call.  Jersey shore wanna be guys and skanky drunk girls tripping over their cheap heels that they can't walk in. Girls passed out in the lounge and in chairs around the lobby/casino area. Trashy,  tacky decor. . We did not interact with any staff or try anything at all. The overpowering amount of trashyness prevented me from enjoying myself. I took one lap around to say that I have seen the place. Beyond that I couldn't hold my breath any longer. When I reached the door, eager to get some fresh air, I was nearly trampled by Pauly D impersonators who where swearing, yelling and yes, fist bumping their way inside.
I stayed at this hotel back in April and it was amazing! The workers are all very helpful and polite! The room was just immaculate! I stayed in the wraparound terrace suite and is absolutely a must to stay in! Rooms could be quite pricey but I defenitly will stay here again!
Here's the thing.  It's trying really, really hard to be something special but it's missing real elegance, service, comfort and amenities the well-heeled traveler is looking for.. . Number one - Bad coffee!  No Starbucks or Peets or even a no name coffee that just tastes good.  Watery, tea like, tasteless coffee.  . . The Cosmopolitan bills itself as a sexy, metro chic hotel but it was filled with small children running around, splashing in the pools and screeching.  As a parent of older children, I love children, but when I want a kid free getaway I didn't figure the Cosmopolitan would be literally swimming with them.. . We spent a day at the Bamboo Pool which calls itself a calm desert oasis.  NOT!  I already told you about the mountains of screeching children but let's talk about bad service or no service at all.  No one came over to take a drink order or to offer us snacks for 45 minutes. My husband spent the afternoon running back and forth to the bar to get our drinks.  Then much too late, a young girl sauntered lazily by to say "You guys are okay right?"  Uh wrong.  It was our anniversary so we were hoping to get a cabana on a Monday for a reasonable price.  They would not budge on their $300 fee.  So 80% of them remained unsold.  And these Day Beds they offer for $150 - NO SHADE.  Why would you charge people to lay on a mattress in the broiling desert sun.  I can get sunstroke for free at home!. . The room?  Well we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite, which was a really nice gesture.  But again, I wonder who designed this hotel?  It has a lovely sitting area/living room when you walk in but it feels uncomfortable because it's away from the verandah and it is dark.  It has a sink/bar area but no trash can.  In the whole room, there is only one small trash can in the bathroom, not even one in the toilet closet.  So if you're mixing a drink or preparing an appetizer, you have to go to the bathroom to throw out your trash.  . . Then there's this whole wasted space where the closet is.  It's basically a third of the room that's just a hallway with a closet in it.  And then there's the bathroom.  One giant shower room with a soaking tub in it.  Seems cool but the soaking tub is really shallow and designed all wrong.  It is very difficult to get into because the step in is so wide and then if you can manage to get yourself out, you are stepping out onto a wet, slippery surface.  The shower handles are broken. The bath handles are not marked hot/cold.  And the whole bathing area is exposed to the bedroom. I guess that's sexy to the twenty something crowd but decidedly not appealing to a woman who may want a little privacy.  And speaking of privacy, remember the whole closet/hallway area?  Well that's covered in mirrors but the bedroom has no mirrors!  So trying to figure out a place where I could get dressed in private and see how I look before going out for the evening was a challenge.  My husband had to stay in the bedroom with the door closed, so I could freely move about.. . Lastly, the verandah.  What a nice idea.  Guess what?  The Signature at MGM Grand has had them for years and they are wonderful plus real service, elegance and amenities.  Our verandah at Cosmo had an impressive view but one teeny, tiny piece of furniture on which to sit, blaring all night music from I don't know where, constant ambulance sirens too.  And as soon as you open the slider, the air in the whole room shuts off.  So there will be no sleeping with a little fresh air coming in.  Nope you either sizzle on the balcony or spend the whole night breathing in air conditioning.  . . The best thing about the hotel is the food!  China Poblano is amazing.  Extremely overpriced like all things Vegas now, but really delicious food.  The Chandelier Bar has exquisite, inventive cocktails for $15 a pop and not one peanut on which to nibble.  So you can't really hang out there and drink because there's nothing to soak up all that alcohol. . . So I will definitely be back for the cocktails and food but will not stay here again.  If you're looking for true elegance and service, Vdara or The Signature at MGM is a much better bet.
This is based solely on checking out the shops and walking through the casino, being I did not stay here. This ambiance is very nice and they have a club, the marquee, that gets very very busy at night. It looks like it worth checking out. If you are in Vegas this hotel is worth at least walking through.
Swaaaaanky!. This place is so posh. Strings of crystal beads hanging, mirrored walls, high heels... . It's a lot of fun to dress up and visit. There are some great restaurants and bars here, although I personally don't love the casino floor and tables (I prefer a few of the other casinos for gambling).. I've never stayed here, just visited to gamble, drink and eat :)
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #1:. Cosmopolitan = the gold standard; fantastic parking lot with green/red lighted spaces; casino area is not huge or overwhelming; high end bars & restaurants everywhere; 3 levels + a conference room 4th level with cool statues; a secret 14th floor swimming pool area with amazing view of City Center; the 3-level Chandelier Bar is a signature; top notch live music and club venues as well; zero smoke factor; hot dealer chicks and occasional go-go dancers; best craft beer bet = Holstein's (huge selection; better prices on bottles than draft)
Definitely my favorite hotel and casino on the strip. It's very girly and fun and fabulous! It's truly beautiful and very hip. The music is bumping from the time we walked in. The club at the front called Bond seems soooo much fun! Next visit I plan to spend more time at the Cosmo! Gotta check out the Liberace exhibit!
The journey for me begins with parking, because to me, parking is make-or-break for a good night's stay. While parking is almost never a problem in Vegas, I found the Cosmo parking garage to be quite nice. Spaces are marked with individual lights depicting whether the spot that you covet is empty or full. This is a true win in my book. Get in, get your spot, and get on your way. . . After a walk from the garage into the main hotel lobby, you continue your journey to your room. (For me, the Terrace Sweet)...  Your senses are given a show when you arrive to check into this interesting place. Images flitter across the walls providing you with distraction while waiting  to get your keys. Employees are nice and well put together. . . As you finally arrive to your room (a walk not as far as some hotels - such as the MGM Grand), you are greeted with personalization on the TV and telephone. . Crisp white and cobalt-colored linens adorn the comfortable beds. . . There is a small kitchenette with a convenient sink for your stay. Adjacent is a cozy living space with couch and table covered in beautiful art books. This didn't thrill my husband as much as myself. What a great touch! . . Each detail of this room was well-though through, even down to the wallpaper inside of the closet. If you are a Fornasetti fan, then you'll love the famous Fornasetti Plate wallpaper hidden within the closet. . . The restrooms have a beautiful iridescent tile on the shower walls. The mirror is large enough to prepare to look your best for the day. . . The private terrace is my favorite aspect of the room. This is a rare treat in Vegas. Your room comes with a lovely view, normally, and this is a great place to spend the sunrise or sunset- if you want to take time to enjoy these types of things while in the Sin City. I had the lower-tier view of the Henderson side of the building, but love this view, so I was thrilled.. . Other highlights:. . Secret Pizza - Simply the best pizza around. Maybe it's the fact that it's secret? (Well, not really anymore). LOVE IT! . . Marquee Nightclub - Love the different themed rooms here, but the club is quite claustrophobic compared to the larger open-style clubs that are usually seen around town. It definitely make this one unique. .. . but I just don't prefer it.  I do, however, LOVE the vast selection of artists that the Cosmo brings in to play/mix here. . . Artist in residency - Some of the best artists show off their work for YOU to see. . . The Henry - Not bad at all. I like to people watch here if I can get a good seat. . .  In nearby Aria - Jean Philippe Patisserie - LOVE the macarons. .  In nearby Mandarin Oriental - Mozen Bistro - EVEN BREAKFAST is amazing here. . . So - highlights in summary - Fresh view, delicious food, comfortable stay.
Gorgeous hotel! It houses Marquee Dayclub & Nightclub. I've only been in here to the breathtakingly gorgeous chandelier bar and to the dayclub. These represent two of the most gorgeous venues I went to in Las Vegas. I would love to stay at this hotel the next time I am in Vegas.
I stayed here for a night on Memorial Day and was very disappointed. First to start off the staff was terrible. We had come early to check into the hotel at about 12 and was told our room is not ready and we will be called when it is ready. The room we had was the wraparound suite connected to the terrace one suite. So as we were waiting in the lobby one of the "manager" told us we can not wait there and have to go sit at the bar. When we went to the bar they told us we have to buy a drink or we can't sit there. So we had to sit outside since they wouldn't let us wait anywhere inside. I even tried to talk to him and tell him but he obviously didn't care and was very rude. So 4 came along and we didn't receive no call. We went back to front office and walked up and asked if our room is ready and they basically said no it won't be for a while but we can offer a wraparound suite and a terrace one suite on different floors? I at this point told them I specifically wanted them connected for a reason cause there was about 5 of us for my friends birthday. So all they said was ok well you're just going to have to wait. Ok, So 5 came along, then 6, then 6:30 we get a call to tell us our room is ready. They give us 4 keys and we go up to find out only one key works and it only opens the wraparound suite door. We call them they say they are going to bring up 4 keys or we can just go down and get them. So we wait for about an hour to get the 4 keys in which again only one of them is able to open the terrace suite door. We call them and tell them how bad their service has been to which they reply ok will give you a 100 dollar food comp. So we said ok that's fine. We order food service two burgers and get three cokes from the fridge and a bag of chips. Then at check out they told us we spent $234 on that we were flabbergasted. They tried to put on other charges and stuff that has been moved and we told them we had not touched anything but they swore up and down we had and they even had to send security up to check that we hadn't. The only pros about this room is that it had a great view that's it. I would never recommend anyone to stay here ever! So many more accommodating hotels instead of this over-priced, bad service, and poor management hotel.
I returned from a 5 day extended Vegas bachelorette party. The hotel decor was beautiful. The purple and silver glitzy tones really captured my eyes and I loved the way the hotel looked at night. We ate at the Henry just for breakfast one day- good food. We utilized the Boulevard pool- fabulous! I was absolutely not a fan of Marquee pool. The bartender Damian was excellent at the Marquee pool party. The drinks were delicious. I didn't like that there was limited seating if you didn't purchase table service. We didn't select bottles because the weather was not cooperating. Now the cons- very quiet casino. Too much euro trash. I know that's not too nice but I felt like I was in the Gannsevort and being from NYC I was looking to avoid that exact meatpacking crowd. Nothing was remotely inexpensive as far as quick eats. No place just to grab a quick bagel. Egg sandwich at Va Bene 13 bucks. Insanity. Definitely recommend eating in Aria instead if you're looking to party all day. The hotel should also open a Illy coffee stand similar to some of the big hotels. I'm pretty sure Caesar's had several quick grab and go places for food and within a reasonable price point.  The other cons- I seen several rowdy disgusting vomit episodes once in the elevator bank and once outside the normal pool. Yuck. Security should look to diminish that scene more. Also 17.25 at Vesper bar for a martini is absolutely insane. I live in NYC drinks are not that pricey here. I feel like I shouldn't focus on the money aspect, but it was cheaper at STK to have a martini. However, I kept going back to Vesper because it was the best martini I ever drank in my life. So I spent 3 days at that bar. Amazing bartenders, but it truly lacks in other areas. I wouldn't stay there again but I would do a visit for a nice calm night/lounge atmosphere. For a nice high class bachelorette or bachelor party, book the Encore. Better crowd, less booshie, presumptuous nose in the air European snobs!
The place is classy and i love the design, it's high end utilities at the room.  the best on the strip for sure.. Rates are affordable.
Great hotel with the most beautiful lobby, although pretty extreme decor, but I guess normal in vegas.. . The staff was super nice and the rooms were awesome. My friends and I came here for her bachelorette and we came here before our check in time at 3/4? But they let us check in at like 11 which was great as I left at 6 am that morning haha. . . But besides the crazy people , this hotel is very well kept, very clean and spacious, and there's great air ventilation as well. We also wereable to get a pool view and I wish we had taken advantage of that pool more often because we only went once, but the pool felt awesome. If youre looking to get drunk in the water, but a dayclub is probably to much for you the next day then definitely check out the pool.. . My friend also told me that they allow pets where they even have a floor where its like fake grass and you can walk your dog there and let them play etc. She also mentioned that they have a babysitter service as well, so great if youre just going to a show or something (better not be goin to a club if you got a baby waitin for ya!!! shame shame). Home to Marquee dayclub/nightclub so very convenient if youre planning to go there and oh yea!... Secret Pizza place located here as well! ;). . But I'm all for the interior design especially the bathroom and the cool lighting and wallpaper. One of the nicer and fancier hotels that seems like they actually put in effort in the design :D. . STAY HERE!
