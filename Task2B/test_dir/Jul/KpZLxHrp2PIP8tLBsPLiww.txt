Disappointing. Although the service was good, the rooms were dirty. Found a pair of underwear sitting out in the open from the previous guests and the staff wasn't very apologetic about it.
I had a blast in Las Vegas this weekend but was disappointed in #MGMGrand Signature Suites. Having spent 15+ years of my life in the hospitality industry, I know how to judge exemplary customer service (or lack thereof). The front desk agents were curt and unapologetically rude. The room still had trash and glassware from the previous occupants and the requested call from the management never came. I also had to hold 30 for 30 minutes to speak with accounts payable upon my arrival home to contest their incorrect billing. I would advise my friends and family to chose a different hotel on their next visit.
The room was nice and clean, but the service was so so bad! We had many problems with our reservation and the front desk staff and concierge ranged from unhelpful to downright rude. For $200 a night, I expect the staff to at least be on top of the basic stuff.
Always my fave place to stay in Las Vegas....great accommodations whereby you don't feel like you are in a crowded hotel. Staff super-friendly, helpful and superb. Each tower has great amenities no matter where you stay. Great service, great rooms, I could go on forever! :)
Best place to stay in Vegas I have stayed at Wynn encore Caesars bellagio you cannot beat the signature towers. We have been coming to Vegas for 15 years again this is the best.
Loved the hotel- front desk people were fantastic! I had a couple of small issues which were cleared up and handled immediately. But- they put a hold on my credit card for incidentals- told me they would credit it and it has not been done! They charged my account! Tried calling their billing department three times and was disconnected!!! They took my money immediately but getting it back is a waiting game! Would recommend and stay again except for the billing issue.
My husband and I stayed here a couple of weeks ago for our honey moon and we loved it! We were on tower 2 floor 21 with a corner view of the strip and the city. The room was spacious comfortable and clean! It is a little on the pricier side but we would stay here again for a secial occasion. The only downside was that cleaning did take a while to get to our room so we simply just went to them and asked for what we needed. Other than that a great stay!
OK. We have stayed at a ton of hotels in Las Vegas. I have been going for twenty years and this hotel is great. It is off the Strip but not too far away. The valet has only ten or fifteen cars and you can get into the hotel without waiting an hour. We had a check-in at 3pm and only took us twenty minutes to check-in at front. We were here for our wedding and had other people checking into Stratosphere it took 2 hours to check them in there. The beds are comfy and three nights was less than 375. I would recommend this hotel for people with families or for a quiet Vegas experience.
I stayed here in May for a conference with the company I am with. . . We had heard the Signature Suites were much nicer then the MGM and we got a smokin deal so we were super excited to stay here. . . This hotel didn't exactly live up to the expectations. . . Anytime we called because we needed something it took over an hour. When you are getting ready for bed, and you need an extra pillow this can be really annoying. . . The rooms were a bit more dated then I expected but they have been up kept very well so it wasn't really an issue. . . We had to complain to the front desk 3 times about our neighbors that were very obviously smoking in the hallway (it's a non smoking hotel) . . But once we did finally receive help from staff they were all extremely helpful, polite, and nice. . . The private pools here got really crowded so we spent our pool hours at the MGM pool which has a lazy river so it's better anyways. . There is a short walk from our tower (tower 3) to the MGM and they have moving walkways so we didn't mind the walk at all!. . There were good parts and bad. I would stay here again when I go for my next training conference, but I probably wouldn't otherwise
I would like to first off say that I was really pleased with my room and the staff at MGM. When I come back I will be staying at The Signature BUT I will be booking through MGM. I booked through a company called Luxury Suites International, they own various properties at The Signature. They also employ their own staff for housekeeping and room service. The MGM staff can not help you with ANYTHING, they can not even send up bottled water to your room. The housekeeping and manager customer service is HORRIBLE through LSI. . . My first night there was great. However, the second day we were there our flask pouches went missing after housekeeping came into our room. I called down to LSI and talked to Jessica around 6 pm and she told me since the housekeeping staff was already gone for the day this would have to be looked into tomorrow. I then told her this was fine. She said that the manager named Dawn would call me around 8:30 am when she got in. Well 9:30 am comes around and i still haven't received a call, so I called and Dawn answered. I first started off by asking if we could have late checkout and she then told me no that the mattress was being changed out....ok that's a little odd. . . I then brought up the incident from the previous day, she then proceeded to tell me that since housekeeping had it marked down that we had our "do not disturb" light on they didn't enter and they can not do anything about it. I told her that yes we had our light on until about 3pm and at 3pm we called down and spoke to Jessica about needing more towels and she told us that we should just turn on our "housekeeping" light. So we did this and at about 3:30pm two housekeepers came in right as we were leaving our rooms. So we actually saw them enter. Dawn then told me that she would have to contact the head of housekeeping and get this figured out, she would call me back. Well this was the day we checked out and I still haven't heard anything back regarding this incident. It is a little peculiar that housekeeping had it written down that they did not enter my room when we actually saw them. Then to top it off my belongings went missing. AND to make things even worse the safe was locked and we could never open it to put our belongings in. This makes it seem like LSI is running some kind of scam operation to steal guests possessions and then falsify documentation to make it seem like they were never in the room.. . I would also like to add that I have even emailed LSI from their website and i have also gotten no response.
Wow, this place made me feel like I was in a foreign country with the level of service we received.  Full on resort style hotel, not your typical Las Vegas hotel.  The one and only downfall this place has is that it is a long hike to get to the MGM.  Yes there are moving walkways but if you get stuck in tower 3 like we were it takes 10-15 minutes just to get to the food court of the MGM.  Rooms were great, bed was super comfy, and again amazing service!
I agree with everyone else who says staying at this hotel is an amazing experience. We wereonly there one night, but it was a great stay indeed!. . We left Los Angeles around 5am and made it to Las Vegas at around 8:30am. I know that check-in time is 3pm, but I was hoping to be able to check-in earlier and enjoy the hotel since we were only staying there one night. I called the front desk around 9:30am after we finished having breakfast and the man on the phone told me he didn't have anything available and to try back at around 1pm.. . Hell no I didn't call back at 1pm! We drove to the hotel and valet took our car. We went to the front desk and I asked the lady if there were any rooms available so that we could check-in early. To my surprise, she said they had a room in the second tower and that we could check-in free of charge. What a nice gesture!. . The room was clean and the bathroom was huge (bathrooms and cleanliness are of the utmost importance to me when staying at a hotel). There was a jacuzzi and a separate shower that could probably fit around four people. Dual sinks and a magnified mirror for makeup application. Also, the toilet is behind a separate door and a small TV near one of the sinks. The bed was very comfortable and I loved having the kitchenette. I brought along my Bialetti Moka Express to make espresso and coffee in our hotel and the small fridge was very useful to store water and drinks. We had a view of the airport and the halls were especially quiet at night. . . It was about 115 degrees in Vegas that Sunday and as we walked the strip, we realized that we needed to get into the pool back the hotel. The pool was nice and not too packed. I know that each of the towers has a pool to call its own, but we went to the pool in Tower 2. . . There is an air conditioned hallway that connects The Signature to the MGM Grand. You don't have to worry about walking in the burning heat.. . The check-out was a breeze and it's so convenient to have your car brought back to you by valet. I definitely recommend this hotel when you're in Vegas!
1. Staff are not friendly and they are very condasending.  This is my exspeirence from the the front gate, Vallet and front desk. No one goes above and beyond or ever hear about Customer Service.. 2. Be aware that the towers except tower 2 close at night. . 3. The rooms are OK, but lack things like locks on the bathroom doors.
Pros- good for big groups, reasonable rates, on the strip..the guy who checked us in was very professional (didn't necessarily have some answers I like but he kept his composer) good worker to have though.... . Cons where do I start?. I was told my bigger suite wasn't going  to be ready for another 2 hours after their check-in time. And when I ask what do I get in return since I'm not getting a full night because the room isn't ready on time? They look at me crazy....after going back and forth I get a $100 voucher for room service.. . I ask what kind of rates or discounts do I get for the MGM night club? Again they look at me like I'm crazy....if I am staying at your hotel can I get something? Especially to your night club? Free ticket or something? Discounted rate? Something? Nope nothing...had to go to a different club at another hotel...didn't want to spend $150 to get into a club lol. . My friends were kind of loud at one point and the security tried to just come in like they are the police? I didn't let them and quieted down my friends. And they never came back. You can't just kick open doors guys! The security guy was really trying to just walk in. What if people were getting dressed? Big no no we are grown ass adults don't treat your guests like teenagers..... . The rooms feel out dated....the furniture looked worn and the room didn't feel clean at all.... . Checking out...not friendly at all....no smile at all..."thanks for staying" sounded very fake and rude.... . I was going to give a 2 but I felt bad.... . I don't like to give bad reviews but I was shocked at the service...you guys are MGM!!  I was thinking top notch but I guess not...
Why can't we give 0 stars?!  This hotel use to be one of my favorites! The past 3 visits have been nothing less than a nightmare. The first horrible experience the valet lost my key and blamed it on me and claimed I must of had too many drinks the night before and kept the key.  If that was so how would u be able to drive my car down to the garage. Then when my husband went down to the garage with him he found it.  When they brought the car up the valet guy took off and didn't help us with our bags.  Second experience was my husbands bachelor party they told them the room would be ready by 3 it wasn't ready Til 6 and the food they brought got ruined.   On top of that anytime they called for room service or the front desk someone would respond with an attitude  to them.   This past time   Well I have NO words other than they are the worst hotel on this planet.  Horrible customer services, unable to satisfy any customer needs.  They have an excuse for everything and it's always out of their hands or put blame on something or someone else.  I cannot express to everyone enough how this hotel is complete trash.  I would rather stay at circus circus.
I stayed in tower 2 overlooking the MGM Pool and the airport. You can see every plane landing and leaving Vegas from here. The 29th level room had a Jacuzzi, fs tv and a sofa area. It is very quiet and feels kinda isolated and far away from the Vegas action.. . The room has a kitchenette with a toaster, stove, microwave, sink and coffee maker. If you need any kitchen supplies. Just call, they bring it to you. Each tower has a pool, but rather go to the MGM pool. Tower 1 and 3 have a gym, which is open 24h for signature guests. The gym is fairly big, with many machines, free earphones, apples, water, towels. Even at night they are pretty rude at strictly enforcing their gym-shoe only rule. Spa was not included. Resort fee was 28$/night.
Absolutely loved this condo/hotel ! The 2 bedroom, 3 bath, 2 kitchen suite that we rented was perfect for our family of eight.  Two of the bathrooms had a small TV, double vanities, a huge jetted tub and a spacious shower.  The kitchens and living rooms (complete with a good size TV/dvd player and 2 sofa beds) were equally impressive.. . The Signature is compromised of 3 towers (we stayed in Tower 3) and is a great alternative to staying in the casino.....much more quiet and family friendly.  It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the MGM Grand Casino via an enclosed, air-conditioned walkway (perfect for avoiding the summer heat!).  Each tower has a swimming pool and a gym was located on the ground floor of Tower 3.. . Our family would definitely consider staying here again.
Just no. I came with a group of girls for a bachelorette party and the rooms were fine (clean) when we arrived but we had so many customer services issues it almost ruined the whole bachelorette weekend. . . There was little guidance driving into the hotel as far where we were supposed to park and drop off our luggage. They ended up telling us it would take 3-4 hours to bring our luggage from the valet but we had all the bachelorette decorations, games and outfits in our luggage! We had to go down and grab all our stuff ourselves. . . They brought us one tiny blanket and pillow after calling twice and asking for 4 pillows and 4 blankets - our room was half freezing and half hot! At check in the girl helping us messed something up and we had to come down multiple times to have our card recharged, then declined, then reimbursed, it was so crazy and no one was being accountable. . . Overall I hate the signature and I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least the rooms were clean and we had fun that weekend. Also, the sinks were making creepy water and gurgling noises all night - not cute.
The Signature is pretty nice and smoke-free which is a huge plus.  The staff was friendly and the cafe in Tower 2 had a very tasty breakfast!  When we would call down for extra linens or room service, it was very prompt.  The rooms were generally clean (see below for issues).  We had a bachelorette pre-party in our room and it went off without a hitch.  It connects to the MGM Grand and the other Signature towers through a tunnel like system complete with people movers to minimize walking.  We walked through the MGM Grand Lobby around check in time during our stay and saw what a zoo that was and were happy that we did not have to endure that Disneyland-on-a-Saturday-in-the-summer length line (or, Ramen-Festival-in-San-Francisco length line).  Free wifi!. . There were some odd things that I kept saying, "this is going on my yelp review" while I stayed there with some friends recently, though, that drove me nuts -- which is why I deducted 1 star:. . 1) The doors to get in to the lobby are not automatic which is OK but makes it hard to walk in when you're carrying luggage & there is not a door person.. 2) No free early check in -- we arrived about 3 hours prior to check in and the only response the gentleman at the front desk gave us when we asked if our room was ready was that "Check in is at 3."  I later found out from another friend that she called ahead to ask for an earlier check-in but they charged her for it.  We were not even provided with the option to pay to check in early.. 3)  Since we couldn't check in early, we opted to leave our bags with the bell hop, who was oddly located outside in the heat.  We all thought that was weird.  Luggage is placed in an air-conditioned room, though.. 4) You have to call ahead to receive your allotment of 4 plates, 4 forks, 4 knives, 4 cups, etc., and they charge you for it.  Booo.. 5)  We reserved a one-room balcony suite and they only provided 1 cup in the master bathroom and did not provide blankets/sheets for the pull out queen bed.. 6)  The TV did not work in the living area -- I would press the on button and the TV would turn on then off a few seconds later, press the channel change button and the volume would go up, etc.. 7)  When we got in our room, there was a dirty towel on the floor in the master suite and some prior guest left a headband behind that housekeeping did not see or forgot to pick up.. . I'd stay there again, even though the things above annoyed me.
Most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! The Jacuzzi tub was an unexpected surprise in a standard room. The room was nicely decorated and felt very upscale. The price was affordable. My new favorite place to stay in Vegas!!
Early check in and friendly service at the pool were the perks of this place. We were checked in early to a room that was not clean. Of the three days we were there housekeeping came once ( even though we the light on). We had to ask for amenities like coffee to be refilled. The vending machine in the lobby didn't work. You spend half the time traveling to the strip. It's not close. Then they have late check out that they offer the day of. What's the point of that? If I wanted to wake up early I wouldn't need late check out. Then of course at ten we call and it's not available. Big surprise. Never stay here. Too many good options in Vegas.
My wife and I are in vegas for our first time. We are staying in tower 1 in a balcony suite on floor 32. This place is so amazing! We have never been in such a beautiful room. We are blown away with all the luxury.. . First off the pros. No crazy chaotic check in/out. Very calm lobby since there is no casino in the immediate lobby.. . Room service is great and prices are very fair.. . The wifi is crazy fast and very strong signal.. . Top notch everything. From sub zero fridge and other appliances/things. . Cleaning service reliable . . Staff is beyond great!. . . Now a couple cons but nothing worth removing a star. . It's off the strip which kinda sucks. They should at least consider a shuttle back and forth to the strip. Its connected to the MGM by corridors so you can walk completely indoors to the MGM Grand but once again, it's a hike but all in A/C.. . No HD TV. It's all standard deffinition. Really surprised me with all the other luxury ammeneties.
