Staff when checking in were super friendly and very nice. Kudos to them! Price was "okay" so we don't expect a whole lot, but still... mold on the bathroom walls, had to call housekeeping twice for extra towels (waited 5 hours), game room for kids is outdated and BORING!, tv picture quality sucked, no room service menu, accosted at every corner by people trying to get us to sign up for something, trash in the hall ways... Starbucks was cool and made me happy. And I won like 6 bucks at video poker. Just whatever you do, spend the extra money and stay elsewhere cos this place has become rather disappointing.
This place smells like shit and cigarettes! Its like a ghetto disneyland for adults! Food is a rip off and they don't even have room service for dinner. The only good thing was the price but i will defiantly never stay there again!
I love MGM properties, but this place is garbage! . . My sister and I had a two night comped stay through MGM's app called myVegas slots where you can earn loyalty points to purchase various comps like free rooms food ect... . . We booked a double queen smoking room. They put us in a non smoking room. When we called to get a room change, it took 25 minutes for the bell man to arrive. (Which cut into some serious drinking time) When we arrived to our second room, the window was covered in graffiti! How can you miss that?!? The house keeper threw my $500 prada sunglasses on the floor so that he could climb on to the table to clean it! . . When we told our story to the front desk manager, she lied to us about the buffet comps she gave us... so we got screwed out of that too! . . We were playing at a slot machine and got ignored by two cocktail waitresses. We finally got a hold of one and she was one of the rudest people I have ever met! Pointing at me like I was some dumb 21 y/o that wasn't going to tip her... . . Forget this place and stay at the tropicana!
my best friend and I decided to stay here on our first ever trip to vegas, WHAT a terrible experience!!! our room was filthy, the bathroom seemed like it hadnt been cleaned at all! we called guest services to have them be very rude, then we got the front desk who said they would upgrade us to another room who took probably 30 minutes for the bell man to show up! we finally get to the second room and the key has to be inserted several times to open the door,which was sticking!! after all that we were starved(and in a hurry to get food) we hurriedly went to the food court but the forgot our room number, so we called the front desk asking them to confirm for us,they wanted us to come all the way down to show id just get our room number, we put up a fuss so were put on hold for a manager who simply confirmed info over the phone!! . . whew! after all that we finally ate, took a nap and didnt get to enjoy our first night in town!!. . would never stay here again.
got to admit, I really thought the worst of this place when we were pulling up to valet and find that it was full. We drove around in circles trying to find a nearby parking because we really didn't feel like walking around with that much luggage; we finally parked in the parking structure. It was a drag carrying all that luggage all the way to check in. We ended up getting a room in tower one, which is a regular room. I was surprised to see that the room was really nice. I like the fact that it has a shower instead of a bathtub and the bed was SUPER fluffy and big. The rest of our family got upgraded and the rooms did look nicer due to the decorating, but the beds were way more firm. I definitely liked this room better than when we stayed at The Quad. If we come back here again, I'm definitely not taking the free upgrade due to the firmness  of the bed, unless it's a suite.
Excalibur is a relatively inexpensive hotel in comparison to other hotels on The Strip. There are two hotel towers. Tower 2 is preferable as it is the tower that is renovated while Tower 1 is not. It is not like you are going to stay in the room that long. . . It is interesting that Excalibur charges a tax inclusive daily resort fee of $20.16. However, the higher end hotels also charge equivalent amounts so I don't really understand why they charge so much for the resort fee. Also, I was somewhat annoyed that they charged an early check in fee. You cannot check into the hotel until 3pm. I know that some other hotels on the strip do not charge an early check in fee.. . The good thing about Excalibur is that they have a food court that won't break your pocket book. Even though most of it is fast food, at least you know how much it will cost you. They have a McDonalds, Pick up Stix, Baja Fresh, Johnny Rockets, Buca di Peppo, etc.. . Excalibur is so convenient that you can have a wedding on the property at their wedding chapel. . . If you need a no frills place to stay without breaking your pocketbook, Excalibur is a reasonable place to stay, especially if you are able to get accommodations in Tower 2.
I'll give it two stars because I kept winning in the casino but PLEASE just gut this hotel and start over. ;/  Ok fine, it was cheap... but honestly just a little more money could of gotten me a nicer stay at Luxor and even the Luxor rooms aren't that nice. Skip a meal or two, bring your own drinks and spend the money to stay at a nicer MGM property.
Excalibur very pleasantly surprised me!. . I hadn't stayed with them in over a decade, but a comped room and buffet thanks to my aggressive MyVegas slot and blackjack play (http://myvegas.com/) recently brought me back.  I don't know if all rooms are like the one I got (I think I was upgraded 1 level from the bottom), but mine was very obviously completely renovated, and super clean.. . As an MGM Pearl card holder (2nd tier players card), I was able to skip the check in lines.  This is a pretty nice perk, as I believe it's usually Gold (3rd tier) and above that get that benefit at other MGM resorts.. . The buffet surprised me as well..  I mean, the last two proceeding buffets I've had recently were Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon, and of course it's not like those.  But at a fraction of the price, and the fact that it has improved greatly from my last time having it, I'd definitely recommend.. . Excalibur is currently slightly cheaper but in better shape than Luxor.  If you're going to Vegas on a budget but want some decent quality, definitely consider Excalibur!. . PS - The resort fee is currently about 20 bucks.
The worst hotel I've ever stayed!!!!!. Me and my friend lost our luggages when we stayed in Excalibur hotel! Out whole luggage was gone inside has my new purchased Chanel bag and all our clothes, shoes, camera, iPad, cosmetics...We left the hotel at 5:45 in the morning and when we came back at 4:30pm, everything was gone except our slippers! The security guy said someone opened our door 4 times use the key card! But Excalibur said they are not responsible and we can't check the security camera! They say they will investigate, but after we leave no one called us! And no one mentioned to compensate us! Can't believe such a big hotel can even find out about who took our luggages and left the hotel!!!
This isn't the ideal place to stay for people my age because this place is ancient compared to the more happening places on the strip, but there's a lot of value in Excalibur's low price-per-night establishment.. . As an Mlife member, I absolutely have to stay at an MGM-operated resort while in I'm in Vegas, but because I was here for business, I needed to keep costs low, and I was luckily able to secure some rooms for around $30 a night--again, not bad for a strip hotel.  Through some sweet talk, I was able to upgrade my room two tiers for free, but there really isn't all that big a difference with them.  Tower 2 has better views than Tower 1, and that's really all I can think about it.. . My biggest gripe with Excalibur is that there's no Wi-Fi here (yet), so that prevented me from getting any work done in my hotel room.. . The gambling here is so-so.  I like that the craps table (the minimum actually goes as low as $5) has all the bonus bets that the MGM Grand has, and I noticed that it's pretty much like that for all craps tables operated by MGM.  When I lose I normally bet at another casino, as long as it's an MGM one, and that strategy has been working.  Excalibur is within walking distance to Luxor, Mandalay Bay, New York New York, Monte Carlo, and the MGM Grand, so it's easy to stay within the mLife confines.. . But what really gives this place its value is the fact that it has its own food court, and places like McDonalds are open 24/7, so yes, it's the perfect time to stock up on Spicy McChickens when things aren't going your way.. . Plus they have Dick's Last Resort!  Never tried it yet, but I felt that was worth mentioning.  . . Excalibur isn't a bad last resort if your wallet's shy.
Four stars because they showed us love during a hard time. Father was at a local hospital for about two weeks, told the representatives about our situation and they helped get us the best rates possible. I can't speak on any other yelpers' experiences of this place but mine. Room was acceptable. Nice gym and spa. Cool pool for the kids. Food just downstairs. Security guards a little too excited about their jobs if you know what I mean. Place is a little aged so of course it's gonna show, I think it's as old as I am (30). You get what you pay for, so if your a yuppie take you tail to the Wynn or cosmopolitan, that's if your willing to spend a pretty Penny. Otherwise have some realistic expectations and this place might impress you.
Peaceful weekend and my room was very clean. Excalibur has made some room upgrades. Not too pricey depending on when you book your room. Excalibur is in the heart of the strip and take advantage of the monorail to different casinos.
Let me start by saying, nobody should stay at Excalibur and expect a Bellagio or Wynn type of experience.  I would wager that people who post the most favorable reviews of Excalibur began their stay with an expectation of a Motel 6 type of experience.  People who post the worst reviews may have genuinely had a bad experiences, but some could just have some up tight ideosyncracies.  My advice to anyone is READ THE REVIEWS.  I wanted a cheap, clean room without any frills and that's what I got; AND Excalibur has a great location on the Southern end of the strip.  . . TIP:  When booking ANY hotel room during a Las Vegas summer, ask that a "note" be put in the reservation requesting a Northward-facing room.  Remember, the Sun rises in the East, sets in the West and the last thing you want is a room that is facing the afternoon Sun.  A room facing the North will always be easier to cool in the summer.  It's all subject to the architecture of the hotel, but generally the order of preference is North, East (by noon the sun will be over the hotel and out of your window), South (true South rooms may catch some angle of the sun during the entire day) and lastly West.. . Now I always make it a point when dealing with the front desk person at check-in is to kill them with kindness.  Remember, they have probably checked in over 50 people by the time that they've gotten to you.  So if you seem laid-back, make a few jokes and smile, you'd be surprised how willing the front desk person will be willing to make a last minute change or even give you a free upgrade.  Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  But it never hurts to help them help YOU.   . . TIP:  There is a coupon book that EVERYONE gets when checking in at Excalibur.  This book includes a $20 food & beverage credit coupon.  Be wary when booking a deal at Excalibur that mentions a free $20 F & B credit; since everyone receives this at check in try to find a deal that simply offers a better rate.  You'll get the coupon book anyways.. . There's been a lot of talk in these reviews about staying in Tower 2 for a better, cleaner, more modern room.  I decided to roll the dice and book the cheaper Tower 1 room; I always had the option to switch/upgrade later on if I didn't like how the room looked.. . The tower 1 room was clean - no smells or odors.  The bed sheets were really white...I'm talkin' either brand new or bleached well.  And they felt as if they had a pretty good thread-count (for those who are into that sort of thing).  No matter what hotel I stay in, I always undo the bedsheets to check for signs of bedbugs - mattress was all clear.  The bathroom was clean - no residue, mold, etc. in the shower or sink.  I will say that the fan vent in the bathroom looked kind of grungy, but that appeared to be the only issue with the room.  TIP:  As for the wired internet, I planned ahead and packed an extra length of 10/100 ethernet cable & coupler so that I could plug in my laptop and lie on the bed.  . . The casino was fun!  Sure it smelled like smoke, but what casino doesn't.  If you've been curious, but intimidated by Craps, check out the 12 Noon craps class.  Sometimes after the craps class has ended they occasionally offer $3 minimum bets for the first hour!. . Overall, I had a really good stay at Excalibur in a tower 1 room, but it must really be luck when booking here.  One afternoon, I overheard my neighbor who was coming out of his room and discussing his stay; he stated unequivocally that he "was never staying here again."  And this was the room right next to mine!  No rhyme.  No reason.  I didn't ask him to clarify, but he was adamant.  I just don't understand why I had such a positive experience and he didn't.  My final advice to anyone is to just set proper expectations; think of Excalibur like it's Motel 6 with a casino and you will have a blast!
Boop
I just got back from Vegas today. I ended up staying at Excalibur again. I don't have anything against this place it's just been like my 3-4 time in 2 years lol. . . My boyfriend and I planned on a last minute bday trip to Vegas and Excalibur had the cheapest price for a hotel that's not the best but decent enough for us to sleep since we 're not going to be in the room that much.  I also like Excalibur because it's attached to Luxor and Mandalay bay. I think staying in one of these hotels is perfect  when it's 100 degrees out.  You can walk through the hotels without stepping out in the sun.. . My boyfriend and I were playing on a slot machine waiting to order drinks and 4 different drink servers passed by saying they can't take our orders it's not there section.  etc.. So is anyone working that section? Does anyone work there? Went to the lack jack tables and still no cocktail services .. Horrible. . . But yea, it's not that bad of a place if you just need a decent place to sleep for a cheap price.
This was the first stop on a week long vacation. We chose the Excalibur because it was cheap. We paid $50 and $20 was comped back to us. We used the $20 to buy two of the worst Midori Sours we've ever had.. . The room itself was clean and comfortable. We couldn't have really asked for any more in that department.. . The worst part of the stay was the salespeople that the hotel had strategically placed at the entrance to the hotel rooms and food court. We fell for the pick up line once..."is this your last night? Where are you from?" When we stopped to talk we were given the hard sell. After that we were forced to be rude to everyone else that gave us the same line. I was just think 'I'm hungry or I'd like to go to my room. Leave me alone.'. . The lack of wifi in the room was another huge turn off. You could hard wire your computer in to access the internet but you can't use an iPad or phone to access it. What an inconvenience.. . The Excalibur is definitely a no frills hotel. The old addage is true...you get what you pay for.
Decent budget/economy hotel/casino with some pluses and minuses.. . They do have nice rooms, but you get what you pay for, newer renovated rooms are in Tower II, Tower I still has un renovated rooms but all units have updated flat screens.. . This is a good location if you need to keep costs low, you can get rooms as low as $20-30 a night, plus the $20 resort fee.. . The location is good, easy to find free parking and valet (don't forget to tip the valet) if you use a rental car, plus its connected to New York New York, MGM Grand, Luxor and Mandlelay Bay via the tram or a short walk. This can be also a negative as you have lots of foot traffic breezing through the casino.. . If you are on a budget, there's an AM/PM across the Tower I exit on Las Vegas Blvd where youcan get a cheap cooler, and drinks for the room. Plus there is a large food court with all sorts of chains inside offering cheap eating options if that is a concern [and as a bit of trivia, the Excalibur has one of the two Mc Donalds locations in the world that serves pepsi products instead of Coca Cola].. . In Vegas I did my usual clean sweep with my room, keeping my luggage sealed in the bathroom while I turned over furniture, pulled out cushions, pulled all the sheets off the beds, looked under and in between the mattress and piping/stitching, etc. It's a 30 minute ritual, but I hate bed bugs, and while my room as dated, it was.. very clean, I slept well for a week there.. . Bathroom was basic, no tubs, just a large walk in shower.. . The internet sucks, wired only in tower I. Not sure about tower II, there is wifi on the casino floor in spots.. . Pool is ok, 3 pools, a shallow pool, a large landscaped pool with a waterslide and an adults only [$10] pool area. Cabanas range from 150-300$ when I last checked, its worth it if you have a huge group that can split the bill and catch a big game and get a few free drinks and snacks, etc.. . The spa and gym are nice... not huge but decent enough in size to get a workout done. I believe the gym is covered with the resort fee, however the spa does cost $10, which you get steam rooms, a sauna, hot tub with a relaxation room with free drinks and juice and toiletries so you can shave/brush your teeth, etc.. . Dicks was humorous.. the gimick of the bar is that the wait staff is susposed to be a bit rowdy and off color with their jokes and humor, don't go there with thin skin. I'd watch getting generic cocktails.. there is value to be had with some drinks but not others, one of my party got nailed $22 for 2 tiny rum and cokes in a little plastic cup. Food was decent.. . You also have an italian restaurant there with large family style portions to share, a below average hotel buffet, an average steakhouse and a few bars and lounges.. . Basically its... "OK".. . As for the general feel... remember the end of the movie Casino? Everyone looks like they are at disneyland. Fun to people watch if you get a good spot.
Very fun hotel to stay at. It's like a giant Medieval Times. The rooms are pretty standard. This place hosts the dinner and tournament in their lower level. A good time was had by all. I think this would be a better choice for people traveling with kids. Also must try their goblets! Refills are cheaper if you buy the souvenir goblet.
So disappointed because we stayed at Excalibur last year and loved it. This year was a little different and we probably won't be back.. . Ok it's a very good price for a strip hotel and the location is great. It's an older hotel but that's never bothered me. Our big draw cards coming here were the location, the price and the pool. Last year they had an adults only pool where you could drink, smoke and generally not be disturbed by those under 18 (which, staying at a themed hotel like this, is harder to avoid).. . So imagine our disgust when we get to the pool on our first day of ten and discover it now costs $10 a day to use the adult pool!! This is nothing more than blatant money grabbing, and left such a sour taste in our mouths. Coupled with the resort fees that don't even cover wifi in the rooms and pushy sales people at the entrances, we were extremely disappointed.. . I mean really, I know the sales people are only doing a job, but one night my friends and I were struggling down to our rooms after being at the supermarket LOADED with heavy pallets of water and food, and one of those people tried to stop us...I snapped at her "Are you serious?!" A little logic goes a long way!. . So unfortunately for our yearly trip to Vegas we will now have to look elsewhere. It's a good basic hotel if you just need somewhere to sleep, but for our 10 days it was too long without a decent pool area and being hassled by the sales guys every day.
It was a fun place check in took a while but staff are pretty friendly service was good food was awesome can't wait to go back
Didn't get a chance to stay here but I did play here!  Some of the friendliest blackjack dealers I have played with.  Makes a big difference.  3/2 blackjack is important to anyone who is series about the game.  Good food choices, friendly service people, clean casino.  Connected to New York New York via walkway.  I will play here again.
Never again.. . I had stayed here a couple of times previously which were mediocre, but not really bad.  The last time I stayed for business with coworkers, and after checking into my room I went to the restroom and found feces still splattered on the outside of the toilet bowl.  If something as blatant as this wasn't cleaned prior to check-in then I am terrified to consider what else remains unsanitary.. . Even worse I was sent a survey following my visit in which I detailed my experience.  Have never received a word of feedback from the hotel. What exactly is the point of asking for a survey from guests if you don't acknowledge them when they place a complaint?
Excalibur is the "bang for your dollar" hotel located on the strip. It's not the nicest looking, doesn't have the most amenities or the most up to date decor.. . It gives you the opportunity to be on the Vegas strip at a cheaper price compared to other hotels. If you come with kids or have a big family you are traveling with then Excalibur will offer you value in staying in Vegas.. . I had a bad experience with my check in where I was offered a free upgrade offering the pool view and adjacent rooms where we could open the doors to each other's rooms. Neither of those happened and we were too exhausted from the drive to complain or change rooms. . . The pool was great for the kids. They have a single slide there for kids and adults. They have a VIP pool as well. Drinks are expensive, as you would probably imagine. We ordered a bucket with 5 beers and it cost $30.. . I would stay here again and here is why: I come here to walk around Vegas, not sit in my room. I don't care to pay for an expensive hotel that I come to sleep in.
Stayed here with my family last weekend and don't really have anything too exciting to add. The rooms were ok but could of been a little cleaner. The shower had a lot of soap scum on it and there was a black pube lying on the floor outside the shower door. The molding was coming off along the bottom of the wall just outside the bathroom. It was just ok, not a whole lot to do in the hotel except dodge the sales people trying to sell you shows every time you turn around. We did enjoy Buca's Italian Restaurant except it cost us a fortune to eat there. Will probably stay somewhere else if we visit again.
The first day I arrived I was told that there weren't any two queen size beds available in non smoking. I had to take the king size bed and a roll away bed for the first night. The room was clean but was very noisy due to ac.  I had to call the next day to see if there were any rooms available and was able to move to a better location in the tower overlooking the strip. The hotel has very old decor and its at the end of the strip. It was away from everything and no parking at night. I was told there would be free drinks if I gambled but no one came to take our drink order. At the rio I got drinks left and right for free. I just had to tip. There are too many younger kids running around the casino. I wouldn't stay here again.
The Walmart of Las Vegas hotels. You get what you pay for. Very basic rooms. Pool is like a public pool.
"Outdated Medieval Casino/Hotel". I will have to say that the outside castle and Medieval times theme from the outside of the hotel can surely attract one with a curious mind inside. They have a bit of rennovating to do and if you have kids I guess the shows they offer here are cute.
This is a review for the hotel portion, and a bit of the casino. . . A friend and I stayed here for a few days in Vegas, mainly because the price was really low. I'd been to the casino in Excalibur before so I knew we weren't staying in the ghetto or anything. The hotel is okay, it's pretty old and dated, but chances are you're not coming to Vegas to spend all day at the hotel. I was a bit suprised how normal looking our room was, no cheesy knight in shining armour statue or King Arthur quote on the wall. It looked like a regular hotel room, so if you want something really themey in your hotel Excalibur isn't the place. Then again I don't know if any of the other hotels are any different. . . One thing that was really frustrating about this hotel (and I'm sure most of the hotels on the strip do this) was the fact you couldn't get wifi in the rooms. You had to go down to the casino (and not just to the food court, but to the casino) to get onto the wifi, and then it would kick you off after about 10 seconds. I'm not super hooked up to my ipod (I didn't have a smartphone so I need to use wifi), but I wanted to be able to check in at home and let me family know I wasn't dead and such. . . Excalibur is on the far southside of the strip, so bonus is you're pretty close to the airport, but you're far from some of the other hotels. If you want to go to Mandalay Bay or Luxor there is a free tram that was pretty handy (although finding the pickup and drop off spot at first was a bit difficult). The bus stop for the strip bus and the bus to the outlet malls is pretty close by. . . There's a weird smell, kind of perfumey and musty in the hotel room we were in, which was a bit off putting. The food court isn't big, but I liked that some of the restaurants we opened pretty late. The casino itself looks like every other casino in Vegas, except Excalibur has a Medieval theme going on. Still if you've seen one casino in Vegas you've pretty much seen them all (except some of the ones on Freemont  still take coins). . . This was my second time in Vegas and if I ever go back I'd stay off the strip and try to explore other areas, but I don't regret going to Excalibur. If you're looking for a no-frill hotel on the strip this will do fine.
Good price it's on the strip and they upgraded the looks of the hallways and rooms it looks a lot better and cleaner
Excalibur used to be my go to place to stay while in sin city, but maybe not so much anymore. It's on the strip where I can access anything and lots of places/things are within walking distance. . . Sadly, the mega resorts have left this one in the dust. The rooms need a serious remodel or upgrades but then again, once that happens, the rates will go way up. It is still budget friendly and offers lots to do and eat without having to leave the castle.  The coupon book sucked this last time I was there. I found not a single coupon I could use. I don't want BOGO, I want FREE. Not even a free drink, damn. . . Not the best place to rest your head but not the worst either.
Love the price and location of this place.  The look is amazing and the stand up showers are plenty big for two :)
Its nothing fancy and the tower 1 is gross but the tower 2 is more contemporary and smells clean. We were upgraded from tower 1 to tower 2 after our toilet wouldn't flush and overflowed with a piece of tissue 5 minutes after getting settled into our room. Floor 23 room 221 has the most amazing view of NYNY and the strip especially all lit up at night, I'd ask for that room again. . . Housekeeping was a bust, never cleaned even with the sign on the door but it wasn't a deal breaker. Beds were comfy, atmosphere was cool downside was wayyyyy too many families with kids staying there, its Vegas people leave the kids at home or go to a real family vacation location because Vegas is not it.. . Location on the strip and cost is what made the experience not totally bad but I probably would head next-door to the Luxor or Mandalay Bay to stay on our next trip better food, cleaner, little to no kids, looser tables and machines plus not as many "can I sign you up" vultures.. . Overall not bad.
Been to Vegas 3x on vacation with the Kids and Grand kids!  If you have kids this place is alot of fun..   They have an arcade lots of shops and food court.  They are kid friendly.  the gaming floor was loud and lots of action.  the cocktail waitresses were nice and always their refilling our drinks.  The pool was fun and clean and the kids enjoyed it.  We walked back and forth to the New York New York they can ride the roller coaster...  Parking is easy location at the beginning of the strip good if you got a car and going to drive around don't have to deal with the strip traffic but a bummer if you want to go to the middle of the strip its a little ways down but we survived.
Was not too bad for the price!! Im very disappointed with NOBODY acknowledging my complaints i made 3 times !!!!! Until the day i was checking out !! And even when i made the last complaint i was told "we will check it out"  That is total bs !! And the wifi sucked , yet they charge a resort fee for internet  yet u cant even make a call home ... I know you are not always in the room but still !! Only upside to all of it was the food court was cool , plenty of choices and they were open late
Stayed for 1 night on a Tuesday. Purchase the cheapest price hotel room on their website.Arrived at the hotel there was plenty of parking. Check-in line was big but fast and friendly servive. Stayed at Tower 1 in the 17th floor. The pool was the reason why I stayed in this hotel it had a water slide and it was kid friendly hotel. Went in the pool and they had plenty of pools for a big crowed.My daughter love the water slide.They open the water slide pool late and close it early.The room wasnt the greatest but what do you expect when you pay the lowest room. Some people expect a 5 star hotel when they purchase a cheap deal. They had a game room for kids and games were fun and cheap not over price. They had all type of food in the hotel from Johnny Rockets,McDonalds, Popeyes and fast food. Great for when you are on a budget. On the night we stayed the fire alarm went off in the building at 2:30 am. It happens from time to time someone pulls the fire alarm. Check out was Super easy quick. . Pros: Kid Friendly Hotel. Arcade. 3 Pools. Fast Food. Cheap
This place has really gone downhill since I last stayed here. The safe in the room did not work. They only provided three bath towels. The room looked dim and dingy.  It does not feel clean at all. Will not stay here again.  The resort fee is a joke.  I thought we were going to have free Wi-Fi, bathrobes, And a newspaper in the morning. Nope! You can't even pay for Wi-Fi in the rooms.
We have been VIP guest for 10 yrs.  We are finished with this place. Our comps have dwindled down to nothing .  We are big gamblers and didn't win a penny.  We rented an umbrella space at the pool. What a waste of money, when the cabana girls leaves at 12pm everyone steals a place. When we left everyone was trying to take our spot. We will stay in colorado to gamble!
We went on a family trip & Excalibur was our first option since the last time we had stayed here was really nice. We came during the EDC thing was going on so it was packed, so the check in like was like at least 40 minutes ! I was really frustrated by this time because I was super tired from the car ride & I just wanted to lay in my bed & take a nap! Okay, 40 minutes pass by we go to our room, everything was good. UNTIL I saw our view we had the most beautiful view ever it was the ceiling & venting fans ! Excalibur did this again & I was like really Excalibur !!! So I decided this time to go & ask for a better view, guy in the front desk was super nice & said he would put us in a higher lever so he did ! I recommend staying in the remodeled rooms because the other ones are not as  good as the contemporary ones. After we had settled in our room (finally) we had a decent view. Everything in the room was nice we stayed 4 nights & we all had fun! I didn't quite understand the whole process  of having to show our hotel keys to the officers by the elevators but whatever.. It was a pleasant stay!
This is the second time we've stayed here, and frankly, it's just the Fun Dungeon (which the kids love) that brings us back.. Check in staff were friendly. The room was clean. I don't know if it's standard in Las Vegas hotels, but I wish the rooms had microwaves and refrigerators. I imagine they don't want you to stay on your room, but these amenities would be nice when you have kids.. The restaurant options are poor. We headed to New York New York to eat. . The pool was SO crowded. Of course. But, the kids didn't mind.. It's an easy place to stay because it's close to other hotels that have attractions. . In this case, the place is a good value. If your kids want to play until the fun dungeon closes, it's easy to stay and just suck up the other shortcomings: dingy room and okay food.
We stayed here because it was cheap and family friendly but I admit it is the first time I ever saw people counting out change to settle their bills. The staff is nice and the entertainment concourse is excellent -- particularly if you have kids -- but on the down side the decor is showing its age and we all came down sick immediately after our stay (low grade not feeling well). Good location and very affordable but if you can afford to stay at a better place on the strip, my advice is to do so.
As a young adult, this was not the place to be in late july. Had a youth Basketball tournament going on which swamped the place. Little kids everywhere anyway. . . The GOOD was that tables were $5 and I saved $100 on my car insurance. . . I was also on the 17th floor, at the end of the hallway. And I get hit on by alot of prostitutes this trip for some reason. who knows.
