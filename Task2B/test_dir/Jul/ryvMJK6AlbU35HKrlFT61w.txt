We absolutely love this place. We would eat there every week if we could. We use to go once every month, but at $55 per person with tea to drink gets expensive very quickly. You can sign up to receiver their specials, but it's not like it use to be. Last year we received a free dinner on our birthday, but this year it was only $25 off. It's an ok deal but still we ended up going somewhere else this year :(. . I gave -4 stars because even though they are a busy place, it's not an excuse for the waitress to ignore some tables. Sometimes I waited almost 10 minutes for a refill on tea or for her to just get some sugar.  Even waiting for meats to come to your table can be ridiculous and having to put a special request in just to get meat is frustrating. In my opinion it's still a wonderful place to eat on your anniversary.
We love this place! The food  and service is excellent!
Never had a bad experience at this place we love it . It's the bomb and is the best Brazilian food in Las Vegas !
This was my first time here I'm from Hawaii and my friend told me about this place it's $50 a person but it's well worth it. I had on of everything. Everything I are was really good. I also had a Texas cab wine that wine was dry but not to dry I'll give it a 7 or 8 on dry scale. It's pretty cool how you got to flip a card if you want them to stop by the table you put it on green if you want them to not come you put it on red. And our waitress Camilla she is very good. She recommend a lot of good wines and she is a really good waitress if I ever come back to Vegas I'm going to come back here again.
Have been to all of the Brazilian steakhouses in town multiple times. . . The food is fantastic, especially if you right at lunch. Their Brazilian sausages are better than the others. . . Where they fall short is in service. They are not nearly as attentive as the staff at Fogo.
All I can say: wear pants with an expanding waist band!!. . Who doesn't want to have endless steak, pork, chicken, ribs and whatever else delivered to you all night?!  Its all cooked to perfection and the guys are constantly walking around.  If you can't find the specific meat you want, simply say something to your very friendly server and it will come right over.  Can't wait to come back again soon!
Reservation for 5 adults, 2 children: 5:15pm. . We arrived and there are already people waiting. The restaurant looked busy too. We were seated quickly and staff was friendly. Our waiter was super attentive and knowledgeable. He made sure the gauchos with the meats we wanted more of, came around to our table.. . The quality of meats at TDB surpasses Fogo in Beverly Hills.. Filet - melt in your mouth softness with a great beef flavor. House sirloin - seasoned really well, juicy and cooked perfectly at medium rare. Lamb chops - tender and juicy, but it was way over salted. Leg of lamb - hands down the best meat I had last night. Super juicy and tender, no gaminess. You could tell you're eating lamb, but it didn't have that barnyard funk. I am very sensitive to gamey meats, but this was amazing.. Pork tenderloin -bit on the dry side, but flavored nicely. Good if you could get a bit of the crust with your slice. . Salad bar - super easy to get carried away here because there's a great selection of veggies, pickled things, salads (try the grape salad.. no joke, it's weirdly delicious), cheeses, bread, proscuitto, olives... I went overboard. I was in PAIN because I ate so much. The little cheesey breads? I wanted to hide them in my purse because they're so good.. . I enjoyed my dinner here immensely and highly recommend it to hardcore carnivores.
Meat lovers paradise!  Leave your diet and concerns about cholesterol at the door because it's gonna be a crazy flavorful ride!. . My friend's wedding reception was held at the beautiful swanky Texas de Brazil!  I will admit that I was a bit apprehensive about how a wedding reception at an essentially all-you-can-eat place would be but it was amazing!  After asking for the strongest knock-ya-on-ya-kissah Sangria, we headed out of the intimate and gorgeous banquet room they reserved for the wedding party and out into the salad bar area.. . They had gourmet cheeses, artisan breads, a wide array of salads, fancy olives, and all these delicious sides to offer and it was hard to pull yourself away but you got to remember that there's a parade of meats coming up and you definitely don't want to miss that!  So after loading up and consuming a fairly modest dish of cheeses and olives, the night became a symphony of skewers upon skewers of deliciously grilled meats.  Oh my.. . The waiters seemingly danced through the tables and offered succulent and juicy grilled meats onto our dishes and even politely suggested a few off the menu items they'll sneak in for us.  You would think that with a bridal party hogging up their banquet room for hours on end, they might get angry and try to kick us out but no.  Glasses were always filled, boxes of fancy teas were offered to the more modest ladies, and the food just wouldn't stop!  Please stop!  My waistline!  . . Texas de Brazil is an impressive and trendy restaurant with the most down-to-Earth people --- rare for a Las Vegas eatery!
Love love love this place! Definitely worth making the trip, and coming again and again. We came for my husbands birthday, and were able to get a $25 coupon from their website! Score! . We made reservations, so didn't have to wait at all. Their bar area is really nice if u get there early and want a place to wait...full bar and extensive wine list! Once seated we moved right into dinner. We have done authentic Brazilian steakhouse overseas, and this measured up and surpassed it! The salad bar makes others look like child's play. We didn't eat anything off of it though because we wanted room for the meat! Protein only for us! So many waiters came with so many meat choices...it was almost overwhelming at times! Definitely a fave place to go...everyone should try it!
Best place to eat and satisfy your craving for cow. Sure this place serves other meat like Chicken Parmesan, BBQ  pork sausages, rack of lamb and lamb chops but you come here for the cow, and how it tastes exponentially better than any other place in Vegas. The highlights here for me are the filet mignon, top sirloin, and garlic steak. This place is absolute carnivore heaven, and get ready to get your T-Rex on when the servers come around with the skewers full of meat. I just come here for strictlycow and cow only by basically leaving my pog on green the whole time when my plate is fully stacked with beef. I go get another plate and fill it up with a lot of spinach and veggies and go to work on the 2 plates. Strategy and having a good plan of attack is essential here when tackling this place. The meat here is BBQ'd Brazilian style with great flavorful seasonings. All beef is cooked and served according to your own specific tastes. If you like rare and your crew don't, it's okay....they have everything. The salad bar is awesome with fresh veggies like Tabuleh, sun dried tomatoes, garlic, ginger, beans etc. The cheese bread that they serve hot and fresh are gems also. The garlic mash potatoes have great texture and flavor. The fried cinamon bananas are meant to cleanse your pallet but damn are they sweet and fried well. It all melts in your mouth. Worth the $55 experience and over the weekend the $40 lunch menu is the best because it doesn't give you the 'itis like dinner time would and it's cheaper.
One of my favourite restaurants! My boyfriend and I absolutely ADORE Texas De Brazil. . . We first came here for our anniversary after getting a recommendation from my older brother. A lot of our mutual friends agreed that this place was the bomb diggity. . . The wait staff is VERY attentive. They fold your napkins when you are away from the table and are SUPER on top of drinks. All the food is delicious and there really isn't anything to complain about. . . TIPS AND TRICKS: . . I would suggest going to lunch rather than dinner. Dinner price is 50 dollars and lunch is 30. The only difference is that lunch doesn't include sushi, heart of palm, and buffalo mozzarella at the salad bar. I love the heart of palm and mozzarella but I'd rather have a cheaper bill. . . Lunch is also a lot more laid back than dinner. Not that fancy is a bad thing! It's just what you are in the mood for that day, I suppose. . . My favourites include the fried bananas, lamb chops, and Brazilian sodas.  I would also suggest getting a dessert, specifically the cheesecake. While it's not included in the meal, it's definitely worth the extra charge. And if you get the lunch with a desert, it's still cheaper than the dinner charge! ;D. . ALSO! MAKE A RESERVATION. THIS PLACE GETS PRETTY PACKED.
Talk about carnivore heaven! I was a bit overwhelmed at one point. Meat everywhere! . . Food is pretty good. Now I know what all the fuss is about. I came here for a friends birthday. We hadn't tried TDB yet so we were all pretty excited. We paid $50 each for dinner, note that drinks and dessert are excluded from the price. The price does include, meat, salad bar, fried bananas, mashed potatoes, and bread. . . Our waitress was very attentive and was always checking in, but not too much either. She always came at the right time and was very friendly. . . The salad bar had an assortment of things, ranging from cheeses to smoked salmon, and even sushi rolls. . . The meats were all cooked and seasoned to perfection. You get pork, lamb, steak, and chicken. All are equally amazing. I will be back!
It's always a must when in Las Vegas!!
If you like steak you need to go to Texas De Brazil. Its a non stop of delicious meats. My favorite was the beef rib and the filet mignon wrapped in bacon. The salad bar is very good also. Check this place out, your gonna love the endless amount of meats.
Came here on my birthday and until there is a Texas de Brazil closer to me, I'll be coming back every time I'm in the area!  I have to say the location was a bit far out from the Las Vegas Strip, even for a drive, but as always, the food selection is top notch and the quality is amazing.  I don't usually indulge and eat just to eat, but I do so here.  I have to shout out and say we had one of the best server's I have ever came across.  I feel terrible not getting his name but you talk about perfect service, this guy delivered it.  Packed house and was still able to not only check on us periodically, but remember what meats we liked and wanted and made sure we got them asap.  Just the best service I get from a restaurant and combined with how amazing the food is, it truly sets the bar for dine out experience.  You must try Texas de Brazil wherever you can find one!
