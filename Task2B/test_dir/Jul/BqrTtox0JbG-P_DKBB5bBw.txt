We started with the car bombs cuz my girlfriend loves cheezy jalapeno anything. really well done. Very pleased. We shared the meatball burger and the rising sun. both great. I added foie gras to the meatball burger which made it so amazingly rich with flavor it was almost too much. . service was thorough.. Will be returning next time around.
Even after hitting Wicked Spoon, we were still jones-ing for milkshakes. . . We sat at the bar to avoid the wait. The bamboozled milkshakes all cost over $10, but they are all boozey. I tried the red velvet because it was the bartender's fav. It's crazy delicious, blended with real cake and garnished with a mini whoopie pie. . . We tried the ahi sliders and fried pickles. The pickles come as spears. All of this proved to be too much food and I wish I would have known about the to-go cups. . . The next time, I would like to try the Urth Burger-housemade veggie burger.
Ehhh.... it's definitely a unique place with unique menu items that's why I'm even giving 3 stars. The ladies are dressed like hootes girls. A little trashy for the place. . . First off we got the Philly cheese steak egg rolls. Which sound DELICIOUS!!! BUT!  It wasn 15 bucks for 3 rolls with barely any cheesteak inside. It was hard to find any meat. And it was just super fried and bleh. No thanks. . . 5/10. . Next up was the booze shakes!! This was a very clever idea! I like it a lot we got the oreo and bailey's. It tasted amazing. Makes you feel like a fatass but it was very very good!. . 9/10. . Now onto the main attraction. The burrrrgerrr. We got the el machette. My thoughts? No. . Didn't like it  won't eat it again. The bun was cold and that kinda ruined it for the start for me.... I did not love the meat but my girlfriend   did. It wasn't that good. I'm not a huge burger fan but I know when I taste a great burger. This wasn't it unfortunately. . . Well not all bad news! The onion rings are fantastic! Perfectly crispy! They are amazing. Get them with a drink and bounce hahah that's it. They charged an extra dollar for the Chipotle ranch. Il stick regular ranch.  Don't charge us a buck for Chipotle ranch....come on now. Include it  . Well I won't come back! Not a fan.
I must first state that I was a solid 3 on this; however, what happened once we left really soured my mood along with my stomach. . . I must also be clear that this was my first - and subsequently, only - meal of the day. . . First, the food: My trusty companion and I each had a burger. I had the flagship "Gold Standard" and she had the "El Machete". . . The Gold Standard is made with dry aged beef, which is a good choice, and topped with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar and arugula. This should be delicious, and I assume if seasoned properly it is. Unfortunately, there was too much salt seasoning - and believe me... I LOVE SALT - which left the Gold Standard feeling merely Standard. . . My Tardis companion had the "El Machete" which is a spicy aoli and pepper based burger. This was actually delicious from the two bites I had. If there was any seasoning issue with the burger itself it was coveredby the delicious peppers and aoli!. . Along with that we had regular fries and sweet potato fries. The fresh cut fries were tasty, albeit again heavily bathed in salt. The sweet potato fries were on the soggy side but fresh and not overly salted. . . We also had milkshakes. Hers being some fruit compote Fourth of July special concoction and mine being chocolate strawberry. Mine was very sweet but it was strawberry with chocolate sauce, so of course that was unsurprising. (I had asked for chocolate ice cream but I wasn't about to whine about the small oversight.). . As we left, I thought "unspectacular... but worth a second look".  The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I figured that I might try it again when next in town. . . Not long after my companion and I started feeling sour in our stomachs. Come dinner time, still sour... I have slightly upchucked and swallowed it back down on two occasions. Even as I write this, the meal from lunch feels like it is remaining in the upper regions of my stomach and the gassy bloating remains.. . We tried later to force a small meal elsewhere for consistency as it was getting late but we couldn't even touch our food. It literally went into the box the same way it came to the table. . . I really didn't intend on writing a negative review... and many of the reviews are positive. I would like to think this is an isolated incident in which I suspect the culprit to be the milkshakes. . . I really wanted to like this place. The menu is creative.  The decor is attractive. There are a dozen reasons to be drawn to this place.  Unfortunately, I went from "looking forward to eating there" to "pondering a second chance" to "likely not looking forward to a future visit"... . . If not for the promise and potential of my initial thoughts, compared to the way I feel right now, it would have resulted in one star. So in fairness, I decided to average the two opinions. . . All in all a very disappointing visit. Thank god for Pepto.
We visited this place twice during our 4th of July trip . The first experience was great and food tasty so we went back with a friend for dinner . . The service was good but the food was seriously lacking the second time . The bun was dry and almost seemed old . The burger flavor wasn't that great either and the tuna appetizer was almost flavorless not to mention it came on what appeared to be a store bought  tortilla chip .I can say the best part of our meal the second time was the free popcorn ..  I will give them another try next time I'm in town since I'm at a 50/50 with them right now .
I really liked this place. Got a strawberry shake, and it reminded me of Red Robin's shakes which I love. Also, the burgers were delicious and surprisingly not too oily compared to other gourmet burgers. The one thing you have to try is the onion rings. I hate when onions are too large in onion rings, but Holsteins does it right with the thin onion strips and delicious breading.. . My only complaint is the wait time. The first time we went, they told us it was a 30-40 minute wait for our food no matter what we ordered. Food NEVER takes that long to come out even in a steakhouse. We got lucky the second time we went because the waiter told us it was a 30-40 minute wait, noticed we were in a rush, and ended up pulling strings and got our food out in 10 minutes, so kudos to service!
Late night shake craving brought me in. It was a weeknight and was fortunate I found lounge seating to enjoy some dessert after dinner. . . I was pretty full and didn't try the drunken monkey but went for a strawberry shake at around $9.00 - probably due to the great people watching included. The service was a bit on the slower side but my friendly waitress said they only had one gal making shakes and she gets overwhelmed when it backs up - lol.  You wouldn't know it by the taste of this shake, thick and rich tasting and I like the fact that they gave me  the metal  container which was another half shake! So filling but one of the best shakes ever I've encountered. . I'm looking forward to returning and checking out the lamb burger!
finally writing a review after coming here for the 3rd time, defintiely my favorite "gourmet burger" place in vegas . . located on the second floor of cosmopolitan. Wait time usually isn't that bad, but you can make a reservation if you go on a busy weekend just in case. . . They start you off with popcorn thats seasoned with something. . imma just say those alcoholic shakes get me feelin some type of way nuff said, or i was just tired from EDC week . . The first 2 times i was here i got the billionaire burger, foie gras anything i can't really resist. The only bad thing about this burger is it's like double the price of all their other burgers. . The third time i came here i got the. . crispy pork belly bun and that shit sooo good, unless you don't like fat, cus i bit into a fatty ass piece and just about died . . I also got the ahi sliders, they're hella good too, nothing abnormal about them they're exactly what they sound like. even tho ahi mini tostadas would be more appropriate since they come on fried wonton wrappers. . i probably should be talking shit about this restaurant and saying to go to burgr or some other sub par gourmet burger place so i can keep this location to myself, but i guess sharing is caring
If you looking for good burgers, there are so many other options. Bachi Burger is awesome. Also Burger Bar is great too. As for this place, we ordered the billionaire burger for $32. The burger meat was dry and overcooked. The foie gras lacked flavor like they used lower grade to serve with the burger. We also ordered the Pork Belly Bun which was crispy on the outside but was swimming in too much hoisen sauce. Since it was one of my friend's birthday so we decided to order the un-birthday birthday cake. It look greak in the picture but was dense and  flavorless. The best thing was the icing and we scrapped it off and ate that.
Been here twice and it has the best burger I have ever tastes in my entire life. For $18, the Gold Standard is the shiznitobam!
We came here to grab a quick bite to eat. The place is fairly loud because it is across the way from a 24 hour night club. Not a bad thing but you catch a different vibe. We decided to grab an adult shake, to go and settled on the S'Mores. It was wonderful. It was a bit sweet but it is a shake after all. We did not try any of the food; perhaps next time.
We came here on a Saturday afternoon. The wait time was about 40 minutes for a party of 6. I ordered a spicy Bloody Mary and OMG it was so delicious and very spicy!!!!!! I also ordered the steakhouse burger which was also very good. I will definitely come here again the next time I'm in Vegas.
I've eaten here a couple of times. It's 3.5 stars rounded up cause it's in a cool casino. Standard high price for a strip burger, so no whining.. . Service was Meh, atmosphere fun. Teriyaki burger was way too salty for my tastes. Fries were ok, Loaded Ice cream shake delish though. . . I'd definetly rec: Gordon Ramsey's Burger over this place.
Ambience,  food, drinks,  service - 5stars!!!  Burgers are made to perfection! Best pork belly bun evah! They do it the way it should be done! The only thing that we didn't like was the tap water. . But there's beer!!! :)
Adult milk shakes are great. I really thought it was going to be explosive. but it was ok. I was expecting a huge gourmet burger. instead i got a over priced burger with ok fries. The fried pickles are a disappointment. I also had the soft shell crab bruschetta. It was good but could of been way bettter.. . over all it was ok. but the stars are for the lack of burger enthusiasm.
it was okay............probly wont be back.........nothing really stood out
It was ok. I liked the burger I got (nom nom) but I thought Gordon Ramsey's burger place in Planet Hollywood was substantially better. As is Burger Bar in mandalay Bay. You come here really for the way they mix alcohol into their shakes but I just wasn't into the menu, especially with so many other options near-by. Don't think i'd try it again but it was worth a shot.
Second time here and it was delicious!!! The food is filling and everything on the menu is good! You can't go wrong with anything here! I will be back every time I'm in Vegas!
I LOVE THIS PLACE! when I found out that I was going to Vegas the first thing I did was plan lunch here.. Service: great very friendly and attentive . Food: . Lobster truffle Mac N Cheese OMG OMG OMG the best ever it was amazing. Fried Pickles: these were OK but never the less pretty good. Rising Sun: I had this with no teriyakisauce. OMG Amazing . Over all all the food is pretty damn tasty if you are in Vegas be sure to try this place AMAZING
Salmon burger was amazing. Really large portions and everything is tasty. I couldn't get up the nerve to try one of the adult milkshakes (pool party season and all) but they did sound like a great option. . . A little pricey and service was spotty, but ended up going twice in a weekend so it couldn't have been too bad...
Burger for the boys!  How about gourmet burgers?  Even better.  Holstein is located near the East tower elevators in Cosmo.  Right across Marquee nightclub.  . . Many yelpers recommended the "Gold Standard,"  and with that name, I went for it.  After sinking my teeth into the dry aged sirloin burger, a sudden disappointment hit me.  I might've gotten a little too much goat cheese in the first bite, so went for a second bite.  No!  It can't be.  The Gold Standard did not meet my standard for a burger.  Oversalted and didn't go well with the goat cheese.  Yes, I like goat cheese too.  . . It's okay though!! There's crispy pork burns on the table.  My first pork bun was at Ippudo in NYC.  I understood the hype within seconds and ordered a second.  The pork buns from Holsteins didn't let me relive that moment.  There was too much hoisin sauce, which made it overly salty.  Oh, the pork was also dry.  . . Our waiter was actually pretty nice.  However, the service was slow.  The restaurant was full and I saw him constantly filling orders, so I could sympathize.  I usually destroy my burgers and leave nothing but I just couldn't finish my burger and pork buns.  Salt was used very liberally.
Best steamed pork buns and mac & cheese on the strip!  This is a great spot in Vegas and perfect for a not too pricy meal in The Cosmopolitan.  Bartenders do a really nice job and make you feel at home.
Easily one of the best burgers I have ever had. The meat was cooked exactly to my liking; the bun was delicious. Ingredients were fresh. Not bad for about $15. The natural cut fries were really good too. Will eat here again.
As a social being, it is often the case that I throw research and intuition concerning restaurant choices to the wind and go with the "group flow". Often times, this people-before-purpose strategy leads to a mediocre food experience...BUT NOT ALWAYS.. . Sometimes, my first impressions are proven erroneous after relinquishing control and allowing another wanderer(s) to lead the way toward enlightenment. At Holsteins Shakes and Buns, I had one such experience.. . What was enlightenment in this case? Mexican Car Bombs + Creme Brulee Vodka Shakes. . Mexican Car Bomb: A fried Jalapeno bomb filled with a blend of cheeses, corn and black beans. Wrapped with a juicy piece of bacon [strictly for binding purposes -- wink wink].. . Creme Brulee Shake: Tasted just as it sounds. Creme Brulee with vodka in shake form. The brulee came in the form of a crisp sugar stick for finger-style dipping.. . Hosteins Shakes + Buns is the quintessential cosmopolitan experience. Diner fare, elevated and given an urban contemporarytwist.
This place is solid, I'm a huge fan of their Burgers and Shakes.. . Nowadays it's hard to find a place in Vegas that is good without needing to drop $100 per person on a meal. . . Enter Holsteins!. . This place is real good. I got the Rising Sun Burger (Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado). . This was super good! I loved the tempura avocado, such a unique awesome thing to put on a burger!. . I also got the Red Velvet Cake Shake (Zing Red Velvet Vodka, Red Velvet Cake, Cream Cheese Mousse, Mini Whoopee Pie ) which was sooooo good too!. . Highly Recommend, at the top floor of the Cosmo
While I only tried their chocolate milkshake, I know I'll be back.  It's a nice open concept, great music and different seating sections.  Not to mention nice staff too, and not just for their looks.  She offered me glass of water while I waited at the bar.. . A bit of whipped cream, and some crunchy circular chocolate bits.  Wasn't too sweet; only wished they used a thicker straw.. . Just can't wait to I try their burgers b/c had heard they're better than Gordon's.. . Located on 2nd floor @ Cosmopolitan hotel/casino.
To top off a successfull Vegas trip , we came to Holsteins hungry and anxious after seeing all the solid reviews. Located right across the entrance to Marquee, it's an all too familiar location,but unfortunately a location I probably won't return to.. . Upon walking in, we were asked whether we wanted bar or table seating. The hostess literally stated that if we wanted a table, it would mean she would "have to" walk us over. She made it sound like we were causing the biggest inconvenience in the world to her if we didn't sit at the bar. Rude. We still went for a table, and she pointed us to another waitress who would take us. A horrible system.. . It took 10 minutes to have a waiter even greet us after sitting down. Another 35 passed before we became intolerably grumpy and impatient, flagging down our waiter to see what was going on. Two burgers, one of which was rare, should not take 40 minutes to make. After a long day, 5 minutes was very agonizing, and our burgers finally came out.. . - "Meat Ball" Burger ($15): Beef, pork, veal, pecorino & provolone cheese, basil walnut pesto and arugula on herb foccacia roll. The meat concoction was great, but it lacked flavor or marination. Of course, I loved all the cheese, but you could barely taste the walnut pesto. It could use some marinara sauce. Not the best choice here.. . - The Fun-Ghi ($17): Beef patty, truffled marinated portabella mushroom, caramelized onion, gruyere, maro & frisee.  This one was much better and was wonderfully crafted. There was plenty of gruyere, you could taste the truffle oil in the mushroom, and all ingredients balanced well with each other. A superb burger indeed. . . Fries with one burger, onion rings with the other. Both were good quality. The onion rings weren't too deeply fried and maintained a nice crunch.. . - Banana Cream Pie Shake ($13): Bananas, vanilla custard, nilla wafers, caramel, creme de banane, licor 43 and white chocolate covered banana. Absolutely delicious. Although it was technically two servings, a shake should not be worth as much as a burger. Also, there was barely any hint of alcohol in here. Despite this, I sipped it down to the last delicious drop.. . After finishing our meal, it took another 20 minutes to hunt down a different waiter because ours kept ignoring us. The restaurant was less than half full and there was plenty of staff, so service like this is unacceptable. Even the table next to us noted how long our order was taking. . . Overpriced, extremely slow, but quite a treat if you get the right burger.
Extremely attractive burger joint at the Cosmo....but why are these places so noisy? Guess I'm not the youthful demographic these places covet. Nothing wrong with Holsteins. The food and the service are just fine..its just always loud  and seemingly always crowded. My son and I each had the Nom Nom burger...kobe beef with cheddar cheese, potato chips and 1000 island dressing. It was delicious. My wife had the California turkey and gave it a thumbs UP. my daughter had the classic burger and enjoyed it as well. fries come free with big bun burgers like we ordered. prices are what you'd expect from a high end casino. We all enjoyed ourselves..just please turn down the volume!
It's been a little while since I was here, and i had to let my thoughts simmer. . . However, I still remember the burger I had was just absolutely delicious. I had made my way around the strip trying burger places. Gordon Ramsay, Guy Fieri, but this place? This place takes the cake. The Fun-ghi was absolutely to die for. The burger was cooked to perfection. Like always, I get by burgers medium rare. Tasty, juicy, and perfect. And that's just how the burger came out. While I didn't have a shake while I was here, that is in the cards for the next time I'm back.. . I was seated out by their full service bar and a server was with me very shortly. She was polite, had great beer recommendations, and checked in frequently to make sure I was doing alright.. . Out of my Vegas trip this place stood out as one that I intend on making my way back to next time I'm in town.
If you're looking for a delicious, mouth-watering, more-badass-than-fast-food burger, come here. They're just done right. I had the Gold Standard (Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli) and my friend had the Classic (Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Mayo, Ketchup & Pickles). Some other tempting choices on the menu include the Memphis Burger, the Big Fat Greek, and the Fun-Ghi Burger. One friend did try the Turkey Burger and thought it was a tad dry. . . However, I ordered dry aged beef sirloin in a burger form, cooked medium rare, and it was perfect. It was cooked just right, it was high quality beef, it was flavored well, and the aged goat cheddar and arugula was an interesting combination. I couldn't finish the entire burger, but I certainly tried- and I barely touched my fries (which were good, although perhaps a little salty) in order to eat as much of that wonderful burger patty as I could. The sacrifice was worth it. . . While the burgers were fantastic, I also ordered a mixed drink that wasn't great here (we were eating at the bar, so I was a little surprised). And it is extremely loud at night- there was a DJ in the middle of the restaurant, and it was almost impossible to hear each other speak or have a conversation. I was texting with the person I was sitting near because we kept misunderstanding each other or having to get awkwardly close to each others' ears in order to be heard. I'm not sure what time the DJ starts, and it is very likely my faulty for going to get dinner after 10pm in Vegas and expecting anything but a dance club feel :) . . I would definitely come back for a burger, preferably earlier in the day when it doesn't have such a club feel, and I'd order a less complicated drink.
Service was very slow but the food was good. The banana cream pie shake was AMAZING!!!
I thought I had already discovered my burger place in Vegas and that was Gordon Ramsay's BurGR and no one could take that place from my heart.. . Holstein's though, came pretty close. But I think it was my zeal talking more than anything and my weakness for those little moments where a person can feel top of the heap just from buying a meal. . . You see, I had hit it pretty big at roulette and craps the night before and was feeling confident. I knew going in that I wanted that Billionaire Burger, with its truffle aioli and foie gras, elements of a burger I know I would never eat anywhere else but on vacation. I did order it. And then some. That burger came medium rare, with additions of aged goat cheese and lobster, heightening an already indulgent, gluttonous, and decadent burger into a whole other realm. It was luscious.. . But like I said, it wasn't fair. I made it luxurious because I willed it. Is the law of attraction in action? Perhaps. More than likely, though, it was me riding the high of a couple of wins and wanting to eat like a winner.. . The philly cheese steak egg rolls were average. Nothing memorable or special.I also had a taste of the bamboozled shakes, the Tiramisu and the Fat Boy. Most gush about The Fat Boy but it was too candy-like for me. Boyfriend had the Memphis Burger, which had a layer of pulled pork that he believed might have been crisped up on the flattop beforehand to create a crust. I had a bite and was impressed but really, I only tasted it for the sake of tasting because I refused to part with, even lay down, my obscenely excessive truffle, lobster, foie burger, oh no.. . You had better believe I am still thinking about that burger. Late at night, when all the lights are out, I reminisce about the taste of that false luxury.
Yessssss super delicious burgers and onion rings, and affordable-ish for Vegas! Decent prices on a great beer selection. Cool ambiance. Right in front of Marquee, if that's your thing and you want to keep an eye on the line. . . I went twice in one weekend and my favorite was the meatball burger. You need it in your life.
I made love to that gold standard burger like you dad makes love to your mom.
This place is good. I wouldn't say it's the best burger place ever like some reviewers have said, but it was good.. . We ordered the fried pickles which were decent. The insides were lava hot, even after a while of letting them sit to cool. I am pretty sure these are frozen, though. My grandma owns a restaurant and tried out fried pickle spears for the menu and I tried those. Pretty sure these were the exact same ones. . . My husband is a huge burger fan. I don't know if he loves anything more.. He got the golden standard burger that apparently has won a bunch of awards or something (according to our waiter).. When I asked him how he likes it, he just shrugged. I was shocked. He said it was alright, but if we ever ate there again, he would try something else. . . I had the blackened salmon po-boy. It was really good but super awkward to eat because it's a long piece of salmon sitting on a hamburger bun. I had to piece off some of the salmon and eat that separate before diving into the sandwich. Overall, a good choice. The slaw on it was really good. I got sweet potato fries and they tasted just like every other sweet potato fry. Good, but nothing crazy amazing.. . We didn't get a shake because we were outrageously full, which is a disappointment on our part hah.. It's a fun place. Nothing really too bad about it so I'll give it a 4 star. Maybe I'll have to go back with more people in the future to get a better idea of what it's like.
IMO Holsteins is an interesting burger joint. But I've tasted better burgers. I ordered their known and famous burger called Gold Standard. I expected more out of the burger since it was one of the Top Choice/recommended burger since many always ordered it. To be honest, I think In-N-Out would be more satisfying and well worth my money. Spending roughly $18 wasn't worth for what it is. . . I'd rather also go to Bachi Burger. The service here was okay. It took about 10-15 minute wait for my party of 7 to be seated. It was packed inside, but I mean what restaurant in Vegas isn't packed right? Nothing much to complain about them. As far as order whatever else. I'm not sure what else to pick since it's my first time here. I don't think id ever come back and or even crave their burgers. . . I'm not saying you shouldn't come here, but id at least tell you to check it out if you're curious about this restaurant.
If you wanna be a bad boy or girl and have dessert for lunch, sit your bad butt down at Holsteins Shakes and Buns. Located inside of The Cosmopolitan, this is THE place to sip on the greatest boozy milkshake you can find on the strip and probably all of Nevada.. . Based on the Yelp reviews talking about how "HUGE" the milkshakes are, my mom and I arrived at Holsteins with the intentions of sharing a milkshake for a "light" lunch---well, you know... as light as having a milkshake for lunch can be! When our Bailey's infused Oreo milkshake arrived, we both started laughing and ordered another one. Unless you're having a burger and fries with a milkshake, DON'T SHARE. Why?. . A) They're not THAAAAT big. . B) They're too flippin' delicious to share. . . The Oreo milkshake is rich, creamy, and the flavor is about 1600 stories above what you're used to getting from an Oreo milkshake. Even if you get full, you won't want to stop drinking this thing. It's not excessively sweet as some milkshakes can be, so you won't get sick or tired of slurping and sipping the whole thing. I guarantee you that you'll drink both the milkshake they bring you in the fancy glass along with the extra milkshake they bring you in a metal shaker.. . I can't wait to come back for another milkshake some day...
Very good lunch spot in Vegas. They have a decent burger, a good lobster roll and great fries and shakes. I've been here quite a few times over the last couple years and never left disappointed.
Good Kobe beef burger and shake. The sweet potato fries were cold. Service was slow. A little over priced but on a nice hotel.
Usually when I visit a restaurant, I have some apprehension because I'm a vegetarian and usualy my options are limited. I was happy to see that any burger on the menu could be convered to a veggie form. There are dozens of options and customizations to make the burger all your own. It's a hip and trendy place that I would definitely visit again.. . Now on to the shakes. I had a hard time deciding because they all looked so good, but I chose the "Fat Boy," which was amazing. Sweet and salty never tasted so good! The "Urth Burger" was also a good choice, and didn't feel guilty after eating it. . . This is an overall fantastic place to eat.
Classic burger was good, Rising Sun and Gold Standard burger are great!
Our waiter John is fantastic , the food very tasty and the drinks perfect, would definitely come back,5 stars here !!!
Terrible service & over priced food, what more can you expect from a casino burger chic place...? Well, I expected more! I got beef sliders & pork buns as well as the sweet potato fries. I regret to say, out of a $40 bill, my fav item was the 1/2 ramakin of fresh homemade potato chips that came w/the beef...at least they came w/something unlike the pork. Also, for $9 for 2 sliders & no side, u would think they could put some actual meat on there, my pork bun was literally inedible, the meat was 2 big lumps of fat, I had to spit the 1 bite I took out. I have had the shakes on a previous visit...not bad if your into mixing dairy w/your alcohol but these are not the kind of thing most of us would want to finish, honestly. They do offer a full bar though, & have a small selection of specialty drinks. Again, over priced ($12-14 a drink $7 for beers), but not bad, not super creative, just adequate.
First of all, I want to start off by saying that the Cosmopolitan is starting to irritate me. Everything that is the Cosmopolitan is now obnoxious and boring. The types of people the property attracts is just garbage -- the bottom of the barrel. Don't get me wrong. The building and architecture and design of it all is fantastic. LCD screens everywhere, hip little touches here and there make this property great. I just can't stand how un-classically Vegas it is. They try so hard to be different, that in the end of it all, they lose themselves. The addition of Holsteins Shakes and Buns to the property is just the cherry on top. I heard ravenous reviews about Holsteins and I was excited to try this place. Things like, "the best burgers in Vegas," and "I Love Love Love Hoslteins" were some ofmany glowing reviews. Here is my 2 cents.. . The lobster mac and cheese was good, but not great. Surprisingly, the dish had a lot of lobster in it. Unfortunately, the lobster taste was lacking and the texture was not there as well. Lobster usually has a familiarly soft yet firm feeling when you bite it. Theirs was rubbery and lacked flavor. The truffle panko crust on top was nice, but the lack of lobster taste really disappointed me. My favorite part of this dish was the one chip on the side. It consisted of this lobster salad that was full of flavor.. . Upon request, which I thought was complimentary, was popcorn. Though it wasn't your ordinary popcorn, this one was flavored in some weird mixture. I read that it was truffle popcorn. Excited for some truffle infused popcorn, theirs was definitely not so. It was a mixture of a vinegary, buttery flavor that coated the popcorn. This was a weird mix and though not appetizing, I found myself reaching for the popcorn. I ate it, forgot how it tasted like, and then tried it again. The sting from the popcorn seasoning alone was enough for me not to eat it again. I guess my curiosity superseded my palate.. . Quite possibly my favorite food, and naturally, the food I am most knit picking about, the burger is a classic. From the bun to the type of meat, and the almost infinite sauces and toppings you can put on, the burger is a great vessel to work with. With such an iconic item, at a restaurant that supposedly specializes in this stuff, you can't mess it up.. . And now, the Rising Sun burger -- It had Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. Their take on a Japanese burger sounds good on paper. The fried avocado alone would make me happy. It was fried and crispy, and velvety smooth at the same time. I just didn't have enough of it. That probably was the only thing good about this burger. Everything else was a mistake. First of all, what is wrong with this is the Kobe. I hate when restaurants advertise as serving Kobe when we all know most of that is just an American breed, if not, from Australia. Second of all, when you cook a "Kobe" beef burger, it has to be rare. Nothing else will do. What I got was all grey inside. The crust was overly marinated and glazed and turned the meat super dry, and the inside wasn't any different. That is one way to kill an almost perfect burger. The teriyaki glaze was much too overwhelming and the crispy yam didn't help with the cloyingly sweet flavors. Did I order the wrong burger? Maybe, but that still doesn't make up for the overcooked patty.. . If anything, the drunken monkey shake may have been the only thing that was considerably good. It had malted banana gelato and peanut butter crunch. The adult version has Frangelico, a hazelnut liqueur from Italy. I opted out and went with just a regular. "You are in Vegas. Live a little!", you say? In hind sight, maybe I should have made this shake alcoholic. It would have made me feel better about the sub-par meal I just had. Still though, the shake was sweet and the use of gelato made the shave quite delicate and smooth.. . Pretentious, and yet casual, the restaurant has no identity. I just can't associate this restaurant with good food. The same food could be served at a restaurant that looks like, maybe Johnny Rockets, with a lower price, and I still wouldn't think twice about it. I mean, they have red and yellow squeeze bottles for ketchup and mustard. Come on! The food really needs an upgrade. How awesome would it be if finally, the Las Vegas Strip had a go-to burger spot that was hip, and of course, delicious? I think that is a home run and a much needed thing on the strip. I guess I just have to wait a couple years for that to happen. For now at the Cosmo, I guess Secret Pizza will have to do.
Good place for food , the steak burger is wonderful and grilled chicken is 5 star .           .
Having gone to the Cosmo a few times and walking by this place, I had been wanting to try it. I was pretty happy to go there on Saturday with some friends before going bowling, but unfortunately I was just irritated by my experience there and I can honestly say I most likely won't go back. When I got there at 8:45, I put in for a table. The hostess told me it would be 45 minutes. This was fine since I was still waiting for my party to show up. An hour later, I still had not received the text saying a table was available. I walked back up there from the casino floor and see that there are open tables and no line. I approached the hostess (different from the one I spoke to), and she happily says she can get me seated right away. The rest of my party was waiting in line to get in to the parking garage, so I honestly was not in a hurry to be seated. The guy showing me to the table asks why I was getting a table now if the rest of my friends weren't there yet and I said they are trying to park. Then the waiter asks the same thing as well as a busser. It was really irritating. The waiter treated my friend like she was dumb when she asked a question, and seemed overall irritated to being helping our table out. Next time I want a burger, I will be going back to Gordon Ramsay BurGR, or BLT. I was so irritated about this experience, I really have no interest in going back and trying again even though I liked the food. The food was the only thing I liked.
Top 3 burger I've had which isn't even fair because i can't name the other 2... Had the rising sun burger. Incredible. Don't need to write you a book to say how great the burgers are here. Get off yelp and go!
Let me start off by saying that my husband disagrees with me, but, I'm just not that into Holsteins. Sorry.. . Went here Tuesday late July, seated right away, polite and helpful waitress. Ordered mexican car bomb appetizer. Those were blow your face off hot. Light on the cheese, apparently unseeded jalapenos. . . Husband had the steakhouse,  that was okay. I had the gold standard, it was meehh. Daughter had the classic,  it was mediocre.  Baby girl had kids sliders,  no cheese because she's nine years old, wtf? . . The saving grace for Holsteins is the shakes, baby girl and I share the strawberry,  magnificent!  Chocolate shake was also exquisite. . . The problem, one app, two shakes, three burgers, kids sliders,  $123, $150 with tip. Can't do it, sorry. For burgers, I'd rather have In N Out (but their shakes are nasty).
As a vegan, I feel dirty and weird eating at a place called Holstein's. Why do so many themed restaurants (like burger places) think its clever to decorate their restaurant with the same animal they're also selling? That shit creeps me out.. . Anyway, they have a few vegan options here and my sister and I were in desperate need of food. Their "Urth-burger" was actually really good and had all of my favorite toppings - avocado, avocado, avocado.. . Oh and they have an alcoholic veganized milk-shake on the menu. It is damn delicious. . . They also have a DJ playing pretty good tunes as you eat. I dancedto Daft Punk while I stuffed my face.
