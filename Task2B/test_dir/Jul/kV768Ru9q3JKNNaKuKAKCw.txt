Amazing show! My husband and I went for our "date night" on our vacation, away from the group. The stage was incredible how it one minute was a deep pool, then suddenly it was the stage. Performers did great and the clowns are too funny!!!!! . . They take pictures when you walk in so after the show you can get a great souvenir of you and your loved ones. $75 - a little pricey but I thought the moment was worth it.. . Snacks and adult beverages available which was nice!
OMG if you like Cirque, too much O could give you a big O of your own. The stunts are death-defying, the diving is amazing, and the elaborate water-based stunts are just amazing. The tickets are expensive but they're expensive for a very good reason. If you can only see one Cirque show, this is it!
I so often am helped by Yelper reviews. I hope this one will help others not to make my mistake in seeing " O" at Bellagio. I am giving "O" only 1 star because  this is reflective of my experience in a restricted view seat. The show looks fabulous, I hope to see it again, but in a reasonable seat. If you ask at the ticket office,  they may tell you what they told me--that the restricted view seats, priced at $120 each, only block you from some performer entrances and you sit right next to the seats that cost $180 each. This is absolutely not true. My experience suggests to me the center sections are the ones to sit in, whether close to the stage or far. You need to see the entire spectacle. I think its probably a great show but honestly i missed most of it due to the seating. I accept responsibility for taking the risk but, honestly, i think they really should not sell the seat they sold me--at least without being more transparent about how much view is restricted.
Quite simply the best Cirque Du Soleil show and a must see if you like their shows. The set is absolutely amazing as is the performance!
Let's just say I spent $160 on my ticket and it was worth no more than $75 at best.  I was expecting something amazing with how much I spent and instead I wish I would have gone to something else.  The show just has random things going on all over the place and it just didn't seem that miraculous as everyone claims .
Amazing! Definitely worth sitting in the circle- expensive but the show is so entertaining it is worth it.
I went to the 7/18 10pm showing. It started out great and I was very impressed with the swimming acts. However my experience was ruined by the technical difficulties about 3/4 of the show. They made us wait over 20 minutes then told us we would get a refund then turn around and said the issues were resolved. Once the show began again it only lasted another 10 minutes. It felt like an abrupt ending and I guess I'll never know if they skipped out on other acts due to "technical difficulties" they didn't want to tell us. Even though the show was great in the beginning, my experience was ruined overall. I was really bummed because I heard great things about the show but the ending just felt rushed and had too many issues.
Great show overall.. Some things unique to this show (that you probably would not see in traveling shows).. Diving.  This was throughout but they had high diving and then acrobatic diving.. The stage.  Really cool to see how it could change water levels and close quickly.. . Overall, I liked this show more than other Cirque shows because it had only two clown skits (both were funny (or supposed to be funny-I do not find clowns funny) and the story was easier to follow (realizing the story is not that important).. . The trapeze was great.  The only thing missing was those webs of people on the ground balancing on each other.
Great show! We went two days ago and we loved every second of the show it was incredible next time i'll go see another one
Amazing! The best show I have ever seen. My boyfriend and I have now committed to seeing any and every cirque show that we can. They incorporate an entire water show into this one and the entire thing leaves you speechless. It was incredible. The sets are breathtaking and the performers are unbelievable. Definitely a must see!
