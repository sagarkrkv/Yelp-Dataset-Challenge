Another breakfast review.... well I just had too as we found another local joint in Las Vegas which just hits the top notch mark. I found this place while yelping and I'm sure glad we did...  Great customer service, great food and wonderful staff..  a big high five and HUGE thank you to our server Lindsey (hope I spelled your name correctly) as she was amazing first of all as well as everyone else in the place. Treated us like their best friends... the food came out hot and fresh and tasted wonderful. Not to mention those amazing muffins they treated us too for free for being first timers!!  Now THAT is customer service!! Talk about making an instant impression and creating an instant loyal customer... thank you to all of the staff at EGG & I for treating us so well to our visit to Vegas... we will definitely come back to see you again!
Everything was perfect! Banana nut French toast and the eggs Florentine with a side of corned beef hash was all amazing! Carla was very helpful and attentive to our needs!. . My dad came to Vegas years ago on a business trip and while I was on my vacation now he strongly recomended my coming here. Fantastic and great!!
I would easily say that we received the most amazing service from the most incredible server in the world.  I only wished  i lived in Vegas to get the chance to have brunch here at least once/week.  the banana nut muffin was very fresh. The Chocolate chip pumpkin pancakes were perfectly fluffy and pumpkin was fresh, and teh chocolate chips were just right (not too much, not to few).  The Fried chicken skillet was also AMAZING!. Cooked just right, with a thick and creamy gravy, with perfectly cooked potatoes, and an egg, just how i asked for it. even the OJ carafe tasted fresh, and it probably wasn't though, but it had me fooled.. Again the prices, service and quality of food were amazing. (only thing is that this particular Egg&I restaurant was a bit far from our Hotel on the strip, but definitely worth the cab ride). Even the General Manager came by our table  a few times to ask how everything was. (my receipt says the  server is Mandy but i believe her real name was thiereny (shes getting married soon)).. And they have an amazing GIVEAWAY trip to Disney
Whut! This place is simply a friendly local's breakfast dive that is incredibly delicious! And the service is superb! Were were served by Thayrana who is getting married soon and was delightful. She gave us great and honest recos along with some complimentary banana nut muffins with her apologies when our food took a little bit longer than expected. Our most favorite dish was the pumpkin pancakes with chocolate chips! Highly recommend this place to all and apparently they have several locales as well!
Having read the reviews on Yelp, I just had to see for myself what all the fuss was about. Well, I'm a big breakfast guy, and this place more than lived up to its reputation. I went with the country fried steak, which had the perfect combination of crispy and tender. I'm more of a hash brown fan, but their cubed breakfast potatoes were very tasty. And I have to pay tribute to the banana nut muffin; I don't even like bananas, but this was fantastic. To top it all off, my server Staci was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Highly recommended.
Great food! Homemade style, fresh, flavorful. Loved the mashed potato omelet, hash browns, and banana nut muffin. Big portions and fair price. Fast service.
Great food; I got the classic and added avocado to the toast! Fast service and everything was tasty and our server Carole Ann was AWESOME!!! :)
Wonderful place to get breakfast!  Bree, our server, was attentive and friendly.  She had great suggestions on the menu and was always refilling drinks and making sure we were satisfied.  The stuffed French toast and works skillet were awesome!!
Went to breakfast this morning and everything was fantastic.  I had the Brads scramble and my husband had an omelette with mashed potatoes and bacon.  They were both AMAZING.  The coffee was good and the server was friendly and engaging.  We couldn't have asked for anything more.
Awesome place!!  We were undecided between the Egg & I and another place we saw on Yelp with great reviews.  We'd gotten rid of our rental car the day before so we'd have to take a taxi to either.  At the spur of the moment, we picked the Egg & I.  Yay for us for picking an awesome joint.  We waited only about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Once seated, we flipped through the newspaper menu.  I'd read so much about the muffins, we ordered a couple to start our meal.  They were banana nut muffins.  We both ate the entire thing.  So good.  And with a great cup of coffee, we could've stopped right there.  But we didn't!  Since breakfast is not my favorite meal, I love it when I find a place that has lunch style breakfast.  There were so many options I had to choose from.  I was stuck between the stuffed pepper and the Tacos Rancheros.  I chose the Tacos Rancheros.  It was a tortilla topped with refried beans, ground hamburger, two eggs (which I got fried) and topped with cheese and sour cream.  I would've liked some salsa with it but it didn't need it.  My partner got the garlic mashed potato omelet.  It was enormous.  She could only eat half of it to which our server, Karla suggested getting the half order next time!  Shoot, we didn't know you could do a half order.  But, my partner said she wouldn't gotten a half anyway because the portions would be all wrong.  We both loved the Old Bay seasoned fried potatoes.  As we waddled out, it was great that the front desk called a cab for us.  Very nice.  Oh, and there's a little egg face on the table that you can flip revealing a sad egg face if you happen to need anything.  That's a brilliant idea!  Karla was awesome and if we lived in the area, it would be our go to place!
The Egg & I has got to be the best breakfast dining experience I've had in Vegas. The place is busy because the food is excellent for a really good price and the service is very good.. . Food:. 1) Banana Nut Muffin was the best I've ever tried so far. You could tell they used a lot of butter because it was so soft and flavorful!. 2) Benedict - The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was amazing. Perfect execution of this dish.. 3) Ranch potatoes were FANTASTIC. They were seasoned perfectly and not overly salty. They didn't have that heavy, thick potato texture. It was lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.. . Service: The hostesses knew how to handle the influx of people waiting and the servers were friendly, helpful, and very efficient. We even got water refills without even having to ask.
By far THE BEST BREAKFAST PLACE so far in my life! Very simple & great service! The waffles w fresh fruit was phenomenal & biscuits & gravy - don't get me started! I don't know why this place isn't 5-stars on Yelp! It's probably because of losers or snobs who just want to make a statement. If I could I would give it 6-stars!!   I've been to breakfast places all over the country and this place is THE BEST!  "Johnathan" was awesome!!! Hope I'll see him in Disneyland! Cheers to the owners of this place, they know breakfast! :)
My husband is a big Vegas aficionado but I resist sin city as much as the religious right. But alas we had to attend am event so we came together and he's been trying to show me the other side of Vegas.  So far a success. And a key contributor? The Egg and I. . . Lianora seated us within 5 minutes despite large crowds - very efficient! Kelsey and Gia were most attentive servers. Even sending us on the road with some muffins and butter. Along with some non gaming locals only recommendations. . . And the food... Enough has been said about the egg dishes. But someone please try the buckwheat pancakes! With cashews and fresh blueberries. And REAL mar syrup. . . I'm just saying.
Wow, what a great meal. I had the spinach Benny and shared a short stack of pumpkin pancakes (not on the menu). OMG the pancakes were out of this world. This place is definitely our new stop before we head home!
Thank you Karla for the amazing service, awesome attitude, and great food. For a party of 13 you rocked it! Get the steak & eggs!
First time here, amazingly fast service (we were in a rush, too), server Kelcey was awesome, highly recommend to everyone!
The Egg and I is truly the BEST BREAKFAST in Las Vegas ! !  Food is HELLA GOOD and the wait staff, especially our server Kelcey, were very attentive.  The restraunt was very busy as it was Sunday mid-morning, but they were very speedy without rushing people to get out. The Chile Rellano omellet was delicious !  I'm going back again tomorrow ! !
The food was simply delicious. Service was impeccable. This is one of the best breakfast places I have ever been to.  The banana nut muffin was everything.  I can't wait to come back on my next visit to Vegas.
This is probably one of the best breakfasts out I've had in recent times. Everything's was good and fresh. One of the best things was the banana bread/muffin. I had the pumpkin pancakes (which are not on the menu, so ask) which were so delicious that I didn't even need syrup. . . My wife, who I love so much (just in case she reads this), is a finicky eater, and she wanted to come back the next day before we left (which we did). She got the skillet breakfast both times. Word to the wise, get a half order if you're not a big eater.. . One last thing, went with friends so I tried the biscuit and gravy, stuffed french toast and two different skillet breakfasts. I would have been happy with any of these other orders. . . Ok, I lied, this is the last thing, try the Habla Diablo verde on your food, it is very tasty. So much so, we bought a bottle to take with us.
Carol Ann our server was very attentive ,  great service  overall.  All servers helps each other.  I love the EGG Alert on the table to notify your server or other staff that you are in need of attention.  I enjoy the perk of flavored non dairy cream as well.. . We are comprised of 2 adults and 2 children.  2 finicky eaters who enjoyed their food thoroughly.  Both my husband and I are major breakfast people and we enjoyed the very rich Benny traditional breakfast and Chille Relleno breakfast meal.  . . The Hollandaise sauce is yolk concentrate hollandaise but had good medium consistency.  Still light enough but not whipped light like that of Martha's in Hermosa Beach. For those of you who don't like your egg benedict to be submerged in hollandaise, ask for it hollandaise on the side so that the english muffin retains its texture and is not falling apart.  . . The Banana muffin is well balanced and subtle and moist when serve warm. My children usually don't like banana muffin but they consumed it pretty fast this time.  . . The chille Relleno was good and cheesy and I love the cilantro playing against the cheese and chile powder and the hollandaise sauce.  Perhap slightly more cilantro would be for those who like cilantro.. . My daughter 9 year old got the french toast with Strawberry.  It was good and moist too.  The only thing I noticed was that it didn't come with raisin as it had stated in the menu.  . . The ambiance was great. Casual, no pretense, just down right warm and friendly.. . Our wait around 11:40 ended up being only 15 minutes which was great. . . Thank you all "Egg and I" staffs  for a wonderful experience and a wonderful breakfast meal!
Found this place on yelp. I read a few three stars that didn't like the upsell. I found it was very polite and good value. I got a wash and wax for $50. All the staff were friendly, they work hard and don't take short-cuts. Whole wash took maybe an hour with no idle time. Great results, no missed spots, will come again. I wish Irvine had a place like this.
This place is usually busy, but the wait isn't to bad.  They have indoor and outdoor seating.  . . The service is great, the wait staff is friendly and they use an egg flip system on your table to help with the service.  If you don't need help, the egg shows a smile.  If you do need assistance, flip the egg and it shows a sad yellow egg to alert your server.  . . They know how to cook eggs here!  It's hard to find a place that knows how to do a proper soft scramble and Egg & I does it right.  They have a great fresh fruit waffle and their crepes are really good.  They also have a Hawaiian menu with Loco Moco, Portugese sausage, spam, eggs and rice (the real sticky kine) and Aloha shoyu!  . . Tip:  try the banana nut bread...ono!
Great place for breakfast or lunch. Even when crowded, the wait is never too long. The food is really good and the wait staff are always very attentive and food arrives promptly. We feel that it can be a little pricey, so not a real bargain, but consistently good.
Our favorite place to stop for breakfast when we make the trip from L.A. to Vegas!  Always delicious and consistent! The Egg and I never disappoints and Our Server, Alyssa was awesome! She was very friendly and was quick!! I think everyone should take the trip off the strip for some French Toast Banana Bread!!
Got to vegas frm san diego this is the first place we came to eat...the place is clean and easy to find..the menu was wonderful..a plus for me was that there was rice...the price were good and the portions were big...are waitress karla was wonderful and very nice started are day off positive....will tell othe
Best breakfast in Lad Vegas! Service is fantastic; Erin was the best. Thank you Erin for male our breakfast a great experience.
food was good service was uh-may-zing!...30 people and fast friendly and efficient service. stacie rocks!. . oh yeah they got loco moco and portuguese sausage island style!
My fiance and I stayed in Vegas for the weekend and we wanted an awesome breakfast not in the hotel. We yelped this place and it had 4 1/2 stars so we tried it. It was packed! 15 minute wait but we sat outside. Awesome food! Would definitely come again!
Looking for a simple and amazing breakfast to brighten up your day? . . This place is it. . . Great food, huge breakfast selections, great service, and reasonable price.. . The staff told us the wait to sit inside was approximately 30 min to 45 min, but our group could get a table now if we decided to sit outside. So we decided to sit outside on the patio and the weather wasn't too bad for a nice weekend breakfast.. . Skillet breakfast - works (ham, bacon, sausage, mushrooms, onions, peppers, and tomatoes - $10.75 w/ banana nut muffin): One of the best banana nut muffin that you will find and very flavorful potatoes. The portion was enough to fill my tummy up!. . It's egg-ceptionally good! And don't forget about the banana nut muffin! . . P.S. - Once you are finished with the meal, you will have to pay at the register.
A decent,  not great, breakfast experience in a market  hurting for a good breakfast restaurant. Few truly healthy options here. Too busy for really good service. Prices are very good. Beware the at their sausage patties are rather flavorless,  pre-fab frozen breakfast sandwich patties.. . I had the vegi-benny breakfast with their breakfast potatos, ie deep fried potato nuggets. The Benny was very good. Their cinnamon roll was very good. Not 5 stats for having to wait way too long for coffee and for few healthy options. A last note about all the televisions they have mounted on the walls. We enjoyed watching COPS while dining. Really guys? . . The fact that this place has long waits on weekends goes to show that Las Vegas needs better because even this greasy spoon with a homecooked image gets slammed.
There are many breakfast-themed places in town, we were in the area and decided to try this place. Place was full but no wait on a Saturday for 2 adults, a toddler and an infant. We had the Banana Bread French Toast which was good, but had similar texture to the Banana Nut Muffin that came with it (should have gotten some other side dish). But don't get me wrong, both we're good. The muffin was served fresh from oven with steam coming out as you break it. We also got the avocado omelet with cheese and sour cream. This was good but what we really loved were the side of potatoes. Just the right amount of seasoning to keep you interested. Overall very good experience. Service was excellent.
we yelped to find the egg and I while staying in Vegas. So glad we did . This place is so yummy. Nice warmbanana bread muffins. Great variety of food choices for breakfast and lunch. Our family of 6 all got different items and we all loved each of our selections . I don't think you can go wrong with anything you choose. We received wonderful service from our waitress STACI. She was on top of refills and making sure we liked what we ordered. . I would go back again just because STACI's service was great. I would request her every time we go back. Definitely should try this place if you haven't already .
We discovered this gem of a restaurant and was pleasantly surprised.  The menu is amazing.  I had the eggs and chilli relleno which was amazing.   Erin our waitress was incredible and provided us the most friendly pleasant service.  All the way around the experience was awesome.  I can't wait to go back.
Everything's awesome. I had Mexican omelette. Potato works and fries are spicy. Dont't forget to try their delicious Banana muffin rocks...
Food was delicious!! Portions were huge, could have easily shared one plate! I had the stuffed French toast which is basically an omelette between two large pieces of French toast, yummy. The potatoes were crunchy, the only way to have breakfast potatoes.. The banana but muffin was heaven on a plate, a must try for sure.. Amanda was our server and she was not only efficient but friendly and made our visit perfect! We will be back and hope she is there when we are.
I'll be honest this last visit to Vegas blew like a hot, lung collapsing desert breeze in your face while taking a whiz off the side of Zzyyxx Road. Between the bitch slaps I endured from Willy Wonka, Frodo Baggins, and those hags from Sex and the City I had enough and wanted to back flip off the Stratosphere without a bungee cord. Instead of eating more diarrhea inducing gobbledygook at the Caesar's food court my wife dragged my sluggish brown behind to the Egg and I. Thank God she did. Sorry no dancing ghetto looking dancing Despicable Me minions or card slappin' faux-porn peddlin' hombres here. What you will get though are those amazing banana nut muffins. The spinach benny I had was my saving grace, I doused it in hot sauce and devoured it Melissa McCarthy style. The waitress gives you your own container of coffee to refill your own mug instead of having to wait for her to come back. Jesus H. who does that anymore!!?? It's such a simple but awesome concept! Not these little doggy doo doo Denny's around where I live in the barrio, that's for sure.
Great food and great service! Carol Anne was awesome! This is a must if you're ever at Lea Vegas! Best Banana But bread I've bet tasted. Great skillets too. But their best one is the BANANA NUT BREAD FRENCH TOAST!!!!! You won't be disappointed!
Had time for breakfast before leaving Vegas and decided to give this place a try!. . The food alone I would rate a 4 but the overall experience was easily a 5.. . We had the beef hash, eggs Benedict florentine, New York steak, and veggie omelette.. Nothing really to note on each item, all were satisfying and enough to fill us up.. . We were seated immediately upon arrival.. Our waitress took our drink orders and came back quickly to take the rest.. . Food was prompt and I was asked right before the food was brought out if I would like Tabasco or any other sauces with my food. I did.. . Oh. And they gave us an extra banana nut muffin because only 3 of our meals came with one. (Party of 4). . Great experience! Will return
I love eggs. I love egg jokes. And I also love a great Eggs Benedict. . . They delivered! I ordered the Florentine out of desire for something a little more healthy. The food was great as expected, but the food alone didn't make the experience! . . Our waitress was amazing. She anticipated our needs before we even noticed something was missing (sauces even before the food came out), and even offered me a free muffin because the rest of the party had received one with their meals whereas I had not. (The banana nut muffin is amazing) . . I left feeling eggcellent!
This is one of my regular stops for breakfast. Normally a great breakfast joint but not today. The greeter wasn't friendly and the food was average. This place has been around for a long time with a good reputation. The kitchen needs to try harder and they need a friendly, happy greeter. It will be a while before I go back.
Great, great, great! I had Waffle Works. Crispy, light, tasty. Served perfectly by happy, smiling Stacie. . Will be back for sure.
This place is wonderful. Our server Stacie was so sweet and cheery. How can you not smile in a place called Egg & I anyway?  Hint...come up with some "eggciting" comebacks. So much fun. Our Vegas trip was topped off with this place. Will be back!
The best breakfast i ever had.. U need to wait to get in there. Worth wait.. . Any Omelet here is awesome wit. Sides Cajun fries or french fries.. Fruits on the side.. . We ordered 7 different omelets. Each and every person have their own specifications. All our orders are perfect. The waiter's here are pretty cool. If i stayed back in vegas and longer i would eat my Breakfast only here.. . They offered us the Banana Muffins after our meal. Thats really awesome. We couldn't eat them so they gave us ToGo.
Found this place driving through to Utah. We had a party of 17 and everyone loved their breakfast. The food and service were awesome. This will be our new go to breakfast spot while in Vegas
