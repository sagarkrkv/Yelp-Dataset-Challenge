A true 5 star resort with amazing amenities. The suite was huge and the resort fee covered the gym and internet. Lots of dining options and great service at the concierge and all throughout. Encore is connected to Wynn so you get the best of both casinos. Rooms were super clean and very modern and new. Awesome experience!
The Vegas club was booming all night. My family did not get any sleep even though we stayed on the 27th floor. It was not a pleasant experience. We will not be coming back.
I treated myself to a few nights here in the middle of a long trip to Vegas and I was not disappointed. The rooms were absolutely stunning, as were the views. The pools are nice, as well with there never being a shortage of waitresses to take your drinks order (which is an important detail). It is also surprisingly reasonably priced for such a beautiful hotel. I will definitely be staying there again!
Beautiful hotel. Room spotless. Comfy bed. Clean bathrooms. Slept with curtains open was awesome. Asked for fridge and got it complementary. Pool water was warm though. In 113 degree weather. Lovely hotel. Flowers, butterfly's and romantic red everywhere. Stay here!!!
The bathroom had a moldy smell, and it came from the shower stall. It was so poorly designed, there is no room for moisture to escape. The glasses come up to the ceiling and there is no vent directly over it, so it created the perfect environment for molds. The cleaning was not done well either... soap scums in the area where you can't see directly.. One good thing was their service for baby crib and separate fridge for milk storage.. Very disappointed with the bathroom - won't stay there again.
Stayed here on a recent trip and it was solid as to be expected. Great service and the rooms are always nice.
Very nice rooms.  Good service.  A bit far from other hotels and the crowd is a bit older.
Fantastic hotel complex - I stayed at the Encore but also spent some time at the Wynn as well. First of all, the decor and layout of both of these hotels is inviting and very open. If I ever went back to Vegas this would likely be the only hotel I consider for one specific reason - while many other hotels along the strip are beautiful and well decorated, this one is the only that does not seem overly packed with tourists who are taking pictures and/or finding their way around. Of coarse, I'm a tourist too, but this hotel feels like vacation.. . The pools at both Encore and Wynn are beautiful. The service in the cafes and restaurants is great. We splurged a little bit and had a nice dinner at the Country Club. If you're thinking of it - do it! It's not only romantic, the food and wine are amazing.. . Lastly - the actual rooms in the hotel (I can only speak for Encore) are exactly what they look like in the pictures. The suites are huge, clean, and beautiful. I've never stayed anywhere else in Vegas - but this is by far the best hotel I've stayed in. If you book in advance, it's also reasonably priced.
I gotta give Steve Wynn his props.  Golden Nugget, Mirage, Bellagio, Wynn, Encore.  He built each of those properties, and each of them raised the bar in Vegas.  . . Like it's sister property (The Wynn), Encore is a very nice, easy place to stay in Vegas.  The accommodations and service are top notch, and it's a beautiful, easy to navigate property.  I can't say which of the two properties I prefer, and it's a little tough to describe how the two properties differ from one another even through they are far from identical to one another.  I would say Encore has a more sedate feel to it overall. My sense is it does not get as many people wandering in from Las Vegas Boulevard as the Wynn.   . . Although, like the Wynn, the Encore is a thoroughly modern Vegas hotel, it retains a lot of old Vegas feel to it in terms of scale and service.  Genuinely great service used to be a given in Vegas almost anywhere you went, but it's become increasingly rare.  I miss the old Vegas a lot, and the Wynn reminds me of the old Vegas even if it doesn't really look like the old Vegas.  . . Our room was perhaps the nicest room we've stayed in in Vegas.  It was effectively a junior suite with a good sized sitting area adjacent to the bedroom area.  This room seemed larger than it's equivalent at the Wynn, but it might just be a different layout that seems larger.  . . There are three nice sized pools on the property.  Two are for hotel guests only, and are about what you would expect for a luxury hotel in Vegas, which is to say they are very nice.  The third pool, Encore Beach Club, is open to anyone 21 and up willing to pay the entrance fee.  Think Rehab, Ditch Fridays, etc.  I think building a dedicated day club pool is a great idea.  It eliminates what would otherwise be an annoyance to guests who aren't down with the Bro's and Ho's pool scene (pretty much anyone over the age 30).  . . Parking is a breeze unlike many Vegas properties.  The parking structure is easy to get in and out of and easy to park i, and the walk from the parking structure to the casino is basically nothing.  . . If it's gambling, high end shopping, dinning, or nightlife you're after, Mr. Wynn's got you and your $$$$ covered sun up to sun up, basically, when you consider the late night club scene.  . . One gripe:  When the pools close at 7:00, the staff could have been a little more diplomatic when telling people they must leave the "regular" pool area.  After three loudspeaker announcements, no one needs to be barked at while whey are leaving.  Don't treat hotel guests the same way I imagine you treat some of the Beach Club clientele, mkay?  On a separate occasion, when my buddy was near the Beach Club, which you walk past to get to Las Vegas Boulevard,  a staffer asked him curtly, "can I help you?," when his tone suggested he really meant, "what are you doing here?" I would have replied, "Yes, a cold bottle of water would be nice, thank you."  . . Notwithstanding the somewhat less than diplomatic approach to closing the pool, I doubt anyone would be disappointed staying at Encore. . . Bonus:  Tacos El Gordo is a short walk up the boulevard away.  The spicy pork tacos there are spectacular and worth the short walk up the boulevard to an admittedly somewhat rough around the edges shopping center in the shadow of Encore to get them.  The vast majority of the denizens of Encore will never make that walk and will never know what they are missing.
No stars. Clubs security's and promoters are all very disrespectful. Had multiple problems with encore beach club and XS night swim.
We just came back from staying at the Encore for two nights and overall, it was really great.  The five star review comes with a caveat -- we stayed mid-week in the middle of the summer, so our king suite was just $200 a night -- a steal that must be done. *** Without the suite, my review would drop down to a 4.. Why 5-star?. 1. The service is top-notch and we didn't have even to glance up to have people swarming us every second to ask if we needed anything. Check-in and check-out took five minutes.. 2. The decor and layout are amazing. I'm not a fan of Jeff Koons but there was plenty of other art and cool stuff to look at (fountains, waterfalls, carousel -- even the carpet is pretty cool!) as you waltz through both the Encore and the Wynn, which are connected, and the adjoining high-end stores (Alexander McQueen, Louis Vuitton, Graff, etc.) that connect the two hotels.  It was fun to window shop!  . 3. The room was just perfect: the Dream bed lives up to its reputation and now we're saving money to purchase this bed for ourselves so we can have this experience every night. We were on the 59th floor (definitely opt for a high floor if you can) and the sweeping views from the floor to ceiling windows kept us entertained at all hours.  The mini-bar was *fully* stocked (including a "pleasure pack* -- yes!) but there was no coffee machine (understandably -- a waste of space - who drinks that stuff any more?). The wi-fi was pretty good, but not perfect.. 4. The luxury here is the newness of the facility, the cleanliness (spotless mostly) and the amenities that are available. . 5. The pool is lovely and a much needed respite from the 106-degree heat. Definitely get there early to score chairs in the shade. They provide towels, ice water (yes!!) and while we were there, we got free grapes and bottled water.  If you're feeling spendy, there are killer cabanas available that surround the pool, where you have lounges set up and cool water sprayed into the cabana -- nice....also, you can reserve umbrellas and chairs inside the pool.. 6. The casino was fun and not too smoky (compared to other hotels we went to) - we even won a little, so that was cool.  One of the slots I had let me play poker for 15 minutes on a dollar.. 7. This is not a "family-oriented" resort (thank you!!), but rather a playground for adults. The restaurants clearly state that children under 5 are not allowed in the dining room.  For some reason, a lot of today's parents do not understand that children under five should NOT be allowed in a fine dining establishment, so this rule was MUCH appreciated.  As a result, there were no screaming kids anywhere in the resort. Excellent!. . All this comfort costs money, so take some moulah!  Drinks inside were $12 each, at the pool - $15.  Double lattes + bagel + muffin = $25. Just a heads up!  Mostly, food was pretty good, although expensive for what you get. Our lunch at society cafe was good, but not great (my turkey "pastrami" sandwich was kind of gross even though the waitress had recommended it) but the best part was when the chef came out to discuss my husband's tree nut allergy (wow! didn't expect that) and we went to the Buffet for breakfast (all-you-can-eat - two of us - about $50) and the corn pancakes were ice cold and inedible, even though we arrived when the Buffet opened. I know...strange, but there it is.. . ***Part of the luxury besides the deal on the room mid-week was that it was not very crowded when we were there. Friday, it started to get a bit crowded, so I highly recommend staying during the week.. . Would I stay here again?  Yes, provided we stay in a king suite. ;)
The Wynn Encore is my new favorite hotel while in Las Vegas. Recently I accompanied my boyfriend on a trip over the weekend and we opted for the Encore over The Wynn to try it out. The rate for a weekend at this amazing place was very good. They do have a rate guarantee if you book on the Wynn site, FYI. That includes an upgrade, and a price match. On check in, we had a bit of a line at the check in desk. But the staff was more than apologetic and kind to us on check in. We had booked a suite and it was upgraded to a panoramic view suite. I had just had surgery on my spine earlier that week and the check in girl offered to send up a refrigerator for my ice packs needed for my recovery. I know, spine surgery recovery in Vegas ??? Well, a suite at The Wynn Encore makes it a perfect place. It's truly a 5 star experience. The rooms in Vegas on a weekend can be noise intrusive from the halls. This room is sound proof; the only exception is our room was 39 floors up and we could hear the Deadmau5 party below both weekend nights bumping until about 0500am; I only know because I was up to medicate myself! The room was a spacious suite; two separate rooms and a bathroom suite with soaking tub and separate water closet. Little touches like touch control shades , drapes, night lights that dimly light the hall and bath area for night and EVEN the 'do not disturb' or 'make up room' are done via touch control. We ordered room service on our Saturday here; my love wanted a Wynn Signature Bloody Mary; no alcohol allowed for me, so I wanted a nonfat cappuccino service. The room service attendant, Diane, arrived about 30 minutes later , ( it's a huge hotel and I imagine room service in Vegas on a weekend is slammed), and had my steamed, frothed milk and espresso in separate canisters to keep hot. His Bloody Mary was hand shaken and mixed by Diane. She was friendly and on top of her game. Steve Wynn must appreciate his guests to make sure his staff is that attentive to the needs of the guest . We tried to add an extra tip to her check and she said , 'No! It's all inclusive in your bill'; that's never heard of. We dined at a few of the restaurants on Wynn/Encore property. One thing to remember: this is a 5star property to 'compete' with 'the best of the strip' , The Venetian; The Bellagio. You are gonna shell out some dollars by being here. The 2$ restaurant will run you close to $100 and the drinks in the lobby bar average $14 plus. It's not for coming to Las Vegas on a budget. If that's your thing , stay at a lower rated property. Everything here is beautiful; floral everywhere; high end shopping , like Fendi and Dior!!! I die! Great people watching from most places that are public : our place for my boo to have a night cap was the Lobby Bar. The typical club pretty's all shiny and drunk are fun to watch going to and from the clubs on property! Yes. Even The Wynn has drunk girls and guys and that's always fun entertainment; it's even better because I could not drink this time! The pool was wall to wall and closes early, in my opinion, to set up for the clubbing crowd. One pool staying open for adults would not be a bad idea. The staff manning the pool were also on their game, attentive and nice. Another note, not many children. Sorry. We like that. Our travel mates were down the strip further at a popular hotel, and the children running around the pool and common areas was beyond annoying; kids in Vegas???? Return factor , MINUS a surgery recovery, all in:-) I love this place .. More than The Venetian and more than The Bellagio. Next time I will stay a bit longer ; enjoy the spa and more of the food when I feel 100%.
I stayed at Encore last weekend and it is a beautiful hotel. I had an awesome suite on a top floor for the weekend and the staff was great and attentive.  The rooms are beautiful. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars because I felt that the crowd is definitely more "mature". and I was disappointed with food options. Younger people come for Encore beach Club but generally speaking the clientele is much older. . . Also drinks were ridiculously expensive. My average drink was $18-$20 dollars. Food selection was ok - both on site and room service. I had room service for breakfast the first morning and I was very unimpressed. Eggs Benedict was $32 and when it arrived, it was definitely lacking in portion size and taste. Mind you when you've been drinking all day or plan to drink all day -- food is critical! I just opted for a bottle of champagne instead :)  The restaurants were nice, food wasn't spectacular.  . . I did enjoy the pool area, but it was mostly couples and older folk. The EBC pool on the other hand was a blast, as always! They had a nice give away with free bikinis and temporary tattoos. Actually, I would like to give a shout out to the guys who work at XS, EBC and Surrender, very nice and accommodating. Stellar service there. . . The gambling is  expensive ($25 minimum tables) with not so many tables. I'm not an experienced gambler and I was hoping to try it out, but this is definitely not the place to learn. . . Would I stay here again? Maybe. Nice spacious rooms, good views, but small compared to most other hotels.  Service is great.  4.5 stars would be more accurate.. . Editing this review from 4 stars to 5: Went back to Encore the following weekend for a bachelorette party and the food at Botero was literally out of this world. YUM.
Wow. . . The Encore is stunningly beautiful.  So glad we ended up staying here.  From the moment we checked in, with a very helpful and friendly registration staff (who apologizes and thanks every guest for being patient as almost every hotel in Vegas takes forever to check in) to the next morning when we left - our stay was enjoyable.  . . Rooms: Huge. Modern. Beds: Comfortable. Tech: iPod docks.  Light, privacy and curtain control bedside, as well as by front door.. Bathrooms: TV in mirror.  Spacious.  Tub and shower stall.  No jacuzzi tub though.. Pool:  Two of them.  One adult "european style" that allows topless bathing for women, which has a swim up bar.  Another closer to the main hotel with lounge chairs partly submerged in the pool.  Beautiful gardens area surrounding the pool, too. . Casino: Easy to make your way around and not a crazy confusing maze like most other Vegas hotels.. Bar casino-side - Eastside Lounge:  Live music nightly wed-sat, expensive, but great drinks.  If you get a table, 2 drink minimum.  No food served.  Ray makes an amazing Milagro Margarita (it'll set you back $15).  . . One downside: . As most casinos allow smoking, this is no exception.  Unfortunately, there are not smoking areas here, and rather patrons can basically smoke anywhere.  Which leaves you smelling like smoke and basically the whole casino floor can be smoky.  Not fun. . . Otherwise, a great experience and would absolutely come back soon.
The most elegant hotel/casino in all of Las Vegas! Wynn is awesome and Encore is even nicer. It's quieter and more posh, with amazing red chandeliers throughout the casino. . With XS nightclub and Encore Beach Club, this place caters to the kids with money too. Rooms are second to none! Book here if you want the finest experience.
One of the best hotels I have ever stayed. The rooms were elegant, spacious, clean and very comfortable. I would definitely come back.
What can I say, no one measures up to Steve Wynn when it comes to luxury hotels and casino. This is the place to stay in vegas and I've stayed in most of the best!. . Food.   Exquisite. . Beach club.  No comparisons. . Hotel. Nice. Casino. Big money. . . I highly recommend it.
