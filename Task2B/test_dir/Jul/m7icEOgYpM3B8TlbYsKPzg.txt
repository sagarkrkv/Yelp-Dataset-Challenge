I felt different emotions while I was watching this show - it was exciting, funny, beautiful, unusual, touching! All at the same time. That is why I highly recommend this show, especially for couples. I would love to see it one more time with pleasure! Wonderful!
I really thought that was a vulgar show and I'm a 29 year old guy! I felt uncomfortable most of the time, and the acrobatics were not even that good. And the jokes....REALLY lame. And that Nene from Housewives of Atlanta was there...what a LOSER! Her jokes were TERRIBLE. Wish I could have my 170 bucks back, and my waste of time in Vegas.
I dislike Las Vegas. . . Let me count the ways. It is in a desert, using water, excessively wastefully. It is a huge gratuitous consumer of electricity. It is anything but sustainable and local for its gluttonous food offerings. You will encounter many depressed people. It maintains a 24 hour day for night environment outside the diurnal cycle. The synthetic and theatrical architectural themes are offensively non-authentic. . . So I created a strategy. Travel by monoral, or when renting a car, stay outside of town, like in Boulder. Visit the natural areas like climbing at Red Rock. Do not set foot on the sidewalks of the Strip. Walk through "unsavory" areas where real people live. . . And see a Cirque show.. . If you are in the creative community, nothing in this show will be shocking. But its beauty, for the show I attended, was for the MC to invite a very elderly couple in the audience onto the stage to dance together in the finale. . . That's what it's all about. . . Love.
The comedy bits were absolutely hilarious! I was laughing out loud. The performances were extremely sexy and the acrobats were beautiful and talented. . . Definitely a Cirque show to be seen with a date. Do not see with mom and dad.. . I saw it twice and it was just as funny and enjoyable the second time!
Great show! Everyone did an amazing job. I found it hilarious.. . Friendly warning to audience: if you have strong opinions on sexuality and feel the need to express them. Please go watch something else. . . The couple sitting behind me were so inappropriate when they saw the two male performers kiss multiple time. Their comment "that's just wrong". Kinda put a dagger to my entire evening.
This show is not like the other Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas. It was entertaining and did have some of the acrobatics like the other shows. However, when you come to this show you should come with an open mind! The show revolves around sex and although most of it is done very tastefully, there were some parts that were a little "over the top" you could say... Don't sit in the front unless you want to be pulled up on stage!!! We definitely had a great time but will check out other shows in the future!!!
First cirque Du Soleil show we been too and we were very pleased.. This is an Adult show so dont go with someone that you would be uncomfortable with..  went with hubby made for a nice evening!
I would go see this again and again, very funny and over all a really good show! This show while it is intended for adults Is not without a taste of class.
This was my second time seeing Zumanity. I talked it up to friends who were reluctant. So I was embarrassed & disappointed in the drastically downsized act. Almost all of the aerial acts of the show were gone. I was sad to hear the same jokes from the "hostess." I thought it was clever improvisation the first time. At this performance, she forced the same jokes into the act whether they fit or not. so sad. It definitely was not as good as I had remembered. My friends said it was "okay" because they didn't have the original for comparison.
It was a really good show and I was thoroughly entertained, but I was expecting something more from Cirque.  Something whimsical and exciting and extraordinary. . . There wasn't really much out of the ordinary or anything that grabbed my attention and kept me hooked.  The acts were very well paced, the jokes were good, I would totally see it again -- just not my absolute favorite thing ever.  Not to mention I feel kind of awkward watching sex things when my elbow is half an inch from rubbing up against a complete stranger.  . . We actually arrived a bit late because we could not find the theatre inside the casino!  Luckily, they account for that and start the show a little bit later than scheduled while there's music and a bit of a warm-up act.... unless that was part of the show and I missed it.  Oh well.
My husband took me to this show when we visited Vegas earlier this year. Such a funny show that was overall really good! I was expecting it to be very provocative and promiscuous, but at times that wasn't JUST the case. It was also laugh out loud hilarious.  . . We also scored some good deals online, thus making the prices not expensive. This is one of the less expensive - Cirques we have seen. If you're rather conservative, this might not be your cup of tea. However, if you're ok with a little bit of humor and "sensual ness" you will like it. Watch it!
Having seen several Cirque shows now, I see their commonality is basically acrobatic acts some how tied by a theme. for Zumanity, attend with an open mind as you will see the range of sexuality from fat, hot, gay, transgender, midget, and comical. If you want a chance to participate or get chosen out of the audience, sit in the front section or somewhere next to the center steps. Zumanity lacks a storyline. It is a bunch of random acts of acrobatics and sensuality mixed in with intermissions of sexual comedy. My favorite acts were the flying muscular midget, and the man-woman couple doing cheerleader style lifts and the gymnast dude on the pole doing gravity-defying poses. The girls swimming in the fishbowl and contorting was like watching something alien, and the guy guy cage fighting match that turned bi-sexual was when I cringed the most. The Fabiola-looking dude that strips down to nothing is great for the ladies, and all the bare-breasted women makes looking at boobs less exciting after a while, but it's still worth keeping in the show.  . . For a full storyline show, go see Ka at MGM, or even Totem, the traveling Cirque show.
My husband and I both enjoyed this!! I was able to find cheaper tickets on the New York, New York website. At that time (not sure about now) they were offering cheaper tickets for certain dates. One of those dates worked perfectly for us. Great show, we would definitely see it again.
This was the second time I have seen this show. I was disappointed with the vocalists but the rest of the show was fantastic.The girls in the show were not very sexy except for the rope girl and one of the girls in the water. The host was fantastic!!!
