Faker gourmet restaurant. Good views, and "luxury" menu. However, this is not genuine epicurean quality. Mediocre, over-salted mid-grade food. Highly overpriced. The waitstaff appears to be nice, but does not posses genuine quality service skills. Reaching over diner to fill water, serving from the wrong side, bringing dishes in the wrong order, and errors on the order. Plated temperature indicates lack of coordination of food prep. Some items too hot, some room temp on the same plate.. . The ambiance and decor intend to be upscale, as do the prices, but there are many true high end dining experiences which are better than this place.
All I can say is wow!. . I had the Beef Wellington and I can honestly say it is the best meal I have ever had. I am not generally a big steak or pastry fan, however apparently putting those two things together creates absolute magic!. The view of The Bellagio fountain was amazing as well. If I could I would give this place a 6th star.. The added bonus was I won $600 on a slot machine just before the meal, so it was for all intents and purposes a free meal. Win win!
I do not remember the name of our waitress and nor do I want to. We didn't know asking for a piece of bread was so difficult. She wouldn't give us a slice of a baguette until after we finished our meal...who wants bread after they are finished eating? Seemed like we had to beg after asking for the manager. . . One of the "helpers" I guess you can say, Alfonso Cruz, had to be one of the absolute best. We looked forward to him actually coming to the table and asking if everything was ok even though he did not have to because he was not our waiter. Willingly, he would check on us and keep on asking if we wanted more bread (: so simple! I really would just come for his service (no lie). . . Food was not bad. It was surprisingly good. No complaints. . . Thank you Alfonso for the wonderful service! Made our night! He needs a promotion.
This review is overdue, but sadly, I was less than impressed with my experience here...and it was my birthday dinner! During a trip to Vegas, we decided to enjoy a nice dinner out at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant and actually planned ahead so we made a reservation before we got into town. We called the restaurant, requested a nice window seat and told them it was my birthday. Knowing this is a very expensive restaurant, we expected to have the same experience we've had at other expensive restaurants (in Vegas among other cities). We expected to be greeted nicely and for our reservation to be treated with some dignity. When we showed up for our restaurant, we immediately realized that this restaurant is more of a spectacle than the other fine dining options in the area. They let anyone up into the restaurant so it's very congested by the bar, loud and anything but "special." We gave our name for our reservation and the hostess lead us to our table. As I mentioned, we had made our reservations several weeks in advance and asked for a window table. . . They gave us a "window" table but that ended up being right next to a huge poll on the opposite side of the restaurant that didn't overlook the Bellagio fountains but instead the run down Bally's pool that was under construction. It was also the smallest table in the entire restaurant. Our lovely romantic dinner on my birthday was turning into a disaster very fast. We decided to ask the hostess if there was any other table available and they said possibly. So we went to the bar to have a drink and waited for another table. About 20 minutes later they took us to another table. This time, it did have a view of the fountain but it was also right in front of the server's station so we constantly had servers on our laps during the meal. After the cluster of getting a table, I barely remember the food and while we still had a good time because we were together, we won't be visiting the Eiffel Tower Restaurant again for a fine dining experience in Vegas. There are so many other places with just as good of a view, better ambiance and much, much better service!
I surprised my wife by taking her here for our 15th wedding anniversary on 6/24/2014.  What a great restaurant.  They sat us by the windows looking over the fountain.  Our server, David C., was very nice and treated us with respect.  I ordered the Seared Scallops and the Halibut.  My wife ordered the Lobster and Pinot Salmon with the Potato Gratin.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The Caramel Souffle was phenomenon.  The supervisor, Mr. Lyle Tolhurst, came to our table to congratulate us.  Very nice guy.  Thank you for everything.  I will definitely come back and will bring my entire family.  A night that I will always remember.
"go all the way to the tower...find out the secrets behind". . while it's no secret that this isn't the real Eiffel Tower, the secret is this: reasonably priced food and a surprisingly relaxed atmosphere. not things you normally expect of the French, or their Vegas colony, but nice to see.. . the spicy lamb burger is hefty, juicy, and packed with flavor. get it. do not pass go. proceeddirectly to the lamb burger. it does not disappoint. FOR GREAT JUSTICE.. . service was friendly and fast.. . the view out on the Strip is tough to beat, especially when you see the Bellagio fountains going off. worth it.
I wish every restaurant in Miami was as good as this one! You have to go in through the casino of the hotel and you are led up to the restaurant through an elevator where you are greeted and check in. I made a reservation and requested a fountain view table for our anniversary dinner. . . As we waited to be seated were had some drinks by the car which is rather small, but drinks are pretty good. Finally we sat down to our fountain view table. Best view in town!!!! The fountains play every 15 minutes at night time, it's the most beautiful thing ever! We ordered the filet mignon and it's the most delicious filet I've ever had! Everytime I order it here even in the best restaurant in Miami, it's doesn't come even CLOSE to the filet in this restaurant. Cooked to perfection! . . The service was impeccable, our waitress was excellent! This restaurant is very "high end" so you get the service you're paying for! I plan to go back to Vegas at the end of the year and this will definitely be one of my stops for dinner!!!
We had my sister's b-day dinner here. The staff was very accommodating when I told them I was bringing in my own center piece and extra stuff for the table. . Braised Chicken: this was really good must try if you are going here. Potato Croquette: theses were ok but I liked the scalloped potatoes better. Pistachio Souffle: this was amazing.. If you go here please try the souffles amazing. Your missing out if you pass on dessert. . We had already drank too much at the pool and were going to the club after dinner so we did not drink at dinner.. The view is amazing as well.
I went to Eiffel Tower after graduation and the experience was great. All the food is amazing and top quality. My only regret is not getting all the caviar I wanted. The staff is also very nice and friendly. When they learned that I had just come from graduation they gave me a dessert for free and they wrote a little French message on the plate in chocolate! It said "Happy Birthday," but it's the thought that matters.
Wow. This place. All I have to say is this place is not overrated. I went here with my boyfriend for my birthday and it was awesome. The view and the table setting was so romantic. The food was awesome. I wish I could have tried everything on the menu. If you are full you still HAVE TO get their souffle. You have to try their souffle even though you are full to your stomach.
We had a romantic brunch here w/ an amazing view overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The food was a bit overpriced, but I knew going in we were paying for the ambiance and food would come second. We tried the basic brunch items such as eggs benedict and French toast. The standout item was our dessert: Frozen strawberry souffle w/ grand marnier and pistachios. Absolutely divine!!. . At the end of our meal, it was a nice added touch, when we were given an array of chocolates to choose from.
My son and I were at the top of the Eiffel Tower doing the tourist-y Vegas thing when he asked the guard how to get to the "Other Level" that he saw from the ground (which is the restaurant).  Well, one thing led to another and before I knew it we were being given a tour of the kitchens and a seated at a table for two overlooking the Bellagio fountains!  . . It was lunch service so I had a roasted chicken and Camembert sandwich and my son (age 6) had a breaded chicken cutlet with green beans.  We also shared the Triple Chocolate Cake for dessert (YUM!!).  The food was amazing and the service was impeccable even though (like I mentioned) we didn't have a reservation and were in no way, shape, or form dressed for 5-star dining!  . . I would highly recommend this restaurant and will DEFINITELY go back again on our next trip to Vegas!!
Definitely an experience.  I've always drive by this restaurant and wondered what it would be like to eat up there.  I finally got the chance to take my bf up here for his birthday.  Great place for an occasion or romance.. . In order to make a reservation, you need to give them a credit card.  Interesting.  The view is beautiful.  You can go see the strip at sundown and the Bellagio fountains.  The tables that we were seated near the window is very tiny.  Barely have any room. I liked how they had a bread tray to choose from 4 different types of bread.  I recommend the rustic; more Frenchy.. . Service was good, not excellent like what I expected from a high-end restaurant.. . Wild Escargot on Sweet Garlic Souffle:  I wouldn't have known  they were snails.  Didn't look like it didn't taste like it.  For an appetizer, it was extremely tiny, smaller than my palm.  . Lamb chops: Umm...that price for 3 bones of lamb? That is seriously outrageous although it was mighty delicious and it melts in your mouth.. Beef Wellington: This isn't what I expected either after watching all these cooking shows.  It was technically a meat pie with a huge cube of filet in the middle. It was good and filling but not really expecting it.  . Potato Gratin: Extremely creamy.  I knew it was going to be rich but this took it to the next level.. Wild Mushrooms: If you're going to get a side, get this.. Armaretto Souffle: You must allow 45 minutes to order any Souffle and it is well worth it.  It was a light delicious cloud of armaretto.. Banana Tower Thingy: Love the white chocolate crisp with a crap ton of bananas. It was super impressive but I would got for a souffle instead.. . After each meal, they give you as much petit fours your heart desire.
By far this was the best meal we had in all of Vegas.  The place is located on the 11th floor of the Eifel tower in the Paris hotel/Casino.  The view was spectacular and the restaurant is glamorous.  We had the best service.  We ordered the pairing, where we get different wines for each course.  But since we had a 4 hour drive, we opted for no wine.  The food was wonderful.   My appetizer was Warmed seasoned shrimp over a light sauce.  My boyfriend had the spinach and mushroom strudel.  He said it just melted in his mouth.  My shrimp was delicious.  His main course was a smoked salmon over egg omelet with crunchy potato strings and capers.     I had the marinated steak over potatoes with poached egg.  OMG  the flavors were fantastic.  We thought heaven had come to earth.   Our dessert was a souffle with grand marniere   along with a topping of strawberry ice cream with diced pistachios and fresh strawberries.  It all was great.  Please visit this wonderful place.
