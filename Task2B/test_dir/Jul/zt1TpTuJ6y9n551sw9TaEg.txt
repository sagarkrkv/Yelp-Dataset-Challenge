Small bites, huge flavor, excellent presentation, succulent carving station, and a wonderful gelato spread. Best buffet I've had period. After going to that other "hot spot" in Caesar's and returning here for brunch, it was clear to me Wicked Spoon is in my view one of the top shelf buffets in Vegas.. . I love the carving station. Sliced bacon! The fancy kind you can't find at the local grocery. Housemade sausage too. Don't overlook the fresh fruit smoothies too.. . The gelato spread was most impressive. Imagine trying all the flavors in small little bowls to your heart's desire. The combinations are endless. I personally like the peanut butter and jelly.. . Best thing was my son to be (under 5) was free! Can't beat a family friendly buffet on the strip!
I have to say this is one of my favorite spots for brunch in Vegas!! I love it, they have so much to choose from. I still want to try it out for lunch or dinner, I heard it's just as good. I've been here a few times and never have I had a problem with anything here. The customer service is also great and the selection of food is awesome. I highly recomend it and will be coming back soon, maybe this time for dinner. I say you try a little bit of everything than a lot of one thing.. Enjoy..
For my fiancee's first time in Vegas she insisted on doing a buffet. Since I was going to be forced into going to one I decided to pick one of the decent ones and Wicked Spoon was my first choice. Really it wasn't bad (for buffet food), but it wasn't great either.. . I sampled the paella and it was actually ok (for buffet food), and the mac and cheese bar was an interesting addition and not bad (for buffet food), and some of the pastas were enjoyable (for buffet food), and the overall quality of everything was pretty good (for buffet food).. . Really though, a lot of food didn't work in the buffet format. Pastas in small dishes didn't really seem to sit well, rice and curries also seemed to suffer. Actually everything unique about this buffet seemed to suffer sitting in the buffet format, and the small dishes for everything and your small plates seemed to want to force you into multiple trips back to the buffet until you just can't be bothered anymore and leave. . . The good things here are the things that you see in other (cheaper) buffets. A pile of crab legs on your plate, a gigantic heap of mashed potatoes, just about anything served from a big communal trough worked (for buffet food). . . Drink service was uneven and the pricing left a bad taste in my mouth. A greyhound is like $8 (since I guess it fits their spirit+mixer format), but a salty dog which is a greyhound with a salt rim is somehow 2 or 4 dollars more? that's some expensive salt.. . So really what it comes down to is if the food that is good is the stuff that you can get in a traditional buffet format works, and the special stuff here is all kind of mediocre and suffers for sitting in the heatlamps, what's the point of coming here? I can't really find one. That being said, if you have someone who really wants to go to a buffet and you don't want the usual buffet food, then this one is ok (for buffet food).. . Edit: My fiancee just informed me the salty dog was 14 dollars(!). I'm never one to complain about price but there can't be any rationale behind that other than "You're in Vegas, fuck you."
The trick to the Wicked Spoon is to come around 1 PM on weekend days. Yes, you will spend over an hour in the purchase line and the seating line, but when you sit down around 2, 2:15, the place begins to clear and there's not much jostling for that last slice of fancy meat or cornbread. . . And the other part? Around 2:45, they begin clearing the breakfast/lunch items and begin setting out dinner dishes. We began seeing people rush towards the food at that time, so we ventured up and each got a mountain of huge crab legs. They switched the omelette station with a gourmet mac n cheese station, and put up a fancy make-your-own-ramen station.. . The desserts are all gorgeous, but we found that the best ones weren't the chocolate ones - they were the cream ones (panna cotta-like ones) or fruit ones. . . Our waitress was really nice. A friend ordered the unlimited bloody Mary and didn't like it, so she took it off the bill, no problem.
Honestly, this is as good as it gets! . . The servers are very attentive. They make sure your plates are cleared and drinks are toped off. . . And the Food  is amazing! The presentation is eye friendly and the quality and variety is what you expect when going to a Vegas buffet.
It's the only buffet I go to on the strip. It is about $36 for bunch $48 for brunch with unlimited mimosas and a little over $55 for dinner. The best deal for your buck is to come here for before 3pm but close to it for the unlimited mimosa brunch so you can get drunk and eat. The best part about doing a late lunch is that you pay brunch price but you get dinner food items. Dinner doesn't have unlimited alcoholic drinks which is why I rather do that. . . Just eat all the crab legs and drink all the mimosas you can. Their Thai tea ice cream to finish it all off is also amazing.. . It is expensive here, but it's vegas.
I came here on a Wednesday night so I only waited about 20 minutes for a party of 3 which isn't too bad for a buffet as popular as Wicked Spoon. . . I've heard a lot of good things about this place, so I decided to try it for myself. I didn't really enjoy it to be honest. In my opinion, there wasn't very much variety. Nothing really stood out to me taste wise and I didn't really go back for any seconds.
I finally tried the brunch here and it was delicious. The dinner was so so. At our last stay at the Cosmo, my gf really wanted to go to Wicked Spoon but we had to check out, so on our last day, we went to the Wicked Spoon for brunch.. . I was previously disappointed by the dinner here so I was hesitant to try out the brunch. So the selection here isn't as large as Bacchanal but it was great overall. Everything I tried was delicious minus the indian cuisines. Way too much spices for me. . . Some of the notable dishes for brunch included bone marrow, the Asian porridge, dubuki, and duck eggs benedict. Overall, the dishes were all pretty decent. The dessert here was really good as well, I liked the thai tea gelato, chocolate oreo strawberry and coffee cake. . . So why the 3 star review? It is an average between brunch and dinner, the brunch was 4 stars but the dinner was 2 stars for me.. . Overall, come here for brunch but go to bachannal for dinner.
Server was good and there wasn't much a food selection as compared to a cheaper station casino buffet but it was tasty and the cinnamon French toast was to die for!!! About 35 per person for brunch and 40 for dinner. I will eat here again.....eventually.
First I must state I have NEVER been a fan of buffets. I come from the south: the land of the baptist church on every corner and buffet across the street. It's always the same too, where only one-tenth of the food choices interest me and they are prepared and taste badly.. . Wicked Spoon was only slightly better than those southern buffets.. . However, a few things I got were really good like the goat cheese panna cotta, the salads were crisp and topped with good dressings, the grilled artichokes were perfection.. . But.... the stuff I didn't like tasted really awful. The Cajun shrimp (my apologies to Mississippi delta folk and lovers of Vietnamese Cajun restaurants) were terrible - overlooked and drowning in a bad sauce that was underseasoned and not spicy. The saffron rice would have been good if the rice was cooked through. The prime rib was good as long as you got the spice-rubbed end. And the desserts were all meh except for the gelato.. . For $50 I'd rather have gone to a better place and had a single plate of food served to me (and not have to stand in line for it) where all the items were cooked well and tasty.
We definitely enjoyed the options at the dessert station.  The small bites are a nice way to try a variety of flavors.  Our waitress was attentive and the wait time for seating was minimal.
Had the brunch and dinner buffets on separate days.  There was crossover of items between brunch and dinner which was a little disappointing, but I guess it would be next to impossible to do completely different options at every station.  It's good quality for a buffet.
This buffet tops them all. Forget about the traditional, boring old buffets. Wicked Spoon has bomb ass, gourmet food with a sweet & modern presentation.  I was real impressed with their selection, and enjoyed dining here with the girls post-pool party.
It was just ok.  4 stars for variety and appearance.  Dessert collection is great.  Omelette line long as ever!  Yogurt, sushi, angry Mac and cheese, and kale salad was the best.  Oh and expensive, make sure you go hungry for the brunch buffet, get your money worth!
First visit was great about two years ago. This year I had to let people know not to come here. I had a small issue with the place and asked to speak to the manager. He did nothing but blow it up into a huge deal. This small people with the place turned info a full refund and my party of four (for my wife's birthday) got up and left. We didn't eat. To top it off the manager had the nerve to try and run his mouth at me while giving me my refund. NEVER AGAIN will I return to this Hotel, Casino or Restaurant. The attitude alone from the manger was so disrespectful I can't believe he's manager in a hotel I THOUGHT was a respectful place to enjoy a vacation. Never again.
Not the best buffet in Vegas but it is a definite must-go spot if you love bone marrow. I went on Sunday and their lunch was $39 and dinner $45.
We debated between Wicked Spoon and Baachanal since we had never been to either.  We went to Wicked Spoon because of the horror stories of the Baachanal wait time.  We went for brunch on a Saturday.  We waited about 45 minutes total, not too bad.  It is $39 for Saturday brunch.  . . We were a little disappointed in the selection.  The food was pretty good but really there were not a lot of options.  The cashier explained the buffet to us and said that there are usually not crab legs at brunch but today there were for the holiday weekend.  (For $39 there should always be crab legs).  And the crab legs were small!  Nothing like the crab legs at Rio or Wynn buffets.. . Some of the best items were the fresh fruit shooter, beef and broccoli, wedge salad, mac and cheese, and culotte beef.  The desserts were fabulous though.  The chocolate moulton cake was amazing!  Get it with some gelatto and it's heaven.  I also loved the little chocolate cone with white chocolate and apricot filling, the gelato, peanut butter cookie, and lemon meringue tart.  The little square bites of different cakes were forgettable.  Definitely save room for dessert!
My one "traditional" buffet experience during my recent business trip to Vegas.  My friend and I came here for breakfast.  Located in what seemed to be the deepest part of the Cosmopolitan Resort, it was quite a trek back there.  In any event, I was thoroughly pleased with the selection and the quality.  Avoiding all of the usual breakfast suspects, I focused on the "every meal" items, such as the Wicked Macaroni and Cheese, the fried sweet plantains with creme fresh, the various Chinese "take out" boxes, and the carving station.  To drink, I frequently grabbed the shot glasses of Wicked Juice, a non-alcoholic mixture of three fruit juices...delicious!  Once the main meal items were enjoyed, I hit the vast gelato bar, trying three of the delectable flavors!  All in all, I liked the "single portion" concept they have here and loved the gelato bar!  I do wish though that their famous bone marrow was available that morning; I totally wanted to try that.  Oh well, I will be back!
I was disappointed by this place - maybe I was expecting too much.  They didn't have as much to offer as I thought they would based on how expensive and highly rated it is.  I went for the Fourth of July holiday dinner ($47.99 before tax) and there didn't appear to be any special "holiday" items.  There was limited seafood (flavorless snow crab and shrimp, dry salmon), and the prime rib was also dry.  Some of the more unusual buffet items were good, like the gnocchi, heirloom tomato salad and the lamb curry.  It sounds weird, but I loved the pistachio nut mix.. . The best part of the buffet (by far) is the dessert selection.  Chocolate/oreo covered strawberries, lemon tarts, pistachio cake, etc.  I highly recommend the housemade gelato/sorbet.  The flavors are unique and taste really high quality.  I may or may not have had 6 scoops.. . Everything is still a step up from your standard Vegas buffet, just not as amazing as it looks in photos.  If you are looking for a decent buffet with an extraordinary selection of desserts, this is your place.
We went on a Saturday for lunch. the asian section and sushi was especislly bad and stale. Bbq is okay at best. Dessert was satisfactory. Also there was not a lot of selection as i thought there would be. I know I'm going to get alot of dislikes for this review but I don't care haha haha hahahahahahahahaha
Stopped in on a Saturday, where it was $41 a head.  The GF was moving back from Vegas to Reno, and wanted to do one last Vegas buffet (we had done Bacchanal a few months previously).. . While Bacchanal felt big and over the top, Wicked Spoon felt more restrained.  Don't get me wrong - the selection was large and varied, but while Bacchanal felt like it was turned to 11, Wicked Spoon was more a 7 or an 8.  On the other hand, we only had a 30 or 45 minute wait compared to the 90 minute wait at Bacchanal.. . One thing that seemed to set this place apart was the focus on single serves, almost amuse-bouche style, with everything from the shrimp cocktail to the desserts being small, one or two bite pieces.  This is actually perfect for a buffet, letting you sample a wide plethora.  On the other hand, the quality of the dishes was generally just meh.  Nothing really blew me away - most things were just average.. . Crab legs seemed a little skimpy, and I'm not a fan of the sliced-in-half legs that seems to be the trend these days.  I much prefer the notched crab legs, that take a bit of work to break, but reward you with much large chunks of crab meat.. . An exception to the average quality would be the made to order mac and cheese.  I'm going to guess this is usually an omelet station in the mornings, as the items were basically the same: bacon, shrimp, spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, garlic, cheeses, etc.  Add in a decadent white sauce and you get some of the richest, most gluttonous mac and cheese I've had.  No subtle flavors here - this is a right-hook to the taste buds.. . The GF really appreciated the dessert bar, which was wide and varied, and again, lots of tiny bites.  . . I would say one miss for me was the plates - even for the salad and dessert bars, the plates had come straight from the dishwasher, being almost uncomfortable warm.  For the dessert bar, it was hot enough that it caused the chocolate desserts I put on my plate to melt, leaving my chocolate covered strawberry in a little puddle.. . I think we got what we paid for - we paid maybe 20% less than Bacchanal, and probably got 80% of the quality.
Ended up stopping here on a mid-Friday morning after our flight landed at McCarran for their version of 'brunch'.  For $27, I must admit it was outstanding.  A giant selection of good quality food.  I'd definitely come back.
"Eh" is all I have to say.. . Located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel next to Rose. Rabbit. Lie. We came here for my bf's bday dinner. $38 per person, $56 if you wanted unlimited wine or beer. There was no line on a Wednesday night so we were seated in about 10 minutes. . . The layout is beautiful. Warm and inviting. There were crystal decorations hanging from the ceiling throughout the restaurant. There's even a glass jar of water at your table so you won't have to ask the server for more water refills. Our server's name was Vladimir and he was on top of his game. Clearing our used plates and refilling our iced teas. . . The food on the other hand was the reason for the low stars. They offer small portions, which is great because then you get to sample everything instead of loading up on certain things. For some reason, I ended up eating a lot of salads. A wedge salad, Cesar salad, beats salad, papaya salad, ceviche (kind of a salad)...you get the picture.  The salads were very fresh and flavorful though. I just wasn't blown away by the actual hot food items. The only hot food items I remember picking up were tacos, chicken wings, bone marrow, and soup. Nothing stood out as "omg I need to get more of this." And the chicken wings smelled like arm pit. The bf did enjoy the prime rib and spicy sausage. . . As for the dessert bar, very underwhelming. They had chocolate covered strawberries, macarons, gelato and a few other pastries. I tried everything since I have the biggest sweet tooth. I felt bad because almost all the desserts I picked up went to waste. I took one bite and didn't like any of it. I have to say I did enjoy the chocolate covered strawberries and the pistachio gelato. I even got seconds of them. . . All in all, I like trying new places to eat. But if I were to eat at a buffet again, I'd just stick with Bacchanal at Ceasar's Palace.
I am not generally a buffet person, but as they say, "when in Vegas"..... . Being the good yelper that I am, I did a lot of research on the important subject of "buffets" before my latest trip to Vegas.  Everyone has their own opinion as to which is the best, but Wicked Spoon looked the most unique to me.. . Since it was a holiday weekend, the dinner price was $47.99. I was kind of expecting to get some extras because of the holiday, but it appeared to be the usual fare.  What I found disappointing about the buffet, was that it does not have nearly the selection that I thought it would. It was large for a standard buffet, but I felt it was small for a Vegas buffet.  I have read that the carving station is the best part of this buffet, but I majorly disagree.  The sausage had a weird flavor, the ribs were very dry, and so was the prime rib.  We came early in the evening, so maybe they bring a larger selection of meat out later on.... . My highlights were the salads, the poke, the gnocchi and the desserts.  The food is all presented really well, but that doesn't matter if it doesn't taste good!  The exception is the dessert, it looks and tastes good.  I was told they have a famous pastry chef on staff, and you can tell.  Save room for the gelato!
I'll preface this review with the statement that I've never been to a buffet that I would go back to this being one of them. Back in the days when buffets were $10, it was somewhat worthy of going just to gaze around and take a few bites. Now with costs($30) well past the price of a decent entree, buffets are hardly worthwhile unless you like mounds of mediocre food. . . This place definitely has the selection but like all buffets, the food is dry and old. It's not really their fault as that's the inherent nature of a buffet since the food sits there for anywhere between 30-60minutes. . . The only reason this place got two stars from me was the huge dessert selection.
A attendant in charge of the drinking service close to the entrance is the only good memory today. He works so hard and friendly. He really cares about the customers.. . In terms of food, I'm really disappointed. No big surprise here. Everything is plain and average.. . The ridiculous thing is their name is "wicked spoon" but I didn't find the spoon after I ask for it for three times.. . Not really recommended.
I have no idea how this place has 4 stars.   Afterwards, we were practically offended that it cost us over $100 to eat here. . The only plus this place has is that the customer service was great.. The selection is decent, but for that amount of money, we expected more.  They serve small servings so you can try a lot of different things.  . The carving station has sausages, prime rib, and regular ribs.  My husbandsaid the sausage and prime rib were very dry.  The ribs were so tough that even using his teeth, he couldn't pull off the meat.  . Paella - bland and dry. Lamb Curry -  The taste was off.  Almost like it had gone bad.. Fried chicken - Average taste, but dry. Sushi - didn't taste fresh, was dry. Shepherds Pie - no seasoning at all. It was bland mush in your mouth.. You get the idea. Dish after dish, we could only take one bite.  We were so disgusted we decided to not try any more and just try out the dessert bar.  Other than the gelato, it was no better than you would get in any Chinese buffet.  We were so very, very disappointed.
For the amount of time I waited and the money spent, not really impressed. People were saying that the quality went down, and now I believe it. I'm not saying that it wasn't good, but it wasn't greater either.
I'm not sure if it was an off night or that it was Sunday but I was very disappointed by this Buffet. Waited in a very short line to pay only to wait in another line for about 20 min. After being seated I was ready to eat. The selection seemed decent and the prime rib was good. However other traditional buffet food was missing like turkey or ham at the carving station.  The Asian selection was mediocre with the best dish the pork fried rice. I looked around for other food to try only to be further let down with the lack of any appetizing selections. Out of the dishes I tried most seemed to be sitting out to long or lacked good flavor. The service was decent with frequent drink refills and clearing of plates. Maybe I should have gone to the Bellagio or Caesars buffet as I left feeling unsatisfied. I will not return.
I came here around 12-1ish pm and luckily we didn't have to wait that long and got there before the rush.  . . I think I had too high of an expectation for this place that when I actually got there, I was a tad disappointed.  From the pictures I saw before coming here, I thought the food section was larger.  I was over-hyped about this place, as you can see. . . But nonetheless, I loved it.  Awesome variety of food.  Some things there were definitely a hit-or-miss, especially the Asian food section. The fried rice and dukboki tasted like... nothing.  The bone marrow.. tasted like nothing; no hint of seasoning, nothing.  I think the carving station was pretty good and the whole range of veggies and salads were delectable.  I know, I know. Who goes to a buffet to eat vegetables?  But I gotta try everything. . . And I came with a group of 8; we didn't know about the gratuity fee for large groups. Wow.  Gosh darn it. . . You can definitely try out every single thing here if you eat strategically with the people you come with.  Make it your money's worth.
All this hype I heard about wicked spoon. Let me tell you, does not live up to the hype.  Prime rib felt like rubber.  Crab legs were cold.  Their version of ramen tasted undercooked and had the texture of playdoe.  I honestly think their sausage and dessert was the best thing there.  Would I go back? Probably not.
I wanted to love this place but we had a horrible experience last night. . At first, I was impressed with the selection of food and the presentation. I took several pictures excited to share them with my social networks...But then things got ugly!. . We were a ladies group of 10 instead of 13, we thought they were kind enough to reserve the table of 13 for us because we were celebrating a bride-to-be, but really it wasn't out of kindness, it was a CONTRACT. This was thrown in our face several times by the server and the manager at the end of our meal demanding payment for the 3 extra heads. We tried to explain what happened with the extra people but they weren't hearing it, why? Because we signed a CONTRACT!. . Regardless of what we signed, we are not professional event planners and the CONTRACT wasn't explained to us properly to begin with. As we tried to straighten this out and explain things and ask for some understanding and flexibility, the manager became increasingly irritated and threatened to charge us several hundred dollars for being at the table for more than 2 hours..why? Because we signed a CONTRACT! And CONTRACT groups only get 2 hours at a table. . . So I asked him, "If we just waited in line, instead of reserved this table, would we be charged for 10 heads instead of 13 heads and be able to sit here as long as we wanted?" He said yes, but YOU have a CONTRACT!" . . So our beautiful bride-to-be who flew all the way from Italy for this special week said "Wow, you kind of have a bad attitude" then he got all worked up and threatened us and called security. And we were "escorted out". Even the security guards, while still doing their job, thought this was silly. . . Seriously, a bunch of 30-40 year old professional women including television producers, military women who serve this country, and hard working mothers, are THAT threatening. It was ridiculous, embarrassing, and unnecessary...But apparently, we signed a CONTRACT! . . I have dined at many many many fine restaurants in Las Vegas, with many groups of women, where I gladly paid $75, $100, even $150 for a nice dinner. The bride CHOSE to try the Wicked Spoon buffet so we went there instead of a normal restaurant, and she ends up getting booted?!?!?!?. . I have never ever dealt with such an unprofessional and inflexible establishment. The whole fiasco was utterly ridiculous.
Some standouts include:. . Custom Mac n Cheese- I know who get's mac n cheese at a buffet at a Vegas buffet but trust me it's a must try. . Calamari on a stick- Was suprisingly good!. . Miso Soup- Not particularly creative but was cool to see. . Tres Leches Cheesecake- Delicous . . Comparision vs Bacchanal:. . Pros: Cheaper . . About the Same: Quality  of food . . Negatives: Not as many choices of food .                      Service was significantly better at Bacchanal although it was solid here.                       too
By far my favorite restaurant within Las Vegas.. . Here is what happened: my crew and I had been anticipating Wicked Spoon for three months. You see, those YouTube videos posted of Wicked Spoon made it nearly unbearable for me to not be able to stuff my face in a bowl of macaroni & cheese laced with bacon, shrimp, green peppers, and other tasty items. As the time winded to make the trip to Vegas, everyone in the crew had the same plan: get off the plane, drop everything off at the hotel, head STRAIGHT down to Cosmopolitan and indulge into the greatness known as Wicked Spoon.. . I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a hot Thursday night: we got off the plane, dropped everything off at the hotel, and headed STRAIGHT down to Cosmopolitan. We landed right at the entrance of Wicked Spoon. Let's get to the point of this review shall we? Wicked Spoon is the shit, not much more needs to be said. From the aforementioned mac and cheese bar, to the bone marrow (which I had for the first time), to the prime rib section, to the desert section, everything was phenomenal. . . I think I hit that mac and cheese bar like three damn times. I could have made a flick the way I was punishing that mac and cheese on that hot Thursday evening. . . To all my friends reading this review: if you go to Vegas, you better go to Wicked Spoon. Its not even an option, its a must. Then after that, scratch whatever restaurant plan you had the next day and come right back to Wicked Spoon for an encore.
After reading and seeing all the food porn I was convinced Wicked Spoon was the buffet for us. I was really intrigued by the novelty of their tapas like style of serving but it quickly waned when I realized the food wasn't able to live up to the hype.. . I was most excited and equally disappointed by the craving station (prime rib, leg of lamb, and bone marrow). All three lacked seasoning and felt very pedestrian. I was expecting these dishes to take it to the next level and showcase how it should be done. . . Stand outs where truly unexpected such as cauliflower mash, salad bar area, and most impressive the dessert bar!!!. . Desserts are never my go to thing but for Wicked Spoon I would change that tune in a heart beat. A great amount of details go into each dessert and rich in flavor with just the right amount of sweetness. . . Overall Thoughts. . While my dinner experience at Wicked Spoon is contrary to popular opinion, Iideally would like to go back for a second try perhaps for lunch or breakfast
Unfortunately the food did not meet expectations. I was excited about the individual dishes but the quality was poor overall. Dishes were not seasoned well and tasteless. The bone marrow bones were dried out. The breakfast buffet was odd. Got there at 8:30am and there were more dinner items then actual breakfast items. Could not help but wonder if it was simply leftovers from the night before. I love a good buffet but this was not.
This is so good very pricey though they have a lot good bone marrow, shrimp ceviche, mashed potatoes creamy, good quality cakes, if your a adventurous eater I'd recommend this. Risotto done right, lamb, prime rib, Along with very good desserts except the macaroons This one review is a little late but here it is getting a new review next time ago
I went to the buffet tonight around 8sh pm with one of my old friend and he is handicap and one of the chefs a tall guy   was walking in the buffet and he saw my friend and he offered his help caring my friend's plate all round the buffet. Friendly staff we do appreciate it, and most of all best buffet in the strip. . I would love to come at wicked spoon over n over again....
I liked the food. The food was great. It's different to other buffets because the portions are already plated for you in perfect morsels so you can eat a little bit of everything. We had lunch here during the weekday for $27 per person. That's a reasonable priced buffet for Vegas.. They had a seafood area (I don't like seafood so I can't comment on it), they had a carving station area and the beefs and chicken were great and well-flavored, then they had a "comfort foods" area with fried chicken and macaroni and cheese (this was really good), an Italian food area, Asian food area, and an entire area for desserts.. . The only reason I give tis a 3 and not a well-deserved 4 is because of the service. We were almost through our first plate of food and we had to stare down a waiter to bring us something to drink. When we got up for more food, they didn't come and take our dirty plates. We had to start stacking the bunch of little tiny plates from the pre-plated foods we had eaten. Vegas is all about the service, but for some reason, this place missed the mark on this. . . Other than that, the food is great and worth eating. Just make sure you're not too thirsty like I was.
Hands down this is the BEST buffet I have ever been to! I have referred a few friends and family here and I've never heard anything negative! This is in the Cosmopolitan hotel and this is where my husband and I stayed. We stumbled upon it and it was the largest buffet I have ever seen! They had everything from red velvet pancakes to prime rib to mimosas to the most unbelievable desert buffet I have ever seen! I could have stayed there all day! So if you are in Vegas stop in here! It will be on my list each trip back we make!
Food was good. Desserts are amazing.. But bad bad bad customer service. I will never go back.
price 27 usd for lunch per person. My 3 year old was free.. . service: buffet standard. . ambiance: dont know why some people think this place looks cool.  Has the cruise ship dining room feel.  Will e outdated in next few years. . food. great.  Comparing this to otehr buffets I think this place is great.  I tried alot so let  me come up with a list. pizza good. salad in general good. mac cheese bad. fried chicken wing good. italian dishes in general bad. gelato good. chinese take out box things bad. pork belly good but bad for my arteries. . My new favorite vegas buffet. I think its worth the money
I have been there for just about every service they offer - I like the lunch the best. LOVE the pre-portioned offerings. I really enjoyed the desert section every time! . Most of the time service is great, but every once in a while the service isn't as good as normal.. . Overall this is one of my two favorite buffets in Vegas!
I have to say this place had wonderful presentation, but the food was not as wonderful. Actually farfrom it. They had plenty of things to choose from but all of it was very dried out from sitting under heat lamps, among other things. I got probably 3 full plates of food and only liked one item, the lamb curry and it was okay. For how much I spent I was definitely disappointed... will not return.
I ate at the Wicked Spoon the day after eating at a buffet that cost about $25. As they say, you get what you pay for. I'd much rather pay $40 for the quality of food served at WS.. . I visited the Wicked Spoon on a Thursday about 5. It was perfect timing. My group beat the crowd by about 30-45 min. The set-up was clean. There were plenty of options- not as many options as a cheaper buffet- but quality over quantity.. . I like meat, so I was practically stuck at the meat station. Prime rib was decent, but the pork loin and top sirloin were great. The crab legs were on the thin side, but on the upside you can ask the server to steam them for you.. . I rarely eat dessert at buffets, but was attracted to the apple cobbler, served warm in an individual pan. I made my own a la mode with the ice cream.. . Again, for the quality the price was reasonable. At this point in time, WS tops my list in the buffet department.
We had a group of 5 excited to dine at a buffet on the Las Vegas strip. Unfortunately, we picked the wrong place. The food was subpar and luke warm. Not one item made any of us go back for seconds. It was disappointing to say the least. I would never recommend this spot. What a flop.
Geez....what a disappointment.  Get rid of your cute presentation and concentrate on food quality.  Wish I had asked for a refund after finding a little bug in my salad.  I was someone's guest and did t want them to feel bad
The food quality is good, but I did not see it to be what everyone was raving about. I try not to compare restaurants, but since this is vegas with so many choices, I'd have to say that the bellagio buffet was a lot better due to flavor, quality, choices, and overall variety of foods to choose from. I did try almost everything that was offered, but just did not compare. . . If I'm ever back in vegas, I will probably not be going back.
Summary: Attended Wick Spoon for a wedding so really I don't know how much it is per head and I don't intend to find out. The setting was dark which I don't understand why, do they not want us to see what we're eating? But after sampling majority of their food I assume the darkness is so other guest doesn't see me split out the food.. . Food: Their weekend dinner selection was below average. Nothing stand out or mind blowing. The only thing I can actually compliment on was their salmon which wasn't bland and their shrimp cocktail. The sauce was different. It was sweet and sour at the same time and the taste wasn't too strong on the palate. I would avoid the desert section, flavorless and full of sugar. . . Service: The staff was very friendly though. I don't know was it because we book a private room so we have personal server but they were very attentive and always on time to refill our beer and wine. The staff was very professional throughout our stay which I understand can be tough at times especially you know, asian and their endless alcohols. . . Overall: Of all the buffet I experience in Vegas, I think I'll stick with Bellagio for the time being until someone recommend we try a new place. But definitely Wick Spoon is off the table permanently.
Very good surprise. With this buffet. Very various and nice food. Even for the breakfast every food including the deserts are present. I hardly recommend . Can easily be compared to the wynn buffet
Ate here this weekend for dinner.  The food was pretty good and liked the individual portion sizes.  The desserts were good especially the gelato but the best thing I think was this watermelon treat in the fruit section that had lime and a bit of spicy sauce over it and the pork belly was pretty good too.   A good place to try a bunch of different stuff.  Not as much option for the size of the buffet area alot, of wasted space.  But still a very good place to hit up but still not my top buffet on the strip
Maybe I expected too much since it's the number 1 rated buffet in Vegas right now, but I was let down. . . All of the food I tried was good, and they had some unique offerings for sure (roasted bone marrow), but there just weren't that many options. How can a buffet not have a salad bar? And why isn't there fruit on the dessert station? . . Overall, my favorite part was the $12 endless wine and the company of my friends. I doubt I'll visit this one again.
I went here a few weeks ago. I went here before 2 years ago. I was depressed when I came here. They did not have all the yummy stuff that they had years ago. Desserts were OK. Very pricey. The gelato station was delicious. The raspberry was amazing. Decor was awesome! We went at about 4-5. No line:) Very clean. No messes on floors, very sainitary. Probobly not coming back, though. Although, one bite of the raspberry sorbet, and you're flying to heaven.:):):)
The best buffet ever.. . Let's see, when you hear of buffets in Vegas Wicked Spoon is a name you'll hear often. I definitely think Wicked Spoon takes the cake for the best buffet in Vegas as well as the best buffet I've had in my life.. . Maybe it doesn't have all-you-can-eat crab legs but one thing it does have is creativity and  uniqueness in every plate. There are definitely some interesting things here at Wicked Spoon. I'm a foody, I'm overweight, I write on Yelp, I order extra appetizers just to try them, I tryunique food from other regions. Despite all this Wicked Spoon still managed to impress me with uniqueness and creativity in all their dishes. . . Wicked Spoon has a wide array of different flavors, goes the extra mile, and then some. If you're going to Las Vegas you must try Wicked Spoon!
All sorts of food and everything was well prepared. Enjoyed my time here with family and friends and the service was to the tee. You definitely get what you pay for here. From the tacos, to the salads, salmon, loaded mashed potatoes, the ice cream! I cannot wait to be back.
I will preference by saying that I am glad I came and tried it, however it wasn't as good as I was expecting.  I came around 8:00 and they close at 9:00, so I feel as though that may have something to do with it.  Most of the small pre-plated items I tried, while still warm, had clearly been out for quite some time. They just didn't taste fresh.  The bread selection was bleak and stale.  There were only a few meat options at the carving station and honestly they weren't that great.  A lot of the desserts were gone and there wasn't a huge selection, what I did try was good, however.  Overall, there were a lot less options than I would have expected.  . . HOWEVER, I will say the crab legs were great...hard to go wrong with those though.  And the Mac & Cheese station was to die for!  It was so good. Loved all the options you could get in the Mac & Cheese.  That alone basically made it worthwhile!  . . It was $38 for dinner, which is less than I was expecting, so that was a nice surprise.  Or you could do $50 for all you can drink wine.  If I was looking to drink, that would have been a huge bonus.  I would try it again, but I would definitely come earlier when I knew they'd be adding fresher options more often.
Loved Loved Loved Wicked Spoon! . . Beautiful decor, comfortable seating and super helpful staff! . . Hong was our server and he was super attentive charming and on point. . . I loved all the stations with the preportioned food. to some people it may be a turn off but for people with severe food allergies, like myself or germaphobia like my mother this was heaven sent.  I felt confident and sure that all the food and dishes were clean. It also made it easier for me to get a bite at nearly every station. . . The French toast w/ honey butter or chant illy creme and Pancakes w/  coconut icing are to die for! The breakfast panini was delicious and not to greasy or dried out. The fried chicken nugget/wings wi/ Granch dressing was Delicioussss. Teriyaki chicken was bomb and the Saffron Risotto was soooo good! (just add chicken to it to make it feel more complete.) The bacon/ pork belt Slab was so flavorful and savory and I loved the the lil Chinese rice takeout boxes cute unique touch. I would've loooved the Mac n cheese if it wasn't so spicy. It was rich creamy cheesy but then an unexpected kick came and it was too much for me (*tear*). . . . champagne/Mimosas were delicious and strong! we stumbled across the blueberry pineapple banana juice at the breakfast station (mix that w/ glass of champagne you won't regret it) . . and the Dessert bar! omg it was soooooo good I made three trips to it but stopped going because I felt Embarassed so I sent my bf to grab me more and more lmao.  the gelatos are so good and by far my fav dessert was the Coffee Torte! I atelike 5 of them. The mini cheesecakes were so creamy good and Reese's dipped strawberries were bombb too! . . ahh I'm getting fat and hungry just thinking of wicked spoon! we're coming back for you next time we're in vegas.
I had high hopes.. Too high.  . Service was good, though the way they ask for tip up front is odd.. But it's a buffet.  I do most of the serving myself.  I'm here for the food.. The Cosmopolitan being as posh and edgy as it is I really thought I would get the same from the buffet.  Really well done high quality food with some slightly bizarre surprises mixed in.. Everything was ok.  Not horrible (except for the bone marrow, come on guys!)  but nothing was great.  Nothing.  it was all completely underwhelming..  I mean, your name is wicked spoon, you really need to up your game.
Tapas style buffet. Wide variety of food ranging all cuisines for $36 a person. Excellent meat selections, salads and gelato ice creams
Such a disappointment. I really don't understand what the fuss is all about. I probably ate there on a bad night...but $50 was really not worth it. The only 3 things I was happy with were, the papaya salad, the teriyaki chicken, and the banana macaroon. I could eat that anywhere and still be satisfied for much cheaper.
I'm a foodie. Love food. This was fun and yummy. Wished I had an empty vat as a stomach so I could have tried everything!. When I went on yelp b4 hand I wanted to know what was offered so I'm going to do everyone a solid and give you the scoop. This is what they serve at breakfast.... Pancakes & french toast - perhaps my favorite french toast of all time. I despise the dry bread dipped in egg most places like to call french toast- this is decadent and delightful- offered with honey butter, whipped cream, syrup and powdered sugar. I even got creative on my next round and poured the special pineapple banana berry juice as syrup! Yum. Eggs Benedict- one with braised beef and the other with smoked salmon. Imagine my surprise when the English muffin was actually toasty and not a soft piece of mush! Score, again! . Standard omelette bar.. Carving station- roast beef, ham, sausage, and bacon!!! A slab of bacon. Only needed a taste since it was pretty epic, again, fun little touch.. Speaking of fun touches, everyone mentions the individual sized pots with macaroni and cheese, gnocchi, risotto with saffron, creamed corn & polenta. I loved the polenta with mushrooms! There's pizza, too.. There's a salad bar station, yes with both Caesar salad and blue cheese wedge! Individual servings, so great!. There's smoked salmon and bagels, cured meats, beets with truffle oil, fruits, etc.. There's an entire Asian station with 5 spice pork, teriyaki chicken.. Sushi, noodles, fried rice, shrimp, . The desserts were all super special. Each looked like a special piece of art. . The mango cake was amazing, the chocolate covered strawberries were the best I've ever had, the gelato was creamy I tried 4 scoops in one tiny bowl. And I thought the presentation of the lava cake and cobblers were special too. Get a scoop of vanilla to go with those :). For $27 you also get juice, tea and coffee.. $39 includes bottomless mimosa, champagne or Bloody Mary.
The amount of food is about 40% less than the ceasars palace buffet, but the food they have is just as good if not Better. This place is located on floor two of the cosmopolitan hotel next to the bellegio. The dessert is 5 stars by itself .
Delicious meats at the carving station, especially the prime rib and lamb.  The seafood was also nice and fresh.  The lamb Panini was also delicious.  Yummy macaroons, gelato and lemon tart. The Caesar salad was a bit over dressed where it was a bit soggy.  The roasted pork belly was disappointing - tough and the skin wasn't crisp.  I wish I had room to try the other things but that was all I was able to cover.  Well worth the price just for the carving station, seafood and dessert!  The great thing is that they also have a $20 takeout option.  The container looked like it was a good size so, although you won't be able to fill with a ton of options, definitely worth it for $20
Food was okay, could have been better for the money, my family ate for about $250.00.  Ohh and I put my plate down in the wrong place and this Mexican psycho behind the counter started chastising me, listen Mexican for $250.00 I will put my damn plate anywhere I want!
The hostess who does the seating was really rude.  She wanted to seat us in the front table and I asked to be seated at a different table and she exhibited a few poor non verbal  expressions.  She rolled her eyes and made a snide face and  told us therewere no other tables available so we waited and watched as she seated give other groups before she seated us.  The entire time we waited she didn't seat any one at the  front table that she wanted to seat us.   She was rude, and she did a poor job representing the hotel.   The food was amazing, however there are several $40 buffets in the Las Vegas area and you don't have to put up with crappy customer service.  So when you spend $86.00 on a buffet for two, don't expect a smile, because your not getting one!  We will try the five or six of the other $40 buffets before we go back to the Wicked Spoon.
We came here for lunch, and everything was perfect. Desserts were very good. Different variety of food was just overwhelming! I had 5 rounds all in all including sweets. Nice ambiance. I considered the price cheap for what u get. Definitely will come back here when I visit LV next time!

Cannot recommend this place enough. The brunch buffet and bottomless mimosas are the best way to start your day in Vegas. Julia was our waitress the first day and she treated us so well we requested her again the second day. The chocolate covered strawberries are a must but they don't come out until 11am. There is a 2 hr limit from when you order your first mimosa until they will stop refilling you. So go at 9:30 or later to make sure you can enjoy your champagne and eat chocolate covered strawberries :)
Let me start by saying how excited I was all week to come here ... But how dissatisfied I was when I finally tried the food.. whatever you saw on tv or in photos is a let down to the real thing .. it truly saddens me to have to say this but I wouldn't give it another try .. plz don't take my word go ahead and try for yourself but remember I warned you ..the food is bland and conveniently pre plated yes but presentation over quality is distasteful ... Some of the things I've seen on tv that I went eager to try aren't there anymore and don't even talk about fried chicken when you get it this bad.. the skin was on it still and if you know cuisine you must take that off when cooking it in this manor.. I mean who was cooking the food the bench chefs.. c'mon it was Sunday still a popular day in Vegas during July .. I'm sorry Cosmo this food is as bad as your parking garage ..
Although Las Vegas has the best buffets I've ever tried, I normally associate buffets with cheap, all-you-can-eat, stuff-your-face food. Not this place. Wicked Spoon took my expectations and blew them out of the water. The food and variety was amazing. While they had all the regular things people normally see at buffets (pizza, chicken, etc), they also had many exotic flavors which I really enjoyed and am positive that you will too. I will be visiting them again.
Tooooo disappointed..... I was want to give three Starnes it was not that bad but there are many five star and I really want ppl know what's going on now.... When they grand opening, was $23/person. It was so good!!! Nice steak, salmon, crap, also outstanding desert ..... Around two years after, I went it again, as it was my #1 choice. $35 (around) per person. No more salmon available but smoked salmon.... It still ok, as it has great desert..... . Ok.... I went there last Saturday for $44 with tax per person with my friend, who never been to Vegas . He asked me why u love this buffet ad it's below average..... I would rather find a hold.... There only a smoked salmon Pizza... Poor quality steak and desert was not like before... There is no point I should go back there! Very disappointed me! It's not only I pay over 40 for a dinner, it was like destroy my dream.... I will never go to any buffet at Vegas... The $20 buffet at Rowland heights is better than this! . I have question for the management, why you do this? Because you have pretty good rate at yelp? You are destroying yourself!
We loved Wicked Spoon's amazing buffet from their variety of culinary dishes to their appetizers and small plates. I like the tapas style food, so you can taste a little bit of everything without the huge portions and not waste any food. We were in food heaven. Some of our faves were the prime rib, fried chicken, pork butt, ceviche, poke, kale quinoa salad and of course their assortment of yummy desserts - chocolate covered strawberries dipped in oreo or candy bar crumbs, warm chocolate lava cake, different flavors of gelato and more. Wicked Spoon is definitely our favorite buffet in Las Vegas.
Pros: Aesthetically pleasing food, nice salad island, great servers. Cons: Food is variable in terms of taste and consistency, desserts were not very good. . My family and I came to the Wicked Spoon very excited and with high expectations. I remember seeing the Wicked Spoon on the travel channel's buffet paradise and of course I was very excited to finally being able to try it. We came on a Tuesday night around 6:30 pm and were lucky to not encounter a very long line. The wait was about 30 minutes total before we could start tasting the amazing looking dishes. Once set free, I immediately set off to try the salad bar. I was blown away by all the items available and surprisingly, everything was delicious! I loved all of the salads they had. They were all delicious. I moved onto the entrees afterwards and there were many different things to choose from. I was particularly drawn to the cute little serving skillets for many dishes and also the little frying basket for the chicken and waffles. You would probably be better off sampling around before diving in. I took a couple of photos of my plates and the majority of the items were very good, except for the dry chicken of the chicken and waffles and the not so great desserts. After I devoured plates and plates of food, the dessert frontier was the only thing left to explore. It is a small island off on the right corner of the room and I would say that only the gelato was worth going back for. Every other dessert, except the strawberries and gelato, can be passed. . . I can't say that I did not enjoy my time in the Wicked Spoon because it was a very nice buffet with a nice atmosphere. Though the lighting at the tables were a little dim, the bathroom is very nice and clean, and the food islands are always full of food for you to grab. Dinner for $38 sounds a lot, but in comparison to the Bacchanal, I would prefer to come back to the Wicked Spoon over Bacchanal.
The theme of this place is cute. I feel like it's best for those that wants a taste of everything but does not want to finish a whole serving. Everything is served on a tiny displayed dish. Very cute. The variety is just enough. Skip the Asian food area and desserts. I literally took one bite and couldn't continue for both those areas. I stuck with the seafood options. It's located all the way in the back of Cosmo. We thought the place would be packed so we went early. By the time we finished (around 7?) it was still fairly empty. So I guess it's a hit or miss.
Interior was designed quite upscale. Not matching the quality of food. Worst food in Vegas. Dry, simple, over cooked, like the old days in Reno. Sushi bar has shut down and they just put some over cooked items spread over the empties stations. No wait staffs to pick up used plates. Employees all looked unhappy. Must be low paid. . . The server at the prime ribs station was so low class, he checks out all the girls before serving the portions. How can such a nice hotel restaurant image have such low class service. Management are not doing their job. . . All the good photos from yelp site were earlier grand opening days. We had 8 people at over $50 / person totaling of $400. We can get much better food from any other restaurant or buffets. Don't fall for it or you will truly regret.
I had breakfast, and didn't eat much. Enough said. I thought this was a high end casino, but it falls short big time in this joint!
I came here on New Years Day this year with some girlfriends after a long night of going out. This, we learned, was a bad idea. . . We were stoked and heard great things about Wicked Spoon being a must-go-to spot in Vegas. For a holiday, the wait wasn't bad at all (maybe 10 minutes)! Our waiter was super enthusiastic and great. The restaurant is very nicely decorated inside; has that upscale Vegas, bright lights thing going on. . . Food was just okay in my opinion. I tried pretty much everything from all the sections they had. I would say everything is presented very nicely, but the taste was just average. But I was not quick to judge because the dessert area looked awesome. Then, I was slightly disappointed when I tried a couple of the pastries and gelato. Pretty plane and like any other chocolate mousse and pistachio gelato you could find. I guess I had high expectations because I paid a good chunk of money for this buffet. . . I will give it another chance next time I am in Vegas though, because our group was super tired from the night before. We basically all fell asleep at the table after we ate. I can't tell if it was food coma-ing or just being super dead from the night before.. . Overall: Wicked Spoon, you disappointed me, especially on a holiday. I expected more. Also, the prices are hiked up during holidays...no fun. Maybe I'll get the unlimited mimosas next time for the additional money and make it a boozy brunch. Technically if you pay $40 for brunch and have about 8-9 mimosas, they're only $4-$5 each, in addition to the food! THAT would make my meal worth it. :)
We did the lunch buffet and it was great! Spent maybe 3 hours there. Ate nice and slow. They had a great spread ranging most food categorizes. Dessert area almost every thing you can think of. . . We also got the bottomless Mimosas for an extra $12. This was great deal and we defiantly put it to use!
came here during 4th of july weekend and had an early dinner before the crowd. . we were actually planning on going to bacchanal, but when we called, they said the wait was at least 2 hours...and this was at 3:30pm.... so since we already had bacchanal previously, we wanted to try wicked spoon because this one we have not been to. . . the food here is good, very neat, clean, individualized portions. however, the selection is not that great, they lack the las vegas seafood smorgasboard that most other buffets provide. the shrimp cocktail, while the shrimpp are very large and plump, are rationed into 2 piece portions with cocktail sauce atop in a shot glass.... . i think i expected a bit too much, or maybe my memory of the awesome buffet at bacchanal raised my standards for a vegas buffet, and wicked spoon just wasnt sufficient enough.
Absolute garbage. This is a glorifide Hometown buffet at 5 times the cost. Everything is cold and nothing is fresh. trashy looking tacos, ice cold fried chicken, empty burned out soup pots, cheap crap pastry, cold cold prime rib, cheap crap salads. What a bunch of idiots must be running this chithole. you charge 40 bucks for a buffet and have only one soup option? Also, your one soup pot was dried out and empty while your idiot workers were chatting or just walking around. this place is so crappy there are no words to describe it.
This is one of the worst places I have ever eaten. I am baffled by the fact that it has the same number of stars as bacchanal in ceasers. From the time we got in line to pay until the end, this has been a complete disaster. Food that I am watching the cooks set out tastes a week old. The crab tastes the least fresh of any other buffet in Vegas. The variety sucks. You have to hunt for a plate, because they apparently don't have enough. We were more than half way through our meal when somebody finally came to take our drink order, so luckily there was some crappy, warm water in bottles sitting on the tables already. But hey, if you're into desserts that look pretty and don't taste good, and terrible service than this is the place for you.
Great food !. I like it better than Bellagio and Wynn, while the food quality and selection can't beat the Bacchanal, but the price is much cheaper with much less wait in the line, defintelyworth a try !
Wicked Spoon does not compare to Paris, Bellagio, Wynn, or Studio B buffets.  Even the buffet at Riveria hotel is better. $40 per person you get a terrible selection, salty food, and no champagne. Now I know why there was no line.
Enjoyed most of the food.  A few things were not for me but someone else might like o. Four stars because it was $30 for breakfast .
This buffet definitely deserves the accolades it's been getting over the years.. . In all my visits here the past few years, I've noticed that the quality has been maintained, which is good.  What's good about this place is that they offer a terrific variety of dishes and don't just rely on the old standards like crab legs and prime rib to keep customers happy.. . Some notable dishes - the tuna poke appetizer was great and the meat section (prime rib, sausages, pork etc.) was impressive.  I wasn't as thrilled about the Asian section as the food there didn't taste as good as the other selections.. . I am a huge fan of the dessert section here and would argue that it was the best among all the buffets I visited on this particular trip (compared to the Caesars and Wynn buffets).  The Thai iced tea ice cream was pretty awesome, and the white chocolate mousse was excellent as well.  I ended up enjoying dessert more than any part of my meal which is unusual for me in a buffet.. . If you only have time to hit up one buffet, this isn't a bad choice.  The ambiance here is also more like a restaurant than a buffet, which is nice.
Wicked Spoon, praised by the WSJ as perhaps one of the best restaurants in the United States, glorified by the food connoisseur. For a $38 dinner on a weeknight, and to celebrate AP scores along with the end of a family vacation at Zion and Bryce national parks, my family trekked out to the Cosmopolitan ultimately for one purpose: to eat at Gerald Chin's pricey yet exquisite buffet. . . To start off, the wait isn't bad on a weekday, at least when I went. We got there at around 4:30 (it opens at 5), and there was absolutely nobody in line. We strolled around the Cosmopolitan and came back at around 4:45, we were first in line, and about thirty seconds after we started waiting, a pretty sizable line started forming -- a line that was, however, nothing compared to the capacity that the buffet could have held. Long story short and to be concise -- if you do enter and there seems to be like a big line, don't worry, the restaurant can hold a lot of people, and you'll get your spot. Keep in mind as a disclaimer that this was on a Monday night, so this probably doesn't apply to the weekends. . . We were seated and our server immediately provided us drinks. As a tip, make sure that when you start to get your food to start from the left -- it goes from appetizer, to seafood, to meat, to speciality dishes, to pizza, to Asian, and finally, to dessert. Some recommendations: . . Appetizer -- Waldorf salad with green apples was delicious. Great way to clean up your palate before you start eating and very refreshing. Eating at a buffet is very filling, so I would recommend to get one of these after every plate to clean up your palate and just eat something very refreshing. Also tried the Poke Salad which was pretty good (especially enjoyed the crispy rice balls), along with the lime-sriracha watermelon which was interesting but nothing to write home about. . . Main courses -- I'm normally hesitant to try out anything Asian at a buffet, but I decided to go for it because Gerald Chin is, after all, Chinese. To be concise, pass on it. The beef with broccoli was extremely salty, the pork fried rice was just like normal fried rice, the teriyaki was good, and yakisoba was ok, and overall, the asian section was just okay. Pass on it. Best thing to get here is no question the fried chicken. I don't know if it's the unique curry in the batter but overall the chicken was not soggy and was wonderfully, delightfully, divinely crispy. Get it. Pass on the risotto, but definitely go for the wonderful crab legs. . . Dessert -- Gelato bar was awesome, but the gelato wasn't quite frozen enough to the right gelato consistency. Go for the white chocolate mocha gelato, which is absolutely divine, and the Thai Tea, with an interesting yet refreshing flavor. Strawberries good, and the cone with apricot cream was phenomenal. Pass on the lava cake. . . I really want to give Wicked Spoon a 4, because of the experience -- but at the end of the day the food was really just A-OK. I would say despite the price, hop on down for the experience, because it's unquestionably worth it for just that. . . Food: 23 | Service: 26 | Decor: 27
Nope nope nope!. . Ate at 6pm, waited in line to pay, waited in line to get seated then waited in line to serve myself. No thank you!. . A bunch of mediocre food at $41 a pop.. . They must use preservatives because I got sick after eating there (because I'm allergic to fake preservatives).. . Overall a huge waste of time & money'
We chose to eat here based on Yelp comments.  I don't know what happened, but we give The Wicked Spoon two thumbs down.  Their website advertises the lunch buffet until 3PM.  We arrived at 1:45PM.  We were informed that the buffet would close at 2PM and given the option of dining or not.  We elected to dine even with the time limit caveat.   Well, knowing we were on a strict time constraint, the cashier (Maria) didn't hesitate to collect our payment, but failed to seat us immediately.  When questioned about being seated, she informed us that we needed to wait for a hostess.  Well Maria  would not call a hostess over to seat us.  She opted to let 5 paying customers wait rather than seeing that we were seated!  Totally unforgiveable and negligent on her part.  Instead of seeing that a hostess was called over to the cashier station to seat us, she opted to chit chat with another employee and complain about us loud enough that we could hear her.  Maria needs to be trained on proper employee etiquette.. . A gentleman in the group behind us, finally called a server over, who immediately sat us.  Because you see, a hostess never showed up to seat us!. . When were finally able to partake of the buffett, we were disappointed.  The poor service we received at the Cashier Station would have been dismissed if the food selection on the buffet was tasty. There's a variety of food to select from, but I've had way better tasting food elsewhere.  . . The wait staff was very accommodating, professional and pleasant.  But, even with the wait staff, we were told the buffet line was going to close at 2:15.  Another staffer came to our table and said the line was closing at 2:30.  The didn't need to worry about keeping the line open, the food wasn't worth eating.  . . I'd say pass on The Wicked Spoon and go somewhere else.  This place is all hype and doesn't deliver.
As lunch can be rather... leisurely in Las Vegas, we showed up at 1:45, which gave us just enough time to gorge before they closed at 2:30pm. It's tucked in the back of the second floor of the Cosmopolitan. . . I'll be honest, I'm not well-versed in the Vegas buffet scene, but I had heard good things about Wicked Spoon, and I wasn't quite willing to shell out the premium to go try Bacchanal. At $30 (including tax) for the lunch buffet (no booze), I thought it was a good deal. . . All the individual pots of pasta were tasty, and very rich and cheesy. The "Chinese" five-spiced pork belly was tasty, as was the little takeout container of pork belly fried rice. (I love rice!) There were definitely some decadent touches, including a massive pile of bone marrow bones, with a dish of fleur du sel right next to it. There wasn't anything I had that was below par, which I always consider a success in a buffet. . . What was the star? . . For me, it was the lobster mashed potatoes, made with lobster roe. There was just something so decadent and rich, I really couldn't get enough. . . Desserts were good, including chocolate-covered strawberries and gelato. The rhum al baba was delicious (it's surprising how many places make the pastry so heavy!) and there were plenty of gluten-free and sugar-free options, if that's your thing (I eat all the things).
I love love love this place! I came here with a bunch of friends while visiting Las Vegas and assumed it would be like any other casino buffet, I was wrong. The food was amazing, nothing was dry or undercooked. The  individualized portions were great. As someone who has frequented many casinos in the Atlantic City area, I did not have high hopes, but now this place has set the bar so high! The Mac and cheese was amazing and came in it's own little pot. They serve alcohol by the bottle, which is new to me, so that was a plus for my group. I tried the bone marrow, also delicious. The staff was quick and polite, definitely go for dinner. You won't be disappointed by this place! Just be wary that there will be a line, but that's because the secrets out, they're amazing!
great food. not too much selections tho.. but overall good experience
We walked up at 7:30pm... there is no line.  Really?  This must be our lucky day.  I didn't have to wait an hour and a half for a Vegas buffet?  . . Well, I found out why there was no line.  The food is crappy, that's why.. . Crab legs are skinny, frozen, and full of freeze burn.  Other food was just nothing to mesmerized over.  . . Did I see cup cake on the dessert bar?  Cheap!  . . What save the night of disappointment dining option was a Scottish (may be Irish) chef who stood there and slowly chugging the oyster for us.   He was entertaining and friendly.  The oyster was fresh and tasty.  But I was told that the oyster was not on "regular" menu.  I gave two stars instead of one, because of the chef and his great attitude.  . . Don't waste your gambling time/ money here people.
If you go to Las Vegas, this is the must go to buffett...friendly service, fresh food, nice environment, tons of food options, good price for the great quality of food. If you go during brunch dont go for the typical omelette or eggs and bacon. Try all the other options they have. It's the best!!
Short Sum: May not be perfect but still great for an upscale all you can eat Vegas meal.. . Pros: . - Hits the mark for most of the foods and set up. Most of the foods have already been placed in small platters for you to grab. . - Agree with one of the reviews below me. Very aesthetically pleasing food and interior. Definitely one of the better looking buffets in Vegas. . - Dessert is amazing. There's a gelato bar and the servers are always nice. You can always get two or more at a time. . - Our waiter was extremellyyyy nice. A star for him. . . Cons: . - Misses the mark on some foods. Kind of expected from the buffet. The fried rice was poorly made. Fried chicken wings were too salty. I asked for medium steak and I felt like mine was pretty damn rare still. . - Buffet is pretty damn hard to find...or pretty hidden at least. . . Go Back? . - I'll probably hold Wicked Spoon off next time I go to Vegas. Going to try other buffets and compare.
A few things I really enjoyed, Actually they are the only things. . . They had great Gelato. Awesome Mac & Cheese Bar. Yummy Macaroons
Visited Wicked spoon today (Wed. July 30, 2014) for dinner for the first time and here is the breakdown:. . Staff: Super nice and helpful, they took time to explain in details all the food ingredients because my wife has severe food allergies.. . The food: Really expected the food to be much better than what it was! for the most part everything was bland, overcooked, cold (when it had to be warm) or warm (when it had to be chilled), weirdly spiced or tough.. . Sushi was not that good, salads where ok, the Prime rib was good (only if you get a freshly cut piece), roasted pork not good, roasted lamb, so so...chicken, nothing special... , the rest of the stuff was mediocre at best.. . The Deserts: I am not a desert guy but the deserts where nice and fresh.. . Summary: for the dinner priced at $38+tax, it is definitely overpriced. There is not much variety and the quality was not there. The food station where somewhat messy and dirty because all these little plates they use to individually serve the foods keep moving all over your plate and fall all over. overall, for the money you can get much much better in Vegas so I wouldn't recommend Wicked Spoon. Maybe if it was in the $25 price range for dinner, I would give it another shot.
Loved it. We went there around 6 pm on a Thursday and did not have to wait in line at all. The desserts were great. I think the food was more rich than Bacchanal but the Bacchanal has more selections. The ice cream/ gelato was amazing. I like how you can order your on mac and cheese. Also, the pizza was awesome. It does not taste like those other crappy pizzas you get from other buffets. I also recommend trying the mashed potatoes. Also, good service!
