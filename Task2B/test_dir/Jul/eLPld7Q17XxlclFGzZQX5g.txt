I went there this afternoon for lunch and usually this place is fairly good and one of my favorites.. . BUT they had some serious electrical issues and the restaurant was closed for a few days.  Today when we went, 2 of us got food poisoning and got extremely sick.  literally bedridden w diarrhea etc.  . . The fish/food etc. is NOT fresh so DO NOT EAT. . I called and the owner solution was for me to go to the hospital and bring them a doctors note to prove it which I will.  sort of an odd response to a customer being sick but just wanted everyone to be careful!!!!!
I used to love this place, but over time the service has gotten horrible.  I have waited for 2hrs and only placed one order...the 2nd order appeared be another long wait....I am writing this as a wait for my masago(been 40min). This is the third time I experience (back to back) extreme long waits when it's not "out of the ordinary" busy.  It's time for me to call it quites and look for a different place.
Nothing special here. I was going to give this place 3 star, because I eat there once.  Unfortunately I can't. Reason: I walked in with my 21 years old daughter. Ugly girl at door said 45 minutes to wait. I believed her that's why we wait. After 3 minutes guy walked in she found a table for him. I couldn't believe it. I go to her I said you told me wait 45 minutes at that time other girl came up to us now this hostess start lying telling me " I was going to seat you " I said NO you told me 45 minutes and you were seating other who walked in after us" Very bad customer service. I will never go back there again food doesn't taste that special anyways
Forget the pricey buffets at the big name hotels. Come to Yama Sushi for the best buffet deal in town. It's only $21 for lunch and $23 for dinner for AYCE sushi. Unlike most AYCE sushi joints, Yama offers uni, hamachi kama, sweet shrimp, etc. (limit 1 plate per person for most). There's almost never a wait, and the sushi quality is decent for what you're paying. . . There's several items that I always get. The uni is a coin flip, but I've had pretty good tastings recently. I like the sweet shrimp, but I'm not a fan of the fried variety that accompanies it. The hamachi kama is huge and is sure to fill you up. My favorite roll to order is the wet dream, which comes as a baked cali roll with shrimp, cream cheese, and finished with sweet yam sauce. I always end with an order of white tuna nigiri (buttery goodness). . . If you don't like rice, start with the seafood salad, which is a poor man's chirashi bowl. Skip the soft shell crab, which is too fried for my liking. Lastly, save room for dessert as you can order ice cream mochi and two scoops of ice cream. The mango mochi is fantastic and I'm a big fan of the green tea and plum ice creams.
All I can say is average sushi. Very bland flavors, too much rice, and the nigiri was well below average. Service was crappy as well. Our group got there at 250pm during lunch hours and they tried to charge us fordinner hours when it clearly says on thier menu that the price switch starts at 3pm. Very dissapointed again. That was my last visit ever.
I came here to celebrate my mothers bday and I must say it wasnt bad. First of all the wait to be seated was pretty long 45 mins,but I was expecting since I heard it was one of the best sushi places in town. As soon as we were seated, our server went over the "instructions" on how AYCE works...hmmm I guess. . . The actual sushi was sooo delish! I had so much that I lost count after the second plate. Our server was as attentive as she could be since it was a pretty busy night. . . Im not a patient person, so the long wait makes this 4 stars.... but still a must go. I WILL DEFINATELY GO BACK!
AYCE. Nigiri, sashimi, rolls, appetizers, desserts... seriously?!. It's real people.. They even have UNI. And SOFT SHELLED CRAB.. . We ate until we were ready to EXPLODE. Fish quality was good, not spectacular. They ran out of uni, so I was bummed, but the dishes were ordered made up for it.. . The seafood salad - not creamy - was a great start. Chunks of salmon, tuna, snapper dressed with a very addictive rice wine vinaigrette and shredded turnip.. . Mackeral was good. I love it despite its oily fishiness. It's one of my favorite textures to eat.. . Service was fast and friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to groups because you can share and eat a crapton of different items.. . The restaurant is small and fills up really fast, but we were seated within 5 minutes.
All-you-can-eat sushi restaurants are now a staple anytime we visit Las Vegas. We normally hit Oyshi sushi but this time we wanted to find a spot closer to The Strip. Once again, our fellow Yelpers helped us out and didn't fail to direct us to a good place to eat! For a Friday night, the wait seemed to be pretty typical - 30-45 mins. It was definitely worth it as our party of three was seated right at the sushi station. The sushi chefs in the back room (failed to get their names) gave us personalized attention and served up some awesome sushi! I recommend the My Cash, Double Dragon, and Strip Tease of you're a big specialty roll person. The seafood salad and sexy salmon are also secret gems on the menu.  The space in the restaurant was a little cramped which is probably the only drawback. This will probably be added to the AYCE list for future visits to Vegas.
I passed on ayce and am glad I did. The fish was not fresh to the point that it tasted rubbery. . . I've been to other sushi spots that were much cheaper, higher quality, and better prepared sushi than this place.. . Service was not good as well. The servers were not friendly and looked miserable to be there.. . I gave this place 2 tries and have been sorely disappointed. Will not return and highly do not recommend this sushi spot.
One of the best AYCE sushi i've tried so far. But I wasn't satisfied with the dessert. It would be great if they would not limit the ice cream order per person. Or at least allow per person to order the mochi ice cream 3 times the most just so that we can enjoy a variety of flavors.
UPDATE 7/16/2014: I'm still a huge fan of this place.  The rolls are delicious, and are still my favorite rolls in Vegas.  Unfortunately, I've downgraded my review because the last number of times that I have been here, the rolls have been drenched in the spicy mayo sauce.  Don't get me wrong, I like the sauce, but they have been putting WAY TOO MUCH on the rolls as of late. I often find myself scraping goops of mayo off of my sushi before I eat it now.  Hopefully this changes.
Our friends raved about this place for months, kept telling us it was one of the best sushi restaurants out here in Vegas - only problem was the ridiculous line to get in. We finally made our way there and tried the AYCE, and all I can say was it was only alright. Pros: the menu for AYCE had a LOT of items to choose from, so that was awesome. We went with a large party - all ordering AYCE - so we basically got to try every roll there. The Seafood Salad was pretty good. Cons: A lot of the rolls were very similar in taste, so nothing stood out as exceptional. . . Probably won't make any special trip to eat here again, but otherwise, not bad.
I found this place on yelp and was not disappointed! Excellent! Thank you yelpers for recommending this place and for the advice on ordering. The all you can eat (ayce) was a great choice. Be sure to ask for half orders otherwise you will get full quick and not be able to try as much.
This place is hella busy! I really dunno what all the hype is about this place.   It seems like a any other sushi restaurant.  The food was good, service was ok... but nothing really stood out to me.  If I lived on the east side of town, then I would hit this up again,  but I wouldn't drive out of my way to come here.  There are lots of sushi places on the west side that offer the same taste in sushi.  . . Overall, food was good.  If your near it, then eat there.  You'll enjoy yourself.  If not, don't drive out of your way.  I'm sure there are other sushi places in your area just as good.
Good prices all around.  The area is a little dicey. Well worth the trip!! The sushi was right one point!! Swing by this gem.
My favorite sushi place in all of Las Vegas.  It's a must eat for locals and for visitors.
I only wished we had this exact same place in Orange County, CA!. . It's only a couple of minutes off thestrip and for $21/person for lunch, the price can't be beat for AYCE anywhere near the Vegas strip.  . . My husband and I sat at the sushi bar and ate more than our fair share of $21 worth of sushi, rolls, and appetizers.  The items we ate that I just LOVED included:. Sweet Shrimp (By far my FAVORITE place I've had sweet shrimp.  Perfect clear sweet after taste and the batter used to fry the head was not overwhelming and complimented the delicacy of the shrimp brains). Garlic tuna. Halibut. Tuna. Salmon. Baked mussels (one order contains 4 very small mussels). Soft-shelled crab. . They were very busy with a line out the door.  So expect average/sub par service.  Our waitress forgot a couple of items we ordered, but it didn't bother us.  It just left us more room for delicious sushi that came from the sushi chef since we sat at the sushi bar. . . I can't wait to go to Vegas again just so I can come here to eat again.
This was awesome!! So good !!  The service was great! My friends and I really enjoyed it!  Hard to find, it is in a strip mall
I love love love Yama. I don't get to go out for dinner as much as I did in my pre-children days, but my partner and I make it a point to visit Yama every couple of months. Food always tastes fresh, albeit a little heavy on the mayo sauces sometimes. Service is generally very fast and friendly. Avoid going between 5pm and 8pm--you will have a loooooong wait. Otherwise, I love it.
So I have been here before but now as Yama sushi has become so popular and big the sushi has 2x more rice than before and less fish, also the service has dropped to something impermissible, on too of the fact that they recently got a B- Health Inspection rating for 16 violations most of them being the fish not being kept at proper temperatures. Go somewhere else, or just make sure you get good service.
