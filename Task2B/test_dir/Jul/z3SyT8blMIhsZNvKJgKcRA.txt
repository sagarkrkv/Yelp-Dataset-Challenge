Everything about this trip was perfect hands down , on our hotel of course ceasars palace , we stayed on the augustus tower  I love how they have there own check in totally worth it no line perfect service they really treat you like royalty , I'm really speaking the truth I had a bellagio fountain view it's breathtaking and perfect , did I mention VIP parking too  I'm hoping to try the Octavius tower next trip, but all I have to say it's I had the best experience ever :)
We had a stopover and saw a show here while on a road trip.  My husband booked a room on Priceline because they take dogs.  He later found that the dog fee is an additional $75 per dog, per day.  He tried to cancel and had trouble so we kept the reservation.  The room was only $69 per night and the dog fee was more than that.  It was somewhat frustrating.  I am so happy that he was not able to cancel.  The room was luxurious and very spacious.  There were 2 comfy beds with nice bedding.  A floor to ceiling view of the strip and nice seating area were other perks of the room.  They delivered two dog dishes, treats, baggies, a mat and door tag(Dog Inside) shortly after our arrival.  They had a very small turf area for the dogs to relieve themselves.  It had an umbrella and a large water dish, it is hot in Vegas this time of year!  It was so nice andweird to be walking through a hotel/casino with two Boxers.  The hotel staff was very friendly and happy to see the dogs.  We had a great night and are refreshed and ready to get on the road.  I will definitely stay here again and I can bring my dogs!
Last time I'm staying at this hotel.  The wifi is not free and the gym is not free they charge $25 a day to use their gym.  This hotel doesn't compare to Venittian.  Don't waste your money to stay at this hotel.  Very poor customer service.
Casino only... one dealer skipped my action three times.  Next dealer couldn't remember the bets and quibble over $2, when he was in the wrong. Then he started touching chips like he was about to end the hand. Of course, reminding him I was still in the hand encouraged others to fold.  Same dealer short changed an all-in bet after a re-raise. I played for more than 2 hours and was never asked about drink service.  Horrible service! I really expected better.
The best place!. It was so fantastic! . The service was good and the room was nice and clean!. Thumbs up
The shopping area was a great place to seek AC and get out of the sun.  Theonly bad part that I didn't like about the shopping area was the escalator to the 3 floors.  Whoever designed it, purposely made you walk way around the other side past the other stores to entice you to buy something. . . The statue show over by the Cheesecake Factory is boring!  Don't waste your time.
Seriously I have never imagined myself joining yelp to write a review.. . DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL EVER!!!!!. I am a frequent Las Vegas traveller. I have been to several hotels on the strip. I try to use different hotel ever time I go to experience differently.. . This time, I chose Cesar's Palace because of their package deal with Celine Dion show and the room. When I made the reservation over the phone, they forced me to get an expensive room with an excuse of a package deal. When I asked them about the daily rate and the concert ticket price, they told me that they do not know the break down of the package. Yet, they told me to get a more expensive room... Duh. . Since the package deal was cheaper than getting their cheapest room and the concert tickets seperately, I agreed  to purchase the deal.. . So I arrived at 8am, found out the room was not ready. They told me they are highly occupied that I have to wait. GUESS WHAT??!! I WAITED FOR 8 HOURS!!!!! 8 F* HOURS! After a long tired trip, my family had no other place  to go but to stay in our car!!!! I took an alternative room with a single bed when I reserved for two queen beds because my family were too tired!!!! I asked for a free roller bed which they agreed. They said they would deliver immediately. HOWEVER "IMMEDIATELY" MEANT 3 HOURS AND 1 COMPLAINT CALL FOR CESARS PALACE!!!!!. . The best is yet to come; CELINE DION SHOW GOT CANCELLED WITOUT ANY NOTICE. They told me all tickets will be refunded. Since I purchased one of my 3 tickets with the front desk, the box office told me that I need to back to them. So on the following day, which was my check-out day, I told the front desk about the ticket refund as I was checking out. The front desk told me that I need to talk to box office, which I did. Then the box office told me to talk to the front desk again. None of them knew how to process the refund for 2 tickets purchased through package and 1 ticket purchased at the front desk.. . Back at the front desk, I asked to this one representative for the break down of my package deal. Then he gave me another copy of the room use summary which I received as I checked out. I asked him to give me the breakdown of the package again however he doesn't understand again. Instead he ORDERS me to listen to him that he is going to explain all. Then he starts to explain the room usage break down doing simple mathematics as he is a teacher. How arrogant and  stupid.. . That's when I got just furious!!! Not only he is not understanding, he was too arrogant!!!! Every time I tried to ask for what I wanted, he would just order me to listen. When my volume raised up little bit, he orders me to quite down that if not, he would call the security. I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE AT A HIGH-END HOTEL THREATENING THEIR CUSTOMER!!!!!. . Here is my recommendation to all of you looking to purchase a package deal from Caesars. JUST WISH THAT YOUR RESERVED SHOW WILL BE ON AIR OTHERWISE YOU JUST HAVE LOST YOUR HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS!!!!!
This weekend was the second time I had stayed at Caesar's in the space of a month. I am a total rewards member and I go to Vegas about 5 or 6 times a year. I think the whole hotel is quite nice and the service is decent except for the front desk! . . On my earlier stay about three weeks ago I hadgone to speak to someone at reception to make sure I wasn't being double charged for the resort fees and the man at reception who was actually quite polite had called over his supervisor to answer the question as he was unsure. He was completely rude to me and I had to walk away because I was just shocked at the attitude of a "supervisor".. . So on my most recent stay I was staying in the Augustus tower and when I had checked in I had asked for a room facing the Bellagio. No problem so far.... My wife and I get up to the room and we can't get in and the room was facing the wrong side. I went downstairs got in the huge line again and was then told several times by the gentleman at reception that it was probably because I had put the room card by my phone to which I replied that cannot be the case as I was holding it the whole time. He was having none of it and making out like I was lying. Once he checked the card he realized that they had actually put in the wrong room number on the card and it was there mistake. When I asked to get moved to a Bellagio facing room I was told it was not possible as I had checked in 2 hours ago..... hmmmm strange... All I had done was walk to the room and back and I was being told I had been there for two hours. I tried to explain that was not the case to which he said he would "call" to ask. . . No idea who he would need to call, I am sure that is something they can checl on the the computer screen but he said no. . . The rest of my stay was fine and I think the hotel has everything you can want but the fact the people at reception are so rude just starts your trip on a bad note.
Overall I'd say Caesar's is a nice resort and casino. The staff is friendly and the casino is clean and not smoky. The shopping is high end if that's what you're looking for and plenty of it.. The only negative is the room we were given. We we're in Roman Tower which is the oldest and you can tell. Even in a suite room we had carpet that was stained and about 20 years old. The furniture was a mix of the last 3 decades and the mattress was worn out and springy. It definitely needs some updating for being a top tier Vegas resort. We had two staff members who said they had never been in our room before. I think it's time management visits the 6th floor at least.
NEVER take to upgrade offer - They cheat on you to get away.... . We booked 4 Deluxe rooms with 2 queen beds in Augustus Tower and check-in at 4:00PM.. We have 3 room ready but only with 1 queen bed and they roll in extra single bed.. The last on they want us to wait for 1 hour and will be upgraded to the "Suite" in the Forum Tower, we are so excited so we accept the offer. After 1 hour without getting any call from them, we come to the reception and get the key to the Forum Tower. We did not expect that they cheat us so we just take the key and roll our luggage all the way to the Forum Tower. Get in and very surprise that the room is very small with the low ceiling and call the receptionist right away. They roll in the single bed but there is no room for us to move around after getting that extra bed in.. . Call the receptionist and their answer get us upset: "We guaranty you to have a room to stay but at the moment we have no other room to exchange and may be... tomorrow we will give you another room." We check the hotel website and see that we did pay higher for the Augustus room with 2 beds ($20.00 more than the Augustus room with 1 bed) and we get the cheapest room in Forum ($100.00 less than what we pay). Ask to talk to the manager but no one is available.... . Roll our luggage back the registration area and waiting for another hour then they finally give us the Octavius room with 2 beds after we just stand there complaining to them. We did get the room after 3hours 30 minutes and all our plan had to be changed.... . We are all tired waiting...and definitely think again when we want to book anything at Caesar Palace in the future.
Drinks are overpriced.  I wouldn't mind paying $11 for a small bloody Mary if it was decent, but it was not even decent /: came to try and have bacchanal buffet, but the wait was 3.5 hrs.  That's outrageous.  Forget it.. And my bf and I hate the layout of the casino.  It's confusing.
kind hard to parking in holidays
Pros: Excellent staff service, strip location, cleanliness.. Cons: Mattresses are what you'd expect to find in a cheap hotel.. . Third time in Vegas, first at Caesers. Booked non-smoking, gave us smoking and room had a hole in the wall. Eh. Staff was very courteous, hotel was clean. Doesn't seem like  large casino compared to the other hotels. They say they give you free wifi, but when you try to sign in, you see there's a charge to your room (=confusing), didn't end up using it . Tried food at Central - excellent, Bacchanal buffet: over-priced and over-rated. Can't say I'd re-book there.
Ill give it a couple of stars do to the fact there is alot to do HOWEVER . . We valet parked ( taking parents to ramsays. ) closer to the planet Hollywood area and not alot of sign age direction to casino we got lost about 4 times and was about ready to head out. While yes there is a directory they need to change the sign color or something either have the business in side the casino separate plaque or have single Large signs directing  you to the casino.. . Also the casino floor layout is bad -- i.e 1 $ 2$ slot games mixed in with 25 cent and penny slots, and then realizing after you go past the pus.cat doll poker room or what ever that was that there is a complete penny room adjacent from the exit room. . . We nearly walked to whole back side of that casino and ramsay's is tucked all the way in the back we where thinking about going to another restaurant due to the fact. . . Me personally I wont be back the casino floor was really tight on a Friday -- I didn't win nothing not even a dickie bird ha. . . Get some better signage and also they need to work on there floor cleaning pick up I saw alot of beer bottles, plastic cups, etc. overall impression was meh. If I wanted to go old school I would stay in Fremont.
I've always enjoy staying at Caesars in the Augustus tower.  The rooms are spacious with a beautiful view.. . The Venus pool is great, live DJ, great drinks and food.. . The Forum shop is great for the non- gambler.  Great shops for shoppers!  Nice restaurant to dine at.  . . The hotel display the roman goddesses, great picture setting.  . . One of my fav hotel to stay at.
Very beautiful resort filled with roman statues, fountains, columns, etc. The architecture is beautiful and I was very impressed with the curving escalators. There's lots to do in here and there is a little bit for everyone (shopping, restaurants,   etc) to enjoy.
This review is only for the valet parking service at caesar's palace. I left my car with the valet parking service. The guy who took my car seemed ok. The Asian girl who brought me my car has no business being a valet. I drive a 2013 Toyota Prius which is one of the most common cars on the road. She screeched my tires and said she couldn't find my brakes. A Toyota Prius is so common. She acted like she's never seen or driven one before. If that's the case, Caesar's should train their valets or give a basic test when hiring valets. When I drove off, I noticed the incompetent valet popped open my hood.
Not a fan of this hotel except the buffet and the Forum Shops. Staff unfriendly, rooms old, plumbing problems and bad atmosphere. . Can't understand why people would stay here instead of the Bellagio.
I love this casino. We went there to gamble and it was so much fun. I don't know when you walk in it just feels different. Next time I will stay there.
The room or pretty decent, but their WiFi policy is INSANE.  $25/day PER device.  I sucked it up and paid for my work laptop, and then determined it was $25 more for my iPad and $25 more for iPhone.  Absolutely ridiculous.
Das Hotel ist auerlich und in der Lobby beeindruckend. Die Zimmer sind grozugig, wenn gleich sie schon bessere Tage erlebt hatten. Die Poolanlage ist riesig. Das Personal ist freundlich. Das Gepack wird einem aufs Zimmer gebracht. Wir konnten auch kostenlos parken. Standesgema wird das Auto weggebracht und geholt. Alles in allem ein sehenswertes Hotel. Wir fanden auch das Preis-/Leistungsverhaltnis okay. Allerdings hat die Dusche nach einmal Duschen den Geist aufgegeben. Gott sei Dank war ich nicht mehr eingeseift. In der Badewanne ging dafur nur heies Wasser.
Fabulous!! One can spend their entire trip in this hotel without ever venturing out in the heat. The decor is impeccable, the service is 5 stars, pools are numerous and elegant and restaurants are top notch. Whatever your craving or desires to fulfill any one of the 7 deadly sins - this is the hotel!! . PS - also good for kids
A year later... Unreturned phone calls and count less voicemails.  Only 15% of the cost of my stolen watch has been recovered.  I'm still shocked at what a scam this hotel and spa is.  Oh, they did comp my massage. After all, I was being robbed while getting it.  Which I had to ask for btw.. . BEWARE!!!  While getting a massage, a spa attendant broke in to my locker and stole my $4,500 Baume & Mercier watch. I've learned from other people that their staff targets people all the time and robs them. Finally a third party company gave me $700, hardly enough for a watch that cost $4,500. Caesars and their management could care less.
I never stayed at the hotel, but I did visit. The shopping mall is out of this world. It is definitely on my to-do list.
Caesars is world class. Gorgeous, spacious, clean rooms. A variety of exceptional dining options. Forum Shops to get your spend on. Venus pool is top notch--stiff drinks, great music, and beautiful ladies letting their girls breathe. Central strip location can't be beat and the casino speaks for itself. I'll only stay at Caesars, Bellagio, or Cosmo.. . Addressing some of the ridiculous negative reviews...sounds like a lot of poors overshot their spending capabilities. Yeah, if you stay in the Roman Tower it is going to be dated. That's why your rate was cheap. Packages? Please. Be lucky you aren't in Excalibur, NYNY, or the Motel Six where you belong. Get a suite, stay in Augustus or Octavious, and stop whining. This is Vegas, not Make-a-Wish. And the slip and falls...no one gives a crap. Who is Yelping and thinking "hmm...I wonder where Caesars farms out its insurance liability for slip & falls?" No one. That's who.. . If you have money and like nice things, Caesars is for you. If you're a poor and booked some sort of package deal or got a $150 rate in the Roman Tower and think you're in The Hangover, you get what you deserve.
***Best location, best value and had FUN!!!***. I have been to quite a few hotels on the strip, but felt I got more for my dollar at Caesar's Place!  I automatically got an upgrade because my daughter was celebrating her 21st birthday and so we went from the forum tower to the palace tower (room 2216) and had a wonderful view of the pools (Garden of the Gods) and mountains.  . . From the palace tower elevators is the pool entrance and enjoyed the easy cabana layout.  They do have a topless pool which is the longer pool by the Palace tower.  The pool environment was wonderful for all ages!. . The first stop was Payard Patisserie and Bistro, where every 15 minutes a chocolate comes out of the machine that was delicious!  There was also Serendipity3 which has the old fashion "drugstore" sundaes...strong suggestion, try it!!! Yum!!!. . I didn't get to see any entertainment but as of July 2014, there is Celine Dion, Shania Twain (which has her own store) Rod Stewart and my favorite Elton John!. . The only bar I sat down was the Seahorse lounge, it was an experience to drink by the big circular fish tank with the vibrant colors!. . Another go to place is the "Forum Shops" that takes you through all the beautiful stores and of course the entertainment with the statues.  This is where everyone seems to like to hang out besides the casino!!. . If you go by the parking lot elevators, there you will see some of the "Hangover" movie memorabilia, which always gives me a giggle to ask  "Does Caesar live here"? :). . The total rewards system is great, it can follow you through out your casino experience as well as you can dine out at their other properties (which I did at Paris) and bill it to your room.  Bonus!!!. . My experience might be a little different than most, I stayed from Sunday to Monday night and used their discount deal from Facebook, so the weekend might run a little hectic, and more people want upgrades, you know the drill, but be patient, it is always worth it!!!
Very unprofessional to cancel a concert 30 mins before the show is about to start. Won't even comp anything for us even though we're out $1000 for the room,gas, and food to get here. Trying to get us to pay for another room for tomorrow nights show even though they know damn good and well that the show tomorrow will be cancelled tomorrow as well. We are very very disappointed.
Great hotel.   It has a delicious buffet and the hotel is conveniently located across from Bally's and Bellagio.  It has great shops as well to escape the heat during the day.
Caesars might have been poppin' once, but it's past it's prime now. We got our reservations from booking.com, which came out to be pretty cheap for 300/2 nights.. . Pros: . - 5 different pools! With a pretty cool and hidden dayclub. - a nice upgrade to the top floor with pool views for only 40 bucks. - Munchbar was delicious and they had areas for watching the Kings game. . . Cons: . - not the crowd we were looking for. Mostly older people . - the casino is lacking some games which we had to go to surrounding hotels for . - inattentive staff. The iron and MP3 player in our room weren't working so we gave them a call and they said they'll send replacements up. 3 hours later we called again and they said the same thing. Again. We didn't end up getting the replacements for another 2 hours. . . Bottom line : splurge and go stay at the Cosmo, Aria or Cromwell.
If you are looking for a place to stay, I would suggest this place! Have to admit, I am giving this place a decent rating because one, My girl pals and I got to stay here for free. Got to love how all her times at the tables has its perks! So we checked in here and it was actually a pretty quick process and after 9 hours in the car, I was quite relieved. .     Our room was clean, smelled decent, and we had an excellent view! We had 2 bathrooms that connected which , with 4 girls, is a PLUS. Our room was amazing and I was quite pleased of how well kept it was. Trust me, just because its a nicer hotel, doesn't mean its going to look its best all the time. Any ways, for the night life, this place is pretty packed. Only distaste is the constant smell of cigarette smoke and of course the creepy pervy old men. Strange but I guess normal in Vegas, we had people stop us and offer us free drinks at the bars/night life in the hotel since we were "good looking." Who can say no to free drinks? Well I would when a creepy old guy followed me for a good twenty minutes. Thought I would have to beat him with my heels if he got close enough. LOL. .    Lines for the club at the hotel are lonnnnnggg, however if you are a set of women, you will probably get in quick. (Sorry guys!!!) and there is constantly a flow of people wherever you go. Also people with crazy looking drinks just walking around. I def. liked the fact that there were plenty of places to walk to for food or just to check out and the taxi service was also excellent. Fun times!
First entering Cesar's palace was amazing. Check In was great - Garon upgrade our room (because they didn't have any double queens - they over booked themselves) and this was the start. My roommate and I had a great time in Vegas ate at Rao's. Great Italian food, but when we got back to our room...we didn't expect what was going to happen.. . It is 1:00AM in the morning. People are trying to get in our room. WHAT!!!. . 1:15 another person knocks on our door asking if we need a bed, no covered.... . 1:30 a family of three with security is trying to get in the room - if the deadbolt wasn't locked or we were out...what would have happened. SOOO Unsettling. . . We opened the door and they were shocked to see people were in it.. . 2:00AM Unsettling to leave we settled in for the night.. . Next morning - My credit card company sends me an e-mail saying my account was low...what? Cesar's put a $1318.88 hold on my account! ARE YOU KIDDING!!!! No one told us that. $1318.88!!!! Seriously. No one told us.. . Front desk was not helpful. I'm very disappointed. . . Mandalay Bay - Aria - Palazzo - Bellagio - Mirage - Even Stratosphere. I would choose these places over Cesar's. I'm so disappointed, I was so excited to stay there, don't think I will do that again.
We got to our room and it was a mess. The plugs didn't work and there was a bottle soda that someone left behind on the floor. No refrigerator, no coffee maker and no bed skirts so you could see the mattress. The shower gel seemed to be used and the lamp didn't work. I don't know it wasn't what I expected. Stay way from room 678.
Had a blast,  the  room was great, the service was great, the pool was great and although I have been to Vegas a number of times,  this trip by far was fab!. . Friends and family from Florida, Chicago, New York & Cal meeting up in sin city to have a sinful good time.. . I know I will go back, but not sure I will stay at Ceasars again, but it's not because of bad service, but because I like trying out different spots.
I lived that I got a good room rate, I understood that there were resort fees. I liked that there was online check-in. Here's the WARNING - don't accept the $25 early check-in. It's says they will notify you when the room is ready before you get there. I did not receive a notification. When I arrived at 2p I went to the desk and was told they had a room available. I asked if I was going to be charged for the early check-in from online and the guy said no. On checkout, it is on my bill. I called, explained and Javier said that's the way it is because I got the room before 4pm. No discussion, that's the rules. For $25 I won't be back here. Venetian is way better with guest services and a much fresher hotel.
I was so impressed w their buffet! Everything tasted amazing, their was so many different things to eat, we went for breakfast and lunch combined. They had a fresh seafood bar w real lobster and crab claws, shrimp n grits, chicken n waffles, red velvet pancakes, specialty French toast, 3 different kinds of bacon including turkey bacon, Mexican themed breakfast, a full cheese and meats selections, full area of Asian foods from steam buns, sashimi, and on and on!! Organic juices great customer service from the waiters and waitresses it was easy tip $20. Coming here will mandatory when coming to Vegas!!
So, I work a lot, and when I go on vacation (which is very rare) and spend my hard earned money.... the places where I spend my money should normally provide things that one expects when going on 'vacation'..... a normal vacation is a pleasurable experience, that's all.. . Our room was nice and we did get a free upgrade, which was really cool.  But that tells me that they are hurting for business and had an excess of rooms on a weekend.  Now I know why they had plenty of rooms on a weekend.. . I go to Vegas for the pool experiences, which at Caesar's is a total FAIL.  . . They have two pools right next to each other which both play different music.  In one ear you get crappy country music and in the other you get 3AM deep house.  Being at the pool at Caesars, felt like being torn in half by dueling lions in the Roman Coliseum.  Instead of providing towels when you enter, a strait jacket would be more appropriate, since that is what you will need when you leave.. . And the food ?  Two stale dry falafel wraps, two average tasting bloody Mary's and two tap waters... which took 45 mins to get.....  $78 .. So, basically while be tortured by nails on a chalk board, you get food that I wouldn't give to my dog .. and fork over $$$$ for it at the same time.. . And best of all, they already know there is a problem.!   When I politely asked about the music issue to the waitress, she said..' ya, good thing you are not sitting over there, closer between the two speakers... I don't know how those people do it over there'... she then put her finger to her head like a gun and went 'POW'.. . It's basically the classic example of how a corporate mentality has ruined Vegas and the right hand does not even know there is a left hand.  Different departments, directors, managers (located in Kansas, New York or whatever) all with TPS Reports and not one of them has come down to see or experience first-hand what they have created ...  let alone have the balls to do anything about it.  They don't have a clue that they are torturing their customers or spend the time to think through how to run a hotel and provide a pleasurable experience.. . NEXT.
first time staying here.. this is a nice hotel but they get one star because of all the bull crap we had to go through.. first of all.. it took a long time to check in.. they messed up on our reservations.. we were suppose to get a junior suite with a pull out.. once we got to the room.. it was pretty much a regular room.. we made due.. they also SAID! that they were going to switch our room the next day.. we did call in the morning and the room was of course not ready.. the only good thing was the bellhop.. kept me entertained while all this was getting sorted out.. also!!!! the valet guy did not give us a valet ticket which of course we didnt notice till we were going to check out.. oh yea also they told us valet was full when we got there without asking if we were checking in.. so we had to go all the way to the back.. and that valet guy told us that we should go back to the front. sigh!
So i'm not a person to write bad reviews but my experience this past weekend is warranted for a review.. . I've stayed here at Caesar's once before and had absolutely no issues and that's exactly why I chose to stay here again.. . First off I usually book my rooms online and never call to book my reservations but this time I decided to. the first person I spoke with said the room I wanted  was sold out and then gave me prices for the different rooms available. I told her i'd talk it over with my boyfriend & I would call back. Maybe 5 minutes later I speak to a different representative & she stated the information the previous rep gave me was invalid, & to make matters worse the prices I was quoted were had over $100 difference. In short I got the room I wanted at the price I was originally quoted. . . Upon check-in after receiving our room keys we went upstairs and opened the door and there were people's things in the room, so we had to go all the way back downstairs to fix the issue, come to find the lady who checked us in gave us the wrong room number. Then back upstairs we went.. . So like I said I've stayed here before & did not understand why OUR room had no door for the bathroom.. I mean I don't really need the privacy with my boyfriend but when it comes to using the restroom particularly #2 a door would have been nice.. . THEN, there was a dried blood like stain on the sheets. I mean I haven't had this bad of an experience even in a cheaper hotel or motel.. . AND no free Wi-Fi!!! are you kidding me, after a $28 resort fee per night you still can't offer that to your guests!?. . I did ask for late check out for all the inconveniences & they still couldn't give me that!. . Last thing that I didn't appreciate was that after we had spent $$ at places Caesar's owns the woman who checked us out gave us a coupon book we couldn't even use because we were leaving. Weren't they supposed to hand us that during check in?. . However the only thing I enjoyed here was room service. The food was great!. . Anyways it's not like I'm never gonna stay at a Caesar's entertainment property every again, but this experience sucked so bad!!
My husband and me stayed there for one night on my bday. At check in I asked the receptionist if they have special birthday deals for spa or anything else and he said no, but instead he upgraded our room to the suit with hot tub and said now there is no need to go to spa :) and that was absolutely free! We enjoyed our stay at Caesars palace. The pools are amazing. The hotel itself and casino are very beautiful! Lots of food places and fine shops. Next time will choose this hotel again.
I give Caesar's 4 stars because every time I come here I am always amazed at how beautiful the property is. The casino, exterior property, and Garden of the Gods pool area are IMHO, the most impressively designed of all the Vegas hotels. I mean the Cosmopolitan is awesome too, but I just love the Ancient Rome motif at Caesars. The Bacchanal Buffet is my favorite buffet in Vegas. I personally have always had great service from the staff and that is one reason why I keep coming back.  . . This last trip,  I stayed in a room in the Roman Tower. It was a small room but very clean. I was nervous at first because you could clearly see that the center of the mattress was noticeably sunken in.  Ultimately the mattress was still comfortable and I'm pretty picky when it comes to a mattress. The room clearly had a bathroom redesign at some point. It had a large roman tub and a huge shower as well as double sink. There was one annoyance though... The bathroom had no door separating it from the rest of the room. Now I don't know about you, but I like a lil privacy when I'm dumping. This is especially true in Vegas where copious amounts of alcohol and buffet food can add up to some pretty tragic dumps. LOL. I keep no secrets from my wife, who was staying with me, but I don't want her to keep the door open when she's dumping and I'm quite sure she feels the same way about me. For the love of God.... Caesars, when you remodel a bathroom, don't forget to put the freakin door back on.. . Other than that, my stay at Caesars was enjoyable yet again and I will be back.
Very cool place!
Stayed as Caesars Sunday and Monday of this week for business.  We checked in on Sunday early, upgraded to the palace tower so they waived the early check in fee.  Room looked clean, changed and we went to the pool.. . At the pool: ready to spend some $$ on drinks and food since work didn't start until Monday, took 3 different requests to different people for a menu.  Finally, a server came over and we received great service once we ordered (approx 45 minutes to get a menu and order).  . . Went to the room and I wanted to use the bath / jacuzzi (paid for the upgrade so yes!).  Had to wash it with a washcloth and shower gel because it wasn't clean (sparing you the details).  . . Went to dinner at Nobu - Noriko was our server and was super AWESOME!. . Went to the tiny little lounge that has a ship - Cleopatra's lounge. Good DJ, fun!. . Went to the room.  Pillows smelled like they were a billion years old and sweaty.  Bed is SUPER uncomfortable.  Slept with no pillow.. . Next day, called housekeeping and requested they replace the four pillows. Not just the cases.  Came back to the room at midnight and the pillows smelled. No change.  Called housekeeping and 15 minutes later they brought two - not four pillows like I had requested since I wanted them all replaced.  They had to go get me two more.  . . Then they had not replaced all of the towels we had on the floor. They took them but didn't replace all if them. Plus, they didn't replace all of the amenities.. . Not staying ever again.  Ever.
