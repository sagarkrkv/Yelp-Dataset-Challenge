What can you say. Its Del frisco's!!
This place is off the strip but totally worth the effort and trip, if you manage to extricate yourself from the trip. The price is better, and if you were to eat the same meal on the strip it would likely cost you double if not triple the price.. . The boy and I shared the namesake steak, it was delicious. When the steak is brought to your table, the waiter will cut in the center for you to make sure it's cooked to the proper temperature. . . Oh the CRAB CAKE! It is the best crab cake ever! Seriously! That sauce had so much umami flavor and the crab cake had little to no fillers. After eating the cake, I used my bread to slop up as much of what was left on the plate. . . We also brought cupcakes for our friend's dinner to which the restaurant stored for us and didn't charge us a cake cutting fee. I thought that was amazing. A lot of restaurants try to nickle and dime you here and there. They also brought out two large slices of their own cake for our two friends. . . I am definitely returning! Make reservations!!
Bone in filet was perfection and I have been to a ton of steak houses across the country.
The service was really good so I didn't give them 2 stars even though they tried to sit us at the bar after we made reservations thru yelp which takes you to open table. I ordered the rib eye and when my steak came out it was clearly a strip steak. I asked the waiter if he is sure it is Rib eye?!?! He was very nice and offered to change it. The manager came and after trying to convince me over and over that it was a rib eye, agreed that they had made a mistake and it was indeed not a rib eye. 20 minutes later when my wife was done eating my steak came out. They make everyone cut the steak in half to make sure it was cooked to their liking but a real steak house would never do that! It makes the steak cold!! I know good steak from growing up in New York and going to the best steak houses there that known all over the world. This place is off the strip. I found it on yelp because of the great reviews but I'm not a fan!
The best steak house ever!!!  The bone in steaks are perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked to perfection.  Del Frisco's re-defines what a quality steak is.  They don't drown their steaks in butter or anything like that but use the perfect blend of sauces.  Service was incredible they server the timing he brought out wine, appetizers, main course was almost telepathic great timing.  A must try!
This place was really good. I had the filet mignon and i loved it. You can taste the peeper on the filet mignon, which I like. I also had the macaroni and cheese with lobster, creamy spinach and asparagus. Loved it all!  I would recommend the creamy spinach and asparagus side to everyone. I also tasted my husbands shrimp scampi, it was a little to oily for me but the shrimp was good. For dessert the lemon cake was delicious I never thought I would like it but it totally "wow"ed me. The service was even better!!!! I felt like royalty and everyone I mean everyone friendly.
My experience here was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish and, for me, the off the strip location is one of its attributes.   It's an easy cab ride from many strip hotels, especially those on the east side of Las Vegas Boulevard because it's a straight shot down Paradise Road.  . . We had a 6:30 p.m. reservation on a Saturday night and were seated promptly upon arrival.  . . Our server did a great job of walking us the menu and off-the-menu offerings and making recommendations, which later proved to be spot on.  . . Our server and the other members of the wait staff did a great job from start to finish.  The service was friendly, professional, and attentive but never intrusive or pretentious. The meal was well paced.   . . My buddy and I each ordered the 10 Oz bone-in-fillet, seafood paring, salads, and sides, all preceded by the recommended Calamari appetizer.  . . The Calamari appetizer was terrific.  . . The crab cake seafood pairing was excellent.  . . The sides (mushrooms and creamed spinach) were very good.  . . My fillet was perfection.  . . Sadly, after polishing off the Calamari, the salads, the steaks, the seafood, the sides, all washed down by cocktails, neither me or my buddy had room for dessert.   . . I will save room next time for the Lemon Cake.
Sorry this is not the best steak out there , not good enough to deserve 4.5 stars . Id give it 3.5 because its better than average but take off half a star because their mashed potatoes "chateau potatoes " are pretty flavorless and they charge for things like steak sauce . When you're paying $79 for a steak you. Don't need to be gouged $4 for peppercorn steak sauce (although it was good ) . The VIP martini infused with pineapple was awesome though, as was their lemon cake . Their scallops weren't as good as I've had in the Bay Area at 5a5, but their crab cake was great . You will have a good meal here but if spending $200+ I expect a great meal, not just a good one.
After reading the reviews and seeing this place had over 800 reviews with a 4-star plus rating, I figured it had to be amazing.  Well, I stand corrected.  I am torn on whether or not to give it 2 or 3 stars, but went with 2 as "Meh. I've experienced better."  In fact, for the price, I've experienced A LOT better! We went to the restaurant to try their summer pre fixe menu pairings.  The restaurant was somewhat difficult to locate in the restaurant "circle" off Paradise.  Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by teenage hostesses in fish net stockings.  Not very classy.  We read online that the attire was business casual and we dressed for the occasion, only to find a restaurant full of shorts and t-shirts.  I'm not uppity, and I understand Vegas is by and large casual, but that left something to be desired.  Upon being seated we got a waitress whose appearance was unkempt, and when my fiancee asked a question about the menu she proceeded to start talking over her about the specials of the evening and continue through her spiel.  Upon ordering dinner, I requested a glass of whisky to enjoy with my steak.  The glass of whisky made it out after our meal.  We both ordered our Filet's medium rare, and when they arrived they were more well than rare, and very dry.  The server did request we cut into them to make sure "they were absolutely perfect" when they arrived, which was a nice touch.  After much prodding by management, my fiancee agreed to send her steak back for a new one as she didn't want to be a burden or waste food.  The attentiveness was nice, but the steak they brought back the 2nd time (even with my fiancee expressing switch it to "rare" instead) was even more cooked than the first.  Let me be clear, the food was not terrible.  However, for the level of reviews this restaurant has, and the prices they command ($200 after tip for the 2 of us), it is hardly 4-star plush worthy.
3.75 stars. . So many upsides: . - sophisticated, classic steakhouse (i like that shit). - pretty/flirty waitress who checked on us often. - prix fixe menu for $49 (with an upcharge if you order any cut other than filet). - amazing crab cake with lobster sauce...soft, no crunchy outer crust, but delicious, nonetheless . - VIP martini: vodka & pineapples...need i say more?. - lemon cake: gigantic multi-layer fluffy cake, not-too-tart lemon buttercream frosting...amazing for breakfast the next day. - avocado ranch on his salad. . Downsides:. - caesar salad was boring, not enough dressing. - my filet had a huge chunk of something gross & inedible running through it (tendon?) After cutting that part out, the remainder was not well seasoned, far from the tastiest steak I've had. . Sidenote/another downside:. - table of 10+ who'd clearly pre-partied before ordering more drinks at the restaurant. Odd that a rowdy table would be placed in the same room as 6 couples; the restaurant is big enough to separate the partiers from the cupcakers. I feel the waitstaff allowed them to be loud & obnoxious because they didn't want to jeopardize the large tip coming from a large bill. Makes me laugh when 41-year olds try to party like 21-year olds...y'all gon' feel that in the morning!!!
Loved my filet mignon the crab cakes are delish and go with the del salad! i cant wait to go back in November when we visit vegas. Tatiana our server was just top notch!
A must every time I go to Las Vegas!  Get the lemon cake.
Great Old Fashioned Steak House. I enjoyed the 32 oz Wagyu Bone in Ribeye ... 5 Stars !!!! Oysters were not up to par, but the Lobster Mac & Cheese and Potatoes AuGratin were Awesome !!!!
I'd give it 3.5 stars. . . The prix fixe menu is a pretty good value unless you want their 24oz prime porterhouse. I'm OK with an upcharge since that's much different from the 8oz filet it normally comes with. What I have a problem with is getting charged $30 more for a steak that's only $20 more on the menu. When the manager's answer is "that's a corporate decision" and offers no other explanation, I think that's a really really poor answer (if I can even call it an answer). . . The food was really good. I had very little waste on my porterhouse and it was very flavorful. My wife's filet was just right. The shrimp that it came with were huge and had a great bbq type sauce to go with them. . . The service was very good with one glaring exception. They forgot our au gratins. When asked about it she had a blank look in her eyes. About 5 minutes later they were brought out to us and we were told our order had been burned so they made us new ones. No, they weren't. They were simply forgotten. Just say so and we'll move on, do not lie to us. . . A few glitches but the food was stellar. Will we be back......I'm not sure.
Omg this place was amazing!  First time here and the steak was unbelievable!  I had the tomahawk and it was sooo soft it melted in my mouth! U should also put truffle butter on it...May not b too good for the heart but it's ooooh so yummy!  :-)     I don't think I can enjoy another piece of steak anywhere else now. Lol.  The staff was amazing as well.  I even received a personal handwritten thank you card from my waitress.  Thank you to the staff at Del Frisco....u are wonderful.  Can't wait to go back!
Ill make it quick.   Awesome Steaks  Rib eye is my favorite.  Great sides and awesome service.  Great steakhouse just barely off the strip.  It's a steakhouse so its not cheap, so be ready to spend some $$.  Every time I go to Vegas I try and visit this place.
Dropping by this beautiful steak house on my wife's birthday. I was amaze on how quickly they seat us and how well they take good care of us. On top of all that, their food are awesome and meeting our old friend is a great occasion.. . Absolutely great experience.
A pretty typical old school steakhouse - just like a dozen others in LV.  The food was pretty good. We didn't care for the service...they threw food at us and continually interrupted our conversations, and I didn't care for the hard sell on steak toppings or sides. . . I won't hurry back.  There are too many other good steak places in this town to warrant a special trip to this one.
