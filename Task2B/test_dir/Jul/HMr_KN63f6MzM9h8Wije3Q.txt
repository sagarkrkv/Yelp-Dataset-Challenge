We really loved this hotel. Everyone was extremely friendly, our room was very clean with nice decor and furniture, and the casino was practically smoke-free with reasonably priced table games. Even the cocktail waitresses are fast. Overall, this is a five star property that we'll be sure to rebook.
We stayed here 3 weeks ago and had a great time. My husband had a quick business trip so we went back here. Completely different experience. It started off bad in Valet. We were in line for the valet. We had already gotten out of our car and was getting our stuff out. (We were next in line) The next thing we know is one of the valet guys moved the cone for the other lane to open it. He told us to move our car over there. There was no way this was going to happen because we were already blocked in with other cars behind us and now people were pulling over to that lane also. We told him it was obvious we couldnt move and could he please take our car from where it was because we were next in line. He said no and if we didnt move to that lane then we could just wait until he had time to come back to that lane. He had all of the attitude to go along with that statement. My husband and I just looked at each other because we could not believe he spoke to people like that. We waited, but just to get out of line and find the parking garage. We usually self park any way, but my husband had hurt his back so valet would have been convenient. We went in to check in. After the check in process was completed, we asked to speak with management about the valet incident. She called for management and said they would be there soon. We waited for over a half an hour and no one ever came. We finally left to go to our room. When we got off the elevator and started to our room, we noticed it looked like the halls had not been vacuumed in a week. Once we got to our room, it was clean. This tower of the hotel needs a serious remodel and update. We value customer service and when we have a bad customer service experience we chose never to go back. There are too many choices in Vegas to ever be treated like we were.
Price were decent especially on a busy weekend when I went. The room were nice and clean. The only problem I had was room service. It took them over two hours to get to get clean towels.. Imagine if I had a hot rendezvous in another hotel and I couldn't dry myself..
Very nice. Went on the roller coaster - it was awesome. You were able to get a nice view of the strip. It was $14 - worth it.. . Loved the casino - I won some money there, also lost some. Food is good - lots of options.
Rooms are so so and bathrooms are a little run down and dated and small. The pool is fantastic for little kids over 3.5 ft as it doesn't get deeper than that. Casino and mini New York are cool as is the Hersey and Jelly bean Statue of Liberty. Not the quality of top service you expect in Vegas but we did go during summer month so quiet time and pool closed at 6pm.
My boyfriend and I stayed 2 nights (not in a row) in this hotel. The rooms we had was clean and cozy. The first one had a great view (room 1065)but the second view was a brick wall (room 777). Check in was not very quick but the service was perfect. This hotel is perfect for a short stay and it's very cheaper than other hotel in the strip.
This place is visually entertaining, lots to see and do. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. The pool is just "ok" nothing special but I've seen worse.. . The worst part about this casino/hotel and will keep me from staying here again is the tone and mood of so many dealers. Some (very few) were a ton of fun but my friends and i encountered quite a few irritable and obviously bored dealers here. They would snap at us and other gamblers and were often caught staring off into space with absolutely zero interest or attention paid to the table and guests. We learned that tips are shared with all dealers at the end of the night which seems like a really bad way to incent them to be engaged in the guests and create a fun atmosphere. They get tips whether they are nice or not making it feel like they just don't have to try therefore they don't. Last year when we were here we picked new york new york because the gaming area was super fun with the dealers, this year they killed that :( sad...they also have awful wi-fi but that felt the same all over the strip there is most likely too much interference so not their fault but it is part of the surprise $20 a day resort fee which was disappointing
Fun atmosphere, visually stimulating. Tons of things to look at.. A good mix of restaurants and watering holes. Checking in and out was a breeze.. The problem I have is about security. On the second night sometime shortly after 1:30 there was a jiggling at are door. There was a dude putting in door card trying to enter. We called the desk and said they would notify security. Meanwhile this guys trying other doors down the hall. 15 minutes later we call the desk again! In the meanwhile he comes back to our door and is shuffling through a handful of door cards to find one that might work. We yell through the door at the punk a few times to no avail. Security shows up 5 minutes later and confronts the guy. We opened our door to say that's the dude and were told by security that they got it. There was no further contact with security or the desk. So we were left in the dark to what was happening. Scarey. Security at the elevators like other resorts is a good thing after midnight.
The front desk just called and said we were using too many towels! They said we can have three sets, yet the reservation was made for my wife and three little kids in a large room. We had asked for enough towels for each one of us--five sets. . . I've never encountered this kind of pettiness in a hotel. Never! And I've stayed in many, many on business. . . With all the choices in Vegas hotels, why would I ever come back here? I recommend the Venetian or Paris, where I've had great experiences.
Love this casino.....just love it. Plenty of great bars and the slots. I like the layout of the rooms, lost of good choices. Restaurants are good - IL Fornaio is really good, plus there are plenty of reasonable food choices in the NYNY food a ante area - Greenbergs Deli is my favorite. Don't miss the Dueling Pianos.
This place is pretty fun and there is lots of food at a decent price.  There's lots of neat stores including Hershey's! The music is pretty good. This place is good for a gambler on a budget (foodwise).
This hotel will give you a visual overload as soon as you step inside the doors! I will certainly stay here again when I'm in Vegas. The entertainment and the bar scene are excellent; food choices are very reasonable and good quality; the gambling needs work.  That said, I'd stay here if I were you.  Here are some insights:. . Pro:. great variety of food choices, reasonable. Bar at Times Square - dueling pianos is a must!!!. hotel is connected to MGM and Excalibur by walkways; right next to Monte Carlo. clean hotel, great ventilation. great service, check in was actually enjoyable. fast evelators. . Cons:. poor wifi. average pool. 6/5 black jack (play at the others connected). with few exceptions, dealers were not very friendly
Visually impressive.  Nice clean rooms at a fair price.  Gym was nice.  Pool was okay.  Restaurants are a little pricey for what you get, but you can find a few specials if you look around.  Wi-fi was very slow.  Check-in/Check-out was relatively easy.
came here I redeem a free room for my Vegas, spoke to Robert at the front desk, he hooked us up with a players suite for incredibly cheap. My god. Don't go anywhere else but New York New York. Trust me!
My husband and I have never, in our ten years of marriage, taken a trip outside of Oregon. We decided to celebrate our 30th birthdays in Nevada, and booked the New York New York for one night. We were excited to get away and have fun.. . We booked our reservations in February and arrived for our stay on July 12th, right at check in time. The man at the front desk said our room would not be ready for TWO HOURS because there had been a lot of guests the night before who had not checked out on time, and they needed time to clean the room. I'm sorry - the last time I checked, a reservation secured a room for the exact check in time listed!. . He was unapologetic and actually seemed very bothered by us being there. We stood and waited and told him we'd need to be in a room as soon as possible. He put us in the next room "up," which was the Players Suite. . . How awesome. It was directly off of the elevator, so all night long, we were woken up loudness. Not only that, but there was a $22 "Resort Fee" that was supposed to include wi-fi, and no one gave us the password. Even better was the roller coaster outside of the window, which was a cool concept until we realized that every time the roller coaster departed, the reception on our TV went out. . . The one and only perk was that the bed was comfortable. But this was NOT worth the hassle or the money we paid.
My husband and I booked a long weekend in a Marquee Suite over the 4th of July.  We requested a non-smoking room specifically due to my sensitivity to cigarette smoke.  When we arrived in our room, I was extremely upset.. . The first thing we noticed was that there were two ashtrays on the table next to the door.  One of these ashtrays still had cigarette ash in it.  We also were hit by the waft of stale smoke smell from the room.  My gut reaction was, "Oh great, they gave us a smoking room."  However, upon moving further into the room, we saw the advertised no smoking signs with associated fine for smoking in the room.. . I immediately called the front desk to express my concern.  The first concern was my discomfort, followed very closely by the desire to not be charged for smoking in the room because of the evidence left by the previous guests.  The front desk's only solution was to send someone up to "freshen" the room.  . . In addition to the ash trays, we were also greeted by what appeared to be a heavy duty fan of some sort.  When the bellman delivered our bags, he expressed extreme concern as this was no ordinary fan, but was a machine that, if it had been running, would have been harmful to our health.  Luckily, housekeeping was already on their way to attempt to cover up the smoking smell so the bellman didn't have to call to have this item removed.. . When housekeeping arrived, they pulled out an air freshening spray to assist with the smell.  This simply provided a different strong smell, which didn't last.  Over the three day stay, the smell of smoke lingered and was noticeable even on our clothing that we had not worn when we returned home.. . Finally, when we had started to unpack, we opened the mini fridge and discovered leftover food from the previous guests.  . . Overall, I was shocked at the overall disregard for our safety and comfort.
I was recently in Vegas to visit relatives/visit Vegas. We decided to stay in the New York-New York hotel as it was decently priced and seemed to be in the middle of the strip. This was my first time in Vegas and I was traveling with a two year old. Anyway now that you have some background lets get to the review:. . Rooms: Although we chose the cheapest room, it was perfectly sized, nice decor and great view. We were on the 31st floor and faced Southeast above the roller coaster. When I took my first look out the window and noticed the roller coaster, I thought---how loud is this thing gonna be. It wasn't loud at all and I really enjoyed seeing the riders screaming their heads off without hearing it. . . Entertainment: We had a baby sitter for the nigh so--me and  the wife took in a show--Zoomanity. It was very entertaining, we liked that it was performed in the hotel so we didn't have to go far. If you're easily offended or aren't into adult entertainment, this is NOT the show for you. It was a bit pricey but I'm glad we saw it.. . I could go on and on but to summarize...this was a really nice place for a fair price. Centrally located on the strip and has everything you want and need within walking distance for a satisfying Vegas trip. My only complaints about the room: There was a faint stale cigaret smell noticed when we first entered the room. It didn't overwhelm and seemed to fade pretty quickly. Secondly, the room was like a meat locker and when I adjusted the thermostat---I felt more comfortable standing in the Nevada desert. I adjusted it back, pulled the covers over my head and enjoyed a couple days in Vegas at the great New York New York hotel.
Great times at New York New York. Always clean, staff is friendly, love the location and proximity to MGM is a plus. No complaints.
We got this room through Priceline and we were very happy with it! The rooms were spacious and clean. The pillows on the bed are amazing!! The casino actually smells good! It doesn't smell musky. The reasons we did not give this a 5 star are minor but would make a stay here much more enjoyable. The pool closes at 7pm. It would have been nice to enjoy an evening in the hot tub. There is not a mini fridge in their rooms. One of the biggest issues for us was the limited selection of TV channels. Who comes to Vegas to stay in their room?!? We do! We aren't big on the club scene or walking the strip.... We live a few hours away and have been here more times than we can remember so we just enjoy coming to get away from the everyday routine. Unfortunately the selection of channels they did have did not have great reception... Oh and the internet was slow also but it was nice to not use our phones as much as we normally would. Other than that... Great time had at this hotel!!!
This Hotel is not as overwhelming as others in Las Vegas.Easy to navigate and easy to find ones way around from The Front desk,to Casino,to The Strip.Nice dining options to.
I love this place! The hotel is always clean and they have nice furnitures like sofa chairs and a  desk
I came down to Vegas for a trade show and booked at New York New York for a change, my room was large and had a great view, however had a very strong smell of urine, did not smell clean at all, even the bath tub was sketchy, they gave us vouchers for food, restaurant selection was good, but that crazy scent bothers me all night,
I've stayed at this hotel many many times and I have always loved it. The rooms are nice and comfortable. All the variety of yummy foods is wonderful. This hotel to me has so much to give. It's great for kids also, it has a roller coaster and large arcade. I would recommend this hotel.
