I had this place bookmarked since my last trip to Vegas (June 2013) but had never had a chance to try it. With my most recent trip to Vegas being a bit longer of a stay.... finally, I had enough time to make it out to this 24/7 pho joint. I'm glad I did!! . First off, the Crab Rangoon was so good that I ordered a second order... (don't worry, I was sharing haha). So definitely try that!  . For my main dish, I ordered the beef and flank pho... sooooo delicious! I think I'm getting the hang of how to eat pho! I'm still quite the novice pho eater, so I don't have a bunch to compare to... but the pho I had in Hawaii was on par with this establishment. . To be honest, this place was a lot bigger than I imagined and a lot nicer, too. For a place thats open 24hrs a day, I figured it'd be a little hole in the wall... but there is ample seating and the ambience is surprisingly a slight step above casual. (Though you can stroll in here casual, dont worry).
THIS place is awesome! . . Im from the bay area, and we happened to be in vegas for EDC.  I was craving pho only cause we always have it at home, and i was out there for a dam near week! i was tired of spending 50$ on buffets and bogus food so decided to yelp for some comfort food.  Took a taxi here, it was about 15$, waited about 20 minutes and was seated right away.  The prices are generally the same.  The interior is awesome very nice inside.  we ordered bahn xeo, 2 bowls of pho, vermicelli, calamari, and spring rolls.  IT WAS ALL GOOD.  the servers were very attentitive and all this came out to 50$ for 3 people. bravo definitely coming back when were in town! i loved it
This place is the SHIZ NIT!! It's open 24 hours for those late night Pho cravings but they also have all types of family style dishes like roasted duck, saute shrimp & chicken, rice plates, etc.. This is the perfect spot to satisfy those late night hunger probs after a long night of clubbing at Hakkasan, Marquee, Tao.. . EAT. SLEEP. RAVE. REPEAT
Order 3 items. Nothing was served until I asked their server again. Still waiting for my last item. Btw their pho is just so so.
A good bowl of pho for a reasonable price. Got a large bowl of the combination pho for $9. . . The soup is as close to homemade as you can get at a restaurant (especially in Las Vegas, NV). Small selection of meats, but the meats that they do offer are good. They pile on the meats but don't give you enough noodles. They are generous with the vegetables - I asked for extra basil and limes, and they gladly gave me a small plateful. . . We came late night at around 11pm, and there was a waiting list and full lobby. It took about 20 minutes for my table of 10 to get seated; our order was taken within 5 minutes and came out in the next 10 minutes. The service is fast but not attentive. The environment is loud and somewhat chaotic, well decorated. . . Definitely will come here again for a late night eat. . . Pros: food comes out hot and fast. Cons: none
This place is LEGIT especially after a long night of partying. Best hangover cure spot in Vegas! I use to crawl in here to get their medicine.. . This place got the right broth for me. I usually order Pho Dat Biet, the "combination meat " and depending on my mood I have a few go to appetizers I like. The SPRING ROLLS are always good, CRAB RANGOONS are also tasty and also I love to get the SHRIMP MAYO w/ WALNUTS. Try those!. . I recently went and it looks like they renovated the decor to a lil bit more modern look and you really can't blame service. It's usually really packed and the food comes out pretty quick.. . And on top of that it is open 24 hours!!!!
thumbs down! This is the worst service in China town or all of vegas. We have been there 3 times out of convience and each visit has been more disappointing, we will not return. . THE Service is Teribble and on our third visit and first serious offense the manager was Very Rude and basically told us he did not need us. I was polite and patient the manager defensive and rude. But it was a simple complaint we did not get the food we ordered and the manager was Very rude to us when we Tryed to get the order correct he told us we had to pay for the wrong food.
I was there today. After left i just have only 1 thing go around in my mind: Why they could get "The best restaurant" ???!!! I got Pho, nowhere can beat it about the bad taste.Broth and meat, both was so bad. My wife ordered a Bun Bo Hue (her favorite at all) then it disapointed her to such an extent that she couldnt finish it. Of course each person has different taste but i dont want to pay that much for the stuffs not worth it (everything there has a higher price than the others). Not in mood to go back when in Vegas next time.
I always enjoy coming here when I'm in Vegas. Like any of the buffets, this is one of the must stop places.  The food is good and isn't too pricey.  Some of their portions look a lil small when your stomach is growling at you because you've realized just then that man/woman cannot survive on just alcohol and chlorine alone. LOL.  But, it's just enough to satisfy your hunger. I love that this is a 24 hour spot. Too late and you will see some drunks in here acting stupid but nothing over the top to get 'em kicked out. The wait staff are all pretty irritable seeming. LOL. I am not shocked. Their Pho isn't bad but it was a lil too salty for me. My godson, 3 years old, loves their egg rolls and their chow mein. He also likes their grilled pork and chicken. Visits here tend to be with our family who are also out in Vegas, either living there or other family who are just visiting, like us. There can be a wait. So, be prepared for that. And make sure that you give the host your name and that he WRITES IT DOWN on his clip board. Otherwise, you'll be passed up a few times.  I think that was the part that my husband disliked the most.  We'd been standing in the wait area for a while and nobody came to seat us. All of a sudden, 4 punk kids walk in and all of a sudden they are being seated. NOPE. My husband walked past those 4 kids and sat down, knowing that we should be helped first. The kids didn't say anything. They knew that we'd been there before them. The host was confused and my husband had to explain to him what had happened. The host said that he thought that we got there after those kids who he saw just walk in moments before he motioned to them to come and sit.  Anyway, my husband talked to the manager and all was well.  That was just the one time. It hasn't happened ever again since then. . . Food is good. The prices are about right. The pho broth tends to be a lil salty at night. The egg rolls are my godson's fave. They accept cash and card. There is parking all over and it's a 24 hour spot. I don't think you could ask for much more.
I was in town last month for edc.  I'm from NY, so we have some pretty decent pho.  The best is still the one my sister and mom makes.  Every time my bf and I travel to the west coast, I always want to try the pho in town.  Pho Kim Long definitely hit the spot.  I was hesitant at first to pick this spot.  Many of the previous reviews had mentioned about the waiters being rude.  We are from New York, we know what rude is!! We didn't have any problem here.  . . Deco:  it was very simple, many big family tables.  My bf and I were seated at a table that fits 6 people.  We had the entire table to ourselves, even though there were people waiting for a seat.  In NY Viet restaurants, they would easy make you share a table with total strangers!  Overall, the restaurants and waiters seems somewhat clean.. . Food:  I hadthe pho with sliced raw beef.  The broth was very tasty.  I very much enjoyed it.  I have to say that it was comparable to the pho in NY.  It tasted just as good but cleaner.  It sounds strange but if had the pho from pho bang in ny, you would know what I mean.  . . Service: the waiter was attentive and quick.  I'm there for the food, not to make friends.  I just got out of airport security, 5 hrs flight, 1 hr car rental line, I just want quick good food!  This Viet pho spot definitely satisfied my taste buds and made the trip well worth it.
One of my favorite pho joints.. . Pho:. The pho here is definitely on point. The broth comes out steaming hot and the broth is seasoned so well. This is one of the places where the broth is so good you'd clean the entire bowl out. It's addicting how good the pho is here. My equally just as good favorite dish to order here is the calamari. It's literally the best calamari I've ever had. They deep fry in a way that isn't super crispy but also is kind of soft in a way. I don't know how they do it but its the perfect deep fried texture. Also, the portion that they give is enormous! It was just two of us and we couldn't kill the entire plate of calamari.. . Service:. Service here is okay. They seat you quickly if it's not busy and the food comes out quick. If you get pho, it always comes out before anything else does. The waiters were quick with the refills but if you're there for a while the service get slower and slower. It took us a while for them to realize I was trying to flag them down. Then it took even longer for them to get the check out to us. Service here is my only complaint.. . Best part to this restaurant is that it's open 24 hours so you can get your pho craving in anytime.. . TLDR; Good Pho and Calamari. Bad service.
It's bomb! But the customer service sucks! To be honest...almost all Asian restaurants have horrible customer service. But nonetheless I've been coming here for years for pho. Though i do recommend you coming here at the end of your day/night. Because you are what you eat..no really... you end up smelling like you took a shower in pho afterwards..  Cologne/perfume won't help...don't even try it...home should be your next destination...don't even stop for gas
This a staple return spot every time we are back in Vegas. Best Vietnamese in Vegas. Stop searching Yelp, and come here.
My friends and I came to Pho Kim Long to eat dinner around 8PM. Upon first impressions, I liked the decor of the restaurant. It was nicely decorated and roomy. We were also seated immediately. We all sat down, thought about what we wanted to order... 10 minutes had gone by after we were seated and no one came up to us to ask us what we wanted to drink. A couple of minutes later, an older gentleman took our orders. My friend and I both ordered Pho Dat Biet (special combination tender beef noodle soup, $8.75), my boyfriend ordered half of the Ga Chien Gion (deep fried chicken with fried garlic, $13.95 for half chicken), and my other friend ordered Com Chien Tom (shrimp fried rice, $11.50). . . Here came the most disappointing part. I'm not exaggerating when I say that 30 minutes had literally gone by before the first dish came out, and that was my boyfriend's deep fried chicken dish. I thought that this dish was pretty good. It wasn't too salty and I loved the fried garlic. Do note that this dish didn't come with rice so you would need to order it on the side. At this point, I'm starting to look around the room hoping to catch the attention of the workers to see if they had brought out our dishes. 5 minutes after the fried chicken came out, both of the Pho Dat Biet came out. Honestly, I didn't think that it was too good. The broth wasn't anything spectacular and for the "special" bowl of Pho that we ordered, there was barely any beef, tripe, tendon, and all the other components that goes in the special. . . At this point, my other friend who had ordered such a simple dish of fried rice STILL has not received has order. We started trying to track down the employees and finally managed to spoke to one about how we haven't received the last dish of fried rice. There was a couple who was sitting nearby us, who were seated way after we were seated and had managed to receive their food order BEFORE we even got ours! And how is it that the fried rice would be the last dish to come out? Makes no sense to me.... So about 10 minutes after both of the Pho dishes came out, my friend's fried rice finally came out. It didn't look too appealing either... He also mentioned that some of the parts in his fried rice were cold and not warm at all.... . I don't know what happened with our order honestly. Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours, which is great for people who want to grab a late meal after EDC, clubbing, etc ;]. Since Vegas is the city that never sleeps, I'm sure many people there appreciate how late Pho Kim Long is opened. It's possible that at night, they don't have as many cooks in the kitchen or they simply forgot our order... who knows! I most likely wouldn't visit Pho Kim Long to eat again unless I desperately needed some soup or Pho late at night!
Benz is the greatest! He remembers exactly what me and my boyfriend order every time I come in after work and pick up food to take home. I get honey garlic pork chops just ask for extra sauce because sometimes they tend to cook on the dry side.
Went here last night with a couple of friends for the first time in a while because they were craving pho.  It was a fairly busy early Saturday morning.  We were sat pretty quickly which was nice, happy that they have such a quick turnover for tables.. . The food is consistently good every time I come here.  Today the dish I usually order (pork chop w/ baked egg) was extra delicious!  They had a special salt & pepper eggplant that was pretty good as well.. . The only reason I took away a star was because they forgot my drink order and when I asked for utensils they also forgot to bring some by.  They didn't check on us after all the food was dropped off and we had to go to the counter to get our check.. . But all in all, still a great late night place to get your Asian food fix after a night out of clubbing or work!
LOVE. I come to vegas basically just to get their chicken wings and bun. My favorite Vietnamese restaurant ever.
It was pretty packed but our party of 3 none the less was seated within five minutes. The servers definitely pay attention and were at our table to take our order the second the last menu was set on the table. Brown rice as an option is great for us semi-conscious eaters lol
WORSE MANAGEMENT EVER. I came back to this place a year later with my whole family because i enjoyed it the last time we went and the prices were reasonable. My family ordered food that is SUPPOSE to come with rice. The server never told us that a cup of rice would be charged on each person. Who would think rice, so simple and given, would cost so much. When we found out that they charge $15 extra on our bill when it was ALREADY expensive, we questioned the manager about it and they argued with us and told one of the employees to take all the rice, THAT WE WERE EATING, away from us. What happened to customer service and how the customer is always right? What are they going to to do with the used rice? Hopefully throwing it away. But who knows, with their greediness and disrespect to the customers, they must use the used rice to make the fried rice.
This is my favorite late night place after a night of drinking, and for takeout when I'm sick. The pho is great and the ingredients and everything are really fresh, i love the veggie pho and it is full of fresh veggies. I like their bob a teas as well, its always open and always really fast. The service is not the friendliest, but they are probably dealing with a ton of drunks like my friends and I so I'm not too picky.
DO NOT GO HERE!!! I don't usually write bad reviews but place this deserves ZERO stars. They increased and over charged everything on the menu. While eating we were already disappointed how terrible the food was compared to before. . . When the bill came out, we realized they ripped us off. We ordered tons of food, they brought out white rice and charged us $15. First of all, a bag of rice is $25 that will last you for a year. They freaking charge you $1.50 per small bowl...WTF??? We didn't even ask for rice and they brought it out for no reason and refused to refund us the money until we argued with them.. . I would never come back and I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are tons of restaurants around, there is no reason to come here. . . Steam chicken $26. Ca Kho To $18.90. Canh Chua $18.90. Coconut (not fresh) $5.50. Fried Tofu (4 )  $10. Rice - $15 for a bucket . . Vietnames food should not be this expensive. This place is NOT an upscale restaurant. I rather spend this amount at a Thai, Japanese,  or other upscale restaurants. Coconut is usually $2.50, Ca Kho To is usually under $10. If the food was superb, I don't mind paying for it but it wasnt.
Recommended to me by 2 different Vietnamese friends. I love the Pho and egg drop wonton soup here. Egg rolls were great too. The place is always busy which is a good sign and its open 24hrs which is awesome. For 2 people the bill was only like $35 and we were full with 2 large Pho, 2 coconuts/water, and egg rolls. I will definitely be back.
Pho Kim Long is the perfect last meal before you endure that five-hour ride back to Arizona.  And why not?  Food is always light and fresh!. . After indulging yourself for days in The Entertainment Capital of the World, give your kidney  and wallet a rest and come here for some cheap good eats.  I like their egg roll bun with a side of spring rolls.  Nothing like a light vermicelli dish with all my favorite vegetables and some fried fatty egg rolls to soak up all the boozing and food from Sin City.  The prices are reasonable and service is fast.  I don't normally want something hot for the car ride home since it makes me sleepy so bun is the way to go for me.  Maybe one day I'll try their pho.. . Anyways, Pho Kim Long is 24/7 so it's a perfect for all the clubrats and the hungover boozers.  Chances are, if it's after midnight and you're there, you're probably a clubrat or a barfly yourself.  We're all just one big family here.
Is it Westminster pho??? . . Hell no but is it still the only place to go in Vegas after a hard night of partying and drinking ... YEA!! . . If you have been to Vegas a lot then you know this place is famous ... If you haven't been to this place you probably are one of those morons who only stay on the strip ... Just an FYI ... Life does exist off the strip and it's damm good . . Always bring friends to this spot . Always order egg rolls. Always leave satisfied :)
#13 Pho - large is my go-to favorite when a bit dehydrated andhungry from the LV sun!  Staff is efficient and quick.  Lines move fast, and the food is always dependable.  Great to grab breakfast!
Best pho in town! . This place gets packed fast!!!! So show up before busy hours if you know you're gonna be hungry for food here. We've left the place a couple times because the wait list was pretty long. I have kids so their hunger wouldn't last the wait time.
Came here to satisfy my late night hunger. Open 24/7! This place is ok. Nothing close to amazing but satisfying enough for me. They don't have tripe & their boba is nasty & old. Full of loud drunk people & couples who are arguing for everyone to hear. I guarantee you will get a free show to go with every meal, entertaining & full of drama if you come after 12!
Came here for the 1st time on Sunday after a sleepless night. I was starving and wanted a quick breakfast that was on the way home because I was really wanting to finally get some sleep. It was 7 am and this seemed to be the only place open in Chinatown so it was my perfect opportunity to finally try it.. . I was craving pho the last couple weeks which naturally guided me to select from the pho section of their extensive menu. I went with a #13 which was a beef combination pho and included meatballs, tendon, rare beef and brisket. The broth and noodles were right on point with its flavor and wasn't too bland or strong like at some other spots. The meats were good, except for the meatballs which had a weird taste to it. . . This is a fairly large restaurant and probably the biggest pho place I've seen. Do people have parties here like they do at Chinese restaurants? Let's have a pho-king party! Being 24/7 definitely is also a plus and I'll have to keep this place in mind for late night or early morning outings.
I came to try the Pho' of course..... but the calamari was the star of the show!!!. Seriously, very tender, flavorful, green onion topping was amazing!!. The Pho' was good, very good.... definitely worth stopping in..... but for sure get the calamari!
Amazing food, I wish they'd hire more people though. But, every time I go, the waiters always take too long to refill my water. But as for everything else, it's a good place to eat late at night.
Can't go wrong. A clean, modernized decor, and everything we ordered (beef and chicken pho, fresh spring roll) was above average.
I MADE A YELP ACCOUNT just to share my experience !! Okay so straight to the point.. I found a SCRAP/CANNED piece of METAL inside my boba smoothie ! This is so disappointing & especially for one of the top known Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas. I took my smoothie home because I've gotten full from their food but as I started drinking my smoothie... I don't know if the little piece of "sharp" metal was in my actually drink or in the boba balls but regardless it SHOULDN'T had even been in the drink !!! Huge warning/red flag!!! It's sad.. The food was pretty good. But I'm never coming back. Chew your food carefully, you never know what you could potentially be swallowing.
Awesome local Pho joint with delicious options and best of all, open 24 HOURS!. . Pricing is not bad. I've been here with the husband before, as well as friends at Bachelorette parties or just in regular settings. Great place to get food in the middle of the night as well as during the day-time.
Have always been a lover and returning customer at Pho Kim Long. Yes, the hype on this place is a little over-the-top but I can understand, their pho broth is #1 and Pho Saigon 8 is #2 to my taste buds! Can't beat them, they're just too delicious. I've been their customer for about six and a half years now and probably visited this restaurant more than 80 times. Highly recommend their springs rolls (which is a bit over-priced but it's tasty so it's worth the extra few dollars $$), their fried egg rolls, lettuce wraps, and combination pho! They have other selections that aren't just Vietnamese cuisine but that of Chinese, Thai, Korean, and Japanese (very little but still present).. . Their prices have increased over the years but their tastestill gives them the huge reputation they have. Sometimes my visits vary a bit with them when it comes to their service; either they're really awesome and friendly OR they're lifeless and non-attentive. Asides that, I suggest you give this place a visit so you can decide whether or not Pho Kim Long lives up to their name.
We had pancake (banh xeo), braised fish in clay pot (ca kho to) and stir fried veggie - all were awesome. Quick seating despite lines of people. Avocado smoothie is a winner as well!
A must when in Vegas and want great food,. Busy place but I understand why.. Everything was perfect!
When I'm not eating pho, my other options are chicken pad Thai which theirs are good and Hong Kong style chow mein (crispy noodles). Every dish I have tried has been satisfying, can't complain. This spot is great for after drinking with friend, just lately the wait has been approximately 20 minutes. Vegas heat sucks!!!
Waited 14 minutes after being seated for our order to be taken. Not a good start. Food arrived 22 minutes in. The shrimp spring rolls were not good, tasted old (we arrived at 10:30am, possibly made the prior day). The pho is salty, but that seems to be the trend, but it was not bad.
mmm my favorite pho place in town! I've been going to Pho Kim Long for years and they definitely offer tastiest and most fulfilling pho.  The special combination runs a very reasonable $8.
Its not only pho kim long. Its pho kim AWESOME!. . Pros. Great Food. Fast Service. Great Prices. Good portions. Open 24/7. . . Con - Wish they didn't use MSG. Parking challenging sometimes.
Pretty yum.  They were short on everything because it was EDC weekend, but the dishes tasted authentic and were satisfying
This is always where we end up when we want pho in Vegas. I believe it's the biggest one but it gets so crowded that you'd probably wait less at a smaller one. Its off the strip across the 15 freeway near china town. The pho isn't that great and it's pretty pricey, but who cares when you're hungover and you just want food. Don't get the meatballs. It falls apart and doesn't have that firm texture. . . The service is OK. Always have to ask multiple times and there's this one old man who hates his job. . . The eggrolls are pretty bomb though.
The star is not for the food is for the service is a shame good food but bad bad service
