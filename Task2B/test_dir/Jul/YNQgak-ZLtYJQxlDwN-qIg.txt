Fresh and good for the price. . Four of us for 120. . Just the flower displays will increase your appetite. . I must have 4 servings of the chinese shrimp dumplings. . The flank steak was good. . N the snap peas and Greek salad were very fresh.
3.5 stars. . After years of anticipating to try the Wynn Buffet, I can finally say that i've tried this infamous buffet.. . On a monday night for dinner, prices were $38.99 (which was the cheapest amongst the wicked spoon, bacchanal, etc).. . The selections were pretty standard and to be honest, a little underwhelming. They have all the basic selections of specialty salads, a pasta station, few sushi options, carving station, and of course a dessert selection.. . In my opinion, the selection here was definitely more limited than wicked spoon and/or some of the other buffets that I've been to. Their prize and glory would of course be the king crab legs, which were plentiful and sweet. I liked that they were already cut in half, making the picking a lot easier. Some commented that they had to deal with frozen crab legs, but ours were fine. . . I would say the highlight of the mealwere these gigantic spanish spiced ribs that were to die for. Unfortunately, the prime rib was a disappointment. The crust was WAY too salty and almost inedible. I'm not a big pasta girl, so all those items were wasted on me. They did have a cute little peking duck bun station that was nice, although the server was never around. In regards to the desserts, they have the standard gelatos, crepe station, and many chocolate delicacies. . . All in all, for the price, I would say that The Buffet is a solid 3 stars option. Considering that we came at an off hour, i can't really complain about the wait. However, if I waited longer, I probably would've been more disappointed.. . Would I come back? Probably not, like I said, everything was just okay, but nothing was memorable.
UUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHH, WOW!  I'm not saying I'm a buffet connoisseur or even an expert on breakfast, with that said I LOOOOOOOVE breakfast foods.  Before I get to the food lets talk about the atmosphere.  . . As you enter you all you can see (what I would label) the garden area (which are usually the pictures that come up when you google image search Wynn Buffet).  I'm not sure what it takes to be seated there, but I feel as the lowly peasant I am I may never sit there.  As you walk further back you see dining areas to the side of the garden which makes it seem as if you are walking into the Tardis of buffets (bigger on the inside than the outside).There's even a bathroom and phone area.. . Now to the food.  Not only was there tradition breakfast food, but other dishes that you wouldn't; expect such as veggie tamales, spring rolls, pizza, and even cheeses.  I stuck with tradition.  Mini waffles, pancakes (that they make right in front of you and you have your choice of toppings), little bricks of pepper jack hashbrowns, 2 types of french toast, eggs in many different ways (along with an omelet making station), blintz with sweet ricotta cheese inside, and your choice of dessert.. . It was a feast for all the senses.  Lastly if you have any allergies or any other food problems, you can ask your server to have the chef take you around to help you with your food choices.  We saw this in action and think it's a great idea.  . . I gave it 5 stars but the price was steep, but you are getting a lot for your money.   It's not just food, but the experience.
Umm... how does this place not have a 5 star average? It is absolutely amazing and the highlight of my Vegas weekend trip! I cannot wait to return.. . We did the Sunday brunch buffet. We got there around 10 or 11AM, I can't really remember, but the line wasn't long at all... maybe 15 minute wait tops. Our total was about $55 because we opted to do the $16 all you can drink mimosas (and wine, bud light, and sangria)... it is totally worth it, especially since the single drinks are so expensive anyways... and our server KNEW to keep filling them up! They were never empty!. . The food is great, we did a walk through first to see what all they offered, which I highly recommend...you can methodically plan how you will fill your tummy to oblivion!. . My favorites:.   - Mini bagels with cream cheese and lox (capers, tomatoes and other fixens available).   - Cocktail shrimp.   - Sushi (California and veggie were offered).   - Enchiladas.   - Pancakes with strawberry butter (make your own station with tons of toppings).   - Cheese blintz (with strawberry sauce... to die for!).   - Bacon (they had regular homestyle bacon and a huge slab that they cut from).   - Ice cream (Espresso all the way!).   - Cream puffs.   - Mimosas (like I said they were never empty and we drank a ton ofthem!). . Only two complaints...Skip the mac n cheese... although I do love the stuff, it just tasted like Stouffer's, also the greek salad would have been good if they didn't put lettuce in it (like a traditional greek salad is just veggies and cheese) the lettuce was soggy and not appetizing. . . Our server was excellent and attentive, the place is beautiful and clean, and tons of people working their stations so you are never staring at an empty counter.. . Foodie Heaven on Earth!
I went here this am and its was ridiculously overpriced because it's 4th of july weekend! ($40) Expect a regular buffet nothing special.
Not sure what all the fuss is about. Came here on the 4th of July to try their $19.95 breakfast buffet only to find out that since it was a holiday they increased their price to $39.99 and called it a 4th of July brunch. Was it worth $39.99? Absolutely not. $19.95? Maybe. Food was decent. Had the basic stations, but compared to some other buffets in Vegas it was very underwhelming. Was disappointing esp after reading such great reviews about the Wynn buffet. For the price I expected a lot more variety and stations. I would take Cosmo's Wicked Spoon over this anyday. They at least have a gelato bar.
I came here on a holiday wekend so they jacked the price up. Lame. The food was good. Nothing that was spectacular or stood out. I think the Bellagio and Caesars buffets are better. The service was awful. We waited 25 minutes to get a glass of water. They should have just had it waiting at the table when we were seated. It is not that difficult to just serve beverages. Our server said he was overwhelmed? It was just the section we were sitting though. We saw one of the servers from the other sections and begged for some water and she just let us move to her section. That helped with the service, but we were already mad about not having drinks for so long.
Went last year and remembered that this place is amazing. Another great buffet in Vegas that you need to check out! . . Didn't wait long at all for the lunch, which was nice. Good variety of food. The only drawback for me was that the desserts were not the greatest. However, their other dishes helped make up for it. . . The dining area just looks so regal and fancy. The customer service was very nice as well. I remember my friend asked if they had a cherry coke and unfortunately the waiter said no but he could try to make one. He came back with a coke and put in a maraschino cherry and some of the liquid. It wasn't the best, but at least they tried to put in the effort. . . I still like Bacchanal better, but the Wynn buffet is pretty good too. . . Overall, the food was great, the customer service was excellent and the environment was super fancy! Definitely recommended.
Use to be the BEST in town. Now the FIRST PLACE is BACCHANAL at caesar palace. I do not recommend anymore the buffet. You would be dIsappointed. We could have thought that after beeing so good they would have make a special effort at the apperance of bacchanal. It is the contruary. Chinese food is not varied and no good. Meat is very poor. Pizzas are awfull. Salads and vegetables with no taste. Deserts are a desolation. Ice cream a joke . Used to be a huge fan no more !!!
Amazing BREAKFAST buffet. Beautiful decor, attentive serving staff, clean buffet, always stocked, and delicious food.  We have eaten here several times and have loved it each time. . . Prices during week days are right on but the weekends double in price.. . Haven't had the buffet for dinner so can only review breakfast - breakfast buffet = Awesome.. . Cumbersome check in with hostess.  They also seem confused on what to do.
This was a pretty good Buffet. A little pricey but when you have that much variety going on I can understand the cost. . . The categories include, pasta, Asian, salad, pizza, meats, seafood and so forth. . . EVERYTHING tasted good. Everything. I cane here for brunch and they had a little but of everything. Their baked goods are exceptional. . . The service was pretty good. I do t know what there really is to add to a buffet kind of atmosphere, but the servers were attentive and they gave requested items in a fairly reasonable amount of time. . . I would come back to try dinner.
Time: End of June, Sunday Brunch . Smoked Bacon: 5 stars, was one of the best I've had. Porridge: 5 stars, simple and yum.. . Everything else was close to at par. I won't be coming back.
Sunday brunch at the Wynn was mine and my wife's first buffet experience in Vegas. We red rave reviews and it was on several 'must eat' lists. The food was exceptional, but honestly, for the price, I don't think it was a good value. I wish we'd come for the regular, much more reasonably priced breakfast buffet and saved our all-you-can-eat splurge for the Bacchanalian Buffet or one of the Brazilian restaurants in town. . . The best things we ate were breakfast foods and pastries. If you're planning a visit, forgo the extra-expensive brunch buffet and just get breakfast.
One of our cabbies recommended The Buffet at the Wynn when we asked him which was the best buffet in Vegas. My friends and I walked over here for after going to Encore Beach Club and around 4PM, there was no line.. . My boyfriend had a tank on when we noticed the "proper attire required" sign, so he borrowed one of my friend's cardigans and got in just fine.. . For $40 at weekend dinner price, it seemed worth it! The beautiful decor made me feel like I was walking into a fairy tale.. . The options were plentiful and well organized. Pretty great quality as well! I really enjoyed the pastas, rib eye steak, and mashed potatoes here. Even though I was too full to really eat more, I just HAD to try their beautifully presented dessert. . . I left The Buffet painfully full. I'd recommend this place for sure!
My friends and I came on a Sunday for dinner. $43+ per person is not an amount I would casually toss around, but The Buffet was well worth the money! We arrived around 4pm and didn't have to wait in line. Go to the register, pay, and take your dinner ticket to be seated.. . I was mesmerized by the gorgeous decor when we walked in. We felt like we had entered the world of Alice in Wonderland! The food selection was absolutely mouth-watering. My favorites were the shrimp cocktails, prime rib eye, and the mashed potatoes. I also recommend ordering the raspberry sweet tea. My friends and I were ridiculously full by the end of the meal. If I had food coma and was ridiculously full until 2am (which I was), then I definitely got my money's worth! . . The servers were very attentive. It was easy to maintain eye contact with them to request extra drinks. They also came often to clear our empty plates. This buffet was recommended to us by one of our taxi drivers. I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area!
Preferred this buffet to the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo. I thought the food and the deserts were better. A little cheaper too! More options here and tastier food :) delish!
I had dinner here tonight. It was $43+ in total with tax, before tip. I felt that if I were staying at Wynn, I would eat there for convenience but I would not make it a destination. I really want to rate it more like 3.75 stars. . . Decor: The decor was comfortable and nice. They have many different areas, some nicer than others. You may be seated in a larger area than one of the smaller more luxurious areas. . . The Service: Very respectible. From the minute the valet took my car to the return of the car, the staff were all very helpful and accomodative. . . The Food: . . - It was good but lacked the more gourmet items of Bacchanal (Caesar's), Wicked Spoon (Cosmopolitan), and even Bellagio Buffet. . . - They also had less of a variety than Bellagio (The Buffet), Cosmopolitan (Wicked Spoon), Bacchanal (Caesar's). The delicacy of items was also kind of lacking. . . Some examples:. . - For meats, they had no lamb. Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon had a great lamb which is custom seared to your liking. . . - For shrimp, they had good but not so great shrimp. Caesar's (Bacchanal) had large tiger shrimp. . . - For oysters, well, they had no oysters of any kind. . . Cospmoploitan's (Wicked Spoon) had cooked oysters but no raw ones. . Caesar's (Bacchanal) had raw oysters.. Aria had raw oysters. . Bellagio (The Buffet) had no oysters at all.  . . - No smoked salmon or any kind of salmon. Bellagio had smoked salmon at dinner. Others may have had too.. . - The sushi area was limited. There was no sashimi, mostly sushi rolls and one eel sushi. I tried none of it. . . - For desert, they had a good selection, but nothing like the giant strawberries at Bacchanal (Caesar's). I will say that the desert section was better than the rest of the buffet. . . It's very good overall but I can't see going back to it. It's good but lacks the higher-end / wow elements of some of the others, but avoids the mostly fried Planet Hollywood fare.
"Hands Down One Of The BEST!". This has got to be one of the best hotel buffets that there is to offer! The price is high but it's very well worth it! I don't think there is one thing they didn't have that I didn't like! The fact that the dinner has all gourmet steaks and seafood all you can eat is amazing! The whole asian theme when you walk in is pretty cool as well! Go really hungry so that you can get your money worth!
I'm no expert on buffets.. In fact I try and avoid them. There's a little switch that goes on in my brain that tells me I need to eat as much as possible so I get my monies worth... The more expensive it is.. The more I try and eat.. (We have Sizzler in Australia and I always overate to the point of almost throwing up!). . Back to the buffet, my partner and I were not expecting much when walking in here so even the decor impressed us.. And what looked like a ridiculous dessert bar.. I had to do a lap of what was available first so I could work out an order of what I could fit in my stomach because there is no way I could have one of everything!!! There are so many options.. . . We started with a small cheese/salami plate made up and tomato, mozzarella basil salad.. Both yum. The chicken noodle soup was also delicious.. Had a duck bun, prime rib, turkey leg, honey fried chicken, seaweed salad, crab legs, sweet asparagus, guacomole, sweet potato, tuna poke and by then I was pretty much full!! I had just enough room to try a couple of desserts, the vanilla ice-cream and the passionfruit tapioca cup was DELISH!  . . We enjoyed ourself over 2 hours and I think we would come back just to sit in the pretty floral decor!!! Oh and if you like sweet get the raspberry ice tea!
Everything was just okay. Literally. I don't really think theres much to say about it because it's a buffet, but heres my attempt. . . $41.99 for dinner on a Saturday night. Because we had more than 6 people, 18% gratuity was automatically added which came out to about 50$. There was almost no line, and we were seated within a short time.. . Pasta- beef lasagna was okay, my favorite was the three cheese ravioli with mushrooms. but then again, cheese and mushrooms are my favorite things. . . Cajun clams, corn, sausage, etc.- sauce wasn't that flavorful, it was mild and light.. . Mussels- it was okay.. . Dim Sum- Siu Mai was the best of the worst, dumplings sucked, etc.. . Steamed Buns (the station where they make it for you)- pretty decent, not bad for a knock off peking duck bun.. . Quesadillas- it was meh.. . Carne Asada Taco- not bad, it tasted like exactly how it was supposed to taste. It was nice that the corn tortilla was warmed up.. . Pastrami- good selection of hams and cheeses along with bread.. . Lamb Chops, Prime Rib, Tomahawk Cut (Ribeye)- they were all meh. The best was the prime rib- so get that!. . Crab Legs- frozen, typical. add drawn butter and lemon for best taste.. . Shrimps- meh.. . Guac and chips- not bad.. . Poke- sucked, the flavor was too strong and you don't even taste the poke.. this was my first time having crappy poke. Now I know what that's like... they gave literally... two pieces. what.. . Sushi Rolls- meh. . . Dessert- pretty decent. Ice cream comes in a small cone and with choice of topping, the creme brulee was good (but how do you mess that up), everything else was okay.. . I'm sure theres more food but its hard to review a buffet where everything tastes ok and because its a buffet you can't really expect much. I was surprised this place had so many reviews but I'm glad I got to try this place.
AMAZING! I loved everything about it
For those who are planning on eating the Buffet at Wynn and wants to see how the buffet looks like, here's a Complete steady tour of the Buffet at Wynn:. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws5o24QQg3E. . If you guys want to save some money and eat dinner food for cheap, this is what I did, first of all, lunch is served from 11am to 3:30pm and dinner from 3:30 to closing. I went and stood in line at 3:10 and got to the cashier at 3:20. I ended up paying the $26 lunch price. After that, we went to seat down, and viola 3:30 came around and they brought out all the premium dinner food like prime ribs and crab legs. By the way, dinner on Friday is $41, so I saved $16 and get to eat the good food.. . . I had an opportunity to eat at Wynn for the 2nd times in 2 years. The food has gotten a lot better then previous years. . . There were a wide variety of food to choose from. I believe the food are way much better when it's served on Friday to Sunday.. . They now have street tacos, last time I ate here, they didn't have this.. . I wish they had King crab legs like at Bellagio buffet and Aria buffet. They only serve snow crab legs instead. . . Dessert station was OK not that impressive like Ceasars Palace buffet. They do have candy apple.. . Overall the food was pretty good.
There' was a lot of selections and everything was good. The set up and displays were clean and neat.  However, there's no crab legs for brunch so that was a big disappointment for me.
Overrated.  I don't recommend this buffet.  We went for Thursday dinner, which costs around $40/ person.  I was excited because I've heard so many good things about it.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  Variety was limited.  Street taco station was not done setting up.  Pasta was bland, bread was not fresh, ahi poke only had like 2 pieces on a plate. I would look crazy holding 5 small plates just to get a serving of ahi poke.  . . The best thing I ate was the cookie in a dish and the creme brulee.. . Mirage buffet is so much better.
It's a close one between the top 3 buffets in Vegas (Wynn, Caesars and Wicked Spoon @ Cosmopolitan) - but after trying all three for the Nth time - I have to still give the edge to the Wynn as the top buffet in LV.. . The reason - quality.. . While they don't offer nearly as much in terms of variety, they make it up by making sure everything they serve is top notch.  The crab legs here are the best versus any other buffet I've been to, bar none.  Same goes for the prime rib, lamb chops and also their pasta and carnitas stations.  The flavor of all the dishes are excellent and even their breakfast options are good.  The fresh strawberries they serve is almost worth the price of admission alone.. . The dessert stations here are also top notch.  The gelato they offer is excellent and I still can't get over how good their vanilla bean gelato is after all these years.. . You really can't go wrong with either Caesars, Wynn or Cosmopolitan - but if you're a crab lover like me, or just want to really get the best bang for your buck - make sure you hit upthis place during your visit to LV.
One word: Wow.. . I'm no Buffet expert, but I definitely am in agreement with most of the Yelpers on here by saying: Holy Crap, this place is good! And I'm not just saying that because it was free for us. This place is probably one of the few buffets, in life, that I feel is deserving of the price point. . . First of all, it's in the Wynn, so you know the ambiance is nice. We were staying over at Encore and got a deal where two free buffet passes came with the room rate. We headed over for dinner on a Saturday night around 7:30. Surprisingly, not much of a wait. As with all buffets, I like to make my rounds to scope out the offerings before deciding what I want to eat and I'm going to go ahead and suggest you guys do the same. Why? You will grab everything along the way because it all looks so good and, before you know it, you will have an insane heap of food on your plate.. . A lot of reviewers say there wasn't a lot of variety, but I don't know how much more you need. And this food? Fucking Quality. I'm so serious. I actually was shocked to experience such great food at a Buffet. Even it is the Wynn. Just thinking about the food makes me want to go back. Seriously. It was that good.. . They have a selection of pastas, Asian food, loads of meat. I mean, LOADS. I've never seen my boyfriend eat so much meat in his life and suffered through the meat sweats to prove it.. . Some of my favorites were: Mac and Cheese, Ravioli, Garlic Cauliflower, Batter fried chicken w/syrup (to taste like chicken and waffles), chicken dumplings, asparagus, Chicken Sausage (yes! Chicken Sausage) and all the assorted shellfish. Even their pizza was decent and buffet pizza is NEVER good, usually. I didn't even scrape the surface at this place either. They had an entire cheese and cracker section, and their desserts? Good golly, Miss Molly! It was so hard to decide. And they were ALL good.. . I will emphatically recommend this place to anyone looking for a buffet in Vegas. There is something for everyone here and this may be the only buffet I ever revisit in Vegas.
Came here on a Friday night around 6:00 PM and it wasn't TOO busy yet. For Friday night dinner, it was $39.95 for dinner and since we had a party of 10, they added a gratuity of 18%. . . The decor is just beautiful as you walk into the buffet dining room. It looks like something from Alice in Wonderland. The meat selection here is great! If you love meat, I think this buffet will serve your needs. The salad and veggie selection was great as well. There really isn't much seafood here, but didn't complain since I am not really much of a seafood person. They have a decent dessert selection. There are about 6-8 different flavors of gelato, 6-8 different types of cakes and few different types of cookie selection. I would have to say though their dessert selection isn't as great as Wicked Spoon.. . Overall, it was a great experience. Will be back when in town for some more meat! :D
The food here was classic and really good. It had the standard items like crab, prime rib and pasta bar. Even with nothing special, this Buffett is really good. The food was prepared very well and the restaurant was clean. The staff was very responsive and friendly. I would return the next time I am in Vegas.
