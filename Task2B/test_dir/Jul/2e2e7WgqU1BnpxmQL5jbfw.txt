For a forty-five minute wait, I expected a sandwich made of unicorn meat and vegetables grown on virgin soil - a sandwich that would blow me away and asking if this was real life! Instead, I got a sandwich that tasted like what I ordered - chipotle chicken avocado. Yawn. (And clearly this was life.). . If I had known my sandwich was going to taste like a regular sandwich, I would have slept in and ordered room service. At least I would waited that forty-five minutes in bed. I still give this place a decent rating because the sandwich was decent. This is also a very good cheap food option in the Strip.
Good, solid sandwiches. Excellent? No chance. Can you find better? Yes! This place must be rated high for convenience, diverse menu, and hours of service. For those late night diners looking for recovery food from a rough night out with adult beverages this is the remedy and much better than your typical Denny's.. . I can appreciate it's model, brand, execution and chipotle like concept, but it's not a exceptional deli. I stand behind my bay area favorite (Ike's). In my view this is what Quizno's aspired to be, but could never execute.. . I was disappointed by it's portions (too small for my liking). I liked my chicken sandwich, but nothing was memorable. I would return if needing an alternative to the buffets on the strip, but by no means is this a destination joint in my book.
Best sandwhich EVER!
I came here with 7 other people. We all wanted Earls before the trip back home to CA. The service is great. I love the choices and the food arrive still warm. I had the full Montegu. It was yummy and shared the mac n cheese my boyfriend. I had leftovers and ate it on the drive home and it was still good. . . Food is cheap compare of most other places in Vegas. There is room for groups to sit together. We just waited for a little bit before finding a seat. If anything the people before either didn't know how to clean up after themselves or choose to be rude and left it there when the trashcan is 5 steps away. Watch out for that.
I finally got to check out Earl of Sandwich (yes, I know there's one in OC now but I haven't even been to that one either, trust me it wasn't due to a lack of trying), after being on my list for years. The group I was with was making bets/to-do items for our weekend in Sin City and this was one of my items.  Affordable and 24/7 sounds good to me especially since my friends who are Vegas regulars always spoke well of it.. . I got the Chipotle Chicken Avocado and it was tasty but not sure if it's worth all the hype. The bread was nicely toasted but do wish there was more inside goods in my sandwich. It just didn't wow me like sandwiches at other joints which I still think quite fondly of. Perhaps I should try one of their other sandwiches; I'm not ruling it out just wanted to get my oral pleasure on. And I didn't get my O moment here.. . Do be warned not all their buzzers work, mines didn't light up or buzz and after noticing everyone in my group get theirs and other folks after me in line get theirs, I had to finally go and investigate to find out where my sandwich was, it was just chilling there.  Tried to get also an ice cream sandwich and they either ran out or were phasing it out.  Sadly, my cousin's beloved Caribbean Jerk Chicken is no longer available and the staff couldn't give us a reason why.
Probably the cheapest thing you can get on the strip that tastes bomb. If you're like me, $6 can feed you twice. Eat half for lunch and then eat the other half when you're drunk later.. . The best are the chiptole chicken or the tuna melt.. . Be prepared to wait in a ridiculous line. It's so cheap and good everyone goes here.
I've only had Earl Of Sandwich a couple of times, but never had the Holiday Sandwich-and it's what I've been missing in my life. Holiday Turkey, stuffing, gravy & cranberry sauce, holy mother of sandwiches! Now I dream about it in my sleep thank you very much Christina Y. . . It was crowded and a bit messy-hey, it's Vegas. the service was nice and although the Lavender iced tea was dry and empty-someone from the back grabbed our glasses and hooked us up. . . A great stop on Miracle Mile for a reasonable bite-and oh that holiday sammie, more please
Earl of Sandwich was a quick, easy and convenient place to eat, if you are staying at Planet Hollywood.. . The food was perfect for a lunch time treat and was delicious. . . My Husband wasn't a fan of the Mac and cheese but enjoyed his sandwich. Prices are decent for the area and won't break the bank.. . I would recommend checking them out. . . For 30$ we had two sandwiches, two drinks, two bags of chips, Mac and cheese and potato salad.   Anywhere else, this combination would have been a hefty price.
Great late snack meal, the sandwiches and its ingredients are fresh. I had the chipotle chicken and bacon, would come back again
Obsessed with Earl of Sandwich! By far my fav place to go. A bit pricey but everything in Vegas is..its worth the money!
Too overhyped. I came here with my boyfriend and the line was super long. However, this place is opened 24-hours so I'm sure it's not this packed every hour. We ordered The Full Montagu, Chipotle Chicken Avocado, and The Earl's Club. All of them were about the same. I preferred the Earl's Club but it's not much different from your average BLAT. The other two were okay too. Perhaps because we took it to-go, but the bread was not that soft. I'm not exactly sure why this place is raved so much but it was worth a try despite somewhat of a disappointment.. . Prices were reasonable though and even though thesandwiches are not too large, they fill you up.
Every time I go to Vegas, I find my self here. It's like a religion now to eat here. Get their chicken avocado! It's amazing. Just eat here and you won't regret it.
Really good sandwiches, awesome desserts too. I thought the prices were a little steep but not outrageous....but I'm comparing to eating off strip for the most part because I live here. . . The service was fast considering how busy they were.. . I'd definitely recommend checking this place out...especially for tourists and if you're already in the area. Probably not worth the hassle for locals unless you're already stuck on the strip for another reason.
This place is legit shit. Seriously. Go here!! Sandwiches here are absolutely fantastic and I'm not a sandwich fan at all, until all my friends that knew if the place told me to go here! They have a toaster similar to Quiznos except better in my opinion and a really good variety of sandwiches, salads, soups, and even breakfast items and small dessert snacks. I had the tomato soup with extra croutons and my friend and I shared the Full Montague and Holiday Turkey. It was creamy tomato soup and really tasty, I took the recommendation of extra croutons from another yelp review and don't regret it once so ever. Ingredients in both sandwiches were very fresh and a good amount to pack enough flavor. I really enjoyed the full Montague but hell if the Holiday Turkey is available (bc apparently it isn't always around), get it!!!! It's literally thanksgiving packed into one sandwich with stuffing, cranberry sauce, turkey, mayo and gravy. Freaking out of this world!!! I want to get another before leaving Vegas! There's plenty if sandwich options. Wish I was around long enough to explore the other options, but will always remember this place whenever visiting Vegas.
Whenever I'm in Vegas, I will skip the buffet and head to the Earl of Sandwich for their amazing BLT!  OMG!  Sooooo good!  I recently introduced my boyfriend to it and now he is a fan as well.  Specifically he said, "That's probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had."  He's not a food critic or anything, but he's seriously picky about food and critiques food often if it's not to his liking.
My absolutely favorite - healthy, fresh food, great price. . It's very hard to find healthy food in Las Vegas and this place is a safe choice.
Not sure why this place has such great reviews. I am surprised. I think its an ok sandwich spot. It does the trick, but nothing outstanding.
Got to try two sandwiches, always seen this place on yelp but finally found this place and got it. the price isnt vegas price so enjoy that! . . the sandwich is nice and warm i think its kinda small but the rpice is good . the place is good! long line though but kinda fast i guess
amazing!!! better than anything. anything. I ordered the pastrami sandwich and let me just say... I wasn't expecting the amazingness. I even had to go back later in the day and order something else because it was that good.
AWESOME place for lunch, and not too expensive. The sandwiches are delicious.
This is a must visit place in Vegas whether you're drunk or sober. The food is inexpensive and soooo tasty. Order the club - or any sandwich really because they are all good. The par baked bread that is finished in the toaster really makes the sandwich. Then add a cup of tomato soup. Lastly, grab a chocolate chip cookie, you won't be disappointed.
Disappointed, ok food...not what I expected for the price.
Let me preface this review by saying that I am not that big on sandwiches.  Sometimes I feel sandwiches are something you make at home, not really worth going out of your way for.  Then, I had a chance to test Earl of Sandwich.  This is my fav sandwich spot hands down.  I am so glad they built on in downtown Disney which is a lot closer to me than Vegas.  I usually get a hot sandwich and the tuna is so good!  The way they grill the hot sandwiches is perfect.  While, I don't frequent the shops at PH when I go to Vegas, I would recommend trying out this place if you are at the shops and just want something quick.
We always end up coming here on any trip to Vegas! Where else can you get a yummy meal for $6-$7 on the strip??  I usually get the full montagu, though it really just depends what kind of a mood I'm in!  There's always usually a line, but I've gotten lucky during odd hours (in-between meals) where the line was fairly short, and it moves fairly quickly for the most part too.  I love that their sandwiches are so warm and toasty right when you get them, and they're also the perfect size for me (though admittedly I don't eat that much!)  They've got tables & seating right there too, usually not too hard to find a seat because people finish eating pretty quickly.  Anywho, definitely worth a visit if you're in Vegas, and the biggest money-saver yet!  A Vegas rarity.
open 24 hours! thats always a plus. its great if you like sandwiches a lot.
The food at Earl of Sandwich was good, but the restaurant was not what I expected. For whatever reason I assumed I would be visiting a diner, but it was more like a chain restaurant. I wasn't impressed by the side dishes, and the sandwich was good, but it wasn't some sort of epiphany.
I loved Earl of Sandwich in the Palms! I order the Italian everytime and enjoy a cold beer with it. Used to go eat here after I got off work late at night at least once a week.. . Reasonable price, great sandwich. I'd recommend it.
Love it, even if they don't have whole wheat bread ha!
tuna melt with bacon.. . that is all. . . a++++++++++++
Delicious, affordable, and quickly prepared food located in the Planet Hollywood. With so many places that overcharge for food on the Strip, this place is a must try for a quick lunch or food for the drive home.
This place is the epitome of quality food at a reasonable price.  For being located in the Planet Hollywood shops you would expect some type of large mark up here but that is not the case.  This is a fantastic deal for a quick bite to eat, quick service and delicious sandwiches.. . Since I knew that a single sandwich wouldn't be able to curb a Vegas sized appetite I added on the Tomato Soup which of course is the perfect compliment to any delicious sandwich.. . I went for the Full Montagu and Lauren V. ordered the Caprese sandwich.  If memory serves me correct I don't think we put down our sandwich after the first bite nor did we share with each other.  That leads me to believe that both sandwiches were amazing.. . Easy solution for anyone thinking about coming here: just do it.  It's a steal for the quality of food.
I never thought I'd give Earl of Sandwich a bad review; I've been coming here for years and thoroughly enjoy their Original. This time, the bread was way too much for the meat that they put in and they forgot to put any mustard in the sandwich.  Please change it back!
After all the social media buzz about this place, I stumbled upon it at 12:15am with a Fat Tuesday drink in one hand and a growing appetite from walking around the Vegas Strip. . . I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Avocado and it was pretty good. I actually split it with my boyfriend and he enjoyed it too. I like the "crunch" factor of the bread and the saucy mayo, hot chicken, and nice schmear of avocado BUT they are kind of on the smaller size of sandwiches for $6-$7. Now this place is a huge upgrade from the ordinary Subway sandwiches, its a uniquely crafted panini and is open 24 hours. . . I would eat here again, but it would not be one of my "go-to" places.
What a great option for people to get fed on a dime. Compared to bustling glamour of the Vegas buffets and other expensive dining choices, Earl of Sandwich delivers a fantastic assortment of sandwiches in the heart of the Strip.  With my entourage I was able to try the Caprese, 1762 Original and Tuna Melt.. . Admittedly the sandwiches themselves were nothing spectacular on the palate, but Earl of Sandwich wins four out of five purely on the value that you are getting from the quality of these six dollar sandwiches worthy of Vegas's demanding taste buds.
Not that great.. Good but not great.. Would prefer many other restaurants. Not worth the wait.
shit sandwich disgusting and huge line . If you like organic and healthuy walk away !!! insane that they are so successful maybe because of no competition around
Toasted quality sandwiches, good for a quick bite but not worth waiting on the lines I've seen passing by during peak hours. . . Out of the sandwiches I've tried which includes the Full Montagu, Hawaiian BBQ, The original 1762 and Chipotle Chicken Avocado, the Full Montagu was the best.. . The ingredients are tasty but the biggest problem I have with the sandwiches here is that there isn't ever enough filling. The middle is always plump and full of meat and cheese but when you get to the end, you're just eating dry bread.. . I've seen the sandwiches being made and it's on an assembly line. The workers count exactly how many slices of meat and cheese they put on the sandwiches and for each layer of ingredients there's only enough to cover the length of the bread. . . What's with the cheapness, Earl?
It was very good, but I can't say it's anything outrageous. Just a sandwich place that's good and cheaper than most Vegas places. I would go back and try more stuff to give a more detailed review, but for now if you're nearby and don't want to spend a ton of money it's a thumbs up from me.
Lord please bring one of these to New York!!!!. These sandwiches are awesome. . The sandwiches are small but that not a bad thing when you have the best tomato soup ever to go along with it. . . Sandwiches, top notch!. Tomato soup, superb!. Reasonably priced!!!!, specially in Vegas.
5 stars for the chipotle BBQ chicken sandwich!!!! Everything else is good but not all that.
Lines get super long so make sure you get there early enough. Sandwiches are pretty good, especially if you're not looking to spend a load and sit around waiting. Hits the spot.
My go to stop for a quick bite to eat! There's always a line, but for the amount of people they serve, pretty quick. It's great the next day, heated up when you're hungover too! . . I always, always get the full montagu! Yumm, with turkey and roasted beef, Swiss and cheddar cheese, tomatoes and lettuce. What makes it is the mustard sauce that kinda reminds me of honey mustard.. . Tuna is also an honorable mention. Not usually a tuna sandwich fan but this is pretty darn good. Crunchy breads and warm tuna, not fishy at all!. . The clam chowders and tomato soup are also good to warm the tummy. Especially if you're the type to dip your sandwiches in tomato soup, bomb!
Much better sandwich place than the Nosh @ Bally's, probably unfair comparison lol.. . Located Planet Hollywood on left side, don't be intimidated by the long lineups--service is friendly and fast.  Just have to serve your own coffee.. . Ordered the BLT and tuna salad, nicely wrapped.  Not huge like Subway, but just right.  Probably a good thing.  Choice of chowder, which I found the clam one was a bit on the salty side, no repeat here.. . While seating's huge, best to get someone to reserve a table while lining up.
Need a great sandwich quick? This is the place to go.
Well, who can say that Earl of Sandwich is anything less than a 4.5 star place. I love hot sandwiches and these are the best!. . If you are coming all the way to Planet Hollywood for these, then you are like me. Parking in PH sucks though, I have to go through all the shops before getting to the casino. Last time I was there, there was a 40 min line. Given how hard parking had been, I was already priced in.
Always a good joint to go to. Lines are usually long, but worth the wait. Any sandwich is a good pick.
I used to come to Earl of Sandwich on my lunch breaks at Planet Hollywood. This place is sooooo yummy! Every time that I went I was always greated nicely and they always made my order hot and fresh. YUM STATUS!
Most Vegas trips will include at least one baller buffet, but I always also come to Earl's. A great option for a quick, affordable bite to eat, this has been a favorite for many years now.. . To be honest, I never even really liked sandwiches that much until I tried Earl's (Mendo's also gets some credit). Everything I've tried here is legit, but the Full Montague is by far the best.. . It's also super convenient, open 24 hours, so you can eat good food at any time and it's easy on your probably-already-light-wallet from playing too much paigow. During mealtimes, it can get crowded though.. . I haven't tried the Anaheim location yet, but this Vegas one is still a trusty go-to.
AMAZING sandwiches, I come here every time we go to Vegas!
Located in PH by one of the entrances (ask around if you don't know). YUMMY hot sandwiches! Opens 24/7! Great for anytime of the day.. . How to order: Line up, order your hot items, get a buzzer, move down the line, order drinks, pay, find a table, wait for the buzzer to go off, pick up your order, enjoy the food!. . Don't shy away from the long line, it moves fast! Since it does move fast, know what you want to order before it's your turn. Most their sandwiches are less than $7 and it's a rather small portioned sandwich. I do get full from one though. Don't even try to share even with the tiniest of appetite. Thank me later when you don't find yourself lining up in the line and waiting for your second order. I recommend the Chipotle chicken Avocado (sweet and tangy) and/or the Full Montagu. Order a drink because you can get refills. Great to drink when you're outside in the hot sun too.. . It's a must try when you're in Vegas :)
Ugh. I'm having sammich withdrawals right now. After getting a little intoxicated at the amazing Lady Gaga concert, it was time for some food. What other place is always open and reliable at this time of night? Duh. Earl of Sandwich.. . I found a seat as my sister, the loyal Earl's customer, waited in line. We got a Chipotle Chicken Avocado to share. The bread comes to the store half baked then finished to perfection with your order. It was so good! The bacon and avocado was already good by itself but add smoky chipotle sauce? Unf.. . As if anyone even needs my recommendation to come here. I mean, it's difficult for any place to have thousands of review and stay in the 4/5 star range right? So. yeah.
Great affordable meal option in Vegas. The line will look long but it takes no time to order and then to receive your food. Sandwiches are better than all other chain restaurants (quiznos, subway, etc.).
Awesome sandwich for a decent price! I personally like to get the Caprese sandwich with a tomato soup.
Earl of Sandwich isa quick, convenient place to grab a bite while in Vegas. It is relatively affordable compared to other food options on the strip.. . However, I feel like it is merely an overhyped, assembly-line sandwich. I've had their Full Montagu and Philly Steak Sandwiches and there are good, but I've had better.. . Open 24 hours!
Orgasm to my mouth. Earl's never fails me. When I am sober to when I am drunk this sandwich will never let me down! My go to sandwich is the chipotle avocado chicken sandwich. It pretty jam pack with all the ingredients for a 6$ sandwich. Please please listen to me when I say you must order along side a tomato bisque soup! It's the BEST tomato bisque I've ever tasted. So creamy and the croutons they put in it is the cherry on top! Just dunk your sandwich in the cup of soup you won't regret it! Bam!
Pretty BOMB sandwiches I must say myself. I think they just got everything down in one sandwich. Quality is excellent for sure and service is decent. From the bacon to the avocados everything was just right. The salad was nothing special but I can't complain since they aren't the earl of salads. Conveniently located in between planet Hollywood and miracle miles which is awesome when needing a break from that 100 degree weather. I'll be back soon!!
good thing that this place is open 24/7.  sandwiches are decent not the best.. but it'll do the job we got the tuna sandwich and a tomato soup.. and no lines at 6 in the morning is also a plus
I had the Full Montagu, and yea its a sandwich. Nothing more and nothing less. Not special that's for sure. It was a busy afternoon there, and the line was very long which I actually liked because I thought  that maybe it was going to be awesome. When I started on the sandwich I felt extremely disappointed. There was a little buzz about the place so maybe my expectations were too high.
Awesome sandwiches, very affordable. We came here for a quick lunch and it was pretty damn good. It's kind of a food court atmosphere which i didn't care for but, if your just looking for an affordable meal or lunch on the vegas strip this place is great.
Have heard of this place and the deliciousness of its fare and decided to check it out while it Vegas.. . I bought two sandwiches (jerk and chipotle chicken) and a Caesar salad to take away for myself and my boyfriend. Mixed reviews. My jerk chicken sandwich was warm, fresh and utterly delicious. No complaints. My boyfriend however only rated his chipotle average. Likewise the Caesar salad was ordinary at best and I would have liked there to have been more than just a small half-full container of dressing.. . It's definitely worth trying however you and your pocket might be more satisfied with the nearby Subway.
These sandwiches are like little pieces of heaven to me...how could a sandwich taste so amazing?? I still don't understand. I had a couple months between my first and second visit, so I had some time to doubt their deliciousness. I thought, maybe I was just really hungry that last time I went.. . Went back this a.m, took a bite of my Holiday Turkey sandwich - nearly cried from being overjoyed. That's how good they are. Also tried my bf's chipotle chicken avocado: the chicken is unbelievably tender and that chipotle sauce - mmmmm!. . The place always looks crowded when you walk by, but we've never had a problem finding seats.
The soups were awesome, but the wrap I had was very bland. I've definitely had better. Looking back I feel like I should have gotten a sandwich.
5 stars all the way. Everything here is amazing.  I always make it a point to get Earls whenever I am in Vegas.  I make it another thing to get a sandwich before I go back to LA too!. . I always get the tuna melt + tomatoes or/and the chipotle chicken avocado!!! I've also tried the Full Montague, Earls Club -- those were also very tasty but my faves are the tuna and chipotle chicken.. . This is a 24 hour joint so it's perfect after a long night of dancing at the club.  It's also good for the morning after a long night of dancing at the club.  Honestly Earl's sandwich is good any time of the day or night.. . Lines can be long but they move fast, trust me it's worth the wait!!! . . Their mini brownies are so good too! Anything Earls, I am a fan!! A definite must try while in Vegas.
Thanks Yelp. I found this place. Good price and Good taste.. . There's always a line, but for the amount of people they serve, pretty quick. . . I ordered  the full montagu! Yumm, with turkey and roasted beef, Swiss and cheddar cheese, tomatoes and lettuce. The sandwich is good size for me. The salad looks really good. I will come back and try all the other items
After days of self indulgence, we needed something on the healthier side.  We were in the mood for a fresh hearty salad and this place seemed like it might fit the bill.  . . In retrospect, I think the're really more about sandwich (perhaps the name should have clued me in on that?).  Our salads were okay but amounted to an on-the-go salad you would purchase from a grocery store.
