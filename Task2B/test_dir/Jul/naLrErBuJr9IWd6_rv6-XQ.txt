Servers were great and I loved the swivel chairs. I had the porterhouse, wedge salad, pork belly, creamed spinach, potatoes, Mac n cheese, and a samurai cocktail.. . All in all it was fantastic- my only hesitation to give Cut five stars is that it didn't distinguish itself from other comparable steak houses. If you're staying at the Palazzo/Venetian and are looking for a nice steak dinner, there is no need to go any further than Cut.
Went with a large group, the server was awesome. Was able to explain to everyone about what was on the menu. . After the food this is what we all kind of thought of the food. . . ***bone marrow (had a weird texture but don't forget to add the sauce together) . ** smoked salmon (didn't taste as good as I thought it would, I'm used to it being cut in thin slices. This was in chunks) . *** Cesar salad (very refreshing) . ***** Waygu steak. Cooked perfectly! . ***** mac and cheese (big fan of cheese) . **** tuna tartar. (Fresh) . . Will def be coming back for the steak and mac and cheese.
Best steak I've ever had, and the service was amazing! Our waiter made excellent recommendations. Can't wait to visit again.
Let me say the service here is unparalleled.  We had a main server and an assistant.  There were also other people that would come to our table to check on us and offer assistance all throughout the meal.  When my sister asked where the restroom was, a gentleman actually escorted she and my mom to the ladies room.  Nice touch.. . My negative review is for the steak/kitchen.  We ordered our steaks medium well.  We received them medium rare.  No big deal.  We sent them back to be cooked a little longer but what we then received was a charred MESS!!  I mean my steak was completely black!!  You could not cut the top of the steak with the knives they provided!!  CRAZINESS!!   And to top it all the inside was STILL red!  I have never had a steak come out to me looking like that.  There was no excuse.  . . My family and I were there to celebrate my sisters birthday.  We previously had an awesome experience there so we wanted to re-create that wonderful night.  Well it's true, you can't go home again because this time the kitchen truly screwed up.  The flavor of the meat was fine but trying to eat that bitter char on top was not working for me.  Truly ridiculous.  2 of the steaks we just sent back and did not get a replacement because of time, we had already sent the steak back once.  So a couple of us just ate sides for my sisters birthday dinner.  . . The management did provide desserts on the house.  That was nice of them but really we just wanted to get out of there before the deli closed :-/  We were hungry!!!. . I loved CUT so much the first visit that I would have loved to give it more than 1 star this time.   Again the service was impeccable.  The atmosphere is chic and welcoming.  But seriously, the person that burnt those steaks up is ridiculous and should not be in a kitchen.  Even on my stove at home I wouldn't have demolished a steak that way.  I understand that everyone makes mistakes but that was terrible.    Only thing redeeming about the visit was the excellent service and the way it was handled.  But you make reservations for a special occasion simply for the atmosphere.  I wanted good food.
Bobby was an amazing server. Very knowledgable about the menu and very attentive. The food was excellent, we shared a porterhouse steak. Done to perfection and the sauces were delicious. Great place to eat in Vegas!
I got the Waygu beef and it was the most amazing meal I've ever had!!  Lame that I had the most amazing meal of my life when I wasn't hungry, but on well.. . I love Mario Batelli's restaurant Carnevino and had their steak the very next day for lunch (I know, how much steak can one girl have in 24 hours) anyways, it just did not compare. I'm aware that Waygu beef is completely different so it's not a fair comparison to Carnevino but hey that's my comment. :)
5 stars!!!!! I have never been this impressed and frankly this is way above what I am used to.  The wife and I wanted to do something nice and WOW this was it. . . The service was top of the line and a 5 star dinning experience!!! Everything was perfect. I am almost at a loss of words to tell you how perfect everything was.. . We shared the 34 ounce porter house and I was the BEST steak I have ever had!!! I eat a tone of steak and this was phenomenal! We also had a side of bacon potatoes and they were amazing as well. If you want to go some place amazing and romantic while in Vegas this is it. . . My two little tips.....1) Make sure you make a reservation, even on a week day or you will not get in. . 2) Bring your money!! For just the wife and I it was about $230, but worth every penny
I didn't know much about the restaurant before we went as another member of our group had made the recommendation/reservation. It was a fabulous night with delicious food. . Four (out of six) of us got the wagyu beef. I got the petit filet and still couldn't finish it with all of the sides we ordered. The steak had a wonderful crispy outside. Slicing the meat was a smooth as slicing butter. Every bite was decadent. I did enjoy trying the mustards with the beef.. We got the bacon potatoes as a side -- again so very rich. The only thing I wasn't wowed by was the creamed spinach...I've had better. Another friend had ordered the mac and cheese. I had a bite, but was so full that I felt I couldn't totallyenjoy it...I do recall it was flavorful.. The service and presentation was top notch. . I would highly recommend The Cut to anyone...it's pricey, but totally worth it. Best steak I have ever eaten!
This steakhouse is one of my favorite out here. . . The ambiance is so modern and clean. Food I had the Wagyu which just melts. in your mouth.  Definitely a must go!
Excellent service! Food was only ok. This place was definitely over priced for the quality and amount of the food. The presentation on the apps and sides were nice, but the entrees were definitely lacking. Going back to the sides with the entree, they were very small, even the fries. $12 for a half bowl of fries was a bit ridiculous, since there was nothing special about them. I understand the $24 for the side of mushrooms, since they are special mushrooms, as for the rest, over priced. I'm not saying the food was bad, I'm saying the food was not as gourmet as you should expect. If they could get the food up to the level of their service, they would have a 5 star restaurant.
The food was great, but the service seemed really disorganized! Our reservation was at 8:45, but we didnt get seated until 9:30. That's a long time! I had the reservation for a couple of months, so I was really disappointed by that. Once we sat down, they comped us two apps. Nice, but for 11 people that were really hungry? Not really a dent. We ordered and then got our apps pretty soon after. Then, we waited. And waited. And waited. Another 45 minutes later we got our entrees! The food was really really good. But I was so tired, and actually not really in the mood to eat anymore! The server was nice and felt bad, but honestly, nothing can make up for waiting so long both those times. I don't think I will be back.
This was my second time eating at cut. Once again settings is very elegant. The service was spectacular. We went with another couple who ordered bone in ribeye. The hitting the top sirloin bone in ribeye the last time ( their be expensive option). I did not find it nearly as good last time we ate here. My family stay to be ordinary not special. I get a Bernese sauce on it was excellent. However last time we were here the steak was of such qualities it is not needed. The vegetables on the side where at standing. Awkward to play with also really outstanding. I guess my take home message is to order the expensive cut at this restaurant rather than d least expensive. Still it was a wonderful dining experience.
A place for great steaks. The room is noisy, so it's not for a quiet night. The service is great. The steak choices and quality are hard to beat. If you can only go to one Puck fine dining spot, I'd suggest Spago. If you want steak, this is a great choice.
Fantastic steak and ambience. One of my favorite places to dine in Las Vegas. You won't be disappointed with the American Wagyu filet. The Mac and Cheese was also fantastic.
One of the best meals. We had the Wagyu filet mignon and rib eye, both were melt in the mouth great. Also lamb chops were excellent. Service was par excellence
I have been to the Beverly Hills location once and this was my second time in LV.  Although the food was good, I did not leave with a spectacular feeling this time. . . We were seated next to a vey loud table.  I realize this is Vegas, but for these prices you expect to screen out that crowd.  . . The pork belly and tuna  starters were delicious.  Frankly, the starters were better than the porterhouse for two.  The fries were disappointing this time and I would not get them again.  The cream spinach was delicious as usual.   . . Will I go back, probably.  However I think I may just stop by for a cocktail and have a nosh at the bar.
Verdens beste biff?. . Den var sa bra at jeg har ikke tort a dra tilbake selv om jeg har vrt i Vegas mange ganger etterpa. Redd for a delegge minnene.. . Forutsetningene var de beste. En kamerat skulle feire rundt ar, og han spanderte pa oss. Kona var akkurat sendt hjem, og gutteturen hadde startet. Etter middagen her hadde vi bottle service/bord pa nattklubb pa nabohotellet Wynn.. . Med andre ord: stemningen var god og gutta var klare for biff. Stemningen ble ikke darligere av at kelnerne kom til bordet med kjttstykkene og fortalte om hvert enkelt valg - hvor de kom fra og hvordan kjttet hadde blitt oppbevart.. . Jeg er den som liker biffer med mye smak, sa det ble rib-eye (entrecote) pa meg. Noen av de andre bestilte PorterHouse, husker jeg.. . Kort fortalt er dette den beste biffopplevelsen jeg har hatt i mitt liv, og jeg har etterhvert vrt pa en del gode biffrestauranter utenlands. . . Er du i Vegas og har lyst pa en ordentlig god biff, kan jeg ikke tenke meg at Cut blir feil a beske. Wolfgang Puck har gjort noe riktig her. Selv om det finnes mange gode steak house pa stripa (og down town for den saks skyld), har jeg til gode a spise pa noen som er like gode som denne.
This place is modern. Dimmed lights, waiting area with flat screen tv. Ambience is gorgeous. The staff and service was excellent.. . So we got an introduction on their meat selection. Boy it was like going to college to learn how to eat meat. Lol. The cuts, the beef brands and style. I was a little overwhelmed but loved the education.. . I ordered the braised beef ribs that came with two different sauce that was served already on the dish. One of the sauce was a curry Indian spice sauce and it was overpowering with a second sauce that was green. That one was tart as lime or lemon like. The combination of the two sauce was weird and did not compliment the braised short rib. I ate the ribs by it self. Pretty good by it self.. . The sides were good but very small. I did get the chocolate souffle. The souffle was delicious without the small ball of ice cream. The extra chocolate sauce was ok. A little tangy. The souffle by it self was excellent. Sometimes, simpler is better.. . We did have a large party. The prices here is steep. On the way out, I saw my brother's shirt and it had a stained. The steak for 2 were sliced and cut infront of you. The cutter must have dripped some of the juices from the steak into the back of his shirt. Lol. That I thought was a little reckless. But hey, it's suppose to be a fine dinning experience. . . My break down of my rating:. . Ambience 5 star. Service 5 star. Food 3 star. Sides 4 star. Desert 4 star
Clearly hands down best steak restaurant anywhere!!!  Great atmosphere...lounge but classy.  Great service.  Never disappoint.
Let me preface by saying this place is very expensive. The service is terrific. Even though the place was packed it was almost like having your own personal waiter. I've been to some of the finest restaurants in NY, LA etc but this place is over the top as far as service. The food, everything from the appetizer, steaks to the dessert was beyond excellent. One minor negative. The side sauces really didn't compliment the steaks and why would someone put these sauces on such fine steaks is beyond me. I must say it was the best steak I ever had. I would say the experience was a orgasmic experience.
