So here is a deal on a nudge of @AnthonyP (oh this is not twitter?) I decided to review a 4th place on Yelp since I have been a member as of late 2008.   I believe I went here w my sister like the first year they were open or was it just me not remembering any details I have no idea.  Anyway we got here first time pretty early or it was holiday so they weren't open yet or something like that years ago. Then we came back and everything was pretty much taken and it was so busy. I loved the decor and the feel of the place that puts you into a storybook or some other space and time.  I also thought I would see a ghost of some kind, but it all went well ( this is not Hollywood either).  So I reserve this place especially in my heart for its old wooden floors and the decor and lots and lots of flowers.  Hmmm that is what I remember anyways, half the stuff is prob made up. #reviewno4
There are a lot of cozy and charming little houses in Phoenix converted into a restaurant.  Cibo is one of them.  We went there for lunch and service was prompt and friendly.  Pomo Pizzeria (the VPN certified pizzeria in Scottsdale & Phoenix) used to be my number one pizza place, but Cibo has won me over!  You can taste the quality ingredients and everything is absolutely delicious!  . . What we ordered:. Salmone Sandwich. Cold sandwich consisting of smoked salmon, cream cheese, sprouts, arugula, and capers. Served on an amazing saltimbocca bread that's baked fresh with every order in their wood burning oven!  Comes with delicious garden salad sprinkled with pine nuts.  Absolutely fabulous sandwich!  Healthy too!. . Polpette Sandwich. Homemade meatballs in tomato sauce with melted mozzarella.  Served on an amazing saltimbocca bread that's baked fresh with every order in their wood burning oven! Perfect sandwich with oozing cheese!  Yum!. . Diavola Pizza. Lunch size pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella and spicy salame.  Very good!. . Di Notte Pizza. Fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola, mozzarella and spicy salame.  Their crust is perfectly thin, chewy, and crispy.  Puffed up on the side like they should be, and absolute delight to eat!
Quaint atmosphere, amazing food, great wine and service was right up there too!  Nice place to relax before a game or concert down town.
LOVED IT!! Probably the best meatball I have ever had! . . Great atmosphere and their pizza is one point! . . Can't wait to go back!
The food is always amazing, but I think it gets better every time I come in. The Rustica pizza is to die for and good for two people. Also, you must try their Nutella and Mascarpone crepe (it's crack). The service is good without being annoying. They make sure you have everything you need, and then actually leave you alone so you can enjoy your meal. Over all, extremely satisfying.
Cute, cozy restaurant in downtown Phoenix. Nice alternative to waiting hours to get into Pizzeria Bianco. The pizza here was delicious, with yummy varieties to choose from. I haven't tried the regular italian food on the menu, but I've heard it's good as well.
Probably the best pizza in thevalley!  This was my favorite place to go for pizza when living in Phoenix. Very charming setting. We especially loved to bring our dog here and sit outside. Fantastic service. Romantic but relaxed vibe. They also have delicious pastas, salads, and appetizers if you are in the mood for something other than pizza.  Get the nutella shake for dessert!
This place used to be better but unfortunately- it's going down hill. The food is bland. The chicken in their salads especially. I used to like it, but now I have no reason to go back.
This place is always amazing, every time I go.  The burrata is to die for and I order it as soon as I sit down.  If you don't get there semi early though, they typically run out by 6 or 7 on Fridays and Saturdays.  All of the pizzas I've had are super tasty, with local ingredients for toppings.  My favorite has to be the Diavolo with ricotta.  The salami has a nice spicy kick and the ricotta balances it out nicely.  Its a little warm during the summer, as most of the seating is outside.  But once the sun goes down and they turn on the decorative lighting, you forget you're in downtown Phoenix.  I'd recommend this place over Pizzeria Bianco anytime.  Half the wait and twice as good.
Awesome neighborhood place. Beautiful patio, cozy atmosphere, and, most importantly, great food. I love the pizza, but the sandwiches atlunch (which are made with wood fired pizza dough bread) are unbeatable. I only wish I could get those sandwiches at dinner...
This place is too small and the pizza is not memorable. I tried a shot of lemoncello and it was terrible and way too thick.
Awesome atmosphere and great place to eat outside when weather is good. Very cool downtown location and great food. The crepes and pizza are awesome. Good service and pricing is affordable.
Was a great spot that I was glad I stopped in to grab a quick bite while in Phoenix on business. Definitely will be back if I'm ever in the area!
awesome pizza,  great ambiance,   friendly service,  I would highly recommend this spot
So this place did a lot right, and only miss steeped a few times-plus very good food. . . The servos was great! Very good recommendations and follow through. Server even suggested a change to my pizza that the staff enjoys-it reallymade it nice. The problem with it was once she checked on my beer choice that was the lady time I saw her until I was completely finished. Small mistake to an almost perfect meal.. . The food was insane-very tasty!! The pizza combined typical Flavors of fresh sauce and cheese with pepperoni with less used ingredients of blue cheese and raw garlic. Crust had a perfect chewiness. Very good.. . There beer selection was ok-really would have preferred a draft selection but they did have great selection of local bottled beers.. . All in all a nice meal
Love this place!  Within walking distance and offers gluten free crust.
After shredding downtown with the little lady we decided to check out this quaint little restaurant. First, their is a lot of outside seating. The ambiance outside is very nice as well. The inside is smaller but nicely decorated. This is a great place for dates or romantic one-on-ones. Our meals were great. We had the calamari, a pizza, and a wood fired sandwich. . . Pros. - great ambiance. - good food. - decent prices. . Cons . - limited inside seating. - just okay service. - parked in the back. Trash bin was overflowing and smell turned us off.
Delicious food, wonderful atmosphere, owners were very nice and helpful, service was great.  Enjoyed it with another couple, but could be a great romantic date place too. Will definitely make this a regular on our list of favorite restaurants.
My favorite pizza in Phoenix, plus it is super romanic.
I hate to be critical, but really this restaurant needs to step it up. There are so many excellent urban pizzerias in the Phoenix area and this one fails in comparison. Our server was quite friendly and prompt, however it was hard to keep track of the service because we were so busy swatting flies off of our indoor table.  We ordered what the server recommended and the pizzas arrived within five minutes. The flavors were bland and the crust was soggy and wet-so much so that we did not finish our order and definitely did not take any leftovers home.  We were looking forward to advertised interesting flavor combinations and pizza that would keep is coming back. Although the decor was trendy and the patio seems accommodating and cozy, we will not be returning.
Fantastic location, ambiance, food, and beer selection.  I can't speak for the wine, but it looked good as well.  This place is definitely worth the visit, and you'll probably come back for the more traditionally prepared Italian pies with things like prosciutto and oil/pesto based sauces.
Cibo is excellent! The atmosphere, service, and food are all spectacular. Also prices are very reasonable. Patio is great as well, especially with the live music. Blows bianco out of the water, plus you don't have to wait two hours. Also great location, very homey. I take all out of towners here. Great for date night!
The best pizza there is.
My new favorite place in Downtown Phoenix!!!! Late night dinner we decided to check this place out and OMG I'm so glad we did! The server a pretty blonde was extra helpful and on point! (Too bad I didn't get her name) she answered all our questions and advised us on some items! I just completely fell in love! The place itself is a cute looking house, you walk and are greeted immediately, the wait wasn't long for a Thursday night... I'd so come again very very soon! . . We ordered the Arancini as an appetizer and I'm so craving it right now! It's a must try!!!. . The pizza was delicious and the desert was to die for!
Probably don't have more to add other then AWESOME!. Went with a friend for lunch and was so pleased. Been waiting to go for a couple of years, but living in way north valley, wasn't convenient.. So happy I had the opportunity! It was great.
My mother-in-law took us here when our friend from Japan was visiting. I would definitely go back! The service was excellent, and the food was, of course, delicious! We had a cheese platter, two pizzas (I don't remember what kind, but they were good!), and awesome drinks. Our server was friendly, had great suggestions, and was very patient with us. Oh, and the atmosphere was great -- very warm and inviting. Overall, we were very satisfied.
Great sandwiches and outdoor vibe. Could use more outdoor seating, but all in all, a good place.
Great date night.  Staff was easy to work with and the food is tasty.  They do have a patio if you'd prefer sitting outside.. . ***** (5 Stars)- Amazing, zero flaws, a must go! (Not given often). . **** (4 Stars)- Memorable, strongly feel you should visit. . *** (3 Stars)- Above average, worth a visit. . ** (2 Stars)- Average, some pro's and some con's. . * (1 Star)- Opinion is do not go, below average
This place can do no wrong. Everything I've ever eaten here has been amazing! Not only that they have great servers and carry Lemoncello!
Place is awesome. Have been there for lunch during the week as well as the weekend. Never lets me down.  Probably some of the best pizza I have had.
