Great food!  BBQ pizza and fontina burger wonderful.  Need more places like this closer to home!
SO GOOD! . Haven't been disappointed once.. Usually go for linner (lunch/dinner) and always leave rubbing my belly in fullness and cursing my overeating - but I can't help it- wow its jammin'. . Came here for breakfast on a recent visit and was impressed as well. Fresh and yummy and great ambiance. I love the farm feel and the staff is always friendly!
Main Points:. -Great casual fare for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. -Unique venue, fun to bring visitors. . Review:. I'm giving this place 5 stars, because in the category of casual food, this place is great! They have some tasty burgers and flatbread pizza that'll leave you full, garlic fries that are totally addicting, and delightful shakes.  . . My absolute favorite menu pick to get at Joe's is their waffles and ribs on their breakfast menu.  I'm not even a waffle person but their waffles are perfection, lightly crispy on the outside and salty sweet.  Add ribs on top, and it's pure deliciousness in your mouth! . . Finally, the venue itself is a fun atmosphere with picnic tables amongst the shade trees, plenty of grassy area for kids to enjoy, and quirky bathrooms. Note that if it's too hot/cold outside, there is inside seating as well. Just be aware that when there's great weather, lines can get  long but they seem to move pretty fast and you can always call your order in for pick-up. If great tasting casual fare is what you're looking for, then Joe's Farm Grill won't disappoint!
I understand that Joe's Farm Grill is very popular as a result of Diners, Drive-Ins,& Dives, but after going a couple of times, I fail to understand all the hype.. . I've had both the Farm Chicken Sandwich & the BBQ Chicken Flatbread. The sandwich was not that great; I ordered it with American cheese & grilled onions ... & the fries that it came with left much to desire as they were ridiculously salty & greasy. The flatbread was not a much better alternative.. . The price isn't worth the quality & the restaurant is out of the way from everything so I don't see myself making the drive out there much. Also, most of the seating is outdoors & there are a lot of flies. 2 stars is even being a little generous but it's nice to know they use local ingredients from the farm.
I judge a place by their food, definitely, but even more by how they handle their mistakes.  They recently did a to go order for me, and by the time I got home (far) I found they got my order very wrong. Called them up, and they quickly offered either a full refund or gift card. No questions asked, just the credit, an apology, and an invite to come back. . I will absolutely be back.
You can not find a better burger & sweet potato fries! Wonderful vibe and the employees are top notch!
This is one of my favorite lunch places as a vegetarian! I order the veggie burger and sweet potatoes fries  and am never disappointed.
Very expensive for what you get. The food is pretty good. The pizzas are good and so is the breakfast. But $45 for dinner for 3 is crazy at a place where you have to go outside to get your refills.. . I reccomend tskingvyour food to go because the whole restaurant is filled with flies and its pretty gross.
I got their shrimps and they were huge. Each shrimps were honestly the sizes of two adult male index and middle fingers together. The food were great, good fresh squeeze lemonade, and nice atmosphere.
This place is casual, perfect place for the hipsters. I got the Cesar salad and zucchini rounds! I cannot say enough good....it's so delicious!!! This is a place I will continue to visit, it looks and taste fresh!
I would give 3 1/2 if I could and for the most part, this a 4-5 star biz, but lacks a few key components to achieve the overall ranking.. . The venue:. (1) Great modern, trendy decor, makes for an entertaining experience visually. (2) You can't help but feel some what cool for eating here because it puts off this "I'm a cool place" vibe which is a kick for a totally lame, wholly settled down father/husband like myself. (3) The grounds are great from the huge trees, wide open spaces, backing a farm, and all the grass, it's all pretty awesome. . So why the 3 1/2 stars, place sounds great, right? It's the food. It's so hit and miss we hardly come here anymore. I'm telling you, one day it knocks it out of the park across the board and the next time it's less than average and we have had just about everything on the menu. Understand, their prices aren't outrageous but it is not up to par with quality half of the time so that is why we have reduced our visits.. . Please note, Joe's is always great for a free birthday meal, in fact, on some birthdays we'll hit up Joe's for lunch, Joe's BBQ for diner and Liberty Market for desert, all on the house for the birthday celebrator. Also, if we are ever entertaining any out of towners, this is routinely a stop at some point.
Two and a half stars... Nothing overly wrong with Joe's Farm Grill, but nothing special either. . . I've had lots of people recommend Joe's, so I was looking forward to my first trip out to Mesa to have breakfast with my sons there. My first issue was simply that I went in the middle of summer, and at 8:15 it was already hot out, and all the inside tables were taken. By the time we got our food and ate it, i was more focused on finishing and getting out of the heat, than enjoying my breakfast. None of this is really Joe's fault, but if you haven't been there, you should be warned that the majority of the seating is outdoors. . . Secondly, I wasn't really able to enjoy my meal anyway, because of the many flies swarming around our heads and plates. I was constantly shaking them off me and trying to sweep them away from my kids' food. Again, I get it... It's a farm atmosphere, it's outdoors... But be aware if that kind of thing isn't your thing. . . As for the food, it was nothing nearly as memorable as the fly situation. . . Steve had the kid's eggs and bacon. A couple of eggs scrambled (I wasn't given an option to get them any other way) and thin cut bacon served in a paper French fry tray. The eggs were a little over cooked and "tight"' so they were sitting in a small pool of egg water. The bacon was closer to under-cooked and flaccid. The eggs were seasoned and didn't taste bad. The bacon is described as "Apple cider smoked", but it didn't taste any different than mid-grade supermarket bacon. . . Sam had the waffle and fruit. Right off the bat, it looked the most appealing. A malty, Belgian-style waffle with about a half cup of ripe berries and some whipped cream. No complaints, but nothing magic either. It's not hard to make a waffle, and a bit pricey for what you get at $7 bucks. . . I had the Breakfast Burger. It's an average sized, somewhat thin, griddled burger with one over-easy egg (again, I was not asked how I would like it cooked), two slices of the same bacon, and cheese. It was served with lettuce, tomato and pickles, which I didn't use, and a choice of breakfast sides. I asked for Farm Beans, and got breakfast potatoes. The potatoes are  a small portion of those factory sanded, pre-cooked potato cubes, and perhaps my biggest disappointment. When I read "Farm Grill", I think skillet made home fries, not Aramark fast food. At $10 bucks, definitely not a solid value. . . Again, for those who haven't been there, the food is ordered fast food-style at a window, and you're given a pager to notify you when it's ready. It's not served fast food-style other than the paper plates and plastic-ware, because it took 21 minutes for the pager to buzz. . . Overall, it's mediocre breakfast fare, somewhat over priced for what you get (a few pennies under $40 for two kids sized portions and one adult), served in what could be a nice atmosphere if it weren't for the heat and the flies. . . It seems like the place might have potential, and it's gotten generally good reviews, so if I happen to be out on the east side on a cooler spring or fall day, I might be tempted to give Joe's a second chance.
Get the sweet potato fries and a burger. You will not be disappointed. Of course, there's something on the menu for everyone. My girlfriend loves the ahi tuna salad; it's not exactly my style, but it is damn good nonetheless. If you're planning on popping in at peak lunch or dinner time, expect a line, but it's totally worth the wait.
Both my wife and I ordered burgers. I had the pesto burger as seen on triple d and she had the cheeseburger with sauteed onions. I had the onion rings and she had the garlic fries. To be honest I expected more from the burger that was featured, it was ok, I was not blown away by it. However, the onion rings and fries were the bomb! My wife enjoyed her burger as well. Will return for sure.
This place was AWESOME, wow I was impressed. . . I came here because I say the yelp reviews (700+) and I was in the neighborhood which is on the WAY east side. The inside is super unique and cool. This is a semi-fast kind of joint, order at the window but boy is it worth it. . . I had the Fontina Burger, and is was phenomenal!!! Every bite made my salivary glands kick into action. I had a similar feeling when eating at DMK in Chicago. (not comparing to DMK but similar feeling). I would def recommend this place and a place to show people. . . Enjoy.
This is my new favorite hamburger joint.  I have driven past many times and finally had the opportunity to give it a try this past weekend.  AS you can see from the 700 plus reviews...this place is popular.  The line was long but went very quickly.  My husband ordered a hot dog and fries and I went with a burger and onion rings.  In really thought it all was very tasty!  I LOVE the atmosphere here...from the diner type of appeal to the farm feel as you pull in.  I can't wait til it cools off a bit as sitting outside seems perfect.  Nothing fancy here....but calm and casual...my cup of tea! . . The  coffee shop next door looks great as well so that may be my next venture.  the family also owns Joe's real BBQ and Liberty Market.  I may venture over to Liberty Market as well ..it seems they have this food thing down.. . Side note, I spoke with the mgr while we were there and while I forget his name, I have to say, the guy hustles and is also so friendly...opening doors for people and stopping to say Hi, but not in an annoying way....
