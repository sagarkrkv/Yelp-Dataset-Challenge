Really dig the open patio style seating that Julian Serrano has going on.. . Since we had a group of 5, we ordered the regular sized Mixed Paella to start since it was going to take awhile, and just ordered a bunch of tapas to share.  Even though on the menu it shows the paella's portion is for two, with all the tapas we ordered, turned out to be a smart choice.  . . The paella came loaded with seafood.  Paella's tasty and it definitely hit the spot for us.  Can't really compare to "authentic" paella, but for what it is, pretty good!  One of my friend mentioned that the seafood wasn't as fresh as it could be, which is understandable since Vegas is in the middle of the desert haha.  My only knock on it would probably be the super small lobster tail.. . As for the tapas, there were a few standouts.  The Black Rice is my favorite: squid Ink rice/risotto with calamari and lobster, with a heavy touch on garlic, which I liked.  Others that stood out were the White Ceviche, which was refreshing, and the Apple Foie, which is a mini apple roasted with a chunk of foie in the middle.  C'mon.. . The Fresh Calamari a la Plancha was a surprise.  Essentially grilled calamari, but done perfectly.  The Beef Tartare here has an interesting presentation.  Tasty too to match the good looks. . . Pan Tomate was a disappointment and didn't care much for the Stuffed Piquillo Peppers.  . . We ordered a pitcher of red sangria to share, which was good for about 8-9 glasses.  Solid solid sangria.. . Seating was a bit awkward when I was checking in for my reservation.  There was a group of Chinese tourists in front of us and the host must've thought we were together so didn't pay any attention until I grabbed her attention.  Besides that, service was fantastic.  Our server was fantastic... but unfortunately forgot his name.
Ordered $39 for an ounce and a half of Pata Negra w raw tomato and 4 slices of ciabatta. I understand it's acorn fed and meant to be delicious, but SHIT!  $10+ for dates wrapped in bacon covered in more sweet shit.. Stiff undercooked rice advertised as creamy mushroom risotto. menu sounded delicious. New York.. tasted sous vide..? Please trim the excess silver skin before cooking.  Might want to retrain your cooks. Ambience was great. Kind of empty. Staff was friendly if that floats your boat for a great restaurant.
Best place I've eaten in Vegas so far. Great food and great service. Everything we had was tasty, but highlights were the Tuna/raspberry and the duck confit. The rice pudding dessert was a must have. Best part of the meal. The service was attentive, but relaxed. As a woman paying the bill when dining with two men, I appreciated that the server actually looked at the name on the credit card and handed it back to me for signatures. The only drawback to this place is that it is very loud, with a dance music backdrop, so if you aren't up for that ambiance you should consider going elsewhere.
Can't beat the location.  Prime people watching place. Our meal was great. Man, the Espana's really love the quality of their sauces.  I really liked the different cheese platter menu too.  Overall, a great place with different type of Espana food.  Good for groups. Can make this a light fare if you are planning to party later.
Absolutely love this place, from the ambience to the delicious dishes! The pitchers of sangria along with tasty Brava potatoes and tuna cones are a must try!  Our server Yoshi took great care of us. I recommend this place to anyone that comes to vegas!
This is the first restaurant I've been to in Vegas that wasn't a buffet, earls or pizza. And I have to tell everyone who have only been to those places to branch out and try some of the fine dining vegas has to offer.. . I was staying in Aria and it was my friend's birthday so we decided to splurge a little bit on a celebration dinner. We had 8 people with us and we were able to get seated right away with our reservation. The first thing our waiter recommended to us was the sangria. That definitely did not disappoint - it was strong enough to get me buzzed with just two glasses.. . We got a variety of dishes:. . 1. Raspberry Tuna - SO GOOD. it wasn't overwhelmingly fishy and the raspberry added a nice texture. The presentation was nice too. (comes in 4). . 2. Creamy Risotto - this was probably the best dish of the night. Everyone on yelp raves about this dish, and it was my favorite. Super filling and enough for 4 people to share (unless you're a manly man that eats whole cows for dinner, then you may need 4 plates).. . 3. Lobster noodle dish - not sure what it was called, but I didn't particularly like this one. Reminds me of chow mein done wrong.. . 4. Seafood ceviche - Delicious! recommended for anyone who likes ceviche, can't really say too much about it other than it was good.. . 5. Ox Tail - i was pleasantly surprised about this one! so good and rich, a good meat dish since we ordered mostly seafood.. . A thing to note is that these are tapas and the portions are small. We paid about 40 dollars a person which I felt was really affordable with the quality of food and presentation. I was also pretty full after the meal - wasn't stuffed, but who wants to be if they're planning on going out for the rest of the night.
Everything I ordered from here was delicious.  Our waiter was awesome too bad I forgot his name.  Tapas are the way to go if you don't feel like having a big meal before you head out to a show or club.
The girls and I are still talking about and craving the food from this place... I left my heart at Julian Serrano's last week sigh. . We were promptly seated and service was truly memorable. Started off with a pitcher of sangria and proceeded to order a series of tapas. Everything tasted fresh and savory. Dishes that sounded spicy actually came out SPICY (which I always appreciate)... . Here's what we ordered and loved (4 girls): . - beef tartare. - grilled octopus. - fried calamari. - stuffed peppers . - ceviche. - grilled salmon . - stuffed peppers  . - some potato/jalapeno skewer. - chorizo . . Sangria was nice and strong :) helped wash down all the various flavors. Hope I can come back!
We went to Julian Serrano on our first night at the Aria and we really enjoyed it. The service was very good and the food was excellent. The menu is huge.. . We ordered the Paella Serrano (with morcilla, short ribs and kale), the apple with foie grass, the lobster gazpacho and the bread with tomatoes. For dessert I ordered the bunuelos. Everything was outstanding but the bread with tomatoes -which we are very used to eat in Spain- were to oily and the bread was too soft for our taste. . . If you ask me between Jose Andres and Julian Serrano, I couldn't pick one over the other, regardless of my 3 and 4 stars respectively. They are just not the same, the food is different. I did find Jose Andres to be more intricate.
They have a vegan and vegetarian menu which is GREAT!. Good food, great service.  The standout was the spanish/vegetarian pizza thing.  That dish was unique and delicious (it was like a moulette).  . The rest of the dishes were solid.  Nothing stood out ( I had mostly vegetarian options like patatas bravas and veggies).  The only disappointment was the the green peppers--the oil they used just didn't add enough good flavor.  These are my favorite tapas so I've had them at a lot of places and these were just not up to the standards of other places.. Overall, each dish was good but only one was special.. I did not like the Sangria that much.  . Service was great.. I would come back here when I come back to town but not sure I'd recommend it as a must go to.
Love this place. MANY items to choose from. We opted for tapas instead of large dishes but next time we'll be trying a paella (be aware it takes 40 minutes to prepare if you order one).. we had:. -croquettas (probably the best thing we had. just delicious sweetness. They have a happy hour where you can buy them for $4 instead of $10). -gambas (basically shrimp in a spicy sauce....the one dish i could have gone without. The shrimp seemed overcooked and dry....and that's even with the sauce). -calamari (my wife had this and loved it. I'm not a huge calamari guy so i passed. She's very picky about calamari and thought it was a solid dish). -bombas (pork and beef meatball. Be aware these are SPICY. Delicious though. And the sauces? please. I still have dreams about it). -pistachio tart dessert (omg....this was so much better than we expected it to be. you MUST try it. it's not even like a tart. It's more like a very thin cake. Just incredible. I could have eaten 4 more.. . Definitely worth a try. There were maybe 10 other things we wanted to try. It would be a perfect place to try with a big group because you could try almost everything on the menu.
Amazing food. Must try the beef tartar and the squid ink. Wish I could go right now!
Excellent option for happy hour (4pm - 5:30pm) in the Aria! . . Get that sparkling sangria for $5. Good stuff. The happy hour dishes aren't huge by any means, but we ordered 4 dishes & that was a good enough start to our evening (3 people) so we could get to gambling and eat a late dinner!
I love their paella! And I am very happy with their food! The foie gras (in the middle of a mini apple) is just fantastic and it melt in you mouth!. I will definitely come back!
What a disappointment!  Expected so much from Serrano.  Service was shoddy and inept.  Food that we ordered was forgotten -- and what we did get was delivered to the table in an incredibly disorganized/haphazard fashion.  And the food was pretty much flavorless and dried out.
Amazing tapas in Las Vegas! Pricey but well worth it. Make sure to get the lamb chop, a pitcher of the white sangria and the the ahi tuna tapas. Everything we ate was amazing and the atmosphere was really great. Will be back next time in Vegas!
Service was wonderful! Food was tasty!. . Had the paella and it fed me and the wife no problem. Price wasn't bad too, for Vegas.
Came here for Sunday lunch during Restaurant Week. Courteous staff, got seated right away. No issue with our toddler as they had high chairs available. . . The $30 lunch menu was very satisfying. For starters we had the Wild mushroom soup and Lobster gazpacho. The latter is good for those who like sour flavors and can enjoy cold soup like me. We also got their Calamari which was perfect with the aioli sauce. For the main course we had Rib-eye steak and Garlic chicken. Both had ample servings (considering this is a tapas place) and good flavor. The Flan with raspberry cream and Santiago's almond cake with Turon ice cream were perfect desserts to cap the meal. . . Overall very happy with experience and very good value for your money.
I like the large selection of tapas.  My husband and I tried many several different plates, 1-2 from each section.  Favorites are deep dried artichoke and the foie gras.  The deep fried beignets (bunuelos) were delicious!
It is so good to see tapas come to the strip. Small plates are trending now in a lot of restaurants. Small plates means people can eat and share more different foods. The variety of it all is what attracts me. I'm not coming here to just eat my meat and potatoes. I can have a little bit of this, a little of that, and in the end of it all, I had a bite of more that what I would normally have in a single day. Julian Serrano made his mark with Masa's Restaurant in San Fransisco. Opening Picasso in Las Vegas in the Bellagio, his Vegas restaurant was the recipient of 2 Michelin stars and a AAA Five Diamond Award. With all these accolades, it was time for Julian Serrano to venture out into other things. Looking at the trends of restaurants and being of Spanish decent, tapas was an obvious choice. I like tapas because you can order a lot of food at one time, and this we did.. . The brava potatoes was a popular item so we started off with these. They were small nuggets of fried potatoes - the outside was golden and crispy, and the inside was fluffy. The spicy tomato puree on top was a nice acidic sauce. The aioli sauce on top was fatty and smooth -- It all was a nice combination. Stabbing these fried nuggets with a skewer, the sauce had a perfect taste and balance for the potatoes. I would order these again. They were simple and delicious.. . The grilled angus flat iron steak was a nice accompaniment to the potatoes. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, the steak was meaty and had a nice chewy consistency -- kind of like flank steak. The japanese eggplant was a unique condiment, and the mushroom demi-glace gave it a nice earthy note. It was a perfect cut of meat and the flavors worked nicely.. . It seems like every tapas restaurant has stuffed dates. The one at Julian Serrano was mediocre in my opinion. Though the dates were huge, almost too big, all the other ingredients were missing. The almond was barely noticed, and the wrapping of the applewood bacon was lost. With the panko crusted fried exterior, the flavors were kind of single noted, even when dipped in the spicy piquillo pepper sauce. Maybe the dates large size gave it too much of a sweet taste, but the saltiness of the bacon could have been more pronounced.. . Yeah, the brava potatoes were delicious, but more fried potatoes couldn't hurt. The huevos estrellados had a bed of fried topped with imported spanish pork chorizo and eggs. The egg was cooked perfectly. With a crispy outline and egg yolk running everywhere, this dish was very rich. Each fork full had fries drenched in a mix of chorizo grease and egg yolk. The pork chorizo had a nice mellow flavor with a little kick of spice -- terrific. with all this grease and pork, I began to think this is a perfect hang over cure in Las Vegas.. . Looking for a carb load other than potatoes, we ordered the creamy risotto. This was a nice risotto, though the rice was a little too undercooked. Maybe 30 seconds longer on the fire would have made it perfect. Better to be a tad undercooked that overcooked, I guess. Other than the texture, this was delicious. The wild mushrooms gave it a nice grounded flavor. The shaving of aged manchego cheese worked perfectly with the mushrooms. Manchego, my new favorite cheese, has a resemblance and taste profile of truffles. The rich earthy flavor worked perfectly with the rice. I just wished there was more of it.. . Finally, we ordered the beef and cheese. Looking for more meat in our tapas, we figured this would be a perfect candidate. The prime tenderloin cooked to a perfect medium rare was soft as butter. Manchego cheese was on top and the dish was amazing. Topped with the honey and pecans, the sweetness kind of killed my savory steak experience. My mind was confused -- was this a steak or was it dessert? Though it didn't taste all that bad, the off putting sweetness of the honey was surprising. All in all, the meat was soft and buttery, and I preferred this over the flat iron.. . Julian Serrano was an amazing experience. Tapas is gaining popularity -- it lets you try so many things! Be careful though, you can easily get carried away and run up the bill. Celebrity chef Julian Serrano knows what he is doing. When you are talking about chefs in California, he is the best around, and possibly in the nation. It was great to try his food in such a casual atmosphere. When you are in Vegas, you want to eat nice and splurge. At Julian Serrano, you can feel like you are splurging on a nice meal, but not pay over the top prices. The atmosphere is warm and elegant as is the food. Tapas is on the strip, and it's at Julian Serrano.
Decent tapas, excellent service, and a fun energetic atmosphere. Came here for my sister-in-laws birthday celebration, and everyone had a good time. Unfortunately I cant really give them a great rating because the food was just average to good at best. We ordered a large variety of tapas and none of them really stood out. The white sangria wasn't really that good, a lot of ice, not much fruit, and not very strong. I still had fun, but it had a lot more to do with the company that I was with rather than the restaurant we were at.
Loved this restaurant - definitely a fantastic option for lunch or dinner in Vegas. Moderately priced, the tapas is delicious - I would recommend 3-4 dishes per person, for sharing with others. The white anchovies and mixed seafood ceviche  were my personal favourites! Also try the cocktails - again, beautiful, plus they sure do pack a punch! Recommend making a reservation.
Very good experience here! The ambiance is great, the food is Tapas style and yummy, and the service is good as well! The drinks in specific are PHENOMENAL!
