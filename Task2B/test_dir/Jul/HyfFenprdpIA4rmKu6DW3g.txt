AMAZING!!!. . The bf and I came here on a Sunday night at 12am. We had to wait about an hour and half. TOTALLY WORTH IT!!. . Ordered:. - Half a dozen oysters: Big and juicy. . - White clam chowder: possibly one of the best clam chowders I've had. Had chunks of clams with every spoonful.. - Combo Pan Roast (level 7): pretty spicy for 7. Came with a scoop of rice. I noticed some people requesting pasta instead of rice. It's a heavy and hearty dish but has really good flavor. Every time I dipped my spoon in crab, lobster, or shrimp was in my spoon. They don't skimp on the seafood here. - Bouillabaisse - The very light version of the pan roast. Pan roast it creamy, bouillabaisse is not creamy but has the same deliciousness as pan roast. Comes with rice. It's like a seafood soup almost.. . The servers and the chef are very nice and helpful. Since it was our first time the server helped us order. . . This place is found inside the Palace Station casino. Parking isn't bad, but we took a cab there.. . . Will definitely be coming back here everytime we're in town.
Food is pretty delicious, very flavorful and steaming hot fresh off the pot, but the wait was pretty ridiculous so be prepared. We got here at 2pm with about 15 people in front of us. Took about 1 hour and 15 mins to get seated, then another 45 mins til we finally got our food. The turn around time at the bar was way too slow. 1 chef, 1 waitress, and 2 dish washers in the back. For as busy and delicious as this place is, they should def hire another waitress. Worth it to try the food though. Go in small groups, 2-3 people so you get seated faster.
The pan roast is amazing! So much shrimp and lobster chunks! Props to the chef (EZ). . We didn't get a $5 charge for splitting the bowl, but we did get a $2.99 charge for another bowl of rice. . . We were debating between a dozen oysters, a dozen clams and a shrimp cocktail or just trying all three for only $20.. We ended up ordering seafood sampler which had 3 raw oysters, 3 raw clams, and 3 raw shrimps. . I asked the guy in blue (steve) How do you pick your oysters to tell which ones were the freshest? . He replied, "Oh I just pick by which ones I think are the easiest to open.. I don't really know how they are on the inside.. ". I got a bad feeling about that once he finished his sentence, but the oysters looked pretty clean and unmurky, so I accepted that advice. We got our plate and then we proceeded to start. The shrimps were very delicious, very sweet and fresh. Then came the oyster.. The first one I ate was so fishy, I thought I was gonna get food poisoning after swallowing it. I couldn't spit it out because the guy was staring at me and sort of smiling like 'I know how to pick fresh ones right?' x_X . . All three of the oysters were extremely fishy, even though they were quite clean looking.... I recommend not getting it haha. The clams were very sweet and fresh however so that was a plus.
Love this place. Last time I came I sprinted to cut in front of anybody else. Have had the pan roast, bouillabaisse, gumbo and etouffee. My fav is still the pan roast. All the chefs have a different range in their spiciness levels and Bob def makes it spicy! Can't go above a level 6 with him! Just a note, this is NOT a full scale restaurant. It's more like a bar with about 16 bar seats. So if you have even 5 people ahead of you, the wait can still be pretty ridiculous. Palace Station needs to just change it's name to Oyster Bar and expand the sitting area! . . Btw, I never finish the pan roast and I would NEVER recommend sharing it with anybody because my favorite thing to do is reheating that bad boy later on that day. The spices and flavors deepen so it tastes that much better. Plus you'll regret sharing it when you go home and you're craving it. Last time I was there some guy was taking 7 to go....to check in on an airplane. Now that's love.
I've always wanted to try this place but never had the chance to until this past weekend! My friends who frequent this place recommended that we come around 10-11am to avoid long lines. We got there and there were only 3 people in front of us so we waited about 10 minutes. I got the combo pan roast and my boyfriend got the jambalaya. Looooved it! Super hot and creamy deliciousness! Service was very good, the chef and waitress were very friendly so that's a huge plus. The overall experience was wonderful.
Came here on a Sunday Night not knowing what to expect. My boyfriend was raving about this place and wanted to take me here for dinner. Beware that the restaurant can only seat 16 people and it might take you a while before you get seated. We ended up waiting about 2 hours to get seated at the bar and almost another hour for the food to be prepared/cooked. So if you plan on coming here, be prepared to endure a long wait or come at an odd hour to avoid a long line!. . We ordered the Raw Oysters, Combo Pan Roast with Lobster, Crab, & Shrimp, and the Seafood Gumbo. The Raw Oysters were delicious and tasted really fresh. I would say they're pretty comparable to the oysters in Seattle. It tasted fabulous with the fresh lemon juice & marina sauce. . . The Pan Roast was also DELICIOUS and the best I have yet. I liked that the broth was really creamy but didn't have an overpowering taste of seafood. The sauce was so addicting and I just couldn't get enough. Good thing the portions here are huge! They were also really generous with their seafood portions and the lobster was cooked beautifully!. . As for the Gumbo, I will have to pass next time. The gumbo was just way too salty and I ended up getting tired of it after a few bites. I didn't bother getting my order to go because I knew I wasn't going to be able to enjoy it later. . . Overall the food was good but I wouldn't say it's worth waiting 2-3 hours in line for. I would recommend trying out this place if you're able to go at an odd time. If you're trying to go during peak time then good luck and be sure to wear some comfy shoes!
What the oyster!. . The name of this place is actually misleading because personally I did not enjoy the raw oysters much and did not see that many people ordering it, but the crazy good food here MORE than made up for the lackluster oysters!. . I've had pan roast before but was honestly was never a fan. When my Las Vegas date suggested this place, I kind of made a scrunchy face but said yes and boy am I glad I did!  . . Two words can sum up this review:  PAN ROAST. . . Get the pan roast. I got a level 6 spicy which was perfect.  It was creamy, flavorful and packed full of rich seafood ingredients. It was so heavy and delicious that I had to sleep sitting up for the remainder of the night. We also tried half dozen raw oysters which were not horrible but not great, so I suggest just skipping it, and also the cioppino which wasn't memorable either. The seafood in the cioppino was definitely fresh but overall, it was bit heavy on the tomato base for my liking.   One thing I liked was that they cooked the food right in front of you so you could see all of the hard work, sweat, love, and seafood that goes into your food. . . Beware of the wait though.  We took a cab to Palace Station around 11:30pm and waited for about two hours to be seated. It's a small place, bar seating in the middle of the casino and accommodates only 18 lucky folks at a time... which means you have to put in your time and wait. By the time we finished, it was 3am and I was delirious but deliriously stuffed with pan roast. . . Conclusion:  Totally worth it.
I ate here with my husband on a super hot night, so maybe I just did not find soupy hot red broth exciting.  The Chef was amazing and offered us a cool new view on how to prepare soup.  Otherwise, there was nothing exciting about our dinner.  It was a hot bowl of tomato soup with seafood and quite underseasoned if you ask me.  . . Sorry Yelp but I just did not get this place nor the high reviews. . . Maybe I missed something.
Best soup in town. Hands down.  It is worth waiting even 3 hours for. . . If you don't want to wait, go in the morning on the week days between 9 and 11 am. That will ensure you get right in. . . If it's your first time start with the pan roast since it's the house classic.
What can I say.  This place will leave you wanting more and thinking of when will be the next time you will come back to this place.  Everything looks great and you better believe it, taste great. It's a must try if you're in Vegas the unfortunate part is that it only seats 16 so the wait might be long but sooooooo worth it.
I tried the Oyster Bar at the Palace station on a recommendation from a friend.  the lines were always long throughout the day so I decided to try it when I woke up in the morning.  I order a combo pan roast and a half dozen on oysters. Everything was so fresh.  I watched the chef make my meal from scratch while I was eating my oyters. The taste and service of this place was amazing. This might be the best meal I had in vegas so far. Warning if you dont like spicy stuff ask the chef to keep it at a 2 or 3 on a scale of 1 to 10. Anything ove 5 is to much.
Can I just say this place was awful and please nobody go when Im in Vegas so I can skip the long agonizing line? I waited nearly two hours my first time and I was back within 48 hrs for more. The soup here is the bomb dot com!!! Hands down the best gumbo Ive ever tasted and in truth, Im not even a gumbo chick. The pan roast was amazing and I ate till my stomach hurt (ahhh...hurt so good). It sucks that I am in Texas and cant enjoy the food any hour of the day. Cant wait to go back to Vegas; not for the gambling, not for the shopping, not for the shows, but for a bowl of delicious soupy goodness.
Don't know why this place got such good reviews, 4 1/2 stars! I was staying at Palace Station, so naturally I wanted to try this place because of all the good reviews. I got the combo pan roast like everyone suggested on yelp and there was nothing good to say about it except for the 3 pieces of lobster that was in there and the few shrimp. You could barely see any crab meat in there. The rice that came with it was soggy and clumpy and not enough when comparing the pan roast and rice ratio. . . Pros: . -It was just a short walk away since I was staying at the hotel.. -the waitress and cook were nice . . Cons: based on the combo pan roast that I got. . -rice, way too soggy and clumpy, and not enough for the pan roast.. -the combo pan roast was overpriced for what you get. Only 3 pieces of lobster, just a few shrimp, and hardly any crab meat.. -long line, long wait (not at all worth it). Save your money for something better or spend a little more for a nice buffet.
Summary: My SO and I like to dine at Ritter's Steam Kettle in Costa Mesa, California (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ritters-steam-kettle-cooking-santa-ana) and when we found out Oyster Bar was own by the same company we have to give it a try. The wait was long (1 hour 17 minute to be exact) we were behind 5 couples but it was worth it.. . Food: We had Cold Seafood Combination, New England Clam Chowder, and Combo Pan Roast. It was exquisite, the food tasted phenomenal. I don't know was it because of the long wait or not but at that moment I think it taste better than Ritter's. . . Service: The Chef was awesome, just watching him prep the pan roast and constantly making sure his patron were satisfied. Nick, the server/host was a tad unprofessional. So the Chef happen to place our dish at the wrong patron, no need to raise your voice at him. The Chef job is to prep and cook not serve. He was doing you a favor, helping you out and when he place my order to the people beside me, you shouldn't have snap at him. It still amaze me how the Chef just stay mellow and apologize to you. Not to mention when you were behind, he even step outside the counter to bust the table and seat the next group. Show some appreciation man. . . Overall: I always make it a habit to go to Egg & I (http://www.yelp.com/biz/egg-and-i-las-vegas) for breakfast  every time I visit Vegas and now Oyster Bar is a must also. I'm so glad Oyster Bar isn't located on the strip. Imagine if it was, I'm probably looking at half a day wait time. Then again, it is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So that's not bad.
OMG stop what you're doing and try this place out.....now!!!  Well actually, maybe not, there's a huge line and you'll most likely be waiting for two hours.  . . It's literally a bar, and they only seat 18, so be prepared to do your due diligence and stand in line.  Or you can have an awesome friend stand in line for the group while you grab a drink, play some slots or blackjack until you're seated.  TRUST ME, it's worth the wait!!!  And that's coming from someone who NEVER waits in line for food.  . . You really don't come here for the oysters, you come here for the combo pan roast.  Don't get me wrong, the dozen oysters we ordered were fresh and on point (from Louisiana I think...), but there's plenty of other places to get fresh oysters.  I wasn't too crazy about the mussels but it was worth a try.. . The chef cooks directly in front of where you're seated, so you get a bird's eye view of the action.  I noticed many of the guests are regulars, so they must know how amazing the food is here.. . The combo pan roast...bomb diggity!  I only got it level 6 spiciness (probably could have gone with a level 8), but WOW, I was blown away!!  Creamy, spicy, tons of flavor mixed with shrimp, crab, and lobster!  The portions are huge, and I promise you will be extremely satisfied afterwards.. . It's a shame they have such a small seating area and they don't take orders to go; if you are ordering to go, you have to stand in line anyways, so I guess it makes sense.  But goodness, expand this place would ya!!. . Whenever I'm in Vegas again, this will definitely be on my top places to visit.  Good thing they're open 24/7!
I have recently planned a road trip to Vegas with my party crew and we changed our departure time from Friday morning to Thursday night just so that we could drive straight to the Oyster Bar at Palace Station to avoid the long line and also to have a pan roast for our first Vegas meal before the calm before the storm becomes uncalm. Yes, it's that good. Do whatever you want in your life, just make sure that if you come here, you order a pan roast and nothing else. Well, you could try other things because variety is the spice of life and all that, but just make sure a pan roast is part of your order. I prefer the combo pan roast.
Let me start by saying this place actually deserves 5 stars, but one major flaw made me knock it down one.. . That flaw: There are 18 seats. Which translates to a minimum wait time of 1 hour... we waited 2 and a half.. . YES, 2 and a half hours standing in line in the middle of a casino to eat at this tiny little bar that serves amazing food. I rarely ever find myself in line for that long for any other reason. I wouldn't even wait that long to get a blowjob from Justin Bieber. That's just a ridiculously long time, and yet... I was still blown away.. . The food is Cajun themed and serves a variety of Creole style food. I ordered the Jambalaya(+++), others in my party ordered the Seafood Bake(++), Gumbo, and Cioppino (fish stew+++). Aside from the Gumbo, which was a tad salty, the food was the best damn Creole food I've ever had.. . The food is cooked in individual pans that are cooked right in front of you by a single chef. This dude runs around like a maniac, doing all the prepping, seasoning, oyster-shucking, clam-steaming, and rice-cooking. He is a machine and yet still so friendly. He kept working at a furious pace, but would still be able to converse with the seated individuals. He would be the an amazing bartender if he could mix drinks like the way he cooks.. . All the ingredients are fresh, and the oysters are individually wrapped to ensure quality every time. After deciding upon a spiciness level (1-10) you get to watch the master work. Side note: I ordered a 4, and am a big fan of spicy food. I figured if it wasn't hot enough, I'll just add more hot-sauce. It was pretty darn perfect. A nice kick, but not too over-powering. My fellow diners ordered a 5 and 6, and the 6 was starting to get pretty intense.. . The portions are huge, I finished only 2/3 of my Jambalaya and was shocked 'cause I have been left to starve and wince in hunger for 2 hours prior. The presentation is simple, but due to the quality and quantity of the food, it looked absolutely delicious.. . Overall, I would say this is definitely an AMAZING hidden secret in Vegas. But the Palace Station is off-strip and a little annoying to take a cab just for this meal. But if you ever find yourself in the area and are down for some GREAT seafood, this should definitely be an option... just be prepared to wait an ungodly amount of time.
Waited around 1 hour 15 mins for 3 people.  The worst part about the weight in line is smelling the food being cooked!!! Hints of garlic and spices fill the air!!! What a tease.  . . I loved the food!!! Got combo pan roast, oysters and a bottle of moscato. DELICIOUS! !! Food changed my life. The spices,  seafood and rice was all pefect and fresh. . . If it wasn't for that line id be there once a week. . . I suggest going with another person and take turns waiting in line. Switch off to wait in line and gamble. .. hehe. . . If you've never tried oyster bar, its a must. Be prepared to wait. Be patient. I think if you go there mentally prepared to weight, its really not bad. . . Yum yum yum!!!
The wait is long. Be prepared. Wait in line while the other plays some cards. Best gumbo and best oysters ever! . . The chef single handedly makes all the meals. He's awesome! The food is amazing.
before you read on, BE PREPARED TO WAIT 1-2 hours to be seated!. 18 seats around a bar, 1 server, 1 cook, 1 bus boy. No Kids allowed. Open 24 hours. They tell me it's busy all day long except 7-730AM :). . Our first time at oyster bar. - 90 minute wait for 2 of us. - Amazing food - LOVE the pan roast and clam chowder. Gumbo was good but salty.  We got spice level of 5 /10 and was "mild" for my taste.. - Great service. - Cooked in front of you. . We will be back if we have the time to wait that long again!
Yes the wait is pretty outrageous but so well worth it at the end. Waited about an hour to be seated but during the wait decided to grab a few drinks with the bf to "kill" time. I ordered the combo pan roast and the bf and brother both had the lobster pan roast. Food  came out AMAZING! The taste of each bite had me keep going and going. Brother and bf were both surprised of how much I ate since I normally don't eat so much. I couldn't stop myself...which I paid the the price for later lol! Don't let the wait time discourage you! well worth every minute. I still don't understand why they don't increase staff? One cook and one hostess/busser/server?? Hmmm doesn't quite add up with the number of customers coming in.
if you're reading this while standing in a ridiculously long line... suck it up because it's worth it! . . you'll forget you even waited that long once you've inhaled the combo pan roast, which you finished eating in less than 15 minutes.
Go at off peak hours or else be prepared to wait...and wait...and sometimes give up waiting and go somewhere else. But if you're lucky enough to snag one of the 15 seats at the counter, you won't be disappointed. . . Pan roast is the most popular item, it's rich and creamy base of either seafood or sausage or a combo of all. I would recommend just seafood or add sausage, the have the Palace Pan Roast which comes with chicken but that adds nothing to the dish. They do give you very large meaty shrimps if you order the ones that comes with it. The side of rice they give you is the perfect vessal to soak up all the yummy goodness. . . The oystersare reasonably priced, very meaty. The horseradish sauce has a nice kick.. . Chowders are also very good, tons of seafood and clams.. . I like the ciopino too, again tons of seafood and large juicy shrimp.. . This is 4 not 5 stars because depending on whose cooking, sometimes the dishes aren't as good. My last visit here I think they were switching shifts and the new guy started our 5 dishes, then ran around looking for something, left our food to cook/burn on the cookers and left and the other guy had to quickly finish it off. They tasted OK but I know it could have been better if our chef had cooked our food correctly. And for the ladies, make sure you bring a jacket because the location is right under an air vent and it's always freezing at the bar.
Food was good, a little heavy handed on the cream aspect of the soups as well as the salt levels. Wait was long, but worth it.
We came here around 1:30am and the wait was still a little over an hour, BUTT it was worth the wait!!! The oysters were bomb and we got the Palace Pan Roast. It has seafood and sausage in it. We asked for it to be spicy (8 out 10 spicy). It was so delicious!!! If anyone's been to Ritter's Pan Roast, this place is WAY BETTER!!! It's a MUST TRY if you are willing to wait :) . . If the wait wasn't so long, I'd give them a 5 star!! But the wait kind of kills you haha.
Wentat 2pm on a Tu so there was no line,  they said i was lucky.. The oysters were of adequate size, however tasteless.  Somehow they seemed off.. Would have expected much better quality of oysters at an oyster bar.. Now to their main dish.  Had their Combo Pan Roast.  It was good but not exceptional as many says in their reviews.  . Would have given the Pan Roast a 4 and the oysters brought the restaurant down to a 3.. Lucky there was no line, i would not have been happy if i waited in line for this meal.
Walked inside Palace Station and did not expect to find a restaurant that merely consists of a bar situated right outside the casino floor.  Being such small establishment with seating less than 20 people at a time, I can definitely see why everyone whines about the long wait.  Fortunately, we opted for a nontraditional breakfast which turned out to be a great idea as the place was completely empty around 7am.  They do offer a daily Moonlight Special from 1am to 9am with $2.00 16oz Bud Light drafts, $5.00 wines and $8.99 1/2 dozen oysters so I wouldn't be surprise if there happened to be a line that early in the morning.  One thing I don't understand is why not expand into a bigger location considering how big their clientele is.  At least this way, they can focus on customer service and preserve such exceptional food quality.. . Speaking of food, everything we had was quite tasty!!  I ended up ordering the etouffee while she had the palace pan roast.  Obviously, seafood isn't fresh off the boat that morning but at least they actually cook it in front of their guests so you know what they serve hasn't been simmering in their kitchen for days.  My dish had great Cajun flavors synonymous with a typical etouffee from NoLa.  I like how the seafood was perfectly cooked and not rubbery at all.  They also didn't skimp out on ingredients, especially lobsters, so paying $22 for a bowl of soup was totally worth it!!. . Overall, Oyster Bar is a must for visitors and locals alike.  Check this place out during off peak hours (early mornings/late nights) to avoid waiting for a long time just to get seated!!  Since they're open 24/7 this would actually be a great ending to a long night of debauchery especially with the Happy Hour being so late.
My friends and I went to Vegas last month and had SUCH A GOOD TIME! We came and ate here and loved it. Their food is soooooooo delicious. I'll be honest, a bit pricey but I'm assuming its because it's Vegas? Not sure but it was worth it though.
Finally got to try this place!! The oyster bar is inside Palace Station hotel and literally only seats about 16 people at a time. We came during the odd hours of the night (3am) after we left the club and was surprised to find people still waiting in line. Can't imagine how long the wait would be during the day or even dinner time but we ended up waiting at least an hour still before being seated. . . So...was the wait really worth it?? You betcha!!! If you can stand long lines, you seriously won't be disappointed!. . Must order items:. . - Clam Chowder : soooo yummy and creamy and filled with lots of clams! . . - Palace Pan Roast: OMG...my mouth waters just thinking about it. I got a level 5 spice and it was perfect! They fill it up with tons of seafood and sausage. The flavoring of the soup broth is freaken amazing!!! . . - Jambalaya: the spicier the better!! BestI ever had!! . . The portions here are HUGE so get a variety and share so you can try more things! Takes a bit of time to actually get your food since there's only 2 chefs doing everything but you can tell they use all fresh ingredients and everything is made to order. Really enjoyed the Cajun/creole style food here!! Can't wait to come back!
I ordered the combo pan roast with a spicy rating of 9 and my wife ordered the bouillabaise, the taste just explodes.in you're mouth, so full of flavor. We waited about an hour to be seated but it was worth the wait...every single time I come to las Vegas from now on, I'll make sure to come to the oyster bar at the palace station...wow!!!
This is my favorite place to eat in Vegas! I would drive the 4 hours and wait the 2 hours for this. It is worth it! . - Combo pan roast - hands down the best thing here. So much seafood, so much flavor. It's like an explosion in your mouth with every bite. Gosh it's good. . - Jambalaya - delish as well, a little dry for my taste. I like the pan roast better b/c it's more liquidy. - Gumbo - was kind of bitter...or maybe I was hungover? haha But I took home half of it and ate it later and I dont know if it was b/c the rice was all soaked in with the liquid or what but it tasted amazing!! Weird....I know. - Alaska clam chowder - probably is my 2nd favorite dish here. It's soooo good.
