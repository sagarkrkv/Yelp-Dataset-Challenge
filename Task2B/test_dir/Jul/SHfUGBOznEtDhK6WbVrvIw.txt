Amazing! Tender and great flavor. On par with brisket from central Texas. Went in on a Monday afternoon, between lunch and dinner. Only waited for a minute or two outside.  Coleslaw was verygood, flavor of sweet dill pickles. Buy a shirt!  Never did and regretted it.
I found this place hearing it's the best place to get smoked meat in montreal. and it IS!! . Came around 8pm on a monday and there was a very long line up, so we came back the next day on Canada's day around 12 and there was no line up- amazing! Inside is packed with people, and it smells great. Looks like a diner, the walls are filled with newspapers and articles about their great reputation. The blue jays have even signed for them.. . Had the classic medium smoked meat burger. Best meat sandwich I ever had in my life. Thick meat smothered in mustard on rye bread, the meat is to dye for. There's a lot of it though, but the best part is the crust. The meat is extremely flavourful, juicy, and tender. You see why they're in business for so long. Waiter recommended medium, but I think next time I would order lean instead, there was a lot of fat in the medium one. It's weird because my friend also got medium but was leaner than my cut.. . They are quick to serve and they want you out of there because they gave us the bill when I wasn't done eating. Great guys though, and I would come back again if I have the chance!
I'm not a big fan of smoked meat, but everyone who has come here with me has LOVED the smoked meat sandwiches. IF you don't want to wait in line and don't mind taking to go - just walk go their takeout area (store on the left).. . Recommendation: 110%.
Before, I went to Montreal, my co-worker asked me if I was planning on staying on my "silly diet" while I was on vacation, and he sternly informed me that, if I did, I would be missing out on the best pastrami sandwich I had ever tasted.  The funny thing is, that even though he never got around to giving me the name of the place before I left, I somehow knew immediately when I randomly happened upon it that this was probably the place he was talking about.  It was confirmed when I bit into the delicious, tender smoked meat.  I sent him a one word email that night:  "Schwartz's?". . "Yes!!" He replied, "you found it!!"
Dude, so good!. . Schwartz's alone is worth the trip to Montreal! You can get lean, meaty, or fatty smoked meat. Only mustard, meat, and bread... fries too if you want them.. . You won't find a better place for smoked meat sandwiches.. . This is a place that does one thing right.
Maybe I'm just not a fan of smoked meat but I didn't really find Schwartz that amazing and compared to the Main Deli across the street, Schwartz feels way too cramped for my liking.. . Schwartz is usually packed.  I had to come here three times before I was actually willing to line up since the other two times had insanely long queues!  We were packed really tightly into a small table with very uncomfortable seating, right by the kitchen.  It honestly wasn't that great of an experience and I enjoyed the coleslaw at Main Deli more.. . Anyways, I guess Schwartz's smoked meat itself may be a bit tastier than what you can get at Main Deli but I honestly don't find smoked meat that amazing. For me, the half hour line up wasn't too worth it but I'm sure there are tons of people who love smoked meat!  The prices are very reasonable too (compared to a quick meal in Vancouver I guess)
Schwartz's is the gold standard for being the best at what you do.  They haven't changed a thing in decades, because it's perfect.. . While they have a menu, you just go for the smoked meat.  I like to get the platter of medium (fattiness that is), a stack of rye slices, some mustard, and just devour one sandwich after the next.  Along the way, have some fries with vinegar and pickles, and then wash it down with a black cherry soda.. . You may have to wait a little while in line and eat with other people at your table, but it's all part of sharing the experience.
Great old deli place that's got simple tables and seats and a tiny menu. But they make a damn good smoked meat sandwich. Flavorful and warm the meat is way better than what you get in New York delis like Katz. You also don't feel pressure and the staff who has been there for a while know they have a good product so they don't sweat the small stuff. Highly recommended.
DIRTY CUTLERIES! RUDE WAITER telling customers to remove their bags from a seat so prospective other customers who have not showed up yet can sit. On our table, multiple knives were still EXTREMELY DIRTY with meat stains all over them, and yet those knives were stacked up as if they were cleaned and ready to use for customers. . The waiter repeatedly told us to cramp our 3 seats together and remove our bags from the 4th seat so other non-existent customers can sit and share our table. I have never met a waiter so rude!. . These 2 things were the deal breakers for my family and me. We were already seated and ready to order our lunch, but we decided to leave Schwartz and take our business elsewhere.. . NEVER AGAIN I WILL SET FOOT IN THIS F*&KING PLACE!
Came here for smoked meat on my trip to Montreal. Full confession, Schwartz has been tradition among my family as long as I can remember so there may be a bit of bias here. As far as I can tell it's the best smoked meat i have had and the quality is always high. . . I also usually go to the take out window. Usuallythe family is taking a big order back to Ottawa and we have to grab sandwiches for the road. It cuts down on the legendary line and hilariously brisk service. . . This time my girlfriend and I grabbed sandwiches along with two pickles and some potato salad and ate it in the shadow of Mount Royal. Perfect day.
Desafortunadamente le crei al taxista que me juro y  perjurio que este lugar era lo mejor lamento mucho el haber malgastado mi dinero es pobre sandwich no vale el mal trato del personal que me atendio el coleslaw ni vale nada sin duda que hazte fama y echate a dormir una estrella es mucho para este lugar deberian los propietarios viajar a nueva Orlando y comerse una mufalletta. y a lo mejor aprenden algo
Schwartz's smoked meat eh?  Coming from NYC, the capital of deli's, I think I would have very high standards.  So, whatdya got?  You have  two options here, go the sit down route and wait in that horrendous line or do the take out route and be in and out in 15 minutes.  Since we didn't want to waste our limited time in Montreal standing in line, we did option two.  Food here is pretty cheap you can get one of their sandwiches for $8.00 CAD (IIRC) and fries for another $2.00 or so.  This pricing of course is infinitely cheaper than what Carnegie Deli or Katz's Delicatessen will charge you.  Hell you can get TWO sandwiches at Schwartz's for the NYC equivalent.  . . However, the big difference is in the size.  Katz's sandwich is huge, piled high with so much meat you could make two sandwiches out of it.  So I guess on price, it's about even.  The smoke meat at Schwartz's has a rich and deep flavor but what I disliked was how dry it actually was.  Because it was so dry, the juicy goodness of Katz's wins hands down.  I never quite understand why these Jewish delis use crappy rye bread to hold down such a massive amount of meat, they always tend to fall apart quite quickly and make a mess.  Either way, Schwartz's was a good stop to try Montreal Smoked Meat, but it just can't beat what we have in Manhattan.
Schwartz. was ok. Would not go out the way for their sandwiches. Compare to NY'S FAMOUS Katz's Schwart's is not as tasty and juicy. also they charge extra for the pickles!
This is the perfect hole in the wall experience i wanted. The sandwhich was cheap, quick, simple yet delicious. If you want to try the local favorite deli, you have to try this place. They also have a dining area where you can sit down and order but we didn't want to wait in line. Judging by the number of people there, they are doing something right
Puede que el de Schwartz's no sea el mejor sandwich de Montreal, pero es sin duda el mas famoso. Asi lo demuestran los cientos de recortes de periodico colgados de sus paredes y la cola interminable que hay que hacer antes de sentarse a la mesa. Y es que esta pequena charcuteria hebrea, que lleva abierta desde 1928, es mas recomendable como atraccion turistica que como restaurante. . . Puestos a vivir la experiencia en su maximo apogeo, sugiero pedir un sandwich de carne ahumada acompanado de patatas fritas, un pepinillo, ensalada de col y bebida gaseosa de cereza. Eso si, puede que salgas rodando por la puerta... pero un dia es un dia!. . *Nota para los impacientes que hartos de esperar la cola de Schwartz's se plantean comer en The Main, la competencia al otro lado de la calle: No lo hagas, no es lo mismo. Es preferible que pidas un sandwich para llevar y lo comas en el parque Jean Mance.
Schwartz's came recommended by a tour-guide in Montreal as a one of a kind Montreal lunch/dinner that we shouldn't miss. Did I mention he was a brewery tour guide? Because being about 5 beers deep makes smoked meat taste amazing. Maybe that skews my review a bit, so you can take it or leave it. . . Pickles are one of my favorite foods, and I loved every second of the giant pickle I ordered. Paired with a coke and a side of fries, this was a pretty good lunch. . . I'm not one to complain about lines. If a place is delicious enough, I will wait up to an hour. I was in line for about 20 minutes, and I have to say if I came here again and I saw that line, I would probably decide not to go in. Not because it was bad, but just because I could probably find something else to suit my drunk cravings. . . It was very crowded but the selection was minimal, so I made a quick decision that I was happy with. The meat was drier than I was expecting, but still very tasty. Add dat mustard and you'll be good.. . The atmosphere was deli-ish. I don't know how else to describe that. Be prepared to sit at a table with people you don't know. The people who work there are kind of scary, in that fun, angry-city-deli-man way. As our tour guide told us, it's all part of the experience. Should you make this part of your Montreal experience? Sure! Is it a must? Nah.
This place was highly recommended by just about everyone, and for good reason!. . There was a bit of a line up but it was worth it as the smoked meat sandwich was quite delicious. The rye bread couldn't quite hold the large stack of meat that was stuffed in between the two slices, but the messiness is part of the experience.. . The restaurant has a very deli feel to it, as that's exactly what it is. It's not the type of food you sit down to eat, it's more of a wait in line, grab a sandwich and walk around the street type of deal. . . Overall the meat was delicious and worth the hype. It would be much better if there were more toppings offered to make it more complete.
My husband, who is a Cleveland native and fan of that city's wonderful Romanian deli, Corky and Lenny's, had high hopes for Schwartz's.  Though there was a line when we arrived, it moved quickly, and we shared a table with two other customers with no appreciable wait.  Our waiter was efficient and good-natured--no small feat given the hordes of people moving through there at all hours.. . We got smoked meat sandwiches (medium-fat, following advice from just about everyone) with a pickle, cole slaw and fries.  The pickle was great; the coleslaw was sweet and sour and vinegary, in a style I like and associate with Eastern European countries like Hungary and the Czech Republic.  The rye bread on the sandwiches was fresh and tasty with just enough caraway. I appreciated the portion size--generous but not crazy a la Carnegie Deli. So far, so good.  Not so good? The fries, which were greasy and not remotely crispy.. . As for the meat, well, Zabar's in NYC wins for me (their spicing is a little more complex and the meat is moister), and my husband maintains his loyalty to his favorite Cleveland smoked meat.  It's worth mentioning that what constitutes "medium-fat" is really the luck of the knife and which end of the meat your portion happens to come from.  My husband's sandwich had several pieces that were entirely fat, which felt a little excessive to both of us.  My sandwich was leaner, and in our opinion, tastier as a result. On the other hand, I do agree with others that ordering the sandwich "lean" would be a mistake--the meat is on the dry side already, and without a little fat along for the ride would lose much of its flavor. . . In short, Schwartz's for us was good but not great--definitely not up to the considerable hype.  If you've never encountered deli food before, it would be a fun experience, but for us, it just didn't hold up to the excellent deli sandwiches we've had elsewhere.
This is the perfect example of hype outweighing reality. The food is average and the service is below par. Our waiter forcefully suggested a meal option which he said was a great deal and also decided to add some things we didn't order. Tip tell them exactly what you want and dont let them upsell. This great deal was exactly the same price as on the menu if ordered separately. Only having a few nights in montreal i was very disappointed i wasted one of my meals at schwartz's.
Smoked meat piled high. on a thin slice of rye. What more could you want?. And why?. . Almost $8 for a tasty sandwich, not bad. About half as much as those famous delis in NYC. Possibly a tad drier than those, but that's what mustard is for! Somehow, it doesn't feel as sinful either.
amazing atmosphere, yummy smoked meat, great 1/2 sour pickle and no mayo coleslaw.  It felt like a locals spot, but booming. Definitely old school.  Cash Only with an ATM in the back.
Split 1 full fat and 1 medium sandwich with a friend. Get a plate of fries, cherry coke, cole slaw and a pickle. Schwartz's is an experience one must take part of at least once in their life... Or as many times as possible.
The line for lunch was relatively long but it was worth the wait. This small deli serves up tasty smoked meat sandwiches. . . I really enjoyed the black cherry cola too. Definitely worth another visit the next time I am in Montreal.
First of all, I like Katz deli in NYC than this place. (Am from NYC) but the pastrami sandwich was not bad here. but service here was horrible. Bald, belly out and glass wearing guy was serving utensil and place for my table. I was with ma family. This place was packed as usual as other tourist places in Quebec.. . I didn't expect to get Michelin 3 star restaurant service. However, this guy must know how to serve customers. I understand how busy he was. but HE SHOULD NOT THROW KNIFE ON THE TABLE!! HOW DARE DID HE!!. . My bro got somewhat pissed and asked him gently to do nicer. and THE GUY SAID HE GOT A NEW BOSS!! What kind of service was that?? He needs to go back to elementary school to learn very basic stuffs to be a human.. . By the way, food was not bad. just service was horrible..
