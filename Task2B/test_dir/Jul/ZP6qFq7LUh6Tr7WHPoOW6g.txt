I had some time to kill before a show at the Smith Center, so I found eat. on yelp for good brunch!  Eat. is in downtown Vegas.  Since it was my first time, the area really didn't look as good as the strip. Eat. is on the corner of 7th and Carson.  . . I found street parking easily on 7th ($1 / hour, max 2 hours).  There are pay stations everywhere conveniently.  I had a party of 6, so I had to waitto be seated until entire party was present.  I was on a time crunch though, so when the rest of the party was still parking, the manager let me be seated first.  We were able to get a table right away and put in our orders before it got too late.  On a Saturday afternoon, I thought it was still busy.  Some parties had a short 10-15 minute wait.  This restaurant reminded me of Cheeky's in Palm Springs - very good brunch place with outdoor seating.. . Food was really good.  As I was perusing the menu, I wanted to order everything!  I couldn't decide what to get because they all sounded really good.  My shrimp and grits had plenty of shrimp ($13).  I did not feel ripped off, and there were 2 big pieces of bacon in it!  The portion was enough to share with 2 people.  The cinnamon biscuit with strawberry compote was perfect ($8). The 4 biscuits were not dry at all, and the compote was not too sweet.  They looked so cute - disc-shaped.  My friends who had Huevos Montulenos $12, Chicken Fried Steak $14, and the eggs benedict $13 thought their dishes turned out really well, too.  Everything pretty much had huge serving sizes.  I love that!  Next time I'll probably try the arugula salad or the pancakes..mm... . I really like the service here.  Everyone is so friendly and NOT stuck up, which is something I'm used to with a popular hipster cafe/restaurant.  The hostess was  accommodating, even though she had to get a manager to authorize seating us early..She was still nice about it.  Our server Marissa was nice and helped us quickly since we were in a rush.. . I will definitely be back next time!
I missed breakfast!  (A little too much craft beer at Public House the night prior). We didn't get here until 12:30. . My wife and I split the Truffle Egg Sandwich!   Awesome stuff - it came on a super soft ciabatta bun with fluffy scrambled eggs, grilled wild mushrooms in truffle oil, and two monstrous strips of bacon on it.  The house potatoes were rather good although I'm normally more of a hash brown guy. . The shrimp and grits were worth fighting over.  Strips of bacon covered on creamy grits, egg over easy, shrimp cooked to perfection with a pico de gallo type sauce over it.   Our server suggested a side of sourdough to dip in the grits which was a great suggestion.  . . Anthony Bourdain was right, this place rocks. Now food coma has set in and we just have to find a cab to get back to the hotel
eat. is my new favorite restaurant. I've heard nothing but good things about eat. and finally got to stop by for breakfast. Even on a Wednesday morning at 10AM, eat. was poppin'. The hostess who greeted us was beyond friendly and sat us at a small booth. I was immediately taken by the decor of the restaurant- It's simplistic and trendy at the same time.. . Now for the food. My oh my the food was delicious. I ordered a short stack of pancakes ($6) and my husband ordered the truffled egg sandwich with a side of seasoned potatoes ($12). My pancakes were golden brown, thick, moist, and fluffy. They were hands down, the BEST pancakes I've ever had. The syrup presented with the pancakes was in an adorable little jar. There were 2 pancakes, but they were so huge I couldn't even finish my plate. The Mister pretty much demolished his plate and stuffed himself into an "itis" state.. . The service was amazing! Can I just say that eat. has the cutest handful of waitresses I've ever seen in a restaurant? Bottom line: All the staff at eat. pitches in to make sure customers are happy. Me and the hubs can't wait to come back and try out their lunch menu!
Delicious!! This was my post EDC recovery meal.. . It's in downtown, but kind of located right next to some residential apartment housing blocks. Not too much sun cover walking over from my hotel, but there seems to be plenty of street parking. I should have just drove over.... . We were seated right away at around 12:30pm on a Monday with a party of 2. Service was quite fast and friendly. Actually, some waitress came over to chat about EDC with us, that was fun! :). . Anyhoo, based on recommendations, I got the Truffled Egg Sandwich. Yeah. It's goood. Eggs and mushrooms are rich and earthy. Bread is soft, warm, and wonderful. Bacon is crispy and delicious. I was a bit too full for the potatoes though!. . Beverage of the passionfruit iced tea. It's unsweetened, but with a bit of the raw sugar in it, it's great! Comes with free refills too.. . Mildly pricey but totally worth it.
What can I say about this gem. Prompt polite and pleasant service.  Trendy hip vibe. Great tasting food on the lunch menu. I had a chicken sandwich that was fresh, not over cooked, and on a soft roll. The vegetarian had a tofu and veggie sandwich that she claimed was pretty good.  We also tried there vegetarian chilli.  I would order it and i am a meat eater. the one outright i didn't care for was the potato salad. It tasted some bought out of one of those plastic tubs.  Don't worry though because you should be ordering the  delicious home made potato chips anyway.
We took the family here for a fourth of July treat. Parking was a breeze.  Food was amazing. I had the special of the day, prime rib hash. It was perfect!!! Service was good with a nice atmosphere. I will definitely go back.
Wasn't bad but wasn't good. My parents raved about it and gave me the cool story of this up-and-coming neighborhood plus the investment opportunities given to local business owners while we were driving here. I was pretty hyped on arrival but left with a lot to be desired. . . First, Pepsi products. Meh.. . The $4 sparkling lemonade was poured into a glass from a bottle. No real fruit or labor. Definitely overpriced.. . The pancakes were too bready. . The Huevos Motulenos: Eggs, chili, beans, cheese, tortilla and... bananas? Would have been okay except for the bananas. Didn't add anything to it and definitely tasted as weird as it sounds.. . Service was attentive so that knocks them up to 3 stars.
This is my favorite downtown breakfast place. They make lots of yummy items. My favorite as of now is the huevos moltolenos. Who would have thought that eggs, black beans, peas and bananas would go well together? Chef Nat! Thats who! . Friendly staff also! Ive been here at least a dozen times and will continue to go back!
On this visit I was not as impressed with the food as I was on my first visit.. . I came here for breakfast and ordered the 2 egg breakfast which comes with bacon, potatoes, and your choice of bread. My friend decided on the golden brown pancakes.. . While waiting for our food, the waiter puts down a side plate of packets of butter and 2 miniature containers of syrup. My friend and I decided to ask the owner about her choice of serving pre packaged butter and syrup. She told us it was more sanitary, they could tell how much syrup each customer used, and was more cost effective. Her answer was satisfactory until I really thought about it and my side of English muffins came out. The butter packet was on top of the English muffin and it was barely toasted and soggy. I thought to myself how many times those butter packets have been handled and how unsanitary it was sitting on top of my English muffin. . . On to the two eggs breakfast I ordered and my friends golden pancakes. The breakfast was fine however, the chicken apple sausage was very greasy. My friends pancakes were tasty but also greasy and the portion was ginormous.
Awesome! Great food. Very flavorful. The menu is small....that's a good thing. We had breakfast there on a trip to Vegas. From the coffee to shrimp and grits. You can't go wrong. "Eat" here!
Nice eatery spot. Had the grits and shrimp along with a pancake.  Very tasty.  The grits could have been seasoned a little more but were very good.  Now the pancake was extremely delightful and cooked to perfection.  The only thing I would recommend is for them to invest in a good maple syrup to be served warm other than using the miniature packaged jar. Would definitely go back as everything looked good to eat.
I'm so glad that we found this place and will definitely come back. It's a little bit of drive off the strip and as you pull up, it seems a little sketchy due to the neighborhood/attached to some kind of motel/travel lodge, but luckily it's a pleasant surprise as you walk in. It has a really homey/welcoming decor, great service, & food.. . The highlight of our breakfast was definitely the cinnamon biscuits with strawberries - it was like a dessert, but SO DELICIOUS. I got the truffle egg sandwich which was a B+ (it was good, but not great and the potatoes that accompanied it was just ok as well), but my partner got the Chilaquiles which was an A++ due to flavors and just really  yummy.  . . Anyway, I hope this place does well and that more people make it off the strip to try it. It's just a different experience than some place like Hash A Go Go so if you want a good breakfast - definitely try this place out.
Brilliant service and awesome food!. Best brunch place!!. The best pancakes I have ever tasted!. Service is excellent....big plus...u have a charging point inside at every other table almost which is awesome ;)
Ok, so it's not perfection, but I have to give it 5 stars based on what I see passes as a "4 star" place for breakfast/brunch on the Strip. Eat blows them out of the water.. . Service is friendly and efficient; helpful with a smile. What more do you need?. . Ambiance is cute, mildly hipster, but nothing over the top. Just a bunch of people digging good food.. . As for the food, the standouts for us were the Truffled Egg Sandwich and the pancakes. The pancake had a sublime lightness to them with a perfectly thin crispy exterior. Seriously one of the best I've had in a long time. Potatoes on the side were great as well. Other food was less than amazing (Chicken Fried Steak tasted good, but was just a little over done and the steak wasn't pounded quite thin enough, and Chilaquiles just lacked some oomph), but still good for the eating.. . Well worth the trip to downtown LV. Afterwards, we walked through the Container Park right across the street. Neat stuff.
I'm not going to lie! I love food and I really can be a food snob! This place is amazing! Best pancakes I've ever had! The service was great. The prices are average. Located in a cool downtown artsy area. This is a definite regular spot! If people visit this place is always on the list for breakfast!
This is great food, I am a corn beef hash snob. These guys have their own take on a classic and the do it deliciously. You can see. the food being prepared and the quality ingredients they use.
Stopped in for breakfast on 7/13/2014. We were seated after a few minute wait. I had the shrimp and grits and my girlfriend had the country fried steak with pork gravy. We thought the food was good, maybe slightly under seasoned for our taste. Our food came out rather quickly. The service was fantastic. We will definitely return.
Hip. Downtown. And Hip. This was one of the first places to put downtown on the map. eat. is always crowded and the food is very good (alas not great). Nothing I hate more than to hear someone who hasnt been to Vegas in years start dogging downtown. . . Past tense my friend.--- eat. has a very cosmopolitan crowd and should be the first step in enjoying the downtown experience. And besides I think Natalie smiled at me- who could want anything more.
It is a little bit of a walk from from the Downtown expirence but worth it.  The service is great the community table was fun.  But the truffle egg sandwich stole the show. Enjoy. It is behind not in container park
My ice water is literally the perfect temperature and I'm waiting on my roast beef sandwich!
What a delicious place! We were downtown for the day, trying to escape the Strip experience, and found this little spot. I got the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup. The other people I was with got shrimp & grits, pancakes, and chicken fried steak so I was able to sample a little bit of everything.. . The grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup was great! The sandwich was nice and thick and the cheese was nice and melty. I felt a bit ridiculous eating hot soup when it was 100+ degrees out, but I do love tomato soup and ended up scarfing down the whole thing.. . The shrimp and grits were good as well and the pancakes came with sausages which was a nice touch. I've never had a chicken fried steak I've liked, so I'm a bad judge as to how the one at eat. compares but the guy who ordered it had no complaints. Our waitress was extremely hospitable as well! Highly recommended!!!
This review is for eat.'s occasional fried chicken dinner, which only happens so often and requires advance payment and reservation.. . Always intriguing when a classically trained chef like Natalie takes on traditional food, and eat's fried chicken dinner is no exception.  A promised all-you-can-eat fried chicken meal with all the traditional fixings for $38 (cash only).. . It begins with homemade biscuits and cornbread, both warm as if only recently taken from the oven.  The biscuits are hearty, the cornbread perhaps too fluffy as it came apart very easily.  Both are accompanied by butter and artisan honey, which was a great dip for the biscuits (and the chicken skin as well).. . The entree is a mix of fried chicken served alongside mashed potatoes, collard greens, cheddar mac and cheese, and corn on the cob.  The chicken is well-cooked, with a batter of a unique blend of spices (guessing paprika, a touch of pepper, seasoned salt, and some oregano-like herb).  The collards are tasty witha hint of pepper kick, the mac and cheese is no-frills made with tasty cheddar, and the corn is seasoned with paprika.  The mashed potatoes weren't all too memorable, but skipping that at least leaves more room for the chicken.. . The meal is capped off by warm peach cobbler with a dollop of fresh cream on top.  Fresh peaches, warm from the oven, and the cream supplied a satisfying note that helped temper the heat and sweetness of the cobbler.. . The vibe for these dinners is a friendly one, people introduce themselves and experience the food alongside each other.  Natalie makes the rounds herself in her traditional plaid shirt and chuck taylors, making for a real communal ambiance that's in short supply in this town.. . You have to either visit regularly or follow eat. on Facebook to find out when the next one is, but once it's announced, get tickets and plan the diet accordingly.  This has to be one of the more unique dining experiences the already vibrant Vegas' dining scene provides.
Oh...my...goodness!  We just had the best breakfast experience.   My husband had the Chicken Fried Steak and I swear I saw his O face three times!  Haha!  The potatoes were seasoned perfectly and the country gravy was awesome.  . . I had the pancakes.  3 huge, fluffy with slightly crispy edges of goodness.  I don't eat lots of carbs so this was a perfect treat! They needed nothing on them!. . Service was great, very attentive and friendly.  This fun and funky hole in the wall joint is totally a do again.
The food here is fresh and prepared just right. I had a simple apple wood smoked bacon, eggs, home potatoes and a pancake. The home potatoes are seasoned perfectly. The bacon was crispy and full of flavor and the eggs were prepared as they should be. I had them scrambled but scrambled should be cook just before done then plated, that's where they finish cooking. Now the pancake.... A slight crisp to it and the inside fluffy and flavorful. The wait staff is pleasant and helpful if it's your first time. . I'll be back again and again. There is a wait and a little tight in the waiting area but again worth the wait. Enjoy your meal.
So disappointed!!! Arrived at Eat today at 11:45. We were so excited to finally try this place and had high hopes. We were a party of 13 and were told it would be an hour and 1/2. An hour and 1/2 seemed long but based on our party we accepted it and agreed to wait. We asked the hostess to take our number as we had 7 kids and wanted to let them play at the Container Park. The hostess agreed and said she would call us. About an hour and 15 min later we called to make sure things were on time. At that time I talked to a man who said they were running behind and it would be at LEAST 45 more minutes. This was VERY frustrating- not only would this be a 2 hour wait, it was 110 degrees we had 7 hungry kids AND they had our phone number and never called to tell us they were running behind. What ever happened to a professional courtesy or just good business practices.. We tried to wait and eventually 30 minutes later ended up down the road at La Comida. Later our friend called, talked to a manger who basically told her it wasn't their policy to "call" people because people "like her" usually don't answer their phones!!! Needless to say she was quite offended. We waited by the phone and were not "those people"! He then said they opened at 8:00 tomorrow if we wanted to come back. He said he wasn't prepared to offer anything for the inconvenience. Overall pretty bad experience and I don't think we will give them another chance. Get it together EAT!!!
Eat your heart out!. . I absolutely enjoyed brunch!!! . *Shrimp & Grits. *Cinnamon Biscuits. *Chive Potatoes. *Pancakes . . Definitely a must try and I will be back indefinitely... . . Short wait... Fast and friendly service!!
To start off, I had the Killer Grilled Cheese Sandwich (WITH BACON!!!) with Tomato Soup. I came on a trip to visit my friend who now lives in Vegas with a party of 7.. . Food: the food was so awesome. My sandwich was loaded with bacon. It's not one of those places that charges you several bucks for bacon and only puts two strips. They LOADED the bacon. (Thank you, Eat. I love you for that) The soup was super fresh and very tasty. It was topped with aged cheddar that was pretty much the cherry on top. . . The servers are very attentive and the cafe gives off such a good vibe. The decor is very hip and gives off an essence that Downtown Las Vegas is definitely trying to give off and own. I would come here again definitely.. . . Note: I wouldn't suggest coming in very large groups.
The food was good; however I believe restaurants in Las Vegas have forgotten the meaning of customer service. We went in around 10:30am on aweekday because this place gets really busy during peak breakfast and lunch hours. We got our bill and put 2 cards for them to split the check. They ran both cards and included a note about check splitting, i.e. "Dear check splitters, when we are slammed we will only take one card per table." I found this note after-the-fact quite rude, especially since they were not slammed. I see that it's a small place so a quick turnover is necessary. Still, this was an absolutely rude way to enforce a no check splitting policy. The policy was posted nowhere prior to paying our bill, nor was the note there when they brought us the check. I find this to be a ridiculous policy as far as customer service goes, but what was the point of telling us AFTER they split the check. Was this meant to "shame" us? If they are trying to let us know for "next" time, no worries with the multitude of restaurants available in Las Vegas, neither one of us will ever go back, that was so rude.
The cinnamon biscuits are awesome, and I almost always get the farm raised chicken sandwich.. . I normally hate potato chips with my meal, but Eat.'s are seasoned amazingly and always cooked to perfection.
New to Vegas and was exploring Container Park when we were told by a local about eat. We're beyond happy she did! Great feel and environment in the restaurant. Best Iced Tea I've ever had and we both loved our lunches. I got the Reuben and my wife got the grilled cheese with the tomato soup. If you're in the area.....GO!
If you are in Vegas and dont have a meal at Eat your trip is not complete. Fresh and kind of Funky fun staff will treat you right and the Coffee is perfect after a night of drinking.
I found this place on Yelp and decided to try it based on the reviews. I took my boyfriend and a couple of friends for breakfast. Amazing service, amazing food!!!! I got the truffled egg sandwich without the bread and my boyfriend got the shrimp and grits. Both dishes were mind blowing. . . This is in a not so nice area of downtown and is a fantastic little gem. I'm hoping to go back tomorrow for breakfast before we fly home. Their lunch menu looks great too!! . . A couple of tips: they don't split checks when they're busy and they only seat complete parties.
This place was better than expected. Sure, the neighborhood might be a little...questionable, but eat. makes sure to delight. I ordered the grilled cheese, and BLT so my best friend and I could try two things and we still aren't sure which we liked better. I'm going to go back soon so I can try their breakfast menu. I wish they served breakfast all day considering they are only open till 3.
This place is so bomb! . . Food is delicious, proportions are just right and the atmosphere is always welcoming. It definitely gets super busy, especially if you're trying to hit up a Sunday brunch but the line usually moves pretty quickly and there's a lot to keep you preoccupied while waiting so I usually don't mind.. . As for the food now the menu changes every so often, which isn't a bad thing. I used to get the Downtown Benny, which was basically and eggs benedict, eat. style, but I believe that is off the menu now. The beignets were very tasty while they were offering them, but those were replaced with cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote which are ever better. The Huevos Montellenos are really good as well, there's a surprisingly nice mixture of favors that compliment each well, so I would recommend that. Shrimp and grits are probably the best I've ever had, although I do not eat shrimp and grits often but it was de-lish here. Lastly, the Chicken Fried Steak, holy cow! Amazing. I would have never know how good a Chicken Fried Steak could be had not my boyfriend ordered. That's not really an item on the menu that calls out to me, but eat's was epic. A little heat to it, but I think that's what made it. Oh yeah, the portion for that is pretty big too.
I really like this place for a downtown dining option. My parents love the place as well. The truffled egg sandwich is so decadent and full of flavor. The country fried steak and eggs were spot on perfection. Add this to the super friendly service and you have a 5 star review! This is located right next to the container park so parking may be scarce at times, but with Carson kitchen and o-faced doughnuts right down the street it's a new hip locals scene.
I came to eat, I ate...and you should too! It takes an epic "Buzz" factor to divert my attention from the glitz glamour and opulence of the Las Vegas strip. After  several locals suggested this eatery, our brunch venue decision was unanimous. The location/building is quaint at first glance however the dining room is lofty, modern, and quite comfortable. My friend and I both ordered the 2 eggs brunch (I debated between that and the shrimp & grits). My meal included 2 eggs, country potatoes, bacon, and toast all of which I devoured within minutes. The portion size was perfect and while my selection may be quite comon in most American diners, eat quickly earned the #1 spot in areas of taste, value, and individuality. Our server (thin girl w/nose ring) was extremely friendly and warm, she offered suggestions and took care of us throughout our brunch hour. Will I be back, YES. Would I suggest eat to others, Yes! Enjoy!
Wow!!... What took me so long to finally get here.  When you finally go. . All If they have deviled eggs...simply AWESOME!!!
Saw EAT on yelp and decided to stop in for lunch. I am so glad we did.... wow.... I was really impressed. Atmosphere is so nice, even though the neighborhood is a little rough.. I had the DWBLTA sandwich (smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and chipotle mayo on sour dough bread) with the tomato soup. The sandwich was fantastic... everything was fresh and the sourdough bread was perfect. The tomato soup was seriously the best I have ever had! If you go to EAT definitely try the tomato soup!. My husband had the Shrimp and Grits, which is one of their signature dishes, it was incredible as well.. We will definitely be back!
Took the City bus (it was $8 for a 24hr bus pass) from the strip, got off at Fremont Street and walked I'm guessing around 10 blocks to Eat. . . We were there on a Sunday and they closed at 2pm as it said on Yelp, I called just to make sure and they told me their last seating was at 1:30pm and yes they close at 2. . . We walked in around 1:15pm, party of 2 and were seated right away. I looked over to my left to see this girl eating this huge portion of Chicken Fried Streak...it looked really good and I almost ordered it but after reading on Yelp how everyone loved the Shrimp & Girts I decided I would just have to come back for what she had. . . My friend ordered the Grilled Cheese & Tomato Soup, she said it was amazing. I enjoyed my Shrimp & Grits , so good I wanted more. Good size filling portions for sure.. . We also shared a order of the Cinnamon Biscuits which I didn't expect them to come out the way they did all covered in the most beautiful strawberry sauce. I thought they were just going to be biscuits with a strawberry/cinnamon jam to spread on to but oh no, it was like eating a dessert and since I don't like to share my dessert I was kind of sad I was sharing this...it was soooooo good. Whenever I come back I will always order the Cinnamon Biscuits to start. . . The only 2 things I didn't like about the place (and my reason I didn't give 5 stars) was they don't serve alcohol which I was surprised since it is Vegas, I really wanted to get a Mimosa or some kind of fun brunch drink....we just got off the plane a few hours ago and I was dying for something.  What I did get was the Passion Fruit Ice Tea which I wouldn't order again due to not tasting any of the passion fruit what so ever. . . Really I give 4.5 stars. I'll be back!
