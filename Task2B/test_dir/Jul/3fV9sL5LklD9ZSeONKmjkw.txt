Total disaster! The service was slow and the waiter arrogant. After 30 minutes of waiting the burgers came and one was over cooked. We sent it back only to wait some more than the manager got involved. After another 20 minutes the new burger came back raw!
The burgers are amazing! It doesn't matter if it's medium or well done, they all taste amazing and are extremely juicy! The staff is nice. Not rude or extremely kind. You will be at your table fast no matter how packed! The USA game was on and everyone was sitting at their table not planning on leaving anytime soon, but we still hopped in line and we were seated in less then ten minuets. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the price, but to some it might be worth it.
This was an excellent meal!  The service was fast and helpful and the good was fresh and you could tell only the freshest ingredients were used.  Had the Blue burger which was great.  Also had a spiked red, white and blue shake they were doing for the 4th of July holiday weekend and I never wanted it to end!  It was delish!    I highly recommend you stop in here if given the chance.
I'm a very picky eater and my boyfriend is a huge burger fanatic. We have heard good things about this place and decided to give it a try and we both were very pleased. I had a wonderful chicken sandwich and a great cocktail and he got a burger with a spiked milkshake. I highly recommend this place. Yes it can get pricey, but what place in Vegas isn't pricey. You will really enjoy this place I promise!
I saw the Burger Wars on the Food network and decided to check out all the hype. BLT won against Strip Burger & Holsteins so I was expecting a lot from this burger. As expected, service at the bar was good/efficient & overall ambiance were very cool, but sadly the Interstate 80 & fries were just OK (not great, not worth the price - but they have to pay for the expensive real estate in the Mirage). I have to try the other 2 places when I'm back next time. I don't mind paying more for GREAT food and that is what I've come to expect after all these years of coming to Vegas. It's too bad that this didn't really come close to delivering. :(
My friends and I came here because we wanted to eat something quick at the hotel we were staying at, and since most of our options during lunch were limited, we decided to come here.. . Food:. American Wagyu was just okay. When you see the words wagyu and truffle in the name and/or description, you can't help, but get excited to see how they executed the dish. I'd have to say that it was quite the fail. While I did taste the truffle, it did little to mask the dryness and blandness of the meat.. . Buffalo Fries - I don't know why it's one of their specialties. It's just fries with bleu cheese and buffalo sauce on the side. It definitely doesn't warrant the price tag.. . Service: Our server was a ghost! I didn't see him/her at all. Someone else took our order and a different person brought out our food.
I was not expecting much when my group decided that this was where we were going to eat. For me it was just another place to get a $15 burger, and there are more then enough of them in Vegas.. . However, I was surprised at how quickly we were able to get a seat and how good the service was. My drink was never empty, the food came out quick and my order was correct.. . I wanted to try something a little different and was feeling a little more adventurous (thanks alcohol!), so I went with the Tex-Mex Burger. Basically its a chili burger and it was awesome! A little messy but that is to be expected with an awesomely overloaded burger. . . My wife was kind enough to share some of her BLT burger which was equally as good as mine. It seemed like you just can't go wrong ordering anything here. The fries were above average but nothing to out of the norm. .  . Even though it is a little pricy for a burger it was worth it.
The American Wagyu burger (truffle aioli, portabello mushroom) was awesome, the 80 burger (cracked peppercorn crusted bacon, sharp cheddar, BBQ sauce, and caramelized onion) was delicious, and the lamb tandoori burger was gamey...but if you love lamb, maybe it'll be your fave. . . The buffalo fries were okay, and not even close to being as delicious as the buffalo fries at Guy Fieri's restaurant in The Quad. Seriously, Guy's fries are incredible. The BLT Burger buffalo fries are just curly fries with some bleu cheese and green onion on top, served with buffalo sauce and bleu cheese dressing. . . Guy Fieri's buffalo fries are this twisty thick-cut crispy fry, tossed in a little bit of buffalo sauce, covered in bleu cheese crumbles, and served with more buffalo sauce, Guy's "Bluesabi sauce" (wasabi bleu cheese dressing), celery and carrot sticks. If you like buffalo and you like fries, you've gotta check them out at Guy Fieri's joint. Cereal.
The burgers were okay. They were a little bit on the drier side. The burgers are a pretty good size. You can get a burger combo, with a side and alcoholic shake.  The shake was pretty good.  . . All in all, the burger isn't anything crazy special, there are better burger places on the strip.
Terrible. Burger came out way overcooked, and my bacon was burned black. I didn't have time to send it back, but I made a point of speaking with the server and telling him that considering the price of the food, it should be cooked properly. I was given a minimal discount and left still hungry. I left about 1/2 the burger uneaten. It was just too burned and tasted nasty.
I got the pimento burger. It's a typical gourmet burger place. It was really good. A little spicier than I thought but that was ok. . . Their mudslide shake with Oreo cookie was really good. . . For ~$13 per burger, you would think fries were included. Nothing else is included with that price.
Had the BLT Burger with cheddar, steak fries, and a Berry Me shake. OMG! It was amazing! Going to have to go again before vacation ends! Most excellent burger and the service was great!
Love the place. . Every time I feel like treating myself I go there. . Kobe beef burger is the best, although it is big!!! . Not complaining of course.. . . Come early to get a spot, it's a busy place, but the wait is worth it.
Good variety of food but my complaint about any restaurant in Vegas is that the food is so overpriced that I've already lost my appetite by the time the food's come out. . . Anyway, their salads, milkshakes, barbecue nachos, and ahi tuna sushi are not bad. But really I might have only liked it because I was staying at the Mirage and did not feel like dragging my body around Vegas in search for food. Who eats in Vegas anyway?
Had high hopes for this place but was a let down. I ordered a Tex-Mex burger and it was bland tasting. In that burger, the chili had mild flavor, the avocado was okay and the medium level cooked meat wasn't proper tasting. The tandoori lamb burger was decent. It had a good mix of flavors. The burger prices were high and didn't include fries. They serve half pickle and it tasted bitter. Good service, nice menu variety. Disappointed by some these gourmet, fancy fast food joints. 2.5 stars.
Crowded, but if you get the pimento cheese burger & buffalo fries you won't be sorry.
We came here for lunch because we heard they have excellent burgers...what a waste of money. 4 burgers, 2 orders of fries and 1 Coke with 20% left for tip came to $116. Worst part...the service was not good and the food was not that great either. . . The waiter was not very attentive, first not filling up our water so we sat without drinks. Then after he brought the food he disappeared, so we could not tell him that one of our orders of fries were very overcooked and we did not want them because they tasted very bad. Also one of the burgers was missing cheese...we were however still charged for the cheese when we got the bill so that mistake was on the kitchen, not the waiter's fault. . . So in our visit the waiter screwed up twice and the kitchen screwed up twice. Considering the price of the meal i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.. . Everyone agreed that their burgers we ok, decent flavor but nothing special. So i would rate the burger itself 3 stars over all. They were ok.
