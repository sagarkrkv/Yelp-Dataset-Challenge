I came to Tao as a side trip for EDC, and about half way through the meal, I felt like I came to Vegas for Tao, and EDC was just a side trip. . . I ate at Tao with a group of 8 people - family and friends, all a bunch of young adults in our twenties. We ordered family style (many plates in the center of the table to share), and in total, we destroyed 8 delicious dishes and a beautiful dessert smorgasbord. Every single thing we tried was delicious. I am spoiled in that my parents take me to nice places on occasion, and Tao is at the top 5 of my list of best meals I've ever eaten. One friend who ate with us said - and I quote, "This is probably the best meal I will ever eat in my life." I am going to New York this fall or winter and plan to eat at the Tao restaurant in New York with my boyfriend. You can expect to hear another review on that restaurant soon. . . My favorite dishes of the meal we had include: . - The flavorful 28 days aged new york steak which melted in my mouth. - The miso glazed Chilean Sea Bass which tasted like it was injected with the best sauce ever created. Every bite gave you a gush of flavor, and it was cooked just right.. - The Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll with Edamame which came with a not-too-spicy wasabi dipping sauce.. - The delicious mixed sashimi platter which had a wide variety of sashimi including fatty tuna. . - The gorgeous display of desserts (also ordered family style) which came with a hilarious and delicious giant fortune cookie and sweet dipping cream. The fortunes were Vegas-themed and made us laugh. . . The atmosphere was nice and our server, Jeffery, was amazing. He always came at the right time, promptly filled our glasses, and was extremely helpful with the ordering process. He was absolutely hilarious, and super friendly. His language is what puts him over the top. The way he described the food as we were ordering was something from a movie or commercial. He used 2-3 descriptive - and one would even say seductive - adjectives for each dish. It's hard not to order them when he describes them that way. My brother put it best when he asked Jeffery, "Could you please describe the food to me like that as I'm eating it?" About a quarter of the way into our meal, the manager even came out to make sure we were all enjoying our food. . . All in all, it was a perfect dinner, and a fantastic way to start our crazy night at the Electric Daisy Carnival.
Every time I'm in Vegas I stop here for dinner at least once, great service it's beautifully decorated and I love the Kobe beef!
Dinner was good. Service was good. Went to nightclub for free for being dibner guest. Good atmosphere.
Incredible service! Mike was such a great server. He had great suggestions, and was very attentive. The atmosphere is great, and I highly recommend the STS Roll.
I come to Tao each time I am in Vegas. The food is always great. I'm giving 3 stars based on experience this time around. We had a great dinner. Food was wonderful and the lychee martini was right on point. . After dinner, we should get stamped to enter Tao Nightclub.... No one ever came up to us for a stamp. We walked up to the front desk and they directed us to the bouncer in front to get stamped. I came up to him letting him know we just finished dinner and didn't receive our stamp, his response was to get in line. I told him we just stepped out of dinner and were told to come up to him... "Did you hear what I said, you need to get in line. You are not going to cut all these people. " I was in shock. How can someone reply that way? Raising his voice at me.. With attitude.... I am not 13 trying to sneak into a club. . Nevertheless, I wasn't about to stand in a line that wrapped around the floor AND deal with his attitude again. Extremely disappointed. An experience like this reunited my view on Tao.
Group of 5 ladies, came here on a Saturday night during the 4th of July holiday. First of all, the hostess with the blonde hair and orange dress was a total petty bitch and did not want to seat us. Had us waiting for over an hour for a table when we saw several open. We would have at least ordered drinks and  appetizers but there was no service in the waiting area. The waiting area was blaring with loud EDM music, not at all conducive for dinner or lounge talk and definitely scared us a bit thinking that the club would be the same. Meanwhile, troops of people with questionable attractiveness and boldly comfortable physiques would trapes in every few minutes heading over to the nightclub area. We were already on the guestlist for the party but having had good history with their sister company, Lavo, we wanted to try the food first,  but in these moments, both the dinner and club scene here were so off putting. The night started off quite weak. Once we were seated, after 12, finally the service came pouring in. At least 3 or 4 servers came to our table to excuse the slackness and eager to be of service. Nice view of the big Buddha statue in the center. Food was decent, we enjoyed the pan fried chicken gyoza, the lobster wontons and the rock shrimp lettuce cups were ok, we kind of got full off of just appetizers cause again, large portions. My cousins miso sea bass entree was good. Strong miso flavor, but if you're cool with that, its good. Big portion of chicken pad thai by someone else. I dont like pad thai or peanut tastes so i didnt taste it but she enjoyed. Looked big and fresh. I split the shrimp, lobster, scallop in bean sauce entree with someone else because it sounded big and also to cut costs and have more things on the table to taste. Was really looking forward to it, it has all of my favorite meaty chewy seafoods. It was shockingly bad, dont know if there was an error made in the sauce recipe, but I have had plenty of similar dishes in the past, never have any been half as bad, and it came highly recommended by the waiter and was amongst the most expensive so we were surprised that it was so bitter. The table tasted and agreed that the sauce had an unpleasant taste. The waiter took it off of our bill gracefully and we left a great tip in exchange. In this moment, the great service that we are accustomed to from Lavo, was thankfully shining through here at Tao as well. A nice chick came to our table to stamp us and set us up for the complimentary club access. As I said before, we were already on the guestlist so didnt need it, but its nice that they have that additional incentive for dining there, as Lavo used to do. Will continue nightclub review in other yelp page.
Hostess could use a lil help with customer service, other than that the waiter was great, definitely made up for the hostess lack of customer service.  The ambiance is hip and music is loud.  Good place to hang out for birthday, bachelor, bachelorette or girls/guys night out.  Food is really good.  My favs are the sea bass, Kobe beef  sashimi and anything on the sushi menu.
Terrible service and not a good experience at all.. . It is very clear that this restaurant only welcomes those for whom money is of no consequence as they literally tried to take as much money from us as possible.. . First of all, we were asked, "Still or sparkling?" Thinking these were our only choices and still must equal tap water, we asked for still. That was a $24 mistake. Although we ended up getting the manager to take it off our bill, it caused a huge hassle.. . When ordering my $14 vegetarian meal, the waiter stopped me mid-sentence and told me I needed to try their Kung Pau tofu dish. Although mildly annoyed to be told my choice was wrong, I was excited to try this off-menu item.  It ended up being too spicy for my taste and I switched meals with someone else.  Fast -forward to when the check came and I found out the meal he had convinced me to order was almost twice the price of the meal I originally had picked out. Needless to say, I felt a little cheated.. . The meal I did end up eating was good.... Vegan Pad Thai with Gluten free noodles. (Yes, it was also appreciated that they had GF options!)  we were also able to use their buy-one-get-one promotion for cocktails as it was happy hour. However, everyone at the table was really disappointed and rather indignant at the service that was given. . . The cuisine was good but the experience was marred by the sub-par service and the costly extras.
Service was good (our server waa attentive)  the food was just OK - nothing special.  I wouldn't recommend...
We went here last night with a birthday party of 14. We arrived early but had to wait 45 minutes after our reservation to be seated which really made a lot of us cranky and frustrated.  When they sat us on the main floor we noticed an empty elevated long table section near us that was totally empty and could have accommodated us. The energy of the birthday girl was off at this point but we tried to cheer up the mood. We ordered the $75 per person family style menu because everyone was so hungry and agitated we knew if we all ordered individually itwould further throw the party into a black hole.  Some guests were just saying bring out food, anything will do. . . The line for the night club portion was piling up and packing the staircase which was horrible because it became a major task just to get to the restroom on the 2nd floor.  Security initially told the girls that was the only one while we were initially waiting to be seated so we did not know any better that there was a restroom on the main floor. . . A girl came around and stamped our wrists and told us this is to get into the club upstairs after we finish dinner which seemed like a cool option that the restaurant seemed to give patrons and we decided that we would stay for the club after dinner instead of hesding out to Ballagio.  This later became a ridiculous ordeal because as we went up the packed staircase with our entire party the bouncer at the top stated that the stamp now did not give us admission but got us past the line outside. He told us to all go to the front door. . . The look of disgust on the birthday girls face summed it up and trying to patronize the place further would just lead to further aggravation. . . The only reason I gave this place one star is because the food was really good but I can't be really sure because when you are starving anything tastes good and some of the girls last meal was around noon so we were pretty hungry.
They may say Tao is meant to be a spiritual dining experience, but after our terrible night there I was closer to wrathful sin than enlightenment. . . I made a reservation at Tao for the second anniversary of the first date I had with my girlfriend. We came all the way to Vegas from San Diego, and we were curious about Tao's because of the interesting decor etc. . . Quite literally the moment we arrived the atmosphere became oppressive. Our biggest concern and the truly unforgivable factor in this ordeal was that the very second we arrived, there was a security guard playing on his phone who for some reason or other determined we were criminals of some sort.. He was large, Caucasian, and messy haired (I only write this in the hopes that the management will read this review at some point and give him a stern talking to), this lummox of a man took one look at us and apparently instantly decided we were up to no good. I have no idea why, we were a young couple, well dressed, happily chatting etc. He didn't take his eyes off of us for the entire night, he followed us when we went to the host to claim our reservation (which just FYI took about ten minutes or so after our reservation time), he followed us to our seats, glowering the whole time. He checked in on us every now and again, just standing a bit away from us trying (and failing) not to be obvious about it. When we had eaten and we started to head out he was coming back to check on us again, the moment he saw us he turned back around and started speaking into what I assume was an earpiece. Not subtle at all... My girlfriend at this point was incredibly upset; she didn't know if he was sizing us up as criminals, drooling over her (she is very attractive), or if he thought her mid length skirt was a sign she was a hooker or something (no way...her outfit was very tasteful). Either way she walked straight out. I however walked up to our forboding shadow and asked if there was a problem and why he had been glowering at us all night. He responded with "Oh its just... Nothing..." and looked away. Very nice, Tao... Treat your patrons like criminals and then halfheartedly try to cover it up with lies... . . But that aside on to the restaurant itself. . . The atmosphere at Tao is admittedly very nice, trendy music playing constantly beats like the pounding heart of the restaurant. Clumsy Asian inspired art does its job in setting an oriental-fusion mood for the dining hall, watched over by a giant Buddha, overdone but altogether nicely set. . . Unfortunately the atmosphere is the best part of the restaurant. We had two people help us with our meal, a bus boy who was obviously better trained than any other member of their staff came, introduced himself, welcomed us to the restaurant and got us some water in a cordial yet amiable manner. I wish I had a better memory for names because if I could single him out for the managers I'd say he deserved a promotion.. . Our actual waiter on the other hand never even bothered introducing himself, he was rushed and a bit curt if I'm being honest. but he did take our orders and get our food to us so there's that much... In his defense he did seem to have a full load in his section but it was still off-putting, that he didn't even say "Hi", just "So what can I get for you folks tonight"... . . The food itself was well... okay... I mean it was nice, don't misunderstand, it was good food. Just not great, definitely not worth what they asked for. I had the Crispy Thai Pork which almost seemed like it came out of a frozen meal package, and my lady had Spicy Chicken which oddly enough was less spicy than my dish, in fact the chicken itself was rather bland. So the food was a bit of a let down too. . . They were also out of most of my favorite beers, Tiger, Sapporo etc. so I settled for a warm Kirin out of the bottle. Not much to say other than well, warm beer. . . All in all I sadly have to warm away anyone who actually wants to have a good time in Vegas. Tao is rife with ridiculously bad staff and disappointing food. Do not ruin your evenings as we did by frequenting this travesty of a restaurant.. . Boy I wish we had just ordered Room Service...
Good Asian Fusion in a terrific setting within Venetian. Check out the pipes along the wall and the decorative artwork, then enjoy a top-notch meal. Get ion before the crowds show up and have a leisurely batch of small plates to share around the table.
Whenever someone asks me what my most favorite food is, I always say the Honey Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass at the Tao Restaurant. This is one of those dishes that when you taste it, your eyes roll backwards and all you can say is Oh.... My God. It is that good.... No lie. I like the restaurants decor with its upscale/trendy/Asian style. High ceilings that create a feel of openness. Interesting art, sculptures and artifacts that adorn the walls. This place offers everything you would expect to find in a 5 star restaurant. Excellent service,innovative gourmet food and fine dining. Expect to spend a lot of moola.
Food and service was phenomenal! . Loved the short ribs, the tempura scallops were the best I've ever had. . Prepare to wait unless you have a reservation. . It's pretty loud in there but to be expected you are in Vegas :)
