Nice, comfortable rooms......nothing flashy....nothing gross.
What I like most about this hotel and casino is that I can actually breathe.    Our reservation was originally for the Orleans Hotel and Casino for the onsite children's center and we had arrived and walked into the Orleans Hotel and was immediately assaulted by the overwhelming stench of cigarette smoke and perfume used to cover the smoke smell.. . So, we left the casino to stay at the Monte Carlo for the lazy river and wave pools and were very happy with our stay.  Any small issue we had was corrected immediately, the place is clean and they have an all day-all you can eat buffet for a decent price!. . BAD:  no wifi, in room dining staff did not take away the cart for two days.   We called them to take it away as they instructed us to do and we left it in the hall and when we left two days later- it was still there.   Most of the table dealers have no personality.   But I try and look over that because they probably deal with assholes and idiot tourists  every day.
My husband and I recently stayed at the Monte Carlo for one night (6/17) since I had a comp room through MyVegas. We arrived in the evening and didn't find a line at the check-in desk.  The clerk who helped us was friendly but appeared to be new since he needed assistance from another clerk.  No problem.  Finding the elevator to get to our room was easy. When we entered the room, it was spacious with two comfortable beds.  The bathroom was okay.  One think I did notice though, unlike most other hotels where you would find a clock.....there was none.  I had to keep checking my cell phone for the time.  We headed down to the MLife desk to redeem a comp for two buffets.  Luckily, the courtesy clerk was nice enough to explain that if we didn't use the comp for that night, we'd lose it.  We took her advice and used it for another night, when we had more time. We instead redeemed another comp for a free pint of beet at The Pub. After venturing out for a couple of hours, we returned to the hotel and headed straight for the food court.  Glad they have one. We slept pretty good but like most other hotels, you do hear people next door or out in the hallways.  When it was time to check out the next day, instead of going back to the front desk, I found the express check-out box close by.  There was a computer on top of it for guests to print out their receipts.  I only wanted to drop the room keys in.  A guest was taking her time at the express check-out box.  Maybe, they can just leave the box by itself so guests can just drop their keys in without waiting.  We left our bags with at the bell desk since we were going to check out the surrounding areas.  The bell man was accomodating and very friendly.  The next time we will have to stay longer than one night.
Been a few years since we stayed here.  . I travel to Vegas often for work and for fun.  . Couples get aways, WCC tourney and girl trips....so been a few places.. Not an expert but maybe my info can help someone out.  I always do reviews before I travel to see the most up to date info.. . Review is for our family of 4 doing a long weekend getaway July 3-6.. Girls are 13 and 10.  Pretty mature for their ages, love to travel....we knew kids in Vegas was going to be a bit tricky so a little more planning on this one.  . . I've stayed at many hotels and admit I'm getting spoiled.  Monte Carlo came to be not because it rivals the Bellagio dripping in luxury (seriously go VIP at the Bellagio, it rocks.) BUT I needed a good location and most important a really great pool for the kids.  Monte Carlo does it right in the pool area.. . Check in: Don't fear the line, they move it well.  It was a breeze and everyone was very friendly.   I've never tried the $20 sandwich trick or even just bribing for an upgrade but I was talking about how happy I was to finally get to the hotel after a 3hr flight delay and as we wrapped up he upgraded me to a higher floor.  Very nice.  I tipped just because he was so nice to work with and that was a great gesture after long travel. . . Room: Good, not great.  I've seen some pics from other reviewers and I knew what to expect.  Amenities are fine, space is fine.  My only issue is the beds and pillows.  I can't get a good night sleep here.  On the firm side which I don't normally mind, but just...not good. Housekeeping ladies are awesome.  Monte Carlo gets a HUGE Plus for having in room coffee and 2 bottle waters daily.  Wifi isn't great though and I have Verizon....only get one bar in the room.  Busy holiday weekend and we didn't even experience any noise from other guests.. . Dining: You can see the list of what they have but I can say when you need to get something relatively inexpensive, it doesn't get any better.  Of course McD and Subway prices are a bit jacked up but I also didn't hike/drive to get to them.  Great range of dining in the hotel  Before the Blue Man Group we took a chance on Dragon Noodle (see my reviews on each of those) and it was AWESOME.. . Hotel: Layout is so smart.  From check in, elevators are close saving a trek through the casino.  Pool is super easy to get to, near the elevators.  Food court is near by too.  Most manageable layout for a strip hotel and make it a great choice for families.. . Pool:  LOVE.  Crowd ranges and ...well you see it all.  Come as you are, you'll fit in.  Show your key, they check for glass in bags.  Small shop has essentials and if you want a cold beer w/o having to wait (or tip) you can get it here like grabbing a soda.  TIP: you can rent inner-tubes to use in the main pool or lazy river OR bring your own, buy in the gift shop or ABC store.  They will inflate anything you have.  For our 3 day stay we bought 2 med ones for $12 each in the gift shop.  Deal.   Food prices are on par for Vegas. Service this busy weekend has been great.. . Lazy river, wave pool and main pool, volleyball court w sand.....many places for beverages and BONUS, free water cooler (watermelon infused) so you can stay hydrated. Only one bathroom area though.  DJ at the top of the wave pool area starts at noon, so fun.  No drinks in wave pool or lazy river.  All seating gone by 9am, no joke. Clears out some by noon. . . Cabanas: 3 styles and unlike some hotels where the high rollers get first crack and pricing is obscure...this is easy but reserve in ADVANCE!  We knew this was prime time to hit the pool and I wanted one day where we didn't have to stress over seating.  . . Only 8 full cabanas, near lazy river/wave pool.  TIP: Do not get #8 unless you get a deal, it is by the bathrooms and on a walkway, worst location ever.. They have about 11 lazy river day beds, 2 with pergola like things so you can use curtains to shield. Include a fun queen sz bed with 2 lounge chairs, towels, 2 tubes.  Or, the basic which we got, and it is so fun...umbrella with the bed and 2 lounge chairs.  Service is awesome and attentive.  . . TIP: For the cost of the rental, you can apply ALL food and bev charges towards that.  Family of 4?  I should be able to do that by noon lol.  Husband was gonna hit Starbucks and I tripped him walking away,  no way, we are eating at the cabana ONLY today!! That is a deal.  I did not get that offer at Bellagio or Caesars cabanas.  FYI we paid top pricing for saturday on the holiday weekend, so $400, plus they add 18% gratuity and tip.  Well spent IMO.  If no one has rented by noon I heard you can "make an offer" too.. . Hotel Location: Great. My little one isn't a fan of walking and the 13yr old can shop 24/7.   This is perfect.. . Recap: I researched for days and days to make this trip work for kids.  Top 3 hotels for families are consistently MGM, Mandalay and Monte Carlo.  This one for price, amenities and location win IMO.
GOT A GREAT DEAL TO STAY READ THIS!. . We found a deal for $50 a night for a deluxe room. We wanted to stay where our 4 year old would have fun at pool. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!. . Carpets stained on 5th floor room and hallway.Elevators doors showing previous signs of graffiti gonna post a pic of that. Our AC in the room we got on this floor room 135 didn't work well. They brought great excuses. . . We moved to 30th floor after complaining.  There was broken pieces of glass in hallway I complained about 3times never taken care of. Mold in shower, stains on carpet. Just gross !. . 30 minutes in line to check in which looked like it only got worse. . To many people at pool water looked very cloudy and gross . . We are taking the loss and moving hotels today.. . I AM EDITING CAUSE WE ARE CHECKING OUT TO GO ANOTHER HOTEL AND I WANTED TO ADD TO THIS.. . No blow dryer in bathroom! When we called down they were acting like we couldn't find it! 40 minutes before we got it.. . GLASS STILL IN HALLWAY AFTER TELLING THERE HOTEL STAFF ON 6 DIFFERENT OCCASION.
Stayed here for a night on July 4th weekend.  The rooms are your standard rooms, nothing crazy.  . . Even though the hotel is aging, their rooms are still clean.  Our room had a coffee maker in it. It was a nice morning pick me up.. . Didn't get to go to the pool, but they have a lazy river, beach volley ball and something that looked like a wave pool.. . They have a food court, near the lobby that has MCDs, sbarros, subway, rubios, starbucks and a couple of other places to grab a quick bite.. . I would go back and stay, if the price was right.
Stayed here July 3-6 in a deluxe room. My girlfriend and I were able to obtain 3 comped nights via myVegas on a holiday weekend - can't beat that!. . Location: Great location close to the middle of the strip. The hotel has a free tram that connects to Aria and Bellagio, a major plus in the summer heat. Another plus is the huge parking structure and a dedicated street via Rue de Monte Carlo, accessible from LV Blvd. and Frank Sinatra, making it easy to get in/out of the hotel.. . Check In/Out: Check in late Thursday night was a breeze, but I saw huge lines on subsequent days while passing through the lobby. The hotel was never too crowded and its layout is simple and easy to navigate, which was a big plus for me on a busy trip. The front desk was helpful with our requests, which included a room change and reservation change (from my girlfriend to me).. . Rooms: Originally got a 5th floor room (which overlooked a generator) but were able to move up to a 19th floor strip view room our second day (19321). Rooms are middle of the road - I've stayed at better, I've stayed at worse. A little rough around the edges and a bit outdated, but the room was clean and the bed comfortable.. . Amenities: Of what was covered by the $22 resort fee, we took advantage of the 2 bottles of water and internet, which was wired (outdated, but needed due to the shoddy wifi in the hotel). The pool area and LAZY RIVER is a must-visit if you're staying at the hotel in the summer months.. . Dining: I found the dining here to be overpriced, even for the Strip. Skip the food court, if possible - I paid almost $9 for a 6" Subway and bag of chips. Yusho and Double Barrel restaurants caught my eye but the prices drove me elsewhere. I heard the buffet was no good, so we skipped that. There are a few highlights, however: Tried Blvd. Creamery, where they have interesting alcoholic ice cream/sorbet. I ate at Diablo's a few years back and if they still have it, the $40 burrito was a great deal. . . Entertainment: Blue Man Group is the headliner here. If you can't catch them, they have a free processional through the lobby at 6:15 PM. Due to its location, it is easy to check out club and show offerings of other hotels. Only gambled my first night here and broke even. If you're new to gambling, take advantage of a free daily 11 AM craps lesson!. . Overall: About as middle-of-the-road as you can get in Vegas. The Monte Carlo's location, ease of access, and pool make for its shortcomings. Price-wise, it's usually comparable to TI, Bally's, Tropicana and NYNY. Although not my favorite hotel from that group, I would stay here again without hesitation.
In my opinion one of the better budget options on the strip.  My go to place to stay when my favorites are a bit too pricey.  Stayed here several times including two stays during Memorial Day weekend.. . Room:. The rooms are usually clean, but outdated.  There can be some cleanliness issues as others have mentioned but for the most part I did not ever feel disgusted.  My only complaint would be the restroom, specifically the shower.  The water pressure is terrible and the temperature does not get boiling hot as I like.  This is a big drawback for me as I enjoy taking several showers a day after dealing with the dessert heat, and I like my showers hot!  So if these are your pet peeves, hope you get lucky with a decent shower.. . Location:. Definitely a positive, and one of the reasons I would choose to stay at the Monte Carlo over some of your other cheaper options.  There is a free tram that connects you to the Aria/City Center and Bellagio.  We used the tram to get us to the Bellagio and took a short walk through the resort to connect to Caesar's and also to Planet Hollywood across the street.  Trams take no more than 15 minutes to arrive.  You can also walk into the Aria directly through the same walkway that takes you to the tram.  . . Pool:. The pool is also definitely a positive, and would be a factor in why I would choose to stay here.  There are 3 pools, a regular pool, a small lazy river, and a wave pool as well as a beach volleyball court!  The pool area itself is small and can be difficult to find a few chairs, usually we were able to find some next to the volleyball courts.  You can check outa volleyball from the desk with an I.D., however pay attention to the ball as we were constantly hitting it over the wall into the street, and had to go chase it down using the exit doors.  The surrounding buildings also tend to fill the pool area with shade earlier than other resorts which can be a good or bad thing.  There is also a Dj that plays music on top of the wave pool which can be heard throughout the area, definitely more catered to the party scene than the relaxing scene but wasn't a problem as I was still able to nap comfortably.  . . Food:. Recently remodeled front entrance and added a 800 Degree Pizza which was not bad but not comparable to Blaze Pizza in Souther California IMO, which I felt they were trying to contend with, a good ice cream place BLVD Creamery, as well as a few other places I have not tried.  Brand Steakhouse is really good though!  Would definitely recommend this steakhouse, great place for a large party as you can share a 120 oz steak for $250.  It's supposed to be shared by 6 people but we were able to share it amongst 8 of us (6 guys and 2 girls) and it was filling.  The sweet creamed corn is also highly recommended.  Lastly there is a food court with your usual McDonald's running 24 hours, Subway 24 hours, and Sbarro which was almost 24 hours.  The line for McDonald's late night did get really long so prepare to wait.. . Overall I would recommend staying at the Monte Carlo if you are with a group of friends looking for a place to stay with a good pool, good cheap food options, and good location.  If you are staying with your significant other and looking for a little bit nicer place, I'd say it would be a hit or miss depending on the room you get.  I would definitely stay here again depending on the price and would recommend it to others as well.
Thishotel was what we needed it to be, a clean room and comfy bed and it helped that there were some great dining and entertainment choices downstairs. . . We stayed during the week and came for a conference so we avoided the high weekend prices. I would definitely suggest coming during the week if you can, it's always packed but you can save some money and still have a really entertaining time. . . This was our first time in Vegas so I'm sure if you browse around you can find some great deals in some great rooms, but as far as I'm concerned the Monte Carlo was great.
Well let me just start with we booked ahead of time during the week for my husband's 40th birthday. Which is something he was really looking forward to.  Going to Vegas to celebrate sounded like a great idea at a time. I guess we should've did more research on the hotels. First off it was way to families &  kids running around everywhere makes an adult feel weird about drinking in front of kids. Second the check-in my was super Duper long and moving slow like you were the themepark! Third the front desk clerk didn't really know anything and had to call to see what was going on, then proceeds to tell us that there would be an additional $50 a day charge plus $20 daily resort fees on the spa room that we booked which was fine for deposit but daily deposits on the same room that your staying in for a consistent number of days I just didn't understand that!! & the part that made me upset was it didn't mention any of this online.. So instantly I felt like we were getting ripped off I think hidden fees are just wrong I'm sorry people should know what they're looking forward to spending ahead of time and not thrown for a loop when you get there. . So then I asked my husband let's just be sure and ask the lady at guest services; she goes on to Tell us in a very nasty way oh she should have charge you'll  $100 a night deposit for the spa suite! I looked at her and said well you all should list these prices and fees on your website and not trick people once they get to your hotel for their stay. But anyway they told us they no longer honor the birthday comps or  coupons they offer on their site so he was kind of feeling down about that but was like oh well. The buffet which he really looked forward to going to was very overrated this was in their hotel!! Way too pricey for the little bit of stuff they offered and it was self-service.. In the mornings the housekeeper knocked then just entered the room so if you were unclothed or indecent she just barged in!! . The cocktail waitresses never came back if u happened to see them you have to run them down for one.. Which when some people are gambling it's kind of nice to not have to chase a drink down.. The room itself was okay kinda dated the jacuzzi tub was the only  good point for me.. I'm usually pretty open and easy when it comes to reviewing things but this was very disappointing which was sad for me because his birthday was ruined.. Service was just terrible .. We checked out early and went to a different place.. But all in all we will never stay there again
Disappointing! They charged an extra $20 per night  for services like coffee and water bottles. The fee was reversed after I talked with a manager and showed booking paper work. Another 15 minute chat. Pool closes at 7, even during summer. Multiple calls from security letting us know our door was ajar. It was closed and locked.
Terrible customer service and dirty rooms. Key lock broke and they caused us to miss dinner reservation because they refused to fix timely. Then room had open hot sauce in desk when we checked into it. Shower head was broke and to top it off had a bug crawling in bed. Pick somewhere else to stay for sure!
Didn't get a chance to stay here but I did play here!  By far the friendliest blackjack dealers I have played with.  Makes a big difference.  3/2 blackjack is important to anyone who is series about the game.  Great food choices, love the asian restaurants, friendly service people, clean casino.  Great location.  Some nice shopping options.  If you like beer they The Pub is a must!!!  I will try to stay here next time.
Stayed here enjoyed it. The room was clean and I love the casino.
Got a really great deal on lasvegas.com. i paid $157.00 includin resort fees and a $35 food or drink credit. Me and my husband stayed sunday and monday. They let us check in at 8am with no extra fee which was awsome cause ive had other places charge me for early check in. Everyone was incredible nice from the receptionist to the housekeepers. They Always tried making conversation. . . Pros:. Room was pretty big nice comfy bed. Had a little desk. Bathroom was a good size. It was soooooo easy to get around that hotel everythin was a turn away. I loved it. I never got lost.. . Cons:. Wifi only worked in the first 2 floors. Otherwise it was dial up in your room. There were no ammenities.. . You guys really gota check out rio.
This review is based on our experience at the casino. This place seems pretty average to me. The ceilings are beautiful and the music is pretty good. I just didn't like that it smelled like someone had pooped or something. The buffet here seems cheaper. Drink service was pretty slow here.
Great hotel to stay at! Especially If you get the strip view rooms you can see a lot of the new City-center complex, MGM and some of New York-New York. . . The pool layout is similar to Mandalay bay and MGM, but on a much smaller scale with a Lazy river, wave pool, Jacuzzi, and a regular swimming pool. . . The food court has some good options including: McDonalds, Subway, Rubios, Manchu-Wok, Sbarro, Starbucks, and the original Chicken tenders. . . They have a mall called: the street of dreams which leads to a free monorail system that takes guests to Aria and Bellagio which is perfect for anyone who wants to catch a fountain show without too much walking distance, or for anyone to just look around City center! . . I would definitely recommend the Monte Carlo resort we've stayed there since the beginning and we've never had any complaints. This resort really offers a solid product for an affordable price!. . PS: BLUE MAN GROUP! enough said.
I stayed here this past weekend and loved it! The casino was super chill. lots of good slots. awesome foot court. the lazy river was dope with $20 daquiries. the room on the 27th floor strip view upgrade was great. the staff was super friendly and helpful. loved having a mcdonalds starbucks and subway downstairs. lots of tables to play and walking distance to the bellagio. would definitely stay here again.
My second stay at monte carlo. I love this hotel. Its on the strip, easy access, back entrance for valet parking, great staffs, great services, great valets, great atmosphere, ambiance people.  Its not crowded and its nice and quiet. Although we didn't get a strip view but thats okay. Giant comfy cozy king size bed non - smoking room fabulous!  2 free breakfast buffet! Yay! Affordable prices, would definitely come back and enjoy this hotel again
Customer service sucks as far as the desk employees i was super disappointed  every person i dealt with at the front desk lobby was super poor. only good experience i experience here was the casino floor and the room cleaning employees were great. The lady at the check in lobby messed up and had me running around like a dummy. Finally an hour and change after checking in i was in my room thank goodness there wasn't a long line at the check in or else it would have been horrible double the time. i had fun and enjoyed the hotel room and such but i was just disappointed in the customer service of the people at the front desk lobby. I reserved a certain room and gave me something i didn't ask for. whats the point of reserving the room i asked monte carlo front desk employee after the mix-up i couldn't get an answer. I'm gonna think twice about coming here again.
Got this hotel on a package deal with Southwest Airlines... hotel overall is dirty and dingy.  Would rush my showers just to get out of there.  The toilet made a crazy noise whenever we flushed it, it was kind of scary...  . . The check in line was always long... At first they told me the wrong room number, went up to the 24th floor and tried my key, wouldn't work... went all the way back downstairs and they gave me the correct room number.... . Needs renovations to keep up with the nicer hotels on the strip.  Buffet breakfast was just so-so, would not eat there again even if it was free.  . . Would consider staying at this hotel again only if it was free...
Reserved non smoking room,Got smokiing room, can't change it and need to wait for the next morning! Unsatisfied!
Do not get the Monaco suite!! Total rip off,  it's not a suite, just a big room. The room was dirty and had old coffee still in the coffee maker. We where in the room for about 4 hours before we couldn't take it anymore and complained. The ONLY reason I am giving three stars is because they have us a free upgrade to the diamond suite! That room is AMAZING. Very satisfied with that. However that's a very expensive room, had we not gotten the upgrade we couldn't have afforded it. . .          The pool, lazy river and wave pool are supper gross and small. The water is a milky color, and they are all wayyy small. Lame. . .       Over all the hotels carpets where dirty...room service is NOT 24 hours and it's supper overpriced! $100 for breakfast for 2 and it took an hours to show up. . . Had we not be givin the free upgrade we would have left on the first night. Only plus $5 black jack! I will not stay at this hotel agian.
We absolutely loved the hotel! Having already stayed at other high end resorts for example the Aria, the Monte Carlo is an affordable, comfortable, luxurious and fun hotel! We loved everything about the hotel! Right down stairs is a Starbucks and mcdonalds, so everything was at close range! During the week it's more family oriented rather than weekends, but nothing too crazy! I really enjoyed my stay here! The pools are the best part! They have a river, wave pool, regular pool and a jacuzzi! There's many areas to layout, but I recommend to go early when the pool opens to save a spot!
Even though their rates are lower than most, I do not think it is worth it. Pay maybe $20 more to stay at Bellagio or another hotel that is newer and cleaner. Monte Carlo is old; the rooms are really average; casino is mediocre. They do have the buffet and M life, so it's ok if you're going for free.  Don't spend your money here.
I've stayed at the MC a few times before and it's always been a pretty nice hotel but this last experience I had in late June was kinda disappointing and I'm not sure I'd go back again, at least not til some things change. . . It started with a ridiculously long wait to check in --over 40 mins on a Wednesday? Really? I could see this kind of a wait on the weekend or a Friday night but this took me by surprise as I've never waited this long mid-week. The irritating part was there were clerks at their stations who just weren't calling people. I supposed they could've been working on some other issue but then don't stand there and make it look like you have all these clerks working when only two are actually checking people in. :( . . My other major disappointment with the MC was that they closed the pool at 4PM for a PRIVATE event. Really? During the summer when it's 100+ degrees and your guests want to stay by the pool most of the day, you close the pool that is supposed to be for ALL guest for a private event? Keep in mind, they charge us a resort fee for all the amenities including the pool and yet, we can't use it because they're making money off it for a private event. I think at the minimum they should've refunded our resort fee on the day they closed the pool but no such offer was made at check-out. . . I go to Vegas quite often and there are many other options in Vegas to not get better service. Hopefully they will improve in the future.
This review is purely for the room I was assigned to (not for the hotel lobby/casino which is nice, clean, standard for a the Vegas strip hotel). The room was nothing to sing songs about. I was ignored when I asked if there wasany room available that was at a higher floor & maybe with a bit of a view (I don't expect strip views and hot tub, but I do expect a little bit of effort when someone asks for anything... especially when paying Vegas strip rices). They proceeded to simply give me what come up on their computers, with no efforts in looking for availability for something a bit better. OK, fine. Now now I'm in my room. There is no wifi at all. I am right above the air conditioning units. Over the parking lot area, out back.  Since the room is hidden out back and at the lowest level of all, I only get EDGE on my phone (which is good for pretty much nothing, not even phone calls).  I found and old and used coffee package dried up and gross in the coffee machine in the morning. There was no hair drier (isn't this a standard even for a non-baller room??). Needless to say, the room was not good. It served it's purpose, which is to give me a place to sleep with a nice kind sized bed, but that's all. For the price? I would not stay there again. Certainly not in that wing / floor / room specifically. Again... the lobby is nice and big and bright and clean. It's a historic hotel (one of the originals!) so it's beautiful with it's chandeliers, for sure ;) Thanks for reading!
This place is falling apart! We wanted to end our trip with relaxation but the room was filthy and old. In the hall the wall paper was falling off. We wanted to try it out because they had the lazy river and the wave pool. There were no waves and the water was cloudy. The only nice person who worked there was the person who checked us in and the guy you get the towels from at the pool. The people walking around there were rude and housekeeping was a joke! I asked for two clean sheets and two blankets and all they brought up was one blanket and the guy was rude. And don't expect enthusiastic dealers. My husband did some sports bets and sat a couple of tables and said all the dealers had the same crappy attitude. The walls are super thin as well so don't expect to get good sleep if your neighbors are up late. As soon as I woke up I got our kids ready and we booked it to the Mandalay bay. I was not about to end my vacation at some run down hotel with miserable workers. Don't expect anything great at this place! And if you complain when you check out all they say is sorry...how about getting a manager. Happy to be checked out some where else with my family. When all of the charges went through they charged me twice and every time I call someone tells me their computer system is down. Guess I'll just have to call my credit card company since they are trying to scam me out of money. Terrible place!! It's still a nightmare and I'm not even there anymore :/
