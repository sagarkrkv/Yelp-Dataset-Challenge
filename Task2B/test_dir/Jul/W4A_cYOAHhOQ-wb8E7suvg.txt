the best show i have ever seen. (i have seen pretty much everything)
This performance was on par I think to  Michael Jackson's Cirque show and much more artsy. I like the small venue and the Greek Theatre layout as well.
Disclaimer: I saw this show after a few drinks. I rate this 4.5 stars. . . Because of the few drinks I had, I was slightly sleepy so perhaps I wasn't as "observant" as I could have been, but this show was really great in every aspect. It was candy to the senses and I felt my sight was overstimulated during and after the show. . . I know this is a weird critique, but I felt that there was so many amazing things going on at such a fast pace, the viewer isn't able to soak and process all the amazing sights. There's so much happening at the same time, I felt that it often didn't have a central point at which your attention is asked to focus to. I believe the show should have a few slower patches of pace, maybe a bit more finesse in overall viewing. . . You can't really mention Le Reve without mentioning O at Bellagio, or at least drawing some comparisons. While I loved the theater at the Wynn and where Le Reve is (It's circular and very nice), I enjoyed both. I just felt O had more of a story perhaps, while Le Reve is more decadent.. . My favorite Cirque show will still have to be Ka, which I've seen 4 time throughout the years. . . Usually, everything Wynn and Encore is superb, and this show is no different. And while I'd consider this show superb and recommend it highly, it also didn't hit the spot like KA did for me. Perhaps it was the alcohol, but if I had the choice I would opt to see KA over Le Reve.
Le re've - the dream... A dream indeed.  . . My husband set up this incredible evening with VIP seats.  They have plush seats that are at the top of the circular stage.  Waitresses come by for drink and snack orders.  There is also a small video screen by your feet to watch behind the scenes before and during the show.  Very interesting! . . As for the show, performers are so talented! The visual display of lighting and water are amazing.  It's not a cirque show so not as many acrobatics but it's still enjoyment! Compared to the other water show in Vegas, I'd probably choose le re've.  . . In this beautiful theater, any seat is great.  We certainly enjoyed this amazing show!
One word BORING!!!! This can't be the best show in Vegas! I had more fun watching the Ringling Bros. Circus!! Seriously save your money on a better show!
The theatre is the main attraction in my opinion. I've seen the show twice and I would have to say that women seem to really like the show. I liked the diving performance the best out of everything that I witnessed but a few other things were impressive. The seating is great compared to most venues in town and overall it's hard to say that you would dislike the show overall. I sat in the VIP seats the first time and on the second row in the splash zone the second time. The VIP seats are great but the video screen that shows you what is going on under the water during the performance actually takes away from watching the show. Maybe that was just me but I wouldn't recommend it.  It's hard not to look at the screen while the show is going on. No bad seats in the theatre and I actually liked the splash zone seats more than VIP. This a great show to take your wife out in las vegas. They will like it.
This was the first show I had ever seen in Vegas and I would definitely go back! Fun story, great athleticism, amazing. Go see this show!
What can I say, I really enjoyed this show. It was very impressive. Wasn't too sure what to expect since it is not  affiliated with "Cirque du Soleil" and that is the brand everybody has heard of. This show has it all: beautiful set, incredible performers, and all the music was performed live. Some of the acrobatics in this show are beyond belief. I also love the fact that it is water based and there is a lot of diving and such. There was one point where somebody dropped all the way from the top of the auditorium into the pool below, had to be at least 100 ft, awesome! I liked how diverse the show was. Water is featured but there lots of suspended mid air acrobatics, dancing and even a good use of magic/illusions. The lighting effects in the theatre really added to the experience. . . The theater is really nice and I don't think their is a bad seat in the house. I am glad I was sitting in a mid level row. I don't think my neck would be happy sitting in the front row and having to look straight up into the air for half the show.. . The wife and I had this show comped as part of our stay at The Wynn.  I saw the prices though and I believe they are probably a lil higher than what we have paid at other shows on the strip.. . Le Reve is very entertaining so check it out next time you are in Vegas.
