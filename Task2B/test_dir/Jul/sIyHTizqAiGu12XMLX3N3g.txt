the food here is awesome. its 30$ for lunch if you want to wait 2 hours, its 50$ if you go to the express line.  Its 50$ without additional 20$ express fee after 3pm.  THE SERVICE HERE SUCKS.  we had this lady who rung us up and she absolutely didnt know what the hell she was doing.  We wanted split tabs and we were a party of 6.  She charged us gratuity when she wasnt suppose to and we ended up all standing in front of her for a dam near 15 minutes while she and her manager discussed the problem eventually being moved to another lady to complete our process.  Our waiter or buser said there wasnt unlimited mimosa.... which was a lie.. and we basically stacked our own plates left it on the floor cause she obviously didnt give a dam.  . . . BESIDES THIS THE FOOD IS GOOD! taco sstation, seafood station, pizza, etc etc but the food was legitimately good! and the dessert section was great! my gf loved that part
Overrated, over priced and over hyped.. . After a three year hiatus from Vegas and studying a variety of reviews, articles, status updates, tweets, and listening to chatter from those who enjoyed this majestic buffet I left unimpressed. Sure it looks cool, but I'm not paying for an architectural tour. . . Price point wise it's the highest. It's not top shelf quality and execution. This distinction belongs to Wynn, Wicked Spoon and even Bellagio. It might be worth it if they bring their price down. Additionally, it cost me $26.95 for my four year old.. . When I think of any buffet I'm always partial to the carving station. To me, this is fundamental component of every good buffet. It's like when I test a great ice cream place I'm not falling for the gimmicks, bells, and whistles. I want to know how your vanilla tastes like. If it's a wedding, I don't care about your photo booth, how was your wedding cake. Well, this carving station fell short. Real short. The prime rib was extremely dry. Lacked salt and any kind of savory flavor. I even asked for an edge piece and it still lacked any depth. The brisket was a little better, but also dry too. The ribs were the best, good smoke ring.. . Maybe if they didn't bother with the meat and cheese spread they could have put more effort in their "American" station. The Mexican station was also disappointing. The carnitas were very dry. The agua frescas were the only redeeming parts of that station.. . The Asian stations, the desserts and the seafood station were probably it's best features, but for a bay area native I was not lured by their Asian offerings. If I wanted seafood I would have somewhere else. If they had a dessert buffet option price I would reconsider returning..  . Quality, not quantity is what's lacking. I won't be endorsing it unless you have money to throw away or want to spend most of your time at the dessert station.
This buffet is amazing. SO many choices you don't even know what to eat first. The only thing I wanted to comment about was that the crab claws were not cracked well enough so it was something that was hard to eat. The dim sum was okay with real chinese chefs, fresh tacos were delicious, prime rib excellent and a fabulous selection of carbs. The deserts were the BEST! The cake pops were EXCELLENT! Definitely worth the price.
Went for dinner, and it was nothing exciting, nothing amazing. Pretty disappointed for a $60 meal. How did I get so many recommendations for this!? Went on a Saturday and they said they would call us back in 2 hours. They get your number to text you when they are ready which is nice so you can go explore. We went to the forum shops to kill time and they ended up texting us to come back in a little over an hour so it wasn't bad. . . The stations: seafood, meat, Mexican, Italian, bread, Asian, salads, desserts.. . I couldn't find anything I wanted to get seconds of! So sad. Well I would actually have gotten seconds of the crepe if I wasn't so full. But that's it, nothing else stood out, and the crepe only stood out because you can't mess up Nutella. Bahh, I spent $60 on whatever food, should have stopped walking when I hit Nobu.. . Crab legs were good, I liked cold better than the hot ones which they serve at the Italian station. There is NO line for the hot ones. I repeat NO LINE for HOT CRAB legs, so go there first if you only want them hot. The only line I had to wait in was for the seafood station and it takes a while because everyone is filling their plates with crab legs and oysters to get their $'s worth. . . Overall not as many choices as I thought. Not even good quality. Meat was dry, seafood was low quality, Italian station pizza was horrible, sushi did not look exciting, dumplings weren't bad, bread was hard, didn't even try the Mexican station because it was so regular. All in all, nothing exciting. I looked back at the pictures and they looked more fun and exciting before, maybe it went downhill?. . Dessert station looked so pretty. Too bad I tried ALL of them and only liked the Oreo mousse and the crepe. Waited 8 minutes for the Chocolate Souffle, which you ask them to make, and it tasted like powdered fake chocolate, like the ones used for hot chocolate, so gross!!! Cake pop look a likes were gross, the peanut butter cone things were so cute, but the cone was stale. Gelato wasn't so bad so definitely try that. So sad, I have such a big sweet tooth I thought I'd be in heaven. I was so disappointed with every bite.. . My whole group was actually disappointed and they love buffets.  . . If you like good quality food, don't do this. If you like tons of options and endless eating with mediocre food you'll probably be happy. I'm more of a person that would rather have an entree and dessert that blows my mind, than 10 entrees and desserts that are very forgetful. This is more of a bunch of unlimited 2-3 star food.
My friends and I were making a trip to Vegas from the bay area. When it comes to buffets over here, we only have mediocre places like hometown buffet or asian buffets such as Tomi, which used to be Todai. Bleh. After asking my friends for a recommendation of where to eat, many suggest Bacchanal and I am SO glad that my group and I settled for Bacchanal. The food is outstanding and everything is high quality. It is a bit pricy. For a week day dinner, it was$55 including tax, but I still think my meal was worth it taking that most of the things I ate was seafood. :) There was seriously so much variety and different kinds of foods. There was also a meat area where they served sausages and meatballs and I could definitely tell that it was high quality and fresh. . The first thing I want to do when I get back to Vegas is go to Bacchanal. o:)
Dinner buffet. The food look old. Crab legs and carving station look like some 9.99 buffets. Dinner is 50.99. But I would not eat here if the price was 20 bucks. I was smart enough to ask them to let me check out the food first. 5 stars for me.
3rd time visit:. . going downhill!!  but the price is still the same or increased.. . The price, is still the same.. . The wait, has changed. You now have to pre-check in at the kiosk then it'll print out a little receipt where it tells you what time to go back to the podium to check in and then wait in line to pay. . . We got there at 4:45 expecting a long wait.. but instead we had to do the kiosk thing and ended up eating at 7pm instead and we were in a time crunch since we had a show at 9:30pm. If we had known this early, we wouldn't have been so rushed. Anyway, so i'm giving you a heads up now.. . on to the food. same selection but less. looks like they cut down on the desserts. back in january i remember being able to select from 4 to 5 different mochi flavors, this time, just two. There were more ice cream / sorbets back in january, now there were only less than one row of ice cream selection... the other row was DISPLAY ONLY.. . the crab legs were alright. still not as meaty, however, it is better than the first time i've visited. The stone crab claws were not good - no taste. If i'm paying over $50 for buffet, i expect better quality seafood. Those crab legs need to be upgraded to fatter ones. Those skinny legs are not acceptable. I can get those crab legs at a different buffet for a much lesser price.. . their turn around time for plates were slow this time. There were times when there were no plates at all in almost all of the stations. . . i must say that this 3rd visit, was a let down. Most of the time i was just walking around thinking what I should get to eat. Nothing really stood out this time (except for their miso glazed sea bass).. . i'm not sure if i'll be visiting bacchanal again if they continue with this quality of food. It just wasn't as good as when they first started. If that's the case, i rather spend less money at a different buffet and eat mediocre food. why pay so much and also get [slightly above] mediocre food?
Sometimes the wait for a table can be a turn off, but whenever you do get the chance to get in, it's like you're walking into the gates of heaven. This is definitely my favorite buffet in Vegas. I visited twice my last trip, once for dinner, and once for lunch. Prices are about $55 before tax and tip for dinner and $35 before tax and tip for lunch. . . They have a bunch of different stations to pick your food from like, Asian, Italian, Mexican, American, Meats/Poultry, Seafood, and in the middle of the dining area is a huge dessert station. . . The foods that shined for me were the lamb chops, prime rib, and snow crab legs! All three of these items will make the money you're spending worth it since you'll probably go back for seconds or thirds of each! However, they only have prime rib out of the three during lunch. My boyfriend and friends really enjoyed their street style tacos as well! . . The dessert table has so many different options from creme brulee, build your own crepes, cake pops, cupcakes, much more! Definitely give the creme brulee a try! . . Service here is really good as well. They're always refilling drinks and cleaning off dirty plates fairly quickly. You usually don't even have to ask for a refill and that's a big plus in my eyes. . . This place is definitely worth trying if you're ever in Vegas! Wait out the line, and splurge a little! :)
A little bit overrated and priced for what they offer. . Liked the risotto and fresh cut salami and some desserts the best.. A lot of choices tough and even have real Italian gelato.. Only a couple of bad things: bread was very hard as it had been there since morning and the cold cut Mortadella was defrosted before being sliced.
The food was very good. We came around 10am when it was empty. The variety of food  was well developed. Definitely worth the price. Mimosas are the added benefit!
I think one of the best if not the best buffets in Las Vegas.  Talk about ginormous selection!  There's a seafood station with crab legs, shrimp, ceviche, oyster shooters, miso sea bass, lobster biscuits, a whole meat station with sausage, prime rib, brisket, ham and chicken, a mexican station, a whole other room that has asian food including dim sum, roast duck, chow mein and fried rice, sushi, and cold meats and cheeses, and an italian station with pizza.  Then you have dessert with a made to order crepe station, gelato, ice cream, and various desserts.  Definitely have to pace yourself so you can try a little bit of everything.  I really think this is one of the buffets in Las Vegas that has the most variety and everything was pretty tasty considering it was a buffet!  July 4th brunch was $53 a person so it's not cheap but definitely worth a visit.  Wait wasn't too long for 3...came at around 10:30.  You check in electronically and they will text you when it's ready.
The wait is quite long; however the food is worth it.  They also hike up the prices during holiday weekends.  The select is remarkable, and the food is served fresh.  It is one of the best buffet around.  If the wait was not so long, it would give it more stars.  But as I stated before, the food is well worth it.
One if the best buffet I've been to so far. Almost can't say anything bad about this place. They food is quality and has a nice fancy feel. The place is huge and can seat a lot of people so even if the line looks long it might not be a long wait.
For the price we paid for, like $65 per person (went on July 4), I'd assume that we'd get fed gourmet dishes and free beer. Didn't realize that you'd still have to pay for the beer, I was kind of sad about that haha. . . Let's start with the pros. The dessert station was like a candy land. It was HUGE. My eyes lit up when I saw the gelato station (or ice cream, I have no idea), cake pops, cheesecakes, pies, oh my so much more. A lot of variety in dessert. My favorites were the ice cream/gelato, cheesecake and the cupcakes. The cupcakes were especially cute and decorated well :D I tried the macaron but it was a bit too sweet for me. I was excited with the cake pops, but.... It jut didn't have he right taste or feel..... To it. . . Next let's talk stations. They have a good variety of Asian, Mexican, seafood, Italian, american, salad and bread/cheese.. . The "dim sum" was too dry for me. The noodles were bland to me too. The Italian pizza was too sweet (weird right?) and the meatball had a weird texture to it. . . The salad was fresh. However the meat was dry for me. . . Let's talk service now. The cashier that rang us up was sassy and didn't really know what was going on. She told us to go back to the woman at the line even though it was obvious that we already went through her and was sent over to the cash registers.... The waitresses were nice and attentive to us, which was good. . . Overall, if we paid $30 I would be satisfied with the experience, but knowing that this is a 4 star and $65, my expectations were higher.
Overcrowded, but well worth the wait. You get what you pay for and this place is worth every cent.
Update:  They implemented a new way to check into the buffet.  There's 4 touchscreen computers for you to enter your party size.  You'll receive a ticket which indicates what time you will need to come back to the hostess line (the one on the left with the pretty hostess).. . EG: 4th of July Saturday, I grabbed my ticket at 410pm.  Ticket says come back at 5:55pm.  I was texted at 515pm to start lining up at the hostess line.  About 6pm is when I will make it to the front (I'm writing this as I wait in line).
let me sart by saying WAY over priced buffet. its good food but not great for $31 pp for lunch. WOW.  the tacos were good, crapes great, fruit not ripe, sald bar a joke. seafood station never stocked up, with 4 cooks back there,  the chiplote clams were good, but most of the calms were not open. I will not be ever going back there, there are better buffets for  locals in Vegas.
A very impressive buffet with everything you can want and more. The buffet options are not typical buffet quality... they are higher than average for sure. Each genre of food is good enough for you to just enjoy that one for the entire meal. Plan on being a while if you want to enjoy and sample the various options.
Tried this buffet today and mannn was it expensive! It was $53 per person because it was Fourth of July weekend. I highly recommend signing up for the total rewards card which will give you  discount on all the restaurants and shops inside the hotel and other sister hotels. It's completely free and you can accumulate points. It was $49 person after the discount. I was really disappointed because it was not that great, especially for the price! Food was mediocre and the selection was not that great. I like the wicked spoon at Cosmo a lot more. However I did love the virtual line system they have. They text you when your table is ready so you don't have to wait in a long line. You can lose more money in the casino in the mean time ;). I also saw singer Miguel at the buffet! Made my day! Even famous people like eating at the Vegas buffets :)
First time I tried.  It was awesome. But this time it is actually not good.  They also increase the price for 4th July holiday. But the food was worse. Oysters were not fresh. King crabs are small.  We were really disappointed. For almost $70 a person. Totally not worth it. Stay away for good.
This Buffet is a 1.5 , I refuse to give it a 2. The service is always great. They got the decent crab legs and ribs. Everything else goes down hill from there. Craw fish has no taste (anyone can cook better!), you can have better string beans in a carryout restaurant than the ones here which taste almost rotten, sushi bar sushi is simply salmon and tuna, an $8 all you can eat local buffet has more sushi selection, and makes much better sushi. Don't get me wrong, this buffet is extremely busy and popular, and just because of that, even when the quality is poor, they will always have the demend. I waited 5 minutes in the Vipline, I can't picture myself to  wait more than 15 minutes in the regular line for this. Its just not worth it. If you want buffet, Planet Hollywood buffet has better tasting food. Also try Todoi Seafood buffet, it's many times better.
I didn't expect there to be an hour wait on a Sunday night around 9!. It was also still 4th of July pricing so it was 60.99/person. . We ended up only waiting about 30 min to wait in line to get seated. . Food was good especially the steamed crab legs.. They have a wide variety of food and desserts. . I was expected for the desserts but was a little disappointed when I tried them. . The nutella crunch gelato on a cone was really good. I had 2. :). Service was good.
Thinking of going to buffet at Caesars Palace? Make sure you check in at least 4 hours ahead. I checked in around 7pm and waiting time was 270 minutes. (See my photo). I eventually checked in early with vip access pass. Regular buffet price is approximately $60 per person. My suggestion? Its not worth it. Food was good as any other restaurant with half the price. I give C- for service. Once was good enough. I have no plans for next visit.
The one buffet in Vegas that you really need to go to is Bacchanal!! . . By far the best buffet I have ever been to, ever! This place is amazing, it has such a variety of food and the quality is amazing. . . It hasa very modern look to it and is massive. . . It is pricey at like $50 or $60 per person and the wait is long, but totally worth it =] To get your moneys worth, you need to eat at least 5 plates minimum, not including dessert or crab legs!!. . Everything tastes amazing and fresh and just delicious. I just can't say anything bad about this place. I can't wait to come back again and stuff my face with all this yummy goodness!!
For years we had gone to Wicked Spoon cause quite frankly, we have never walked out disappointed. . . Prior to my last trip to Vegas, I scoured Yelp for Vegas Must Eats and although my heart was set on another Wicked visit, the reviews for Baccahanal compelled me to switch it up. . . As expected, the wait was long at about 6PM and the staff moved the line as efficiently as they could. For an extra $20, you can bypass the wait, but considering the buffet was already $50++ , we opted to starve just a little bit longer.  What I do like is that you check in, and they give you a time slot to return, and even shoot you a text, so that you arent in line for the 60+ minutes.. . Once inside, we walked straight to the buffet lines and their selection was very impressive. All sorts of fou fou, rustic, traditional, new american type for as far as the eye can see and nose can smell.  On my first run, I had two plates heaping with food, and everything from the meat carving station of course. . . To my disappointment, however, they didn't offer the infamous rib eye. I was moreso saddened by its unavailability since my friends and reviews had it built up so much in my head. Nonetheless, they offered tri tip, ribs, lamb and prime rib. . . I had a little bit of everything, and although nothing stood out to me as stellar, everything I ate was pretty good. . . Love their dessert station too. Their options are abundantly confusing although their ice cream didn't come close to Wicked's in texture. Weird I know. Overall though, I nearly tried every single item in that station and was impressed.. . Definitely glad I stepped out of my Wicked comfort zone since we all left happy and painfully plump.
I went exactly at 8:00AM on a Saturday morning to avoid the lines. My boyfriend had raved about this place, and I was REALLY looking forward to this since I love brunch and breakfast foods. I was pretty disappointed. The selection was definitely overwhelming which I appreciated. I was really excited for the crab claws, lobster eggs Benedict, and a Mexican-inspired dish with a tortilla, egg, and chorizo. The lobster claw, when I bit into it, was FROZEN. I literally bit into it, and water filled my mouth, and I almost gagged. The lobster eggs Benedict was lukewarm, even though I was one of the first people to grab one. And the chorizo disk was sub-par. . . I did however really enjoy the waffles. I must have eaten 5 of them, I enjoyed them so much. The sweet potato tots were also quite tasty. The rest of the breakfast fare was fine enough. I definitely do not think it was worth the high price tag, however.
What a great new buffet the Bellagio open last year 2013. This place look very fancy front the outside and on the inside. When you go inside the buffet line they have many variety station from seafood, Mexican, American, and Asian. For seafood they served crab legs, shrimps, oysters, crawfish, salmon, etc. for the other stand out station American had steak, Mexcian had tacos, and Asian had sushi, noodles, and some dim sum dishes. The desert station was so amazing that it has everything single desert you can think of from ice cream, to specialty cakes, to snow flake ice cream. I sure def made my $50 worth especially hitting up the crab legs multiple times. Make it count!
The good news is that they have kept their quality high and added gelato to the dessert buffet. I think there were six flavors. . . The bad news is that their prices got a bit higher. Guess quality has to be paid for, does not come free. . . Will continue with the four star rating. I think Bellagio and Mandalay Bay are better values for the money.
Fantastic place. All kinds of options. Long lines on the good stuff. So when your looking to see what looks the best I would recommend just follow the line of people.  . . Great past and seafood options. Service is great the staff takes pride in what they do. . . Desert time is always my favorite. And here the little pies and stuff topped off the meal well
My brothers and I are dinner around 630 pm after registering for a ticket to wait in line for the buffet. (Note: there's two steps to get into the buffet; (1) enter contact and party info into kiosk and wait for a buzz on your phone or whatever way of contact and (2) get your ticket marked by worker and then wait in line pay and then wait again until your table is open.) I believe this process took 2 hours on a holiday weekend.. . The food overall was just about the same since last time although they didn't have black chicken soup that enjoyed last time. I recommend trying the various juices such as pineapple, strawberry, and hibiscus. There juices were natural light, refreshing, and not too sweet. One item I really enjoyed was the miso sea bass in the seafood section. It was hot, flaky, and deliciously full of flavor. I actually went back immediately for another portion. Another item I liked was in the dessert section; a light fluffy tropical cake was one my favorite dessert. I recommend drinking tea with this dessert.. . As usual, the food tasted great but was pretty expensive. I wished I had the stomach of Joey Chestnut so that I can truly earn my money's worth but realistically we all know that is impossible.. . Be prepared everyone...be very prepared so that you can sample everything on the menu.
Third time eating at this buffet mecca this past 4th of July weekend. This buffet embodies the word massive (in food selection, gluttony, and flavor) so if you are only going to eat at one buffet in Vegas, this is the one to try.. . Wait: They recently installed a kiosk system, giving you a time when your table will be ready. If you choose to go this route (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), it frees you up to go gamble, relax, or putting on loose fitting clothes. This new system erased my previous main gripe about this place - the lines.. . Price: This is one of Vegas' most expensive buffets, so be prepared to pay $35/person for lunch and $45 for dinner ($50 on the weekends). For those doing the 24-hour Buffet of Buffets, it is a $15 charge per trip, per person to eat here. For best bang-for-your buck, aim for a 2 - 3 PM arrival, so you can catch some of the dinner foods at a lunch price. This place, as with most other Vegas buffets, will charge you extra on holidays and their corresponding weekends (Memorial, 4th of July, Labor, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years are the ones I remember them mentioning).. . Food Highlights:. You really can't go wrong with anything here. This is a rarity for buffets, which I have found to be largely "meh" with a few sprinkled good dishes. It WILL take multiple trips and many hours to explore their vast selection. Here are my favorites:. - The Seafood section, which includes selections such as snow and steamed crabs, fresh oysters, and various seafood concoctions are a must try, as are the many selections at the carving station. Quality is much higher than those at other buffets.. - The TACO STATION is delicious! I love Mexican food and these were taco truck at 3 AM good!. - Your Asian and American foods are definitely a cut above others in terms of quality. I did find some of the foods to be on the salty side, however.. - The fresh squeezed juices (I believe 5 different kinds) are unique to this buffet. We came on a Sunday, so we were also able to take advantage of mimosas at no extra charge.. - The desserts here are the best in Vegas, no comparison. Tiramisu, creme brulee, macarons, and mochi ice cream are some of the more gourmet desserts that make this the highlight station.. . Overall:  This buffet's selection and quality is definitely a cut above the others that I have recently tried. The dessert station here itself is worth the price of admission and makes this place worth checking out. I'm not sure if it's worth the holiday pricing, but it is worth the regular prices or the $15 Buffet of Buffets add-on. If you only have the time, budget, or stomach space for one buffet, make it Bacchanal, the God of Buffets.
This used to be my favorite but not anymore. I went on July 4th weekday dinner and I was disappointed in the lack of culinary selections. The dessert section is fabulous, atmosphere is great, staff is friendly and attentive. But the food (and price) aren't worth it anymore. Who knows maybe they were having a bad day but I'm not going to pay $50 to find out again.
Now this is a world class buffet! I'm a big buffet lover so we made a beeline for this after hearing the rave reviews. We went on a Friday afternoon for lunch, around 2PM I think, and we only had to wait in-line for maybe 10 minutes. The restaurant is absolutely gigantic, and they have the biggest selection of food at a Vegas buffet. All of the stations are in a row at one side of the buffet, and you could easly just walk through the entire thing at once, but I personally prefer working station by station. . . We startet at the Asian station, and they had a vast selection, and I have to say that everything I tried was absolutely delicious! Next was the Italian station which was a bit smaller, with a selection of pasta and pizza. Moving on to the Mexican station, where you have a selection of toppings/sides, and a person frying up the meat you want in a burrito wrap. Not to mention, as many as you want! Second to last was the American/BBQ station, which I think was the biggest one. There was a carving station with a selection of warm meats, and the brisket was just beyond yummy! You can also choose any type of potato your heart desires, and then there's the selection of small, random things, like delicious sliders and sweet corn. The last station (or first, depends on where you start) is the seafood station. We didn't get anything there, but the station was very inviting and it looked like they hadtons of fresh picks for the seafood and shellfish lover. In the middle of the room you find a big dessert station that you can walk around completly. In all honesty, I was a bit dissapointed. I'm a big chocolate lover, and they only had a few chocolate picks. I actually had a little sugarfree sticky cake type thing, and I would have never known it was sugarfree. They also have tons of ice cream, and they'll make you a cone with the flavours you want.. . Now, the staff. I think I would say that this is the least friendly staff we found at a strip establishment on this trip. They weren't rude or anything, but it seemed like most of them hated their jobs and didn't try to hide it. It's probably a pretty crappy place to work with all the guests that come through, but still. . . One thing I would recommend is that if you like a certain station, get smaller portions and then come back later in your meal. They change up the selection all the time, and when they're out of one dish they replace it with something else (atleast in the dessert and grill stations). It may seem obvious if you think of the fact that they serve about 500 dishes every day, but we didn't really think it through and saw lots of exciting dishes that we hadn't tried on the way out. . . The room is very airy and spacious, and there are glass walls out towards the pool and the garden.. . All in all I think this may be my favorite Vegas buffet. I'm not sure it's the best tasting food (I think I'll have to go with the Wynn buffet on that one), but the sheer selection makes it incredible. Will definetly be coming back!. . I recommend coming for lunch, and on a weekday. We walked past Saturday night, and the lines were insane. Everything is also cheaper on the weekdays, and I think we paid about 35 USD pp for lunch, and I think it's 10-15 USD more on the weekend.
The buffet gives you much variety of food to choose from thr only downside is the food could be warmer.
Raises the standard for Vegas buffets. We were big fans of the Wynn and Bellagio buffets and visited Bacchannal and Wicked Spoon on our most recent trip. . . What really impressed us was the service we had. We had a gentleman by the name of Miguel and he was absolutely outstanding and similar to service at more traditional "fancy"  sit down restaurants.  We did not have to ask for things he just made it "happen" so to speak like he was reading our minds.. . Some highlights included:  Crab Won tons, prime rib and the scalloped potatoes.. . Comparison vs Wicked Spoon. . Pros: Has a wider variety of food. The number of food stations here is absolutely amazing. They even had a Taquero and Horchata which was funny for this California Hispanic boy. . . About the Same: The quality of food. They both had cracked snow crab legs which are always popular. The both had some different options but for the most part everything was "good" to "very good". The dessert options were both about the same as well. . . Negatives: Long Lines, and it's a little more expensive than the other buffets but given the service and variety I think it's reasonable.. . Also the Horchata was not cold enough and the Churros at the dessert bar were not kept "warm " enough .
Best buffet in Las Vegas? If I was going to pay $51.99 for dinner, then it better be!. . We checked in at a kiosk when we arrived. At the kiosk, you enter the number of people in your partyand a phone number. It tells you the estimated time it'll take to get a table and you'll receive a text informing you when to return rather than staying in line the whole time. After some hassle I'd rather not get into, we finally got seated. The interior was decorated nicely and is divided into three dining rooms- glass, wood, and steel. . . All of us headed to the seafood section first. It had shrimp, oysters, and most importantly snow crab legs. I loved how they were cut down the middle lengthwise. It made it easy to pick the meat out. If not, I wouldn't have bothered eating crab- too much work. They have heated snow crab in the Italian section as well.. . There were a variety of stations besides seafood including: Chinese, Japanese, American, Italian, Mexican, meat carving, charcuterie and cheese, etc.  A few of those stations were located in the back room. There is a whole separate section devoted to desserts too. The desserts were hit or miss. I loved the green tea creme brulee, while I didn't like the texture of the overly sweet macarons. There are made-to order crepes too. . . I didn't try everything I wanted to. I should've mapped out a better strategy. In the end, I felt like I could've eaten much more than I did. I was full, but not $51.99 full.
Sadly, the quality at Bacchanal has dwindled since it started. The biggest hit is supposed to be the fresh oysters, but they were nasty as hell when I went. . . However, the best seafood dish would be the hot crab legs! Don't even have to wait in a line AND you're given a FULL plate! Best thing in the whole buffet!. . Also, the juices! No, I don't mean the juices offered by the waiters. I'm talking about the ones at the station: guava, pineapple, horchata (not a juice but w/e), etc. These are soooo good, and you definitely can't find these at other places.. . The copious amounts of desserts are also not to be messed with. So many choices of gelato are available! They even added shaved ice (hawaiian ice style) to the mix as well with toppings such as red beans, popping boba, and mochi. . . Overall, the food and selection is great! But, the quality is not as good as when it first started.
This buffet is too darn big to write a detailed review. Is it expensive? Yes. But did you expect any less than $50 a person in Vegas anyway? Luckily, my boyfriend and I chose to go on a weekday, so there was no wait. It was basically like we had the buffet to ourselves which was awesome. . . We arrived at the perfect time. Breakfast was ending and lunch was starting. The seating area is fancy and they give you little rubber plate holders :) I love souvenirs. . . They break it down by sections, obviously. First was seafood/breakfast seafood (lobster benedict, etc.) then a bunch of different meats (steaks, sausages, etc.) then after that I just don't remember specifically. Like I said, this buffet is huge. . . I was disappointed at first. I was like, this is it? My boyfriend came back with a slider (my favorite food in the world) and I was like, "Where did you get that?" --He said, "You didn't turn the corner, did you?" No, no I did not. . . But when I did, there's cheeses, breads, italian food, asian food, FRESH SUSHI!!, and a DIY ramen station. OMG this place. . . I would definitely come back. The table service is amazing, my water was never empty. Plates were always cleared quickly. WIN. . . Bacchanal : 1 , Janelle: 0
Long lines! Pay extra and ditch the line
Use to go to the Wynn Buffet. Now I am going both. I woudn't be able to choose which one is the best. Food is excellent and various. LOVE IT
Let's call this place for what it really is, honestly a little overhyped.  Yes, the oysters are all you can eat, but I can hardly bring myself to call those dry morsels "oysters".  I tried to taste as many different items as I could, but went HAM on the oysters and crab legs, a trait instilled in me by my frugal Asian heritage.. . Although I am very salty about the oysters, the crab legs were, well, crab legs.  I like to get a small cup of melted butter and amass a huge collection of crab meat, then mix the concoction and gorge on my delectable creation.. . Other great contenders were the Potatoes with truffle shavings, and lobster soup.  The desserts were also plentiful and tasty, but dear lord in heaven what the hell are those things they call Macaroons?. . Tasteless, dry and god awful, these macaroons left a salty taste in my mouth much like Napoleon felt after the Battle of Waterloo.. . I regret not trying out the warm crab legs that were only available upon request at the Italian station.  Also, the sushi sucked, if I'm paying upwards of $60 for this buffet, I think I can damn request some decent sushi.. . All things considered, Bacchanal Buffet IS very impressive, but in my opinion, overhyped for the price they charge.  Aside from some few unique dishes, the overall experience does not live up to the expectations that I feel were set by other respectable reviews.. . That being said, if you have a little extra money to spend or profit a lot from your blackjack winnings in Vegas, do try the Bacchanal Buffet at least once in your life!  I do not think I will be returning anytime soon, for I am just a poor boy and nobody loves me. (He's just a poor boy from a poor family).
Can't really complain about the food.  It's one fo the best buffets I've been to.  Note for those wanting crab legs: there's a long line for the cold crab legs on the seafood bar, but go to the Italian section for hot crab legs.  No line there.
Wow, this restaurant is worth every cent my family and I paid. Everything is so delicious. The food is plentiful and very high quality. It was better than I expected. So many options to satisfy your taste buds with every option being delicious. I highly recommend eating here. Next time I visit the strip I will be back.
Holy crap! There was food everywhere. And good food. I went in for the seafood first. After two heaping plates of crab legs, I was worried I overloaded myself on so much seafood that I wouldn't be able to enjoy the meats. Nope. I was good for another plate from the meat carving station where the prime rib and brisket were aaaawesome. Throughout, I dabbled around in the different areas (Asian, Latin, Italian) for bites of different sides. You know it's a good buffet when you skip the mac-n-cheese! We started at around 8:30pm and closed them down at 10:00pm. Admittedly, it was a little late to eat but actually ended up being perfect since we didn't have to wait in long lines and I could go straight to bed after eating myself into disrepair. . . If you're going to go to a buffet, you might as well make an event of it, and Bacchanal is the perfect place to do just that.
Arguably best buffet in vegas.  Large selection of seafood, sushi and salads.  A bit overpriced but I will return.  Make sure you see all the foods as paet of the buffet is a bit hidden.  If you are not a big seafood fan then you are probably overpaying.
Go earlier so you don't have to wait a long time. . . There such a huge selection here!!! Some is good and some isn't, but there's so many choices to chose from.. . I def ate my money's worth in crab legs. Yum!!! . . I was too full by my 2nd round, I didn't even get to see what else they had. :"(
Best buffet in Vegas! Their selection is huge! Their plating, food presentations are great. Food is excellent!!! I have a sweet tooth so I loved their dessert section. So many choices! The ambience is really nice. Worth every penny!
Pros: lot's of choices. Cons: price. . I have to agree with a lot of other reviewers here on the quality/price vs other Vegas buffets. It's way overpriced. The food selection was pretty awesome and the quality was good, but not enough to make it worth the $. Out of the 3 I've been to so far, The Wynn is the top on my list so far. Went at 4 in the afternoon, and walked right in.
I came in with very high expectations and left unsatisfied. I expected high quality food, but found many dishes to be disappointing. Their chicken for the chicken and waffles and the brisket were slightly on the dry side. There were plenty of other dishes to choose from, but nothing really stood out as amazing. The desserts were pretty impressive, but I didn't get a chance to try a lot of them. . . To be honest, this kind of food might have been acceptable for any buffet, but after waiting 2 and a half hours to get in and paying 50 dollars, I regret going to this buffet more than I regret losing money on the slot machines.
Whack. At 52 dollars a person I would expect better. The line is very long. I had to wait over 2 hours and another 30 minutes to get to the seafood line. The ribs were burnt. The beef brisket was too salty. The shrimps were good. The taco station was good. They make parties with handicapped persons wait in line.  It was not worth the money and especially the time for this place.
We arrived early on Sunday morning to beat the crowd. I am glad we did. . The interior is beautiful. There are three sections: glass, wood and metal. Each area is large and filled with natural sunlight. A nice chAnge from the other buffets around town that are dark, stuffy and filled smoke.. We sat near the dessert section that had array of cookies, cakes and puddings. Nice selections but We were not able to try anything because we ate so much of the other dishes.  . There was a wide range of foods, many u don't see at other places in town.  Such as eggs on top of rib eye, chorizo con papas, hummus, chicken verde, various watermelon, cucumber juice......there were so many different foods I can not do it justice. . There basically two different areas with food.. The staff behind the food was friendly and our waitress was attentive and friendly. . Though the buffet was busy, the noise level was low.. If you want to treat yourself go for it.....the price is a little high but it was well worth the price.
The Bacchanal Buffet was a great experience with my wife and family. We were all in vegas this past weekend and wanted to eat here to celebrate my sister's birthday. I was running late to meet up with my parents and sister and husband. So they waited in line first. They told me that you had to grab a ticket to reserve a time to come back since there was a long wait or you could pay $20 plus the dinner price (around $53) just to not wait the 2 hours and wait in line. So they were waiting in line around 6:15PM on a Saturday. My wife, her parents and I finally met up with my family in front of the buffet. I saw that they had a separate line for the total rewards members; a seven stars, diamond and platinum line and a regular line to wait. This was the first time I got to use my diamond players card to my advantage. There wasn't anyone in the diamond line so I walked right up. The worker called me and we basically just had to pay and walked right into the buffet. No waiting at all! This was the best use of my diamond card and started off the Bacchanal Buffet experience on a good note!. . We were seated right at the front. I believe they seat the higher card holder members in their own area. So there was 8 of us and they gave us a nice 8 person table with a great location next to the seafood kitchen at the front of the buffet. The worker told us all the different kitchens and locations. The buffet is huge! You walk to the back of the buffet and turn the corner and they have 2 other kitchen areas to eat at. . . The asian kitchen had some really good food. They had duck and dim sum and ramen/udon/pho. They also had sushi there and steamed crabs that were really fresh. I got the steamed crabs and the worker was really nice. The steamed crabs are brought out in pots so if they run out they have to make more and you just have to wait or come back for the next batch. They have an american and italian section. The wagyu beef sliders were so good! A definite must try! The meat kitchen had so much good food. They had lamb chops, ribs, prime rib, and other goodness. They had little bottles of juice. The horchata was delicious! The seafood kitchen had oysters, cold crab legs and shrimp and some fish. There was so much food to choose from. I would definitely come back to try out more food as there was way too much good food to choose from. The dessert area had really good desserts as well. They had shave ice with different flavors and topping to put on it. The popping pearls were surprisingly delicious!. . The buffet is decorated really nicely. They have lots of glass decorations everywhere and like a glass wall in the front. The buffet is really open and feels really big. The food selection is great and gives you a lot of choices to cater to different tastes. This is probably my #1 buffet now in vegas. The buffet is pretty pricey though with dinner around $53 a person. But this experience was definitely worth it and the food was excellent!. . If you eat here with someone who is a platinum, diamond or seven stars member, make sure to use the benefits and cut the line!
It's really not worth coming here unless you can eat and enjoy seafood.. . I came here with 3 others, and only 1 of us could indulge freely in seafood. Nearly all the buffet dishes had "too" much of something. Too sweet, too salty, too greasy, too dry. Their pizza was disgustingly salty. How in the world do you fail a dish as basic as pizza? I've had better pizza at my college dining common lol. The thing I enjoyed most was their cold bean salad, which is kind of sad. On the bright side, their seafood is very fresh. I normally steer clear of seafood because it either gives me heartburn or makes me sick to my stomach, but I chanced one raw oyster and I was fine after.  . . Our server had an attitude and deliberately avoided cleaning our table. I'd see him pass by and eye the dishes that need to be taken away, and then walk over to another nearby table instead.. . We came in at 10:30am and got to experience some lunch items at breakfast price. I was super disappointed to hear that the lamb doesn't come out until 3:00pm. But whatever because their prime rib had a tough texture and was salty so I doubt the lamb could be any better. I doubt I would ever come here again unless I'm not the one paying.
Alright, I was super excited to try Baccahanal, but it failed my expectations.  The variety of stuff was ok.  There was really nothing I went back for seconds.  I think the best thing was the tacos.  It was nice to see them making the street tacos the authentic way.  The lines were long for it but they were worth it.  The sushi was ok, not much flavor and it was the same for all the asian section.  The shrimp cocktail was ok .. . The dessert section was nice, and had a lot of variety.  A lot of what I wanted was all gone and I waited a while for them to restock.  I waited maybe 20 minutes and it wasnt restocked yet so I asked one of the gals who was working the dessert section if I could have one since I saw it on the middle island.  The crepe was yummy.  The gentleman who was making the crepe was super nice and friendly.  He was making conversation with everyone while he was making the crepes. . . Wicked spoon was so much better.  More variety and better flavors.
Fave buffet in Vegas so far.... . * YES - 15-minute-only wait for champagne weekend brunch?  We got LUCKY!. * YES - Cuisines from around the world (wish they had more sushi though). * YES - Table service for all-you-can drink. * YES - They provide funny little rubber "clips" to help hold extremely hot plates. * YES - Great for groups. . * COO - Fresh-squeezed & bottled juices station, ie: watermelon or tropical fruits (see pic). * COO - They had a mini shaved ice station!  Right next to gelato display. . * WOA (words of advice):. - Casual setting. - Weekday differs from weekend prices. - Reservation touch-screen stands available for $20 fee to avoid long waits. - Platinum/Diamond status get priority (of course). . Only wish I had more room to eat a 6th plate...
Best buffet I've been to in Vegas, but it's very expensive. Long lines to get in. I'd get the players card and move up levels to avoid the wait, but I hate the hotel, the employees and the clientele here. . I'd rather keep staying at a classy place like Bellagio with classy staff, hotel and clientele and just wait in the line. It's worth one trip just to eat here, but not 2.
I loved this buffet it was amazing! I didn't eat anything I didn't like. The Mexican Food was Amazing! I really enjoyed how easy it was to check in so that you are not waiting in this long line. We went and checked in by this tablet thing then it sends you a text to come back when they are ready. GENIUS!!!!
Can I just live here? All I need is a shower and a closet for my clothes/shoes and I would NEVER leave. Why would you? They have EVERYTHING. Dim Sum, Taco Bar, Carving Station, Make-Your-Own-Charcuterie-Board, Pasta & Pizza, and endless desserts! I went twice in one week... (Oh, gluttony.) And on the plus side, I like that during lunch they offer a good range of seafood, unlike other buffets. If you're like my parents, you could go in at the tail-end of lunch and stick it out until they roll out some of the dinner items. You also end up saving a few dollars!
(This review is for DINNER.). . Was the food tasty and well-presented? Yes.. Was the selection of artisanal ice cream for dessert excellent? Yes.. Is it worth $55? Perhaps once, to say you did it, but I wouldn't go back.. . For $55 you'd expect some pretty serious cuisine. Sure, the sliders are cute, but burgers for $55? Even the poke is heavy on the salmon and light on the tuna. . . Frankly, the only food that can really justify the price is the delicious Blue Point oysters, but they put them out so slowly you have to hang around the serving table what seems like forever in order to get more than one or two. Additionally, the decor is puzzlingly pedestrian...after all the glitzy lighting at the entrance, the interior has a kind of dark-wood 1970s feel, like an upscale Golden Corral. . . Verdict: Nothing wrong with it...but it feels like a $30-35 buffet, not a $55 buffet.
I can't complain about the price as a friend treated us so it was all good. . . There was a wait, but this was for dinner and I am guessing it is always packed like this. Once we got it, it was a breeze to get our food and there are a lot of options. If you love seafood, you will love this place as there is seafood galore. I am not much of a seafood fan, but I was satisfied with what I ate and the quality of the food.
This buffet is never ending!!! It's so big you could get lost! There's so many options and didn't things to eat. The tacos were my favorite thing to eat. They had a little but if everything. I'm going back next time I'm there.
Still my favorite buffet!. . unfortunately they have cut down their gelato selection to a quarter of what it used to be.  an improvement is the electronic waiting system where it texts you when you should come back and get in the line, very convenient! . . Favorites included:. - shrimp and cheesy grits. - selection of salsas. - fresh pineapple and watermelon juice. - cheesy tots. - SUPER DELICIOUS CHICKEN and waffles. - corn bread. - ceviche. - fresh donuts with banana and syrup. - basil and sundried tomato pasta. - SEAFOOD RISOTTO (or was it a paella?) . - lobster benedict. - BISCUITS. - nutella gelato. . Don't waste your time: . - red velvet pancakes (dry and tasteless). - salty green beans. . Definitely master the technique of having a eating partner so that you can split the small plates (they add up and make you full if you eat all of it alone) so you guys can try more foods.   honestly I did not have room for more, otherwise I would have expanded into the congee and dim sum section.
Great choice of good quality food, around 100m offering different kind of food -  oysters, pizza, sushi, desserts.. Worth a visit if u are in Vegas.
I came for lunch with my asian family of 6 adults. The food is good.. There are many kind of food. The sushi sucks (not fresh, not delicious and not many choices). The service is good. The environment is comfortable. We have eaten better buffet out of Las Vegas.
Probably the best buffet out of all the casinos. The selection seems endless with hundreds of items to choose from. The average price for dinner is like $55 so you better get your monies worth. I certainly did. The biggest line inside the buffet is always at the fresh crab station, but I love to go to the back of the buffet where there is boiling crab. The crabs are split in half so it makes getting to the meat real easy and plentiful. A bowl full of garlic butter and $300 dollars worth of crab legs on your plate always makes this place worth it for $55. They have many other stations like Chinese, Italian, American and Mexican. None of these stations have anything on the main stations of Seafood and dessert. The gelato at the dessert bar is perfect soft and sweet, I slammed home so much of it. Best buffet for a buffet experience. Sometimes you get a buffet itch or curiosity and this places definitely scratches it.
This place is expensive but was so worth it. Food is good service also very good. Clean n friendly staffs. If u don't have a player card u have a long wait so get there before 5:30 pm then u don't gave to wait. . Food they have a lots of varieties n the desert was amazing.
May be a bit pricey! Spent $250. For 4. But I will go out on a limb and say that this is one of the best place that I've he ever had a buffet at. The food is the best I've tasted & it is well taken care of. the food was actually hot instead of just warm. they also have 5 different sections of food to chose from not including dessert. if your looking for a great hostess, ask for Lupe G. She is outstanding and takes very good care of you. hope this helps with anyone's food decision.
We stopped in during our vacation in Las Vegas, on the recommendation of several friends who had been there in the last 2 to 3 years. It was a disaster, being too expensive and the food was terrible. Plus, it seemed that there was some ingredient in the food that made us feel full. We usually eat 3 times what we did at this "international" buffet.. . First, we had to get instructions, from a woman, who told us that we had to go to a kiosk and get a ticket. The ticket told us, that we had to wait 61 minutes, before we could get in the line to buy into the international buffet.. We were in that line for 30 minutes, before we got to the teller that wanted $58.00 per person to eat at the "international" buffet. Took us at least 20 minutes to pay her. So after 2 hours we finally got to our seats and started to get some food. I waited at the table while the other 2 went and got food, no one approached me during that 15 minute wait. They looked happy about their selection, so off I went to find something to eat. So 2 hours and 15 minutes later, I'm searching for food.. . Second, walking down the food line, I searched through the crowd for items I might be interested in, not much caught my eye. After walking almost a block and half, I got to the beginning of the food line. Picked out some beef pepper steak, scalloped potatoes, some green beans, crab rangoons, fried asparagus and waffle wrapped chicken. Got back to my seat after 20 minutes of walking the food line. Now, 2 hours and 35 minutes have passed. The beef pepper steak, green beans and fried asparagus were all cold. Scalloped potatoes were tasty and hot. The crab rangoons had no crab in them, just cream cheese. The waffle wrapped chicken was hot, but the waffle part tasted awful,l so I peeled it off the partial chicken breast piece and ate the hot tasteless chicken. My friends had each gotten some sliders, which weren't there when I walked through, they said that the sliders were good. They also got some prime rib, of which, one got some almost raw meat and the other had to have it cooked a lot more. I couldn't get any prime rib on the first time through, as too many people were crowding the station. They each also got some cheese/sauce covered chicken breast filets, they said they were good. There weren't any either time I walked the food line. A waitress had brought drinks to the table while I was away. As I was eating my friends went back through the food line and came back to the table with some other food. Then I went a second time to get some food. There were some sliders, this time, and I was able to get some prime rib, which was now cooked a lot more. As I was leaving the "meat window", they brought out some HOT sweet potato tots which were great hot. Got some watermelon too. My friends didn't eat much of what they got the second time, complaining of being full. I ate my prime rib, which was tender, but tasteless, after salt and peppering it,  I managed to get it down before it went cold. By this time my sliders were cold and the meat was raw, so I didn't eat them. I was starting to feel full too. I ate my watermelon and my friends went and tried some desserts, which there were unable to finish because of being too full. While I was getting my second plate, a waitress came by and left some receipts for the sodas at $6.00 each. On the receipt was a note that we were requited to limit our "dining experience" to 2 hours. Each time they refilled our glasses we got more and more ice and less and less soda.. . There were mashed potatoes and gravy, 4 kinds of pizza, crab legs, muscles and shrimp on ice and all sorts of breads. I think that there were baked potatoes, but not sure. They had oyster shooters and some salad makings. I could not find any hot shrimp dishes, either breaded fried or stir-fried with or without veggies. Maybe hot/warm shrimp is a supper item.. . In conclusion, we got charged $192.00 (3 of us) for waiting in line for 2 hours and 35 minutes to eat terrible cold food and raw meat and be filled up on eating so much less food than either of us was used to eating. I would recommend that you skip this "international" buffet and go anywhere else. If you like cold crab legs and cold muscles, I recommend getting a "Caesar's player's card" or a "buffet of buffets pass". At least your culinary disaster will be cheaper than ours.
The Crawfish is Good. The Cold Shrimp is Good. The Strawberry drink is Good. The Mango drink is Good. The Lamb-Chop is Good. The Steak is OK but need to be more tender. The Fried Fish is Good. The Roasted Duck is Good. . The Mini Dessert is Good. My favorite was Macaroons, Green Tea Tiramisu, and Oreo Mousse!. Mom's favorite was the Creme Brulee and Nutella Coffee Ice Cream.
Never had a chance to eat at a buffet in Vegas so I went for the first time yesterday. Bacchanal buffet was really good with a lot of selections ranging from seafood, meats, American, Italian, salad, to Asian food. I really wish I was able to try everything but my stomach didn't let me. I tried a little of the stuff I wanted to try but definitely wasted a lot of food. Yea... I'm definitely regretting not eating that much now that I'm back in LA and craving for that buffet food haha. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas! Wish it wasn't so expensive but oh well... Come hungry!
The top 3 buffets along the strips along with wicked spoon and Wynns buffet.  The price is very high at $52 a person. This place does have the most food though compared to the other two. One must not eat 7-8 hours prior to going here for dinner. The wait can be 30-45 minutes if arriving after 6:30pm. A must try for anyone visiting vegas. I think I gained 5 lbs after eating here.
This buffet is a little spendy but if you want the best buffet in town this is where you should go.  There was not one item I did not like.  The service was excellent, the restaurant was clean, we didn't wait in line and the food is amazing.  My favorite thing was the Yellow Curry Chicken, it was the best I've ever had anywhere.  But really all of the food was cooked properly and tasted great.  Go hungry because you won't want to miss out.  They even had shaved ice at the dessert station.
Went in on Sunday. They advertised 20.00 buffet but charged 49.00. . The buffet had rock claw crab and crab legs. Our table and nearly every table around us asked the buffet workers and the servers for the shell cracker vice tool and the server said " they dont give them to us, I can bring you a hammer". They brought out one wooden mallet for three tables to share (we didnt know the people on either side of us that we were sharing the mallet with ). The mallet caused the crab claws to splinter and fly everywhere. Grown adults and three kids with pieces of hard sharp shrapnel flying EVERYWHERE.. . There was a lot of mexican food but it was sitting in buckets of grease on the hot line. The chorizo was mixed with something but you literally had to fish through a gallon of grease to get anything. Why wouldnt they drain this before they put it out. Same thing with the bacon, they had two types, regular and pepper but they were in bowls of grease??. . The fruit..... ay yi yi.... There was a little tiny corner in the back that had about 5 butter plates of fruit. The watermelon was mushy and soggy and old and there were a few other slices of slimy fruit, there were two fruit cups but again, they were drowned in syrup and more sugar syrup than actual fruit. . . There was an omelet station but there was a line of about 10 to 15 people deep and only one guy on the line. The station they had it set in left a crowd of people around and blocking other food stations and difficult to travel around. . . The cheese platters ..... BIG PRESENTATION with cheese to serve about 8 people .....you would think that this is rated the best buffet in town so why are they being so chincy and cheap with putting food out?? Food cost???. . We were never offered champagne or mimosas as the cashier told us would be offered.  . . The only great thing about the buffet was fresh squeezed bottles of juice on the buffet. I stuck one in each of my pockets as it was the brunt of my breakfast. Nothing else was appealing and what was out was a train wreck.. . Back in the day I would travel fro L.A. to Ceasers once or twice a month to play and pleasure. Ceasers was grand and the buffet and food was fit for a king, there was a time when we asked for nothing because it was all so well thought out and tremendously robust. Those days are gone. This place is a shit hole IHOP with fancy furniture and DEFINITELY NOT WORTH 49.00!!!!
This place is shockingly good. Wicked Spoon is awesome and this is better, hands down. All the ingredients taste fresh and premium, better than most of the restaurants  on the strip I presume. Expensive ($60) and can be a long wait (20min at off peak 4pm hour), but totally worth it. For sure the best buffet here, and I've tried them all.
Went in at $58.19 per person,  heard a lot of great things about this place, so I had high expectations. With a group of 8, was pleasantly surprised at the variety they had which was expected with 9 kitchens and 500+ menu items. Whether it's a quick fix ox tail pho to waygu sliders and your usual grill meats... Must I add im not much of a brisket fan but rather prime rib,  it was the most tender perfectly cooked brisket I've ever eaten.  Definitely ate my money's worth with quantity and quality.
We waited hours to get in by the time we got in I was not hungry... I did not see anything exceptional so crowded .   I guess if you love crab legs then enjoy. but i dont eat that....  Disappointed... and expensive!   I rather pay that price and have a nice sit down dinner!
Oysters. Crab. Prime rib. Dessert. I'm in heaven! This review is long over due and well deserved. I am the hugest fan of buffets and always try to get the biggest bang for my buck. You will never see noodles, bread, rice or any other nonsense on my plate. When I see people with half a plate of chow mein, a little piece of me dies inside and I lose hope for humanity. What a waste when there is such a huge selection of amazing food. There are different prices depending on the day and time. Dinner buffet is around $50+. Pricey but worth the money and the wait. . . This buffet has a large selection of all different types of cuisine. . . - Fresh raw oysters and shooters. - All different kinds of meat cuts. - hot and cold crab (cut in half for all the lazy people out there). - mussels, shrimp, crawfish (yum), etc. - There is a person making tacos, ramen, pho, etc.. - Every dessert you can think of is there. Macarons, ice cream sandwiches, creme brulee, cakes, cookies, gelato, mochi, crepes, chocolate covered strawberries, etc. The list goes on and on.. . Bacchanal  has dethroned Wicked Spoon and is currently my favorite buffet in Vegas.
Yes, it is expensive.  Yes, it is the best buffet I've ever had.  Each station serves food that tastes good enough to be served on a menu.  The desserts are ridiculous (lava cake... Wow), so are the meats at the carving station (one of the best lamb chops I've ever had).  I am from San Diego, land of Mexican food and I can say that the made-to-order street tacos are almost on par with those at taco shops in my hometown.  If you can spare the $50, absolutely worth the price.
Come hungry!!! We waited in line for this buffet for quite a while but it proved to be DEEEEELICIOUS! The selection, the variety,. Quality, I can't say enough! It wasn't cheap but we all left happy!
The food was good tasting in most cases (steaks did not have flavor). I liked very much the oysters, pizza, lamb, lobster corn chowder and crab legs. There was no lobster and for the price it should be included (two years ago I went to another LV buffet for about $40 and everyone was served lobster tails).. . Service was not good but it wasn't the worst. I think that even though food was good it is not worth the money.. . Im glad I ate here because of the experience and variety but not sure if I would go back.
Dinner at 5:30 on Saturday night, July 19. Only waited in line 10 minutes. We had a 24 hour buffet pass and knew that we would have to pay a surcharge to use the pass at the Bacchanal Buffet. Was surprised that the surcharge was $32. Without the pass, the dinner cost for the buffet was $52.. . We were seated all the way in the very back of the restaurant which was a perfect spot. We had just a few other four tops around us and our dining room was relatively quiet and away from the clans of families seated at larger tables. Also one end of the buffet was just outside our dining area. It was from this end of the buffet that I began my assessment of just what exactly $52 gets one at this very popular buffet. My strategy before I pickup a plate is to walk the entire buffet line so I can see just what they have to offer and then plan my attack after I have gathered all my intel. . . I don't remember the order of the food stations that I passed on my recon of the smorgasbord but remember passing a sushi, Mexican cuisine, and Italian  food and thinking to myself that I have already seen all this type of food at other cheaper buffets. I was already halfway through my recon of the food line and did not see one item that I wanted to go back for and try nor had yet to see any item that justified the cost of the buffet. I finally passed a station and saw that there were steaming king crab legs being served from lobster pots. Made a note of that station and continued scouting the food line. After turning a corner I saw the lines queuing up at two food stations at the other end of the buffet closest to the entrance. One station was a carving station with at least 25 people backed up waiting online for some meat with one carver there handling at least seven or eight kinds of meat.  Why wouldn't Ceasers spread this meat amongst two carving stations and spread out the crowd? There was no one standing online in any of the other food stations I had already passed so they obviously have room to expand to less used areas of the buffet. I was beginning to get irritated that I had to wait online for food that cost so much money and had yet to impress me. Then I looked passed the carving station to the next food station to see an even longer line was queued up.  This I realized this was the money shot of the buffet; king crab legs, stone crab claws and cooked shrimp. So this was what I was paying so much for: the opportunity to stand in line to eat still frozen crab. . . While the dessert selection was good, it did not compensate for the lack of variety of food on the main buffet nor did it justify the cost. I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before we had eaten here. I feel sorry for some of the Yelp reviewers who stated they waited up to 4 hours in line to eat at this place. I would not come back here nor recommend this buffet. There are much better buffets at the Mandalay Bay, the Encore and Cosmopolitan for less money and less wait time.
This is by far my favorite buffet in Vegas.  They have the best choices and the quality of food is hands down the best.  . . If you happen to come here before 3pm on a weekend, mimosas are included in the fee.  Def try to get here before the cutoff time to take advantage of the bubbly.  They offer all types of cuisines.  The buffet offers crab legs, succulent shrimp cocktail, prime rib, brisket, along with your typical carnivorous meats, Mexican food, Chinese, sushi and you can create your own pho/ramen too.  Their dessert selection is off the chain!!! So much too choose from so try to leave a bit of room for the sweets!  . . If I had one complaint it would be the check in process.  I recently noticed this last visit they implemented a check in time for parties.. You walk to a screen and enter the number of people in your party and are given a print out that says the time you check back with the front hostess.  This can take up to two + hours. Once you get to this point, you get in line to pay.  This is where I feel like the employees did more chatting than working efficiently.  Our group was given two diff instructions from two diff ladies that conflicted each other's instructions, making it seem like they were both not on the same page regarding protocol.
Went here on a Thursday for lunch, had to wait 15 min to get seated.It was about $100 for 2 adults 1 child. They say this is thebest Buffet in vegas so I had to try it. They have alot of dessert to choose from. They have all sorts of foods from Tacos,Sushi,Pizza,Fish,Ribs,Pasta. I would reccomend this place to Yelpers.This is the best review buffet in vegas.The sushi was great the service was great.Pizza tasted good and so did the fish. Give it a try you will love it.
The food was good, not wow or anything, id say average strip buffet food; def on the pricy side. The price online does not match, so don't bother to check coz it's always different. Love the gelato and shave ice, lots to choose from. Overall, don't think I'll go back coz the price, u can def find a cheaper price for the same kind of food in Vegas.
OMG. They have everything for everyone. The price tag is a bit steep but it is worth every penny. Mexican? Check. Chinese? Check. Continental? Check. Will you have a blowout while sitting and stuffing your face full of food? You betchya!
If you ask me what my favorite meal of all the time there is no doubt that my first experience at Bachannal is up there.  It's a Vegas buffet, what can you say?. . It's hard to talk about the food since there is a lot of selection but my favorites were the lamb chops, the sliders, sea bass with miso glaze, braised octopus with creamy polenta (a chef's special sadly), the brisket, and their fried chicken.  I also really enjoyedtheir seafood selection (oysters!).. . The first time I went my friends and I waited 3 hours in line as their was no good system to get in.  By my 2nd visit (about 2 weeks ago as of this posting) their was a computerized system where you put in your phone number and they tell you when to come back.  I thought this made the whole experience better and much more streamlined. Of course, depending on how crowded Vegas is that weekend, your wait time may still be 3 hours.  The 2nd time I visited we got in under 40 minutes (even arriving at the same time...of course the golden time near the end of lunch before dinner seating!).  Enjoy!
I be been here for lunch and dinner and the food is great. Not huge but still a very good selection with great present. They have a beautiful selection of desserts as well. Steamed crab legs are the best!! The food overall is a bit salty but still my favorite buffet on the strip so I have to give it 5 stars!!
The food was fresh, the selection was a bit narrow as far as buffets go. The flavors in my opinion were a bit muted. The seating was not great and a bit crowded. The dining area was immaculate and the service was great. Worth the price but not a wow for this diner.
Dude, anyone who says that the quality of the food at Bacchanal does not match the steep price of entrance is a VERY confused and disturbed child. The quality and creativity of the foods available at this buffet completely puts other casino buffets to shame. Because every dish is made in small batches and constantly replaced, the quality and freshness is never compromised for any guest. . . Their seafood station is an absolute dream for any true seafood lover. They have huge fresh oysters, incredible smoked trout, and a gazpacho with crab that's toe-curling good.. . The gourmet and impressively fresh salad and vegetable selections won both my dining partner and I over. I highly suggest that you grab the chicken and waffles as well. I didn't eat the waffles as I only grabbed the dish because I was in the mood for fried chicken. The Bacchanal makes good fried chicken that didn't leave an oily residue on my finger tips at all! It was crisp, juicy, and everything I wanted out of fried chicken.. . And as other reviewers have raved, the dessert station is something you just need to see and experience for yourself. Stupendous, top notch selection! They have green tea cookies, chocolate cookies, espresso tarts, mousses, cheese cakes, cupcakes, cake pops, everything! Usually when I go to buffets I'm not one to gorge myself and I usually just stop eating when I'm comfortably full (I know, I'm unusual..) but the Caesar's Palace made me want to leave a little bit overstuffed and I feel great about it.
Our favorites were the oxtail soup, clams in saffron sauce, and some potato dish with truffle oil :). Definitely loved the desserts too--endless shaved ice was AWESOME and the green tea creme brulee was mind-blowing.
Amazing buffet not your typical buffer offerings.  Had something for everyone. Or if you just wanted to sample a bunch of different cuisines. Dishes that stood out were the Kung Pow chicken it was spicy and so good. Also the beef brisket was smoked with the right amount of flavor.  Can't say I disliked anything and we tried almost everything.  Worth the $60 a person price tag. And I am frugal and don't say that often. Oh and the dessert buffet was so amazing!!!
Omg, this is the most expensive buffet ever! Two people for $116.73?!! We enjoyed their strawberry juice the most. It is the most expensive juice bar ever and the loud music gives you indigestion. Server Maryam was very good and nice!
Arrived here at 520pm. Short wait. 53.99 per person before tax. Worth it though. King crab legs were by far the most sought after item. Their dim sum was good too. Dessert was prob one the best I've ever had. . . Must try if you're in Vegas. Huge huge buffet too. Lots of choices and options! You won't regret it. Way better than the Wynn buffet. Either same or better than wicked spoon in my opinion.
People said Bacchanal is the best buffet in Vegas. Compared with the wicked spoon in Cosmopolitan, the buffet at Wynn, I decided to rank Bacchanal as the number ONE on my buffet list in Vegas. Why? The variety is definitely the top reason. No matter western or eastern,people from around the world can find the food they are familiar with. This place wow me by offering their guests abundant fresh seafood such as oyster and mussel. My dad enjoyed the T-bone steak very very much and even had two of them. I especially like their fruit crepe which is made immediately in front of me. I recommend this buffet for people who can not decide which buffet to go in this sin city!
I was rather excited to visit this buffet after the big redesign several years ago.  Previously - the Caesars buffet was something that didn't really pique my interest.  Even though I've stayed on the property several times, I've always found myself dining elsewhere when it comes to the buffet.  This time around I decided to give it a try based on the all the buzz about the refit.. . I'm glad to say the buffet lived up to expectations ... for the most part.  . . This place now reminds me of Wicked Spoon and the buffet at Aria.  It's much more modern and features lots of small exotic dishes along with the usual copious servings of seafood, meat, Asian stuff etc. that you'd expect from a traditional Vegas buffet.  Even the little taco station was a nice touch.. . As for the food itself, the quality was pretty decent.  The crab legs were great and it was nice to see them freshly steamed and served hot on your plate.  The meat section was intense, with lots of options to choose from.  Unfortunately I was only a fan of the prime rib as the other meats I tried (pork spare ribs, brisket, lamb etc.) were all on the dry side.  The sushi was also so-so, and relatively dry.  However, the other seafood offerings (cold and hot) were pretty excellent and the dessert section was definitely worth saving room for.. . The ambiance was nice, though I wish the smaller tables weren't so close to each other.However it didn't detract from my overall experience.. . Personally I still think this buffet ranks among the top 3 in Vegas (alongside the Wynn and Wicked Spoon @ the Cosmopolitan).  However if I had to pick the best, I'd still go with the Wynn simply because even though their selection is inferior, the quality per dish is just a bit better.  Nonetheless, I think Caesars made huge strides here and I would still definitely come back on my next visit to LV.
The best buffet in Las Vegas, no long lines to wait in. Just give them your phone # they text you when to come back. The food is delicious and they have a great selection from seafood to prime rib. Worth every penny
I ate here several days ago for lunch. This was probably my 5th time here. It was so over the top for a lunch buffet I had to post this. . Some of the items that were really just awesome were.. . Beef Ribs. Prime Rib. Lobster with a cream sauce on a biscuit. Large Cocktail shrimp. Raw Oysters. Crab Claws. . These were just some of the items and there were many,many more.. . The attention to the quality of the food was outstanding. It was not just a lot of food but a lot of great food. My only issue was I only could try so much.. . At this point I have tried many of the Las Vegas large  hotel buffets. Hands down this is the best, it blows away the rest.
Okay. This place is heftyexpensive. If you're here to eat the vast amount of carb dishes they have here- Get out. You need the crab legs, the oysters. Eat the lamb, for god's sake. If you did what I did, which was indeed eat all the delicious dishes they had that weren't the meat or seafood- you done did it. You had a meal that was worth $20-$40 instead of the $51 (weekday) or $54 (weekend) you paid. That's okay, though. I don't regret any of it.. . First of all, if you're on vacation (which you probably are) and are planning to eat here, DON'T EAT A HUGE LUNCH.  I don't care how big you claim your stomach to be; this is an all you can eat so you better make it worth it. . . There is everything. EVERYTHING. They've even got pho for God's sake. And sushi. And lots of European dishes. Quality is top notch because of the amount of people that eat here. Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything.. . Dessert was also amazing. They have gelato and mochi ice cream and cakes and macarons and cookies and... yeah, you get the point. Just look at all the pictures that were uploaded. Delicious. . . But apart from the bill, this place was pretty good. I loved it. I think, however, that the price could be lowered a bit. Didn't it use to be $36 or so back in 2011? Oh, how the times have changed.
Who cares about the price it's Vegas baby... That being said this place is disgusting.... Filthy and I mean filthy chairs. Noticed the dirty silverware before even sitting down and don't even get me started on the dried food all over the wall next to my chair. Spent the whole meal trying not to touch anything while yelling at my son to do the same. Should of went to Denny's.
Las Vegas is changing all the time. It's always out with the old, in with the new. It is always best to be the newest and the hottest in Vegas. You always need to reinvent yourself. Caesar's Palace is one place where thought it is an old property compared to the rest, it keeps it fresh and interesting on the inside. This change also happens to the buffets as well. You can't have endless roast beef and a mound of crab legs and say you are the best. These days, we want gourmet stuff, and a lot of it. That is why small plates of different dishes are popular at Vegas buffets. Bacchanal Buffet in Caesar's Palace is just the place. Taking Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon off its short lived rein as top dog, Bacchanal is the newest Buffet in town.. . Coming here on a Sunday as a last hurray meal, the line was packed. Payard across the way was looking mighty tempting. No line, no wait. It is safe to say, I waited in line for everyone who reads my blog -- This is for you! The wait was nearly an hour, but it was the newest buffet in Vegas. I had to.. . I was glad to see a lot of variety at this buffet. They had small dishes of different things. Instead of ladling on the food from a pile of food, you just pick up the plates that look My favorites included the authentic tacos, cured meats, and crab legs. Bacchanal buffet featured many items that aren't available at a normal buffet. For this reason, the buffet was a good experience.. . Going to a buffet is all about having everything you want, even dessert. You can have your cake, and eat it too. Their dessert selection was quite impressive. From cookies in a jar to macarons, and ice cream, you can have anything you want. My favorite were the crepes. I just saw the jar of Nutella and I was set. The crepes were wonderfully prepared and were a great finish to my buffet.. . Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace is awesome. Their new approach to the buffet in Vegas is refreshing. Pretty soon, all of the top tier Vegas buffets will have to do this. One thing I did not like about the buffet is the inconsistency of the design. I prefer open spaces when eating at buffets, but theirs was a bit broken up. It was tough to navigate through the different sections. Also, the seating areas are not all the same. The outside area was wide open and bright, but there were seating areas in the corners and different rooms. Not all of the furniture (tables are chairs) was the same. This made for an uneven feeling and everything felt clustered. Other than that though, the food was great. Still though, my all time favorite buffet is still Wicked Spoon.
Had dinner here on Sunday night. So many different types of food to choose from but I just ate from the Mexican part.. Absolutely delicious tacos, mouthwatering and cooked to the fullest. . I ended the night with a Nutella crepe, mint chip ice cream, flan and cheesecake.. I would definitely recommend getting a Nutella crepe, so delicious. I've found myself craving one for the past 2 days!. . The customer service is also very incredible. Everyone is so polite and brings you another drink even if you're not finished with your first!. . Definitely a restaurant one must visit at least once on a Vegas trip.. Extremely pricey (66.82), but worth it!
This will only be the second time in the 5 years i have been on Yelp that I'm giving somewhere a 1 star review....thats how bad my experience was here. Do not waste your money on this buffet. We had not 1, but 2 bad experiences here! Let me break it down for you as i see it:. . Quality of food: 2-3 stars. Selection of food: 2 stars. Atmosphere: 4 stars. Cleanliness: 1 star. Management: ZERO (first zero I have ever given to a restaurant EVER). . We showed up for dinner on a Sunday evening for dinner at about 8:30pm. We were told by the hostess that they were at capacity and were not taking in any more customers until no sooner than 9:30. Me and my party decided to wait until 9:30 since it was raining and didn't feel like walking somewhere else. So at 9:10 my friend checks with the hostess to see if we can get in before 9:30. She says no we are still not letting people in and it will be no sooner than 9:30 before we can enter. Great, nothing wrong with that...as we are standing there waiting (no more than 2 mins later) as we are standing 40 feet away she starts letting people in! So my friend walks back over to see whats going on and she says "Ok we will take you now." WTF!. . So now we are in line, which starts after the hostess stand we wait another 10-15 mins to get up to the counter to pay. As we are paying they tell us that they will be pulling all the food off the serving stations @ 10:30pm. So we are like okay, no problem. We waited this long to eat, that still gives us about an hour to eat...no problem. So we pay and once again....we wait....in line....again. This time for another 10 mins. They are finally ready to seat us. While we are being shown to our table we notice that there is a HUGE line at the buffet inside the restaurant! The line had to have been another 15-20 mins long. After seeing the line we realized that there was no way we had time to stand in the line every time you wanted something from the main buffet station and still eat our food in what was now less than an hour from when they took the food away. Mind you this buffet with tax was costing us $58 per person. If this was the case they should not be letting more paying customers in.. . We ask to speak with a manger and got our money refunded back to us and we leave....but we still haven't eaten and all the good restaurants in Vegas close at 10pm. We ended having to eat at some diner because we waited for so long and now nothing else was open. . . Next day....for some ungodly reason we attempt to go back, this time to their breakfast buffet. We arrive at 11:03am, they inform us that they are now serving the "Lunch Buffet, breakfast buffet stopped at 11am sharp" and that the price will now be $40 per person instead of $18 (i think). Whatever, it was after 11am so i'm not complaining.....HOWEVER....wait for it.....the party in line with us is PISSED! We can hear the guy complaining to a manger..."we have been in line for over 20 mins and you wouldn't let us in! Now that it's 11:01 you are going to let us in just so you can charge us more money!" I totally felt for this guy, i have no doubt that he was right. And they were a party of 7 so that's really a lot more money. And here's the kicker...they were still serving breakfast food for the duration of the time we were inside!. . So now we get to the table, go get our plates and wait in the line for the main buffet station for about 15 mins to get up there and find that there really wasn't even a good selection. I think they had 3 different meats to choose from and no crab legs. They did however have Lobster corn chowder, so i got a bowl....it was cold. FML..... . The whole experience was HORRIBLE...2 days prior we ate at the lunch buffet at Aria and it was awesome. All the prime rim, crab legs and sushi you could eat....and it was only $30 per person. Go there....go anywhere....just don't go to the buffet at Caesar's Palace. What a disappointment, prob the worst restaurant experience of my life.
Hmm, I don't know who choose this buffet out of our group. But it was just ok. The long lines and high expectations had my mouth watering.. . I went straight to the oysters and raw bar. The raw barwas excellent but the second and third batch of oysters were not as good as the first one. I also got a chance to check out their asian cuisine and it was pretty good. The Mexican was a hit or miss and same for the meats. The desert table was fabulous. . . Here's my breakdown:. . Rawbar: 4 star. Mexican: 3 star. Asian: 4 star. Meats: 3 star (inconsistent flavors). Italian: 3 star. Dessert: 4.5 star. Ambience: 4 star (Asian bar and Italian section was in a back section of the buffet that was separated). . This place was ok. I've had better buffet experience and taste at other places. Wish I could have at least given this place a 4 star but it was just ok. Nothing exceptional but not bad. Just in the middle.
Went here on a Friday for dinner. We went early due to other reviews about long lines. Lines were fine when we arrived, decent length when we left.. . Only gave 2 stars due to high price buffet and barely average food.  Best part of the meal were the great choices of gelato.  Sushi was decent - nothing interesting. Thought the seafood portion was gross - some of the shrimp I had were slimy and didn't bother to eat.
I think I liked this one the best out of all the buffets we visited (MGM, Cravings, and Aria). I've still got my fair share to try but I'm getting there!!. . Things that stood out: . . Ramen! Not only was it awesome to watch them cook it, but it was absolutely delicious. . . Indian curries- delicious!. . Crab legs- They're everywhere but they were great. . . Baby sliders- Juicy and fresh! They were also small, which is a good thing!. . Roasted Veggies-random right? But they were seasoned very well and weren't too soft. . . The little bowls that had an array of soups/ pasta dishes/gumbos- The presentation is so nice! . . The green chili chicken with rice- the chicken was juicy, not dry, and the rice was delicious as well. It was hard not to eat too much! I needed to save room for more options . . Mochi- so awesome!!! . . Desserts- There were a ton, and they were, for the most part, all amazing and delicious. . . I also like how you can almost get lost. The food kind of wraps around the wall and it just keeps going and going and going. In the middle close to the entrance is the dessert bar which is an entire circle filled with heavenly treats.
I frequently run to Vegas for a quick business retreat. I'm not part of the player club at Caesar cause I'm not the gambling type. But I just pay the $20 express fee. I usually eat as much steak and sausages I can. A long with the casual Asian food dishes. The servers are really prompt and always checking up on yiu. The cooks are busy cooking away. Not much to talk to, sometimes the chef cutting the steak or sausage would explain the meat choices other times it seem he is having a bad day and just want to leave already.. . I come here all the time when I head to vegas.
Yep, still pretty great.
Not worth the extra bucks. Seafood was good, fresh snow crabs & oysters. But asian food section sucked big time.
supposedly Bacchanal means "Feast for the Gods", but what's the most godly (most godly? godliest?) about this place is the definitely the hype. Bacchanal is an amazing buffet, true - but I think I've had a few better. (Bellagio, Wynn, etc).. . it's a little pricey, and organization/service a tad slow. on a busy day (high season or weekends), you'd probably have to go at like 4:30 pm to avoid a 1 hr+ wait. . something unique/cool that Bacchanal does is have like a "fast pass" system of waiting in line. you put your name into a virtual line and they give you a time period you can return between so you don't have to physically wait in line. in theory, it sounds super impressive. only downside is that once you come back in your allotted time, it takes them impossibly long just to seat you.. . FOOD: I think this buffet's saving grace is its dessert selection. gelato, mochi, pastries, macarons galore! the desserts were definitely the highlight of my meal. they have an extensive seafood section with crab legs... but the wait for them was really long. some other highlights: meat & cheese section (I live for prosciutto!), dim sum and pho sections, chicken and waffles section. . overall... one of my top 5 favorite buffets in vegas, but probably not my first choice. that being said - I'll most likely be Bacch! (har har)
This is the best buffet I have been to hands down. I have probably been to buffets that have had a lil bit more of a selection. I can't recall ever being at one that was better quality.. . Had the dinner buffet this time. We arrived at about 8 PM and waited about 20 minutes to be seated which was fine. To be honest, I thought the wait would be a lot longer considering how many people were waiting. I guess there were a bunch of larger parties and couples were being seated much quicker. Once inside...There was a pretty large line at the crab leg station, so I'm sure that would be annoying to some people but I don't eat crab so it didn't effect me. There was also a decent line at the meat carving station but it moved quickly and was worth the wait. Pretty much everything else you could walk right up and get. The highlights for me were the: prime rib, lamb shanks, Kung Pao chicken and some really good pasta that had what appeared to be sun dried tomato in it. Oh yeah, I forgot the lil hamburger sliders, those were awesome. I also can't leave out the desserts. The bread pudding was awesome and I had a lil piece of cheesecake with a passion fruit topping that was garnished with a Blackberry, so good.. . The service was good, empty plates were always gone by the time I returned from another trip. Our waiter even refilled our soft drinks while we were away at the buffet, never experienced that before. . . I love this buffet and I will continue to visit every time I return to Vegas. Just thinking about it is making me hungry.
Sorry this post is long over due. I was at this buffet during the July 4th weekend and it was wonderful Food was great and they had such an amazing variety of selection. This is my second time being here and I have no complaints. The lines do get long . We have the member card so was let in right away. . I have had other buffets here in Vegas but this one has been the best one so far.
