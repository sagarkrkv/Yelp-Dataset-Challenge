Nice hotel. Very convenient in terms of shopping, eating out, and gambling.  Also dealers are very friendly. I come here at least once or twice a year and they have been very consistent in a good way.
Amazing hotel, stayed for 3 nights for a work convention. I was put in a suite. It was super big for 1 person, had a couch and social area. Very nice room, attentive housekeeper, although they didn't come until about 3pm. . . Casino and restaurants were nice and clean. Everything was very well kept. . . Will surely stay there again when in Vegas. :)
Rooms were OK and spacious (suites with a large bathroom, 3 TVs and a sunken living room) but overall seemed a little dated - I think Encore or Wynn has nicer rooms and a more updated casino (and less of that smokey smell in the casino) - although Palazzo is a little bit more convenient from a walking distance standpoint (albeit it is right next door to Wynn and Encore).  The highlight of staying here is eating at Carnevino which is an awesome must-try Italian steakhouse!
Oh yea, the stakes are high. The suite was spectacular and definitely the way to go when you're here. Sure, you barely spend time in the hotel room, "but when I  do, I prefer ZZ" (read: Dosh Zetas) because the Palazzo will treat you like you've worked hard enough not to pamper yourself. The blinds open at the push of a button on the bedside remote? check. The bathroom with separate door toilet? check, the DOWN comforter and pillows? check check. This is my third suite and compared to Cosmopolitan and The Signature at MGM, it's more for the adults 30-50's (doesn't mean though that is older looking, means it's higher class and you are the president of your own...apartment?). Cosmo for 20-35 y/o, Signature for family or larger groups who prefer kitchenette. Choose wisely. . . The only silly thing? lifted up a pretzel box and got charged for the room for $8. Obviously it follows the fridge's law, do not move absolutely-anything-type of sensor, but come on. You put it there, all good looking candy in fancy boxes, I WILL lift and SEE...right??? you would too if you saw all those boxes all so nicely placed in front of the TV. (One of the TVs). Watching the FIFA games simultaneously in both TVs? check. The bed was exquisite and the whole room just clean, cool, comfortable. . . TAO nightclub is ok, been to LAVO before and it's ok too. Drinks at TAO club sucked (nasty) and were $15 each, i expected at least a tasty mL, no can do. . . The food at TAO was absolutely amazing. Incredible dishes, i couldn't have asked for more. The sea bass, spicy chicken and lobster/kimchi fried rice were to die for. The filet mignon was just ok. Nice wine selection. The music was very loud for dinner time since the club was right upstairs. It was my friends birthday and they brought out a giant fortune cookie crepe (hard) dipped partly in chocolate and filled with vanilla and chocolate mousse, read Happy Birthday. We had a great time and a great dinner celebration! . . OUTSTANDING. I can't wait to come back.
A very gool experience as only Vegas can deliver. Marble tile everywhere. Nice furniture, well appointed desk with all-in-one printer/scanner/fax ready to go. Three TVs, No corners cut on the bathroom. Sunken living room was nicely done, lots of comfy seating. Views were nice for our room covering the pool and spa below, Treasure Island the Northern heart of the strip.  Only about 20% view was humdrum as it encompassed the mall, off-strip Trump building and it's adult superstore. Bedding was nice, but not superior. Nice privacy with good sound control. Checkin and checkout was perfect except my son setting off the snack detector by lifting the box of gummy bears to take a look, but the front desk removed it without quarrel.  Casino was nice, A/C worked quickly and smoothly, parking wasn't bad, amentities in the room were adequate, and free wifi was sure and steady and very much appreciated. We enjoyed our two night stay and will consider returning.. . But, room for improvement. Map for Palazzo are more detailed at the Venetion. Once you approve Palazzo, they grow devoid of details, like where the theatre is. I know the idea is to drive people to the Casino, but we lost our prime seats at the show trying to find their showcase theatre. The Fridge is totally full of sensored drinks, no room to safely stick in your own half liter bottle. Kinda sad making long ice runs in the 21st century just to acheive cool water. Way too few towels for a "luxury suite". Double doors at the bathroom are a total hassle, they overlap the front door's arc and the noisy catches kind suck when you have to open booth to smoothly egress in the dark. Biggest letdown, housekeeping. Three drawers were full of laundry/clothing from a previous guest. One draw was not attached to the tracks and fell out if you opened it in the chest. Small candy wrappers and misc scraps littered the floor on checkin. On our one morning, we walked out and greeted the housekeeper as we pulled the DND tag from the door. On our return, the tag was back on the door and room untouched! Wow. Was our tip and request for more towels not worthy of their service?
Very beautiful room and very coimfortabl at a decent price.  Definitely want to stay there again!
Since variety is the spice of life, I always try to stay somewhere new when I go to LV. I do have a favorite though, Encore, but I've heard great things about Palazzo so we gave it a try this past weekend. The hotel was awesome and we loved the rooms decor and overall size. We did visit a friends room a the Venetian and the Palazzo swims circles around those rooms in terms of age and overall style, imo.  Not to mention that getting to the rooms in the Venezia tower of the Venetian is a straight up maze....no grazie! If you are on the fence about Palazzo, pull the trigger and you wont be disappointed!
SUMMARY - Pretty average hotel, good location, the shops/restaurants are nice but the rooms are showing their age and the pool is YUK (Pool Scum!!).. . SHOPS/RESTAURANTS - Good, it had plenty of them at all different levels. The Bourbon lounge was fun with old rock videos and the guy with the twisted sister wig was funny and kept things going. Lavo looked nice but didn't actually get there. The Grand Lux was very nice as an easy, 24/7 place to go - breakfast, late snacks. Basically an always open cheesecake factory. . . ROOMS -  were ok, just average. This is an all suite hotel so if you're a family it's nice to have the larger living area which you could have small kids sleep in etc. But they are showing their age. The first one we got was a smoking room (they offered it as an 'upgrade' because it had a view). It was smelly and very dusty - and the view was pretty ordinary - so if offered this as an 'upgrade' just refuse.  The next room actually had a better view and was clean, but still these are not modern rooms. Not bad though.. . POOLS - HORRIBLE.  on the first day at 10.30am we noticed really bad pool scum all around the main pool at the sides.  Really bad, if you have a hot tub you may have seen it after too many people have been in there. Didn't get cleaned up all day. Complained to the manager. Just got a 'its been handled' response. On check out told the girl that we couldn't use the pool and she credited the resort fee, which was good (that raised this from a 2 to a 3 star).  Also note that all the pools are for kids, there's no adults only pool.  AND most of the pools are in shade until 1pm!!  So before that you have to cram into one of the two pools that get sun if you want to go.. . So, don't want to be one of these people that complain and give the hotel a one star review because someone looked at them funny, but truly this is not a 5 star hotel IMHO.  It probably used to be, but it's aging, the pool areas are badly designed, the service is meh, and for the money there are better options, or else spend maybe $50 more and go to one of the newer places and have a really nice time.. . This is ok for families with kids etc, and that's what you see at the hotel, but if you are between 25 to 55 and have seen better then you may be disappointed.
Wonderful stay! The front desk people gave us a little care package when we arrived, since we always forget our toothbrushes and toothpaste, it was a big help!. . The room itself was beautiful including the bathroom, I was seriously shocked!. . Also, I loved the remote operated blinds, they really made my mornings a lot easier since they were blackout shades :)
Was a nice hotel - annoying that you have to walk through the casino to get to your room, however what strip hotel doesn't??. Was upgraded due to being an IHG ambassador member (highly advisable to get). . Downfall was a 9:20am knock on the door from room service even though our room was double locked per hotel's instructions. Who gets up before 10am in Vegas???
Big fan of the Venetian and the Palazzo. I like the Palazzo perhaps a smidge more because the parking here is easier.  The recently switched the black jack payout to 6/5 on most tables which is a big drawback for anyone who plays the game.
This is my favorite place to gamble.  They have a nice variety of machines, especially the penny machines.  And I've done pretty well there over the years.  Not to mention, they have decent staff and great restaurants.  Their Grazie Players club is great.  They have great comps and slot/resort credits.
I really enjoyed my recent stay here. My room that I had reserved (King Suite, Smoking) was not available so I had to settle for a 2 Queen suite. Ironically, it was directly across from the last room I had :) All my years staying here and the best view I ever got was the Wynn golf course. This time it was a center strip view of Treasure Island and over looking the pools. I almost went down to the pool but did not feel like hunting for swim trunks in my size. Anyway, kudos for the view!It was an unexpected surprise. I was overcharged for the mini bar, I got mostly snacks but the problem is that the staff randomly puts the snacks in random places or other guests move them around taking advantage of the 30 second sensor rule. Only an extra $5 for $50 worth of stuff I used. Obviously expensive- $5 for a bottle of coke portioned to a can size; $9 for a box of chips, etc. I'm happy it was never restocked otherwise I would have spent more since I don't like leaving the room when I get back in. The couch and sunken living room look nice but the couch is fairly uncomfortable, probably do to being a fold out variety. My last issue was that they took out all of the good oversized safes (which used to be next to the mini bar under the TV) which used to pull out and were equipped with outlets, and the whole 9 yards but now use the standard small closet safe. . . As typical, everything else was nice. The beds are among the best I have ever slept on. Check In was efficient and did not take all that long. As for the casino staff, I'm not sure if they have a lot of turnover or what. It's a big place and some of the familiar friendly faces are no where to be found. I will say as for the Dealers, the gaming was very inconsistent. On my arrival day, the Swing shift was amazing. The next day they were less so. The night crew was not all that great any of the nights, they used to be the best. The day crew alternates, I think the part timers are the best. The morning I left they were all friendly and were not the regulars. . . The Elevators were very slow for some reason. This is the first time I have noted this at a Sands property. All three days it seemed like only a small number of them were working at any given time. The scales in the bathroom are just for show, they don't work. The shower as always, has an endless supply of hot water with great water pressure. Its still my favorite place to stay I think of any hotel I have been to because it feels like home.
We stayed at the Palazzo this past July 2-6. I decided to treat my parents, sister and 2-year old niece to Vegas for 4th of July Weekend. I had previously stayed at the Venetian back when it opened, but had never stayed at its sister property, The Palazzo. I chose The Palazzo because I wanted to treat my parents to some place upscale, yet not too uppity (Wynn). I am very glad to have chosen The Palazzo over the other properties I was looking at. The biggest deciding factor for me was that they have the Bella Suite, which has 2 beds, plus the pull out bed; thus allowing both my parents to sleep on one bed, my sister and niece on the other bed, and myself on the pullout in the sunken living room.. . I will say The Palazzo has great people working for it. Whomever is in charge of their hiring needs a raise. Someone earlier posted that Alexandria checked them in and they had a pleasant experience with her. I echo their sentiment, as she both checked me in, and checked me out. She is a true gem of the Palazzo's. (More on her later) . . As has been discussed in great detail on here already, all the rooms at The Palazzo are big suites, that are well appointed with exceptional decor and furniture, with plenty of amenities to make even the most discriminating of guests feel well pampered within the suite. Although I booked a regular Bella Suite, at check-in I politely asked if there were any complimentary upgrades, and thus we got upgraded to a Bella Suite on the 42nd floor overlooking the strip. This was very awesome because on the evening of 4th of July, that is where we were able to get a great view of the Caesars Palace fireworks show from our room. (My 2-year old niece gets scared of fireworks [mainly the noise]), and so being able to watch the fireworks from up in the 42nd floor, behind soundproof windows was a god-send for us. . . My sister had researched things to do with a 2-year old in Vegas, and we were glad that the pools at The Palazzo were very spacious and not too full. My sister had plenty of things planned for my niece, but my niece absolutely fell in love with the pools, thus my sister would take her down a couple times a day so she could enjoy herself, in between naps in the room, and taking her out to eat in the Canal Shoppes throughout. We also hit the strip once the sun had set, so that my niece could enjoy the Vegas lights at night, while in her stroller. Not one dull moment for us, or my niece.. . My parents being the big gamblers they are, I signed them up for the Grazie Club, and both got free T-shirts at signing up. They enjoyed the penny slots at the nearby Flamingo, Harrah's, and Bally's. Myself, I did a little bit of gambling at The Palazzo (Never chase the comp, just enjoy your gambling ;-) ) . . If any of you enjoy great drinks, I strongly suggest you try out the Fusion Bar (You can't miss it, it's the bar to your right as you're about to enter the hallway into the elevator banks to go up to the rooms). Each night, I was done gambling by 2am, and I'd mozy on over to the Fusion bar for a few strong drinks before hitting the sack. It was there that I met two of the best bartenders/mixologists I've ever encountered-- Greg/Steven/Mulu. Those fellas know how to make a super strong drink. A little known fact about this bar is that they have four different type of concoctions that they prepare in-house and let them age for a couple weeks. They are in 4 big jars up on the display. Let me tell you, Greg offered me a taste of one (It's in one of my pictures)-- It was a mixture of Oranges, Mango slices, Pineapple, Vanilla Beans, and Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum. It's something like 80 proof, super strong, but what a grand taste it is going down your throat. Try it, you'll thank me later!. . One of the best features about The Palazzo is it's 'Plug N Play', which enables you to charge your Android/iPhone using your own USB cord. On the last night, I was charging my Galaxy Note 3, and had had a little too much to drink. I was playing the dollar slot machines and before long figured to stop while I was ahead, but forgot my expensive phone at the slot machine!! As I was about to get into the elevator up to the room, I noticed that I didn't have my phone on me. My heart dropped, and I dashed on over to where I had left it, only to notice that it was GONE! One of the casino workers noticed I was distraught and asked if I was alright. I explained what happened, and she told me to go over to security to see if someone had took it in. I went, and don't you know she was right! A security guard was walking up with my phone as I was walking up. I was happy that nobody snatched it, and that it ended in the right hands. They made me unlock it and sign a piece of paper, and away I went with my phone.. . All in all, a great experience at The Palazzo. Just yesterday I booked again for late September, to stay there again, with friends this time. Truly one of the gems on the strip.
Stayed here once or twice. Room is huge if comparing with other resorts in Las Vegas Blvd. 5/5* Feeling like a tourist, it was great even if I live here. Lol  We went to eat at an Asian restaurant near by the palazzo pit 5/5*, my friend ordered a dish of noodle for me and it was so delicious!
Hot damn. What a room. Or should I say suite? That's what they call them anyway, and I couldn't agree more. Step down living room, three TVs, window curtains that open with a remote control? Nicely designed and ideal location make it a great place to stay.. . On to the details:. - Again, huge room. Although I didn't this time, you could totally squeeze in quite a few people.. - Gym is small, but has all the basics.. - Very nice pool. I like that I can walk over to the Venetian pool as well. . - Good places to eat and shop.. . Definitely worth it! If you are an IHG member,  get your points!
Ask For an Upgrade. I was here for a board meeting and charmingly asked for a room upgrade & got it!** . I had been booked into a luxury king sweet but ended up with the 1,280-square-foot  SIENA SUITE! . . The Suite Life. The 2 room suite featured double doors opening to a long marble hallway which led to an expansive living room with a granite wet bar and a big flat screen TV. . . The adjoining bedroom was HUGE with a lovely king size bed,  the dressing alcove had a granite vanity leading into a gorgeous marble bath with a jetted tub and a stand up shower with multiple shower jets! Whew!  This suite is so big that If someone rings your doorbell (Yes, a doorbell for a hotel room!) while you're in the  dressing room, it takes a while to get that door! . . The SPA. The hotel offers great SPA which I enjoyed before our meeting started and it was the BOMB! The salt room is a must visit and there's also this trippy room where there's an ocean on the ceiling!  . . Room Service. Because I was here for a board meeting I didn't get out to the restaurants - but I did try the room service - and let me tell you, WOW! I ordered a cobb salad & french onion soup and my goodness - it was delish and the white glove service was amazing!. . I would definitely come back here! . . **(When checking into any hotel, it never hurts to ask for an upgrade!  How do I do it? I smile a genuine smile, look around the lobby & compliment something about the property, I say how happy I amto to be there & then I ask "Do you have any complimentary upgrades available?"  Or balcony room? . . If they don't have the avail rooms, then maybe ask for access to the club level where there's usually free nightly hors d'oeuvres, drinks, and a complimentary breakfast (bottles of free water are my fav perk!). . If they say no, just smile and shrug & say "Thanks for checking it never hurts to ask!"  They also may come back with an upgrade offer - say for $30  extra a night they can upgrade you to a better room - then you can decide...it's usually a bargain! A $159 a night room can be transformed to a $459 a night room for only $30 bucks? Yes please!
Where do I begin?.... . . I stayed here last week for my vacation, not at all what I expected the service and people are not worth the price.  They have no idea what customer service means, only the front desk do unfortunately.  If it weren't for the front desk I would give it 1 star only.. . I went to the concierge to ask for a great  Italian restaurant for lunch.  Unfortunately concierge recommended a restaurant they haven't eaten because the food was horrible you can read it from my other review Dal Toro, don't go there please. . . I went back to concierge after lunch to ask where can we sit since we are waiting to check in and it's not 3pm yet.  A lady told me there is no sitting area, we have to go to a cafe.  I thought this is odd, a big hotel like this no seating area. I can't bring my kid to the gaming area, this is why I need a place for her. I found at least 3 areas on my own, thanks for nothing... . . I got to my room, the cheese crumbs was still on the couch.  My hubby is nice enough to clean.  We had to wait 2 hrs for our luggage from the bell boys. REALLY!!! My husband had to call to ask them about it. . . We ended up sleeping in a comforter that was wrapped with a fitted sheet, which means no comforter cover and no sheets. We got hot at night and realized there was no sheets... The next day I asked a house keeper is it normal they don't provide sheets for the bed. It turns out my room wasn't clean.  Oh great mind you I took a bath and used the bathroom too. Now I am really disgusted.  . . The housekeeper told me he will talk to the manager for me. They offer to clean my room ASAP. It turns out the room was clean and the new sheets had stains on it. . . I had it and went to the front desk and told an associate of my dilemmas with the hotel. She apologized and comp me $75.  Really for how much crap I endured with my family $75 should be fine. I didn't really care at this point, I will never go back. . . The next house keeper changed the sheets and told me she couldn't give me new wine glasses and that I have to call priority desk. OMG! . . The rest of the time the guests that stay here are nicer than the staff.  The guests would  greet each other, but the staff don't greet you even when you talk to them.  It's like your inconveniencing them!!!. . The hotel is beautiful.  Next time I will only stay at the Wynn.
Don't stay here. The room was in poor condition upon check-in. The restroom smelled like someone took a massive dump. The sheet was stained red which I am hoping is from cranberry juice. Somebody's used cotton ball was on the sofa bench. What really brought me over the edge was seeing melted ice in our ice bucket. Absolutely disgusting.
Have stayed here 3 or 4 times over the last few years, including July 2014.  The rooms are amazing.....huge and nicely appointed with big bathrooms.  The pool is very nice.  Had drinks and food by the pool which were pricey for sure (2 drinks and a pizza over $60).  Also stayed a Venetian several times, which is equally as great.  We stayed at Venezia Towers once...walked a solid mile to the room, but the pool is awesome and private.  Tons of places to eat and shop.  The slots were much tighter this trip than in past trips.  But we always get our room comped (we play penny slots, but lots and lots of pennies!)
We stayed at the Palazzo for 3 days and 2 nights and it was such a great experience! We stayed in the Bella suite and the lady who checked us in was super sweet. I believe her name was Jennifer and she even gave us a free upgrade to the Bella suite with the Vegas strip view! The beds were so comfortable and the rooms were so clean! The Bella suite was nice because it was spacious and also had a separate bathroom with toilet from the shower. The service was great, they stocked us so well with towels and blankets, and asking for extra key cards or shampoo, or even blankets was so easy. . . They also had security at the entrance to the elevators. You had to show your room keys to get through. I loved that the Palazzo was linked with the Venetian. I went swimming in Venetian's lap pool in the mornings, it was great! . . Overall very good experience. I will definitely go back to this hotel! :)
My wife and I stayed here at the hotel on our most recent trip to Vegas. My wife loves the rooms here because it's big. You get two beds and a living area with an L couch. The rooms are nicely decorated and if you get a room with a good view, you can see the strip with all the lights at night. The rooms come with 2 flat screen TVs, one in the bed area and the other in the couch area. There's also a small TV in the bathroom.. . The casino itself isn't that big. They have slots and table games in the aisle way to the Venetian. Compared to the Venetian, the Palazzo casino area is pretty small. It seems like a lot of young people come stay at the Palazzo. They don't have a club or anything in the Palazzo but a few restaurants and the shops between the Palazzo and the Venetian.. . My wife attended the summer grazie gifts giveway. That was the second time I've been to that. It's a pretty nice event! It was located in one of the convention rooms. They give away gifts in exchange for points you've earned. They had a lot of samples on food to try. We also were able to take a complimentary picture that was really nice and included a nice little booklet to put the picture in. This event was for people who earned enough points to get gifts. This is a nice thing that they do for their players and was the reason why we stayed here during this trip.. . Overall, this casino/hotel is pretty nice. The rooms are big and good to share with a big group since there's 2 beds and also a couch area. I can't remember if it pulls out into a bed, probably not but I just can't remember since I never really use it. Gaming wise, the table stakes are pretty high. That's the only thing I don't like about staying here. The minimums are too high for me to want to play tables here. I'd rather stay at other hotels or probably would just walk to another casino to play since the minimums would be way less. But if you're with a big group, this place would be good for you.
Service was overall lacking.  Staff was generally rude/unhelpful/incompetent.. . The suite rooms were nice looking but kind of cheesy and the couch in the sunken living room was kind of gross (like it seemed impossible to clean).  . . The casino was not as nice as other hotels but not as cheesy as others.. . Kind of middle of the road hotel (which for the price seems like it should be better) with bad service.  . . Pool was okay--crowded not refreshing and slow pool service.. . Writing this review has been sad.
I have been to this resort on 2 separate occasions to stay.  The rooms are great, the staff is nice, the casino is fun, and the parking is relatively painless.  The location is pretty central to the strip which I love.  You are connected to the Venetian which has an awesome bar in the middle of everything that gets super weird at night.  They are very flexible with bookings and making sure you are accommodated.  The room service is delicious and prompt.  We love Vegas and we come very often.  There are a lot of awesome options to stay and Palazzo will stay on the list of "maybes".
This is a beautiful hotel not to mention its connected to the Venetian. I'm returning on a free trip with a beverage credit had a little fall nothing big so this is awesome. Ordered room service the shrimp scampi is delicious trust me chocolate cake had mousse with a light whip cream awesome
Had a great stay at the Palazzo hotel, the room was very nice.. I stayed in the Venetian the last time I was in Las Vegas. Purchased the spa package. The only thing I would do differently is to ask for my room to not be over the air conditioning units of the hotel/ Not a great view. So the next time I will request a better view, hopefully it wont be a  upcharge.. .  Also I was like the last room on a very Long Hallway. MIght want it closer to the elevator. Also when leaving to come home My pick up was at 4 am in the morning. I got down there earlier and it was very hot out the coolers that they have in the front were not on until day time. The package Canyon Ranch spa did not include spa usage for the whole time, they were going to charge me for each day. That doesnt seem right.
Oh, Palazzo. How I keep giving you the benefit of the doubt, but you just keep proving me right. For years that I've been going to Vegas, staying at the Palazzo has been nothing than an expensive headache and inconvenience that I question myself, WHY DO I KEEP BOOKING HERE ?!. . The rooms here are lovely. I love how they are all mini-suites, with plenty of space. Bathrooms are large with a separate shower and tub, and closed toilet. A large double sink vanity and a separate vanity for the girls to do makeup. There are sunken living room areas with a pullout and a sectional sofa. Two large TVS. A desk, plus table that sits 3. Plenty of electrical sockets for charging everything. The rooms are so accommodating, of course I want to stay here.. . HOWEVER, checking in is always a NIGHTMARE and no matter what, I am ALWAYS given wrong information from the front desk, that it just makes the stay frustrating. For example, last year our room was not availableuntil 6pm, in which they transferred my stay to the Venetian (even though I booked it at the Palazzo). And my past trip this past weekend was a nightmare. I originally booked MGM for Saturday for $180 (taxes and fees included). However, knowing check in was at 3pm and MGM was sold out Friday night and we were going to arrive late Friday night/early Saturday morning, I decided to book a stay for Friday-Sunday at the Palazzo for roughly $370 per night including taxes and resort fees. I called Palazzo to explain to them that we were coming from CA and we were driving, so our arrival time might vary. They assured me since the room was prepaid that we would have no problems checking in. Well thanks to the long 9 hour drive, we ended up getting to Vegas around 7am. Went straight to Palazzo hoping to get some shut-eye before heading out to Wet Republic, but once at the Front Desk, I learn that my reservations were cancelled, I "forfeited" the $370 for the first night, and our room will now not be available till 3pm, or whenever rooms become available... GREAT. They issued us keys and told us that they will give us a call once the room was available with the room number so we could just go straight to the room. The lady checking us in told us that we are more than welcome to use the Spa facilities to use the bathroom, shower, get ready, etc... or so we thought after lugging our luggage to the spa just to get rejected. We ended up changing in the bathroom and leaving our luggage in the car and headed out. Around 2pm I received a message from a lady from the Venetian front desk saying our suite was now ready. Great. Moving us to the Venetian (again!?) So we lugged our luggage from Palazzo to Venetian to find out, oh sorry, our room was at the Palazzo. Seriously !? And of course, no one at Front Desk took responsibility. No sorry. No anything. Just "I hope you enjoy your stay at the Palazzo and we hope to see you again!" You got to be kidding me. . . No, Palazzo, I don't ever want to stay here again, even though I love your rooms and I have the best luck at your casino. And yes, I want my money back. And YES, I am cancelling my reservations for this coming up October. And Yes, I will never recommend your hotel to anyone ever again. It's a shame, really.
Disappointed to say the service failed to impress.  As the saying goes, looks can be deceiving.  It is truly a gorgeous and ginormous hotel, impeccable at that, but their service level could definitely be improved.. . We checked in on a Friday night, and that went by fairly smoothly.  Fair warning though, it is a little bit of a walk from the check-in lobby to the elevators (if you don't travel light), otherwise it's a short walk across the casino.  . . As soon as we entered our room, we noticed there were no bath towels, no toothbrushes, and only two hand towels (even though we had booked the room for 4 people).  I guess they didn't have time to restock the room or our room was overlooked.  Either way, we decided to give the lobby a call and we requested extra towels, blankets, toothbrushes, and slippers, which they promised would be delivered within 30 minutes.  . . 40 minutes later....still waiting.... . 60 minutes later...still waiting.... . 80 minutes later...still waiting.... . We finally gave up and decided to call the lobby again.  After confirming our room #, we were told that the ticket order had already been closed because all of the requested items were delivered.  Honestly, I have no idea how that happened, seeing how we were just hanging out in our room the entire time and nobody knocked on our door or came in to deliver the so called amenities.  So they promised they would reopen the order and have it delivered on a "rush", meaning 15-20 minutes.  For the record, our items finally came 30 minutes later, bringing it to a total waiting time just shade under 2 hours.  Ridiculous.  . . But besides that whole ordeal, it's a really nice and posh hotel.  The rooms are spacious, comfy, and their curtains block out any sunlight for when you just need to crash when you get back into your room at 6 AM and sleep after a night out.. . It's also connected to the Venetian, and that is a whole other adventure in of itself.  If not for the minor hiccup with room service, it's one of the nicer (and newer) hotels on the strip!
My husband and I stayed here for a business trip. GORGEOUS and spacious room with a view of the Wynn through our window. I regret not going for a swim (silly me waits for a thunderstorm) as the pool area looked amazing. I believe there were two pools plus a hot tub. This hotel is attached to The Venetian which is really a site to see with "canal rides" and mimes and musicians near the restaurants. . . Only drawback was that the maps were very difficult to read. They not always had a "you are here" marker and the maps were unclear when switching floors.
7/28/14. . The Girl above review is Clue Less! Stayed 3 days with no problems? Not here both towers no power for 2 hrs and no internet for 15hrs but she gives 5 stars what a bunch if crap! I suggest you call hotel and asked them if all I said is true in the dates provided! You will se it's sucks! . . NO Power Generators! 1hr with out power and counting over 30 floors affected And No emergency lights?.. No Phone calls And lied about how long it will take! . . This is my review for this hotel it has power issue in all floors. I am in my room for a hour with 3,000 guest from our Mike Ferry conference no power in different floors at the palazzo we have suites and all floors lost power!. In the dark typing this, phone are cordless so no luck there except my suite has office with a reg phone so I called front desk they said its weather related sorry not our fault and generator will be up in a few minutes! We'll that was 1 hr ago, called back they said it's will be up shortly! . . ***** there is no way that any Generators in any hotel take 1 hr to turn on**** yes I am familiar with them they use gasoline or diesel! So this hotel does not have generators! Or forgot to buy gasoline???. . This is the worst experience from dirty rooms to no electricity in all floors I called on my cell phone and 15 of my partners in our conference have been waiting also, hotel says its a power storm they can't control! well it's not raining outside and the generators they can control! So they lied. . Do  not come to this hotel who cares about the free comps will get from this Stay it's just not worth it Mike Ferry should choose somewhere else to do business! Because this is not worth sitting at a conference for hours a day to come back to this crap! Stay at the Wynn hotel I can see From my room they have power! So not weather affected 7/28/14 I have to be here for 4 more days I don't know what will do now?.... Managers do not know what's to say except. Generator will be up shortly well it's now been 1 hr 10 minutes no power?... . . Update been 1hr 30 minutes no power . Palazzo has no emergency generators or emergency light can't wait for Nevada hotel commission to here of this unsafe issue. . No lights means you better watch your step in your room since they are steps and no lights if it wasn't for my ipad or phone you would fall break something on these steps!. . Shame on you!
7/28/2014: no power or air for more than an hour with temps soaring 100s. No internet for 12 hours even though they charge you resort fee. No eta on anything. Sometimes sorry doesn't cut it when you pay premium price for a room for comfort.
I love the smell of this hotel, I know I'm weird. They have huge rooms (suites) and I love how they have a vanity in the bathroom. The Palazzo is very similar to The Venetian which I stayed both in the past. The Palazzo is better than Aria in my opinion. I would pick to stay in The Palazzo out of all the hotels in Vegas.
