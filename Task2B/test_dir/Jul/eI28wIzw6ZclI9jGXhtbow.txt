I'm not uptight and I can take a joke, but I attended sober.  The problem with this show was the poor execution of the "jokes."  This was all high school level, with baby-talk from the Penny character to boot.  I wasn't offended; I just wasn't entertained... But... Someone should tell Jonah Hill and Justin Bieber that they didn't have to apologize on CNN for their homophobic and racist slurs while "we" decide if society is going castigate or overlook these drunken celebrity slips whilst concurrently paying for and praising these pieces of "entertainment" that are designed to be much more offensive.  The only reason the way overpriced show doesn't get a "dead dog" is due to some of the memorable performances.  Was there an attempted story line within the acrobatics?  I remember a lesbian erotica thing going on and the overweight wife/girlfriend across from me elbowing her husband/boyfriend for looking and grinning.  (It didn't really work if that's what they were going for.). . The space is intimate and there really isn't a bad seat, but honestly I think some of the performers need more room for more tricks.  The circle tends to get monotonous and limiting after a few minutes.. . The burlesque performer is apparently well known in the New York scene.  She had a unique voice that reminded me somewhat of French artist Jane Birkin and was pleasant to look at (though burlesque isn't really my thing).. . Worth $100?  No.  (My party got a deal for 60; still not worth that ticket price.) Some of the acts are amazing, but I would go to Cirque de Soleil for the contortion and acrobatics.  But they need a serious rewrite in between the acts, and honestly for everyone who says this is the best show in Vegas? "The emperor is wearing no clothes."
Sex. Racism. Foul language. If any of these things offend you, then Absinthe is not for you. This intimate, alternative Cirque-style production takes place inside a beautifully decorated tent outside the Caesars Palace lobby. . . The 90-minute show is hosted by a slimy, foul mouthed barker who has no problem making fun of every race, religion, political bent and sexual preference in the crowd. His comic relief is his even more raunchy and politically incorrect "sister" who does things with hand puppets that makes Avenue Q look like a kid's show.. . Like Cirque, you get feats of strength, balance, and dexterity on the trapeze, high wire, and a rotating and telescoping stage - but unlike Cirque, it's delivered with sensuality, comedy, and in extreme close-up (the audience sits in a circle around a small central stage).. . Tickets for the show originally sold in the $40-$50 range, but box office prices are closer to $120 now and Tix4Tonight has them for $90, which still seems pricey for such a small scale production. (In contrast, the least desirable seats for large scale Cirque shows now start at $55, but you'll need binoculars and won't laugh at all.). . If you can afford it, Absinthe invites you into a beautiful space where you'll see and hear things you have never seen or heard onstage and enjoy some amazing performers and edgy humor. . . I loved it! Just don't bring your parents or children!
Absinthe was probably the highlight of my weekend in Vegas (other than winning $160 at the airport penny slots - Yes, PENNY). The atmosphere was very fun, the comedy hilarious and raunchy, and the physical acts were so intense that my buddy kept screaming, "Holy SHIT!" over and over again. . . Skip the premade popcorn they sell in the tent - it only makes your hands salty and gets in the way of the alcohol absorption.
A GREAT Adult show!  If you are offended by racist and sex jokes this is not for you.. I will start off with what I did not like and these are MINOR issues.  The seats could be a bit more comfy for the $120 price I am paying.  They are only simple regular folding chairs.  Also the green girl sidekick was a bit annoying.  But again these are minor issues!. . The tent has that vintage circus style that I love.  There were so many amazing acts!  Especially with a small setting like this, you can see everything close!. . Also they let you take photos!  i was surprised because every show I go to they said no pics!. . This is one of the shows you gotta see if you are in Vegas! I know the price is steep but think about it, you lose more in gambling anyway! LOL!
If you only see one show in Vegas, see this one! . . Word of warning, the seating is basically a bunch of fold-up chairs. Very uncomfortable and no elbow room. Upgrade to premium seating! You'll get a comfy seat in the back of the tent. It's a small venue so don't worry, you still have a great view of the action.
Loved the show, the highlight of my trip, if you don't have an open mind, don't go it is a great mix of nestalga, comedy(crudely hilarious), sarcasim and great acrobatics. I am stingy with my money, and it was well worth the price.
Wow! Everything and more. Yes, it's vulgar (and hilarious), but the acts are amazing and you're so close. Forget cirque, see this!!!
Truly is one of my Favorite shows ever. Penny and Gaz make the show what it is.  You will laugh more in 5 mins than you have your entire life.  Well worth the $$$.  If you are offended by crude and dirty language this is NOT the show for you.  The Acts are all quite amazing and you will have an awesome time.  Enjoy.
Great show, really funny vulgar humor that I like. All seating is good, the trapeze, strong men and shit talking is great! Must see show!
This is a show in the Spiegel tent in Caesar's Palace. First of all it's amazing that it's a tent. Well it's a tent from the outside but inside it just looks like a 1920s Parisian showroom. It's fantastic. I get the vibe they're going for but I have to tell you because of this very specific vibe the chairs are rickety old folding chairs and they are rely uncomfortable so be forewarned before you go in. Also they are zip tied together so there is no space. The seating could be a lot better. Because of the way it's set up your on the same level as the people in front of you so you're looking at their giant heads in your way while you're trying to see the action in the center. With that said the rest of the show is absolutely fantastic.  It opens with an acrobat who balances on about 1 million chairs and then you're introduced to the green fairy of absinthe.  She's beautiful and has a beautiful voice and you get to see a lot of her body throughout the show. Then you meet the gazillion air and his assistant and they are hilarious. Be ready for racist sexist jokes.   Also be ready if You are nerdy white black Asian gay lesbian you will become the butt of his jokes but it's funny. The amazing acrobatic acts are fantastic. You would think maybe a little cliche for Vegas but not. They have totally different acts and I've seen all the Cirque du Soleil's this is different!!  It is really difficult to find discount tickets for the show but it is worth the kind of high price.  A must see for Vegas
I liked the show but the people that worked there ruined the experience for me.  Performers were fabulous but staff were rude and made me not enjoy the experience. Aisle staff should not be so rude.
My ladyand I have gone twice now. Wow, the show was even funnier the 2nd time maybe cuz we were asked if we wanted a table. We paused for a min cuz we have been to this show b4. But of course we said hell yeah -beats the hell outta those wooden chairs. Not sure why we were asked if we wanted a table. I was thinking cuz we bought pricy drinks outside or cuz I'm white and my lady is Hispanic. Thought jokes would fly our way but none/Either way wouldn't have cared. Gotta go to this show open minded and have a sense of humor. Lil pricy but worth it. Never a full moment. Will be back.
AMAZING. quite possibly the best how i've ever seen and i have seen a LOT of shows. the only thing is, it's VERY RAUNCHY. VERRRRY RAUNCHY. definitely not a show you want to watch with your parents, children, or church friends. they will most definitely roast the audience members. it's every sort of politically incorrectness thrown in your face. BUT it's not just that. all of that is seamlessly woven into breathtaking acrobatics. the venue is quite intimate so there are no "bad seats." it's a great time!!
Seen a ton of Cirque shows and they were all great, but this is a nice twist.  Really up close in the tent style, so you see everything.  The acts are all outstanding!  The aded raunchy comic duo is what made this so over the top awesome.  You don't just leave amazed, but you had laughed your butt off as well.  Very not-PC, so beware if you can't handle reality and only want a world of fluffy unicorns and cotton candy..... the chairs suck, as other reviewers have mentioned, but such a good showit still gets 5 stars!  A must see if you are headed to Vegas soon.
SHORT VERSION: OMG my cheeks hurt from laughing!. . LONG VERSION: Let me say that other Yelpers are right. This show is in no way politically correct. If you can leave your qualms at the door, this is one of the best show in Vegas. Amazing acrobatic performers and a ton of humor. The hostess Penny is a total riot. You'll leave with a smile on your face.
AMAZING! The acts and environment are incredible! The host, the Gazillionare, and Penny Pibblets are hilarious and very witty! If you don't like vulgar jokes and language then this is probably not the show for you! If you sit it the front row you will definitely get picked on! Overall it's a fabulous show! The talent is incredible!
This show is the perfect adult night out in las vegas. The show is raw and not for the sensitive. The jokes are adult and they don't hold back. The physical performances in the show are at the same level of CDS shows here in las vegas. A couple of other acts were sexy but not dirty which gave the show a good overall feel. The only thing I can give everyone a tip on is the seating. Your butt will hurt after 90 minutes at the show unless you sit in the back. They have old cast iron bath tubs with cushions and barber chairs. The view doesn't look that great from back there but it's available. It really doesn't matter on the comfort; the show is unique and very fun. I have to admit that I've never witnessed a woman (Penny) use that many F Bombs on stage. It was great.
Very entertaining. Dirty raunchy humor, don't go if you are uptight. Loved the jokes at the audience expense. It was funny. I did not like sitting on a hard folding chair though.
+. This show is totally F.O.O.C (Fuking Out Of Control). Adult Sexual Content! Unbelievable Acts and Awesome Tastless Humor. Intimate (only a total of 4 rows) and Authentic Decor. Not for Prude, Uptight and Non-Open Minded People!. Best Show in Las Vegas!
One of my favorite shows on the strip.  Not for the kids!  I've seen the show 4 times now and laugh 'til tears every time.  The talent for the show is excellent and they put on a great show.  The feats they do are great.  Seating is close to the stage regardless of your seat location.  Be prepared to be potentially picked out of the audience and ridiculed (it's all in good fun).  RECOMMENDED!!!  The jokes are (extremely) crude, but it had the crowd rolling and I loved it.  If this is the modern version of the circus, then I'm headed to the big tent again and again!!!
