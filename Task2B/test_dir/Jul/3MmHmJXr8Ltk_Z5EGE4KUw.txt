Great atmosphere and awesome steak house. Waiter was very knowledgeable on their steaks and it was one of the best steaks I ever had. It's very expensive restaurant but it's definitely worth it.
The beef cheeks ravioli was the highlight of the meal -- the chop salad was just okay, and I make a better ribeye at home on our grill, unfortunately.  Still a really nice restaurant, but for $400 for two people, I would have wanted it to be a very memorable steak.
We had an absolutely fabulous dinner here. And our expectations at a Mario Batali restaurant, at the Venetian-Palazzo, and in Vegas in general, were high to say the least. Appetizers were calamari and bruschetta with house made burrata and squash were awesome. Definitely the star of the show was the ricotta and egg raviolo in brown butter. Three out of four of us ordered it and they were FANTASTIC. yolk broke into the sauce and the pasta was nice and thin. Perfection. Honestly this was rich enough i wouldn't have needed the seafood spaghetti I ordered, even though it was tasty and very generous with the seafood. Other entrees at the table included the game hen which she liked a lot, too. Service was almost perfect, took the waiter too long to ask if we wanted the check given how likely it was we needed to leave and make a show (which we did). But more importantly the waitstaff has obviously been very well trained. They do not push food on you and they advise you how most people order (most people split a pasta and split a steak, etc.) even though it might not benefit the overall bill total for him. Fantastic evening.  Highly recommend as long as you have the budget.
Wow the dry-aged ribeye for 2 was amazing along with the lamb chops.  Ribeye was very tender, moist and flavorful.  Lamb chops were the best I've ever had - they kept the fat caps on so it was very fatty, juicy, and also flavorful and sweet (though my mom thought they were too fatty but I thought that was the best part).  For 3 people this was more than enough food.  We almost couldn't finish it all with a side of roasted beets which was also very yum.  Be prepared to spend some $$$ as the ribeye for 2 was $72/person and the lamb chops alone was $63.  I think you can easily get either the ribeye or lamb chops and share a pasta or appetizer to compliment.  Great selection of wine as well.  Would definitely come back!!
The wait staff is clumsy and had difficulties serving our party of sixteen. Plates were mistakenly placed. There was a significant lapse of time between appetizers and main courses. But what was really appalling was the kitchen forgetting someone's riserva steak. When I say "forget," I don't just mean they sent it out a few minutes late. I mean we all finished eating by the time it came out. And then during dessert, they forgot that same person's coffee! . . My entree was made up of two sides: Scallops A La Piastra and Italian Broccoli. The scallops had good presentation, but were cold. The broccoli was something just thrown into the dish, hanging out the side, etc. . . The service, plating, and food are not worth $$$$.
Fantastic cocktails, service, lots of thoughtful complimentary tidbits offered through dinner, and an AMAZING 3 month aged ribeye.  The background music did take me off guard, but I have to say it doesn't detract.  Truly, the service was fantastic.  This place deserved better than 3.5 stars.
This restaurant is good but really not worth the price. I had the New York strip. It was tough.
A very sophisticated wine selection with real trained sommeliers.   The food paired deliciously from a great chef, and the waiters are top of the line.. . I had the dry aged beef which was well worth every penny.   I didn't spare any expense as I was taking my father-in-law .  It was his 1st trip to Las Vegas.  Appetizers,  French onion soup, Ceasar salad, sides,  dessert and espresso. . . $800 with wine. . . Memories are made here.
My fiance and I were here for dinner last week, as we are looking for a place to have a nice dinner reception following our small wedding in a few months, annnnd.... . I'm sorry, but if I'm spending $60+ on a steak, I expect to get it how I ordered it. I should have read Yelp reviews beforehand, but if their version of "medium" is code for "still breathing", they should let guests know. . . Service was great, and everything else would have probably made me want to go back for more, but...no.
My steak was great, but my wife's pasta came out underdone and the waitress felt like having a 20 minute conversation with another table instead of fixing the problem. When we asked that this be corrected the bread came out cold and the drinks were never refilled.
I love Carnevino. My partner and I are huge Mario fans. Both times I've been in Las Vegas I've made sure to visit. Our first experience in 2008 or 2009 was amazing (5 stars). Great waiter who helped us find the perfect wine for our meals. He was by far the best waiter I've ever had. The filet and steak tartar just blew me away. This year, I went to Carnevino after having a meal at Cut (I had the Waygu beef so I know it's not a fair comparison). The waiters at Carnevino were less friendly this time-younger and seemed less experienced. They were a little snobby, which is really unfortunate. The meal was great but it did not blow me away like the first time. We accidentally received wedges  instead of greens (which they kindly gave us for free because of the mix up). I remember the dry texture of the wedges and for some reason that's what I taste when I think of Carnevino, and that makes me sad. . . I don't have pity for the reviewers that said their beef was undercooked. Steak should be served medium-rare and if you don't like it that way, I think you should eat your steak at home. Haha.
A group of 10 of us came here for a friend's birthday and we were treated with exceptional service. The service here is definitely not lacking and not an issue whatsoever.. . They ran out of braised short ribs even though we had dinner reservations super early before the restaurant even got remotely packed. This was really disappointing to the group of us that ordered the dish.. . I thought the Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare was just A-OK, but nothing special. The dish came with plenty of seafood, which was great, but the pasta was just too hard for my taste. . . My boyfriend absolutely loved the beef cheek ravioli. It is one of their specials, so don't except to find it on their menu. The mascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes were AMAZING! Definitely recommend it and the desserts were all yummy. Can't really go wrong with any of them.. . Overall...I thought dinner was A-OK, but I won't go out of my way to come back.
This place is amazing!!! Truly the best steakhouse west of the Mississippi!!! What makes this place so great is not only the food but the atmosphere. The staff was seamless and all were knowledgable about the menu. I enjoyed that the menu wasn't traditional, there was steak but the eggplant side and the beet side was to die for. Layers of flavor that were amazing. Will be back again and again!
My friends and I decided we would go to one of the top rated restaurants one night during our trip for this past teachers conference. The only thing about this place that was exceptional was the server Albert. he was very friendly and funny, making us feel comfortable.  however the other server John acted as if he could not be bothered with our table and really was just rushing us out and then had the audacity to request 20% from our party of 5. . The food is overrated, for a $50 filet it had very little flavor everything was overpriced even for Vegas. We have no intention of going again.
I've been here three times now and always come away impressed, though I have to say my recent third visit was a little less impressive than the first two. The first time I came, I had the NY Strip and it was, without a doubt, the best steakhouse beef I've ever had. The second time I had the filet at the bar and it was also delicious. This time, a buddy and I made our own surf and turf, as he got the NY Strip and I got the seafood pasta and we shared. The steak was not as good as the first two times. Oh, it was still good, it just wasn't GREAT like the first couple. The seafood pasta was nice, but a couple of bits of the lobster were tough and I was hoping for more spice. I will give them major props for the octopus appetizer, which was hands down the best octopus I've ever had. Incredibly tender and with rich flavor from a superb limoncello marinade. Batali has a way with the eight-tentacled creature, because the second-best octopus I've ever had was at the B&B over in the Venetian. Another person at the table got the three double-cut lamb chops and it was enormous almost to the point of being ridiculous. I mean, this was not Mary's little lamb--this was a monster. As some others have mentioned, the sauces here are entirely extraneous and unnecessary. For the vast majority of dishes, the regular preparation is plenty of seasoning. The sides were hit and miss. The hit was the spinach with garlic and hot pepper, which was a cool take on steakhouse spinach, being something other than creamed. The mascarpone mashed potatoes, though, were the sorriest excuse for mashed potatoes ever placed in front of me at a steakhouse. I'd say they tasted like instant, except that would be an insult to instant. I really hope it was just an off night for the potato chef. . . Service and pacing were on point, as you would expect from these owners in this location.. . Couple of other notes: When we ordered the NY Strip medium-rare, we were told, "Our medium-rare is more like rare." Huh? Isn't this thing supposed to be somewhat standardized? I mean, if it's "more like rare", then call it rare and stop confusing people who went to Double Helix and had two pear winetinis before dinner.. Also, this restaurant is huge. (I guess it would have to be, just to store the lamb chops.) But I mean really, I believe there are Palazzo guestroom bathrooms that are closer to the tables than the one in the restaurant. Plan ahead and start walking when you sort of have to tinkle; don't wait until you REALLY have to tinkle.
This place is not for everyone and that is OK.. . I really enjoyed my 100 day dry aged ribeye, and the other items I ordered.. . I think this place gets unfairly knocked for the following reasons:. . It's an Italian Steakhouse.  They don't do 14 sauces or Emeril Laggase style spice rubs.  They take amazing beef, season it with some restraint and cook it beautifully.  Some people will not like beef as the star, they like more going on with their steaks and that's fine but that's not what Carnevino does. I see Carnevino's steaks as the margherita pizza of steaks, simple, beautiful, and tasty.. . Secondly It's pricey, so if anything is not to someones personal liking they are more upset due to the price.. . The last reason I think people knock this and other good steakhouses is because they offer some boring vegetable side dishes. Some people like fresh, simple veg with their steak.  If that's not you don't order the broccoli. Order some cheesy or creamy side if you want rich and savory on top of rich and savory.. . Service was top notch, friendly, and informative, not stuffy or intimidating.. . If you have some extra coin, give it a try.  I had an amazing meal there.. . I hope this review turns some people away from going to Carnevino  because it's not good for people to spend their money on something they don't care for and it's not good for Carnevino to get bad reviews from people who come to eat there wanting something that they don't offer.
How could one not be a fan of Carnevino?! It's amazing! The food was excellent, the service was excellent, and the drinks were flowing. . . If you find yourself in Vegas craving a really good piece of meat, and have an overflowing wallet, this is the place to go! While the prices were a little high for my tastes, our traveling buddies wanted to take us here. We definitely enjoyed our meal, by far it was amazing. I sampled things I hadn't before, and it was all around enjoyable. The service was excellent, many different servers stopped by our table for different things, and each was extremely professional and friendly. . . I absolutely loved the corn side dish, it was by far my favorite. I also LOVED the potatoes with the egg (who woulda thunk?), that was amazing. The steak was great, if you have the budget to spend.
I'm only giving them 2 starts because if you're not a cowboy, you won't be welcomed. The food gets 5 stars, but after our experience I believe there exists racial discrimination from the wait staff towards the customer. And that does not bode well for an overall dining experience. IF I eat there again, I'll order take out.
