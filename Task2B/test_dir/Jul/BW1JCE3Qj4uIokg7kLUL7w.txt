4 out of 5 stars mainly for the service. Everyone was very attentive, asking how we were doing, refilling our water, giving us more bread (sourdough and some sort of onion bread).. . Tips:. - We ordered the ribeye and told them we would be sharing. They will split everything (vegetables, steak, etc.) for you without an additional cost. Nicer restaurants typically do this for their customers, but some will charge a fee. . - My dad asked for Tabasco sauce with his pasta (I know, kinda weird), and they gave us a handful of cute travel-size Tabasco bottles to use and take home with us. Now, my dad can conveniently have hot sauce with him at all times.
I thought this restaurant was amazing. Before I get to the food, the service was really considerate and attentive even though I was with a rather large party. A few of us were cashing in their myVEGAS rewards and it went through without any hassle. The staff and their friendly attitude already set us in a good mood.. . Without further ado, the food was A+. For the appetizers, I was able to try a bit of the tuna tartare and that was delicious. The flavors blended together so nicely that I wished I had my own order. . . As for the entrees, I had the grilled salmon and frankly, it was one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had. It was seared beautifully; the outside was crisp while the inside was slightly undercooked. I also got to try my friend's Ribeye (great) and the Linguini with grilled shrimp (as a pasta lover, this was very good). Moreover, I tried Brussel sprouts for the first time here and I couldn't stop eating it!. . Overall, I felt that this restaurant was worth the hype. Everything, from the food to the service, was on point. I would definitely dine here again if I'm back in Sin City.
I came here twice during my three night stay at the MGM...needless to say, I was a fan! The first night we splurged on an excellent salmon dish, prepared perfectly and complimented with a fresh garden salad and brussels sprouts (without the bacon). The service was excellent and I enjoyed the not too loud environment. The second time we went mainly because many of the other restaurants had closed (who knew places closed at 10pm in Vegas!?), but it was an equally great meal! I was happy to go back, but obviously on such a short trip we had hoped to try other restaurants. This time we shared a salad and pizza, I made my half veggie and my friend had chicken on hers. We both ate all of our slices and left feeling great for the evening ahead! If you can splurge definitely try a seafood dish, and if you are feeling a little more financially reserved, the pizzas are a great and filling option. . Enjoy :)
Came to eat here because hakkasan line was wayyy too long and I didn't want to wait. Plus we wouldn't have made it in time for guestlist.. We got wings as an appetizer and they were pretty good! Crispy yet juicy.. My man got the spaghetti pasta which was delicious!! The sauce to meat ratio was perfect! He wasn't able to finish it all. . I got the burger with fries. The fries were so crispy and good! I was only able to finish half of my meal so we got a togo box and had a delicious midnight snack. . Overall the dining expletive was okay. Our waiter only checked up on us once...
For Vegas, the pricing is pretty decent. A little less than $20 for a very nice burger. I ordered a medium rare burger and it came out ever so slightly overdone, but still very juicy and embarrassing to eat. Everyone I dined with (5 people) was pleased with their meal. Others ordered pizza, soup, pasta and a panini. Nothing was "the best ever" but it was all solidly very good, and reasonably priced for lunch. Service was great too. Polite without being condescending.
5 stars for food, and one star for service. Our waitress was horrible! She came to us without saying anything expect "are you ready to order?" Never checked on us expect towards the end to bring the check. The busser was pretty much our server. Left a 18% tip only because of the busser.
Just had the sweet corn soup. Omg. Yum!!!!!. I will order that again next time I come here.
My partner and I came here as a "last resort" due to our late check-in to MGM, it was a Thursday night and quarter to midnight so a lot of the nearby fine-dining restaurants were closed and we definitely didn't feel like fast food.. . Although it was late there was a wait list for seating (4th July does tend to get pretty packed) but we were seated within five minutes and had drinks almost immediately after sitting down.. The menu is extensive and all of the meals sound delicious! I had the grilled Salmon and my boyfriend had the meatballs and we were definitely not disappointed- absolutely delicious. Another high point of our experience was the attentiveness and overall awesome of the servers, very knowledgeable, friendly and prompt. . It was such a fantastic experience and I definitely recommend Wolfgang Puck to everyone who likes excellent food and great service!
I'm pretty leery of celebrity chain restaurants. We ate here sort of on a whim and I was absolutely delighted that we did. The Chinese Chicken Salad was one of the best salads I've ever had. The cheeseburger was one of the best burgers I've ever had. I've been a lot of places all over San Fran, LA, Vegas, and NYC. I'm not exaggerating. Our meal was dang good. VERY reasonably priced for Vegas. Will definitely be returning on subsequent visits to Vegas.
In MGM hotel, right in front of CDS' Ka Theatre. At 10pm, there was no line, so was seated immediately. Menu is small, about 6-8 appetisers, mains, desert. I ordered the spicy tuna tatare (About $20, very good) and a mushroom pizza (about $18, thin crust, light and delicious). Servers were professional and attentive. Hostess was aloof and rolled her eyes at me (unconscious, I hope, and I am generally thick-skinned about such things). Dinner was Thurs, 10 July.
Beautiful tomato caprice. Excellent wine selection. Extremely noisy and set on the main path to the parking deck. Service is impeccable!
We have been here for over an hour and our food isn't even here... They took 30 minutes to take out order... We haven't left because we are very hungry otherwise we would leave and go somewhere else .
Came here with the family to grab something to eat while staying at the MGM. We ordered the calamari and the linguine pasta with shrimp. The food was good and the prices are decent for Vegas. I could honestly say, this was one of the tastiest place we dined in Vegas and will definitely be back.
I ate here because I had no other choice.. . Wandered around the MGM grand and couldn't find the exit (sober). Looped around this place and I'm like... listen it's late, just get some food.. . Food wasn't bad, got some pasta and shrimp. The beer was better and service was alright. I slept with a full belly.
By far one of my top 5 favorite restaurants ever. The food selection is great even for a vegetarian! The creme brulee and gluten free pasta are to die for. Even the water tastes great. The atmosphere and staff are wonderful too. I always eat here when im in Vegas
YUMMY!!!!!  My husband and I LOVE this restaurant!  EVERY TIME we go to Vegas or Los Angeles we always make it a point to come to this restaurant.. . First up are their wings.  My husband LOVES them.  They are always cooked to perfection.  The flavor is great!  He orders them whenever we visit.. . Next up is the chicken salad sandwich on cherry pecan bread.  Talk about delicious!!  The bread's flavor is very unique.  Always nice and fresh.  The chicken salad is just as good as the bread.  Best chicken salad I have ever had.. . Italian sausage wood oven pizza: EXCELLENT.  Very good.  Flavor is very different from what regular pizza joints have to offer.  . . Finally, my absolute favorite, the free range chicken breasts with yukon potato puree.  The chicken is absolutely huge (and I do mean HUGE) but it is always cooked to please.  It is so tender & juicy it just melts in your mouth.  Now, I do have to admit, the 1st time I went to the restaurant I was like, what the heck is yukon potato puree.  That sounds so nasty, but to my surprise it was great!  Very flavorful!  . . I would recommend this restaurant to everyone looking to have a great meal.  Yeah, it's a little expensive, but it's Vegas baby.  What do you expect?
Stopped by this restaurant for a late dinner.  This restaurant is very open with views of the casino atmosphere and people walking by as you eat.  It was pretty busy for late at night and the service was very quick.  We only wanted a quick bite to eat so we split the salad and it was a good portion to share.  The offer sparkling or tap water like most  fine dining restaurants.  It is a relatively affordable dining option but Vegas overall is going to be pretty expensive so just be aware.
3.5 stars is precisely what I would give this wolfgang puck restaurant.  its located in the restaurant section of the mgm. I tried to make a reservation for sunday night and it was all booked up, monday lunch seeemed easy to get right in. . the ambiance was casual dining. our waiter was attentive and recommended  good dishes. I tried a little bit of everyones entree at my table . I split the halibut, which I though was perfectly cooked and a good size for two to eat. my friends got seafood pasta, which perhaps could of had more cheese. another dish we tried was the leek soupe and classic calamari appetizers. :). overall a good dining experience, my only complaint is that its great for groups, but not very private or intimate being that there were no windows where we sat. you cohld pretty much catch conversations from random bystanders in the casino walking by.
One of the best meals I have had in Vegas! Both the service and food was absolutely amazing! Special thanks to our server Brayden!
My boyfriend and I were given a Wolfgang Puck gift card, and found out there was one in the MGM where we were staying. When making the reservation, the hostess asked us if we were celebrating anything. I informed her that we were celebrating our 3 year anniversary and that we were in a long distance relationship.. . When we were seated and brought our menus, I was so surprised. At the top of their menu, they had "Happy 3rd Anniversary" printed on the top. Yes it was something small, but it meant a lot to me. We both ordered the linguini pasta with shrimp and it was amazing. We ended with creme brulee for dessert and it was delicious.. . The wait staff was great and we never had to really wait for anything to come to our table or for our drinks to be refreshed.. . Thank you for making our anniversary dinner so great!!!
