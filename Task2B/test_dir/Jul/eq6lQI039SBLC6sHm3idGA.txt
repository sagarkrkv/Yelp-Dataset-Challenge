Look up a review by Jennie M. She sings high praises for this place. I cannot say the same. I am a firm believer that one review or one bad day should be the only thing to base the value of a venue on. So to those ends and the countless positive reviews I will share my opinion without too much judgement.  Just a declaration of my experience the one day, the one time I tried it. By the time we went to find this place it was well know so there wasn't much secret but who can really keep secrets on the Internet?  The pizza was lacking flavor,  over cooked and bland.  There was little more personality than a prison lunch line and I left feeling it should have remained a secret. The experience did not live up to the hype.  Given the other reviews it might be worth giving them a second chance.
Yes it's expensive. You're on The Strip! Yes, they reheat the pizza. That's how you get the crispy crust. Apparently the people who wrote those reviews have never had NY style pizza before and forgot where they were.... . Here's the deal. Is it the best pizza you'll ever have? Depends on where you are from and if it's NY or NJ then the answer is NO! If you are from the west coast then maybe. The pizza is hot, gooey, crispy and hits the spot especially when it's late and you need some food. It's definitely not the best pizza I've ever had. The pizza is slightly too salty and one dimensional. You don't get that slight sweetness of the tomatoes in the good pizza sauce from NY/NJ. Yes it was greasy. Whatever, just use the napkin dabbing trick to remove the grease! You will not get any pizza better than this around here unless you drive to Settebello.
Rolling with 5 stars here because if you want pizza at 3 or 4am and stumble on THIS place, this is genius; you will be a very happy camper.  If this were on the corner in your town, probably 4 stars.. . Walking into this place, we half-expected the small crowd to turn with a welcoming cheer, like, "you made it into our club!"  We felt like the Coors Light ice climbers were about to pop up with 2 beers for our hidden party.  . . It was almost comical...but also super simple.  The counter where we order suggested the Pizza Re-heater Guy might belt out a "No pizza for you!" if we strayed from any specific club parlance.   . . This was like a bonus while staying at Cosmopolitan.  If we weren't staying there, I'd definitely have walked down the strip late night for a slice or two.  Or three.
A little pricy for a slice of pizza. This locationis on the strip. $5.25 for a good size pizza is ok. They re-heat the pizza for you. Definately this place isnt easy to find. I will come back again soon.
Forgot my pizza order. Waiting 30+ minutes for it. Then proceeded to be chill about it. Not okay.
Came here for my morning hangover. Had a "ballast point" beer in my hand and the guy behind the counter recognized it! Wearing a white t shirt with a hat that said "original". Great customer service I feel bad I didn't have cash and only tipped a $1 because it wasn't until after I tipped he started talking. Also another dude with tats who serviced us and was super kind. They had the right amount of energy to deal with a hungover couple and still provided great conversation! I tried to offer him some of my beer as I just opened it but he refused... If I had a extra one in my room I would bring it down for when he is off his shift! Lol. This place really is a hole in the wall but exceeded my expectation! Props to your beer knowledge!!! Hope you make mad tips and get some hot chicks numbers!
Had to try because everyone talked about it. Third floor so wasn't too hard to find. Big slices for $4-5 bucks. Got the white and wasn't bad. Kind of cold but who doesn't like cold pizza. Very garlicky but tasty. Make sure you have a drink. Was lucky & not a huge line, but if you want a whole pizza order ahead of time. Not bad for a late night snack
Got off of the plane, found my friend (a local), claimed my luggage, and then were off to Secret Pizza for lunch!  Hidden away on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, completely unmarked, down a long photo covered hallway, Secret Pizza is a heavenly find.  Here, you can buy full pizzas or slices.  Since we were just having lunch, my friend and I both ordered slices and a soda.  Choosing from the options on hand, I got two slices of meatball and ricotta.  They were AMAZING!  Thin, perfectly crispy crust, with ample portions of sliced meatball and ricotta blotches, and just the right amount of sauce in between.  Make your selection and the guy behind the counter cuts your slice and places it in the oven to reheat and crisp up, giving you a beautifully hot, melty slice of pizza goodness!
After living in Chicagoland for over 35 years, I can say this is some tasty pizza. I've been here several times after moving to Las Vegas and I can not stray away from the white pizza. Garlicky and cheesy goodness. . . Their pan pizza is mislabeled as Chicago deep dish. A big chunk of dough with cheese on top. At $8 a slice, it's a joke. I recommend buying two thin slices instead. . . Service is spotty, but what can you expect after serving hordes of drunk tourists for hours on end. A great late night snack on the Strip. Savor the flavor.
Good pizza. Definitely for the drunks and those with the munchies this is your place to go.  10 slices of pizza with pepperoni,  sliced sausage and mushroom for a little over $30. I love coming here.  Due expect a long line after 2AM
Looking for a cheap, amazing, and quick food! This is the place to be! I love this place the pizza taste like something you would get from the east coast. It was the cheapest dish I've ever eaten in Vegas, and one of the most fulfilling.. I ordered the sausage pepperoncini & ricotta pizza. The crust was so amazing, and the pizza toppings were awesome! I forgot what else I ordered on the ricotta pizza, because I was to busy eating away. . This place is especially perfect after your partied your butt off and need a perfect pizza to hit the spot!
It wasn't worth the hype.  I don't like ricotta so not a fan of the famed white pizza.   Pepperoni was just ok.
You'll definitely miss this if there wasn't a line coming out into the hallway. I'm craving their garlic powder. Sprinkled it all over my big slice of pizza and it made it 10x better. Always more reasonable to buy the pie rather than a slice, but we all wanted different things, so we paid a little more for a slice. It's open super late which is a huge perk for people coming out of Marquee.
It is not that you're super drunk & that's why their pizzas taste so dang delicious because the second time I came here I was not as intoxicated as my first visit... And I'm drooling as I type this... But OMG their white pizza is........ Out of this world. Believe the  hype!!!! And yes there are no signs directing you this place so remember it's on the third floor near the escalators. The only way we found it the first time was because a kind sir, an employee of Cosmo (a fine gentleman I might add), took our look of confusion & eagerness as the same exact look he has come too familiar with; the look of the many who have come before us- the lost, confused, anxious, & HUNGRY Secret Pizza first timers!! Lol. You must must must come and try this place if you're in Vegas because you will not be disappointed. You will want to tell everyone you know just like I have been doing ever since!
Ok, stop the presses. Yes, as a New Yorker, I can tell you the pizza is good (i like the meat supreme and I ask for a side topping of basil). No its not hard to find, just take the cylinder elevator in the center of the east tower to the 3rd floor and bust an immediate left down the corridor with pictures all on the wall. No its not cheap, I had my supreme slice with an orange soda for $10, pretty expensive even by New York standards for just 1 slice, but maybe not so much by Vegas standards. BUT, did you know for $4.50 they also have huge slices of mind blowingly delicious SECRET CHEESECAKE?!?!?! This is my second time staying in the cosmo, and thanks to a craving, I hunted down this delectable gem, after speaking to various workers in different restaurants in search of a cheesecake to get my fix before my flight. WOW is it yummy, perfectly chilled, savory graham cracker crust, creamy yet dense cheesecake texture, its sooooo rich. Totally not advertised. You wont even know about it if you dont read this review, or unless you happen to be scavenger hunting down a cheesecake in the cosmo like myself. Dont. Miss it. YUM.
Place is as good as it gets, I dont know if being drunk every single time I come helps but from what I remember this place is awesome.  . . Tip: Just get it by the pie, pizza is always better right out of the oven. . Another tip: Go at an odd hour to avoid the lines, this place isnt too much of a secret anymore. . . Enjoy!
Every time I go to Vegas, I definitely need to stop by this place for some really good Pizza! The hours are very good as most Pizza joints cater to late night hunger! I usually get whatever looks pleasing from the window, usually my favorite is Pepperoni and Cheese! The crust is thin, the ingredients used are good and it satisfies my pizza craving! I recommend this place to everyone!
Delicious thin crust pizza, and it's definitely a secret since there aren't any signs leading to it...just some random hallway and bam! you're inside Secret Pizza. . . But anyways, the toppings they offer are delicious. I got an all white pizza the day I came. I could probably eat their pizza all day long. GO!!! . . Prices are good, portions are great, and it's all quality.
Place is good because it is fast, good, and hits the spot. . . I recommend going here after the clubs to get some carbs in you! . . Tips: If you go after you come out of Marquee the lines can be pretty long so you may be better
This has got to be the most delicious pizza in Las Vegas! Wish I had visited this secret place a long time ago. Reasonably priced pizza and friendly staff.. clean as well. GO.
There's just something great about an unpretentious hidden pizza counter deep within the Cosmo that serves absolutely delicious, mouth-watering, crusty slices of some of the best pizza I've ever had.  One slice with a Blue Moon filled me up.. . I swear the guy behind the counter is related to Andy Samberg...I can't be the only one to think that.  Very nice guy who seemed to love his job or at least serving people this low-key, fantastic pizza.. . The place opens at 11am and stays open till 4am - probably mostly for the Marquee club crowd.  I heard lines get out the door so if you want to come to this place - if you can FIND it - come early.
super big slices. kinda pricey, but what isn't in vegas. can almost compete with pizza from new york. def can compete against them when you've consumed some alcohol. . it's on the cosmo side closest to las vegas blvd. we walked from the vdara side...so it was along walk.
great place to get pizza late night. all of their pizza is very good. they're overpriced, but it's at the cosmo and you don't have to leave the strip so it's an understandable price to pay...and the lines get very very long.
So not such a well-kept secret, but there is no sign and it is not on the map, so it's not well known. Good slice, and for the price in Vegas, you can't beat it. I had the white pizza, which was really good for sure. We weren't drunk, but after a night of drinking I believe this would be just the place! Unpretentious, especially for Vegas...gotta love it!
Amazing doesn't even begin to describe this pizza!!! A group of 8 of us were hanging at the chandelier and got hungry so one of the men trekked to find us some sustenance. The sausage and pepperoni was incredible, I wish I had taken a picture to put up here. Just be sure, it's kinda pricey (it's Vegas, hello) but delicious nonetheless
What a disappointment. The people who gave this place good reviews must've been super drunk. The "secret" thing about it is unique. But that was the only thing kind of cool about it. We waited in a long line for mediocre pizza and subpar service. There was nowhere to sit and two pinball machines taking up half the tiny pizza shop. In the end, our deal breaker was the NO RANCH policy.
What's not to love? Its a great hidden NY style pizza spot. Pizza is fresh, fast and price isn't bad considering its on the strip. The guys who work there are always friendly. Love the variety of things they have for you to shake on the pizza since you get it. Highly recommend!
The pizza was so good I ended up going back the next day. . Great price with quick and excellent service.
The best part of this place is the scavenger hunt to find it. The location is ridiculously obscure. The hotel doesn't even have it listed on their website. The casino is 3 floors away, and unless you're LEAVING Marquee, you wouldn't have a reason to discover this pizza place.. . We found a random hallway with albums all along the wall, and I knew from reading yelp that this was the place. There was a bouncer right at the mouth of the hall, and I was half expecting them to say something, but they just nodded and said, "Enjoy the pizza.". . Then things started going downhill. The pizza was over-priced ($5 a slice for cheese) and mediocre at best. I had even been drinking, and it was just a let-down to be honest. The pizza was not a lot of food, and the crust was flimsy and a bit over-worked to have a nice chew/mouth-feel.. . The toppings were typical of any hole-in-the-wall pizza place, and the slices waiting to be served harkened a less than stellar Sbarro feeling. The place looked out of place in the otherwise impeccable Cosmopolitan, and the drinks were served in red plastic solo cups. I'm not in college anymore, and I'm not at Circus Circus... please just give it to me in the bottle, or better yet an actual glass.. . The line wasn't too bad when we arrived. (Around 9:00pm) But apparently it gets ape-shit when the clubs start to close down. If that was the case, I'd definitely not wait in line for this. But the 10 minute line wasn't that bad.... too bad the food wasn't even worth it.. . In conclusion, I'd say you're better off spending your Vegas money elsewhere. It's a unique idea, with a bad product. I'd highly recommend 800 Degrees Pizza in front of the Monte Carlo for a truly amazing pizza.
This place was super hard to find!  I was pretty tipsy and all I remember was going through different sets of elevators and escalators, past swanky lobbies and convention rooms, and suddenly I was walking down a hallway of vinyl records filled with other drunken people.  You'll smell the place before you see it...IF you see it!. . Was led to Secret Pizza by Mr. W. for some late-night munchies to soak up the booze that wouldn't leave my system.  I had a hankering and Pizza was calling my name.  Heeding Siren's call, this place was suggested to me after Mr. W.'s own drunken adventures with his crew.  We ordered four slices and took it back to our room.  Eating pizza on the balcony of your Cosmopolitan suite is pretty amazingly epic when it's 4 in the morning.. . Maybe it was the alcohol but sinking my teeth for that first bite of cheesy meaty goodness was amazing.  New York style thin crust, some cheese drag action, and a generous helping of toppings.  I'm in Heaven.  It's not the best pizza ever or even the best slice on the Strip but it's pretty darn good and nicely priced!  At $5+ a slice, it was great.  The slices are gigantic and I only ate one slice out of the two that I ordered.  Passing out in a food and booze coma afterward resulted in the best sleep ever.  Hurray for Secret Pizza!
This place is a very solid pizza joint. Coming from New York, I appreciate a good solid pizza. . . The prices for a pie here isn't the cheapest in the world, but it's some of the cheapest you'll pay on the strip. At 26 bucks for a regular pie and 28 for a white pie, it's really a good deal. There are 10 slices to the pie, and it comfortably fed myself and 3 of my family members. . . 30 bucks for a dinner for 4? I dare you to find that anywhere else on the strip. . . What's more is we enjoyed playing ms. Pacman and their pinball machines while we waited! The lack of seating is a bummer, but we got the only 4 chairs in the place so we were fine. . . The white pie was really good, though next time around I think we will give the regular pie a shot with the meatball topping. It looked delicious!
Yummy pizza we ordered the white "pie" with mushrooms on top and it came to ~$30. But I suggest that you order it ahead of time cus the wait for a whole pizza is more than 10 minutes. . . But the workers are super cool, the location is awesome, ON THE 3RD FLOOR OF the cosmo towards the shops and restaurants sign and just look out for a wall full of records like a collage almost and you'll see it. Or just a bunch or ppl eating pizza you can just ask them. Hahah but the pizza is bomb. . . . . . The end
Less than $10 for lunch in Vegas? Check.. . Giant slice of New York style pizza? Check.. . Pinball machine? Check.. . Humorous cashier? Check.. . One combo sliced pizza (sausage and pepperoni pizza, $6 - tax included): A bit greasy, but it was pretty good.. . Excellent place for a quick and cheap (relative to other eateries on the Strip) lunch / dinner. Good luck on finding the "Secret" Pizza. . . Can't find or just too lazy to locate the pizza place? Get to 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan via escalator and you should see a hallway to the left of Jaleo and to the right of Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill.
OMG!!!!. This place is amazing! The girl who took my order was so awesome. There was some Irish dude and he was all "I already ordered right! Why is this taking so long???" And she was like "You ordered 3 pizzas! It's not Pizza Hut!" That pretty much shut him up! It was hilarious! My pizza was so good! It was hot too! The crust was super moist and flavorful. I would eat three pizzas if I could!
So secret and so good! Best prices for good pizza especially in Vegas. Def a must try when staying at the Cosmo
Great pizza. This place is a hidden gem-I have been over 6 times already-I recommend adding ricotta to your pizza. Salad was also very good. I have had a lot of pizza and this is the best one in town.
I would give this place 2 stars - I ordered a pepperoni slice with Italian sausage... that proved to be a mistake... although the crust was delicious and the pizza was nice and thin... I think the sausage just made the pizza too greasy and the whole thing just started breaking and falling apart making it messy and difficult to eat... in fact the first thing I noticed about my slice when they gave it to me was the huge puddle of grease in the middle... I've better pizza in Houston.... . My husband would give this place 4 stars - He ordered a pepperoni slice with banana peppers.  His was not as greasy as mine and his did not fall apart.  He loves pizza and he really enjoyed this place.  . . 2 stars from me, 4 stars from my husband... average of 3 stars...
Actually some pretty good pizza especially the white pizza because of the ricotta cheese. It is not that of a secret place because once you get to the floor, the hall is pretty noticeable. But when you do getthere, it all just looks random. Great food especially if you have been drinking!
Actually some of the best pizza in town.  The problem is that, unless you are already at the Cosmo, it's not worth the trouble of driving to the strip, parking, going to the third floor and waiting in line just for pizza (and there is no where to sit, only standing counters). However, if you are a hotel guest, you can order a pie by phone and just run down there to pick it up, and you'll make all the people standing in line jealous. Also good to grab a slice before the Dive-in movies.
The pizza was very good , I think it was one the best pizza I've had. I'm from Los Angeles and there are some good pizza places out there but this one top them all.
Hard to find but so worth the search.  Fantastic pizza, awesome customer service.  Only a couple bar stools so you'll eat standing or have to take it outside to sit somewhere in the casino.  The pizza is so good I don't even think about the fact I'm standing to eat it.
Best pizza I've ever had!  Employees were very nice!
Hands down best pizza in Las Vegas I'm a local and were always searching new places to eat , welcoming happy place don't miss out if you live here or if you are just visiting great pizza !!!
Pizzas great and it's open late. Perfect for soaking up drinks. Location is good because it's not packed right next to a bunch of other things. Plus you can walk downstairs afterwards and watch a bunch of people walk around the Cosmo all dressed up like they are fancy and important. Music album hallway is nice touch to browse while you are waiting in line.
We decided to check this place out and it wasn't too hard to find. We googled to figure out where it was, but honestly once you get to the floor it's on, the 3947298 people sitting around eating pizza (at 3am on a Tuesday no less!!) will let you know you are in the right place :-). . The good:. . The Pizza was GREAT! I wanted to have the white, but the mushroom looked too good, so I got that one and really, it was perfect. It really had me wishing it was a place close to my house because it would be our new go to pizza spot for sure, if it was closer.. . The bad:. . Pricey - $5-$6 a slice is a little much. . Size - Our group got 5 slices and I thought they varied in size a little too much. My sister's mushroom slice was much smaller than mine. . . The place is very small, not really any room to sit, but when you get out to the common area in Cosmo, there was a lot of seating all over the place. We sat at a little Foosball table.....very cool :-) Definitely a place worth visiting when you can.
After waiting in line for an hour, I paid $8.00 for ONE slice of pizza... Then some random guy offered to pay double to skip the line, and they let him skip my friends. THEN the cashier made fun of my friends for ordering salad
The pizza was very good, but customer service is not a priority. Yet, who are going to complain to? The place is a "secret".
Highly over rated look at reviews carefully and ask yourselves "what TIME did the following review taken place ?" and maybe you can start from there. If your young and don't have much life experience and are drunk or simply hungry and too lazy to go  else then maybe this place is for you. I travel a lot come to Vegas more than often have friends that work on the strip and I must say I'm very dissatisfied BUT hey who am iii to judge ??? I'm  a natural born critic who was born and raised in LA has lived in Chicago DC and Virginia now I'm back in Cali ask my questions I love to help
Highly overrated unless you are drunk individual with no life experience.Bad service and the pizza isn't as good as most people describe. Look at the people reviewing this place and when they are rating. Typically late at night after drinking the night away at Marquee since it's practically next door. Don't believe the New Pizza hype for this place cause if you have had real NY pizza IN NY then You'll understand
We were staying at the hotel and heard about this place. Took a bit of looking but we were rewarded at the end of the long hallway lined in old album covers. . . Honestly this was a great slice of pizza.  The crust stood up and did not get saturated with all the toppings.  Had a piece of pepperoni and a slice of vegetarian.  The peppers and tomatoes on the veggie slice were wonderful loaded with flavor.  . . If you want a cheap, fast, quality eat come here for a slice.  I will definitely go back.    . . Staff was friendly and quick.
A perfect example of why Yelp sucks the soul out of me ... if this place can't get five stars then what can? It's cool because it's impossible to find in a city that outrageously promotes itself ... and much more importantly, the slice is great.  I got a pepperoni and mushroom ... it was fresh and tasty.  Plus I hadn't had a drop to drink, and it was great.  Just imagine what it would taste like after a night of drinking!
Heard alot about this "Secret" Pizza place so i thought i would give it a try... $6 for your average slice of pizza. nothing special. I guess this can be great after a night at marquee.. The lines can get long here, but I'm glad there wasn't a line when we came. I would say it is not worth the wait.
An affordable and tasty option within The Cosmopolitan hotel. Thanks Yelp! for the recommendation!. . I had a slice of mushroom pizza and a beer they had on tap. $13 - not bad considering most of the bars charge that for a beverage. The mushrooms were a little salty, so adding some green pepper might help balance the flavor a bit. I enjoyed this hidden gem of a restaurant.
It's in Cosmopolitan doesn't mean it's fancy (kinda hidden and hard to find) Don't expect to sit and dine there, if you're lucky you might find a broken stool. lol. Their pizzas are average.. I remember saying it's good because I was sooo hungry but if to compare with Pizza Hut I think I would rather get for Pizza Hut. Don't get me wrong maybe I'm not a #1 pizza fan. Good luck!
Awesome place! We had a great time when we came here, it was so fun!!! Not only do they have delicious pizza but the people there were friendly! We made so many friends and had a good time with strangers. My girlfriends and I were lucky to randomly find this place. Definitely a must when coming to Vegas.
Don't worry you'll find it. HINT: look for the 80's arcade games! . Really good NY style slices...and a steal @ around 5$/a slice-In *this place*??? WTF is everyone whining about the prices for? You're in the effin COSMO!?!?. Anyway, bk 2 Pizza...simple is better..Just get 2 slices of 'White' (TIP WELL) and politely ask for a water cup. TIP WELL. If you're not a drunk silk-shirted loudmouth, u may just get access to some free h2o!. . These folks will be just as cool as *you* are being. Theyre bustin their arses to feed you, so please consider: best-cheap-wee-hour-NY-pizza in Vegas..inside the pricey-ass (but fly) Cosmo...What's my point? DON'T BE A DBAG! TIP WELL! Class dismissed. Now go shoot some pool..
The piZza here is delicious!! Came to cosmopolitan a while ago and walked around and found this pizza joint with a long line and saw the pizza but couldn't get any at the time. We came back at a more convenient time and no line, choice of slices and it was awesome! My husband got the Sicilian slice, looks like a thick slice of lasagna...he ate it all and locked his fingers clean...it was a massive slice! I had the regular pepperoni and it was yum!! I know my kids would love this pizza!! Gonna try it again next time we come and maybe get a whole pie!!
Vegas just wouldn't be the same for me without multiple visits to Secret Pizza! It's been a good two years since my last trip to Sin City and I'm proud to say that it's still the real deal! I took a girlfriend here with me on our first night and at 3am it was still open and still in the same spot on the 4th floor of the Cosmo. She marveled at how there's no signage, no listing, and I replied "That's why it's a SECRET! Lol" Even at 3am there's a long line but thankfully everything moves pretty quickly. True to Vegas party scene everyone in line with us was pretty much wasted and the folks behind us were obnoxiously drunk. . . We finally got to the front and the pizza guy chit chatted with us about what slices they were offering at that time. I honestly marvel at how nice everyone is at Secret Pizza because if I had to deal with all the tomfoolery I don't think I'd be nearly as patient. We each got two slices and a Coke to go. The prices have gone up from $3.50 to $4.75 per slice with an additional $.50 per topping. Still not so bad when you consider that you're in a very touristy area and it is 3am. . . Overall still a really great experience and literally a "hidden" gem on the Las Vegas Strip. We came back the next night again for Secret Pizza as we were hanging out at the bar and my girlfriend came back a third time the next night because she wanted to make sure she got another slice before we headed back home! Now THAT is some gooooood pizza folks! May you be very lucky during your trip to Vegas and may your stomach be blessed with the deliciousness of Secret Pizza!!!
