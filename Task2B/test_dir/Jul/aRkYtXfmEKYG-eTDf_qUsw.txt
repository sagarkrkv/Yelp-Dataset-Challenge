Tried the blueberry corn muffin, the corn bread part was super dry and the blueberry part was super soggy ! Also the grill doesn't open till 7 and I came in at 630.
Brought my mom here and I think she felt really out of place, which typically (and correctly) means it was an entertaining experience.. . The clientele here make for highly entertaining people watching. At ten in the morning, there was the guy who never took his shades off, inside. His buddy next to him looked like a hired goon from a 1960s era James Bond, with slacks, a dark long sleeve button up shirt and a pony tail. Then in walked Phoenix's Russell Brand equivalent. Clearly either on molly or in a manic phase, homey was just LOVING life. Everyone in his path got a high five or a hug and a smile, with his dreads flopping this way and that. At some point he walked behind the counter like he owned the place, because apparently the baristas needed hugs and high fives too. Then his girlfriend walks in, a beautiful girl covered head to toe in body art. They eventually walk over to Shades and Igor and he introduces her to them. Her name is Goddess. I half expected her to begin an incantation, but apparently she wasn't so moved.. . Not everyone in Lux is as awesome as these people, there are a fair share of people who didn't look like they throw their enemies into pools filled with sharks or have bipolar disorder. Boring people like me. Fortunately there will be enough characters who could have walked out of a B-movie that you shouldn't get bored. Suffice to say that you will likely be entertained.. . The food was very good as well, and the coffee was perfect. The scene here is so rad though that those come as an asterisk.. . No great if you: are looking for a Starbucks equivalent. Great if you: need a high five and a hug
There iced Carmel macchiato is the best! You need to check this place out. There open late! It's very hipster in here and great place to hang out
I automatically earned 5 more cool points just for stepping foot inside this coffee shop. At least, that's what I think! This new location for Lux is much "cooler" than the other location. Everyone works on their computer at community tables or couch-like settings and sip on delicious coffee with Lux's signature homemade whip cream. Lux's coffee is some of my favorite and the whip cream is absolutely my favorite. Besides wi fi, coffee and tasty pastries, this coffee shop also serves up breakfast and lunch but the choices are minimal. However, the food looks delicious but I have yet to have a meal here. This is a great spot to set up shop to work, but if you plan on doing so, get there early because it fills up fast!
Great coffee and great atmosphere.
If you look up the antonym to hipster you will find my photo.. We were referred here by our awesome waiter Matt at the Henry for drinks. . It was a Saturday night, about 10 pm and my boyfriend and I went dressed up (NY standard, not PHX standards) like we usually are to go out and needless to say the minute we stepped foot inside I felt a little out of place. But we forged through the coffee area to the back bar area. We found two cozy seats and were greeted. I have to say although I look very different then anyone working there and most people going there they were all very nice to us and helpful (which I cannot say of all "hipster joints" *cough* Cartel *Cough*). . If you like a great cocktail and even to challenge your palate, You HAVE to go hear! They have all quality liquors and mixers and to make it even better, there is NO cocktail menu. They can make all the classics, but the fun part is telling them what you like and don't like in a drink and they will create fabulous concoction just for you! I am talking rose water, lavender, all kinds of herbs and unique flavor profiles and combinations. To make it better, the prices are reasonable! To get a fabulous hand-made cocktail with all top shelf and beyond liquors for $8-$10 is a great deal and  they don't use ice and "fillers" to cut you short, with a couple drinks you will feel, let's say, relaxed.... Now the Mac-n-cheese with Bacon and Jalapenos!!! YES! It is perfect. Great comfort food, you may feel guilty for having consumed all that fat BUT it is totally worth it and you will love every moment of it!. Their baked goods and coffee are also great.. The music however... I have been there when they played the whole collection of Metallica (Lord, help me)... It isn't always that awful, however I don't care for the music most restaurants play today, so I digress. . I have already brought a few people and suggested it to a few others.... this is a must try!. I tell you what, hipsters know their cocktails, coffee and food.
Super busy...kind of a cluster-F even..but cool environment.  Food is solid.  Expresso is very...bold.
Really enjoyable  coffee but extremely tough to get a seat. . . I felt like we had to lurk around for seats like the old lady at a casino (yes, that is a friends reference) looking for the lucky slot machine. . . Came around dinner time, and the big table in the back was reserved, which is perfectly reasonable. . Even though there are multiple nooks and crannies in the establishment, many of the seats were occupied by non-paying customers on their laptops. We were trying to figure out where to sit, but kept getting angry glares since guests are pretending this is a silent library and not a business. . . Okay college students, we surrender. . We were forced to enjoy our hot drinks in the outdoor patio, and with the 100 degree heat & second-hand smoke...like the place; hate the patrons.
This is my favorite coffee shop. They have free refills on drip coffee iced tea and dollar refills on red eyes and iced coffee. Though the pastries are a bit on the expensive side they are totally worth it. The changing lunch menu is always fantastic!
This place has amazing lattes and a warm, eccentric atmosphere. Great to meet up and chat with friends or a date.
A must try just for the atmosphere! My husband and I, I would say, have just aged-out of the target demographic of this place. We actually brought our baby (as I said, just aged-out, so new baby must come along on vacations) and it was super chill. While there was no sitting inside, the outside was a lovely Phoenix evening with a lovely crowd of folks. . . We tried out pastries and coffee drinks. The pastries--Red Velvet Cake and Lemon Bar--I wanted to love because they came on adorable mismatching china, but at that late hour they had unfortunately staled. . . But the coffee! I had a decaf Americano and it was maybe the best coffee I've ever had. And to be honest, decaf is never good. It's just something to sip on whole others have a cocktail. This decaf, though.... . My husband waited in the epic cocktail line (separate from the food/coffee drink line) and asked the bartender to surprise him with something coffee-based. He was served some kind of masterpiece of spirits and freshly-pulled espresso, complete with thoughtful aromatic garnishes. Again, rocking coffee.
If you love hipsters and great coffee, you'll adore Lux.. . Bring your latest novel, poetry, or your laptop, throw on your big-rimmed glasses, and order a delicious vegan pastry and a feelin'-fancy coffee, and be one of the cool kids in downtown Phoenix. You'll love the people watching and the food/drinks are great. This is a wonderful date location on a Friday night or a fabulous Saturday afternoon escape with your pals.. . Seating can be hard to come by, especially if you're in a group of three or more, but it's worth being a seating shark. Love the pink couches.. . The friendly service is great, and surprisingly, the crowd was baby-friendly! We brought my niece in (dressed in her hippest leggings and onesie, naturally), and people stopped to coo at her and tell her what a good baby she was--i.e. smiling and laughing the whole two hours we were there. Hipsters have hearts, too. Who knew?
Never seen such a high concentration of the hipster crowd mixed with the Scottsdale crowd. I was definitely comfortable as the fellow guests were very friendly and if I wasn't busy I felt I could have good conversations with. The staff.....kind of off-setting and frankly intimidating...felt like if I asked where the bathroom is I would get glared at and indirectly told to leave as soon as I used the facility. However they are quick, know their coffee, and certainly know how to run the joint overall. It is crowded, but I don't mind it. It's ironically roomy once you sit down and realize that everyone gets the whole "elbow room" deal. So my advice to Lux is to be a little friendlier and open to the guests, especially the first-timers, and my advice to you coffee-lovers and food-tasters is, GO! And enjoy the independent and unique atmosphere.
This place was fantastic!  It is open late which is always nice.  They have a full bar for those who want to continue with the nights festivities but they also have OUTSTANDING coffee!  It is the kind of place where you can hang out for hours and go back for a few cups so come either with good friends or a good read.  I plan on going back to try the food but unfortunately, only went for late after dinner coffee this time around.  I love that you can see them cooking right there in front of you.  Can't wait to go back!
Solid coffee lounge/ bar! i highly recommend it to any fan of interesting little nooks in a large city. Definitely for those looking to explore the individual unique experiences.
Holy Smokes! This place sets the bar high for what is cool. Any other establishment would be suffering from a major identity crisis if they tried to simultaneously function as a coffee shop, bakery, restaurant, and bar but Lux somehow does it all and does it right! If you are someone who likes working at a table with strangers (as most tables or couches will be full by the time you get there), loud music and the temptation to drink booze rather than coffee, Lux is the place for you!!. . I love showing my friends from out of town this place in hopes they will fall in love with Lux, quit their jobs, leave their families and move into Phoenix!. . Personally, I am nowheres cool enough to hangout here on a regular basis. The DJ plays his music too loud, I can never find an open table, and I always fall a fool to the temptation of to sipping down the nectar of me people, Templeton Rye. Iowa Represent!! But even with all that up against me, I still stop by at the Lux very so often to remind me how much of a basic b*tch I actually am. LOVE THIS PLACE!
Lux is a rare gem in the otherwise homogenized coffee shop scene which permeates the greater Phoenix metro. A haven for the "hipster" and "indie" crowds, it is frequently populated with would be iconoclasts who, if you move past the stereotypes usually cast upon such people, are largely friendly and unpretentious.. . The service is earnest and talented producing some of the best cappucinos, americanos and other assorted caffeinated beverages in town. The various baked goods are reasonably priced and obviously crafted with care providing stark contest to the mass-produced crap most coffee shops sling with something like disdain for their customers.. . I only hesitate to award the fifth star for lack of experience with the other offerings of food and drink they offer. An omission to my experience I hope to soon include.. . EDIT: Since I never got around to posting this review after my first visit and subsequently visited numerous times I can confirm this to be a five-star establishment. In addition to the quality coffee beverages they offer their bar was (and likely still is) quite well stocked and competently tended. They offer a very solid selection of quality liquors and beers (can't speak confidently to their wine selection, I'm not much for the vino). Their meals are often exquisite and understated, though not exactly cheap. All told I definitely consider this and Copper Star to sit alone atop the Phoenix coffee throne.
Usually I love everything at lux and they have the best soup. But today it was more like extra garlicky gross spaghetti sauce soup and I hated it but I still love lux! First thing here I didn't like
Hip place.  Can be busy at times.  Perfect for study and a drink or two.  Lunch is quaint.
