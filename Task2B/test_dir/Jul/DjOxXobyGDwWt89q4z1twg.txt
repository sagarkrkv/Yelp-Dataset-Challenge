It was quite the adventure finding this place since I am from out of town and this establishment is located in the depth of a strip mall in Chinatown.... but we found it! And I am SO glad that we did! They have the best ramen that I have had so far (in life). Oh my goodness! . So the restaurant itself would be best described as cozy... I wouldn't come strolling in 10+ people deep. Most of the seating appears to be surrounding the kitchen in a bar-like fashion. The menu is pretty basic and to the point - easy enough to order. You have a selection of noodles/ramen dishes to choose from... then you can add extras like egg, nori, etc. The basic ramen dishes are pretty filling themselves....but I added egg and nori for more flavor. Oh. My. God. It's like a flavor explosion. Maybe I'm not experienced enough in the ramen world.... but view become a bit obsessed trying it everywhere I go... and I'm not even exaggerating when I say that this is the best ramen I've had (so far). If you're a lover of ramen, STOP HERE!
have to try: its very small so expect to wait but the service is very quick. The menu is very simple but very good. Three to four ramens to choose from and a variety of extras to add into your ramen.. . Recommend the Kimichi fried rice!!
Went in during rush hour, which sucked because this place is super small and probably only sits about 30 or less people. We ended up waiting a really long time for our seats.. . This place is supposedly the best ramen place in Las Vegas. Came out here and expected it to be awesome. However my opinion wouldn't matter because I'm not Japanese so how would I really know if this place is legit? . . I ordered the spicy tonkotsu shoyu ramen with extra egg and pork. It was alright... Kinda meh. I expected more. This place is just an ordinary ramen place to me. . . We came in as a group and asked for separate checks, but the worker didn't want to give us separate checks because apparently it was too complicated for her.
Get 2 things!  It's just so good!  I'd almost come to Vegas solely for the ramen here.  Every time we come to visit we rent a car just so we can come off the strip and eat here!  All their ramens are fantastic and a great deal.  The pork is extremely tender and we always get an extra rice bowl with the chiashu pork!. . The reviews really speak for themselves here.  The only thing that's a problem is that the place is too small.  There's almost always a wait, but no complaints here.
Holy crap. I had one of the best dishes I've had in Vegas at Monta. Being a hot day, I ordered the cold noodles. The plate consisted of perfectly cooked, cooled ramen noodles with an assortment of toppings including perfectly-ripe sliced tomato, memna (which were the absolute best I've had without that odd, chemical taste), shredded egg, crunchy tree fungus, slightly marinated bean sprouts, thin sliced spring onion, and topped with a creamy, seeet, vinegary sesame dressing.. . Amazing.
All the reviews are right!  WOW! So good. I had the Miso $7.25 for a bowl of delishesness
Still my favorite ramen place in town after many years. Miso ramen and the new Kuro (black garlic oil) ramen are both unbelievably great. Just took a newbie there today and he was amazed at the taste of his Miso ramen. A word of advice--this place gets packed during regular meal times (11am-3pm and 5pm-9pm), so expect a 30 minute wait. Or if you are a eat anytime guy like me, then go eat at 4pm and you would not have to wait in line!
Blistering hot July 4th weekend... Ramen? Okay! Place opened at 11:30 and at 11:07 there were already 15 people ahead of us. Luckily the place seats a bit more (20 maybe?) so we made the cut! The chashu was amazing. Super soft, melt in your mouth fatty fatty pieces! The pork belly bowl was also very good.
One of my favorite ramen place .... Busy busy place but worth the wait...
Having never been in Vegas before, I trusted my stomach in the hands on Yelp! I was thoroughly impressed with Monta Ramen. The food, environment, and service was great. I loved everything!
Best ramen I had in a while. Try the one with chicken and pork brother, also the pork belly rice bowl, you can't go wrong W this 2 dish !
This place is awesome! Ive always seen there has been lines out the door soni decided to check out the popularity. The food here is spectacular! Cant wait to eat here again!. . Saori is always my sever and she is awesome! Her hospitality is the best. She is super beautiful too! I love you....I mean youre awesome hahaha ;)
I get the biggest stomach boner just thinking about this place. More than sushi, more than even in n out, does this place make me want to commit suicide via ohm nom nom.. . Some People b*tch about the service, but the servers aren't there to chit chat and entertain you (which is completely fine by me), they're there to (in order) get your drinks, food order, refill drinks, food delivery, accept payment, then shuffle you the f*ck out so I can stuff my face with shoyu with extra egg... And nori..... And extra pork chashu.... And.... and.....FAPFAPFAPFAP....
Wow, this is the best ramen I have had in Vegas.. . Keep in mind the place is super tiny, maybe seats 20 at most...and A/C doesn't really work so it is like sitting in a UPS truck(not that I've ever been in one but...u get the idea). . We were seated almost right away even though there were ppl waiting in front of us(perhaps they are in large groups).  The lady who seated us was really nice, later on there was another waitress who brought our ramen to us, cute and also nice(I think it is probably the owner and her daughter as they look alike), of course the 5 stars isn't based on the looks but honestly it does help a little(even without it, the ramen itself still deserves 5 stars).  We tried the #1 tonkotsu ramen with thin noodles, it was very rich in flavor, but our favorite was the Kuro ramen(the tonkotsu broth with black garlic oil), it was superb! and the chashu was not only buttery but also taste like it was grilled first!. . There is also a shave ice place in same plaza which is also very good, and a foot massage place(make sure you yelp for the one with 4 stars, not the one with 1 star... :P). . I hope they open one in LA soon!
perhaps my expectations were too high.. . i had the black garlic ramen. was not impressed. soup too salty. ramen noodles not chewy enough. sorry monta, wanted to love you but was disappointed.
One of the best ramen spots I've ever been to by far. Def try it if your around this area.
Love some tasty ramen. The place is small and seating goes quickly but people eat fast so usually the wait isn't long. Service is good. The noodles are tasty and big portions! Parking kinda sucks if they're busy.
Black Garlic Oil Tonkatsu Ramen. - super SALTY, my tongue was slightly numb because of all the salt. - broth was viscous and very fatty.  it was like liquid cholesterol.. - pork slices was good. . unfortunately due to my stomach cramps followed by greasy bowel movements, I cannot give this place more than 2 stars
Salt bombed is the best way to describe both of our ramen bowls. The thick and rich, gravy-like broth, was extremely salty and offended our taste buds. Although I preferred the spicy miso ramen over the tonkotsu shoyu, they were both incredibly heavy and beyond rich. The bowl and noodles were piping hot, but the broth was just warm. . . We couldn't finish our bowls and left about 65% of it back (noodles and broth). After our dinner, our stomachs had a hard time digesting the richness and we felt a little nauseous. We could of shared one bowl of ramen, it was super filling and we had a ton of leftovers. . . This is the first time I've ever regretted adding extra toppings on my ramen. The toppings didn't enhance or compliment our ramen. It all got lost in the thick salty broth. Plus the topping choices were rather boring, the best had to of been: corn, kimchi, and nitamago (flavored egg) - the kimchi was fresh and flavorful and they have perfected their soft-boiled egg!. . Here's what we ordered: . Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen with thin noodles (I didn't care for these noodles) and 2 slices of chashu (and with all of the extras):. +dried seaweed - pretty boring. +corn - I loved the corn's sweetness and texture . +nitamago (flavored soft boiled egg)- perfect! . +mustard leaf - mushy and flavorless. +shredded green onion - adds nice texture and freshness. +butter - this ramen doesn't need more richness! . $12.45 . . Spicy Miso Ramen with thick wavy noodles (the best noodles!) and 2 slices of thin chashu (and with all of the extras):. +dried seaweed - boring. +corn - great!. +nitamago (flavored egg) - great! . +mustard leaf - boring and mushy. +shredded green onion - adds freshness. +butter - this ramen does not need more richness! :x. $13.75. . Side of extra chashu $2.50 - super fatty and buttery. . . Side of Kimchi $1 - very fresh and flavorful. . . Small pork belly bowl $3.95 - this was my favorite. The pork belly was tender, buttery, and rich in flavor. The rice was cooked perfectly and the green onion and sweet pickled ginger added perfect freshness to the rice bowl.. . After eating here, it really made me miss Santouka Ramen in Costa Mesa, CA and Shin-Sen-Gumi Hakata Ramen in Fountain Valley, CA. :/
Good ramen in Las Vegas? Unheard of! Walking into Monta, I expected mediocre ramen compared to the ramen places I have grown to love in Los Angeles and eft feeling incredibly ignorant. . . The Black Garlic Oil Ramen and Pork Belly Bowl was DELICIOUS. The only downside is the wait-be prepared and don't come when you are already starving unless you enjoy torturing yourself! Good things come to those who wait, don't miss out on my new go-to spot of Vegas!
I must say this place is worth the wait time.  Once you get a seat and order your Tonkatsu ramen, you can get ready for a savoy meal that you can remember for a very long time.  The fried rice that we ordered came first and it had the most pleasant taste ever.  For a ramen place, their fried rice was beyond exceptional.  The texture of the rice was just perfection to the tongue, sauteed to a heavenly standard.  The taste just melting into your taste palette is nothing less then the gold standard.  Once the ramen arrived,  the smell of the broth elicited a mouth watering sensation.  The delicate slices of Tonkatsu just melting into your tongue once you start to chew it in your mouth.  The broth was also truly rare and exceptional.  This is definitely a experience worth the wait.  :)
Went in yesterday for the first time, and it was yummy!  I had fried rice and my boyfriend had the Tonkotsu ramen, we both left very satisfied! Only complaint is that its too small, so you might end up waiting a while for a table! Aside from that its cheap and delicious!
Great place to eat when I crave for ramen noodles! Sittings are very tight and waiting line can be long, but the food is definitely worth the wait!
I usually go to the new location on Eastern/Serene, though I have gone to other one a well.  Consistent quality of the food.  The best ramen in town!  I love everything from the calamari, fried rice, karaage (fried chicken) and that crunchy spicy tuna appetizer.  Of course the ramen, don't forget to add extra chashu (pork). Yummy!  Prices are affordable too.
Dude good....    So many reviews out here....   I dont want to be redundant so I'll be short.    . . the good. . Food....   Yum Yum Yum. . the bad. . so small...     if its busy you will have to wait...    i think it was 3 tables. . also get the pork belly bowl...   do it now....    dont argue with me...     get it and thank me later. . The unfortunate and uncomfortable. . I liked it a lot and I rarely get sick from anything I eat but my wife does...    and did.   Had I eaten there alone it would have been 5 stars...   but my wife came home and was sick all night.      Bad Monta....     Bad Bad Monta
the BEST ramen house in town.  their menu is simple, not bombarded with so many choices. . . oh yeah, their pork belly fried rice is pretty amazing too.  . . during the winter, good luck with getting a table.  wait times can span to an hour or so.  it is a small restaurant and it's always packed.  but quality ramen at such a cheap price...I'd wait around for a table.
Me and my friends actually ended up here because the line at Oyster Bar was too long and we were starving. I personally am a ramen fan in general so I like trying new places, my other friend and her hubby are not big ramen fans, but luckily, after coming to Monta they have found a renewed interest in ramen.. . We all started with a glass of beer, pretty cheap at about $3 but they are not pints, I think more like 10oz-ers? Still it was a refreshing way to start the meal. . Shared the pickled greens fried rice and the pork belly rice bowl. Fried rice was cooked well and flavorful, the pork belly bowl was even better. The fatty pieces of pork were cooked perfectly tender with their greasy goodness seaping into the rice underneath. . . For ramen I got the half pork half chicken broth and added an egg. The chicken broth is supposed to be a little less rich but mine was still a pretty thick broth. Not that that's a bad thing, thick as in thick with flavor but sometimes I prefer a less rich broth because it can get very filling. So depending on what you like, the full tonkatsu broth would be richest and most flavorful and a the half and half would be a lighter version. Noodles were cooked perfectly. . . The place is typical small Japanese style shop, they have a list for you to write your name on and wait. The waitresses do a nice job of clearing the tables and getting everyone seated as soon as possible so even though we had a few parties ahead of us the wait wasn't too bad for lunch hour. It does get a little hot inside though, so be warned for those coming in the summer months.
Limited seating (6 tables that can sit parties of 4 and bar seating). 6 ramen style options, rice bowls, and appetizers. Around $7 per bowl. It's small!. My family pretty much tried all the different styles and we all agreed it was SUPERRRRR SALTY. Eggs are add-ons. I don't understand why it's so popular here, we all had to drink water with every slurp. The spicy ramen wasn't spicy, just a spoonful of hot sauce. Tea is $3.. . Yeah, won't be back. I wouldn't mind trying another place down closer to the strip. Private parking lot that's a tight squeeze with several other Asian cuisines around.
I came here at about 430pm, and thankfully there was no line. Definitely not a place to go if you and all six of your friends decide you want to eat together. You'll be hungry forever! . . Baseline offerings are affordable, but in a way its like an American airline- you get nickeled and dimed for every additional item, including an egg. By the time you've built the bowl of your dreams, you're probably pushing a few bucks extra than what you thought you'd be! . . The meat here is melt-in-your-mouth and fall apart tender. Really good. The egg is quite tasty as well.  I can tell that the food here is cooked meticulously and with pride when watching the guys cooking your noodles. That being said, I don't think it was really that exciting or remarkable. I got the shoyu ramen with less sodium in it, and the noodles and flavor weren't as good as Ramen Sora's.. . If you had to pick one of the two to try, I would try Ramen Sora. The atmosphere at Monta reminds me more of a cold winter day in Japan in a packed ramen house, but I like my American elbow room! Also, the flavors are brighter and portions are bigger at Ramen Sora. ;)
Bay Area in the house! Glad I got to try it since I didn't get to try their ramen at the Epic Ramen Festival.  Have to say it deserves the full five stars. You've got to try it for yourself.  The pork belly rice is the bomb too.
Shoyu RAmen  [ bomb ]   And especially pork bowl, I would forget the rAmen and just eAt the pork bowl instead [ bomb ] [ bomb ] [ bomb ] [ bomb ] . Why would you have a better dish then what you would normally serve? But it is the best in town [ bomb ]
Visited this place a few weeks ago and I can't say that it made a lasting impression. When my girlfriend asks where I would like to have lunch/dinner, this isn't one of the places that comes to mind. It wasn't bad but it could've been better. For one, the staff was a bit rude. Two, the place is ridiculously small so not only is the inside crowded but so is the outside; a crowd of people just waiting to be seated. I want to say there were four tables: three that sat four people and one that sat two, plus bar space. Lastly, the food was a bit on the salty side. I ordered the spiciest thing on the menu but it wasn't spicy at all. In fact, I added a ton of spice to it and it still wasn't satisfying to me. And keep in mind that you pay for EVERYTHING. Even a small plate of spice.. . Good but not memorable.
Monta Ramen is another ramen joint on Spring Mountain Road, there seems to be a ramen battle in this area.  The dining area was small when compared with the other locations, I would limit to group size to 6 below to be comfortably seated.. . I got their Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen.  The noodles was a bit disappointing, it tasted very mushy like they cooked them, but forgot to put them through a cold bath, and all the flour started to flaked off onto the broth.  Definitely did not look the same as some of the older pictures listed here.  The broth tasted ok in general.  Meat was tender.  Other than that, the ramen did not really had much in it, and having bad noodles pretty much ruined everything in the dish.. . Service was decent even though they seemed very busy though.  Perhaps they have gone downhill since they first opened?  I might try this place again if they are still open for business during my next trip.
I really loved this place. I had the miso ramen which was some of the best I've ever had! Place is small and cozy and the staff were very friendly. Definitely my new favorite spot!!
Really good ramen at cheap prices. It's worth the 5 minute drive away from the Strip to eat here. Just be warned they have limited seating. You may have to wait a while.
