Hakkasan sucks. Over crowded, over hyped, extremely expensive and u don't get what u pay for...... The ONLY good thing they have going for them is that tiesto is resident dj there. They should have kept the Lions instead.
I've never had a bad experience here, and never waited more than 20 min on any given night to get in. If you take the time to meet the right people you will never pay cover and get awesome perks. The only gripe I do have is sometimes re-entry could stop due to capacity.
we got comped admission due to dining at their restaurant. we got escorted up from the restaurant through the secret hallways. very Swingers/Goodfellas like. up a couple flights and we're in the Ling Ling club. apparently, this was the Hip Hop older brother of the upstairs, EDM room.  . . nice lounge chairs and easy bar service downstairs. upstairs was very concert hall like, with a sunken stage area for the dance floor. didn't spend too much time up there. it was pretty quiet too, till about midnight30. they did have more bathrooms upstairs instead of the unisex single use downstairs. oh, and good luck trying to fcuk in those things with all the security/attendants around. . . lots of stairs to traverse reminds me of Chichen Itza. music was ok, in both rooms. vibe was ok too. lots of young people obviously. dress code seemed medium dressy. my buddy and i had jeans with dress shoes and collared shirts. security was quite friendly and accomodating. even when they kicked us off our table for people that had paid for them. it was about time for us to leave at that point anyway. overall, we had an ok time. probably wont be back just because nothing stood out for us.
Dope club in Vegas had a really awesome time with friends awesome dj's , drinks were a little pricey but all in all had a wonderful experience bartenders were super nice great service!
A more detailed review will follow. But needless to say, I was very disappointed... From the ultra long "VIP Guest List" line, to the overpriced drinks, and utterly dark club that does NOT enforce a dress code - this was not as expected... I was really looking forward to having a good experience here.
Last minute decision to go clubbing on a saturday-monday trip, went to XS on saturday and didn't want to go back, so we decided to hit up Hakkasan for W&W after a friend said we would like that kind of music.  Bought tickets day of for $30 / guy while girls got in with a guest list.  The three of us showed up at around 10:30 and promptly got into the club.  Granted, at 10:30 it's literally only guys.  Seemed kind of sad at the time.. the DJ's doing his thing but the dance floor is empty.. . This was the second time I've been to Hakkasan, and I didn't much like it the first time, mostly because there's no outdoor area in this club.  This past weekend however, that was exactly what I was looking for, after deadmau5 at XS.  The outdoor areas at XS during summer are ridiculously hot... so that pushed me towards Hakkasan personally.  If it's gonna be crowded and suffocating, at least let there be some A/C.. . Anyway the whole thing turned out to be a lot of fun.  Though all the drops sounded similar, W&W turned out to be a pleasant surprise (much like Sultan and Ned Shepard were, if you read my other reviews.  Yelp is turning out to be a vegas blog for me..). . Didn't have to pay for a single drink (which I still feel pretty guilty about), so I can't comment on the price.  One thing I will say about Hakkasan though is that the girls they have dancing on the sides really make the experience a lot more fun.  No, not the ones with the crazy lights all over their bodies (those are cool too) but the ones I'm sure they put there next to the DJs at those tables.  Every single one of them was attractive, and there were no guys at those tables.  I mean yeah, MAYBE it could have happened that a group of girls get a table next to the DJ (for like what, 10k+?) but come on.  really, come on.
This club was awful. I was set up for my 21st birthday. He set is up at light the night before and it was amazing. Not even comparable to light. I will never go back and never recommend it. Before this experience MGM was my favorite hotel and I can say that changed my opinion of the entire hotel.
Now that I am flying back home to Miami, here is my full review on Hakkasan.... . THE LINE... . . First, if you get in a "VIP Guest List" and are told to simply go up and tell them you are on it, they will put you in a long ass line that was at least 800 people deep.  We went on Thursday, July 3rd - it was not a Tiesto night. When we got in line (about 10:35pm), it wrapped out to one of the doors near some restrooms - total time in line to get to the people actually checking the guest list ~1 hour.... Your ID *will* be checked - depending on how young you look, maybe a few times. Saw someone kicked out of line for having an expired DL too, so make sure you have a good one!  There were people in line with tickets for the night ($30)... So, that doesn't get you in any faster FYI. . . DRESS CODE.... . Guys... There is a sign that states "dress code strictly enforced."  I knew I was good... Figure if i can dress appropriately, everyone else should, right? WRONG! There were guys in line that got in wearing cheap solid color t-shirts, sleeveless t-shirts, and even tank tops. A few got in wearing polo shirts (borderline for a "high end" club if you ask me).  Guys - wear a button-down shirt for goodness sakes!  Ladies were mostly dressed appropriately for the scene - but, I haven't been to many clubs where the ladies do not know how to dress. . . GETTING INSIDE.... . After you are "checked off" the guest list, you approach another (final) ID check. Your wrist is stamped a second time and you are ushered to the register to pay to get in. Yes, we were on the guest list and didn't have to pay that night - the people that check you off earlier in line, issue you a "pass" telling the cashier how many males vs. females in your party.  You turn in that paper are handed a receipt, and then ushered into a bank of elevators which they pack shoulder to shoulder... Ugh! . . ONCE INSIDE.... . The elevator doors opened on the 4th floor and in you go to a hallway leading up a couple of stairs to the dance area. The first thing I noticed is the relatively small (read - packed) dance floor.  The dance area is surrounded by VIP tables/booths. There are a few bars around the outskirts of the floor/VIP area. As for decor, well... I think a friend put it best in reaction to a video I posted on Instagram... It looks like a black box with lights inside!. . If you are not a smoker, beware - you will get smoke in your face in this place. Sometimes you are walking along and poof! you walk into a cloud of smoke thanks to another patron. . . We also explored the 5th floor, figuring one could look down on the dance floor below and see the DJ, etc. Another disappointment here... Once you get upstairs, the only way to look down on the floor and see the DJ, is if you have one of the VIP tables/booths up there. Otherwise, you are at least 6-8' back from the overlook and can't see anything really. . . BAR.... . It's Vegas, so I figured it would be around $14-16 for a drink here. Ordered 2 goose with pineapple = $40 including tip.  The "glass" tumbler is plastic (I've been to "cheaper" clubs and they serve in actual glass - guess this place "can't afford" the glass???  As for the alcohol to mixer content - I would say it was average. Not terrible, but not $20 worth in my book. . . BATHROOM.... . You would think that a place the size of this one would have a decent restroom facility. I am sad to say that NO, it doesn't - at least the one I went to.  Once you get inside the bathroom, an attendant pretty much keeps things in check and"assigns" you a urinal or stall based on availability... Sound great, except that there were only 3 urinals and two stall that I remember seeing. Once done, the attendants are extremely courteous and do their job really well - tip them, as it may be the only thing that actually worked well!. . OVERALL.... . I would NOT go again, unless there is a special event going on where I know I will see a favorite DJ. Even then, I would be hard pressed to pay for a ticket or be on a VIP guest list. The only way to do this place right is probably to get a table, and from what I understood is definitely in the thousand$. . . Can't wait to get back to Miami to go to a real nightclub!
My friends and I go to Vegas just to party like every other month so we know the nightlife scene drill pretty much. Hakkasan is a beautiful club, music is awesome and they always bring the best DJs Calvin Harris, Tiesto etc...BUT the promoters of this place is terrible. Not once but 3 times my friends and I have had incidents with these douche bag promoters. Don't tell us you have us on your list then we end up not being on there like just tell us so we don't waste time waiting in the 3 mile line. Like I said beautiful club but the promoting team needs Jesus or maybe just some client/customer training. Will probably never go back unless someone special is there.
I have mixed feelings about this nightclub.. . On the one hand it is definitely a classy, sought after entertainment venue for Vegas' young and beautiful- regularly hosting some of the world's best DJ's. The interior of the club is pretty spectacular, definitely a visual feast plus the music is good (if you're into that sort of thing) and everyone seems to be there to have a fun time.. . On the other- the staff, especially the security guards outside the club, are very arrogant/snobby and don't really make the experience of getting into the place a pleasant one. The prices are high if you are male OR in a group of predominately males and the dress code for them is so strict it is borderline ridiculous (but only for some if you get my meaning).. . The club itself is packed to the rafters so if you don't have a VIP booth you will struggle to find space to breathe, let alone party. If you can afford it OR you can get a hook up I highly suggest getting one- you will seriously regret it if you don't.. . The one redeeming feature was a lovely security guard inside the venue who helped me lock and erase my phone from his when I realised it had been stolen by a fellow patron.. . Hakkasan is fun but I wouldn't be in a hurry to go again mainly because I like breathing and not having bouncers look down their nose at myself or my partner.
So went to Hakkasan the Sunday of EDC. Sold my Sunday pass since EDC was just too much for me this year. 8th year going and that event just got too ratchet. Regardless, Calvin Harris was spinning this night and we got on the list for VIP line. . . We were in within 30 min. No problem. . . Once inside, you entire the club and it feels like an underground cave at first. I forgot who opened, but the DJ did a great job opening up. The dance floor is beyond crazy small that you will not enjoy being in there. I found a great spot on the side and even by the ramp. . . Calvin absolutely killed it this night! . . Talked to really cool people there. Not one rude person I encountered. Security was super chill with my friends and I. . . Drinks are EXPENSIVE! You've been warned. Especially $9 for for a water bottle that is the size of my pinky. . . Sound and lighting are top notch! . . Leaving the place as a hot mess was not fun. I feel bad for you ladies. There are stairs and I mean a lot of them so be careful! . . Would I go there again? Yes but I would first see who is playing at XS, Marquee or Drais first as I would gladly pick anyone of them over Hakkasan.
Went here on a Friday night to see Tiesto. Bouncers were the biggest d'bags that I've ever encountered. Drinks are super expensiveand there isn't enough room to stand anywhere. Bouncers constantly push you around and don't let you hangout anywhere. Only way that I would ever go back to this club is if I was doing bottle service just to get a little space;  and even then, I'd pick a better club; XS at Wynn. Do yourself a favor and spend way less for a better  club and have yourself a lot more fun. XS isn't rated number 1 in Vegas for the hell of it; it really is. Saw Zedd at XS. 100% better experience.
Hakasma was awesome!!! Five levels of dancing fun.. Edm, Hiphop, Private Level and then lounge!! The best of all worlds.. The lines are redick!' To get in, get on a list, buy a bottle but don't just show up thinking you will walk right in, it won't happen.
Came here to see Tiesto on a Friday night.  Place was beyond capacity - i'm talking at least 500 people over what should have been allowed to go in.  Paid $85 for a ticket with a disclaimer that said, "Guaranteed entrance before 11 p.m.".  Tiesto didn't play until 2:30 a.m.  . . I'm paying $85 for a ticket.  The least they can do is reserve a spot for people who paid money in advanced. (I am aware that this is a growing trend among clubs...which is total bullshit!!!). . Anyways, got in, realized it was way too crowded (to the point where you are almost touching hands with whoever is next to you), and walked towards the back of the club.  Even though it was a little bit better, these spots were right behind the bottle service tables.  The people who had bottle service stood on their seating area (totally reasonable as they paid for it), making it impossible for anyone near the back to see the main stage.  . . Overall, pretty terrible experience as far as how the place was set up.  The sound systems weren't set up well and the sounds were piercing at times.  Visual effects were extremely mediocre. 8oz bottle of water (half of your normal water bottle) was $9. . . 1 star for Tiesto.
This club is okay. The group I came with had guest list so we didn't end up waiting too long to get in (helps that it was all girls) dance floor is fairly small however. I came here on Calvin Harris night. I love Calvin! Anyways, I asked a security guard around me for the restroom and I have no idea how or why I ended up outside of the club! LOL I couldn't get back in! I wasn't mad though. I went to the bar across and made friends! But just a little heads up for everyone! Keep your eyes open for the restroom or you WILL end up outside!. . . However! I did have a blast that night! I didn't realize the club was huge!!
I went to Hakkasan for Tiesto on a Thursday night.  We got to MGM around 11pm and the line was too long.  Which is the norm for the mega clubs in LV.  Luckily, we got in with VIP guest list.  . . I've been to Hakkasan twice.  Once in the winter and there was plenty of room.  Again, in the middle of July.  The place was insanely overcrowded.  I'm not a fan of the layout.  It's all indoors unlike XS and Surrender.  So all the smoke accumulates.  The layout did not allow an efficient flow of traffic.  Also, beware of the security guards at both ends of the dance floor.  Once, the dance floor is flooded, they won't allow party goers in.  . . One of my party wore a t shirt and got in...  I would suggest wearing a dress shirt for guys tho.  Before you come here though, ask yourself do you want to be inside all night long or do you want a venue with an indoor area and pools?  I rather go with the latter.
I echo a lot of reviewer's thoughts on this place - I'd rather suck a hobo's toes than ever set foot here again.. . My fantastic night started with my promoter chatting with my girlfriend and I on the strip. "Did you know that Hakkasan is the number 10 nightclub in the world?". . Why no I did not. . . "Would you like free entry?" . . Well sure, but I'm with a big group- 12 girls 11 guys. . . "Oh even better! Just give me your names and I'll handle everything! You'll get right in for free!". . What a great deal, promoter guy!. . Fast forward 9 hours later, and there is a clusterfuck of EPIC proportions in front the club. I'm directed to wait outside of the goddamn casino next to a Starbucks with my entire group and wait 50 minutes in the 90 degree heat in my suit. . . Which to be fair to the club and promoter, is the EXACT FUCKING OPPOSITE of the experience I was promised. . . In their generosity, the club made me two wonderful offers: . . 1. We'll take all of your girls and you guys can wait outside in this exclusive Starbucks line for another hour. . . 2. You guys can pay us 100 bucks each to get in. . . The bouncers were generally clueless assholes and after half heartedly venturing into the club,  we eventually left and went to the midget bar (Beecher's) and it was awesome. . . I hope everyone involved with this club gets scabies.
Jesse Marco? Main Act? 30 bucks? Honestly? Who contracted this guy? Worst DJ ever..."la la la"..."party people"..."la la la". Get style Mr. Marco!
So pissed of what turned out last night never had a problem here at all! The damn security kicked me out for getting a cigarette burn on me because I went to complain -about a drunk person there. I don't even want to give a star.
Best nights are Thursday and Sunday, not too packed, good deals on entry fees :) fri and sat is packed always but that's what happens when there's such a stacked line up. Id rather go to a packed club than an empty one anywaysss. Hip hop room down stairs is always poppin too:) get drinks in the lounge downstairs if you want a relief from the crowded bars in the main room
If I could give zero stars I would! Aside from the normal gender discrimination practiced here they also discriminate by ethnicity.  We saw as they pulled every white girl out of the line leaving people of color to wait. Then an Asian girl celebrating her 21st birthday was put in tears by the bouncer when she had a ticket, reservation, and table number. As she was waiting many Caucasian girls were let in. Not to mention the guys that were treated like second class citizens. This place feels like the racist, segregated south.
This is not a club it's more of an over packed corral of human beings. I came to dance, not be caned like sardines in a can that can only hop in place. This was my first time ever going to a club and it was a joke. One star just for music, it's not worth just hopping in place. Did I mention the pushing and shoving?
So.... I didn't have to stand and wait in line, luckily my husband and I got walked in.. We arrived early enough to walk around, dance without a crowd and see each room.. But when Calvin Harris started playing it was just way too crowded!. Stayed about 30 min to watch but got sick of the crowd.. Bumper to bumper.. Drinks spilling everywhere.. Beezies stopping to fix shoes in the middle of stairs.. . Looked fun for the people who had tables! . Next time...
So we went there friday night and the line was so long and the moment we got there it was packed and we had fun
We were not allowed in because they said my friend didn't look like her ID because she changed her hair color. It's a real ID. Got ready, planned this months in advance, they made a little girl cry on her 21st birthday saying she is not who she is. Her legal driver's license ID is good enough for TSA, but not good enough for Hakkasan? Bullsh*t!
I was in vegas a few nights ago and decided to try hakkasan. One of my friends knew someone who could supposedly get us in.  We got there and walked right up to the front.  I showed the guy at the door my ID which I should mention is of me about 4 years ago before I colored my hair.  I'm also from hawaii so obviously they questioned it because of the horrible superbad movie ID. The first guy asked me for another form of ID and all I had was my debit card, but I told him that I had my school and state ID in my room. After handing my ID to about 4 different guys they decided to ask me questions. They asked when my birthday was, what year I graduated from high school, how old I was when I graduated from high school, and my address.  Obviously I answered every question correctly...because it really was me.  Then they handed me my ID and said "we can't help you". I spent so much money to come to vegas for my 21st birthday and this was such a disappointment.  I spent so much money staying at the MGM with drinking eating and gambling, how could I not get in. Hakkasan was so unprofessional I don't recomend anyone going there. Take your money elsewhere, you'll have a much better time.
So I only went to one nightclub while in Vegas but I really think Hakkasan is the best.  I came here on a Thursday and a Saturday night.  . . First thing you need to know about clubbing in Vegas is that you shouldn't have to pay for tickets in advance and you don't need to pay cover in most cases.  For events that are very popular or some big name DJs then you may have to pay.  When clubbing in Vegas you need to know about using promoters to get on guest lists and get the best deal.  You can find promoters through social media, internet search or on the strip handing out business cards.  These promoters will get you on "guest lists" and in some cases limo service and VIP service.  Try and connect with the best promoters to get the best deals.  . . The first thing you want to do is show up early.  If you are just a regular off the street the line for Hakkasan will get long early.  When I say early I'm talking around 10 pm before the club even opens kind of time.  Any later you will find yourself in the "guest list" line for up to a hour and a half.  While waiting in this long line you may notice some people being picked from the line you are waiting in and taken to the front of another line.  If you pay attention you will realize why these people are selected to cut to the front of the line.  Promoters will hand pick the top of the line guests making you feel judged during the entire process as everyone is dressed to impress.  . . The Hakkasan staff does a great job of managing this line with plenty of hands on deck taking down people on the guest list with iPads.  They also have other people checking IDs and stamping your wrist for approval.  Once you do make it to the door you will be check again and sent through to the payment counter inside. Here you will hand them the pink slip that was given to you by the people who checked you in with the iPad.  If you are a MGM guest you shouldn't have to pay to get in.  Guest list also didn't require cover for us.  I'm not sure of the rules and regulations night by night but if you play your cards right you shouldn't have to pay to get in.  . . Once you are in you can either wait to take the elevator up or simply take the stairs.  There are a lot of stairs and you will realize this on your way out when you have to stumble down these flights after a night of dancing and drinking.  The middle level is the Ling Ling club.  This area is hip hop with booths in the middle and bars on the ends.  . . If you continue up to the next level you will find the main stage area of Hakkasan.  There is really no bad seat in the house.  When I say seat I mean standing/dancing spot unless you have VIP table service.  You enter directly in front of the DJ booth with stadium style set up with VIP tables on the main floor and on the second level.  There is a pit area right in front of the DJ booth for anyone to come down and dance and feel the smoke machines hit them right in the face.  . . In both areas patrons are not discouraged from standing on their booth dividers or couches and dancing.. . Drinks here are extremely expensive but I feel like everything in Vegas is.  For a weekend away I feel like you have to take this into consideration and really just let loose.  The lady and I had a Bellini and a 16 oz Bud light for $40 including tip.  At this price getting shots, mixed drinks, or even bottle service would serve as a more attractive option for party goers.  . . Hakkasan is very clean and much like the staff outside I applaud the staff in the club.  They work on keeping high traffic areas clear of people standing and they are always clearing drinks and keeping the floor clean of any spills.  It is really a controlled experience in what usually or can be an out of control club life.  . . The featured DJ set usually comes on around the 1 o'clock hour.  It really is the best club experience I have ever had.  I look forward to coming back and perhaps spending a little more on drinks during my next visit.
Most of our trips to Vegas include the usuals such as xs, marquee, tryst....but we added HK during our most recent trip to see Tiesto. Let me give you all a big hint, you will not get in easily even if you are on a promoter guest list. The line was literally outside of the hotel. So best thing to do is to have table service (which is over $5000 a night) OR just buy a ticket to get in. Lucky for us the manager got us in quick and hassle free. The dance floor was packed at first, but become more spacious when T came on. The rest was history and we had a wonderful time. After his set we went down to the third floor which was the "hip hop" level. I liked the music they had going but the crowd was very annoying which prompted us to leave early.
I planned a 40th birthday Vegas trip for a friend of mine and we planned on going to see Calvin Harris at Hakkasan on Sat. night. I worked with a VIP host to get a reservation for a table for 10 people (5 couples).  He told me to arrive early, we did, he said to speak with one of his fellow hosts to get in, we did.  What ensued, was the worst experience I have ever endured at a club.. . The area outside the club was a veritable zoo.  No clear lines, no clear signage of where to check in if you only had tickets, if you had nothing, and if you had a table.  I went to the side to speak with someone and he said he could not help me, but I needed to speak to the host.  It took me at least 45 min to get his attention (Greg I think). We spoke VERY briefly and I mentioned that we have a reservation for a table for 10 and he asked what our spend was. I told him it was $2k and he said to give him a minute.  He waled away for at least 30 minutes.  I grabbed him once again and asked what we need to do to get in. He said get in the other "line" which was more like an ocean of people. I asked if there was any other way and he hinted that it would take some greasing of his palm.  I collected what I thought was acceptable ($80) and offered it to him.  He looked down and asked, "what's that?" I said it was $80, he walked away.. . From there, I finally decided to bite the bullet and get in the "line".  After another hour or so of madness and watching others get in randomly, we decided to leave and go to XS.  What I learned from this experience, makes me pretty sick.  First, nothing is guaranteed, no matter how much money you are planning on spending. Two, if you plan on going to this club, be prepared to pay an extra $300-$500 to bribe the host to get you in.  Now, I am all for tipping, but when you are about to spend thousands of dollars at a table to have fun for a night, there should be no need to add a bribe to that.  . . I don't care if I sound naive or cheap, but that is complete BS.  People come to Vegas from all over the country and the world to experience Vegas nightlife.  If this is the norm, someone should at least tell the future guests that the only way to get in is to grease some palms with multiple Benjamins.. . Lastly, to clear up any questions, they were not even letting in groups of smoking hot women.  I am at a loss.. . LAME
Overcrowded!! No place to sit down unless you pay $$$$. Main stage super small for the amount of people in the club. Even to see a good dj is not worth the hand greasing, sardine like stage and waiting to get an overpriced cocktail!!
VIP means you have to Stand in line for 2 hours. I should know better, but dont trust a promoter, especially Shawn.
I remember talking to the security gaurd about this place and he convinced me to go in. So I did. paid $40, while everyone else didnt but whatever.. . Place was bumpin then 2 hours later people were hammered and everyone was dancing on the platforms or whatever you wanna call them. I had a long drive the next day so I left aroun 3:30am (wimpy I know). . . Then I realized I completely forgot about the hip hop floor to this place. So I never saw that. I just went and got more johnny rockets which was stupid too.
