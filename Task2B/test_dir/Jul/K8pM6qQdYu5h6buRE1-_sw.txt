Best chicken in town!! Great decor and service was excellent!!!
I went with the idea of trying everything I could and trying not to compare it with Sylvia's in Harlem or any place on New Orleans. Well imagine my surprise when Lolo's in Phoenix, AZ wins BY A HUGE MARGIN!!! . No comparison!! Food, quick service, friendliness of staff, and CLEAN! My OCD didn't kick in at all? Don't let the outside appearance or area scare you off. It is beautiful and rustic inside and just an overall great place to eat!!! I WILL be back!
Ok- chicken and waffles may sound wierd, but so did chocolate and peanut butter before you tried it......MY girl and i went there on 7/5/14 and have been a few times before.  Seriously, i dont even like fried chicken and there's is AMAZING ! Not greasy, the outside is delicious, tender inside, juicy and the waffles are simply perfect.  Threw down some cheesy grits, too. I have wanted to order other things off the menu, but the chicken and waffles is so good, i cant deviate from it.  Plus, they are super efficient and organized.Service is very, very good.  It will be busy when you go, so expect a wait.  But they move people in and out effectively and the place is immaculate.  Probably one of the cleanest restaurants ever.
Had lunch there today, 40 min wait but then they offered up the patio right away. Wasn't too unbearable with the misters. . . Got our dranks quickly, however due to me ordering a cheeseburger the food delivery took about 40 minutes.. . Food was good, not to die for though. Won't order the Mac and cheese again.. . Wife ordered chicken and waffle.  Said was good, likes the thin waffles. . . Ordered the red velvet cake for myself, not impressed. Maybe it wasn't made recently, very dry. Definitely not as good as Grandma made it.. . We'd probably go back again, but not right away.
Finally had the chance to try lolos chicken and waffles this past sunday! I have mixed feelings about this place. . . 1. The chicken and waffles were yummy! . . 2. The wait when ordering a burger is ridiculous.  We waited about 40 minutes for our food to come out just because my husband ordered a burger.. . 3. We spend $11 on dessert to go (red velvet & banana pudding), both were extremely dry. The pictures totally gave us false hope. I seriously think the desserts were a week old at least. . . 4. The mac and cheese was okay, nothing special. . . I would return but it's not a place I would go out of my way for.. . P.s ~ be prepared to wait 30-40 minutes for a table on a sunday afternoon.
This is one of my favorite places!! They have the best chicken and waffles you will ever eat!! And really good corn bread
You have got to be kidding me, $14 for a chicken breast, small at that, two wings and two sides! This was our second visit to Lo Lo's, the first being in the old location behind the parking lot, I don't think we will have a third visit, too costly for what you get and the quality of the chicken. The sides are good enough but I demand better value for my money.
Such a fun place!!! Food is delicious. Bottom line. Make sure to share sides so you get to try them all! Drinks are sugar filled in giant mason jars and chicken is juicy. Love the atmosphere and very worth the wait!
I.had the lolo plate.fried.chicken and.waffles with koolaid.it was good oh and.a side corn.bread,waffles tastes good chickn is good and.the  corn bread isnt.dry. waitresses were very pretty and polite.family liked the.music.they play, good atmosphere.ill be back to try.their other dishes.nothing bad to say about LoLo's
Service is okay. Mac n cheese sucked, noodles were mushy and it was chalky. The Catfish was bland. The chicken and gravy was good, and the Kool aid in the jars was kinda cool and unique. Overall, disappointed.
This place was worth the hype.  Excellent chicken and waffles.  Quick friendly staff.  My pink drank was always full and my server  Charrae asked several times if we were ok.
Best Gizzards I've had since I was a kid. Delicious.  Our server was awesome too. Thanks Brad!!
Its good, but not so good that I would make it a main stay in my restaurant experience.  I got the chicken and waffles (obviously) and the purple drank... Also got the banana pudding.  It was all good, but not mind blowing. . Loved the atmosphere though and the staff are a delight.  It is a place that you have to check out, but obviously not the most healthy place in the world!
I've worked downtown for years now and have always heard about this place. We went during lunch time and there was only valet parking, no regular parking which I thought was odd. You can park on the side street which we did but only after we waited on the single valet to park 2 cars that were blocking us. He was working hard but he was just the only valet there. Free but of course you gotta tip the guy. The chicken tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a bit or just wasn't made corrently. The homemade hot sauce is amazing. Like most down home fried chicken places they're a little expensive. We put in a order for the three of us to go and is was almost $50. Just standard 3 pc meals, not their most expensive plate options. This place is always packed and people rave about it so I don't want to say never go there but my individual visit wasn't what I hoped for. I may give it another shot because I love good home style friend chicken and hot sauce. Waffles were excellent though!
Amazing dinner amazing service. Joseph was a great server the banana pudding was a great dessert to finish off our celebration.
