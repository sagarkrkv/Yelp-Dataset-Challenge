During a work outing after a hard week, we stopped by to grab dinner on the boss and boy would I have payed double whatever the bill was!  Everything was awesome!! The server seemed quiet but it was a larger group so the need to stop by was frequent and I think she didn't want to keep interrupting which I find to be a great quality.  Nothing worse than a server popping in Avery 5 minutes asking if everyone is ok.... Except a server that never pops in I suppose lol.  But she was great.  The food was awesome. The place wasn't too loud and someone else paid for the meal!  Can't go wrong with any of that!!
Great food, great service, and worth every dollar.  Came here at the end of our multi-state, multi-canyon tour and had to find a restaurant that was open late since we'd be arriving at Phoenix late.  The Mission was a great find.  The food was bursting with flavors and Jemar, our server, was friendly and knowledgeable.  Would definitely come here again the next time we come in town.  The only reason I took off one star was because it's a bit noisy for us.
Second time here last Sunday, and pretty sure I got a mild intestinal bug (as did my husband). Ugh. The Sunday brunch pig out is the likely culprit.
Food and wine abound here. The outside is charming an looks like an old Spanish mission so the name is appropriate. There is a parking lot directly across the street if you can't find parking in front. The bar is very nice and the bartenders very attentive. I'm a red wine lover and the selection is decent. The place is candle lit and very romantic if you're in need of a date destination. It's nice to have a drink at the bar while munching in some table side guacamole (highly recommended). The patio is a different feel and is awesome if the weather is nice. I ordered the pork shoulder and green pozole. They also have an amazing kale salad (I'm a sucker for kale). Definitely go when you have time and not in a rush. If it's not too packed the bar is a gem.
Having only sampled  the appetizers / small plates can't comment on the signature dishes but the services is great, bar area is comfy if not at times crowded and the patio is great, the few items I've tried were very good.
Wonderful service, atmosphere, and menu. The "missionary" is half margarita/red sangria- unique and very good. I have had a great experience every time I've gone.
Quite possibly the best drinks I've ever had.  As a Seattle guy, I miss it already.  Great service and beautiful decor inside and out.  Can't remember the names of our servers, but I wish I could give you huge kudos.  Next time, we shall.
I went here on the 4th of July, which was an extremely busy night. Most of the restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale were closed for the holiday, but luckily we found this gem. Ordinarily we wouldn't have been able to get seated quickly without a reservation, but they had a table for two opened up that they said was reserved in an hour and a half, which is plenty enough for dinner. . . The service was great and quick. We got the tableside guacamole to start, which was prepared right in front of us! Our main course arrived about 30 seconds after the guacamole was finished, which was strange, but we didn't complain. We got the pork shoulder tacos which comes with corn tortillas on a salt block. I found this a really interesting concept. You would just rub the tortilla on the block and the salt would transfer. The pork was so juicy and the sweet sauce that came with it was divine. We ordered the Guatemalan chocolate pastilla, which was probably the most unpleasant part of the meal, even though it tasted fine. It sort of looked like poop, which was unnerving. Lol. But the rest of the food was amazing, and I definitely would recommend this place. Pricey, but worth it.
The Mission is brought to you by the same people as House Brasserie and it shows! . . The tableside guacamole is unbelievable.. . Anything involving the pork shoulder on the menu is a winner. They slow roast it for 12 hours and it's somewhat of a signature.. . The white bean puree side is absolutely fantastic, must get it.
Highly recommended for Latin American food, but make reservations.  We went for dinner on 4th of July.   The dining area was pretty dark, but I later realized it was because we were outside and our eyes needed time to adjust.  I loved the black chandeliers everywhere.  Very lively atmosphere.. . I started off with the Watermelon Basil mojito.  Very refreshing!  The table next to us had ordered the tableside guacamole so although we had chips, salsa and guacamole for a snack earlier in the day, we had to get some.   We ordered medium spice and it had a good kick to it.  They do make it in front of you and for 2 people, it was a whole lot of guacamole!  . . For appetizers, we ordered the Duck Confit Empanadas, which ended up sounding better than it tasted.  It was not the pie crust dough like most empanadas.  Instead, it was like crispy wontons.  The crust was overcooked and it came with a sweet sauce so I felt like I was eating Chinese food instead of Latin American.  That was a disappointment!. . By then, we were pretty full so although we ordered two types of tacos, we ended up canceling one.  We just had the Mahi Mahi tacos which were Tecata battered with a nice sauce.  It came with 3 street size tacos.  It was delicious.  The table next to us ordered the Pork Shoulder tacos which serves for 2.  That looked good as well as it came with a whole chunk of braised pork.  If we were hungry, we would have ordered that.  . . Overall, service was great.  Enjoyed most of the food and drinks.  If it wasn't for the duck empanadas, I would have given them 5 stars.
Love this place!  The atmosphere is gorgeous. Great place for a date or evening out with girlfriends. It's a bit noisy but the vibe is very lively and trendy. The food is sooo good. It's upscale Latin food. Everything on the menu is amazing. Pork tacos are delicious and the drinks are tasty.
Went here w/ a group of friends right before closing time, but the staff was still very friendly and willing to hang out late so we could eat. . . The table side guacamole is a MUST! I consider myself somewhat of a guac expert and I have never had it any better!  I thoroughly enjoyed the steak tacos. The meat had the most amazing flavor!. . Primarita was a great, skinny margarita!
Enjoyed dinner here for the second time. Small restaurant focused on customer service. This gourmet Mexican food touches the pallet in a delectable fashion. The salsa is fresh; you can choose from mild, medium, hot, verde, and chipotle. The mahi mahi tacos come grilled or breaded. The Alaskan halibut was cooked perfectly. The server studied the menu well and was able to answer all the questions at the table with ease. Great location in the heart of old town. Car service is always ready outside. Great for a relaxing evening, or a good dinner before a night on the town.
Loved the atmosphere and the table side guacamole!  The wait was a pain although it was a Friday night so i was asking for it! Service was great despite how busy they were! Definitely recommend! Will return soon!
On a business trip and our hotel recommended the mission. It lived up to the hype, we had table side guacamole and salsa, then went for the torreados (I think I'm still sweating), and then got down on a brisket tortas which had a great blend of flavors. . A little pricey for lunch though.
My first experience at The Mission was awesome. Great food, fast service but it was pitch black in the restaurant, we had to use a flashlight to read the menu. My fiance and I each got a couple margaritas, we split the table side guacamole then ended with the pork shoulder for two. We ate about half of the entree due to filling up on  the guacamole. The guacamole is a must, it's easily the best I've ever had, plus it's fun watching it being made. The margaritas were just ok. The pork tacos were fantastic and a ton of food. We liked it so much, we made another reservation as we were leaving. This past weekend I took my fiance, and future mother and sister in law. The food was good but the portion sizes were inconsistent with our first visit. Also, we paid 100 bucks for 4 drinks, table side guacamole and tacos for two. The food and decor is great. It's really tough to beat. The place is fairly small so you need to get a reservation well in advance, we made many attempts to get a table before we finally went.
Just moved here from the east coast, and came to the mission as a sort of celebratory dinner with my family. I could not have been more pleased with the service AND the food. The meats are delectable and the bread pudding is phenomenal.
I've been here about 10 times and I would have to say the quality has really dropped dramatically in the last month or so really disappointed I'll try back in a month or 2 because I really want to like this place
