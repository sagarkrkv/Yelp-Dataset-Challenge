From the get-go, this place's customer service sucks. The cashier kept questioning me when I tried redeeming my $25.00 voucher offer. (The only reason why I was here). After verifying who I was and my age multiple times, I was then seated at my table in a very isolated section of the restaurant next to where to what seemed to be the dish washing area/drink refilling station. I came alone, and this just made me feel even lonelier. . Afterwards I was greeted by a very polite server, who served me my drink. He was very courteous and welcoming, unfortunately I only saw him once......then briefly for a drink refill. After that, everyone was giving me a frown when asking for a refill. Now I was just feeling uncomfortable. . The food selection was spread out around the restaurant according to the country of origin. If I wanted American food, I was within easy access. If I wanted chicken noodle soup, I would have to make a trek across the restaurant with a very hot plate in hand, with a bunch of people running straight at me. The food is no different than that of a hometown buffet, at times I felt like I was at one of those international buffets for 6.99 that you go into knowing your stomach was going to have a party afterwards, but this is $32.00!!!!!! I only paid 7.00 thanks to my voucher but even then I felt I over paid because this place was horrible.
Honestly, i enjoyed the food the last two times ive gone. But ive had their wine twice with my meal and ive gotten very sick afterwards to the point i vomit and don't eat until very late. I would say it is overpriced but arent all buffets expensive.
We arrived a little after 3pm with a group of 20, including 16 with Special Needs.  No line, plenty of empty tables and we gave our Groupons and had to pay $2.49 per person extra ( tax?).  They wanted us to pay $100 for gratuity to sit together in the same EMPTY area; another union rule.   More later on that.  I said no problem, we aren't moving since we were already seated, but told them they just lost any additional tip we were planning on leaving above the $100.  This is union policy, I was told again.  Well, keep your union policies.   Those are the workers the union protects..  Good for the union.  The service was awful, the food was just as bad and I would never recommend this place to anybody who has any food taste/class.   As soon as we finished, I had two vomit ( un- sweetened tea must have been off temperature).   None of us ate more than a bit of anything.  Most items weren't labeled so the one with a seafood allergy, ended up with seafood in the pasta.   Not labeled.   Chicken Noodle Soup isn't a selection of soup.  It was the only choice.   Desserts were just awful.   The best was the Ice Cream and it can from a machine.   Don't go,  not recommended; rather stay hungry than eat this rubbish.  Service was terrible, but then again, unions only hire the best workers...wrong...least motivated.... yes!   Fool me once...Never again.
This was a pretty good buffet.  We got there around 5 so just before dinner time rush.  It is a kind of weird set up where you wait in line to buy the buffet then get into another line to wait to be seated.  All in all took us 10-15 minutes to be seated.  The buffet is separated by region.  There is Italian, Mexican, soup, salad, Greek, seafood and dessert.  There was some good food and some not so good food but all in all it was tasty.  The service was pretty slow but they only had one server covering a large area. At one point a server and bus boy were having an argument and management had to come out and take care of it.  They handled everything right out on the floor which I thought was neither the time not place for that right next to our table.
Wow, even with low expectations, this place was awful.  There was over an hour wait, the waiting area was hot, and the food was actually bad.  Not just "not good" - it was bad.  We choked down some pasta and left asap.  Even with a Groupon, we felt like it was abad decision.
Simply stated, not worth it by Vegas standards.. My wife bought a groupon for 2 for $46.. . The good:. We were seated rather quickly.  The service was pretty good.  Our table server was attentive and filled our waters and drinks pretty quickly.  . . The bad. The restaurant was not exceptionally clean.  There were a number of tables that had not been cleaned and were waiting to be bussed.. The restaurant has a strange layout.  The food is spread over a rather large area and broke into sections.  It gives a rather odd sense of not really knowing completely what is available.. . The disappointing. The food quality overall is just average at best.  There were a few things that were pretty good, however generally this buffet is similar to any international buffet in my hometown that you could go to for $15 or $20.  The crab legs were cold and clearly a smaller size than some of the other buffets in Vegas.  The sushi is terrible.  There was an abundance of low cost pasta dishes etc that fill you up, but are not very distinguishable etc.. . Ultimately, my meal wasn't awful, however I wouldn't return.  I only get the opportunity to go to Vegas once in a while, during my limited time there I rather go to one of the premier buffets.  Clearly, those buffets are more expensive, however I left feeling disappointed that I didn't take the opportunity to eat at a nicer place.  . . This place would be ideal for broke college students trying to fill their stomachs as inexpensive as possible with cheap food and all you can drink.
How this place won  6 yrs in row Best Buffet Award, is beyond me.. . Mediocre at best, I would not waste money in here, many more choices  to go to.
We came here by accident. I thought buffets of the buffets was in planet Hollywood. Since we were already here and starving we decided to give it a try. We came here around 5:30 for dinner. Dinner price was $40. The inside is small for a buffet. . . The food was okay. I expected a little better. They had a choice is sea food, italian, American, Asian, middle eastern, and Mexican. They also had a very big dessert area. . . I tried the following:. . Sea food. . -Sushi- a little hard not very good. They had a veggie roll, spicy tuna and California roll. . -Cocktail shrimp- decent . . -Crawfish with rice- pretty good . . -Crab legs- really good I had a whole plate of them. . Shrimp penne with pesto- really good a must try . . Crab pasta Alfredo- really creamy and delicious. . Italian. . -Pepperoni pizza slice- okay I could've probably skipped out on this . . -Blacked chicken pasta-  so good . . -Parmesan garlic wings- really great taste . . American. . -Pork loin- so juicy and amazing flavor . . -Steak- amazing it's cooked a little rare but it was just perfect . . -Mac and cheese- it was alright just had about 2 spoons . . Asian. . Low mein- not a fan it was a little flavor less . . Fried rice- was good but definitely have had better . . Egg roll- good . . Over all the food was okay. I would've rather paid $10 to Wicked Spoon. The good here just seemed like they heated it up in the microwave. . . The service was good. I left happy and stuffed which is what I wanted.
I'll start off by saying I'd rate the food 4 stars but 0 for customer service. This place has an insanely long line during dinner. Just when you get all excited and pay, and just when you think you're finally going to get to eat....BAM! Another long line just to be seated. On this second line they basically seat you the way they like, even though you're first in line they can pick anybody that behind you based on party number. Maybe if my husband and I had 4 imaginary friends we could've sat sooner instead of having like 4 different groups that were way behind in line, get seated before us.. I can definitely appreciate that all the food types visibly  labeled throughout the buffet but this layout made searching for good exhausting. I practically didn't realize there was an entire other half of stuff available until my husband kept returning to the table with new items that I had misssd. When we finally sat at our table I was on my second plate before a waiter finally showed up. He showed up while I was chewing my food and noticed it was taking me a bit so he decided he was going to continue to a different table.  This just about pissed me off and I had to flag him back to our table. After this initial encounter he never came back to check on us. Upon leaving we noticed a multitude of  vacant tables with yet still a long line. The ribs, fruit tarts, paella, and several other food Items were the jam. I am hesitant to give this place a second chance. Sadly, terrific food does not make up for piss poor customer service.. P.s...did anyone figure out where the ketchup was? There were like 3 different bowls of marinara sauce but not one for ketchup?
Fast line for the food since it's a Tuesday. Went here for lunch and I'd recommend this for people who love to eat American/ comfort foods. Fish and chips, ribs, and quesadillas. Definitely try their couscous!!! So delicious the flavors exploded in my mouth. Top it off with their glazed carrots. Waiter was kind but kinda slow. It's okay since the buffet was $20/ person. They have lots of pasta like seriously lots. Lasagna, mac and cheese, penne pesto, pizza, etc! Plus lots of vegetarian choices including Mexican. I dare you to make yourself a milkshake. Ask the waiter for a  separate cup and run to the dessert section. Their vanilla soft serve is surprisingly different and creamier. Toppings are glazed strawberries, Oreos, and Heath. My favorite. Put strawberries on the bottom of the cup then swirl up the vanilla ice cream til the top and put more strawberries and finish it with whipped cream. Try it!!!! They have a lot of cupcakes too. It's decent. Go for the couscous.
There are a few good things, there are very few great things, but there are a whole lot of things and they never run out! The seafood is decent, and I can never resist a red slab of prime rib...or two...or three. This buffet wouldn't be my first choice, but we got the 24-hour pass, which is a pretty sweet all-you-can-gorge deal. Hey, there are worse ways to end a Vegas meal than a cupcake and a little creme brulee...
I was there during the 4th of July weekend,  worst buffet In Las Vegas,  $40.00/pp, drinks are extra.
This buffet has to be one of my favorite buffets to go to in Las Vegas. There is a little bit of wait. It's always crowded but the food is worth the wait!!!
The staff here was awful! There was a huge line and four people just standing around not helping anyone. We even asked what the problem was and were informed that only one person was qualified to operate the register. Once we were seated, twenty minutes later with only a couple in front of us, the waitress we had was in a poor mood and not polite at all. I will say that the food was great, minus the American section, but it was quite pricy. The help at this restaurant definitely ruined the experience and we will not be returning.
Decent Buffett. Great number of choices and food was fresh.  The all you can drink option definitely differentiates the buffet.  Would go back.
I'm not sure what everyone is talking about when they refer to the quality of the food. We went at lunch for the Groupon deal which included 37.98 for all you can drink for two with your two buffet entries. Even before we got there the price alone sold us. . . When we arrived we had a short wait in line, nothing too crazy. Were seated quickly and immediately hopped on the food line. Oh boy was I impressed with the selection. . . The middle eastern section was by far my favorite, and this is mainly because I've found it extremely hard to find a buffet that can pull it off correctly. But this is the one!. As far as the American food... Two must haves - Mac and Cheese, and their Au Gratin Garlic Potatoes...Wow, was I drooling right after our meal.... . One thing that does annoy me about the Soup bars here in Vegas, its almost always Chicken noodle and Minestrone wherever we go. How about some Tomato Bisque or Broccoli Cheddar soup! Variety!. . The only negative things I would say is that there service was decent. Nothing spectacular from our server but nothing terrible so it was slightly above average.  He could have been a bit better but was personal and didn't get behind even though they started getting busy. Even though gratuity was included with our deal, we still tipped....even though he was Patriots fan haha.. . All in all,  you can't beat the price and compared to the other buffets on the strip, this one didn't fall short on food category for myself! TRY IT!
