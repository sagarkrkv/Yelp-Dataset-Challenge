Terminal 4 is the best!  Yummy food is abundant when you have downtime.. . Check out the priority club in terminal 2, also.  It's okay to wear jeans and a t-shirt here (it is Phoenix after all).. . Try to ignore the often grouchy TSA and check-in staff.
going thru customs was SUPER easy! Great food in the terminal as I waited for my connecting flight, sweet people. clean [but dated] airport. great job, Pheonix!
It has become the airlines that cater to dogs better than they do people. I have severe allergies to pets.  I don't mind changing my flight for a real service animal but it has become a fad to get a small dog and call it a service animal. Every month I take a flight and every month it have to change my flights due to "service animals" on the plane. People with pets are not required to inform the airlines in advance that they will be traveling with pets. So I end up being delayed (24 hours so far this time), Every flight today had pets. It triggers inflammation in my airways. It's not a matter of sneezing. When I book my flight I inform them that I need a wheelchair to get to the gate, why can't people inform the airlines when traveling with pets. We are crammed in like cattle and now we people have to share the air and small space with animals.
Had I written this review three years ago, I would have given Sky Harbor 4-5 stars.  But now?  Not so much.  Something has happened with airline routes because no matter when you fly through here, it's ridiculously crowded.  It now reminds me of Dulles or Newark when I make my way through the mass of people.  It's too bad, because this used to be a pretty nice airport.  Flying here?  Prepare for frustration!
I've flown in and out of Sky Harbor many times. It's a pretty well laid out airport, and making connectors is pretty much a snap because of the super fast people movers that wisp you away to this and that gate area. . . I was there not too long ago and had an early morning 1.5 hour layover. Ate at a typical Tex-Mex place that served chorizo and scrambled eggs. Quite tasty and I like how they mix in plenty of restaurants around the gate areas. . . It's a big and busy airport, but navigating it is very straight forward. If I'm heading out West, this is an airport that I don't mind hanging in if I have to have a layover. It features free wi-fi that seemed to work wherever I went. The airport and it's bathrooms are very clean and well maintained. . . A word to the wise: if you are running a low battery on your electronic devices, you're better off sitting down at a restaurant and trying to find a wall outlet to mooch power from than you are trying to find an available outlet at the gate area. They are few and far between at the gates and you can almost rest assured someone has beaten you to the punch in using it. So I usually go into a restaurant, scope out an outlet near a table or a booth, sit down and use that. Of course, just to be courteous, I'll order something to eat to make it fair. I haven't had to go through the TSA checkpoint since I only land there to connect elsewhere, so I can't comment on that fun experience.
Great airport deco shops and food . Easy to find your way too.. Covered parking is no problem
I paid for precheck, but apparently you have to get here at the right time. Only works 75%. So, had to wait in line and dig out my liquids and laptop. They let me keep my shoes on. The precheck line was closed today, even though there were about 15 of them seemingly unoccupied. This review may result in more thorough checks from now on. NSA / TSA. Paranoid.
This is one of the better airports for business travel that I've been to.  I like that they have dashes of historical memorabilia throughout the airport. Appreciate that they have people movers. You get in, you get out, no serious issues.. . Can't give 5 stars to any airport without abundant napping pods, of course.
A small, but nice airport, except when it comes to the USAIR wing, A17 - 30, where I was at.  At one end, you had modern conviences like charging stations, but at the end where i was, A29, you had very few plugs. Very few places to charge anything. . . They are currently renovating the restrooms, so that's a plus. Soon you won't have to trek all the way to the end to use the toilet, you'll have a modern convenience down at the butt end, so that's a plus.
Friendly staff, clean and typically pretty quick security lines. They are making an intentional effort to have only local restaurants (at least in terminal 4) and prices are the same as they are outside of the airport. Shame it's my home airport because I'd be thrilled to eat at these restaurants.
Sky harbor in general is good but terminal 2- not much of anything. Limited restaurants and only few flights that fly out there. If you coming to terminal 2, then plan on not waiting out here too long.
A nice airport that gets you in and out quick.  It is easy to get around in this airport without getting lost.
I love AZ (I'm a native), but this is not my favorite airport. . The positives: modern, selection of restaurants (before you pass security), lots of places to shop. They have navigators to help travelers know where to go. They also have helpers (for tips) to assist you in carrying your luggage. Not every airport has these helpful folks. Great if you're healing up from an injury or are disabled (why do I know this?). The negatives: Hoofing it from one concourse to another for flight connections (at least they have those people-moving carts that get you there fast). TSA pre-check is frequently closed here. In some concourses, not much to choose from for eating. Not enough charging stations in any gate I have flown out of. They could improve the cleanliness a bit.
It's a reasonably well laid out airport, and you can take off.  You can land.  You can come and you can go.  It works.. But you'd better speak ENGLISH.  It's shocking that in an "International" major city airport ALL signs and announcements are in English only -- coming into the airport, parking, on the SkyTrain, in the terminals, at the gates.  Is this Phoenix's way of letting foreigners know they really are not welcome in Arizona?  I felt so sorry for many very lost, confused, foreign visitors I saw trying to find their way around. Shame on you, Phoenix! "The world's friendliest airport?"  I don't think so.
I traveled thru this airport quite a bit. It's a nice small airport and it's efficient. I never had to wait and this is probably one of the friendliest airports I have experienced. The TSA & Airport employees are generally friendly. It caught me off guard when the TSA welcomes you with a friendly attitude instead of shouting orders at you like at other bigger international airports. I generally don't have a problem. . . Some terminals don't have a 24/7 food service available. One time I got at the airport around 9pm or so and no restaurants were open, which sucked. I had to resort to buying 2 bags of chips. bleh. But other than that I don't mind this airport at all.
I've been pretty happy with Sky Harbor.  Terminal 2 is the older, small terminal.  It's smaller and there's not a lot of options for food.  It is nice for people who don't like a lot of big crowds though.  I flew out of there early one morning and saw about 10 people.  That was nice. . Terminal 4 has the best selection for food, but it's the busiest and most crowded terminal.  . . Overall it's fine.  It could be better, but it gets me where I want to go.
Pathetic... one bathroom for for gates B1-14. Been to third world airports that are better!
I've been to better county airports. Every time I come here it's another experience to forget. I remember almost missing a flight because I stood In line for Delta, I was pulled out of line (the front) to use a kiosk by an employee, I then had to get back in line (The back) to check in my bag.That's why I was in line morons! I know how to self check in....   The only airport I've ever been to where I had to wait over 30 minutes to use the men's restroom.   One thing after another.
Traveling through Phoenix Sky Harbor has been one of the best airports I have visited in the US. The airport is very clean, the staff members friendly, there are great food options throughout the airport, and going through security is never a hassle.. . Lets face it, no one likes going to the airport, but throughout all of my visits to Sky Harbor I have always had a pleasurable experience. The airport is located very close to downtown and only takes minutes to get to. Since it is so close it is not a hassle for friends to do a quick drop-off or pick-up from the airport. Additionally, a cab fare does not cost very much to get there and if cabs are out of your price range then you can always take the Light Rail to the 44th St. stop. From that stop thatSky Rail takes you straight to your terminal (T5 coming in 2015). I love the location of Sky Harbor and how easy it is to get there.. . My favorite part about SH has to be the short wait times at security. Only once have I ever had to wait more than 15 minutes to make it through the entire line. These TSA agents mean business and do their jobs very efficiently. For those with worse luck than me or less patients I would recommend getting TSA Pre-Check approval. This allows you to cut the majority of the line while going through security. Another perk is that you do not have to remove and items from your bag (including laptops, liquids) and you do not have to remove your shoes, belts, or jackets. It is the BEST! If you apply and are approved it is good for 5 years. The app is $85 and you give them permission to do a background cheek and finger printing.. . The only reason will not give SH the full five star rating is because I have visited some pretty extravagant airports before in the Middle East that made me realize that most airports in the US are missing a cultural and artistic value. SH does have a number of great artist that have contributed to its design but nothing that was breath taking like I have seen elsewhere.. . Great airport! Four stars!
One star for the free Wi-Fi.. . Worst airport that I have to travel too:. . 1.  Takes for ever to get you bag.  Took over one hour AND we had no idea what carousel our flights bags were coming out on.  1, than 3, than back to one.  . 2. Going through security is a complete joke, especially if you are flying out of B.  One long line, 1 lane open, and their answer to solve the problem?  Letting us know we could go through C.  Took one hour to get through security.. 3.  Terminal B is to crowded (especially, Gates 10-14).  All flights arrive around the same time, and depart around the same time.  Creates so much confusion, that adds stress to the experience.. . Did I say they have free Wi-Fi?
fast check in....local eateries....quick security lines....clean bathrooms....flying somewhere fun....what's not to love?!
Our flight was on time! That right there is enough to give any airport at least 3 stars. On top of that, we ran into no problems with anything! Even the TSA agents were friendly, which is totally unusual yet very much appreciated! There's not much as far as food is concerned if you go in the morning; make sure you aren't even the slightest bit hungry before going because there's nothing really to eat. Both my dog and I had a positive experience. Way to go, Phoenix!
Landed here for what was meant to be a short layover, but instead had the opportunity to experience the Airport for 4 hours.  Each concourse had a the usual variety of snack shops/news stands and eateries.  These included the staple McDonalds and Wendy's but also a Pei Wei, La Madeline, and others. As we walked the terminals we saw a variety of employees, security, janitorial, and airline personnel in action.  All were pleasant and helpful to the passengers.
The car rental pickup is a bit of a distance away from the terminal. You'll need to hop on a bus for 10 minutes to get there which makes car rental returns a bit time consuming. The terminal and car rental areas are always busy and very clean. Staff was friendly in helping with bags. Our flight had to wait more then 10 minutes for the luggage to arrive.
I've flown in and out of this airport a few times now to and from San Jose Mineta and it's one of the easiest places to navigate especially for someone like me who is not very good at direction.  They've got employees spread throughout the baggage claim area as well who can tell you where to go just in case you get lost.  When my friend Lindsay asked me if I was exiting North or South of the baggage claim area, I walked straight to the employee who was clearly there just for me.  She happily set me straight so that I knew which exit was South.  Bingo.  I was all set to greet AZ and have an awesome weekend with friends.
Pros: . 1. Helpful people are in the busy parts of the airport. 2. Above average food, coffee, and souvenir selections. 3. Despite having to go through security just to connect to another flight, it was run efficiently and humanely . . Cons: . 1. There are multiple terminals- how one is supposed to know that when connecting is unclear. 2. Connecting flight gate information is not displayed if it's outside the terminal you are currently in(!). 3. Scant if any assistance in the outer, more neglected terminals. 4. Necessary to walk longdistances outdoors to a bus to get you across airport. 5. You have to go through security again if your connecting flight is in another terminal (!)
This is a bustling airport so be prepared to move quickly when necessary. Baggage claim was easy peasy, check-in on return was a breeze and security flew by also. . . The gate that I left from was stacked with people so find a nice spot to sit until pre-boarding and don't move otherwise someone will steal your seat and you'll be standing or sitting at a gate further away.. . The restaurants in the area of C3 looked inviting and they had some tasty offerings, above and beyond what I'm used to seeing in Detroit anyway. Sandwiches, pizzas and taquitos if memory serves me....just a few nice options while you're waiting.
Dropped off my cousin here for their flight to California. The parking is not a hassle and a lot of things has changed since I remembered back in high school. Everything was under construction, caution tape everywhere, and just looked unappealing. Taking the time to actually tour around the place it is pretty nice and impressive. You got a variety of stores, lounging areas, and of course the restaurants. Very nice because it is still improving and still building more restaurants there. . . The baggage and check in stations are very easy to do and don't need much help. That is a big part for me because airports can be very busy so the less time checking in the better. So, overall, I'd have to say even though I haven't been to a lot of airports Sky Harbor by far has to be one of the best in categories rangingfrom being clean, exceptional service, and having a variety of stores/restaurants.
Not a fan of this airport for one reason. There are very few ways to charge anything. Lots of chairs but no outlets. Not sure how such a busy airport can have such few options. Security was also a little strange I had pre-check which got me into a different line but then we just merged with everyone else. How does so much of the general public qualify for the pre-check line. It's not as bad as Midways system but it's up there.  Also I know it's 120 outside but does it have to be 90 on the inside?
I was in this airport for a long time on a layover, because my Southwest flight got delayed 3 hours.  I can't comment on the TSA checkpoints or the baggage cliam area. . We were around terminal D on a Saturday evening, when all of a sudden most restaurants and stores started closing at 6. SIX PM, are you kidding me?  It's a huge airport and they close early on Saturdays.. . The food choices aren't terrible, the cafe "La Grande Orange" did stay open past 6 with salad, sandwiches, pizzas and burger choices.  The terminals are spacious and somewhat clean.  There are limited areas where you can connect your phone or laptop, as opposed to other major or even smaller airports.. . The bathrooms are clean and smell clean which I think is important for women. I would give this airport 3 1/2 stars overall, but I'll round down.
For me, it's a layover stop. Southwest stops on the way to SF or LA... What I appreciate about airports is the coffee, healthy options and ease of use. I can't talk. About TSA, but they have great healthy options (nice salads just order dressing and cheese on the side) at the Paradise Bakery & Cafe. You can also get good Mexican @ the place next to it. (C terminal). . Good seats - the plush lounger type with the plugs at every seat. Not all have them but there are some. But I like to be a rockstar and carry my own power strip when I travel (which is too often) and make friends and fans wherever I go.
Sky Harbor is one of the most user-friendly airports I've been to.  For an international airport that's located in the 6th largest city in the U.S., it handles all the passengers pretty well.  My bias aside (Arizona resident), I really like the ease and amenities it offers.  Free wi-fi is one of the amenities and I feel it should be offered free at every airport.
For frequent delays out of this airport, at least they have decent food to keep you satiated and decent air conditioning by the gates to keep you cool and protected from the dry desert elements. I always find nice golf shirts for my dad here and interesting southwest art to peruse during the wait. There is some pottery that is made in extreme heat conditions as well as typical Oaxacan figurines that are very affordably priced. Airport monitors here are small and outdated, but they do the job they're meant to do. The trek between the C gates and D gates is relatively painless - just a few moving walkways to move you between the two wings. If you're a female in yoga pants and runners, you may feel underdressed next to fabulous looking women, who are tan and perfectly done up like they're off to the country club or an LA hotspot. Although I dislike the landings and takeoffs from this airport, it is really hard to avoid transfers through here on Southwest. At least the time on the ground is pleasant here.
I travel all over the country on business and Sky Harbor is positively the best. So many restraints and bars that all will be happy. Prices are good on food and drink too. Free wifi is fast and there are charging stations everywhere.
