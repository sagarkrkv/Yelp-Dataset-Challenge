I really like this airport and when I need to connect I try to go through CLT.  You have a huge central area where the 5 other terminals connect through.  They have plenty of fast walks throughout so if you are in a hurry these come in handy.  . . Very clean with plenty of food and drink options, especially in the central area.  This airport does very well in making on time flights...I really can't remember the last time I was delayed here and I travel quite often.
Really need shorter waiting lines- it got worse. . The valet is annoying and gets in the way.
Terrible congestion.  Poor planning.  Poor traffic flow.  Poor crowd control.  This airport is 20 years behind other airports of similar size and volume.  Be forewarned.  You will have a 20-40 minute wait to get to passenger drop off or pick up, pretty much anytime between 6am and 9pm.  Parking?  Be prepared to park a long way away from the main building and wait up to an hour for a shuttle to pick you up. You could probably walk it by then, twice.  And by then, the shuttle may be pretty full.  If you're disabled, good luck.
We had a connecting flight to MIami and we had to stay here for 1.5 hours.. very clean airport and lots of restaurants to choose from too..
I travel really often, both domestically and internationally, and I must say this airport is one of the most excellent airports ive been to! The people who work here are so so pleasant and kind. And there a great variety of food options that are all close together.
Over the years I have hit a number of airports, Charlotte Douglas was a main stay for several years and is now a pass through for me as it is a US Airways hub. I love this airport. First - the array of rockers - Carolina Rockers of course - to sit and rock and people watch. The Grand Piano in the main area always seems to have someone tickling the ivories and it is wonderful. There are plenty of plugs around the airport to top off you cell phone or computer. There is free wireless. There are a number of food choices and some very friendly people serving. What more could you ask for? Well how about art. The mobile of all the planes from the history of aviation are in the main lobby, and more art can be found around if you are looking! Enjoy this one, It is a good one!
Us airways is incompetent and unfit to call themselves an airline!  True story emergency landing and stuck in the airport for 4 hours with no answers!!! No one seems to know what's going on?
Nope not any better this time around. Still hectic, still tons of people. If you have a connecting flight out of CLT - put your running shoes on - because it's a long way from gate to gate and usually you'll have to rush to make your next flight.
I had the pleasure of a 3 hour layover in Charlotte Douglas airport this past weekend on my way home from Vegas. It's a pretty large airport and the maps come in handy trying to navigate. . . It feels very open and spacious and you get tons of natural light. There are rocking chairs throughout which was a nice change of pace from your standard uncomfortable metal chairs.. . There are also a ton of food options. My friend and I perused the map and decided on the Wolfgang Pucks Express on the single premise that neither of us had any idea what it was and never tried it. But to our disappointment it was nowhere to be found! Eh it happens. Settled on an Uno express and it was tasty enough. . . The airport and the bathrooms were pretty clean especially for the amount of people that were roaming about. They had plenty of conveniently located bathrooms and there were attendants in every bathroom I went into making sure everything was tidy. . . They had a lot of shopping options to keep you busy as well and a spa/massage which is genius because I'm sure many people are achy after their flights! This was a pleasant change of pace and scenery from Newark airport which I'm used to.
People honestly review airports? As if you have options? As if you honestly decide whether or not to visit a city because of it's airport? The fact this this has 800+ reviews blew my mind!
I had a fantastic 3 hour layover here. The bathrooms are clean, not filthy. The seating areas would be better with more outlets. The staff was kind. I just wish instead of having to trek half a mile to get from one concourse to another that they'd add the train like in Atlanta because on my way back through I had maybe 10 minutes before my flight boarded and I had to go from B to E!
Nice airport. Security is normal. Easy to find your gate
Quickest airport I've been through! The precheck facility allows you to roll through with a jacket and shoes! Also no headache with taking your laptop out!
Not bad for an airport layover. A fair amount of decent food options in the middle of the terminal and a few rocking chairs and ample seating for passengers as they await to board. Too bad US Airways merged with American - I don't think the frequency of flights out of CLT is going to last.
If you can avoid checking your bags when flying into this airport - DO SO.  Worst baggage claim area I've ever experienced.  Over 45-minutes to get luggage.
This airport, as a whole, is fine. The US Airways section is awwwful. I've flown through here twice in the last year. The first time I had to walk clear across the airport for my connecting flight (but I did get Bojangles... sooo... that's good!). The last time I flew through here (on my unintentional airport tour of the Southern US) was awful. So many cancelled flights, lines forever, people everywhere... it was a zoo. I was there for so many hours over 2 days... makes me never want to go back. I do appreciate the rocking chairs and the Bojangles, but the rest was fairly awful.
Clean, well-lit, easy to follow foot traffic patterns and courteous staff.
Great food! Really they do! They don't have a lot of shops, but they do have variety of food! . . I had to connect from domestic to international and it was easy to get to, which was not bad.. . The people were nice and the airport felt clean. . . I was flying US Airways and taking it to Brazil, overall the experience was not bad, but I dislike long flights and red eyes.
Terrible service! The staff was nothelpful what so ever.. Very rude! I will never fly from here again! The airport is easy to get around but after my terrible experience I won't return
Clean airport with very friendly staff. Lots of different food and shopping spots for a smaller airport.
Very nice airport a lot of selections of food we stopped at Sbarro's to grab something to eat.
I mean, it's an international hotel. I've only ever used it for connecting flights, so I can't speak to parking or location.  but the terminals are wide enough, good position and location of flight monitors, and signs are clearly labeled to help you on your way.. . Shops and restaurants are scattered throughout the terminals, so that's a big plus.
I don't really fly that much and have only been to a handful of airports. Being that I live near Charlotte, I suppose I am biased towards CLT. There have been a few mishaps here. On one occasion, my flight to Chicago was delayed 4 times then cancelled. But, I suppose to the seasoned flyer that is normal. I also recently flew to BWI from here and have no complaints. The options for food are good here as well, especially Salsarita's.If I had a layover here, even though this is my home airport, I would be happy.
I guess if you fly USAirways, maybe this airport is good. Maybe it should be named USAirways Charlotte international.   If you fly out of concourse A, good luck.
Nice and simple but efficient layout. Tons of food and drink options. The only downer are the hopelessly outdated furniture and floor carpeting in the waiting areas..
CLT used to be better, but their passenger volume has increased significantly. I used to fly out of here as my main airport from 2005-2010, but have since moved away and just returned back. . . It is moderately-sized and laid out well, with well-placed maps throughout the terminal. There is also a decent selection of restaurants.. . The downside that I found on my recent trip is that volume is up heavily and there is not enough room to accommodate the additional passengers. The hallways were packed and there were no empty seats to be found.. . Even the U.S. Airways lounge was crowded.
One word to describe this place- awful. Sure not as bad as Philly, but Charlotte at least gets second place! Trying to get acrossthis airport is like a huge race! I've never seen so many people running around like madmen to get on connecting flights. When I was in the same situation, I ran like crazy with my wife and child to get from gate to gate. Finally when we got there, the woman who's name was I believe faseeka? Phasequa? Ghetto girl? Told us she had held the flight as long as possible; which was only about 5 minutes. The plane is still sitting near the gate clearly visible from the window. We pleaded with faseequa to let us on, but she literally too us the flight was closed and turned around so she wouldn't have to look at us. When we came back about 10/15 minutes later, the plane was STILL THERE! She then continued to type nonsense on her computer while I tried to talk to her. I asked her name, and then how I should spell it. She then refused to spell her name and got really snippy and utterly ignored me. In the end we missed a flight that was right there, sitting with the DOOR OPEN for 15 minute because faseequa refused to let us on. Screw this airport! We then had to wait 5 hours for another flight to an airport 2 hours from our house. Thanks you cold heartless woman. I understand your job is veeeerryyyy stressful, sorry to trouble you like that faseequa! (Sarcasm)
Not a bad airport.  Layout was okay - wide enough walkways, shops and food peppered around, sufficient number of bathrooms.. . It was packed because of some bad weather, so there was a bit of a shortage of seats at the gates.  It didn't seem to have any adverse effect on the supply of food, cleanliness, or staff demeanor so good for them!. . One thing I did not appreciate though - the bathrooms had attendants.  I don't love this anywhere, but I can accept it in a first class restaurant.  Not in an airport.  Especially when they seemed to be more interested in arranging their display of mints and showcasing their little cups of mouthwash than actually cleaning the bathrooms.
Nice airport with a good selection of shops and food.  It's a growing airport which is pretty large and has a large amount of passengers moving about.  Be sure to map your gates out in advance to make your travels smoother.
I'm obviously biased since I fly out of this airport monthly - but this is one of my favorite airports in America. It is large and spacious without being overwhelming. There is great food and shopping available. I often get there earlier than I need to in order to grab a quick fro-yo from Pinkberry or some fresh sushi before my flight. If you are a US Airways Club member, their club is AAAAWESOMEEE!! It is huge!! There are a ton of snacks available along with coffee, tea, and alcohol. . There is a lot construction going on around the parking areas so I will say that parking at this airport (despite being extremely cheap) can be a huuuuge pain in the butt. The shuttle service is sub-par and is usually packed to the brim with people and their luggage. If you are planning on parking at the airport, leave plenty of time to actually get to the airport because the shuttle service is quite inefficient.. But for those making connections through CLT, enjoy your short stay :)
Seeing as I am here now for a layover to go back home. I'd like to say.... Some of these people are rude as crap.. . . This is my first time at this particular airport and the layout is different from the ones I've been to.. Never heard of "concourses" and my boarding pass didn't have a gate number. So naturally, I go up to a person working and ask what I'm supposed to do. She looks at me in a "are you retarded" kind of look. Fine, whatever, they're somewhat busy they probably don't want to deal with a first timer. So I ask her where I'm supposed to go. She looks at me again like I'm retarded. I'm starting to get the hint that this woman is being downright rude. As I was trying to tell her and show her my boarding pass doesn't have a gate letter she interrupts and says in a rude, degrading voice, "concourse A." Whatever, I was glad to be done with her if she was gonna be rude to someone new to the freakin' place.. . I get to the security area, the TSA people checking my boarding passes are very friendly striking up conversations. "Finally.. People who are nice" get up to bag scan (keep in mind this was my 3rd airport I've been to and I haven't added anything into my bag except my laptop, phone, DS) been through 2 different airports both of which didn't confiscate my bag. They search my bag saying I had some sort of liquid. She searches and finds my super expensive face wash.. Says that I have to surrender it. Been through TWO other airports. Each have been through the same type of bag scanner and none took my facewash... . . Next time I have a flight and there is a layover to this airport, I'm booking a different flight whether it's way more expensive in price.
Its an airport....... they are constantly building and adding on to this airport. It is definitely growing and getting huge.
CLT is very easy to navigate through and with Pre-check at this airport getting to your gate is easy.. . Love the large food court as soon as you go through the checkpoint.
