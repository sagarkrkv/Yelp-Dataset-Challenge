After hearing amazing reviews during my 5 years living in Arizona, I finally decided to make the 30 minute drive to check out the hype.  I checked the website for menu and hours before making the trip. Someone had suggested to order ahead as the wait can be long, even on a weeknight, so while driving, I called ahead. No one answered but the voice message gave hours which suggested they may just be too busy to answer. Upon arrival, they were closed.  At 6 pm on a Tuesday evening. Their website and voice mail clearly stated 4 pm to 10 pm Tuesday-Saturday. There was another couple standing outside as well, in similar disbelief.  What a waste of a drive.  Luckily Federal Pizza was just a few miles up the road and they were not only open, but the staff was great and the pizza was outstanding. Very poor job of maintaining public communication.  Fail. I won't bother trying again.
The salad and pizza were very good, but NOT worth a 3 hour wait. Really. Heard good things, tried it once, won't be back.
This pizza was amazing. The crust was thin and crunchy in all the right places. Truly, the crust makes the pizza. Simply delicious. However, waiting outside for two hours in order to get a table? Not my favorite. If you have a willing friend who is naturally the martyr type- then definitely take the opportunity to eat here. Otherwise, check out Cibo- a small house-turned-restaurant nearby with pizza that is almost as good.
Cute restaurant. Very pleasant staff with quick service, though we were there early on a Tuesday night. For free Fresh bread with olive oil. . . The white pizza we ordered (can't recall the name) was ready in less than 10 minutes. It was good, but not the best pizza I've had by any stretch of the imagination. $18 for the equivalent of a small pizza with apprx a tablespoon of cheese and three onions is absurd. We were hungry an hour later. Glad I ate here for the novelty, but will never be back.
I know this is supposed to be the best pizza ever but I just don't feel the same.  The crust is amazing but their topping selection is not.  They have strange pairings and I am a pepperoni type of guy.
The pizza is decent.
Overall really impressed with the pizza. The food was consistent, not greasy, and clean. The prices are what you would expect. I do not make it downtown to often but would never turn down an opportunity to go to Bianco. I found the best setting is going with a group of friends. Enjoy a good bottle of vino and laugh with friends in a great atmosphere. Nothing negative to say about my experience or the food. Go and enjoy a delightful evening!. . Best advice about this style of pizza: . . -If you are a Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, or Dominos type of pizza lover you may not enjoy the pizza in the same manner. . . - If you are someone who enjoys a more traditional italian roots style pizza you will not be disappointed. Bianco did a great job creating a delicious signature style pizza. Two thumbs up!!!
Update:. . I have been here so many times, and I rarely have a wait.  I hear from people that have never been here before that they don't want to wait 4 hours for a table.  . . I just went this last Friday at 6pm and there was NO WAIT!  . . I honestly can't think of a time I waited more than 10 minutes for a table!  Some times I'm actually sad that there is no wait because I do want to go over to Bar Bianco and hang out for a bit before going to dinner!  :-)
How disappointing. . . We had heard a lot of good things about this place and decided to give it a try on a Friday afternoon. We went there pretty early and were lucky enough not to have to wait for a table. The service was pleasant enough but we were starving so we were primarily focused on the food. Our pizzas came out fairly fast. We ordered the Wiseguy and the Rosa (with extra mushrooms for the latter). The first few bites were good (we now think it was because we were so hungry) but over the next couple of minutes the pizzas became less and less pleasurable to eat. The crust was thin (no issue there, we both appreciate a good thin-crust pizza) and very very hard. So hard, in fact, that it hurt the roofs of our mouths and we could feel it for a couple of days afterwards. I had to keep washing it down with water to soften each bite. While I enjoyed the flavors of the Rosa, I probably had about a tablespoon's worth of sauce and toppings on mine, and it dried out within minutes. My husband had a similar complaint about the Wiseguy, and upon tasting it, I thought it also could have used a little more flavor. We both felt the crust tasted like a dried-out ciabatta. The only reason we finished the hard crusts was that we were still hungry.. Overall, we definitely won't be going back there. Grossly overpriced for what it is. I can't even imagine how upset we would have been if we'd had to wait for a table given the quality of the meal. And the pizza certainly didn't rank anywhere near our top 20.
Was headed to another establishment and noted there was not wait!! hooray! so change of plans - and very pleased with the decision. Great place to grab a bite of unique offerings, wonderful salads and really good service. will be back again.
My wife and I ventured out to downtown Phoenix to Pizzeria Bianco. Small place but well worth the wait. It's a little pricey but the pizza is of the chain if you like thin crust.. . This place definitely gets a "yeeesssss mister."
What a cool little place! REAL Italian food and atmosphere. We got the Margerita Pizza, which was delicious. You really can't beat good dough cooked in a brick oven. The basil is grown in a little planter box right out front. We also indulged one the flour-less chocolate cake, and if you've never had it, OH MY GOD. It's cake that's the consistency of fudge....Also, I have read other reviewers complain about the wait, but it's a tiny quaint place, nestled in a historic village setting. What is the problem? Our hostess quoted us 20 minutes and directed us to the beer and wine bar next door which was also very cool and it was happy hour so no complaints there. The wait was only ten and we could take our drinks with us. Great food, super freindly and interesting staff. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Italian food but thinks places like Carraba's  don't quite cut it.
Really???     "369 reviews for Pizzeria Bianco that are not currently recommended" of which one was from my wife and I.   How does 25% of all the reviews not get factored into the overall rating? New one opening in Tucson and I wont go there either.  Dumbfounded and wont rely on Yelp any longer.
Delicious. The freshest pizza I have ever tasted. You can tell they grow their own ingredients. I don't think I'll ever be satisfied eating pizza anywhere else. Oh, and you can't beat flourless chocolate cake! The cream with it made it perfection. So impressed.
A true Gem in Downtown Phoenix! We LOVE to enjoy the wait time at their adjacent bar house. Their Pizza is worth the wait & we love sitting at the bar!
best pizza in Phoenix! worth the usual 2 hour wait, there's a great bar across the street:)
we went family style and ordered 4 different pizzas and shared them all.  They were all good.  I was fortunate that we were done with patients early so when i got there, there was hardly any wait.  Everyone enjoyed them, but from my other experiences I know you can wait up to 3 hours to get in.  Its got a great decor but is small, and this often means you end up waiting a while.  I do not think it is worth anything more than a half hour wait but it is good.  All the pizzas are good!
