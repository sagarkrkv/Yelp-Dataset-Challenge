Amazing! It is by far my favourite casino, I almost don't mind losing money here. The whole place is just beautiful, not a detail was forgotten when they put this place together. The dealers are the friendliest in Vegas and the drinks are always excellent.. I play Poker Pai Gow there and have had the same dealers and pit bosses for the last few years.. I have never stayed at The Wynn just its sister casino The Encore, which is equally lovely.
This weekend my family and I stayed at the Wynn Resort and it was without a doubt the most wonderful experience we have ever had at a hotel establishment. From the moment that we arrived we were made to feel welcome. There seemed to be a genuine feeling of appreciation for my family and I booking our room here. The entire staff went out of their way to be accommodating and helpful. To me, it was the little things that really stood out. From the quick valet car retrieval, to the personal greeting by name when I called down to the front desk, to the meticulous labeling of my laptop bag with a "fragile" tag for safe handling. Our whole weekend was perfection from start to finish. We will without a doubt return with great haste as soon as humanly possible. P.S. and the view of the golf course .......... BREATHTAKING
My wife and I recently stayed at Wynn to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was a two night stay that we had looked forward to for months.  We booked the room directly with the hotel and told them we were celebrating our 18th wedding anniversary.  In the past, at other Las Vegas hotels, we have enjoyed upgrades or some little nice acknowledgement of the happy occasion.  One time we received a little hand written note from the GM wishing us the best.  I can't imagine that cost anything but we appreciated it. Wynn did nothing. I've never seen it before but about a month after I booked the room I received an email pushing upgrades for my stay.  I thought it was interesting they were still trying to upsell after I had said no over the phone.. . I don't care much for the decor of Wynn.  I'm not into red and it is definitely more contemporary than the classic looks I'm normally drawn to in other 5 star properties. At check in we had a distracted un-interested & emotionless front desk clerk.  Its was a surprisingly bad first impression.  I don't understand this given that we are in a great mood due to the occasion.  You'd think it would be easy to interact with a happy guest.  I mentioned once again we were celebrating our anniversary and asked if she would give us a free upgrade. She said sorry she could not do that and proceeded to take out a folder with paid upgrades starting at $25/night.  She does this in front of my wife and embarrasses me to no end.  I'm thinking to myself... What I'm not paying enough right now for the hotel room, taxes and resort fees? $25 is cheap but I know I will be dropping a couple $1000 over the next two nights on food drinks and gambling.  Why do you want to ruin our good mood over $25?. . On the upside our room was great: clean spacious and well appointed.  Nothing better or worse than the other great properties in Vegas.  The staff we encountered around the hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful.  We ate in the hotel several times including a memorable visit to Mizumi.  The Buffet was very disappointing but everything else was quite good, even the over priced drinks at the pool.  Check out was just as disappointing as check-in with an equally non emotional monotone speaking front desk clerk.  . . I wrote a letter to Wynn expressing our concerns with our stay. We received a half hearted response so they must not see a problem in all this.
So glad to be pulling up to my favorite hotel and casino. I know everything will be just right. I'm always treated right customers are always first at the Wynn properties, the rooms are awesome, perfect for extra guest to sleep over, ok enough we are getting ready to check out some strip clubs.
I was here for a convention last week and it is an amazing hotel. You see how beautiful it is from the moment you walk in. Both the exterior and interior are very classy. The staff are very friendly and courteous. I didn't gamble much because I was at the convention but I walked through the casino to get to the convention center, rooms, and restaurants and it is very nice. The room we stayed in was on the 29th floor and had a breathtaking view of the strip and all the way west of Las Vegas to Summerlin and the Red Rock mountains. Everything in the room was unbelievable, the bed, the shower, etc. I had forgotten my razor blade and housekeeping brought it up right away. And the bellmen are timely and courteous. We couldn't fall asleep one night because our neighbors were noisy past midnight (on a Thursday night, but it is Vegas after all). They were kind enough to change our room for the rest of the stay. I'm not sure what the regular price was but I paid $ 150 - $ 200 per night. This was the convention rate and I am sure the regular rate is much higher, especially on holidays such as New Year. Definitely worth a visit.
"Pure Luxury At It's Finest!". Steve Wynn outdid himself when he built this and the Encore Hotel! The ambiance of this who entire place just screams luxurious and has such great customer service that it's hard to beat! I only stayed one night in one of the tower king room's but if you can catch a good price even if it's just for one night I recommend that you stay here! The buffet is out of this world! Go prepared to be stuffed!!
We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff was extremely attentive, the room felt luxurious enough to warrant the price (we were in the Tower, an upgrade we made at checkin for a very sweet deal). I loved the bathrobes and flirted with the idea of buying one until I saw the tag in the hotel store (200 dollars, alas).. . The more secluded pool you get when you upgrade was very nice and not crowded, with prompt service by the extremely helpful eyecandy, I mean staff.. . Our room deal included tickets to Le Reve, which was incredible. If you have a chance to see it I highly recommend you do. Much better than O in my opinion, but in a similar vein, combining dance and gymnastics and diving, with artistry in the visual effects that is mind blowing.. . We also ate at their breakfast buffet, at 10:45 which it turns out is a good time to go- you can eat both the breakfast and lunch menus as they transition over. The bottomless margaritas were a good deal, since we definitely got into the spirit of the "bottomless" part.  I was very impressed at the variety of dishes, and how good they were considering it was a buffet. I'm trying to remember what we had, but the names of specific dishes seem to have been drowned in the sea of OJ and bubbly.. . The casino did NOT smell like cigarette smoke, which is always a plus for me. We only saw it as we passed through, as we weren't there to gamble.. . Save up your $$$ and give it a try.
3 stars for the pool. Why is it so warm? I understand that it was 105 degrees throughout the day but isn't there something that can be done to cool the water so it doesn't feel like a bath tub? Secondly, put some caution signs to warn your guests about the grounds being slippery when wet. I slipped on the steps walking over he bridge in the pool area. I never once saw a sign posted anywhere and saw multiple and large puddles of water. When I called to make a complaint, the security guard said that he agreed they should put more signs to heed caution and that the wynn does put ONE sign in an unnoticeable area. I recommended they put a caution sign for those like myself who may be a little clumsy and need forewarning. . . 5 stars for the gym. The cleanest, nicest, accommodating gym I have ever been too. . . Overall, really enjoyed the hotel. The hotel staff was very nice and always wished you a good day and a smile.
I should have written this review awhile ago because I stay here or at the encore several times a year. It is honestly my favorite hotel and I've stayed at several in Vegas.  It's right at the beginning of the strip and when I stay I rarely leave this resort because it has so much...shopping, amazing dining and a cirque show, as well as three night clubs.  It's also super clean and never smells like smoke and their staff is so helpful and professional. Beautiful large suites and bathrooms. I'm a sucker for a great bathroom.  Every area from the pool to the gym is perfectly maintained.  If I stay at another hotel, I always find myself wishing I were at this one.
Beautiful hotel in the las vegas strip beautiful design the service is good the people are very nice and the casino is amazing!!
The reason for this one star review is because there is NO possibility of sleep at this hotel on the weekends and they simply don't care. It is 3:23AM as I write this with front desk informing me it will last till 4:00 AM. . Like many who come here for conventions - this is deeply disturbing when one must get up early for work -and to pay high Vegas rates for a top property.
This hotel is beautiful and spacious.  There is no denying.  Unlike other hotels though.  It's located at the end of the Strip and when I went, I didn't get any comps which I was annoyed with.  I usually get complimentary services and such on all the other hotels.  When I decide to splurge on this hotel, I didn't get crap?  Ridiculous.  Management might want to show some appreciation to their guest when the guest is spending so much money here.. . The pool is to die for. Gorgeous trees surrounding their blue pools. I was seriously surprised their pool wasn't deep at all. At most it was 4 feet. . . We got the Wynn Deluxe Panoramic room. The room was magnificent.  Love the white and gold colored schemed decor as well as how cleaned it looked.  The window and view was spectacular, well worth spending to spoil for someone. Room was very well lit and everything was controlled by the cool remote stand near the bed.. . Maybe I would come back here but maybe for a special occasion.
This is one of the nicer hotel rooms I have stayed in. It had a beautiful view of the golf course and the pool from the 54th floor through a floor to ceiling panoramic window. Seriously, the whole exterior wall was made of glass, so beautiful. The decor was simple and colored white/light brown but there were splashes of color from various paintings hanging on the wall. The bed was super comfortable. . . We stayed for two nights and had a great time. We were comped two tickets to the show - Le Reve, The Dream. It was a great show. We were also comped a meal for two at the buffet. Upon checkout, I was informed that I received a single night stay comped with no strings attached for later in the year. Basically, the staff at The Wynn was very professional and super friendly with great attention to detail.. . IMHO, the only shortcomings are the location at the north end of the strip. Makes for a good walk if you want to get anywhere else. Also, the guests at the hotel seemed to me to be older, on average. It was so quiet on our floor,which was awesome, but I literally never saw anybody in the hallway after 11pm.  I was mindful of the fact that my coming and goings in the wee hours of the night, might have been an annoyance to some. Oh well, I didn't go to Vegas to be in bed early. LOL. The night clubs at the Wynn and Encore bring in younger people from other hotels but the overall feel is that it caters less to the party crowd than say, Caesar's for example.. . The Wynn is a beautiful hotel and I would love to stay there again.
