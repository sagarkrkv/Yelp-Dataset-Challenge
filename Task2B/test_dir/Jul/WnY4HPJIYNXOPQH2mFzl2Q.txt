My friends and I stayed at THEhotel for EDC and booked 2 rooms with 2 queen size beds each 6 months ahead of time through Hotwire. We arrived on the Friday of EDC to check in only to find out that the hotel was overbooked and they would only be able to give us 2 rooms with 1 king size bed each. What was the point in booking so far ahead of time? And wouldn't a busy weekend like EDC prompt better handling of reservations by THEhotel?. . What added insult to injury was the nonchalant attitude of the concierge when trying to resolve the issue. She responded to our dissatisfaction unsympathetically with: "Well, it's EDC weekend and we're busy." And she didn't even offer any consolation until I asked for it. The consolation (which again, I had to ask for myself) included free roll-out beds upon request (which they tried to charge us for when we requested them) and a measly $50 food & drink voucher (which basically buys one meal for two people due to the inflated prices).. . Even after EDC weekend, my friend reported that he was charged a room cleaning fee for his room, because THEhotel claimed that the room was trashed (which it wasn't). They waived the fee only after he called to dispute it.. . I don't plan on staying at THEhotel again whether or not it's a busy weekend like EDC. It was the only horrible experience to what otherwise was an enjoyable weekend.
Stayed here for the second time this weekend, and the hotel is a disaster. Service at Guest services is dreadful, from your room, it takes more than 6 minutes for anyone at the front desk to answer a phone.  most of the building is under construction, switching from TheHotel to Delano and all of the grounds are limited since construction is underway. The floors where rooms are located smell like heavy cigarettes, and the overall staff (with the exception of housekeeping which was phenomenally helpful) was unhelpful. Amenities in this building were not available, and we had to use those in Mandalay Bay which although connected, was very far away.
Note that during this stay we were shuffled to four different rooms, each one was a pathetic story in its own right.  Delano charged us for room damage that was not done and the front desk took the fake charge off. Sounds good?  Nope!  Charge reappears on the credit card statement.  A call to Delano when we get home and they say it was a mistake and charges will be removed, they even sent an email stating that with a confirmation number. Phew, problem resolved!  Oh, my mistake the charge remains there until I file a dispute and now (3 weeks post visit) it has been removed and I can put this horror hotel behind me. . . With the change over from THE Hotel to the Delaney be prepared for longer waits, poor service, major construction changes and much higher prices.  The latest scam is to make you wait for a room because nothing is available unless you want to spend $100 extra a night for a new room.  I am currently in a crowded lobby with many other unhappy souls waiting for their room too.  Check in began a long time ago.  This is pathetic
Used to be our favorite place to stay in Vegas...  THE Hotel is now Delano.  It's currently undergoing construction and during fight week no less.  We were not informed that we would hear pneumatic drills and jackhammers not only in our room, but in the hallways it's SO loud people are walking covering their ears!  We were put in one of the updated rooms that will be Delano, we hated it.  We come to Vegas to relax and loved the dark, romantic setting that THE Hotel had offered, now it's white on white Miami style...not very relaxing.  We were also promised a pool view, we got no pool view but a rooftop and a parking lot.  We asked to be movedto THE Hotel...not Delano..which they did and we got a strip view which was better.  THE Hotel does definitely need to be updated, just not to the contemporary modern Miami white.  We will be staying somewhere else next time.  I hear the jackhammer in my room as I'm writing this. Hotels should be required to disclose that they are under construction, or will be at the time of your stay!
The room here was very nice. We got upgraded, so I'm not sure how nice a basic room is. However, the reason I'm rating it 3 stars is because of noise level, the guest service, and the location. . . While staying here, there was construction going on that was so loud, you couldn't even be in the lobby. You could even here the noise in the hotel room. At night, when the construction would stop, the club they just opened up would start and the music is so loud, you can hear which song they are playing. It makes it very difficult to sleep before 1am. . . When I would go down to the lobby or to get out of the casino, the hotel workers were extremely rude. I would walk up with a smile and say,"Hello, excuse me but I have a quick question..." They would blankly stare and not say anything. So I would continue with my question after asking if they even worked there... They would answer with a word or two and that's it. There was another time when a lady didn't even look my way while I asked her the best way to get to the coffee bar. She just pointed and continued her conversation with the other worker there. After that, I just stopped asking them for anything. . . And lastly, the location is pretty far from walking any place. So, if you don't mind paying for a taxi, I suppose this wouldn't be a problems or you. But, I feel the location topped off with everything else just made it all a bad experience.
The room was very nice. Right now there is construction and even on the 13th floor it woke us up way too early for vacation. The service was good and the people were very pleasant. The construction was so loud though. There is not free coffee in your room, but there is a K-cup they will charge you $4 for. Also, when we got to our room it smelled funny. I found the culprit- old leftovers under the counter from the previous guest. . . The lazy river was nice, but not lazy! There were tons of kids without tubes splashing around. There should be a rule that you must have a tube! We paid over $20 for ours, and went around the loop twice. I got sick of being kicked by kids trying to swim in the river and we left.  FYI: more kids at this hotel than the others I've been at on the strip. . . Eh-I wouldn't stay here again.
So my husband accidentally booked us here rather than the four seasons. I was  disappointed but it didn't seem so bad when we checked in. The room was nice, big,a suite, recently upgraded. But the acoustics are terrible. When I went to sleep (admittedly early) there was pounding base from one of our neighbors and then at 5:30am was awoken to them having loud sex. Great way to wake up!. . Housekeeping was terrible.  They never came to clean the room on the first day and the light to clean was on.  I called for more towels and shampoo that evening and it was never delivered, and then the next day when the baby (who we had to pay $35 for a crib for) were taking a nap housecleaning came by and rang the door bell 5 times before trying to break down the door (with the do not disturb light) before I could get there.  The room had already been cleaned!  I am beyond frustrated with the housekeeping here.. . Next time we will definitely be staying at the four seasons!
So I thought this hotel would be nice since its a part of Mandalay and its a suite. But its aiiight! it aint that great. They were doing remodeling in the lobby so it was annoying kuz it was loud. There was a certain smell when you walk down the hall to ur room. Not sure what smell that was but it was jus different. My nose did not enjoy it much! right when u walk into the room, to the right side is a half bathroom, then its the living room area, which is a nice size, then to the right is the bedroom and bathroom. The room was clean. the TV in the room sucked. it was like them ol skool TV's where it was huge in the back part. I liked the bathroom, it was nice and clean and big. there was a small TV in the bathroom which was cute. the bed was VERY comfy but the pillow sucked. It was too thick and it made my neck hurt. Overall it was aiiight and cool. I think i would rather stay in a regular room at mandalay bay than the suites area. But i would pick Vdara over The Hotel.
I used to love staying at this place.  My mistake in booking I was not aware of the construction, but I was given a renovated room.  It was so new the couch was too stiff to sit on comfortably and the pillows were like sleeping on a curb they were a foot thick and hard. I slept on my arm for comfort.  At 5 AM I was awoke by construction hammering in the room above me, however when I called down it stopped 5 minutes later.  The staff was rude as well.  Not sure I'll come back to this place ever again or recommend it.
THEsuite is THE BOMB! So I have alway wanted to stay at Mandalay Bay when traveling to Vegas and this time I was able to land a nice deal at THEhotel through my mlife membership! Only stayed one night but the check in process was a breeze. I was greeted accordingly and helped promptly! That's always a plus! I was put on the 28th floor with a nice South facing view! From the moment you step foot into THEhotel it already feels like paradise! The ambiance of this place is amazing. Talk about feeling luxury! I booked THEsuite and it did more than satisfy what i look for in luxury hotels. Marble countertops, Marble floors, the living room area very spacious with a big flat screen tv. Bedroom is huge as well as the bathroom. All around wonderful stay!
well. this was the 24 hours to stay in this hotel. . at first i get room floor 14 it was smelly and noisy.. Than they transfer me to floor 3, but it still smelly and noisy.. Than they transfer me to 20 floor that was only noisy. . Than i left this poor place to other hotel. And i feel great!!!
Great big hotel room with a sitting area and 1.5 bathrooms. The tub was huge, the two queen beds were more like two twins but they were comfortable. Three TVs and the one on the bathroom even had a waterproof remote. Elevators were fast and plentiful. . . The pool area was the best. We thought about renting a cabana but we didn't see a huge advantage and felt good saving $300. Food and drinks were expensive. There was no alternative. The deck was hot, bring flip flops and we thought the beach area with sand was too hot. We found some partially shaded chairs by the river pool and loved them. The wave pool was really great but waves were generated only every minute. We wanted more. The river pool was awesome. You can rent a tube or bring your own but we had the best time when we didn't use anything and just swam the river.. . The lifeguards were not very attentive. We saw them texting, talking, flirting, etc. it's pretty safe water but we wouldn't feel comfortable letting our 9 and 11 year old on their own. The pool was very very family friendly otherwise.
Our trip was earlier this month, after reading the reviews I was very apprehensive, almost switched to another hotel.  But we decided to see for ourselves.  The lobby was under construction, but we actually found it amusing to see the different labrynth of walkways every time we went through.  Also enjoyed seeing the transformation.  Construction noise in lobby very loud.  Construction noise in suite not a trace until our last day.  Even with the new building letters being hoisted past our window.. . We checked in on a very busy day, had a slight issue with requested room, but front desk (after a few tries) ended up getting everything right. Our suite was perfect and it was an old V suite not yet remodeled, there were no issues with housekeeping, plumbing, or anything else in the suite.  . . Will miss staying here   will have to quit smoking so that we can stay again.   Transformation to Delano looks wonderful, very upscale  and again front desk was super accommodation, there was just one glitch that they worked out to our satisfaction.
Ein schones Hotel zum Relaxen in der Poollandschaft oder zum Schlemmen in den zahlreichen Restaurants. Die Zimmer sind super, geraumig und sauber. Die Minibar lasst keinen Wunsch offen. Das Personal ist hoflich und hilfsbereit.
