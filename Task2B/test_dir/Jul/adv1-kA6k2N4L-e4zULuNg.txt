During our recent visit to Las Vegas, we stayed at the Golden Nugget so we were able to relive the Fremont Street Experience every day and night. Under the light canopy, there's a lot of fun things to see and do. You can "fly" above the crowd of tourists with the SlotZilla Zip Line, watch and take pictures with street performers, listen to live music, people watch, shop at specialty kiosks, and of course, gamble and get free or cheap drinks at the casinos. At night, there's also the infamous hourly light show. Definitely a great place to visit in Vegas.
I thought the strip was strange, but this place was overwhelming. There are some good highlights like the zipline and the stage performances and the ceiling vision show, but that's pretty much it. There are so much going on at the same time and it's too much to processed and we saw too many boobs and butt cheeks within the hour we were here. There were too much smoke from the casinos and I was literally gasping for clean air. Since I experienced the majority of this place, I'm done. Never again. The strip was so much more fun and chill and "normal".
The zip line is a MUST do! The light show is outstanding. Women walking around with their boobs out and half naked girls dance on top of tables. Wants not to like at this place! lol Overall fun place to visit. Not so much for the little ones.
Fremont Street is my favorite part of Vegas.  We always stay at the Golden Nugget.  Love how everything is right outside the hotel!  Street performers, lights, drinks, music, and gambling!  :)  The most fun!!!
I love the downtown old school feel here.  Perfect to get away from the glitz and glamour of the strip.  It's laid back. Many free shows by people just trying to make a living... You'll see many peculiar people lol seem to have more luck gambling in downtown rather than  the strip for sure.  What sucks about downtown  is no real free parking.  They make validating a ticket complicated.
Great place to drink. People watch. And be thankful of your life. Get drinks at the ABC store (way cheaper than the bars) and walk around or enjoy the live entertainment around.
I at first thought they were crazy with the enforcement of the no open container law on the Experience but now after getting a better understanding it makes total sense. I agree that it will help clean up downtown. We like hanging out downtown on the Experience. It's one of the best places in the world to people watch. Everyone should always feel safe, especially in a tourist area and that feeling was starting to escape down there. They had to try something before it was too late.. Now if you would like to purchase a frosty brew or reasonably priced mixed drink there are a few spots you need to know about.... . California Casino bars- $2 Stella's, $3 Jose 1800 Silver. Fremont Casino bars - $1 house margarita or pina colada, $2 Heineken or Corona's, $3 Redbull Vodka. Mermaids - super fast, really nice drink servers
Our cousin from HK came so we decided to go to this place because we hear it was really different from the Vegas Strip as we have never been here before either. So we decided to check this place out. I thought it was a pretty cool and interesting experience because Fremont and the Strip are two totally different places. It's kinda nice that you get to see how it was like back then with the crazy lights flashing "CASINO" before a hotel. There are a lot of street work in this place and a lot of people wondering around with many pop up stores. . . You would see a lot of band, singers, and artists in the middle of the street just doing their thing and a lot of performers just performing magics and such. It's a really lively place. I think it's one of those places where you should experience once because it's different.
My hotel was located on Fremont Street, so I gave it a shot. It's just what you would expect: loud music, large crowds, and flashy light. It was impressive for the first ten minutes, but it got old and redundant really fast. I suppose it would have been more fun drunk, which is easier said than done because the alcohol was so expensive. This was relatively dissapointing in comparison to the Vegas strip experience.
"Heart Attack Grill!!". This is where the heart attack grill burger place is located along with all of teh other old style vegas hotels and very cheap gambaling! You have to try out the zip line while you are here as well! Always better to visit at night
We had a good time!
I went on a Saturday night and despite the fact that it was kinda busy I still enjoyed myself - something I feel is rare in Vegas. . . The free concert series was fun and I enjoyed how all the different bar tenders got into the music and had fun with it. The spray paint art was amazing, and the few street performers were fun to watch. I wish there had been more little food and drink vendors, rather than the vast amount of bars and the Walgreens at the very end. . . I know downtown is still in the process of being revitalized, which is why I did not give it the fifth star.
I'd give this a pass during the day. No doubt at night the covered walkway is impressive. But during the day it just seems run down.
Definitely not my average scenery when I visit Vegas. I'm so used to the "strip" with all the fancy bougie hotels. My trip, this time was so different and I'm so glad it was. We visited Fremont street after dinner to see what all the craziness was all about. It's like a huge live carnival-ish, circus-ish, rave-ish place. Loud music, wierdos, fun people and scary people. You will see all sorts of people. Besides the few creepers, everyone was pretty nice. We walked around for 30-45 minutes before we hit up the casinos. We enjoyed our time here. It's definitely a place to visit one time  you visit Vegas. After 20+ yrs, this was my first time.
Loved it and the light show. This was my first time and it won't be my last. Fun dancing , characters dressed up, street performers and the famous light show were fun!!!!! My kids are teens so they thoroughly enjoyed themselves! I highly recommend visiting this area especially if you've never been.
Took our son and daughter-in-law down last Wednesday night. They were visiting from Denveras they do every year. What is the deal with plastic cups to pour beer into?? We have always drank aluminum bottles and cans. You can have naked ladys and guys displaying their junk for kids to see but can't carry a aluminum can or bottle !!! Went to Container Park for food, no kids after 9 ?? Way to sell out DTLV....
I have been to the Fremont Street Experience twice and it's so-so. I think Freemont Street is something everyone should see at least once. It's one of those places that is really cool right when you get there and see the canopy light show, but after one walk down the street it loses a lot of excitement.  The crowd is definitely much more interesting than the strip, to say the least. So if you like people watching it is great for that and they do have outdoor concerts which is cool. It's definitely worth the trip to check it out for 30 minutes but other than that doesn't keep me interested very long.
