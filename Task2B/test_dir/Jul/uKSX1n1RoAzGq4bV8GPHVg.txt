St. Francis wins best french fries in all of Phoenix, hands down.  Their sister restaurant at the Downtown Public Market seems to have the recipe, but can't quite match up.  St. Francis remains a favorite brunch spot (great live music starts at 10:30am Sundays), and performs just as well for dinner.  The service is always on par and the food is consistently delicious.  Go for their breakfast sandwich, sans mayo-sauce (come on, quit being fancy - no matter what you call it, may doesn't belong on a breakfast sandwich).  Their flat bread pizzas and burgers are always a good call at dinner time.  Did I mention happy hour?  The bar scene here is small, but if you can grab one of the outdoor stools, you'll be happy for quite some time.
Went for Sunday brunch today. Seated within 10 minutes was nice. Gave us a table directly in front of the jazz band and I couldn't hear myself think, it was extremely loud. Moved us upstairs. I had the fried egg sandwich, which I ordered with a hard yolk and it came with a soft yolk (yuck). The server, Daniel, said he'd "do something for us." Hubby's crispy onion burger was greasy and underseasoned. Check came and Daniel did not do amything for us. So it's highly unlikely that we will return to this restaurant.
Had a great lunch. My son and I had the Pork Chili Verde with egg, up. It was as much pork gumbo as chili, and it was fantastic. Our server was great. Attentive with ought being annoying. You need to give it a go!
St. Francis is a truly great gathering spot.  I've come here a few times with friends and family and I always enjoy the atmosphere, the outside seating is nice even when it might seem to hot to go out.  They have a wonderful happy hour and who doesn't appreciate locally sourced ingredients.  They are always happy to accommodate and one night they let my girlfriends and I stay even after they had closed up shop and were about to finish cleaning the place.  That's what I call great customer service!. . The desserts at St. Francis are my favorite.  I've devoured the sticky toffee pudding and the Apple Crumb Tart,  you should enjoy them at some point too.  I feel that this picture of the Apple Crumb Tart speaks for itself, you would be a fool to skip dessert here.. . My favorite dish at St. Francis, other than dessert, is the Pig Dip.  The pork loin is cooked perfectly, I'm a sucker for prosciutto and bacon and the fennel marmalade, Dijon and Gruyere make my taste buds scream for joy.  I have to state for the record that I have not had brunch here yet and it always looks fantastic when I see people posting pictures.
Like many other folk when I travel I like to eat at places I've seen featured on tv shows.  This one was on D,D, and D.  We ordered a variety of things and most of it was very good. The fingerling potatoes,the flatbread, and the chili were all very tasty.  The signature pig dip sandwich however was disappointing, and most expensive at $16.  And I did not care for the Moroccan meatballs, but others at the table did.  All in all and good experience but, like most things, didn't quite live up to expectations.
Tried this place since I saw it was featured on Food Network's Diners drive in's and dives. It has a very clean/modern ambiance inside.  We went during happy hour to avoid the crowds I heard a lot about. Parking is valet only pretty much. They have offsite but it's a walk. . . At happy hour I got the morrocan meatball entree for $11 at happy hour instead of the regular price of $16. Same portion size too. It is tasty but very very filling. The cous cous on the bottom of the plate is nice but I kind of wished for more starch since the tomato sauce can get pretty tart without some starch to even it out. My wife got their infamous pork sandwich which was nice. Overall nice place and I would go back if I was in the area.
Love this place, free valet parking, great  menu choices, price are not outrages. Modern,vintage and a touch of rustic. Weekend at pack, but they make you feel connected while waiting. Great place for a very good weekend dinner.
This was our first time here for dinner and the reason we went is because they did not disappoint when we went there for lunch back in the spring. We liked the decor and ambience. Clientele and staff including the valet all seemed relaxed. The tomato soup was awesome and our other starter was the tomatoes/ mozzarella (aka. Caprese) and we enjoyed that as well. I had the scallops for dinner and I'm not a big scallop guy but they were awesome. My fiance said they looked big and juicy as well as delicious but she did not try a bite. Lol She had the salmon which she said was very good and I agreed cause I finished her plate. She said the quinoa was a little to sweet for her but I had no problem with it. Service was pretty good...non intrusive and didn't let our glasses get empty. We will be back.
Today my husband and I went to brunch at St Francis for the first time.  The food was fabulous, the service fantastic with Greg and Kaitlyn and of course the wonderful jazz music.  Can't wait to return!!!
Really good food. Nice happy hour. Kinda pricey but good quality food.. . The good: burgers, chile stew, rice dish, atmosphere. . The bad: Moroccan meatballs were gross and everyone agreed. The server was not the best, we had a fruity little guy named Andrew. Never filled our drinks once and was kind enough to include himself a 20% tip on our tab.
I think the poor service would have been slightly forgiven if they had not added gratuity after "serving" our brunch.  Where to start:. . Tucker, our waiter, has reached his peak in the service industry.  Don't accept a 6 top if you can't handle a 6  top.  I go to brunch with 5 other girlfriends and due to a sore throat I was unable to speak my order above a whisper.  When my friend orders for me, he says; "She can't talk, but can she at least speak English?"  In addition to avoiding large groups, perhaps he's best avoiding minorities, as I am a Latina and have no tolerance for the assumption that I can't speak English.. . Our mediocre server then suggests the eggs benedict, drops off our food and does not return to assess whether we needed anything else.  The eggs were not poached and after bringing the plate to a random waiter, I was then brought eggs that STILL were not poached on cold english muffins.  Tucker never returned to make sure my second order was made properly.  He was no where to be found when we needed water, coffee, and/or drinks refilled.  We would have stayed, as everyone else enjoyed their mimosas and breakfast.  However, how can we stay any longer when our waiter doesn't reassess if his table needs anything?. . . The live jazz was wonderful,  the hostess was kind.  Even the random waiter I brought my plate too was more than empathetic.  Hopefully you'll have a great experience and hopefully Tucker treats his future customers with a little more respect and a little less racism.
