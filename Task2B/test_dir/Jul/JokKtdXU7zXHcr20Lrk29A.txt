Good beer and pretty good food, but the service has never been great for me. . . I've had several instances where our table was ignored for long periods of time (it shouldn't take 20minutes to get a glass of water or the check). And we went to have dinner (at 6:30pm) with some friends. One friend forgot his ID, which was fine because he didn't want to drink, but they said we couldn't go in. Then the guy changed his mind and said we could sit outside,  but no one at the table could order a drink. Even though there were tons of family sitting with young kids and teenagers and the parents had a drink. You are a RESTAURANT and bar. If your waiter can't keep track of who ordered a drink and showed their ID and who didnt, then they shouldn't be a waiter.. . It's a decent place, but not worth most of the hassle. I'll just order their beer elsewhere.
The beer is tasty but happy hour is week 1 dollar off beers and no happy hour menu. I had the French dip and it was good but expensive. Service was good too, very attentive.
Can't say enough good things about Four Peaks. Out of the several locations they have in the valley, this is my favorite. . . I'vetried a few of the different burgers they have here and the enchiladas, nothing disappoints. There's a lot more to the menu than just burgers though so more options if a burger isn't your craving. The menu has recommendations for pairing their beers with certain meals too. The beers are always great here.. . It's almost guaranteed that the place will look packed no matter what time of day you come by, but it's huge on the inside and has tons of seating. Never actually had to wait for a table yet in all the visits I've had at this place.
Do not go in the summer. It is way too hot and no AC. Unacceptable for me. I love their peach ale. It is delicious. I will update this review when I go back in the winter.
Let me start with the fact that I am not a big beer drinker. But went here with a group of friends. I had no expectations, but really liked the place. I started with the wings, which are some of the best around. Great buffalo sauce and perfect crispness. The groups shared the nachos. They were HUGE! They were also pretty good, but way to much greasy cheese for my taste.. I had the southwest burger, protein style. It was really good and the side salad was better than expected. Good mix of local, and college people. All in all I have nothing bad to say, good food, good people watching, and good beer. I would definitely go back.
Good food, good beer, rotten a/c.. 8st ale was good I asked for a non-fruity tasting beer and Kyle recommended 8st and it was just right . I ordered a Italian beef sandwich on beer bread. The beer bread tasted more like a soft tortilla. table service was good and fast. We were a party of 6 and we were seated towards the back of  room where there was absolutely no air flow , a/c mind you this is July in Arizona it's was 108 outside inside was miserable and high humidity.  It ruined a perfectly good time for our out of state companions. For me  No Mas 4 peaks
I came here today with a large group, curious about their beer and how they'd handle a large group. Well, they certainly have lots of space with huge outdoor AC units. That's a plus. . . I ordered their popper burger and sampled 3 beers hoping to order a pint. Here are my general thoughts. . . The burger: great fries, enjoyed the onion strings. The jalapenos bit. The cream cheese was ok and had an unusual texture. The burger itself didn't stand out.. . The beer: I had asked for the Scottish and the Hop Knot. The waitress wasn't sure what the second one was, so she gave a third. That was also good, though all three seemed light weight on the tongue. However, the waitress returned midway through my burger and by then I didn't feel like a pint. Timing is everything.
Very good food, but don't bother going after 3pm if you are under 21. I attempted to eat at Four Peaks around 6pm with my boyfriend a few months ago and was told I could not come in to the restaurant after 3pm without a parent or guardian because I am only 20. It was pretty embarrassing, but the staff was nice enough about it. Wish they would have had some sort of notice on their website so I would have known ahead of time.
I read many reviews before going to this place and most are spot on. The beer is very good, the nachos with blackened chicken was awesome, and the AC was not on. Since we went at night it was not as big of a deal. . We had a petite, bleach blonde waitress who gave us probably overall the best service I have ever had. The place is worth trying but I don't think we will be back until summers over. The fact that they have fans and think that will be enough to cool the establishment is the reason I took off a star. GET SOME DAMN AC
Great service and great food!
I LOVE LOVE LOVE Four Peaks.  Any time I go to AZ, I HAVE to stop here.  It's that good.  The beer?  Fantastic.  I'm a girly beer drinker, so my favorites are the Peach Ale and the Sunbru. Both are great!  And the food....OMG.  The shrimp and goat cheese is AMAZING, but be prepared for major garlic breath.  My BF's garlic breath was so strong, it made my eyes water.  But it was worth it!  Hehe.  The Arizona Chicken Rolls were also suuuuper tasty.  So good that I was annoyed I missed getting them the other times we've been to Four Peaks before!  I haven't had a chance to try many of their entrees yet, the appetizers are too darn good!  Can't wait until the next AZ trip!
Cold beer, HUGE location, tons of selections, and their food is great.  I had the wings this time and they were huge and delicious.  Great place to watch any kind of sporting event.
I've never had a bad experience at Four Peaks. The service is great, servers are very personable and fun (go see Carly, she's great!) The beer is amazing.... You can never go wrong with the HopKnot! Food is delicious... Try the salmon BLT, it's life changing. . . This is by far my favorite place to eat/drink/watch sports/hang out in Arizona. It's hard to compare any other microbreweries to this one!! :)
This place is awesome. I've only been here a few times, but the service was great, and the food was delicious
So all in all this was a great experience! The food was good, service was friendly and the beer was tasty. . . For starters the service was great- good food recommendations and service was quick. Follow up could have been a little stronger but hey nobody's perfect. . . The food was good I got the carne assada pork and it really got the spot. Good flavor, although the meat could have been a littletender-I think it dried out a bit. The sides were very tasty. Only real complaint was the tortillas, they were too big to handle nicely-they used burrito sized tortillas. Good but a smaller tortilla would have been easier to handle. . . The beer was great! I ordered the sampler and enjoyed every minute of it. Kilt lifter was great as always but for me the stand out was rhaj. Only complaint was I wish they incorporated more of the seasonals in the sampler not just the standards!
Great Place. Visited constantly in college and it doesn't disappoint when I'm back in town. First stop when I get off the plane
I don't think it's a big secret how great Four Peaks is. You can find their beer almost anywhere in AZ and for good reason. . . Besides having great beer, their food is awesome as well. . . Great location and when the weather is nice, their patio can't be beat.
Fried quail sandwich was perfect. The Italian beef was a cheesesteak from heaven. Beer is also worth a try ! The peach ale and hefeweizen and kiltlifter and raj are all yummy
Four peaks is my favorite brewery in the area, especially in the Tempe location!  You'll be drinking and eating right inside the brewery next to the tanks.   Come in for the beer, but stay for the food.  The chef in this joint is on point, and everything I've gotten to go with my brew has been mouth watering and delicious. . . They release seasonal beers every so often, and will open up with a growler sale where you can come in and buy it to take home.  Also, I understand that they will have lunch specials with things like elk burgers which I really want to try. . . I'd say the only down side is the lack of parking, so I'd recommend arriving extra early and parking a ways down 8th street to walk in.
Knowing four peaks for the beer i decided to try out the actual restaurant for the  food .   The food was AMAZING! I got the chicken pita and it was very flavorful and delicuous. I also tried the BBQ chicken pizza and the chicken tenders all great!  The service was fast and great. The hefenwizen beer was great. The atmosphere was awesome, because your actually in the middle of the brewery.  I can't wait to go  back.
Went here with the fam last night.  Food was great!  Had the Spanikopita app which was amazing.  Popper burger had good flavor and right up my spice alley.  My wife who normally doesn't eat a whole burger finished her entire burger because it was so good.. . Beers were great too.  We enjoy a good IPA and the Hop Knot did the job.  . . Its says its not good for kids but they were very accommodating and it was the perfect environment for my boisterous 2 year old who loves to sing at restaurants.  Im assuming the recommendation is for late night hours but our early dinner was perfect for her.
I actually first heard about this place while visiting another restaurant. Coming from RI, I was visiting my mom and sister and was looking to sample some local beers. Our waiter recommended a few and I ended up getting the peach ale which was light and delicious. He then told me of Four Peaks and their other locations so on my last full day in Arizona, we came here for dinner. . . I ordered the chicken beer bread and the beer sampler, both which were wonderful. My sandwich was huge so I ended up taking some home. In addition to the peach ale, I was especially fond of the Kilt Lifter, both for the name and the taste. . . The place seems like it's pretty hopping on the weekends and it can get a bit loud, both of which I didn't particularly mind. The food was great and so was our service. I'll definitely be back!. . P.s. my mom, who is full blooded American Indian, had your posole and could not stop raving about it!
I went here a few weeks ago to celebrate my Fiance's friends promotion. It's obviously hot in AZ in July so it was slightly uncomfortable in Four Peaks Brewery since they use swamp coolers. That actually did not bother me very much because they had an ample amount of fans and the atmosphere of drinking a beer inside the brewery totally makes you get over it. The prices are very good in my opinion. The options they have were overwhelming, in a good way! I had such a hard time picking out an appetizer. I ended up ordering a pitcher of one of their fruity beers. I can't remember what it was called, but it was an ale and it was very good. I got the soft pretzel and it came with 2 dips. I guess one was supposed to be a jack cheddar cheese an the other was a dijon mustard. The pretzel was good, but the dipping sauces were terrible! The cheese sauce was so runny and didn't even taste good. I was surprised to hear that this was their "new sauce" for the pretzels. Bleh. The dijon mustard was alright. I am not a mustard fan at all, but I REALLY like the dijon mustard that Uncle Bear's has for their soft pretzels and I was hoping for something similar. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. I would go back to Four Peaks Brewing Company in a heart beat. Our server handled our large table very well. We had a great time!
First time here, and as good as the food is in Chicago, I'll have to find a reason to fly here. The Carne Adovada is beyond compare, and has a huge depth of flavor. I was a little concerned with how busy the restaurant was, and how quickly the food came out, but it was super flavorful and super tender.. . The beer/beer selection is excellent. Really enjoyed the Lefty's Lager.
My family and I have eaten here a few times.  We feel that the food is adequate and return every now and again for a change of atmosphere from our regular restaurants.. . Last night, we had a group in from out of town so thought we'd take them to Four Peaks.  We called ahead and spoke to a gentleman who told us that "We are never busy on weekday afternoons during the summer" (Um, was he being sarcastic?  He sounded sincere...) and that "There is a big parking lot that most people don't know about behind the restaurant and to the east."  He also said that reservations were not necessary because they were not busy, nor did they expect to be.. . We were surprised when we arrived and the "big parking lot" was actually very small and entirely occupied.  In fact, it was so cramped that it required driving backward for a significant amount of time to exit because there was no room to turn around.  The only parking we were able to find was probably 1/4 to 1/2 mile away down the street.  Since I am hugely pregnant and my sister has a small baby and it was 113 degrees outside, our family members dropped us off in front of Four Peaks while they went to park the car so that we would not have to walk in the heat.. . When we approached the hostess (who, by the way, is located outdoors), we had to wade through a decently-sized crowd (also waiting for tables).  We were told that "until the majority of the party arrived, we could not put our name on the list."  In a normal restaurant, this would only seem fair because customers can sit or stand in an air conditioned building.  However, we were only 1 person short of having the majority of our party there and that person was parking the car.  The only reason he was not there yet was because this facility does not bother to provide its customers with a place to park their vehicles.  Having lived in the DC area for the last 6 years, I can say that this is to be expected in a big city but in Arizona, it is unacceptable to me.  Most every other business has to pay for/provide parking for their customers.  What makes Four Peaks so special?. . My mom asked how long the wait would be.  "We cannot tell you until the majority of your party is here."  Based on their silly little policy, I guess this would make sense.  She asked, "If the person is here within 5 minutes, how long would the wait be?"  We were told 25-30 minutes... which is far from what we were told when we called ahead.  Given, I understand it would have been impossible for the man we spoke with 30 minutes earlier to predict a massive influx of customers immediately before we arrived but at the same time, it does seem a little more than ironic that this would happen on this very day within 30 minutes of our telephone call.  I can only deduce that he was being dishonest.. . My mom asked if we could wait somewhere with air conditioning since we were there with a pregnant person and a baby.  The hostess pointed to the bar area, which was not an option for us because we were there with two minors.  So, basically, we were given two options: stand outside in 113 degree weather and no shade with a pregnant lady and a baby for 25-30 minutes, or leave.  We chose to leave.. . Unfortunately, since parking was such a nightmare, it took us some time to reconnect with the person who drove as well as with the other two vehicles in our party that were just arriving.  It was a serious mess.  Had it not been so terribly hot, it would have just been inconvenient.  Factor in the heat and it became a health hazard.  . . A little customer service goes a long way.. . We will not return.
I am not a huge fan of Four Peaks.  The special harvest brew they do in the fall is great.  Their beer over all is pretty good too and the staff is always pretty nice and fast considering the number of people that come here.. . There are a few problems with Four Peaks though.  First off, everyone comes here.  It is always crowded and loud as a result.  You will be hoarse after having a meal here just from trying to talk to the person across from you.  . . Second, the parking situation is awful here.  You have to park on the street in an area with lots of no parking signs.  This means you will have to park pretty far away usually, and if you find parking on a Saturday night, even if it is half a mile away, you are grateful to have found a spot at all.  No thanks!. . Finally, the food here is not so great.  Also, a lot of it is fried and really unhealthy.  . . If you are looking to just have a beer with your friends at a good brewing company, I would try another brewery.  Since it is near ASU, there are quite a few close by.
Possibly my favorite place to eat the food excellent the beer heavenly and for any sports occasions awesome i suggest if u haven't been get ur ass here asap they also have daily chef specials soooooo good
Best beer in Arizona.  Kiltlifter is hands down my favorite.  Oh wait ... Peach Ale is my favorite .... They're all sooooo good!!! And the food! The food is so delicious!
Get half peach and half Kiltlifter... I call it the Peachlifter! Awesome food and beer. You can seriously order anything here and it will be amazing. Nachos, wings, chicken beer bread, pizza, carne adovada...wish they had one on the west side!
Food's great, beer's great, service is great.  Really, what more can you ask?  I'm particularly a fan of the Kilt Lifter and Peach ales, and the fish and chips are spectacular.
I'm sorry but everything from the drinks to the appetizer to the meal was so bad I wanted to send everything back. I tried the Peachy Keen drink-yuk...had the calamari appetizer with Panko crust-ummm I guess it was OK at best. The crust was too thick and you could barely taste the calamari. I ordered the hot wings-half buffalo half thai-disgusting. Worst wings I have ever had. My friends had the burgers and they liked them-so if you end up here don't order what I had. My other friend ordered the Sunday flatbread special-they forgot the bacon, and she couldn't eat it. It was that bad...bar food at its worst. I won't EVER be back. Save your money and go elsewhere
i had some really good times here with friends and...The Sampler:) . Great place to hang out, the food is good and if you are unsure of which beer you want to get, just get a Sampler...or two:)
Amazing patio at night! Perfect for relaxing! I love that it is in the heart of Tempe, but doesn't feel like it! The veggie burger & Kiltlifter are heavenly! The Oatmeal Stout is perfect for winter!
This is my 3rd visit to four peaks and this time i wanted to try the happy hour, which sadlyends at 6pm instead of the more traditional 7pm.  It was a very hot day and the brewery did not have the ac on so the place was a little muggy and the restrooms were really muggy.  The beer was good!  I had the kilt lifter, 8th street and the stout.  The stout was my favorite.  I also tried the artichoke dip served with tortilla chips and pita bread which was really good.  All in all, its a really nice place with a nice happy vibe to it but they gotta turn the air on.
