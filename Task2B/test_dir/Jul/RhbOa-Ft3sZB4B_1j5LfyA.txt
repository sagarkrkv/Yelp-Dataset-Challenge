Came here this morning for breakfast with my friends! I'm in Vegas for the next month and was looking for something close by the house we are staying at. . . Mr. Mamas is right down the street and I can't wait to go back! Their breakfast menu is very similar to most diners, and it's absolutely amazing! . . We ordered: chicken fried steak and eggs, French toast, sausage and gravy biscuits and hash browns. . . Everything was really well executed. Simple, but flavorful food. Despite the unhealthy sounding names, the meal did not feel heavy. . . I'll definitely be back, and will be sure to tell my other friends about this spot as well. . . Happy customer
Mmmm good breakfast I've had the French Toast and the California Omelet Both were great. If your looking for a quick breakfast spot try this one. Clean! Great Food for the $ and service w a smile.
First time visitor to Mr. Mama's and was looking for something off the Las Vegas strip so as not to spend every dime we had in one sitting... We also wanted something reasonable, local and good. Well Mr Mama's had good reviews so we gave it a try and sure enough the prices were good, the customer service was even better and the food was great... fresh, filling and hot. The owner and his staff treat you as if you were in their home... We watched the owner interacting with customers and children and he was very kind, generous and loving and you could tell he really enjoyys making people happy. This is the reason I gave it 5 stars... Keep up the good work!
This place had great service and atmosphere.  The food was great.  Definitely will be going again.
This place was OUTSTANDING!!!! From the service to the hot food. This is our everyday breakfast location from now on. Even though the owner is a Michigan fan we loved it!!! O-H...
Best Breakfast in Las Vegas! Nick, the owner greets each customer, talks to them, and thanks each guest. The staff are very pleasant and really take care of all your needs. . . We have been coming here for nearly a year.  We've tried several other places, but this tops them ALL!
Had the Cal Omelet. Ask for extra Pico de Gallo, it is fresh and wonderful flavor. My wife had the short stack, light, fluffy with thick sliced bacon. Great spot if you have transportation from the Strip
Ate here a couple weeks ago. Had chicken fried steak and eggs. Typical sysco frozen steak with gravy that just had TOO much sausage in it . The gravy was tasty but sausage saturated. I'll bet it would be good on Biscuits though.Service slow but ok.Just better out there.
I came this morning with my teenage sons. With all the high reviews on yelp and my.love for breakfast I had to give it a try. sadly I can only give three stars. the staff all seem vert nice and were on top of everything. I had the bf burrito... sadly - bland. no salt or pepper or seasoning of any kind. One son had a chili omelette... the flavorful rs very muted and the sauce on top was not good. the redeeming dish... my other son's steak and eggs. tastey steak cooked medium, very good home fries. so if I.come again I think I will stick with a basic breakfast.
For an amazing breakfast you HAVE to eat at Mr. Momma's. It's only a short distance from the Strip but well worth the time. Our server was Julie who was extremely pleasant and always kept our coffee cup full ( fresh ground beans every pot) .....Nick ( the owner) personally sits and chat's with each and every table, he is a very easy going and happy man. My wife had pancakes, bacon and eggs, I opted for the Western omelet and a cup of their famous sausage gravy....everything was fresh and extremely flavorful.....prices are a bargain compared to the Strip.We will be eating breakfast here each morning of our stay......you won't be disappointed.
It's a bit of a drive from the strip, it's in an industrial strip mall, and it's FABULOUS. The food is well priced,  yummy,  and the service is better than most upscale eateries.   The owner is friendly and does a great job managing customers and his staff.   Eat here.  You won't be disappointed.
When we arrived, we weren't sure about this place.  It's a hole in the wall amongst hardware stores. The host/owner was very friendly and greeted us when we walked in the door.  There was a 30-35 min. wait, but it was totally worth it!  The food was amazing. I had an omelet with cheese that was melted perfectly and the eggs were not over cooked. My wife had the French Toast and it was delicious.  The restaurant itself is a little hot, but it's tolerable. Over all, we had a great experience. We will be returning soon!
Me and my boyfriend are always looking for a good place to have breakfast , I found Mr. Mamas here on yelp . And let's just say this place was everything I could expect ! Delicious food , I had the Spanish omelet  , it was so cheesy and the spinach was cooked perfect my boyfriend tried the French toast and I finished them off because they were truly outstanding ! Definitely coming back for more :)
My friends and I were looking for a good breakfast place and found Mr.Mama's on yelp. The waiters and host were really friendly. The food took a little long but it was definitely worth the wait. The food was just what we were looking for and at a great price.  I would definitely recommend Mr.Mama's to anyone looking for a great breakfast joint.
Perfect way to end our Vegas trip. I had the French toast with bacon and it couldn't have been better for this tiny gem of a diner.  Bacon was perfectly cooked and the French toast was soft and fluffy. Small wait but the instant a table opened it was bussed and set up. Next time I come to Vegas I will skip the overpriced breakfasts on the strip and make the 10 minute drive for breakfast here.
Heading away from the strip on our way home. Needed to grab breakfast. Tried this place because of the already great reviews that I will add to. This place is fantastic! Service was awesome. Food came fast and it tasted fabulous. Not to mention the cheapest breakfast we have had our entire stay! Will be coming back here every time we visit. And will be passing it along to friends and family.
We just arrived in Vegas and read the reviews on local restaurants. We read about Mr Mama's and decided to have breakfast there. The food was great, but the staff is what made the difference. They were super friendly which made the food taste even better. Our daughter Eileen loved the home made pancakes. Needless to say, we went back the next day for seconds. Pay them a visit, you'll love the prices, service, and a nice break for the strip cattle lines! Enjoy!!
Best breakfast in Vegas. I come here every trip to Vegas to play poker. The owner/mgr is really nice and the food is great! Pancakes, French toast or an Omelet you can't go wrong.
Great/cheap/fast breakfast. Had white chocolate chip pancakes... amazing!! Not sure why this isn't a common thing, but it was fantastic.
Amazing! The food and customer service is wonderful! My friends and I ordered pancakes, French toast, eggs, and home potatoes. The bacon was the best. It's about a ten minute drive from the strip. Very small, but wait is only about ten minutes! Definitely go! All the staff care! (:
If I could give this 0 stars I would and usually give good reviews. I found this place on Yelp because it had great reviews. If you like plenty of food and treated like SHIT! Then this is the place. I checked in and ask for a table for 8. I was told "It's probably going to be a 39 minute wait and I'm gonna have to split you guys up". We said, "No problem" . We were seated within 10 minutes and my group was split up about 2 tables away. About 2 minutes later, before we ordered anything or even got water, a table opened up right next to me. I asked the waiter, can we move to this table so I can be next to my family. They said, "We have to ask the boss". The waiter told his boss, "they want to play musical chairs". The manager there told me that he wasn't able to give us the table, that he already gave the table away (even though they were still cleaning it). They we were "WELL, YOU CAN EITHER EAT HERE, OR LEAVE ". So we left. I get, he was busy and didn't need our business. . . I enjoy using Yelp because I try to support small businesses. I feel like bigger chains don't give you good service because they don't need your business or value it.  This place, definitely doesn't value your business. Actually, there was a worker there that apologized for her boss. The "boss" was a jerk, no eye contact or nothing. . . It worked out well for us, we left and went to the Bear Diner. It cost a little bit more money, but the service was excellent and the food was great.
Big mamma.... Big review!  We were staying at Mandalay Bay and could not use our MyVegas 2 fo1 buffett coupons on Saturday.  Not going to pay $30 for their mediocre buffet for adults and $25 for kids.  Raffles breakfast menu averaged $17 per entree.  What happened to the $3.99 steak and egg deals?. . Big mammas is great with huge portions!  Fluffy pancakes.  No kids menu but simply split plates with no fee.  A hop skip and jump from the strip.
Absolutely GREAT service. Its PACKED because everyone knows this is a hot spot. Locals and visitors alike. Waited about 20-30 minutes. Not bad considering theres always 2 or more parties waiting it seems. Breakfast was less than $30 for two people plus 3 drinks. Huge portions. The most expensive thing on their menu is a 1 pound meat burger and the chicken fried steak. Nothing is over $12. Avg meal is $8. Great greeter, jokes around and is super friendly. going back tomorrow before we head back home.
They serve the most amazing pancakes. Service was fantastic as well.
Excellent breakfast. Look forward to coming back next time we are in Vegas. We will definitely make this a regular stop .  The western omelette was delicious
I can always appreciate a great local spot where the owner cares about his patrons and Mr. Mama's is definitely one of those restaurants. Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by the owner who was extremely nice and caring regarding our experience. Mike, the server who took our order, made sure we were taken care of and that our food requests were fulfilled. We opted for a to-go order of two breakfast burritos (one sausage and one bacon) and grabbed a French toast breakfast for the little one that was with us. A last minute add of avocado to the breakfast burrito made it quite remarkable. The location is about 5-10 minutes away from the strip but is worth the travel if you're looking for good food off the beaten path. More than anything, the quality service would bring me back to Mr. Mama's again.
Came in because of the yelp reviews trying to find a good place off the strip. I was skeptical but now I see why this place has such good reviews the food is great,  good sized meals, and excellent customer service!!!! Our waitress Melissa was so sweet and upbeat! I would definitely recommend this place who is sick of the strip prices while in Vegas and wants a good homecooked meal with great service!!
I think this place is delicious! The service was great and the build-your-own omelette I got for myself was amazing. Everything on the menu sounded delicious! Portion sizes were very generous and I ended up not finishing my plate while still feeling very full in the end
Decided to go to breakfast before the movie...found this on yelp.  We had pancakes, eggs, breakfast burritos, home fries, chicken fried steak.  Let me say that we have found a new breakfast spot.  Everyone was so friendly and the food was greeeaat!  Really enjoy it and we will return.
Mom, the boy and I all had the Mama Short stack with 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, and 2 eggs.  We all rated it a 4.  Very good breakfast, and the owner was walking around talking to customers, relaying the family history, which was displayed  on the walls.. . The service was super-great and the overall vibe of the place was wonderful.  I only wish I lived closer to Vegas to go to this place all the time.  It is good....please eat here!
Best breakfast off of the strip hands down. When this place says it gives you a home cookin feel, it most definitely does. The service was excellent, we got greeted by a cool friendly dude who had to handle the mass traffic. I went in there on a Monday like around 12 and it still took us 20 minutes to get sat. The locals rave about this place and it's packed so it's a good situation. Our server was real cool and attentive. I asked her what was the commotion about and she recommended the Mamas special which is the 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 turkey bacon and hash browns for $10. So I'm all in. The food takes the normal 20 minutes to make and it comes out looking all outstanding. Fluffy buttermilk pancakes with the perfect texture and sweet taste. The eggs and hash browns were seasoned and garnished with great flavor. The turkey bacon was cooked perfectly to the point before it becomes overtly crispy. I ate everything in it's entirety. Great Customer Service all around and if you're a baseball fan you can talk all day with Mr. Mama himself about your team vs his Detroit Tigers. Good food and good peoples.
This place is awesome !!! Amazing service from start to finish, super friendly staff and great food!!!!
The food at this place may well be as good as many Yelpers say, but we never got to find out. After driving 6 mi in search of a great local breakfast joint, we arrived at Mr. Mamas to find a short line out the door. We patiently waited at end of the line for the guy to take our name. Another couple arrived at the curb after us, only to be approached immediately by the balding guy with the clipboard, obviously bypassing us. It's clear that this place only wants to serve you if you're white, so if you're not, don't bother coming to this racist joint. There are plenty other restaurants who want our business.
Fantastic breakfast establishment.  Super friendly staff and nice assortment of entrees.  Clean and pleasant dining with low prices.  Only complaint I have would be the portions.  Breakfast burrito was great but it's toddler material.  Not all bad, wasn't placed in a food coma for the day as I was hoping for (half kidding).  Will return most definitely.
All I can say is order the chicken fried steak. Very good gravy.  Service is excellent here too.
Me. Mamas is located in a little strip mall with not many tables and with that is a wait. The greeter and the guy that seats you is funny and very personable. One thing that sticks out that he kept say was, "it's worth the wait". Well he was right, it is worth the wait. He must have said that to all that came in and as the ones the had eaten already were leaving, I heard them say to him your right it was worth the wait. . I had the ribeye and scrambled eggs with home fries. The ribeye was cooked to the way I requested and the home fries were really tasty. . Then I added some of the gravy on the potatoes. Let me say that gravy is phenomenal perfect on top of anything on my plate. The service was quick and wait staff very pleasant. And yes as I left I said to the greeter "it was worth the wait". Enjoy your meal.
This place is great! Great prices, great food! Normally going to breakfast restaurants don't cook the eggs right. Eggs were cooked perfect! The owner was here and very helpful.
This place is absolutely delicious and very affordable!!! . . My husband and I have been here twice so far. It is so worth the drive from the north west. Their food is fresh and the staff is awesome. Our drinks were always filled and the food is great!. . We will definitely be returning.
Took about 40 min to be seated. The place was packed at noon on a Sunday. Food is good. Prices are reasonable and the service is friendly. Not the nicest ambiance (bright blue walls like a movie studio) but overall enjoyed the food.
This place is amazing!  Vacationing in Vegas, looking for a locally owned place...Mr. Mama's won't disappoint. The French toast was perfect, our server let my son sample their unique sausage gravy with a hint of maple syrup, and burgers with fresh avocado slices. Oh, and a perfect cup of coffee with beans ground on the premises. We left happy and stuffed!
My dad and I went last week. I have to say that it is very reasonable with prices. The build your omelette was a great option for me. I took one star because the server had an attitude with my dad. I will defiantly will go back.
Fantastic breakfast!!!!. Cheap and very good food and service.. Kids loved it!!!. We will come back!!
Had the biscuits and gravy and they were not the best. I have had better at other resturants so I was a bit disappointed but the service was great and everyone was friendly their.
I like this place my wife is on the fence. Nice wait staff and food is good what else do I need.
Fast, quick, exactly what you would expect from a breakfast restaurant. Passing through Las Vegas and we noticed this place had 4.5 stars.  The staff is friendly & accommodating. Thank you Yelp!
Hubby & I are visiting from San Diego & were looking for a breakfast spot outside of the hotel buffets... This definitely hit the spot... we ordered the Chicken Fried Steak which came with homemade gravy, potatoes, eggs, & toast. Nice sharable portions! We also got French Toast with Bacon... Everything was so fresh and delicious! Mr. Mama chatted with us... super cordial. Everyone working there is family & made us feel at home. I plan to return before we leave to try the lunch menu!
Dayum, that was some tasty porridge! There was a bit of a wait when we got there but Mr. Mama himself was right there encouraging everybody that the wait was worth it, and he was right. And for that matter the wait turned out to be a fraction of what he said it would be. Had the California omelette. Wasn't sure if I was going to be able to finish it because I'd had a couple of donuts at the Honda dealership. But I did!
A delicious breath of fresh air just off the craziness of the strip. Their breakfast is really good, and for a great price. Greek Omelette was huge and filled with lots of feta! Their French toast is thick and cinnamony! Everyone was really friendly and the service was terrific.
Really clean and friendly staff, the host was very personal and made everyone feel welcome as well as seating us very fast. . . The menu had a good selection of breakfast and lunch items on it and we ordered Spanish omelet, Short stack and grits. The food was made fast and to order and tasted amazing.. . The only down side is that they don't have a kids menu but everything was really spectacular.
Here for Roller Con..needed some amazing food and found Mr. Mama's ... soooo good. .biscuits and gravy..fat kid is happy and ready to skate !!!! And Mr. Mamma St the front door to greet you with his smile and charm..make it even better! !
Ordered the French toast, chicken fried steak and the biscuits and gravy. They all came out pretty quickly and in large portions. We were famished when we came in and left completely stuffed. Believe the Yelp Hype. This place ROCKS!!!
The food was good and the waiter was nice. I sent back my French toast and traded it out for a cinnamon roll. The chicken fried steak and cinnamon roll is the bomb.defiantly come back
We were looking for a good breakfast place and found Mr Mama's restaurant. We waited for a minutes and the greeter gave us a menu  to check out . Love their.cinnamon roll and the Denver omelet. My husband and my dad.enjoyed their pancakes. Also, my dad got a cinnamon bread for his 87th.bday..... We will definitely come back for breakfast.
Almost didn't wait but waiting for a table was well worth it. Fast service and excellent food.
Great food, good service and affordable breakfast place.  We had to take two buses three buses to get here but it was worth it.
First time in vegas and my wife and I wanted to find a nice place off the strip and found the reviews for Mr mamas and decided to try it out. . . Food is great, service is even better and it has that quieter feeling when you just want to get away from the strip chaos. . . Another thing is this place reminds us of one of our favorite breakfast joints we visit in savannah georgia when visiting family called the breakfast place.
My girlfriend friend and I went to this place and it took about an hour to be seated and after getting a table our waitress didn't bring us a drink. Any other guy did after seeing that we were upset. To TOP it off 3 other customers sat after us and received their foods and some finished eating while ours was still being made. I order 2 pancakes and bacon and my girl ordered a California Omelet. This place might have great food food but the SERVICE SUCKS and so I just paid for the drinks and walked out.I WOULDN'T recommend this place to anyone. I wish I rate this in the NEGATIVES.
My family tried Mr Mamas this morning after seeing the great Yelp reviews.  .      I had the 2 egg breakfast with hash browns, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Absolutely perfect scrambled eggs and scrumptious hash browns. I don't know how they make their hash browns; they look like ordinary diner hash browns but there is something special about them that I can't put my finger on.  My family enjoyed their meals as well, a breakfast burrito, rib-eye and eggs, and Mama's French Toast.  .      Very friendly wait staff and fast service.  I can't wait till our next Vegas trip so I can try more items.
Ever get that one yelper stinker? this was it for me. I really wanted to like this place, like really really like it. I was sorely let down by the reviews. I dont understand what there is to rave about. I ordered biscuits and gravy and the hubby got an omlette(cant be bothered to remember it) biscuits were ok, loaded with butter- not that theres anything bad with that, but thats just it. the gravy was too thick, almost like gelatin, sausage in the gravy lacked flavor. gravy just lacked flavor, where was the hint of maple syrup the hostess kept talking about? one more thing.......seasoning people, if you can't make it taste like it has a 'hint' of maple syrup, make sure there's enough seasoning. The only thing that helped improve this meal? the 2 over easy eggs i had ordered and then promptly placed on top of my meal with pepper and salt.. . hubbys omlette was just meh as well.......and that frustrates me alot, because for a breakfast place to produce cripy omelletes? again lack of flavor, egg was way over cooked, it was so blah i dont even remember what all was in it much less came with it.. . totally affordable, but i guess i got what i paid for and definately not worth the 30 minute wait for us.. . We're foodies at heart and love mom and pop places but this place made me just want to take my business to an IHOP.. . btw the coffee sucked to!
Three words. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Absolutely happy with everything. Very reasonably priced, super friendly, and the food was wonderful. We couldn't ask for anything more, except a location closer to us because we want to make this restaurant a frequent stop!
Brought the whole family here and this place was great!  Great food and GREAT prices. Fed a family of 6 for 55 bucks.  His food is much better than a cafe at a casino an at a third I the price. The owner is amazing!  He is hands on and makes sure EVERY customer leaves happy and satisfied.  We will be back!!
Great spot for breakfast before heading back to LA and great service. Will surely return next time I am in Vegas.
Wow good call yelpers. Seriously amazing food huge portions and the service was awesome. The owner was the nicest man and talks to everyone. I got ham and cheese omelet and hash browns and my boyfriend got chicken fried steak and eggs. The gravy was soooooo good. Light fluffy pancakes too. If you are looking for great food off the strip mr mamas is your place
A standard diner with a depressing atmosphere. The food was perfectly acceptable. Not a good value. Simply meh.
One thing I have noticed about Las Vegas is that the customer service is on another level. We were in town for a basketball tourney and the team was staying down the street from this establishment and decided to stop for a bite before a long day of games. We were greeted by the owner and he was super cool and made sure he establish a relationship with everyone of his customers. The food was solid we ordered the French toast combo that came with eggs and hash brown and a few breakfast burritos. All In all a good experience!
