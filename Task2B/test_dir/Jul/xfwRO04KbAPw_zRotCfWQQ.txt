The best food with the largest portions & great prices...
I have been to this place several times, but had just forgotten to write a review, until now.. This place fits me like a glove.. It's the only non-all-you-can-eat restaurant that satisfies my appetite.. The food is also very appealing to the eye.. I had their roast chicken, and it had these very thin, crunchy garnishes on top of it. Even after I ate them I had no idea what they were so I asked the waiter.. Turns out that they were deep-fried linguini strands. I never would have guessed that.. I smile when I picture the look on first-timers' faces when they get their meals served to them on these humongous plates. I can only assume that they are happily surprised.. I don't think I've ever seen meals that large on one plate.. No one who has joined me for breakfast, lunch or dinner, has been able to finish their meal (and once I'm done with my plate, I cannot eat the remainder of any other plate).. I've had most of their menu, but I'm most impressed with their chicken pot pie.. The pastry easily reaches 6 inches above the plate.. They're breakfast skillets are great, I've tasted their desserts and they're simply decadent. . The service is good.. We've never had to wait to be seated, but they have a bar/waiting room which looks very bright and comfortable.. The pictures that I've seen, show the pretty plating, but you really have to go there to fully appreciate the portion size.
Love Hash House! Soo much great food and drinks!
Pros: Massive portions. Tastes delicious. Cool atmosphere.. . Cons: Expensive. Pretty boring menu.. . I always thought that Hash House was good, but just lacking creativity. . . Ohhhh massive pancakes; how original! . . There's nothing special about Hash House, but they are consistent and the food tastes fine.
If you are going to Hash House A Go Go, I would definitely recommend going to this location. The overall decor & dining experience is much nicer. . . As for the food, better come hungry because the portion sizes are huge! Everyoneraves about the sage chicken & waffles, as they should because it is phenomenal. I usually get the waffles with glazed bananas & pecans on top and it is one of the most delicious breakfast meals I've had to date. Also, their drinks are just as tasty. I'm a big fan of Bloody Mary's and the BLT Bloody Mary doesn't disappoint. Hot chocolate is great too! . . Overall, I would say if you are looking for a hearty, delicious breakfast Hash House is a great place to go.
Located in the Quad, it's a very good chicken and waffle experience.  It might have made my list of "must-go" places when in Vegas.. . We split the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower between two people based on the server's advice.  Service was excellent by the way.  The portion was definitely enough for us and should be enough for two people with regular appetites.. . The bacon-stuffed waffle to me wasn't that special, but the syrup was very good.  If you have a craving for fried chicken and waffles, this is a great spot.  Prices are what you'd expect in a Vegas restaurant and splitting an entree brings it down.  Definitely worth checking out.
It's fine.  Not sure it is as good as it used to be.  It's getting a little run down, but I wonder if that is because they have opened up a bunch of different locations and maybe this one isn't going to be around much longer.  The chicken was pretty decent but the waffles were a little soft.  Overall this place is fine, but it's just not on my regular rotation list.
Great atmosphere. The servers were excellent very attentative to our needs. The menu was absolutely amazing there's so many different food and drink fusions which was exceptional. . . Once the food arrived I was amazed at the large portions of food given. The good was both healthy and hearty.
I think many people get the large portions mixed up with the  over all flavor. The food here is ok but not fantastic. They also give you way too much, so you tend to over eat. Chicken and waffles: The breading was good on the chicken but the chicken was dry. Waffles were ok but I have had much better. Meat loaf hash was ok but fairly dull. The sausage gravy was really good.
my family and i got to this place and i would've rather gone somewhere else but we wanted to try it we sat down and got our drinks we didnt order anything special me and my sister split a meatball pasta because the prices here are expensive after more than half an hour the waiter comes and tells us our food will be out soon we wait about 10 more minutes and finally our food came people who came after us already had their food the pasta was really spicy i did not like it and neither did my sister or father so we decided to get ice cream at thrifys the only reason im rating it one star is because the staff was nice it was also really cold in there i just feel like it wasnt worth the hour long wait
Definitely a fan of Hash House! I had been going to the location in San Diego for years now and I was very happy to see that they have made their way to Vegas. It is pretty pricey here but you get your money's worth. It's A LOT of food! Perfect sharing portions. . Its very welcoming to everyone. You'll see all types of people from families to hungover twenty something's(especially in Vegas)!. Happy eatings!
Excellent food and service every time. All the hype is well-deserved and the serving are HUGE. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the usual wait on the weekends.
All I have to say is wow!! Hash House a Go Go went way beyond my expectations. The serving portions are huge. The food is excellent and the service was great. . . We got there about noon and it was packed but still only waited 5 minutes for a table. We both ordered the caramel mocha latte which was to die for although I only drank half of it because it comes with 2 extra toast shots of espresso. I ordered the chicken sage waffles and my girlfriend ordered the banana cinnamon french toast. They were both absolutely to die for. . . This is a must for any local or tourist. They have a wide variety of things on the menu and they're not overly expensive. I would definitely give it an 8 out of 10.
Food was delicious. I had the sage fried chicken and waffles and only finished a quarter of my meal, took the rest home and had it for dinner- which fed two of us. Bloody Mary's were delicious too. I don't remember or care what my friend ordered, but he ate more than half and took the rest home too. . Wait was about 15 minutes for lunch on a Friday and the staff was really cool. Next time I'm in town, I will be back.
Great Burgers I had the Potato burger excellent choice! Good service in every aspect.
We rolled the dice in Vegas (hubby wanted this place, I wanted blueberry hill)...and I feel like maybe we should have went with blueberry hill. . The atmosphere is so neat- I love the whole farm to table thing and it has this whole hee haw meets hipster vibe which I dig. . Our waitress didn't have a name tag on. She was attentive, my one complaint being the level of food education she has had. Example: I asked that the eggs be dairy free. She says, "the eggs have no dairy added but since they are eggs they are dairy. Is that OK? They are dairy". I think if you make a big deal about your food your wait staff should know a thing or two, amiright?. Food came out and we were shocked. Chicken and waffles were HUGE. Pancakes, HUGE. Scramble, pretty big. Lots of food! . . Hubby ordered the spinach cheese and ham scramble. It came with a biscuit and honey dew, and he opted for the fried potatoes. . I got the sage chicken and waffles. . Littles got chocolate chip pancakes.. The tiny one got the eggs I mentioned above.. Hubby: " the blandest most boring meal I've had in a while. I could have made it at home. The potatoes were just plain. It reminded me of hospital food" (side note: he is really easy to please breakfast wise). Me: taste. Salt. Taste. Salt again. I dug in. Was it different? Yes. Good? Yes.  At 16.99, though, I would have preferred less food more flavor. It was so bland. I gave hubby a bite. He was like. Wow that's really bland. So it wasnt just me lol. . Kids loved their pancakes. Given. Their favorite pancakes are from IHOP. But no complaints. They were huge! We could have had them split. . The tiny one's eggs were cooked perfectly. No dairy except well.... According to the waitress they are dairy. Hmm... . All in all, this place could have been 5 stars. I just can't because the food was really really bland. I probably would give it another try though, could be just a cook issue.
Great food, definitely lives up to it's reputation
giant portions and good brunch items.
a must for breakfast.. expect to wait at least 1/2 hour. you will not belive the portions
This place was highly recommended by a friend so wedecided to check it out.  We chose this location versus the ones closer to where we were staying on the Strip in hopes of it being less crowded.  It was packed when we got there and were told that it would be a 15-20 minute wait, but luckily got seated within 5 minutes.  Customer service was great and the food came pretty quickly.  The portions are large enough to share between 2 people.  Unfortunately, the food wasn't as great as we thought it would be.  I ordered The Kokomo, which was a meatloaf sandwich and it turned out to be pretty dry.  I will probably consider eating here again and maybe trying something different.
Good food and large portions. We went to Hash House a Go Go based almost entirely on its Yelp reputation. We both tried a variety of Hash and were both satisfied. I'd go back if I ever visit Vegas again, but we might share a meal since we didn't really have a way to store our leftovers.
Awesome food!!  Great service!   Be prepared very large portions.  Fun place to chat with others, inquire  what they are having.   I will return to try the dinner menu
Food was decent. The portions are pretty large. I was not impressed since my order was wrong, my husband finished his good and that was exactly when mine came back. I wish the service would of been better!
Great food!! Great service!!! We needed a quick meal and the server made it happen. When we needed our check manager come by to help out since server was at another table (instead of the usual "I will send you server over shortly") then the server promptly followed up!! Will come back again!!
Hash House is delicious. The servings are gargantuan! Service is good, waiters are friendly. . . I've been there a handful of times and food quality is always between 4-5 stars but isn't so perfect all the time. A lot of there menu items dont really stick out to me, so it's one of the reasons why i'm giving it a 4.. . I'm also marking it down because the portions are just way too big for me and the rest of my family. I'm not a big fan of over-kill and this is a place that does it. . . I always look forward to going back.
Give it a 3 out of 5. My drink was left empty for my whole meal. food was good. I would go back
As my friend pre-warned me, the best bang-for-your-buck food situation that I've experienced in a long time.. . I was warned that the portions were HUGE, and this was accurate. We sat in the bar area which had a tv and was separated from some larger groups in the main dining room.  As you can see if you check the menu, they have a wide variety of breakfast/brunch/lunch/dinner options. As it was just barely noon, I was expecting to go for a burger or something, but I was swayed by the lure of some legitimate corned beef hash.  The "Hash" options seem to be one of their signature items, as per their name. I went with the Corned Beef which had, obviously, some deliciously prepared corned beef (like, not chopped up pre-packaged frozen stuff - it was as if it had been slow-prepared that day), swiss cheese, red onions (but not too much). The kicker is that it was served over a large amount of delicious oven-fried potato chunks rather than standard hash browns, all in a large square skillet (see picture).  Oh, and it also came with 2 eggs any style, a buttermilk biscuit, and a couple fruit garnishes.  That all was around $13 I think, which might seem like a lot but as I said, it was outrageously proportioned. I didn't even touch the biscuit or the fruit, and it was still very filling.  The taste was great, and I'd recommend it to anyone.
Next time I'm here, hopefully soon, this will be my first go-to place to go for late night food.  Would rather prefer coming here than Cafe Lux.  It's more hip, casual, better lighting instead of the dim.. . extra star for all the trimmings on walls, things to see too.  . . Was here just for a snack, ordered the rosemary chicken wings, and they weren't kidding, a tall herb perched among the nice display of wings---the best I've even seen lol.  Good-size wings.. . Great, friendly service.
The best thing over here is the coke. All the dishes taste bland. I will never come again. This is the worth restaurant in town.
Ok so when I come to HHAGG it's always packed with a wait. That's a good sign right? One time we waited a good 45 minutes but it was Mother's Day after all. Was the wait worth it...yes. . . I'm pretty much a traditional boring person when it comes to food. I like the simpler flavor versus the crazy unique flavors. Whenever I am here I order the corned beef hash which is definitely one if my favorites. Tender corned beef with skillet potatoes and Swiss cheese on top. I'm a cheesy girl and that cheese as weird as it may sound actually pairs well with it. I actually have ordered something off the special menu as well.  The crab cake Benedict on Mother's Day was pretty dang tasty. There was real crab and the crab vs. batter/filling ratio was about 2:1. It came with spinach and a spicy sauce (spicy to me) which was delicious. . . I've ordered drinks from HHAGG before and although good it's just too much. Their famous hot chocolate is huge! It's awesome but when I eat salty foods I like to drink the plain old H20. Overall I do like this place for brunch/breakfast but service can be a bit on the slow side when they have a full house.
Best meal on this trip to Vegas!  Went here for birthday breakfast and had a blackberry granola pancake bigger than my head!  Tasty and tender.  Also enjoyed their fresh-made strawberry lemonade mimosa....delicious!  Great service, great food!
Great service, amazing atmosphere,  good music. The portions that this restaurant gives is insanely worth the price! You will not go wrong by coming here with an empty stomach. The food quality matches the great portions and service. Definitely recommend this place to anyone and everybody, you will not be disappointed. For the amount of food you get the price is perfect, each meal is big enough for 2! Serving breakfast & brunch, all day, can't go wrong. I will be back!
This place is crazy busy something to remember when u go. U r gonna have to wait. But wait bc the food is soooo good it's worth the wait. . All the staff is there to wait on u and get u anything they can possibly get u. They r all the best staff. Please tip well.... It is worth it.
Chicken was bomb.. . The serving was a lot, so come prepared to eat. . . The atmosphere was pretty dope too. They got celebrity pictures and signatures on the wall. Pretty dope.
Love this place, super good food excet make sure you are hungry when you go. I take all my guests here.
Solid food with HUGE portions. Can't wait to go back!
only been to the one at the M hotel, but it is top notch, great food great service
It's kinda pricey but the food are huge. I ordered their French Toast -. dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup. So yummy!!! It was huge and it taste soooo good! I definitelty recommend this place to everyone.
My family and I were visiting from out of town and this place was a MUST GO on my 11 year olds to do list in Vegas.  We went to the Hash House Thursday night for the first time ever and they were already closed however, the waitress asked her Manager Lupe if they would accept us and Lupe gladly took us. We ended up leaving because some of our other friends wanted to join us but figured it would be too much to ask to accommodate a group of 13 after business hours so we decided to leave after all.  On Saturday we decided to revisit for brunch.  We had a group of 6 and waited for approximately 20 minutes for a table.  We received our order within 15-20 minutes after ordering and the place was pretty packed.  After receiving our order the Manager, Lupe approached our table and asked if we were the same group that came late Thursday evening and left, I was very surprised she remembered us.  She thanked us for coming back and glad we decided to revisit.  She brought over a huge plate of the famous waffles with bacon inside on the house.  Very nice gesture.  . Everything we ordered was amazingly DELICIOUS!!!! Since being back home in San Francisco, that's all my husband brags about.  The portions are HUGE!  My family and I can't wait to revisit Vegas so that we can stop by and see Lupe and team.  I can't remember our waitress's name but he was vey knowledgeable and awesome!!! Thanks Hash House for the great experience!!! Lupe you ROCK!!!!
(Man vs. Food) Andy's Sage Fried Chicken did not disappoint. Definitely a meal for 2. The whole meal was $15
Referred to Hash House by locals just after we moved to Las Vegas. I remember large servings of just average breakfast food in a noisy industrial setting. We later discovered the many Cracked Eggs around town, and prefer them when we want to eat breakfast out.
This is one of my favorite places to take friends from out of town- I have friends who saw this on Man vs. Food and were dying to try it.  They absolutely loved it, and of course none of us could finish our meals.  I love the chicken and waffles, which is big enough for two people to split and have some left over to take home. My second favorite dish is the grilled cheese with avocado, each slice of bread is close to 2 inches thick, and that's amazing in my book.. . The second best thing is the drink menu, which has all sorts of amazing drinks that are basically desserts in their own right- hot chocolate, flavored coffee and cappucinos, etc.  I don't drink alcohol, so it's always nice to see a drink menu with special items that I can actually enjoy.
Glad we tried this place. I ordered the "Andy's sage fried chicken" I shared it with my friend. We didn't even finish it! We wanted to try it because it was the man vs. food favorite. It definitely didn't disappoint!! I loved the spicy sauce on top! And the spinach and tomato was a great balance with all the loaded carbs!!! . . Also, the Bloody Mary was great! Definitely a great place for breakfast, or brunch! They serve the breakfast all day too!!! Yummy!
Absolutely delicious! Our waiter Robert was great as well. The Andy's sage fried chicken is by far the best thing on the menu; it's a big sized portion so make sure you're hungry!
Usually when I expect something to be amazing it sucks. This place was actually as good as I thought it would be. I ordered the famous chicken and waffles :) good stuff...between my sis and I we barely finished it. The place is good.. def worth a try and I def would go again when I'm in Vegas.
Love this place!  Awesome service and always great portions. Great for any size group, but the wait can get pretty long.
(April 2014). I SO intended to take a picture of my food but I just dove in too quickly... So, I had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and it was everything Adam (Man vs. Food) made it out to be. So good. So gluttonous. Amen.
Always good, as long as I leave the kids at home.  The Sahara location is still the best.
Their portion of their food is huge. Service is good! They offer biscuits b4 u eat ur ordered food
Sage chicken!!! Need I say more???? I'd rather head to the west side then eat on the strip, came on a busy Friday morning got seated in less then a min. Our server was so great and attentive!
Best breakfast place in Vegas. While everyone likes Eggs and I; these guys have killer hash browns!
This place is no good . All it is . Is over priced big portions of crap . Nothing here is good and this is a review that i wrote on my 3rd visit
You won't find a better breakfast joint anywhere in Las Vegas. Period. Service Excellent. Food Incredible. Pricier than Denny's but wayyyyyy worth it. Go early...and go often
Did a brunch with my boyfriend there, we shared 2 popular items: Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  I had the Banana Latte to drink and he had the Caramel Mocha coffee.  Service was friendly and the waiter was personable.. . The food is great and the portions are plentiful; really pretty large, as seen in pictures.  . . I can't comment on lunch/dinner type foods since both entrees we ordered were breakfast items.  The sage fried chicken was good but dry in some parts.  The bacon waffles under the chicken had a hint of vanilla in them but were overall pretty bland actually.  With syrup and other food items on the plate, the dryness of the waffles is not unbearable.  The maple syrup is heated and served in a small steel cup.  Fried leeks top the chicken and waffles as well as some diced peppers for garnish and the signature stick of rosemary.. . The Sage Fried Chicken [eggs] benedict has an awesome chipotle sauce, not too spicy, just right.  The mashed potatoes were pretty good.  The egg is almost forgotten in this dish, but it is there, with a layer of cheese too.. . Our espresso drinks were excellent...I definitely recommend the Banana Latte.  If I went again I would order only one Sage Fried Chicken dish and try something new.
Amazing Brunch. Portions were so big we couldn't finish but left very satisfied. Very fun atmosphere too. Highly recommend.
This review is mostly for the poor customer service at this location. The front of the house almost seems proud that they don't give a crap. While we've gone here before and experienced broken drink glasses and extremely slow responses, tonight was the last straw. The hostess greeted us and we requested a booth. The restaurant was maybe 30% full, plenty of open booths, but she did not offer to seat us there. I assumed they didn't want to use certain sections. Keep in mind, the place was 70% empty. She didn't offer a drink of water or to look at a menu while we waited. No one working there did.  Other employees, another server and a bartender,  walked by where we were waiting. They actually seemed annoyed by our request.  It just seems like with all the competition for restaurants in Vegas,  somebody there would want to take our money. Or at least be happy someone walked in on a slow midweek evening.  . . This was the last thing we needed after the broken glass incident. We thought "Let's give them one more chance. " So while tonight wasn't the worst ever,  it pissed us off more because the attitudes were so bad.
Came here after a serious night at XS and I couldn't even chew my chicken and waffles, but I could still tell it was pretty damn good.
