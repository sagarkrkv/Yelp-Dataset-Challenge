After watching diners, drive ins and dives, we had to check this place out while in Vegas. My family ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, the spicy miso burger, the Ronin burger, and the pork buns. The food was really good. The spicy miso burger was the best. The friendly service and the unique combination of Asian inspired flavors with traditional fast food American, makes this a place we will be sure to visit again next time we're in town. I'm knocking off 1 star because the boba would've been way better blended, rather than poured over ice, and the oxtail fries didn't have much of a unique 'oxtail' flavor to it.
Had a black and green burger...yummm.  Hidden spot off the strip.  You must check it out.
Definitely away from the strip and traffic which is good, but they need a bigger parking lot! My first impression was good, Bachi Burger seemed like an asian infused burger place that knew how to do things right. . . The only problem I had with this place was service.There was a 20 minute wait in which we said bar or table was okay. After 15 minutes in, the hostess calls the table before us and asked if they wanted to do bar. They said no, and so I went up to ask if we could take the bar seating instead since we were next anyways. The lady says, "sorry, the bar isn't open seating." Umm.. what? The first hostess said that if there was available bar seating she would let us know and seat us. So we were like okay.... I guess. We waited another 10 minutes (she seats a big party of 5 in the meantime) and then calls my name and asks if we were okay with bar seating. Seriously? You rejected us 10 minutes ago.. and then you ask us if we wanted it after? What a waste of time and space. It's just been empty sitting there the whole time.. By this time I was super hangry and unhappy at her, so I just stalked to the bar and sat. . Our guy server at the bar was nice, but was extremely slow. We had to flag down multiple servers and busboys to get our check, and paying for the food was a really long process. For this place being busy all the time, you would think their service should be up to par and they should be running efficiently. But it's not... I would typically minus one for service, but this was at two points (hostess and waitress) where it was lacking.... . Anyways on to the food- which was absolutely delicious.. Salt and pepper fries- they were okay, I really wanted the oxtail fries but I don't think the two of us could stomach that and a burger. Will be back to try that next time!. Miyagi-San- grass fed wgayu beef with bacon, fried egg, onion rings, and japanese spice (added cheddar). This burger was absolutely amazing! Everything was done so well, and the meat was delicious and juicy. Yum... . . Will definitely be back to try different burgers and the oxtail fries. Hope their service improves by the time I return...
It's good, but kind of bland.  I had their green and black burger, and my bf has their miso burger. Miso was actually better than the green/black burger. Their beef patty and buns were actually tender and soft, respectively, but even after adding salt that was provided, it was just a regular gourmet burger joint. Nothing special. Their oxtail fries were good for large groups, but it was ok also. This place is better than Gordon Ramsay's BurGR though.
Honestly all the hype about this restaurant is overrated. . . Oxtail chili cheese fries overly sweet & barely any oxtail. . . Takoyaki was yummy big chunks of octopus.. . Sausages was a tad salty.. . Kiki burger, again too sweet & you couldn't taste the bacon very thin but meat was cooked perfectly. . . Miyagi San was ok nothing special, sane scenario about the bacon. . . Service was fast & great.
Phenomenal burgers! Had the bahn mi and the ronin! Truffle fries but have had heaps better at other locales. But again, amazing burgers... Would go back just for that!
Oxtail-chili-cheese-fries was OK, not as much ox tail as I anticipated,  sweet potato fries good, Burgers good and juicy.  aribiki sausage a bit salty.
Hands down best burger joint I've been to. Affordable and amazing service, our waiter was super friendly. His names Dan :) I got the miyagi sun burger medium well and oxtail fries. Oh my gosh. It was absolutely on point. Very satisfying meal and definitely want to come back here. Be prepared to wait in line though! But it's DEFINITELY worth the wait!!
Awesome Burgers!
Just left. This was our second time here. The food was still very tasty. We were disappointed with a couple of things. We looked at the menu on their website before we got seated and decided what we wanted. When we saw our bill it was six dollars more expensive. Each of our burgers were two dollars more than what the website stated as well as the fries we ordered. I guess the prices have gone up but they never fixed their prices. We also did not receive good service. The hostess was the only good service we had. She was very sweet. Our waiter seemed very confused and unorganized. He seemed to be rushing us the whole time. The service does not match the quality of food. I would still go back for the great burgers but hopefully we will get a different server next time.
Worst service ever by Rob and the manager. . Just asked for no chili mayo and I get a give minute speech about I better not have allergies or they can't serve me. The manager needed me to confirm I can eat everything in the burger and then substituted the fry dip even though my friend could eat it.
The food here was absolutely delicious. However the service (intelligence?) was a bit lacking.. I was in a party of 3 and they seated us at a table meant for 2 people. We asked if we could change to a table that would seat four because we saw a recently cleaned one and the hostess refused us and said that they were already seating another party, which turned out to be only two people! Therefore, our table was very cramped when the food arrived because we had ordered quite a bit. Despite that mishap, the oxtail chili cheese fries were so good and the specialty manga burger was perfectly cooked and juicy and delicious. I will be coming here another time on my next visit to Vegas. Hopefully I'll get better seating though ?
During my recent business trip to Vegas, Bachi Burger was BY FAR the best meal that I enjoyed!  Arriving during the prime dinner period, my friend and I immediately noticed the good amount of people waiting to be seated.  Note: they do not take reservations.  Our party of 2 put our name in and sat down, fully expecting to wait the 30 minutes that we were told by the hostess.  Shockingly, within 5 minutes we were called up and seated; sometimes being just a party of 2 helps a lot!  I ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger, which came topped with chili mayo, a fried egg, furikake, . caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings, as well as their salt & pepper garlic French fries, with a side of pineapple ketchup.  From the first delectable bite to the last, this meal was fantastic.  The burger was prepared perfectly and every bite was FULL (FULL!) of flavor.  The fries were great and the pineapple ketchup was sublime.  I enjoyed three burgers during this recent Vegas trip (Bachi, Fukuburger, and BurGR) and this meal was by far the best!  The two locations are off of the Strip, but do yourself a favor and go!
Yelp has pull down may bad review of the restaurant because it involved Management swearing at it's employees. I thought we had a little thing in this country called the Constitution which guarantees freedom of press. It makes me wonder if business owners are paying off your help to take off bad reviews. Shame I never want involved in this type of practice. If they don't like customers telling the truth about the restaurant they need to change their practices. I have noticed that quite a few reviews of thisnature in regards to this particular restaurant. To be clear. This is a repost. I haven't returned to this place and never will but I will keep reposting if yelp removes it. I believe in free speech and people should know how bad this place is.
Great place for burgers off the strip.  Service was excellent. The staff was knowledgeable on the menu. Had a person with fish allergy in our party and they went above and beyond to accommodate him. The pork belly steamed buns and Bahn mi burger was great. The Oxtail Fries were ok. Nice and trendy atmosphere.
I have come here 2 different times and they have tried to jam both of my groups into a smaller amount of tables. 1 more table would be great. First time it was a group of 15 adults and the 2nd time it was 6 adults and 1 high chair. We tried calling ahead to give them warning both times and they dont take reservations. The wait wasnt to bad either time. Food is amazing.
Definitely one of my favorite burger bars in Las Vegas.  My goal is to go down the menu list and try each one of their burgers. So far, I have accomplished 4. . . Ronin burger: This was my very first burger at Bachi. It is made up of angus beef, caramelized onions, fried egg, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, katsu BBQ, and yuzu citrus aioli. So simple, but so good.. . Shogun burger: The burger consisted of waygu beef & unagi, pan seared foie gras, poached asian pear, miso butter, and yamamomo peach. There were so many flavors going on in my mouth, it's hard to describe the taste. Is it worth $25? Probably not. Is it worth a try? Definitely yes.. . Miyagi-san burger: Another waygu beef burger. Also comes with fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, onion rings, and chili mayo. Great tasting burger. I liked how it was not messy, even though it had so much going on in it.. . Kiki's burger: The most recent burger I tried. This is Bachi's version of a mushroom burger. It's made of angus beef, sauteed shiitake, enoki, and eryngii mushrroms. There's also caramelized bacon and gruyere cheese. Sauce: garlic chili aioli and sweet onion marmalade. I like it. . . If you're feeling extra fatty, get the oxtail chili cheese fries. Pretty heavy. But SO good and savory. Get it to share!. . They also serve ramen here at Bachi. I've tried one of their bowls before but it was not memorable. I don't even remember the name of it. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Just stick with the burgers.. . p.s. Bachi is better than Umami
Definitely did not live up to the hype.  The burger was overcooked (asked for medium, got well done), fries were dry, soda was extremely watered down.  The Shishito Peppers appetizer was pretty awesome, though.. . I had the Mr. Hoe's Burger.  It was tasty enough but not something to write home about.  After hearing so many excellent reviews I was let down in a big way.  There are much better burger joints in town.
This had become a tradition for my group that I go to Vegas with! We drink, gamble, and when were down to our last $20-30 then we go here! When you come here you forget all the money you've lost and end the trip on a happy note! I personally love onions and egg on my burger and so I recommend getting the Miyagi Burger! It goes for about $13.50. Then add some fries and a coke and the total should come out to around 20 usually. The first time I had the oxtail chili cheese fries and found a hair in it, but they were so nice they gave us a whole new chilli cheese fries and all the drinks were free (about a group of 10-12 of us). The meat they use and bread is just different. It is like the first meal they give you once you get to Heaven. lol I might be over exaggerating, but its definitely my favorite burger (better than Umami, DogHaus, In-n-out, etc).. . Recommendations. Dont come into the place thinking of all the hype you hear and just judge it for being such great quality. A bit pricey, but not some where you go to eat everyday either. Be ready to spend at least 20 if you want a meal.
Best burger joint in vegas. It's good that they combined bachi with their ramen place next door. Been here at least 10 times, the food has always been good. Service used to good but now it's very average.
These Asian fusion flavors will make an indelible impression on any burger fan willing to branch out and try something different. In fact, many food critics say "Bachi Burger" might just be the best gourmet burger spot in Vegas (which is a pretty bold statement considering all the burger joints on the Strip backed by famous chefs). . . Burger "connoisseurs" unwilling to experiment any further than some avocado or pepper jack, however, might be scared off by this menu. For instance, the Ronin Burger features Angus beef, carmelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, Miso-Goma dressing, fried egg, Katsu BBQ, and Yuzu citrus aioli. The Banh-Mi Burger includes Angus beef, pork, shrimp, lemongrass pork pate, fresh herbs, curry aioli, pickled vegetables, and Nuoc Mam sauce.. . Don't be intimidated, though -- there are other options for those with simpler tastes and you can always build your own burger by starting off with an Angus patty or Wagyu patty and adding ingredients from there. Fried onion rings, applewood bacon, grilled onions, cheddar cheese, etc can all be added to any patty for $1.50 each.. . There are also a variety of different sandwiches to choose from and I could honestly fill up on the fries alone. The oxtail chili cheese fries with garlic aioli and fried egg are extremely popular, but the more traditional fries are also a big hit -- mainly because of the savory sauces that accompany them. The garlic chili aioli, Yuzu citrus aioli, sundried tomato aioli and pineapple ketchup are all HIGHLY recommended for dipping or drowning the fries of your choice (the options are regular, garlic, sweet potato, and truffle Parmesan).. . If you're not much of an adventurous diner, you'll probably stay away from Bachi Burger. Your taste buds will definitely be missing out, though.
Best burgers in Vegas! The buns are super soft and the unique asian style flavor combinations are to die for. I've been here numerous time and have never had a bad experience.  I also try a different burger on every visit and have not been let down once.  . . The burgers are large and very filling but I say splurge and get yourself an order of the oxtail chili cheese fries as well because they are amazing!
I never write reviews... ever! This place was awesome! my absolute favorite burger! Fries are outrageous. Staff is awesome. And those soft as hell buns!!! Pair that with the awesome combinations of ingredients with wagyu beef! My only complaint is that I live in phx and not vegas! Bachi in Phx Please!!! :) Screw the places on the strip this place is where its at!!!
Truffle fries were excellent.  You can pass on the duck and pork belly buns.  The iced tea was terrible, boba was not good.  Miagi burger was really good.  Cooked perfectly, juicy and tangy.  It was a little oily though but still good.
I must admit, one of the best burgers i've had! Also a must try, pork belly steamed bun! Everything was amazing... Truffle fries & oxtail chili fries! Added plus was the great service we had from Ashley. Definitely stop by this place!
Worst service I've ever gotten. McDonald's has better manners than the girl serving us. It took a minute to get our food which she couldn't get right. And who fills my sprite with water? I'll never go back. This place went to garbage quick.
This place serves by far the best burgers I have ever had!  The service, ambiance, presentation of food is immaculate.... It is not a loungy type of restaurant where you can hang out for a long time, the turn around time is fast and it feels more like a bistro.  Even though there is an outside sitting area, but it defeats the purpose in the 100 F weather.  So I would say the restaurant is more enjoyable on the off night, when you dont have to sit too close to other people and have the time to chew your burger.  LOL Prices are very reasonalble for the amount of food you get.  Totally a must visit!
Worst service ever including very rude hostess. We were told we could sit at the bar & we were looking at a 25-30 minute wait. Then at the bar several people were eating but we were told we couldn't because there was 2 of us!!! Only parties of 1. Not even an appetizer for the long wait which ended up being an hour wait. Then upon finally being seated we were told there's an hour backup on food. After placing order & waiting on empty glasses of water, the server let us know he couldn't run my card because machines were down. We had to sit there an extra 25 minutes after eating for them to finally run my card. It's clear they don't care about their customers. I used to go here all the time but after the last few times of very poor & unfriendly service, I'll be going to Skinnyfats or Burger Bar at Mandalay for a much better burger & service.
Ehhh this place is good but I prefer the Sahara and Fort Apache location. It's such a small place.
We attempted Bachi Burger after watching the World Cup today. It was pretty busy and we were a tad cranky from the 116 degree heat out.  We were seated pretty quick despite the crowd near the entrance.  We shared the Spicy Miso Burger and the truffle fries.  It was a lot of food!  The burger was cooked perfectly medium rare (this is a lot to ask for at other places), the bun was delightfully light and fluffy.  It was at least a 3 napkin job due to the sauce and egg.  The truffle fries were good, but I think we would skip them for regular fries or garlic fries.  They used a truffle gravy.  I think a truffle salt or oil would be tastier.  Overall, the food transformed our moods and the staff was nice and attentive.
STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND GRAB A BURGER HERE.. . I had the Mr. Miyagi burger. WOW. just WOW. the toppings, the beef, everything was just divine. One of the best burgers of my life.
We decided to check out Bachi Burgers while visiting friends in Vegas.  First the good stuff.  The service was great, quick and friendly.  Our server also advised us to put our orders in ahead of a larger party which helped is get our food sooner.  The food was mix.  We ordered the sausages and Peking duck steam buns as appetizers.  Both were delicious.  The oxtail chili fries were greasy and salty.  A big let down! We also ordered 3 burgers.  They were over cooked and too sweet.  The plantation teas was way too sweet.  We may give Bachi a second try next time with are in Vegas.  For now, Bachi gets an "average" Rating.
Everything about this place is amazing....the food is spot on... Great service... Will  be back...great job
The hype is medium. Just like my burger. The 1 hour+ lines are normal, and make sure you realize it's 13 mins off the strip and there are 2 locations.. . The oxtail fries were 'good.' Most people live and die by these (and the truffle fries I didn't try), but I thought the oxtail was too much chili like and not tender shreds of tail like. The fried egg on top of fries is definitely amazing.. . The burgers are hit and miss:. Ronin burger - reminded me of eating sushi rolls in a burger. Tons of great miso glaze, a fried egg, carmelized onion, multiple BBQ and other glazes. Delish. Worth $11.. . Kiki burger - great use of 3 types of asian mushrooms, grueye cheese and sauce. Worth $11.. . Miyagi-san grass fed Wagyu burger - very average. Didn't taste amazing. Tasted like a regular burger. Not worth $14.. . Shogun burger - wagyu beef with foie gras. Didn't taste anything special at all. Definitely not worth $26, even with asian pear, miso butter and asian peaches inside. Skip it.. . 3.5 stars overall. The taste is very good, but it's not as amazing and not worth an hour-2 hour wait in my opinion. Definitely give it a try though.
As my first official yelp review, Bachi Burger definitely earns the privilege of being the "first"! . . We went for to Bachi Burger during the lunch rush house madness however I only waited about less than 10 minutes to get seated. I went ahead and ordered for my bf as he always gets a usual burger (ketchup and mustard only) regardless of where he is eating. I ordered a protein style medium well with avocado burger. . . I would hands down say this has been the best protein burger I've ever had. I was a bit skeptical about order a protein burger as I didn't not maybe reviews on me. But I was definitely not disappointed. Great Asian infused flavor. I also ordered the aioli fries and he got regular fries. bomb.com !. My bf was very satisfied with his "plain" burger, and he's definitely the pickier one. He always a says that a "good burger doesn't need so many ingredients". He even filled out the survey! . . Overall great place. It might be a bit more pricier, but you get what you pay for! Did I mention that they automatically gave us military discount without asking. (He came in uniform) from work. Good customer service and great food! Must try :)
We visited Bachi Burger because it was recommended by friends.  I ordered their No meat here burger which was a Shitake mushroom Patty topped with eggplant, mixed greens and tofu.  It was very hearty, I did not miss the meat!  The sandwich was so huge that I had to use a fork and knife to eat it.  The bun was the best bun i've every had with a burger, wish I could have taken a dozen home with me.  We also ordered the truffle fries and I tasted my friends Ox tail chili cheese fries which was unreal!  My husband had a Angus burger which he will talk about in his own review.  There are many other menu items that i'd like to try.  Going back there again the next time I visit Las Vegas.
Oxtail chili fries ftw. The truffle fries are not very truffle-y. Had better at I Love Burger, Gordon Ramsay Burgr, and Guy Fieri's. They're covered in a mushroom sauce that's tasty, but I'd call them creamy mushroom fries, not truffle fries.
On the food network I saw a promo for a hamburger called Bahn Mi burger, the burger looked so damn good that I wrote down the info and even took a screen shot of the note.  This past weekend while in Vegas I decided to head down there to give it a try. Omg! This place is legit, I actually ended up ordering the Ronin burger and truffle Parmesan fries and a 1/4 of my wife's Kiki burger, also so good! Lastly, we ordered the souffle which was more like a lava cake with vanilla ice cream but so damn good too. Only bad part was the 25 minute wait for the souffle; but all in all, I needed to be pallet jacked out of there cz I was so full. Definitely coming back!
Not completely sold. I saw this place on the Foodnetwork and thought it looked really good. i had driven past it a few times and just never made it in until now. . I came on a Thursday night and it was not too crowded and we were able to sit at the bar with really no wait time. We started with beer which was actually well priced and ordered 2 burgers and an order of sweet potato fries. We had the Kiki burger and the Mr. Ho burger. the fries were actually amazing and the sauce perfectly suited. The burgers however were not great, nor even really all that good. They were immensely salty and the mish mash of flavors did not work right together, they sounded good on paper but they lacked finesse and were really just redolent of salt not flavor. The burgers were cooked perfectly though and that is a plus.. I really wanted to like this place and it really started to fill up as we left but there are certainly better options in Vegas where you can skip this place and hit the next gourmet burger shop. You won't miss anything by not coming here.
Amazing burgers.  The quality of the ingredients and how it comes together, makes a very good burger. Oxtail fries is very good too.
This place consistently lied to me about wait times and never mentioned how long ordering to serving would take until we had already committed more than an hour of waiting time. . . The fact that they had tables available in their side room and patio that they didn't have enough servers for was astonishing. Bad business practices. And being told it would take 40 minutes for food to be served after we had already waited an hour was very upsetting.. . Go to this place at your own risk, I will warn you in case they don't.
Saw Bachi featured on DDD one night and was so happy to find out that it was located less than a mile away from my house in Las Vegas. . . I've tried a few of the burgers. My favorite is the kalbi burger. I love the marinade and the kimchee and spicy mayo they use. I could smell this marinated beef patty from outside. In loooove with the oxtail chili cheese fries! Every time I bring someone here, that's a hit. Went one time and finally got to try the pork belly buns, but unfortunately the pork belly was cold when we got it, kind of congealed already. My family eats a lot of pork belly and being Chinese, I'm familiar with similar dishes. My friend and I were highly disappointed. I love their strawberry jasmine lemonade! So good ESP in the LV heat. Never seen the combo anywhere else. . . They also opened a ramen house next door. You can order from both menus. I'll be back to try the ramen (but probably not until the winter) and to give those pork belly buns another try.
Great burgers!!  Come early as the placed is packed.  Well worth the wait. Good stuff!!!!
Kinda hidden on far end of strip mall, but sign on side of the building helps.  Excellent burgers and truffle parm fries.  Service staff is fast and friendly.  My wife really liked the lychee boba drink.  Lots of TVs -- good to watch some sports while enjoying fantastic food.  Enjoyed the Spicy Miso and Banh-Mi burgers.  Taro bun on the Mr. Ho's burger was a little different for my taste.  Excellent restaurant.
BURGER LUV. . I've been coming here since Lorin Watada opened Bachi Burger, and I haven't discovered anyone else who can come close to replicating Bachi Burger. . . My brain stem is a hostage of his Kalbi tender sweet kimchee burger prepared medium-rare. My other crackseed brain craving is his creamy smooth Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries.. . BTW... check out my 808 friend and YELP'er Jo Y's Bachi Burger review. She does super TMZ job about Braddah Lorin Watada's path to success.
Apps were great. We had cox oxtail fries and duck bun sliders. All high quality and good flavor.  Burger was darn good as well.  Not the best ive had, but enjoyable.  Service was very good too. I would have given 4 stars but the flies were ridiculous.  We sat inside and kept swatting flies. It really took away from the experience. It also makes you question the cleanliness of the operation. This is Vegas and indoors, flies should never be this bad.
Have been here 2 times... Both times were great. The restaurant has very long wait times. My first attempt to go here I was to hungry to wait- second time I called ahead (5-10 min wait) but by the time I got there it was 25 min wait... it was worth it. I had onion ring app, the shogun burger and truffle fries. The second time I ordered to go- the veggie burger and a salad... the burger had a really thick slice of eggplant that was too much for me, but great otherwise. Will return and recommend
Been to bachi and shoku a few times I like that they are one entity. The added bar is a very nice touch. Our server Dan was excellent and knew the menu very well and had some great suggestions. I was able to order from both menus which was a bonus. My oxtail chili cheese fries and octopus pancakes as apps were outstanding. My ramen was to die for. We enjoyed our food soooooo much I had to ask our server for the name of the chef. Chef Don was on point with all our dishes. Thanks Bachi and Shoku we will definitely see you soon
It's been almost two years and too many visits. Just kidding, you can't make too many visits here. Anyway, time for an update!. . Bachi Burger is a fantastic burger place that I always recommend to friends and family, locals and visitors alike. The specialty burgers are obviously what you want to get, but don't turn a blind eye to appetizers and fries.. . I've enjoyed the kurobuta and aribaki sausage w/ honey mustard, chili fried chicken, oxtail chili cheese fries, and the sweet potato fries before. However, my favorite side is definitely the truffle parmesan fries with parmigiano reggiano, white truffle oil (shut up, I know it's not real truffle), porcini cream, and sundried tomato aioli. I don't tend to have it while I'm in the middle of a Bachi burger, so I usually try to get them to bring it out earlier than the burgers.. . I will detail all the burgers that I've eaten in reverse power rankings style:. . 7) "Banh-mi" Burger. Brownie points for the quotation marks. I always enjoy a good banh mi, but I am not a fan of this burger, and it still saddens me that this is the one that they chose to feature on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. The flavors just don't work or harmonize together for some reason, and I always steer people away from this.. . 6) Mr. Ho's. The highlight is probably lup cheong, a sweet pinkish red pork sausage. The problem is that the overall flavor profile is too sweet and only has that one flavor. Glad I've tried it, glad I'll never have to order it again.. . 5) Spicy miso. I had this tied with Kiki's before, but I've gotta make a choice. Nothing especially wrong here, and really love the fried egg. Heat seekers, do know that the sauce isn't that spicy, even for someone with a delicate palate like me. If I had a rotation, this would make my rotation.. . 4) Kiki's. My old second favorite burger. Bacon, lots of mushrooms, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli. Sweet overall but not too sweet, and a good layering of flavors.. . 3) Miyagi-san's grass-fed wagyu. Relatively simple combination here to accompany the default "wagyu" patty. Chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings. It's really weird though, since I specifically taking a bite, not enjoying it, then flipping my burger upside down and really loving it. I guess the flavors hit my mouth a lot better that way. Try it both ways and see for yourself.. . By the way, I couldn't really distinguish wagyu from the normal angus beef, so you're likely better off not "upgrading" any of your other specialty burgers.. . 2) Manga. My burger from today. This was a special posted on the chalkboard outside. It is a 7 oz patty with sunny side up egg (presented without top bun not layered), sprouts, crab and scallop dynamite, and a side of pickled ginger. Apparently, enoki mushrooms also were in it, but I don't recall. Anyway, if you're a fan of dynamite, you need to eat this. The egg contributes as usual, the dynamite flavor is all there (most tender baby scallops I've ever had, by the way), the beef flavor is always there, and the pickled ginger can add extra sweetness if you so desire. I couldn't decide whether I enjoy it more with or without ginger.. . 1) Ronin. Still my favorite, although the manga made a really, really strong case. I think the yuzu citrus aioli adds enough acidity that it pushes the Ronin above a very strong field of contenders. Caramelized onions, Japanese coleslaw, miso goma dressing, and my beloved fried egg complete the flavor combination.. . All burgers really should be enjoyed medium-rare. It's cooked, but you still get that nice pinkish center and keep all the juiciness. If you order it well-done, I will personally hunt you down and even haunt your dreams if I must. They have always delivered the right temperature and never gotten me sick, so don't under or over-order.. . Some don't believe that it's the best burger in town. I haven't eaten everywhere in Vegas yet, but this is still my favorite place, even in spite of the recent menu-wide price hike. I will also note that some guy who writes a blog solely about Vegas burgers has apparently been almost everywhere, and he's named Bachi as his favorite. You will have to see for yourself, and I hope you manage to go early or late enough to avoid the ubiquitous crowds.
The Hype is real! Hate the wait but when you want something unique when visiting vegas a little wait makes your trip a lot better. Recommend OX Tail Fries, onion rings, and any of their burgers
I wasn't impressed.  The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries was very good but the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger and Ronin burger were not.  Both burgers were relatively tasteless and whatever taste was there was interesting.. . It is definitely not worth a taxi ride from the strip.
We had the Kiki burger, the sausage appetizer, and a well-paired Hitachino ale.  Friendly, upbeat service.
I made my pilgrimage twice in one weekend while visiting Las Vegas. Friday night, 10pm, there was still a 25 minute wait-- a testament to how good this place is! I scored a single spot at the bar right away- the advantage of traveling solo. . . I had the steamed bun with pork belly and truffled fries, both excellent. If I had to nit pick, I'd say the truffle gravy is a bit strange, and the pink dipping sauce along side is a distraction. Possibly consider moving the truffle gravy to the dipping sauce location and just toss those crispy thin fries with truffle oil.. . Sunday, on my way out of Vegas, they were not serving at the bar, so I waited 35 minutes for my one-top table. Service was fast and efficient. I had my old favorite, the banh mi burger and their onion rings- which are amazing. Thinly sliced and tempura battered- perfectly crisp. . . This is a don't miss spot- although you need to plan for a wait, it's well worth it!
This is a good casual place to eat a quick lunch or dinner with friends. Decor is nice inside and the waiters are very attentive, I never had to ask for a refill of water.. . As others have mentioned, the oxtail chili cheese fries are a must. Don't underestimate the portion, it's a huge plate of fries slathered with yummy oxtail sauce goodness with melted cheese and beans. I usually share it with 2 other friends and we are all basically half full before our burgers even arrive.. . In terms of the burgers, they have interesting options here but nothing stands out to me that much, though they also have big portions (compared to Umami). Overall a unique restaurant with good price and service
Service: 3. Food: after having it the first time I rated it a 5. Now after the second time it's 3.5-4 . . We came here on a sat night knowing there will be a wait. We put our names down and was told that for a party of 5 it's going to be 30-45 min wait. Exactly 30 mins later we checked back in and it seems like they have already crossed our names out (we weren't waiting outside of the restaurant we walked around).  We were told that unfortunately they would have to rewrite our names on the bottom of their list again since we left the area. I personally have never heard of that rule or ever been to any restaurant that practices that so I tried reasoning with the hostess. Long story short turns out that they could "make something happen" and that there's another party just leaving and we will get seated right after. Our waitress was really nice and did a good job at recommending different menu items but she didn't check back in with us very often to see how things are going and if we needed anything. . . I remembered the burgers being amazing the first time I tried them. However this time not so much, my burger tasted a lot more saltier than I remembered and to my liking. We got the truffle fries and a side of pineapple ketchup. I mean I LOVE pineapple so I just HAD to try it. It taste just like ketchup that's a little on the sweeter side but other than that I don't taste anything different. I'm guessing it's just ketchup mixed with pineapple juice but who knows! I got the "banh mi" burger and the bf got the Ronin Burger. Banh mi burger...like I mentioned was pretty salty, but I think that might be because the pickled carrot was not made correctly. I tasted the carrot on its own and it was extreme salty and nasty so I had to take it out of my burger. Other than that little hiccup..everything was wonderful. The bf loved his burger I mean you can't go wrong with a juicy patty and fried egg! OH did I mention their flavored soda is ammmaazzingggg! I've tried the apple lychee, the peach one, as well as orange tangerine and every single one is great!  . . Overall experience was great. Def will be back again.
I finally got to try this place on Friday after spending an evening at the Auto Mall and this appeared to be the only thing open that was on the way home besides fast food. I was excited to try it but mehhh - way overhyped and not worth the steep amounts they're charging for fusion burgers and fries.. . Rachel and I had a kalbi burger ($11), oxtail fries ($11.50) and a side salad ($5). The food was decent and had very nice presentation but still this isn't a fancy restaurant and just because you make it look like Gordon Ramsay's BurGR, I suddenly have to pay prices upwards of 20 bucks? I got the kalbi burger because it was one of the more affordable options and sounded good. It is basically a regular beef burger with Korean BBQ style sauce drizzled on the patty and some kimchi that didn't have much taste. Nothing special. If I had some Korean BBQ sauce, I too could make this exact burger at home. The oxtail fries were good but nothing more than some chopped beef and a sunny side egg on top of some cheese fries. It was good but not worth the $11.50 price point which cost more than my burger WTF.. . Service was decent and we kept getting water refills without having to ask. There are certainly some characters working here and Rachel and I both had some good laughs at the staff's expense. Inside jokes so y'all needn't worry about it haha
Is it? Is it the best burger in Las Vegas? On the strip, you are definitely not going to find the best burger in Las Vegas. Trust me. I tried looking -- this means I spent a lot of cash paying for subpar burgers. Luckily, just before you hit Vegas on the 15, exiting East Windmill Lane, you have Bachi Burger. The Asian inspired burger joint was showcased on Diners, Drive-In, and Dives, and I immediately made plans for a Vegas trip -- I made it my first stop.. . We started things off with the oxtail chili cheese fries. Most times, chili cheese fries or poutine has fries that are left soggy from the sauce. I liked how the fries were still intact and crisp. The ox tail was tender and was almost chili like -- cooking for hours helped make it into a mush of things. The garlic aioli and fried egg made everything so creamy and smooth. I liked the edition of the cilantro. It gave the dish such a freshness and helped with the richness of the oxtail. With the help of the jalapenos which were quite spicy, the dish was complete.. . Though the oxtail fries were good, we all came here for the burger. Morse specifically, I came here for the Ronin burger. This burger had angus beef, caramelized onions, jalapenos, coleslaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, and yuzu citrus aioli. I know that seems like a lot of ingredients, but all of the flavors worked. I am a firm believer that a good burger has to have gooey melted cheese or a strong cheese presence -- cheese is always a must. I was surprised that this Asian inspired burger, with no cheese was so delicious. The beef patty was cooked perfectly medium rare with a nice crust and pink in the middle. The spicy jalapenos and the sweet bbq and citric aioli all bounced around and filled my mouth with flavor. If you were to get one burger at Bachi, this is the one to get.. . Not feeling like another burger, we decided on the pork belly steamed buns. Filled with an irresistable duroc pork belly, the meat was cut thick. The skin and fat on the pork melted in your mouth and created such an unctuous flavor. The boiled egg added more richness to the steam bun. The cilantro, scallions, and radish helped balance the rich fatty pork belly. Interestingly, the chinese black vinegarrete and hoisin bbq sauce gave the salty and sweet flavor of the mini sandwich.. . As a dessert, and to send us off in a proper manner, we ordered the malasadas. To me, the Portuguese fried donut balls were out of place. To go along with the Asian style burgers, they should have an Asian style dessert. To me, the fried donut balls were a bit stale and not "melt in your mouth" enough. With the help of the delicious coffee gelato though, the dessert was passable. I wouldn't have minded if it were just the coffee gelato by itself.. . Bachi Burger is a Las Vegas pit stop for sure. Next time, I will have to give the decadent Shogun Burger a try. That one has foie gras and is $25. Though not on the strip, it is a perfect spot to eat for lunch on the way in or on the way out of Las Vegas. Even if you want to kind of step away from the busy strip, it's not far of a drive to go to Bachi Burger. The inside has all tables and no booths. You just find a seat, grab a beer, maybe a nice sake to compliment your burger, and have an awesome meal.. . For those who are in Los Angeles, well, Bachi Burger is coming! It will be in West LA, on Sawtelle. Not quite sure when it will open, but I will keep an eye out for you.
AMAZING BURGERS! I love the bun the use soft and fluffy. I made sure to come just when they opened, so there was no wait time. Although when i finished and left, there was a huge crowd outside waiting to be seated.. . . Miyagi-san Burger; Amazing burger! perfect combination of Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings. Has a unique Japanese taste. Reminds me of eating specialty rolls at sushi places.. . Kiki's Burger: Perfect combination of mushroom that gives the burger a unique taste. Hard to decide whether i like this more or the Miyagi burger. I would say if you want something less guilty... get this one! It was great, but not too heavy.. . Truffle Parmesan Fries - Unique taste I would get this again. Prefer this over the Oxtail Chili cheese fries. . Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries- Pretty interesting to try once, but i would skip this and try an extra burger next time!
I'm only giving this place 4 stars because their burgers are expensive, but I guess that's what you pay for quality burgers.  Their oxtail chilli cheese fries are to die for!  They have a great selection of fries too.  Very unique burger joint.
Admittedly being a newbie to fancy schmancy fusion burger spots Bachi really blew my mind.  It was packed but we got seated in less than 10 minutes.  The service was very friendly and the place looks cool.  As far as the burgers, they were a knock out for me!  . . I had the Bahn Mi.  It was a straight out pho style burger with pickled carrot, veggies, jalapeno and fresh lush basil.  You dip this one in sweet pho sauce.  Very good.  4/5. . There was the KiKi which had mushrooms bacon and looked good.  This was lil'bro's so I didn't try it.. . The best one was the Miyagi burger.  With fried onions, fried egg a chimichuri/dijon sauce and a wagyu burger.  My it was a masterpiece of a burger. 5/5. . The Truffle Fries had a Vietnamese type of truffle peanut butter drizzle and a straight garlic truffle drizzle between.  With a special aioli. It could only be better with actual truffle specks. 4.5/5. . All the burgers were on a bun similar to a larger soft sticky bun.  Service and food make this worthy of 5 stars for me.
