Margaritaville las vegas...what can I say. Their menu is creative and fun. The dishes are served hot and fresh and while some may not expect great food I feel most would be pleased. The real treat here is the atmosphere.  Just an all around fun place to be with lots of entertainment: whether the on site entertainers, the wait staff or your fellow diners. The key word is fun. In a city where most are working in hospitality to make a buck the staff here seem to enjoy their jobs but honestly you will find that all over vegas. Margaritaville serves a good time with great tasting food and an experience you are unlikely to forget. The best experience is to go with friends but my wife and a I went last night and had a blast. We may just pop in for the volcano nachos!....probably mentioned in other reviews so I won't be Labour the point...but I will let you know if we managed to finish them!
Good service. Had the Lava Nachos with the wife. The plate is huge and could possibly feed a small family of 4. We couldn't finish it. Service was good. Pretty loud with live music. We also got a margarita and we were expecting more than the Solo cup-sized drink we got - disappointed considering the massive margaritas available everywhere else.
Disappointed!. Its the 4th of July and we had repurchased 8 seats together at a table on the balcony to watch the fireworks. We were sent wristbands and a confirmation. We arrived before dark and... Our table was given away! Did I mention my son and now daughter in-law  had there wedding this morning. . Such a hassle, they made accommodations by settings up a table in a weird place and smiling a lot but really the mood was off. . Memories last a lifetime and I was hoping this would of been a good one.
I just have one word to say... "Expensive!" Food isn't that great, service is good and their Saturday night band is pretty good also.
Still awesome! The daytime band was amazing and we had a great time! The nachos again were too much food and so so good! I can't wait totry and get back here every weekend! We love the food, beer, and atmosphere!
I can't knock it for anything.  My fish tacos where awesome and the decor is cool and nautical.  Our waitress Tabitha was attentive, on point, and friendly.  The music was great and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I highly recommend eating here or just having a drink to soak in the atmosphere.  Soooo COOL!
Horrible experience!!! We went in around 11pm, when they were only serving their late night menu. We were told to seat ourselves, so we headed to a table right in the middle of the restaurant, next to, two other full tables.. . We waited 15 minutes, no one came to our table, we watched 3 other servers walk by. After having to go ask someone up front to get our server, finally our server came by and got our order.. with no apology for the wait.. . We ordered a burger and wings. Our burger came out wrong. Our server never came back to check on us.. so we pushed the burger to the edge of the table. Finally another 20 minutes later, he came by and asked how things were... . After we told him everything that we were mad about, he never apologized or asked if he could do anything to fix it. Just said he would comp our bill, and walked away!!!
Great place, great atmosphere, decent service. A good place to enjoy decent food, good drinks and a great time in general, the wait wasn't too long, they entertained the patrons, they had a lady making balloon animals for the kids, just a great family fun experience.
It isn't horrible, and the open air is nice.  The food is standard.  We came here for Caribbean music and conch fritters and they had neither.  They had old guy rock and lots of carby foods that just aren't my taste.  . . The unionized waiters wearing their commie looking union pins were distraction from the laid back, beach feel I had hoped for.  . . Won't be back.  But it wasn't tragic.  Just a general waste of a night in Vegas.
The margaritas were awful!! Tasted like all sugar and no alcohol. They charged $11 for essentially a non alcoholic margarita. They had like 4 dinner items on their menu so don't come here trying to eat dinner. Server was rude when we asked if they could add more alcohol since it was to sugary to even drink. They get 1 star because there was live music.
I have dined at Margaritaville twice now since I have gone to Vegas, and each time gets better. My only complain is that on Thursday night when my husband and I went all they were serving was burgers, being Vegan this was just not going to work. I can work with Vegetarian options but in this case I had no choice. Boo, that sucked. But we did return and I am glad we did! On Sunday afternoon, my husband and I head toeat around 3pm we were seated right away and within the minute the server came to get our drinks. She recommend a Peach & Raspberry Margarita in the Souvenir Blender which we went ahead and got. It was SO good! Highly highly recommend, it is not on the Menu but it should be! I got the Veggie Burger with Fries and my husband got a steak with shrimp. The food was super super good! It was totally worth going back, after my minor upset days before. Another plus was they had a live band! The music was nice, and my son started dancing in his high chair. The manager came over and asked if she could take him on stage! We agreed, and she walked him up the stage and he had his dance with the singer/guitarist. It was really nice. As always I love Margaritaville it is a must go when you go to Vegas the customer service is great the whole staff was friendly and made the experience great. The food is super good, and the drinks are amazing. Having live music is such a plus, it is nice they play music any way but live music makes it better. I also love the decor very very under the sea type of atmosphere. A must go! Highly recommend :D
Atmosphere is fun and inviting. Was very busy when I went and was seated in 20 min. Great service, great energy. This place does NOT skimp on the drinks. Had one drink an was feelin it. Service was good but could be faster. That's why it gets 4 stars. But entertainment was fun and music keeps the restaurant together it feels like.good playlist. Will be back here!
Short version: long wait, mediocre food, good service, overly sweet margaritas, and a band that were so loud conversation was impossible.  If you're here for a bachelor party where you're happy to get drunk and scream yourself hoarse, then it's probably fine... but not my idea of a good dining experience.
Boy, I REALLY wanted to like this place... But what a shitty experience! . . We were seated quickly, which was expected because it was a late Sunday night and there was only 3 of us. I know it's Vegas, but it wasn't poppin' or anything. We were seated by the window, which normally would be fine, but the AC was on full blast directly at us. It was nice for about 2 minutes, then we were all freezing.. . We waited 10 minutes before seeing our waiter, which shouldn't have happened seeing as they were slow (and not understaffed). We ordered waters and said we'd need just another minute with the menus. About 5 minutes later, our waiter brought the waters. At this time, we asked to move to a table not under the AC. He pointed to a table and said once it was clean, we could move over there, and he walked away. A few minutes later, we moved ourselves over. . . It took 15 minutes before our new waiter stopped by. Again, not okay. We ordered dinner and an appetizer. The appetizer came promptly, and we were told the food would take about 30 minutes because I had ordered a steak (cooked well), which is understandable.. . Finally we got our food, over 45 MINUTES later. I went to take my first bite of mashed potatoes and just about lost my appetite.... I FOUND A HAIR. Gross. . . At this point, my mom was pissed. She asked to see the manager. He came over and was very kind (wish I would have gotten his name). He apologized multiple times and said he'd have the kitchen rush me a new one (after making sure that's what I'd like to happen). 20 minutes later, I got a new steak and sides. (Funnyhow it came twice as fast that time....) . . I was super disappointed, though. The steak was not good. I know Margaritaville isn't a steakhouse, but for $26.99 you'd think they could cook a decent New York Strip. . . The ONLY redeeming factor at this place was the manager. He even took my dish off of the bill. . . Definitely don't recommend going and won't be back! Bummer!
Meh. Nachos and wings were okay. Had a virgin margarita which was good. Quesadillas were average. The atmosphere is fun though!
We had a lot of fun at this restaurant. The food was great, our waiter was very nice and the restaurant had a lot of theme going on to make it stand out. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.
As a major Parrothead I love coming to Vegas as it's usually for a concert.  A large venue that's well done, even better with the new stret bar allowing breeze and more views.  Staff are friendly and provide a good time with the same menu standard across the chain.. . You can never go wrong with the Cheeseburger, of course, but there are a lot of great other options.  Shrimp, ahi, nachos, are all quite nice.  The fajitas are not that great, but that's okay.  It's really the experience you are there for in the first place.. . I always recommend the "Perfect Margarita", why waste time, it's Perfect!
So we went here twice on our recent visit.  First time was for lunch.  The waiter was super knowledgeable about gluten free offerings.  He even knew which flavor margarita's were gluten free!   This was a fantastic experience.  It was also mid day on a weekday.  Our second trip was for dinner on a Thursday.  This was a completely different experience all together.  We sat at the bar to avoid a long wait for a table.  Our server took our order and brought us drinks and then vanished on his break.  We saw runners bring food out and not able to figure out who's it was.  They then asked the bartender and he put the food on his back shelf and there it sat...I don't know how long b/c it was still there when we left.  Our food took FOREVER to come out.   When it did, it was a cold mushy mess.   SO my advice is skip it for dinner, but definitely do lunch here.
It's 5 o'clock somewhere...  . . Margaritaville is conveniently located on the corner of the the strip and the walk going back to the Linq area.  We stopped in here to grab a bite before a show.  The hostess was less than thrilled to seat us...  but at least that is where the bad service ended.. . Clarissa was our waitress and was awesome!  She took great care of us always making sure out drinks were filled, made some small talk and had our food out in a snap!  She was very informative about the locals discounts in the Linq area.  Like I said, she was great!. . We decided to split the volcano burger.  It was topped with volcano chili, jalapenos, fritos and cheese.  It was just ok.   The burger was overcooked to our liking.  Surprising it was a little dry even with all of the toppings smothering it.  Fries were good and crisp.   I was glad that we split this meal because it was more than enough food.   Did I mention we started with the pretzels and cheese?  Maybe that's why I was so full.  The pretzels were soft and delicious.  I wouldn't mind getting them again.  . . This was just one of the places I've been wanting to try.  Food is ok and thanks to Clarissa, the service was great!
Alright service, but tasty snacks can't make review on meals as I didn't have one but ordered beach tacos and a bucket of beer with my wife and waitress was changing shifts and I understand that but you don't have to be rude about it.
Punch me in the throat why don't you?. Twist the knife before you pull it out of my back!. This is a update of my review posted on July 6th for a questionable vist we experienced on the 4th of July.. I recived a reply from someone claiming to be the business owner, saying she was sorry and to contact her if I had any questions. Must of been bogus! We tried to contact her a couple of times with no success. They must be busy planning there next scam. If you have 100 seats, sell a 100 tickets not a 120 hoping some won't show. You made your money, beyond that is greed.. Once bitten, twice shy.
Came here with friends before a concert nearby on the Strip and my friend raved about the Volcano nachos, which were pretty tasty. Definitely a fun place to go for munchies. Not fine dining by any stretch of the means, but you're in Vegas, and it's reasonably priced for standard burgers and bar fare. Claire R. was our friendly server who was very attentive, and personable. We took advantage of sitting at a table which conveniently had an outlet right by so we could be touristy and charge our phones. While we were dining, there was a kitschy performance done by the wait staff where they clapped and sang so that it was like a mini tropical Parrothead production complete with a "mermaid" sliding from the top of the bar into a pool of water. Like others have mentioned, you're paying for the fun atmosphere and experience. There is a gift ship and casino attached to the restaurant where you can continue your Margaritaville experience after you finish eating.
Really loved the tropical fruit frozen margarita but the best part of this place was the great attitude of the bartenders. They were super friendly and constantly did balancing and juggling acts to prepare your drink.
This bar is awesome because of Kevin and Billy! They are amazing!  We came here for an afternoon drink on an anniversary trip to Vegas.  My girlfriend and I came here while our guys were dune buggy riding.  We had a blast!  They were entertaining and super nice!
Try the Volcano Nachos, no really, they're the second best nachos in town. The perfect Margaritas are some of the best Margaritas in town. You'll pay for it but hey it's good 'ol Vegas Strip fun. . . Sure Margaritaville is cheesy, but so what!! It feels good to be cheesy now and then. This can be said about a lot of Strip places and this and Toby Keith's at Harrah's are perfect examples. Just because you live in a tourist town doesn't mean you can't go to tourist places. For God's sake, we assume people that live in Hawaii go to the beach. So we're going to the strip and places like this and we're having as much fun as everyone else.
Great atmosphere and tons of fun for the whole family. Every hour or so they do a little show that ends with a girl sliding down the volcano into a huge margarita glass. Not to mention their house margaritas are fabulous. You should try to sit in one of the boats, that is super fun. . . We started off with Asiago Crab Dip and substituted chips instead of bread, we all loved the taste and texture. Then I chose the Carne Asada Steak tacos for dinner. They had pico de gallo, cheese and cilantro on them. I ate every bite... So yummy! I tasted a few different items that my family choose and my favorite was the Seafood Mac and Cheese. Wow, simply divine! . . The service is adequate for a restaurant of this size and all the entertainment going on around you. Just prepare to wait a bit and enjoy the surroundings. The food will not disappoint you and just keep the drinks coming. Who doesn't like Jimmy Buffet? He is a legend and his restaurant will amaze you.
We came here every time we came to vegas when I was a kid. Now as an adult who lives in Vegas, I still love it. Service is always good, food is great (portions could be bigger..) . . Atmosphere is amazing, very entertaining, especially when there is a live band!
The place was good and the food was tasty.. However,. The table and the chair and the floor under the table was dirty.. My medium done meat was grilled as a well done.. All these things are not big of an issue for me. But when it came to the wine, the second bottle if wine was served opened, which made me doubt. So I tasted it and made two of my friends taste my glass from the first bottle and compare it with the second bottle "supposedly similar bottle" and it was clearly not the same. And. The second bottle had a lighter taste than the first one.. I didn't complain about it as I had a friend who didn't want me to complain, so here I am writing my review.. I would never accept someone to fool me, but that waiter did.
