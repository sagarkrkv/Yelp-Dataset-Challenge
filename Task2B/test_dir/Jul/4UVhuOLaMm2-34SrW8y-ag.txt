Received at least 38 demerits after inspection by the Southern Nevada Health District.  see the following article fordetails --http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2014/07/03/japanese-favorite-ichiza-shut-down-by-snhd.php
I love coming to place. If you wanna come to someplace where you wanna be seen, you have come to the right place. They have menus on the wall as well as the menus that they hand out to you when you are being seated. The ambiance is great with the busy-ness of the waitresses seating people and taking orders, to the cooks  clanging kitchen utensils as they are preparing your next meal, the loud chattering of the people. Sounds like music to my ears. . . This is one the first places that my husband had taken me out when we were dating. (awwee! :-) ). Since, I am a big fan of sashimi I always start out with the tofu salad with tuna sashimi. This is a great dish!  and a large order of their sashimi platter. My husband orders half a bowl of ramen with vegetables. We normally finish off our meal with sapporro and for desert honey toast.
Good ramen. Expect a little wait.
It doesn't get more authentic Japanese than Ichiza. I've been going to Ichiza for over 5+ years and two things remain constant:. 1. during rush times, there is a long wait. 2. the food is always delicious.. . Try the sweet corn which is an appetizer of  creamy, cheesy corn kernels on top of a crispy chip. Other favorites: baby bok choy, jalapeno fried rice, kimchi, ika (squid), shrimp tempura bowl, salmon sashimi, salmon onigiri, and everyone's favorite honey toast!. . I was sad to hear it was closed by the snh (http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2014/07/03/japanese-favorite-ichiza-shut-down-by-snhd.php) and I was saddened even more to hear that this isn't the first time Ichiza was closed. I hope they realize that they have a lot of fans and they clean up those demerits. As a note, I've never gotten ill or sick from food at Ichiza and once they reopen, I'll be back!
No doubt this place has exceptional service and awesome interior decor. It's super authentic and just has pictures of delicious looking food all over! There's one wall that has pictures of the owners and employees. You can definitely tell they love what they do and enjoy doing it. The style is awesome and food is tasty. You can taste the flavors  distinctly when eating their dinners! I like their ramen. As for dessert, people have told me they have the best honey toast in town. I was super excited to try it after knowing what honey toast finally was. And to my dismay, it wasn't. It was just okay. I wouldn't get it again since I know somewhere else that has the best honey toast in town. It's not bad for the price, but I don't think it's that great. Other than that, it gets pretty busy and wait times can be long, but the food definitely worth it. Love coming here with a big group of friends and sitting in the back corner couches!
Really unique dining experience in Chinatown Las Vegas!  Really small... and can be a little slow. And you may be seated at a community table unless you want to wait longer for a private table... but... i think it's all worth it to be adventurous and try some really good new foods. Everything I've have tried here was really really good. And you MUST get the honey toast for dessert!
Ichiza was shut down by the SNHD on June 30. . http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2014/07/03/japanese-favorite-ichiza-shut-down-by-snhd.php. . Ugh. If you like to play Russian Roulette with your health, keep reading. But personally, I'd never come here again, because they don't practice basic hygiene yet they serve raw fish and raw beef. Yuck. . . The food was decent, 4 stars. It reminds me of a smaller, dirtier Honda-ya in Tustin.  They've got typical Izakaya-style items on their menu, such as sashimi, yakitori and ramen. I really enjoyed the kimchi buta and the famous honey toast. I also got the beef tataki, which was decent, but now I feel queasy that I ate it. . . . The decor isn't much. It feels like an authentic Japanese Izakaya; small, cramped, with a decent sake list and faded pieces of paper taped to the wall. . . Service was ok, it wasn't packed on a Thurs. night when we went. . . Decent place, but with the health concerns and so many other good places to eat nearby, I doubt I'll ever go back here again.
We loved this place... but the last time we dined here a few of the dishes had a taste sour.. so we turned them back. A few days later they are closed by the Southern Nevada Health District. Turns out they have been closed 8 times since 2008 for repeated violation and failed inspections. I strongly recommend you pass. Sad its a great place but serving sushi with massive disregard for safe food handling is a no go!!! Can google http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2014/07/03/japanese-favorite-ichiza-shut-down-by-snhd.php
I'm sure Ichiza is one of the most popular Japanese restaurants in LV! Many many customers LOVE this place! They have the most original and traditional Japanese food! They serve hundreds of dishes and everyone is very good! They always busy so u'd better make the reservation or you might need to wait!:)
BEWARE!. . Ichiza was shut down by the South Nevada Health Department on June 30, 2014, for the fourth time in four years.  That is unacceptable.  They were tagged with 38 demerits from 10 different violations ranging from handwashing issues to proper temperature for stored foods.  Beware, especially since they are serving uncooked food.  . . As far as the food and service goes, the okra-natto was interesting, albeit slimy (but it's supposed to be), the sushi was good and the service was good.  But if I had read about their sanitary issues, I wouldn't have gone.  You can Google it, if you want to read for yourself.
Late night bites in the form of Japanese tapas! Ichiza reminds me of a place I frequented in the Bay area, complete with hand-written specials papering the walls. Skimmed a few reviews before ordering, will com back to try more.. . BEST: . Baby bokchoy in garlic soup. The soup makes this dish, broth tastes like black garlic ramen and the fact that it's a veggie dish in a sea of fried options is also a plus. Not to mention it's a mere $4. Favorite dish of the night.. Salmon sashimi comes 5 pieces to an order, good cut, thick and fatty. May come again to try other sushi options.. . OKAY:  . Grilled ika. Had a tiny bit of a sauce, seemed a little overcooked and tough, but this is a dish I normally love. There's a place in Henderson that does it better.. Shabu Shabu Salad. Flavors are springtime fresh with fresh produce, chicken, eggplant?, and a light dressing. Good fresh option on the menu.. . SKIPPABLE:. Takoyaki. Overly breaded. Woudn't get again. Seemed undercooked.. . Service was polite, quick, and attentive. Sit at the bar to watch what goes on in the open kitchen, or sit at one of the old-school tables toward the back.
