The service is great I love that it is open to locals for free even on the Fourth of July. You can tell the water is not heated. So it lost a star for that. But I like most things about it. But some fun new drinks on the menu would be nice for sure!
Paid to see the 4th of July fireworks in the observation deck of the Tower. It was the absolute worse experience ever!! Prices were $28 per person, it was crowded, hot, no view of anything and the worst singers/performance they could hire.  So bad that the overhead speakers kept going out and all you heard was very loud static.  It got so bad that everyone was chanting "turn it off, turn it off"! Save your money and don't go here. You can see it free from the sidewalk!
This is one of the older casinos on the strip. It is barely a part of the strip. It is definitely on the more low class end of it, in not the nicest of neighborhoods. But as for the actual casino, it is really clean and nice inside. It is rarely too packed in this place so if you're looking for more of a quiet gambling experience in a nice place, this is your spot. I really like going up to the top of the tower. It's only about $20 dollars and you get a terrific 360 degree view of Las Vegas. They also have bar and restaurants up top and DJs at night. It truly is a unique experience that no other place in LV can offer.
Worse experience ever. Wait for assistant from front office for basically 20 mins and received a unpleasant answer for not having internet access in 4 hours during the day. The buffet is disgusting! Even you received it for free, i strongly recommend you rather going to McDonald than torture yourself eating there
Booked for 4th of July what a mistake $140 total. For a 1970s ish room with a lawn mower of a AC unit. A toilet with the noise of outdoor public one. A shower that had dirt still in it in clumps. And hearing people and plumbing noise all night to top it off. All because bookaroom.com deceived us with pics of the new remodeled ones which is not what we got. Resort fee jumped up an early check in at 10 dollars extra. Never will I stay here again. The only plus was with room was free tower view.
The tower! It's very cool and unique to Vegas. One thing to note from this review and it's super important: . . Don't assume this hotel is on the Strip! You can't walk to the strip from here. You can, but it's 30 mins to any major hotel and it's not exactly a walk I would feel safe taking my loved ones on! You will need a taxi to the strip OR downtown!. . The hotel itself is super nice. The rooms are remodeled and look fantastic, believe it or not! The staff is attentive and friendly. They've done a nice job putting lipstick on this pig! Just kidding. It's a nice place.
Worst hotel in Vegas!!! We made reservations before we left and drove all night to get there.  When we got there around 3, they said since we hadn't arrived by midnight our reservations were given to someone else.  They gave us a coupon for breakfast at the coffee shop (the food was not good, cold and overcooked) We went back to the check in and were told we had to wait a while longer, no rooms available!!! I asked to speak to the manager, it was about 5 am by this time.  They got him on the phone and I explained that I had a reservation that I had paid for and wanted my room right away. We are exhausted after 5 hour drive.  He told us he would have a room for us in 5 - 10 minutes.  We finally got a key and got to the room, opened the door and saw an ice chest sitting on the table, then saw 2 people in the dark, looking at us very scared.....we left immediatly and went back down to the desk and told them there were people in our room....they apologized and got us another room!!!  The second room was hideous with a view of an air conditioning unit....horrible.....we were so tired, but just couldn't rest, I called down to the desk and they said they would get us another room.  The next one had a woman inside, she was just getting out of the shower, we apologized and saw a security gaurd in the hallway and explained to him what was going on.  He called down to the desk for us and finally we got results, they put us in an upgraded room but still felt creep in this hotel!!! Would NEVER recommend this hotel, not even to my worst enemy!!! Horrible and smelled creepy!!! Do not, I repeat do not stay at this hotel!!! Plus it's way down at the skid row area of Vegas.  You can walk but have some good shoes. or a taxi, but it's a long ride.  My 1st and last time at this rat's hole!!
I LOVE the Stratosphere. The hotel is clean, the staff is super friendly, and there's a lot of different activities and places to eat! But when you stay there, you have to note these things:. . 1. It's at the end of the strip. If you plan on going clubbing (besides the cool club at the top of the Tower) or sightseeing at the other hotels, don't expect that they're in super close walking distance. It's not a horrible distance, my friends and I walked pretty much the whole strip one night as long as you're not on a tight schedule and want to see everything, but the transit (which I have yet to have a negative experience with in my 7+ times using it) is super cheap and convenient. Plus, there's a stop right outside the hotel. $20 for a three day unlimited use pass!. . 2. If you're going to get in significantly later than check-in time, you need to call to let them know. My boyfriend and I didn't get there until 4am after a super long road trip, but we called them at midnight and they were still super accomodating. Not to mention there wasn't a check-in line that early in the morning!. . 3. The Stratosphere was one of the first places on the Strip. It's older, it's been remodeled, and it's not as ritzy glitzy as other Las Vegas hotels may be. My first time staying there, I called and made a reservation and got a free upgrade to a higher floor and a tower view!. . Ever since I signed up for my AcePlay card, I constantly receive deals and offers for rooms there. I went last month and paid under $50 (including the resort fees) for two nights! Plus, if you lose or forget to take your card out of the slot machines (whoops), they'll give you a couple extra for free.. . The first time we went we stayed in the Oasis Suite, and it was phenomenal. The jacuzzi tub was clean (and there's a bath and body store with bath bombs and soaps on the little mall thing inside the casino) and the bathroom was huge, plus the bed was comfy! . . And don't even get me started on the Tower itself... the staff there was so nice! My boyfriend is terrified of heights and I dragged him on the rides that hang off the sides. We were the only ones in line for the ride but the staff said they would wait for more people to get on if it made him feel more comfortable. On our second stay we checked out and forgot to go up to the tower, but the woman controlling the line said we could just show our receipt and say that we just checked out and they'd let us up there... and they did! . . Overall: great atmosphere, great staff, and a very comfortable stay. As long as you keep those three things in mind when you book a room here, you should be happy!
I loved this hotel so much, and i loved Vegas. The room was big, clean and at floor 24. It was fabulous. The staff was incredible polite and easy to talk with. The casino was really fun, even tough it was a better deal for them than for me ;). Nice food, incredible pool at lv 8, a lot of shops wich I loved. The only ting I noticed to be a minor weakness is the opening hours at the shops. To be in a city wich is never asleep, they should be open longet than 9 pm... And to the thrills at the roof..   OH MY GOOD! The one is sooo short,  but still the craziest thrill I ever seen. Scared the crap out of me ;). . But, all over: I am really in love with this hotel and i cand and will recommend it to others :)
So there is that good ole' saying that you get what you pay for right? Well in this case I ended up only needing a hotel for an extra night while staying in Vegas and didn't want to pay anything over $100 just for less than 24hrs. I use the Orbitz mobile app and first hotel that popped up was the stratosphere for $29 a night! What a steal because after being a bit apprehensive to book this room do to the area of the strip it's located in, I got past that and gave this place the benefit of doubt. Sure enough when i checked into my room it actually was a pleasant surprise! WOW it had to have been in the renovated tower (Central) because the hallways were clean, free of that nasty smoke smell and the room was your basic over night room. If you need a quick place to crash for a crazy cheap price consider this place!
Disappointed, I was there 3 days/2 nights, I was never able to use the WiFi...same problem 5 years ago... Good accommodation for $40, the tower is the top..the gym, no comment!
so we checked in July 16 2014 the process took about 25 minutes and the girl we went to was new. She did have a trainer with her but she wasn't being much help. I booked this trip 4 months in advance and had a detailed description of what I needed. I needed  two beds in each room with adjoining rooms. Right away she told me  they didn't have  what i requested, and I started getting upset because I told her that I booked the rooms four months ago and I even called to confirm what I had needed. And the person on the phone told me it would not be a problem they had  my reservation exactly as I had requested. So the lady goes and talks to the manager comes back out and says oh we can give you a discount on an upgraded room usually it's $30 a night but will give it to you for 15 and that way you can have your joining rooms and two beds in their new upgraded tower. Which wasn't very well upgraded to say the least. The rooms are kinda small and the maids absolutely sucked. we had put the service sign up on the door so they can clean and they didn't show up til damn near 4 o'clock and all they did was make the bed. they left the trash cans full. And all the trash in the room . The water was shut off for 4-5 hours one day when we were there which was pretty ridiculous. we couldn't even flush the toilet and wash your hands in  our room. The nice part about this is that we found a lot of nice places to gamble in the hotel we met up with a pitboss named Mike, he is absolutely great he told us all kind of secrets and what we can do to get upgrades next time we come. we did a lot of gambling in the casino and drinking in the casino. everything was great except for the whole check in process and the water being out. There's a great little diner called roxys that's open 24 /7 inside the hotel. Other than that place so there's not really a lot to eat in the casino but it wasn't a big deal because the prices were reasonable. I would probably stay at this casino again if they can get my reservations right. We go to Vegas probably every 6 months for a couple days at least it would be nice to finally have a home days place that we know we can stay in Philadelphia round from hotel to hotel we all enjoyed the stratosphere except for the check in process in the crappy made those things can be overlooked in the the name of having good fun
We were doing a quick, 2 day trip just for fun and I found a good deal on a room at the Stratosphere.  I was a littledisappointed in how far the hotel was from the main part of the Strip (it's about $20 for a taxi ride to the opposite end) but the room was pretty good.  We were on the 24th floor which was pretty quiet.  Not much of a view but the bed was big and comfortable.  The bathroom is split (toilet/shower and sink) and very small.  I wish there was a coffee maker in the room.  The hotel itself is much less crowded then all the other Strip ones we've been to which is fine is you're just planning on sitting at a table or machine to gamble.  We didn't see any of the shows offered there but we did go see the thrill rides which are pretty scary and entertaining to watch.  Restaurant selection is very mediocre but the Air Bar on the 107th floor is great.  If you're just looking for a clean, well priced room close-ish to the Strip, I'd say this was a good option.
Worst hotel ever. There was mold in our shower and it took them over an hour to come and clean it. Didn't offer any sort of compensation or anything. I will never stay here again.
Stratosphere is a decent place to stay especially if you are on a budget.  My room was comfortable and clean.  The casino is large and not smoky.  The restaurants were conveniently located throughout the casino floor with a lot more quick cheap options on the second floor.  The only drawback is it is a few extra minutes drive from the Strip.
I would've rated this an excellent experience,  however I paid for a premier room which are the higher level rooms with a view. I wanted a nice room for my wedding anniversary.  They gave us a cruddy handicap room on the 6th floor with a view of nothing. I was outraged, bc it was not a premier room that I had paid extra money for and then they told me all the premier rooms are booked and I could have a premier room tomorrow. I was only staying Vegas 2 nights. So half my trip I spent in a subpar room. And how were all the rooms booked even though I booked one. They reimbursed me a resort fee for one of the days. I felt that wasn't enough, but I didn't complain. I wanted to make the best of my trip. My husband and I were both disappointed and will not be staying there anymore. I felt that because we are young they felt that we weren't going to look into it or complain about it. When I first complained all she kept saying  was that I don't think you booked a premier room and there's none available. I have the receipt to prove it.  The other lady tried to say that it says subject to availability on the rooms on the receipt, but once again she was wrong. It said king or queen bed subject to availability. The first thing I did was read the fine print. They should just own up to their mistake or whatever it was instead of trying to make some lame excuse. I did end up getting the premier room on the 23rd floor the next day and it was way better than the level 6 room. It just would have been better if they would have have is the correct room that I paid for in the beginning. Good thing we had good food on the strip to make up for the crappy room. Our anniversary was saved by pampas Chusscaria. Oh and the tower was nice I can't deny it.
This was my first time staying at the Stratosphere and before coming I didn't have high expectations due to the price. I wish I could rate the man at the front desk who checked me in separately because he was just simply amazing. After leaving the front desk though, it started to go downhill. The weekend that I was in Vegas the weather ranged from being 102-107, and the air conditioner in the room was more like a small fan. There were two beds in the room and the air could only be felt on the bed CLOSEST to the fan. Walking in the room, we were greeted with a stuffy, hot atmosphere. Also, the bathroom got overwhelmingly hot, so that we had to keep the door open while taking a shower so we wouldn't have a heat stroke. The bathtub/shower was so high from the floor that I almost fell getting out of it at least twice, and NO I was not drunk. All in all, I would never stay here again it's too far from the strip and I've stayed at better hotels in Vegas that weren't that much more expensive.
Will never stay again...room was not clean...there was hair in the sink and shower, shower fixtures were rusty, $2 showerhead barely had pressure, tv didnt work when we arrived,,,it took over 2 hours for someone to come fix it.  Over a 4 night stay, housekeeping never offered new towels or linen...restaurant offerings were poor quality...the hallways floors on the 14th floor were never cleaned over our stay there...debris all over the hall carpet and we observed a large chunk of food that sat near one of the elevators for 3 days.  I was happy that I had clorox disinfectant wipes with me because I had to use them to clean the room myself. Since the room wasn't clean, I was definitely not interested in checking out the pool. This was my first visit to Vegas so we spent our time visiting other hotels and casinos and doing tours and other activities and only slept and showered the best that we could with the poor shower head and water pressure.  I will gladly spend more for my hotel on my next Vegas visit to be more comfortable.
Called and spoke with Jackie at housekeeping asking for an extra blanket. She said they do not have extra blackest but can give us sheets instead. I said yes and she will send some up. It's been over an hour and they have not come. It's 1:30am don't think they wi be coming. Very disappointed.
We enjoyed staying here. The rooms were nice and the food was great. However, at night I would not recommend walking the strip in that area. It's not a very good area. The hotel is also considered "downtown" if you're taking a shuttle. So it's extra cost despite it being on the strip. Showtime shuttle said it's closer to downtown that's why the rate is higher. Due to the area at night, we will not stay there again.
my wife and i love this place. its also a great place to take kids. we have stayed here several times. good rooms at a great price. i just wish they would hook peolpe up with a room after spending several days there. always clean and helpful. the check in process always takes a minute but its worth your time.
