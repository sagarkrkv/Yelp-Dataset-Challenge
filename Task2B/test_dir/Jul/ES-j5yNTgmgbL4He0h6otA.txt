If you feel you MUST experience some semblance of Oktoberfest while you're in Vegas, this is the place. My friends and I found ourselves here after we noticed that the British pub Firkin on Paradise was no longer in business. We figured we could at least grab some cold German beers and comfort food here, and that's what we got. They have all your wursts and schnitzels here; I got the schnitzel that wasn't all breaded and fried, and I thought it was pretty good, but like most other items on the menu a bit overpriced. I'd been here once before just to grab a cold brew and it's surprising that they don't have a lot of different beers here; there's only a few varieties, if memory serves. I just went with a lager, which was a refreshing accompaniment to my hearty meal. We were kept entertained during the meal by the one-man band playing his heart out on the stage. Not only did he keep the music going, he got the audience to participate in a stein-holding contest, which was pretty damn impressive, I must say! Our waitress was friendly but a bit lax when it came to checking on us, even though it wasn't super-busy at the time. Overall, a solid OK if you're in the mood for this kind of thing!
I came here during my last Vegas trip as I saw it across from the Hard Rock and had to check it out.. Being from Germany and having been to the original in Munich several times i had to see how it compared.. Surprisingly, it was quite similar. of course the Vegas version, newer, brighter, shinier, much more expensive.. Everything is somewhat authentic, the menu items served are correct, how they are prepared, not so much.. I would not come eat here, but if you want a HUGE German beer and a different atmosphere than the rest of Vegas, this would be the place to check out.
unless you're a soccer (futbol) hooligan do not go here during world cup soccer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  holy crap at 5pm there were so many drunk doucheburgers (and i like to party yo) i actually had to leave fearing i'd end up in a fight and in a lv jail.
Although it wasn't busy when we went, I'd recommend anyone go there for a very fun, albeit goofy, German experience.. . They have live music and do silly things. A lady with shots for $5 that includes a free spanking. lol.. . I was chosen as a bell ringer for a song and automatically entered into the beer chugging contest. I won, of course.. . After all, two German's on holiday that we met brought us there. I had to impress!. . We drank the ale, but didn't eat.
Great German experience!  This location mirrors the original German location, apparently.  The live band was great!  The servers are dressed in German bar maid attire.  The gal walking around selling shots & giving spankings was a hoot!  Very lively and noisy place indeed, but for sure a fun place.  The food was good that we had.  The dessert was ok.  The apple shots we had after dinner were yummy.  Fun to be there with a group, not a good conversational restaurant.  We had fun and enjoyed our German cuisine.
We have taken all three kids there for their 21st birthdays. Good German food & beer. Love the band singing drinking songs. Great atmosphere. Have been to the one in Munich several times so I can compare. This is the first time we had been there without a group. Still had fun with the people at our table. Take a taxi from the strip and you will not be sorry.
Overpriced, commercialized, Vegas stop. $9 for a mug of beer? Really! . . The only thing that was great was the German band. . . Waitresses would look like men if they had short hair.
I went here to watch the World Cup final. It was packed, but we had reservations luckily. I ordered a pretzel with Brie and liver mousse to start, it was delicious and went great with the dark beer The Dunkel. For dinner I ordered the CurryWurst and it was so damn good, and my new Hefe Weizen went just right with it as well. For dessert, the apple strudel, not that good, it tasted just as good as a toaster strudel. Idk, maybe on a day not so busy it wouldn't have felt like it was fresh out of the microwave. . . The servers were on it , 10/10. . The atmosphere - 10/10. . I will return, I will order more meat and drink more beer. . . You should go here, it's fun and tasty. Done.
If you want a fun night of drinking, this is the place to be! Before you know it, you'll be singing with the band and swaying in unison with your beer in hand! And you'll probably be laughing hysterically as your friend gets paddled on the behind after taking a shot! Those ladies don't go easy with the paddle! . . Besides the drinking, the food is nothing to get excited about. I'm personally not a big German food fan, so paying a high price for food I don't like isn't so appealing. I'm still shocked that a pretzel was $14. How much does it really cost to make a pretzel?! Yes it's large, but not big enough to justify the cost. And it tasted like every other pretzel. I tried one of the sausage dishes, and well, it tasted like sausage. Nothing special. . . Bottom line, fun atmosphere, but I'll pass on the food.
The atmospher here is very causal,  the waitress we had was very nice and really from Germany. She was more than happy to answer any questions and the food was very good. I also like that they have  german beer too!
Oh my gosh this place is incredible.. . Not only did I get spanked by a 6+ foot German woman, I also took a shot of who knows what, drank two LITERS of Hofbra Hef, ate a pretzel larger than my face, and had a German man drop his huge horn on my table. I also screamed lyrics in a foreign language that I didn't understand nor had any clue what I was saying, and also sang Garth Brooks to my friends.. . Was it expensive? Yes. Did the spanking sting for about twenty minutes after my paddling? Yes. Was it worth it? HECK YES. This is my new favorite place to get trashed in Vegas.
Had a great meal, met 2 young men from Switzerland at our table, musicians were good.    A great evening !!
Great place for good German Food and Entertainment! Service was friendly and very responsive and food was very authentic (my family is Austrian). Fun place for the some great German beers and lots of food!
I took my German family here while they were in town visiting my girlfriend and I (she's German). Wow, what a disappointment. . . First of all, this place is priced like this is universal studios... Inside disneyland... Inside Disney world. Seriously. 16-18 dollars for 1 liter beer?! Ja, OK! That's a bit of exaggeration ( though the price is accurate), but the whole place felt like you were being hard sold to spend more money. I mean the desserts are TEN dollars! Items like that make this place outrageously priced, and not affordable for a regular visit. . . The second part that was a disappointment was our waitress. She obviously didn't know much if anything about Germany or the menu, seriously mispronouncing a few items over and over even after my German family repeated it back the right way. Now, I'm not a stickler for doing some sort of accent or anything, but it showed a lack of authenticity there, and I appreciate a place that tries to give you the real feel (especially in Las Vegas!). . What's more, we felt like she was trying to push things on us, and the second we said hey... We had some coupons for 2 free beers with dinner... She became quite unfriendly and unhelpful. We got the impression we weren't spending enough money for her. I get being a server is difficult, been there... But we were a very easy table and the place wasn't nearly full. No need to flip the switch just because we aren't going nuts on ordering stuff.. . I almost laughed out loud when she came by with a "retail menu" and told us to order our gift shop items through her so that she gets the credit...really? I can't remember the last place a shopping menu was pushed on you. . . We also didn't particularly enjoy the music, it's very cheesy, and since my family isn't from Bavaria, they could not stand that kind of music haha we were excited to leave. . . To be fair, the bratwurst sampler dinner and the schnitzel were decent quality, which is what earned this 2 stars instead of one. However we saw a really strange pattern at our table and the tables around us... Orders came out no more than 5-10 minutes after being placed. Like our full entrees! I've worked at enough restaurants to know there is some serious pre-cooking going on back there, as nothing can be cooked to order so fast. At this price, that's just another reason to not go back.
