Awesome shark pool kids loved it! But I have to say not impressed with the room and maintenance.. Called maintenance at about 9:30 pm because it was kinda warm and the ac wasn't really cooling maintenance man came and said "honestly that's as cold as it will get these ac units are old" don't get me wrong I understand it won't be like the South Pole in here but it felt like 80 degrees all night found it very hard to sleep... #disappointedatthegoldennuggegthotelandcasino
I was on a road trip and decide to spend the night in Vegas, I usually stay on the strip but I sometimes like to check-out the circus on Fremont street. I called about 1:00 pm to reserve the room no problem.  When I show up at the parking garage the  attendant told me I was not on the guest list they had given  him that morning and he would not let me in. They should upgrade theirsystem to keep this from happening. Now am a little  pissed at this point. Not a good way to treat guest.  I parked at the four queens next door for  4 dollars, and walked back to the nugget to check in. This turned  out to be a good thing, I won 180.00 on a slot machine in the four queens as I was walking back to my truck.  I did my gambling at the four queens that night   Now the good. The golden nugget has the best rooms on Fremont street, even the Carson rooms are good size and clean with flat screen TV's. When I'm with my wife we stay in the Rush tower, these are very nice rooms.  We found  that they are not generous about  room comps so we play slots all up and down Fremont street. I would give them 4 stars if  the garage thing would have gone better. I will be back.
My Honeymoon week. We rented a Spa Suite well I called on the master suits a/c no one ever came. It only goes down to 70....wouldn't be so bad but the floor to ceiling windows which we kept close and the down stairs to 69 STILL DIDN'T HELP...NO ONE CAME. Toilets didn't flush oh did I mention I spent $4,000 on this room AND the neighborhoods smoked skunk weed so bad you got a contact high everytime you even went to the elevator you can only imagine the room. Customer service SUCKED. THEY WANTED TO DO SOMETHING AFTER I WANTED TO CALL THE COPS. LMAO. Don't care about the weed but I paid for 24 jour service.
Charge for internet, drinks while gambling, $15 min on blackjack table,  rude dealers,  stay at your own risk!
I have never stayed at this hotel. We always stay at the 4 Queens for free. My husband and I like to gamble and it doesn't seem like your points add up to much at the Nugget. The 4 Queens always comps our rooms and food, even free dinner at Hugo's! The Nugget is pretty inside, and their casino floor is clean. But I think something should be said about the employees. They ALL hate being there! I asked one older bartender who is always so grumpy if he liked working there and his response was a loud "I used too!" I don't know what happened after the remodel, but all the old timers still working at the Nugget after like, 20 years, are miserable. I feel bad for them. it says a lot about a place when they treat their employees badly. The 4 Queens have awesome bartenders that greet you with a handshake, a smile, and they always remember your drink even if you haven't been there in months!
I was impressed with the casino and hotel for the cost we paid for this last minute trip. The standard was up to par and the pool was impressive. But what I didn't expect, and we were never informed when booking or checking in is that they can't guarantee a parking place for hotel guests! Ridiculous! My fiance is driving around trying to find a nearby parking lot for us at this moment. Seems like this place gips you in the smallest things - parking n/a, coffee in the room $10, microwave $20/nt. etc. Let's not mention the Guido wanna be Bartender at the adult pool who took over 20mins to serve us drinks 2 days in a row. Apparently conversation with the other couple at the end of the bar was more important the waitress even had to interior so he'd start making drinks for their customers.
Excellent hotel for the downtown experience. We stayed in the Rush Tower. Upon check in we presented our Landry's card and were upgraded to the Rush Tower Jr Corner Suite. Room is very large with two  flat screen tvs's, large leather sectional, two chairs, foyer with table, and very nice bathroom.  . . Downfall--shower/bath combo. No walk in shower. Still for the price we got a 5 star room.
"Third time - not such a charm". . We have stayed here 3 times in the last 12 months.. . 1st time was my original review. . 2nd time was just as good as the first. . . This time, not so good. There was a room cleanliness problem. Staff was inattentive. .  Parking, a joke. I was literally told by both valets to try the 4 Queens parking lot. I had an active room key - a JOKE!!!!!! This was at 11pm on Saturday. Left my car and key, told valet I was going inside and demand to check out at that time and not pay for Saturday night, Wife tried to make a spa appointment, was reading off a package on the GN website and was told by the staff that there was no package like this. Girlfight in jacuzzi.....I don't know what has happened but I really had a great time before, I hope they get it together.. . Stayed July 3-6 2014
Upgraded to the Gold tower for three nights.{$60 extra June 27-30th}.Saturday night started well. Won $700 at the tables and slots, Saturday night till Sunday Morning there was a loud party next door till 5am.Had to call Security at 4:45..then the hallway doors stopped slamming..yelling and swearing too. Sometimes I think alcohol should be illegal for some yahoos. Thought the Nugget had better clientele, but this was a night from Hell,they took off our $20 upgrade charge for that night..only ruined our whole Sunday as we were exhausted all day. Pool was great Sunday until 4pm..then the alcohol fired up rowdies partied hard. I remember when Vegas was classy,but Frank Dean and Sammy are long gone ,rest in peace,we won't stay here again..to bad..used vto love it here. 5th stay here. Hotels are focused on the revenue from hard drinking,loud,club kids now. JZ
It's not a bad hotel at all. We always stay on the new strip and decided to have an extra night in Vegas so we booked a room here for a night. It was better then expected. I do have to say some of the staff seemed a bit  unhappy. I wish this hotel were on the new strip though. The pool was awesome. We liked the shark tank. It was pretty neat. It'd be nice to have a pool somewhere for adults only like this one. On checkout day it sounded like the people upstairs were going to fall through the ceiling which was kind of annoying, but not the hotels fault. Overall our stay was great and we would come back again.
The rooms are nice, the pool area is nice. For the price I feel like it's a great place to stay at. I stayed at the Plaza and the Golden Nugget is much much better. It smells good here, not like cigarette butts steeped in water like the Plaza smelled. I highly recommend this place for its proximity to Fremont Street, the comfy bed, nicely decorated room, casino area, and fabulous pool. You won't regret your stay. I liked it much better here than on the main strip, more down to Earth people here, some ghetto/trashy people but they won't ruin it for you and there are a minimal amount of those. There are lots of families here so don't get your swimwear in a bundle if a kid splashes you at the pool.
I'm truly shocked at how much traffic still moves through downtown LV! The Golden Nugget truly is a gold mine. At 3pm on a Tuesday there was a good 15 minute wait to check in. On a Wednesday morning around 9am there was also a line to check out! . . We stayed in the Gold Tower and the suites are spectacular! Lots of space, comfortable beds, and nice tv's in the bedroom and bathroom. The shower doesn't really have a good layout and isn't friendly for older folks since I found it a little difficult to get in and out. . . The elevators were really slow but the rooms and the casino floor have aged really well. The dining options at the Golden Nugget are endless and can satisfy any palate. . . The value is definitely here and I would definitely stay again if i longed for a downtown experience!
Only Decent Option in Old Vegas. . I always like the Nugget.  My wife and I prefer old Vegas when we stay because it is much more affordable and easier to get around.  . . The Nugget has the best pool option of any hotel downtown and at least feels like main strip option.  . . The hotel is pretty nice and the new tower that they built is beautiful.  . . Two issues here though, . . The new tower that they built doesn't allow the pool to get much sun during the day.  . . The buffet is terrible, I haven't been in about a year, but last time it was the worst breakfast I had in Vegas.  . . If your looking for pretty nice hotel in Old Vegas, this place is always a great option.  . . Just stay away from the buffet.. . Thanks
It was girls weekend in Vegas, Baby!  The pool in this place is very unique as it has sharks and sea life swimming  in a tank along side you. Pool service is almost non-existant, so be prepared to fetch for yourself.  We were there on the Saturday and Sunday..so the pool was VERY crowded, but a lot of fun.  Our room was comfy. Beds were made up with nice thread count sheets. There is a variety for anyone in the casino and the sports book was quaint and fun.  The valet was BUSY but my car arrived unscratched.  Its really all I ask for!  The downtown vibe is very fun.  I usually stay on the strip. This hotel did not disappoint.  Dining at the Chart House there is very good and expensive. This seemed to be the nicest hotel in Downtown Vegas.
The hotel is large, cheap (we payed $50 for the night), and aesthetically pleasing. I was actually surprised how great it looked, and there's even a nice looking shark tank by the pool. The burger place in the casino area - "The Grille" - is somewhat overpriced. A cheeseburger and fries will run you $10, but since the hotel is located in downtown anyway, I doubt there's cheaper food. Location is prime; right on Fremont Street,there is a lot to do in the night. There's live music, some entertainment, and more casinos than you could count. I disliked smoking being permitted in the common areas. I have no problem with the casino being a smoking area, but the lobby, shopping areas within the casino, and restaurants should not permit smoking. Other than that, I enjoyed my stay.
Parking sucks.. Valet full, self parking full. Staff told us to be patient when driving around full self parking area waiting for someone to leave
On scale of 1-10 I would give this hotel a 39! It was amazing! The pool was amazing!!!!!!! I would definitely go back! It basically has everything from pina coladas to a water slide going through a shark tank with live sharks!!!!!!! It was amazing!
Worst experience ever!!! Went there from the strip just to try it out for my birthday, first we got a small room after we told them we want an upgrade for my bday month before when we made the reservation on the phone. Then they tried to charge $50 per night for the suite cuz they sold out, ehh not my problem, don't guarantee nothing on the phone then!!!!! Second, we play table game, I ordered 1 chivas water and 1 bottles water, they told me no, only one at a time. Seriously?!!!!! I'm a bartender from Hawaii! I have the craziest house rules back home, but not able to have water with my drink? WTF!!!!!This is effin Vegas!!!!!! Third, when my husband left his cigarette butt in the ashtray without killing it completely, this fat ass old bitch literally slammed an empty ashtray on top of the dirty one then she gave it and my husband a mean look, sorry bitch, you deal in downtown, we don't don't need your attitude here when we receive VIP treatment on the strip!!!! We checked in at 2pm and checked out at 9pm the same day. So yeah, completely fail on the experience here. It sucked big time, never come here again, never play here again and we will make sure that all of our friends do the same.  Because this place doesn't deserve any business based in their credibility and hospitality.
Let me start by saying I don't give many one star reviews. But our experience was horrible. We booked a trip on Priceline and chose the Golden Nugget because we have stayed here a few times and always enjoyed it. First of all, we pull up and they tell us the parking garage is full so we need to park in an overflow lot two blocks away. No problem. We check in and they only have one room left according to the checkin guy. We needed two beds but took the single with a roll away anyway. Went to the room and it definitely hadn't seen a remodel in years. The room reeked of smoke. OK. No what. We called the front desk and asked if maybe we could get an air purifier or something. Nope. Nothing. They said they could "deodorize" our room whatever that means. The smoke smell was so overpowering that we left and got a room at Mandalay Bay. Now we were going to drop some $$$ at the nugget and even had reservations for a cabana but they obviously didn't give a crap. Terrible customer service. Would have expected better.
Stayed here for 1 night on a wednesday to try the hotel.Its a good hotel to stay away from all the chaos from the strip. Parking was easy its a parking structure with 4 floors. There was a check in line had to wait for about 10 min to check-in. If you have Rush Tower there is a seperate check-in desk at the tower. Didnt mind the wait because only payed for a 2 person stay didnt want to pay the 3rd eprson charge. The room is big and smeel clean. The bed was very comfortable. What i didnt like is that our window had a view to the generator on the roof of the 5th floor should of tried to switch room. The pool was a good experience to see the fish and sharks so close. My daughter was a bit scared at first and didnt want to swim and try the water slide. After a couple of minutes she had the best time in vegas. Loved the Water Slide and the pool. Didnt want to leave the pool. After the pool she took a bubble bath on the big tub. There is a strip next to the hotel with a nice view at night from lots of lights. Check out was easy and there was no line in rush tower. We check out 1 hour later for free because we stayed at rush tower. There is abit of a drive from the strip to the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to familys. Kids loved the water slide. (TIP)Go early to the pool to reserve your chairs to get a good spot.
Nice clean rooms, wonderful staff, beautiful aquariums in Chart House and at the pool. This place is a lot of fun and close to everything. Our room looked down onto Fremont Street Experience. Just an overall great experience here. We are locals and wanted a staycation and this was perfect! Happy hour at Chart House is a great deal plus dinner at Vic and Anthony's was amazing! The breakfast buffet was fantastic! Great price too for our room!
I know, I know, I am in Downtown Vegas so what do I expect?. . For starters I expect that the machine I am playing to be clean. I was sitting at the bar playing video poker and watching a game. The bartender was nice enough. I went to hit Max Bet and found out I couldn't because it had so much crap on the button it was stuck in one position. I feel like to needed a Lysol bath after gambling here. . . Needless to say I didn't last long.
I never thought I would be giving the Golden Nugget 5 stars! But if you stay in the new tower, Rush Tower, it is deserving.  I have never stayed in any of the other towers but the Rush Tower is clean, comfortable and easy to access.  We travel to Vegas often and stayed last time at the four seasons for an entire week.  Coming back for a shorter trip we decided the nugget was the best option.  The gambling is reasonably priced, the cocktail waitresses come around often, and you never have to wait for an elevator.  . . The only negative and it was a huge negative was the Rush Tower Valet.  We came in late Saturday night and they tried telling us valet was full.  My husband did not take that as an answer and they eventually found a spot for us.  The customer service and timeliness of valet was disappointing but didn't take away from our overall experience.
Awful stay, registered for a non-smoking room assigned to a smoking room.  It was awful, went back down to the front desk, nothing available, they would have one available after 11, the following morning.  Wrong, it wasn't ready, the check in clerk said he would have house keeping call us is we could move rooms & then shower, so we could go play.  No call from room service, we finally after checking several times out room was ready. Not in Vegas often, but will not stay here ever again!
I was nervous about staying in such an old hotel, but it turned out to be the best stay I've had in Vegas. The hotel was renovated and absolutely beautiful! Our room was gorgeous, the bed was super comfortable, and everything was clean and new.. . We loved having a room so close to Fremont Street!
My sister and I did a quick weekend Vegas trip and decided to stay here because we like downtown and got a good rate. Parking was very crazy as is to be expected on a Friday night. The valet was full, but a very helpful bellman helped me to maneuver around all the cars after taking care of our luggage.. . We stayed in an upgraded room in the Gold Tower, and it was plenty big for two people. The amenities are decent, and I loved the huge, soft bed. My sister has stayed at the Golden Nugget before, so she knew to bring some cups for the Keurig machine. That helped us avoid wasting time and money at Starbucks. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants since there are plenty of better choices within easy walking distance. . . The pool area is a big draw, and it's pretty chaotic. Luckily, there's another pool on the second level that is smaller and a little more serene. You do have to pay an entry fee, but you get assigned your own giant chaise lounge. Plus, no kids running and screaming around the pool! . . The service at the Golden Nugget was exceptionally good. You can tell they really train their staff well. Every employee greeted us when we walked down the halls, and they would always hold the elevator for us. I would happily return on my next Vegas trip.
I absolutely loved the atmosphere of the hotel. I don't usually stay very long in the hotel room but I definitely noticed the shower having black mold. I woke up feeling congested and miserable. Definitely don't recommend staying at the hotel.
I have been there 2 times this summer  each for a week stay.   I room in the Carson Tower on the Upper Floor. . . Good during the week Price No Smoking Tower.... . Valet next to your tower Great!!! Idea.   . . Now for the Bad... Housekeeping Sucks!!! and seem not to care.  Will I stay again.. Depends.... I was pretty Ticked off about how they handled my Dirty Room.
1st let me say- our overall experience was good. But the 1st room we were in in the CARSON TOWER is DEF NOT a 4star quality hotel! Its almost motel like amenities. It has an old school window a/c unit, NO comforter on your bed, (PS- when I called  housekeeping for a blanket I was told they don't have any in the hotel?) & an old run down single sink bathroom. BUT swimming in "THE TANK" made the stay completely worth it! The kids had so much fun. The staff at the pool were so friendly! However, when we returned to our room we discovered the a/c unit had leaked & flooded our room a bit. We had a few things get wet. And the TV would not turn on & when taking a shower we discovered the bath tub would not drain. We called the front desk & were kept on hold for 15 minutes. Finally we were transferred to another room, but unfortunately they did not have another comp room w/ 2 double beds, so they gave us one king. We were moved to the RUSH TOWER which def was nicer, newer & had 4 star like amenities. But sleeping at night we noticed the room in this room had very thin walls. We could hear the people's conversation next to us. And it sounded like normal speaking voices, nit yelling or screaming or anything. Then when were were tying to go to sleep we could hear the people walking and rolling suit cases or something across the floor. Kinda hard to sleep with the noise level. The shower in this room had a very shower head, but looks are deceiving because the water came out very little, small flow & didn't feel refreshing or like you got clean enough. We were also disappointed to find there wasn't one inexpensive place to eat inside the casino. We were traveling with kids, so we didn't want to pay too much for 5 of us to eat. We did try the buffet once & would not recommend it for the price. If the price was cheaper, then it would be a better value. We also encountered a VERY RUDE employee at the buffet who said my daughter couldn't sit with us or be in there if she wasn't eating. I told her she is on special medication & could not eat for 2 hours after her pill, so she would not be eating & then she said, well then you need to buy her a beverage. Mind you, we were already seated. I explained she couldn't drink either, not even water. I guess she thought were were trying to scam the buffet & feed my daughter a free meal, which we were NOT! She kept a watch on us like a hawk. Made us feel very uncomfortable because she kept coming back by to check. Anyways- to sum. We did have a wonderful time in vegas & would stay again. We LOVED the pool & the shark tank & the slide. Def worth the other hassles.
This is a wonderful classic hotel right on Fremont street.  We stayed here last year and are coming back again this September.  Yes, the fancy resorts on the strip are brand new and gorgeous, but they are also twice as expensive and I really don't want to walk a million miles just to get to the pool.  . . Last year we had a double room in the Carson tower, the oldest building, but also much less expensive as the new Rush Tower.  I mean you are in Vegas... WTF are you doing in the hotel room anyway?  I just need a clean place to sleep and shower and the rest of the time I will be out.  The room was pretty dated with 80's decor (think rust colored flowered drapes) but at least it was clean!  Our room had a big square of carpeting cut out of it and replaced with a square of an almost-matching color.  Our window looked out onto the roof of the Plaza parking garage.  But honestly, who cares... it's a room and it's cheap.. . The pool is gorgeous and the shark tank is amazing.  It's certainly not an Olympic sized swimming pool by any means, but the water slide is super fun and I loved getting a massage from the waterfall coming down on my shoulders and back.  The other infinity pool on the 2nd floor was beautiful too.  You aren't going to be diving or doing laps in these pools... they are for relaxing and drinking!. . We are not fancy people and this hotel is more our style.  It's big enough to walk around comfortably, reasonably priced, and right in the middle of the Fremont Street Experience.
I love the golden nugget. It's a great place to stay and have fun. I'm giving the place 3 stars because of there sportsbook. I have been here for the last 3 days and have placed bets over $11,000 and only once have they offered me a free drink coupon. The people in there who work behind the counter are not friendly and act like your bothering them when you want to place a bet. The tickets I've come back with that are winners they act like they don't want to pay me. Like I'm taking their money? What's up with that? It's sad that I now had to go and sit inside the casino hosts office that is located inside the Keno area and complain. I talked to the manager of the sports book who's name is tony and he said he was surprised as to my complaint. But I informed him I was denied to place a $3600 wager on baseball by the black girl at the counter so I said ok and walked across to Binions horseshoe and placed my bet there. Tony was upset to hear that I took my business elsewhere. But oh well. Bottom line is yelpers we need to hold these business accountable after all we are spending our money there. I'm done with this sportsbook.
