The wait is worth it! After waiting more than an hour in line for a Father's Day lunch, I was pleased with the amount of choices and the quality of the food! I don't remember what I got because it's been two weeks but you guys should definitely try their pad thai! Amazing! Definitely save some room for the dessert because most of the dessert is perfect. My favorite was the brownie, fudgy goodness. I tried some in Atlantic City a while ago and it tasted even better! . . A few critiques about this buffet:. - The TV shows that there's French macaroons, but they only have coconut macaroons, but they were still delicious!. -The beef that they cut up for you looks kind of disgusting.... - The wait isn't because there's too many people (the buffet is huge!) The problem is that there's a lack of waitors to clean the tables. When we walked in, there were so many empty tables that just needed to be cleaned up.. . Overall, this was one of my favorite buffets and I would definitely be back next year (:
So disappointed.  Didn't know menu is different on weekdays - was so looking forward to eat crab legs.  The buffet choices use to be better - so few things available.   Dessert items are still delicious.
I'm not a big fan of Buffett's. When ever we have friends and family come to town they all seem to want to hit up the buffett lines (Oh Boy!!!) I have to say, this buffet is better than all of the buffets I have been to on the strip. The price was about $24 each. The caliber of food was much higher than typical buffets. I'm more about quality than quantity, fortunately this buffet has both. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because its a buffet and I am a fan however I do not believe that any buffet can achieve a 5 star rating.
Great Sunday Brunch!! Getting fuel up before my race tonight!! Rock n Roll Las Vegas Nighttime Half Marathon!! Thanks Tita lilia for the free meal, she's the winner to eat for a life time here at Studio B!!
Before Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon, the buffet at M resort was probably my second favorite after Wynn and Bellagio.  Nowadays, the buffet list has shifted a bit as Bacchanal is king for me.  However, the M resort buffet is still a very good buffet. It's usually the buffet I go either on the way into Vegas or on the way back home since it's nowhere near the strip.  It's also the only buffet that I've been to that includes beer, wine, or champagne without an upcharge.  The selections here are your typical premium buffet options such as crab legs, sushi, a carving station, good dessert bar, etc.  It's clean and I like that there's a lot of room to maneuver around the food stations.  Come here and stuff your face before you head back to Cali.
Update - still getting VIP line passes etc, so we keep going, despite a steady decline in food options. There is no more brunch buffet on the weekends, it's just regular all day stuff. A weekend morning brunch without breakfast items is the height of idiocy. No smoked salmon anymore, no omelette station anymore, no eggs benedict or any of that stuff. Weak.. At the register, there are three lines - regular folks, Line pass holders, and guest / Producer and above status. I'm holding a producer status and line passes, and there were two groups waiting at the line pass, nobody at he guest/frequent player line, and nobody at  the regular line. I showed my card at the frequent player line, and was told by the chick behind the counter that she wouldn't be able to help me there, because my card expired last month. What ? There wasn't even a single person at the regular joe schmo line. Way to treat your customers.  Instead of walking to the other end of the casino to wait in line and get a new card, I walked around to the regular line (where not a single soul was waiting) and went right in.. Shitty customer service, food getting progressively worse. There is really no good reason to come here, other than to burn through your comps.
This is my third time eating at studio b by far one of the best buffets in vegas. It's a bit pricey but the food is tremendously good. Everything from the prime rib to the lamb. The variety of salad dishes are phenomenal. The service is pretty good too. But I've got to say I'm very impressed i hope they keep the great dishes and change little from this buffet it's probably one of the classiest in town. If your inVegas do check it out. It's nice that they have unlimited drinks also but trust me that is not the highlight.
This used to be a long-time favorite of ours but we had a horrible experience this year. Went at 7PM on a Tuesday. There was no one in front of us in line, but the cashier kept talking on phone and would not look at us. When I motioned to other cashier on other side of desk, she turned her back to us. When we did get in (maybe 12-15 minutes later), the popular food dishes were almost empty, and the few workers behind the counters were not in a hurry to make more available despite requests. The server brought first round of drinks rapidly but no straws then disappeared for 30-40 minutes (he later said he got a party of 25 in the next seating area). Price has not gone down but the overall experience has seriously declined. Too bad because this used to be my #1 favorite place before the change in ownership and management.
$40 for lunch is a big lunch.  The seafood is meh.  Everything is meh, but there's a lot of everything to eat.  Best part is free alcohol and espressos.  Why can't they do that in every buffet?
Food is good and the free wine and beer are a big plus.  Having said that, it's not what it used to be and the line is RIDICULOUS!   I got in line at 1:40 this afternoon and 50 minutes later, I've made it about halfway through.I know the place is not full, I looked.  This same scenario happened two weeks ago, as well, but I thought I'd give in one more try.  As an M card carrying local, not cool.  Safe to say I won't be doing this again anytime soon.
Terrible. I came here expecting delicious food at an amazing price and left feeling disappointed. The quality of the food was seriously lacking and comparable to Hometown Buffet. The prime rib and baby back ribs were overcooked. The sushi tasted worse than the sushi you find at a gas stations--with undercooked rice and tasteless fish! I'd Rather spend $50 and eat at a better buffet.
I would say this is the second best buffet in las vegas. BELLAGIO is my favorite because of the chilian seabass. STUDIO buffet has the best prime rib though.
I wish I can give this 10 stars. Fabulous buffet. Worth the 40 or so bucks a person. The food is amazing. Always fresh. The dessert selection is so awesome. Everything about it is just fantastic. Highly recommended.
Food is great. The line takes about 45 minutes.  I guess the quality of the food beats out the time a person has to wait.    Overall, the food is very good.  The staff are great.  Mo took care of us.
I always stop here either on my way to Vegas or on the way home. Love their food. Desserts are so worth it. It opens at 11am so I was one of the first ones there.  $40 a person. King crab legs are amazing.. . Their flan and tiramisu...by far the best. . . Their meats are delicious as well. Beer, champagne, and other alchy was included. You need to eat here. The price is cheaper than other buffets in Vegas too. . . Just eat here and thank me later. You won't regret it.
