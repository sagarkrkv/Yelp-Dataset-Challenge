I really had no problem with this hotel. I didnt get a great view, but I wasnt surprised, as it was EDC weekend, and the strip was packed. I couldve upgraded for one for 20$ but knew I wouldnt be in my room often, so didnt care. I got the king sized bed I wanted. I would say that room service didnt really clean anything, except make the bed and change the towels. The room was nice enough. I wasnt overwhelmed, but I wasnt disappointed either. I'd stay here again if I had an event to attend, and I wont be in the room often. It's nice enough for comfort, but nothing too fancy.
Ok if you've stayed her before and liked your experience, wait another 5 more years until you decide to stay here again. Rooms and customer service have downgraded 95%. We had the resort room. They don't provide covers, just the white sheets. Hallways are rundown. Shower doors are broken. Our sink didn't have the hot water working. Drawers are beat up. Our security box didn't lock. Bathroom door didn't shut close. Writing it all down makes me realize how ridiculous this place is. Oh and if you want to complain about your situation, get ready to be handed to staff with attitude and make you feel stupid for complaining. Paid $780+ for 3 nights. Better off anywhere but here.
Last weekend marked my third excursion to LVNV, and Planet Hollywood, with a close group of friends, all of us travelling from the DFW, TX area.  Thankfully, this will be my last to Planet Hollywood...and I'm not alone several of our group agree with this sentiment.. Two separate experiences that we're horribly handled and concluded our business with your hotel:. 1. During our stay, my wife went to take a bag up to our room on the 23rd floor.  She rode the elevator stopping several times along the way, but discovered when she got to the room...the key card didn't work.  She rode the elevator to the lobby, again stopping along the way.  Went to the front desk and was told she would have to wait in the check-in/check-out line for someone to help.  When she told the front desk person she just needed a key, they huffily told her to give them the key.  They looked up the room and told her she wasn't on the room registry and they couldn't let her in the room.  Sadly, they had taken her ID at check-in and we assumed they had added her.  So, my wife comes and gets me.  I go down to the front desk.  Once again they tried to direct me to the check-in/check-out line.  I refused and told them I was down to see the Manager.  I can't make this part up...they directed me to another line for people waiting to see the Manager about complaints.  I told them I wanted to see the Manager immediately.  The Front Desk person went and got the Supervisor.  The Supervisor proceeded to tell me that they had a "Policy" that additional guests had to be registered to the room.  I explained that the policy shouldn't be used as a cover for poor customer service.  My wife's name is the same as mine, her ID as presented showed the same address, and she was with me at check-in and provided her ID...they had failed to follow their policy and subsequently burdened us with the failure.  The Supervisor just kept restating it was policy.  As I walked away, the Security Guard at the desk pulled me aside and suggested he could go get the Manager to discuss the situation, he didn't feel that the Supervisor was making the situation better.  I told him I would wait.  The Manager, Roberto, came out and I explained the story to him.  He agreed that the failure was theirs and made sure my wife was on the room and reset the key card.  He apologized and offered to remove the resort fees from our bill...I told him I wasn't looking for that, I was frustrated that my wife was treated poorly.  Roberto stated he wanted to do it and he apologized again that there was an issue.  I thought the problem was solved... . 2. When we checked in we had a voucher for a couple of free nights.  This was sent to one of our higher rolling group members (under the friends and family program) who offered it to us for this trip.  We had decided there was no big issue if it wasn't used, we would simply pass it along to the next member of our group.  So, we asked at check-in if it would be honored and we were reassured that it would be.   We asked again before we left the desk and we were told it was already applied.  We found out at check-out that it was not applied.  Once again someone went and found Roberto.  This time Roberto was the failure.  Not only had he not applied what he had offered in our previous interaction, but when we told him about the voucher he told us there was no proof it had been presented, indicating we were not being honest.  Since the voucher was kept by the front desk person at check-in we couldn't even pass it along, it was completely wasted.  He ended up removing one day's worth of resort fees (22.50 versus his offering prior to remove them all) and told us there was nothing else he could do.  Again, I wasn't looking for special dispensation, it was offered at the outset...My problem was the way it was dealt with and that what was offered wasn't honored.. We are in our forties, we have some simple expectations you could learn from: . 1.) Reasonable accommodations at a reasonable price point...5 nights @ 150/Night; AC didn't work, room wasn't cleaned, and we paid $22.50 per night in resort fees for amenities we didn't use.. 2.) Customer Service is exceptional...in this case it wasn't even close.  We're not twenty year olds on spring break...Service means something to us.  If you want us to stay with you twice per year, prove it.. 3.) If you or your employees say something is going to happen make sure it does...if there is a question about whether or not it happened, give us the benefit of the doubt.. This trip there were nine in our group staying with you, we are all gamblers to varying degrees.  Several hundred dollars to several thousand dollars are risked in your Casino by each of us on every trip.  This trip, our losses to your casino ranged from 220 - 7500.  We have no issues losing if we're having fun and are taken care of (ie. treat us well).  However, we are unified in this...Treat any one of us poorly and you lose us all.
We just had an awesome stay here for the weekend. This place is so generous with the comps. We're not high rollers by any means but Planet Hollywood picked up the tab and paid for EVERYTHING. Rooms were over $250 a night and we paid nothing. They comped us at the restaurants and shops and even gave me chips to play at the tables. We ended up walking out of here big winners too so I have absolutely no complaints about this place. Drinks are easy to get and they have a stellar selection of table games and machines. The dealers and other players are all so friendly too. You do get your typical groups of loud douchey drunk meatheads roaming around but that goes to be expected if you're staying on the Strip. Overall one of my top favorite places to stay in Vegas for sure.
I like the location of where this is located which is center strip. Earls and Fat Tuesday is right down stairs and so is the miracle miles shops. Cosmo is right across the street and if I ever need anything, Walgreens is also located at planet hollywood. . . The rooms, however, seem really old. Some things in our room were broken or just old. I had the hollywood hip king room and it was pretty small. Just enough room for the bed. The front desk was able to upgrade my room to a strip view at no cost which was nice. The cost isn't too shabby either. I stayed here because we had an offer for $27/a night. But even without a special, I've seen pretty low prices here for being on the strip.
I had the most horrible experience here. In our first room my husband and I came back to our room from the pool & I went in to shower & found pubic hair stuck to the walls & was absolutely disgusted! We called the front desk and were told management of housekeeping would come up. Mind you, it took  6 tries to get through because the phone was cutting in and out. We waited 2 hrs and no one showed up. My husband went down to the front desk and was given a new room after almost 30 min. We were upgraded to a new room. Went out again to the pool the next day. My husband had emptied his pockets of any loose money (dollars & change) as well as one of our room keys before heading out. When we returned housekeeping had came by while we were gone and $40 that was emptied out of his pockets was gone. My husband called front desk and was told nothing could be done. I called front desk after we were done getting ready to go out and was told housekeeping management can look up who cleaned our room and the time. When we returned my husband went down to the front desk and was given the info about when our room was cleaned. He was told nothing else could be done about the money only that he could file a report to check cameras etc. We love out of the country & leave tomorrow so this hotel pretty much leaves our stay of visiting the U.S. with a sour taste. I will never recommend this hotel to any friends, family of even strangers!
This room is outdated! The lights were not working when we first entered the room and had to jump down maintenance throat just to fix the problem. There were creepy clothing pieces that were displayed in the room which meant a waste of space, so little space that a microwave and fridge weren't accessible. Bed was very comfortable the only reason this establishment received 2 stars! Never will return!
I've never stayed at Planet Hollywood, although I would, their rooms seem very nice! . . Plant Hollywood has gone through some changes since I have lived here, mostly on the facade. From being the front of the extinct Aladdin, to Plant Hollywood to the addition of the Harmon corner. It's modern looking and to some an amazing sight. To me it's ok, it's nice and all but I'm just not overly impressed. . . I do like the finished off look they've given the Harmon corner, adding Twin Peaks and a Bubba's. Anything Vegas can do to make it not seem grimy and trashy. They don't have any 'can't miss' restaurants, Koi is ok. I ate there several years ago and I would go back but that's about it. I've seen Peepshow with Holly and recently Meatloaf in the smaller theatre upstairs, it's good and really not a bad seat in the house. I've also seen Journey in the other larger theatre and we sat high up but the seats weren't awful so for those things. It's cool!
Favorite hotel!! Always stay there when I go to the strip! Great view and location. Service is ok.  But I love the miracle mile IOVE PLANET HOLLYWOOD!
3.5 stars. Forgot to post this review in June. This was the first time we stayed here and the rate of $130 (w/ tax & resort fee) a night for a premium fountain view was a steal. They gave us a double queen room on the 16th floor (Rm# 1695) with an incredible view of the the fountains. Unfortunately, the fountains were not working but it was ok cause we had several shows lined up to see. We love the location of this hotel. We can just cross the overhead pass and be at Aria to see Zarkana, then have couple of martins at the Chandelier inside Cosmopolitan and walk over to Bellagio for some late night gambling. During the day, took the elevator down and shopped in the built in mall, Miracle Mile Shops and had an amazing lunch at Ramsay's Burgr in the hotel lobby. We know this hotel is very busy w/ a young clientele so that probably explains the large scratches on the furniture but its no excuse for housekeeping not to check if several light bulbs are out. Again, these were cosmetic that can be easily fixed and we didn't plan to stay in the room all night. The bed was comfy and sheets were fresh. Bathroom was large and also squeaky clean.You get the standard writing desk, LCD screen, iron / board and a chair of course. The view was the icing on the cake but would have been better if the fountains were working but can't blame PH for that. Last thing, there was a bit of line during check in (took about 25 min at 7:45pm) but check out was a breeze...just drop off your card key in the express box. Will consider staying here again for the location but they need some touching up with the rooms.
this hotel is so wacked!  one star is an overstatement. their computer system couldnt recognize our room number even after we had stayed their for 2 nights! went to the front desk four times until they could fix the problem.  plus their rooms had paper thin walls!  I couldn't rest at all because of the stupid music playing all day by their pool. This looked to me like a 2-1 star motel at best.
Great place to stay right on the strip. Arrived on a Thursday night and check in was swift and even received free upgrade to strip view. Rooms are clean and nice. Elevators are fast and miracle mile shops and earls are right on casino floor. Will definitely stay here again. Only thing is I wish the rooms had some other type of music player besides alarm clock radio Lol
My family and I decided at noon the day before 4th of July to meet friends vacationing in Vegas. We called around and the lady whom wetalked to from planet Hollywood was very friendly and gave a better rate than Priceline. It was a very busy weekend and the valet was completely full when we got there at 1:00am. Which was fine except having to walk to the complete other side of the miracle mile mall. The line to check in was a little lengthy (about 30 min). After we checked in we found our room to be very nice very comfortable beds. My kids loved the huge bath tub and the view. We stayed in the lost in space themed room on the 37th floor. Our room was very quiet and we were in the first room once you walked off the elevator and never heard any noise. The pool was very basic, but the good thing is guests of planet Hollywood are aloud to use the pool at Paris or the flamingo. We used the Pool at the flamingo and it was awesome.  The central location on the strip is also a major plus. I will definitely make this my go to vegas hotel in the future.
SUMMARY: Very dingy hotel with very little amenities. . . I tried to do the "$20 tip trick" (if you don't know what that is then google it) on the check in lady.. but I used $100 instead because I really wanted a suite. The girl sincerely tried her hardest, but they were really out. I ended up giving her a $20 anyways for trying, and she did upgrade our room from whatever we originally booked. . . Tried to call the front desk to ask for a roll in bed, and had to wait 15 minutes before anyone picked up the phone (this was near 3-4AM btw... when it's not so busy in the front).. . Next day called the front desk to ask for a water boiler or hot water so we can make cup noodles (don't judge, we were hung over, lazy, and too tired to leave the room).. Anyways, had to wait another 15 minutes before anyone picked up the phone, then the lady tells us it will be $6 bucks and we will have to wait 2 hours for it... the hell?? Then we just asked for a coffee maker (which is usually standard in most other hotel rooms), and she transferred us to housekeeping, where we waited another 15 minutes for someone to pick up the phone, only to tell us that there aren't anymore. I just want some effing cup noodles man. . . My advice: the location is great, but this hotel honestly sucks. It's dirty and needs some serious renovation. Best part about this hotel is Earl Sandwich.
My husband and I visit Las Vegas every few months and we try a new hotel each time. Planet Hollywood is one that we will never return to, nor will we ever reccommend to others. On most websites I found, this hotel was rated 4-5 stars. I would put it around 3 stars at the most. The hotel allows dogs and we counted four while we waited in line to check in. We could hear dogs barking on our floor all hours of the day. I had reserved a non-smoking room, but I was told that only smoking rooms were available upon our check-in and I was not comped for the inconvenience. The room didn't smell too badly, until we got into the bed and the smell of cigarettes wafted up from the sheets and most likely the mattress. The AC unit was broken and stuck on 60 degrees. It was a bit cold and there were no extra blankets in the room. I tried to reach Housekeeping in search of blankets on 3 occassions and the phone just rang and rang. The room was small for a King Suite and the shower was so small that my 6'0" husband kept hitting his elbows on the shower walls as he washed. There was no uniformed or marked security anywhere that we could see in the hotel or casino and it became quickly obvious that any riff-raff off of the street was welcomed to roam the halls and enjoy the pool. There was no security check at the pool entrance to ensure only guests could enter. There was a large concrete slab filled with lawn chairs on the main level of the pool, no where near the water. There were two pools, above, on either side of that concrete slab. One pool was for 21 and older only, but offered no seating unless you wanted to rent a cabana or day bed for the day. I had planned on renting a cabana, but after seeing the set in stains and very dirty upholstery I reconsidered. We grabbed a slab of concrete close to the pool edge as we saw others doing and sat on our towels. We observed at least 15 people get kicked off of days beds that they hadn't rented. We paid $50 for a bucket of 5 beers. 5 lousy cans of beer, and we had to return the bucket! The other pool was for families and was much smaller with all of the floaties in the water. The area around the pool looked to only have 10-20 lawn chairs and did not accomodate everyone. We were awarded $25 a day  free food and drink with our Total Rewards points, but when we attempted to use them they were denied and we had to settle it with the Front Desk, and then they attempted to over charge us upon check out for the food & drink that was supposed to have been free. The best thing I can say about our stay is that the Yolos resaurant inside the casino is delicious! Tasy Mexican fare all seasoned perfectly and guacomole made to order and prepared table-side. Overall, we were very disappointed in our stay and would not reccommend.
Had to wait in line for 45 minutes in order to get checked in.  It shouldn't take that long to get checked in.  But once we were checked in, the room was a decent size and clean.  The Planet Hollywood is more of a party hotel however and I'm just too old for it.  I buy a room to get rest not to have a place to hold a party.  I should've known better.  I'll try amore adult place next time.
Very disappointed! . . I had a two-day stay: 7/7/14 - 7/9/14.. . The good: I really appreciated the professionalism and politeness throughout the hotel.  The overall appearance of the hotel was good. The casino had a very hip a lively feeling - great music!  The pool area was clean and relaxing. The room decor was average, with somewhat of an artsy look.   . . The bad: When I checked in, I was given the wrong room number. I attempted to access a room that was already occupied. This was a very embarrassing and uncomfortable situation. I had to return to the front desk and wait in line all over again. As I was waiting, there were people walking up and not waiting in line, which added further delay. The attendant apologized, and I know it was an honest mistake, but it really impacted my schedule.  . . The UGLY: My rook looked like it had not been cleaned. I suspect the cleaning crew just added some clean towels and neglected to clean the rest of the room. As I entered the room, the bed looked as if someone had been lying on top of the comforter.  Upon further inspection of the room, I noticed the following:. * A filthy tub with visible dirt and grime. . * A dirty bathroom floor with shoeprints, sticky spots, hair, and a small piece of trash.. * The carpet had dried white spots that crumbled when I ran my foot across it. . * A dusty bathroom countertop with visible finger lines in the dust. . * Dusty tables and dusty areas throughout the bedroom.. * Hair on the toilet seat.. * Hair on the bathroom floor.. * Dirty carpet.. * A small metal rod on the floor in the bathroom.. . I attempted to call Housekeeping and the front desk, but I continued to get a busy signal. I went back to the front desk (2nd time in 30 minutes) to complain, but the line was long, and once again, there were people walking up and not waiting in line. . . I ended up cleaning the room - I dusted, wiped, sanitized, and picked up trash. All of this caused me to be late for a show, but I really could not use the bathroom until I cleaned it. It was just gross.. . I realize this is not a 5-star hotel. However, I expect basic human decency. Those conditions were absolutely deplorable. Shame on you, Planet Hollywood!
I wanted to give this place five stars because if everything had gone right it would've been a five star experience.. . I'm the Maid of Honor for my best friend, we stayed here for her bachelorette party June 27-29. It was six of us girls. . . First, we got there at 11:40 pm Friday night due to THE WORST traffic ever. It took us 8 hours to get to Vegas from LA. . . We're already in a bad mood and when we check in they said they gave away our room since we got there so late so they put us in a room with one king bed and said we could switch rooms on Saturday ............... . One king bed for six girls and they expected us to pack up all our stuff from getting ready in 30 minutes so we could go out Friday night and attempt to switch rooms after the day club the next day? Okay... . I had bought so many decorations and I couldn't use them because I thought we were going to switch room and we ended up not switching rooms because we were so busy so the decorations were a waste of money.. . We had asked for a roller bed when we checked in at 11:40 pm and when we got back to our hotel at 5 am it still wasn't there. I was exhausted and called for the roller bed and it didn't get there until 6 am when they said they'd take it up to the room while we were out. . . Saturday afternoon we get back from the day club and we run out of towels. We call housekeeping for towels and aftertelling us it'd be ten minutes it turned out to be an hour and fifteen minutes. . . Since we didn't have our original room with two queen beds and a roller bed I ended up sleeping with a friend on one roller bed and 4 girls in the King Bed. . . We still made the most of it but that was a seriously shitty inconvenience and they didn't even apologize for their mistake which made it even worse.
Please don't do it! Spend your money some where else. Staff is very unprofessional and don't seem to be concerned about the worst house keeping that I have ever seen. Found a used condom under my bed with other trash.. .  The very next day discovered that I took a bath in globs of gulk  (an actual hand full of hair )from only God know how many guest that have used that tub. I'm so grossed out and disgusted! Never ever going back to that place again.  When asking to speak to a manager, he is in a meeting. .  . The never accept any accountability for any short comings. I have taken out some time to gather information about all of the corporate board of Directors from google. Their phone numbers are available. Please call them to voice your concerns. . . That hotel is too beautiful and convienantly located to go down to the dogs with unprofessional and uncaring  staff. So if you love Vegas call the CEO's and make them aware.
Poor service... Had to ask 3 times for a drink ! The burger was well overcooked ! The only good point and star of the night was the cockail ! All the rest... Pass
Pretty average.  The music was so loud and often had maybe 4 songs competing with each other. The carpets look like they need some TLC
NKOTB conceert.   Why is there 98% ladies.  Where da fellas at.  Cougar and saber tooth gathering.  I won tickets. It's not a bad show.  Tremendous venue
Stayed here over 4th of July weekend.  Had a fantastic time, you cannot beat the location!!. . Check-in was quick and was upgraded to one of top floors of the hotel with an awesome view of the fountains and strip.  Bed was comfy, housekeeping staff was great.  Only issue I had was not having an ice machine on my floor so I had to go down 1 floor to replenish.. . Pleasure Pool was great, liked the fact that you don't have to wait in line or pay to get in unlike other snobby pools in Vegas hotels.  . . Casino slots were very good, won some pretty good money!
This is a review for their customer service and front desk.. . I left a shoe in my room and noticed a few hours after we had already checked out. I called the front desk to find out if it had been found by room service and was told that nothing had been found but it usually takes about 24 hours for items to be brought to lost and found (security) and registered. I told them I was leaving the next morning and couldn't wait that long. The manager told me he couldn't enter the room to check as it was against hotel policy (seems reasonable) but would check with security and call me back.. . I called back 2 hours later and he hadn't heard from the people in lost and found. He told me he'd check in with them again and call me back. He never called so I called back later that night and he still had not gotten a response from the people in security.. . I left two messages at security over the next week and no one ever called me back.
Summary: Attended a July fourth weekend wedding and we were suppose to book a room inside Aria since that is where the ceremony was held but due to procrastination the place was all book up. I normally like to book hotel right smack in the middle of the strip for easy access so I decided to give Planet Hollywood a try. At the time Planet Hollywood sound like a good choice with the fountain view room, easy access to miracle mile shops for my gal, and its right across from Aria/Cosmo which is were the ceremony/wedding will be held.. . Location: It wasn't easy at first, especially for a first timer. Unlike most hotel, you have to drive behind the hotel in order to find the entrance for the valet parking. You also have to make sure you turn the right direction and stay in the right lane otherwise you'll end up at the Miracle Mile Shops valet parking lot.. . Service: Valet was professional, front desk was professional. Both was dealt with at ease. As for housekeeping, here is where the complaint start *cracking knuckles*. . . The night before, we were attending a wedding having a wild night so that means we want to sleep in the next day. Around 10-11am the phone rang. Housekeeping called and ask if we called for maintenance to repair the leak faucet. I told her we did not. She say that she have record that we called. Again, I told her we did not call as I was checking the faucet and there was no leakage. Her response?!?!?! "So, you want me to cancel maintenance?" Irritated, I slam the phone. Not the best way to be woken up in Vegas not to mention her voice was harsh I swear when I answer the phone I thought it was my Mother on the other line.. . Overall: Aside from the housekeeping experience, I would have given three stars but until Planet Hollywood repair the ice machine on the North side 7th floor, my two star shall remain in tack. We were there for 3 days and not once did the machine dispense ice. Every time I push the button the machine sound just like my mood, 'GRRRRR'.
Very disappointed. Worst place ive stayed at. No fridge. No ammenities. I dont understand how a place could charge so much for a room without one. Were in vegas 100 degree weather we need a fridge to keep some water in there to hydrate. I mean ghetto momos have em so why shouldnt they. Everytime i left my room i got lost. Everything looks the same there signs suck i followed em and i just kept goin around in circles. . . The room had a nice bathroom and that was about it. All the furniture had so many dings and scratches on it so they were pretty noticable since the wood was a dark brown...it was all dark and with beige patches since they were chipped.  . . Would never stay here ever again.
I would stay here again. My husband and I booked a package through Costco. We stayed 4 nights for less than 300 dollars. They do charge an unexpected resort fee that I now know all vegas hotels are doing. . . The room was great: good size, clean, good design, nice bathroom.  The hotel has a nice location on the strip. The casino part obviously smells like smoke, but once you go up into the hallways of the rooms, the smell is no longer there. . . It came with free wifi and other standard amenities.
I really enjoy gambling at this casino because of the vibe and the younger crowds. But there service and the rooms suck! I get comps here but it never seems like they're willing to make you happy. The rooms are old and dirty. The mall is okay. Nothing special! Go across the street to the cosmo if you want both great service and amazing rooms!
My bf and I stayed at Planet Hollywood as a last minute decision after we decided we were too tired to go home the day were supposed to. We got a deal off The Hotel Tonight App. We checked in right after booking with no problem. . . The staff was great and very friendly, making the check in experience bearable despite the looooong line. . . The reason for the bad rating is mainly for the maintenance of the room. When we got to our room, the blinds were broken and we weren't able to raise or lower the curtains/blinds. I called the front desk and waited for about over 5 minutes on hold. When the front desk answered, they said the maintenance people would come to fix it. It took them 4 hours to come. We weren't too bothered since we fell asleep but I did have to call the front desk to check up and remind them to send someone. The maintenance guy came and was very nice but was unable to fix it. . . Another issue was the bathroom sink was clogged. It took forever for the water to. go down. We didn't complain about it since we were checking out the next day but that shouldn't have been an issue. . . Overall, the staff was great but they really need to work on maintaining the rooms A LOT better.
As I plan what has become my yearly Vegas trip, I realize this review is way, way overdue so I'll keep it brief and keep it to the basics. . . I like Planet Hollywood for the location on the strip and the fact that it's connected to a mall with shopping, shows, and restaurants. They also seem to cater to a younger crowd and they have good acts here- uh Britney, obvi! The front entrance and parts of the hotel have allot of pow and pizzazz, making it feel very Vegas-y.. . But for the price of my stay, I thought my room could've been cleaner and better kept - I'm pretty sure the vacuum had never seen the underside of the desk. The carpeting throughout the hotel was dingy and rolling up as well; it was pretty tacky actually. Also, the rooms could've had a little more punch to the decor. Between the rooms here and rooms at the Hard Rock, who also does a rock-n-roll/celebrity artifacts type of theme, Hard Rock was way better done. I also liked the casino in The Hard Rock better than PH. Oh, and basically any place has a pool better than Planet Hollywood. Like my neighbor here in Michigan has a nicer pool in his backyard than this place. PH's pool is like a concrete wasteland. There weren't even plants around the pool to liven it up.  They sort-of made up for it by having a second rate Pauly D DJ and after a few (overpriced) drinks, it wasn't too bad of an afternoon. . . I probably wouldn't stay here again but I suppose it's not the absolute worst either. So if you are coming for the shows and a basic pool set-up meets your needs, you'll be ok.
Thursday:  Showed up for a room with two beds. Offered upgrade for $50/night with one bed. Took it for the view. Got to the room and called bellhop. My friend went to use the bathroom and there was urine all over the seat. Called down and they said they could move us to another room but we had to still pay the upgrade fee, and come down to get the new keys. I told them I was over the upgrade and they said we had to go down to the front desk again. Bellman shows up.  Head down to front desk, bellman in tow and they change us to a regular room with two beds, or so I thought. Room had one bed and I called down to complain. Apparently they never had a room with two beds. Said we would be changed in the morning call at 9. Valet was painfully slow. We barely made our cirque show at mirage.  . . In morning called down, nothing. We had to get ready for the show and still no call by 3 pm.  Headed out  and the housekeeper said aren't you supposed to be changing rooms? Headed to the first part of our night and headed back to room. Still no call. Headed back down for event at the AXIS and the AXIS was spouting off incorrect information regarding event and then headed back to the room and decided to call down again. The room had already been changed and they wondered why we weren't in the new room but they had notes that no one had called us. Asked for the bellhop to be sent up immediately since we had to be back at the AXIS at 730 pm, he upgraded the room to an 100 extra square feet and it took 45 minutes to get the bellman up. The new room had tape on the ceiling and clothing stickers everywhere and the tv was disconnected. As we were leaving, we realized the door didn't close from the outside. We made it work, and called when we got back about the TV and tape and door. Maintenance took care of the TV and then said the lock had to be replaced and they would do it tomorrow at noon. . . Tomorrow comes and nothing. Again we had to get to a show and no one came so we went out to our show and when we got back, our door was open. Apparently housekeeping came and took SOME of the tape off the ceiling but didn't realize the door didn't work and our room was open for hours. They came up and replaced the lock and I took down the rest of the tape, housekeeping that day left us with absolutely no toilet paper as well. . . Sunday was going well, but we discovered a table in our room that was supposed to light up, was broken. We then went out for Sunday's festivities. We were so happy, flying high, came to the room and our keys had been deactivated. Down the stairs we went and got new keys. Totally deflated our night. . . In the morning we got room service with a room credit they gave us. When I went to check out, the front desk said I had to pay for the room service service charge and I said no I don't and the manager reversed it and we left, or so i thought.. . I requested my hotel bills a couple days after returning home.  I was appalled at what happened.  First off, this room was prepaid through a third party.  On the bill, the first night was a charge for the upgrade of the room, that we had already said we didn't want.  They didn't refund the credit card, they just credited my account for the $250.  Everything else was on the up and up, except at the end there was a $15.10 room service charge.  I called Planet Hollywood and they said there was no way they could have refunded that charge because it was gratuity.  I am upset because the manager who checked us out said, don't worry about it, you have a $0 bill.  Now they have that manager calling me back, even though they have told me nothing can be done.. . In all fairness, I was told nothing could be done to the room price because I booked through a third party.  I was issued a $50 food credit at the end of the second night, and a $75 credit on the last night.  Also 2 comped 2 WiFi devices at around midnight the last night of our stay (which gave us maybe 4 hours of use, if you account for sleep time.) But I am still appalled at how much time I wasted on my trip on dealing with room problems. The whole thing could have been solved by just moving us to a different upgraded room and not charging the upgrade fees.. . Buffet was nothing to write home about, valet was super slow (even the valet said, "wow you've been waiting a long time!) at various times not just at rush hours, bell service was the best thing at this hotel.
Definitely need more staff at front desk, only two people with like 50 people in line. Otherwise great stay: nice room, great service , nice view!
Pretty good place to stay. I was here on a weeknight for business and the price was right. The parking structure is a walk but if you're here for pleasure that's probably not an issue. However, having to run in 110 degree weather to get to my car for a meeting in south Vegas is a pain though! . . Service was excellent and staff were very friendly. There was a very nice gentleman near the casino elevators that spa seers questions and provides directions. The only issue I had was that when I arrived to my room, I noticed the hallway was filled with cigarette smoke and my room smelled like five gallons of rubbing alcohol was spilled in it that morning. A simple room change and all was better.
Came in town for a weekend to celebrate a couple birthdays. I had booked a basic two queen non-smoking room a month in advance, and adding an extra night to the reservation was quick and easy over the customer service rep over the phone.. .  Valet was convenient as we had a lot of luggage, ice cooler, and snacks. We arrived on a Thursday night at 11:30 pm and there was a long line to check-in. Fortunately, the line moved quickly.. . I did the $100 trick, in hopes to upgrade to a suite. The employee searched the system diligently for a good 10 minutes, but apparently they were all booked that weekend and the only upgrade available was a room with a strip view. Boo.... . They were still able to honor my request for connecting rooms with my friends.. . Pros:. - Spacious. - Hot tub + shower. . Cons:. - No vanity mirror for the ladies. - No fridge. - No bathroom fan. - Bottle opener costs $5.19 via room service
Despite the clean rooms and the relatively central location, I had a few issues with this hotel: . . In 110 degree heat, there were no water stations anywhere either inside the hotel or, worse yet, by the pool. My friend was even told to hike it to a drinking fountain when she asked one of the poolside servers for a water. There are limited drinking fountains tucked far away by the bathrooms. I'm assuming the hotel wants people drinking alcohol only or paying $10 for a bottle of water which is basically promoting dehydration, and quit frankly, bulltshit. Bottom-line: they are not looking out for the well-being of their guests. . . Bath Products - the "pleasure shampoo, conditioner, and soap" is vomit-inducing and smells like cotton-candy flavored perfume I wore in middle school. Absolutely disgusting. . . We went to Planet Dailies, the diner on site, twice for breakfast and it was surprisingly pretty great food with equally great service. I ordered a pina colada by the pool, on the other hand, which was over-priced and so disgustingly sweet I could barely suck it down. . . The casino wreaks of smoke and the casino bar serves ridiculously over-priced drinks. The pool is pretty lack-luster, located on the 6th floor rooftop above the casino, where there is virtually zero shade or trees, making the heat worse. Overall, there is nothing special about this hotel. I wouldn't stay here again.
This has the Magnificent Mile shops as part of its attraction so if you like shopping or window shopping that's about the only thing that differentiates this from some of the other casinos.. . The slot machines are older than New York New York and some of the other casinos which means they're more boring and really don't pay out enough to keep you even moderately interested.  The waitresses with the free drinks are pretty slow and not the most pleasant.
This hotel was nice enough and clean. The pool is great, although you have to pay a fortune for any decent lounge chairs that have shade which is a must in the Vegas heat. The drinks and food are also ridiculously expensive by the pool, as in $15 for an average sized cocktail. The staff by the pool is great and they are incredibly helpful, which was refreshing. The restaurants we tried in the hotel had the worst service I have ever received which was a huge disappointment. We will never dine at this hotel again. Also, the guy who initially checked us in clearly didn't know what he was doing so it took us a solid half an hour just to check in. We would stay here again, but will probably try another hotel first.
