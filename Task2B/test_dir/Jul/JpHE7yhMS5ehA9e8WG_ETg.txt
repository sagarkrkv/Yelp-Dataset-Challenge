Be prepared to be treated like royalty here! My bf & I recently stayed at Palazzo last month which we loved, but after staying at Aria's tower suite for EDC weekend, Aria is our new favorite hands down. It's a huge suite and we got the 2nd highest floor on the building (53rd floor) w/ a gorgeous view of the pools, cosmo, and vdara.. . Check in was a breeze and the staff were very welcoming. The tower suite was so awesome, lights turned on automatically when walking into the room. I like that they also have 2 fridges in the room. 1 is free to use to store your food/drinks like at Rio, the other is pre-filled w/ beverages etc and it will charge you if you take it. There are 2 bathrooms in here, 1 in the living room and the other in the master bedroom. The bedroom is frickin awesome! The king bed was really big, plush, and comfy, but they need new colored sheets cause the brown isn't very romantic LOL. There were lots of pillows and they were goose feathered which I love because it's so soft. Anyway, the bathroom in the bedroom is so cool w/ dual sinks, a nice jet bathtub, huge showers w/ a giant seat inside, AND the best toilet ever. Yes, the TOILET PEOPLE. It's like one of those toilets in Japan that washes your butt for you!!! It was our first time using it and I really wanna get one in the house now hahah. It even has a seat warmer on the toilet and you can adjust the temperature. . -There's tv's in the living room, bedroom, and bathroom. It was nice to be in the jet bath tub w/ bath salts watching tv. -They provide toothbrush & shaving kits here!. -The lotion, shampoo, body washes were good quality. Didn't leave my skin feeling dry. Loved the green tea citrus shampoo!!. . The room is very high-tech, loved that the little "ipad" by the bed controls the ENTIRE suite, not just the bedroom. It controls the temperature, tv's, lighting in the restrooms both in the bedroom and living room, etc. The a/c filtration system in here works beautifully, never felt dry or anything like at the cheaper hotels. I loved the bathrobes and slippers provided as well. We used the fitness facility and pools which were really clean. The fitness facility had everything your local 24/LA fitness would have EXCEPT stair masters :( They provide you w/ towels and water bottles as well as apples at the gym here. Next to the gym is a nice fireplace area that you can chill at, it's really tranquil. The pools are are great, we got to soak up sun w/out being bothered w/ lil kids running around. The jacuzzi was bigger than the typical normal circular ones. It was more like a big oval, which was nice 'cause I like my space and it didn't get as hot. There are multiple pools here and the crowd is more mature.. . I love that everytime we call for room service/front desk they greet us by our last name. Speaking of which, the room service here is fast. Another nice gesture is we told the front desk it was our anniversary and they surprised us by having room service give us complimentary ammenities! I seriously felt so pampered here, the room was clean and free of any bugs. I highly recommend Aria because of the great location, professional service, and 5 star rooms. It's really relaxing coming back to this comfy suite, it was sort of like going home.
I was excited to stay here because it's one of the newer hotels so I assumed it would be very nice. To my surprise it was a nightmare for me. . Check-in was long and they were having complications with their system. There's nothing worse than a long check-in when you are ready to go see your room and have some fun. . . Getting to the room it was nice, but the first think I noticed was a flickering light bulb when you first walk in. I let house keeping know and she said she would send someone right away. I said that's fine let themselves in.(we were going to the pool). . The next thing usually besides checking the bathroom is checking out your view. It wasn't a bad view, the window was just sooo freaking dirty. I don't even know how it could be so dirty as if someone poured something liquid out of a window. So that was aggravating.. .  We shortly decided To go to the pool where they tried to charge my guy friend 20 bucks! I don't know if we went to the wrong pool or whAt, but we told them we had a room key and they still said guys are 20 girls are free.. We didn't pay, we just walked right in. Why would we pay? We are staying there!. . Later on we go back to the room and the light is STILL flickering. What the heck!? It's been hours! And it's one of the lights that is connected to a couple more, so if that one is off the hallway is very dark. So no light. . . I noticed the phone in the bathroom was dusty, so I started looking around the room and everything was freaking dusty! The nightstand was the most dusty I could write in it. And then, the lamp shade was stained. On BOTH sides. It was disgusting!!!!! I don't even know, I don't even want to know. . . So I called concierge and I was pretty mad, they said they could send someone up to clean it right away and someone to change the light bulb. Thy told me they could not comp my stay or give me a new room because they were "booked". By this time it was later in the evening and I wanted to go out. So I sated forget it I just want 3 free buffets. So we got them and it was delicious! I do love me some buffet. A few days later I noticed they charged me for the freaking buffets. So I called and if course I wanted my money back blah blah. And finally today I received it back. I even wanted to stay an extra night in Vegas, but all they could do was charge me a room for $80. I was like uh no. Not here. . I specifically made a yelp so I can share my experience here. It's my first review and I will never, ever stay at aria again. Too many issues and even more AFTER I left.  . . Oh yeah and there was glass on the floor when I went to the buffet. Someone could have definitely "slipped and fell". . . You would think for being a newer hotel it would be a little more clean, but it was actually pretty beat up. Even the elevator buttons are all dinged up. I'm sure people have had great times here. I've seen such good reviews about Aria, but my time was not the best for me.
Modern hotel but it feels like an airport inside.  Loud music all day and all night long.  I don't mind it too much as we think we are pretty hip. Long line at poker room.  The service is inconsistent.  The porter lady who helped is was friendly and the porter to the room was super nice ( trained us on the complicated room controls). The valet team was always in a bad mood all 3 days we stayed here.  Maybe because it was 113 degrees outside.  The front desk and cashier areas were super understaffed with long lines.  Overall a good hotel with good rates.  Definitely far from the best hotels in Vegas which remain Wynn and Encore.
Room was nice, in spite of being a long long walk to get to.  Check in was unacceptably slow, almost an hour; check out was a bit better but not by much. . Then come the billing issues. Waiting on hold forever only to have them pass the buck and blame the bank for not processing a "refund" quickly enough (I thought maybe they shouldn't have made the error in the first place, but they definitely wouldn't accept any responsibility or try to remedy the situation.) Such a drag and totally unnecessary. Ruined an otherwise nice, not great, stay.
The room is nice. However, there is no refrigerator! Even a three-star hotel has one. I can't believe this so-called five star hotel doesn't have it! Will never come again!
I have stopped in most of the hotels on the strip and this one tops them all. Cosmopolitan ran it close but the pool options, rooms and pleasant staff means Aria edges it. . . The drinks at the pools are expensive but it's a 5 star hotel and it's Vegas but the atmosphere is first class plus free entry into Liquid for hotel guests. . . Thank you Aria I will be back!!
Definitely the nicest casino in Vegas. Yes, even better than the Venetian and the Bellagio.. . I love to play poker at the Aria. The atmosphere is absolutely gorgeous! And there is always 20+ tables going on the weekends (and long wait times to boot; but who wouldn't want to play here?). . Rooms are expensive, but hey, luxury isn't cheap.
This is a nice hotel only because its brand spanking new. I've been twice and it's already aging: the room control screen in our last room wasn't working, the mattress was getting saggy, and the plumbing was making noise. Also, its just not that nice after you really experience it for a few days. There's no where to eat outside (on those rare pleasant Las Vegas mornings that you really should try to take advantage of). The pool has limited hours, and you're not allowed to bring outside food or drink out there anyway. It's downright tacky the lengths that the hotel will go to to prevent you from bringing in outside food (including the staffer interrogating the family with a newborn about whether they were trying to sneak in baby food). They have no recycling or water conservation policy that we could find. And, worst of all, the internet really didn't work. For a pricier hotel, we had much higher expectations.
I am so angry about this hotel. I booked the panorama room two month ago for my birthday party. When I arrived the hotel they said they did not have this room and gave me a lower quality room. How can we did not get the room we want if we booked two month ago?! And they did not tell us anything while we arrived the hotel. How can they treat the customer like this.
My friend book a panorama room for her 21 B-day party, but when we arrived to the hotel, the room they gave to my friend are totally not match what my friend suppose to have. My friend have been book the room like month ago, and now they just said the room have already been book by another person! What the H! They didn't give any notification during this time,  they just gave us an other low quality room!the service quality is extremely bad to my friend, we are not satisfy on it! Never come to this hotel again!!!
I booked a panorama room 2 months ago for my 21 birthday. When I arrived and checked in, the staffs said the panorama rooms were full and were not available, there was no other excuses. They offered me a much smaller room and returned $100 to me. I got really pissed off,I didn't get any emails and notices before. After it, I talked with the managers, and they just said sorry and that's it. What the hell is this service quality?
Stayed here during EDC weekend for the first time. It's nice an a lot classier then most hotel. From the hotel itself to the employees to even the guest. . . Ambiance: nice dark and gloomy. Smells sweet without overwhelmingly scented. Exact opposite of Cosmopolitan, both are very nice new and updated however Cosmo's ambiance is louder. Personally gives me a headache and the scent is much stronger, I think of the color pink when it comes to Cosmo. . . Room: It definitely isn't cheap to stay. The room was a lot nicer then what I was expecting. It was spacious, everything was electronically controlled. The restroom was amazing. I absolutely love the bath and shower combo. No fridge for you to sore drink because it's censored. . . Casino: cool big have all the new a lot machines . . Food: expensive but plenty to choose from. . Store: 24hr store to buy almost everything you need or forget. Meds, pads, exlax haha. . Cons: it's kind of far from the center strip. Not bad but a definite walk. . . Pro: room rates include valet however I have a DUI start so I had to park my car and there is a big parking structure that is a short-ish walk to the hotel so definitely is cool.
The rooms are fantastic!  Modern, clean, and spacious.  Can't beat it!  You walk in the curtains open up automatically.  You can set them up to wake up with them opening up vs. an alarm clock!  Now that is a hangover remedy.  The lobby, restaurants, location are all amazing.  Enjoy now before it becomes and after thought like all the casino's due at one point.. . Tips...during busy check ins...you could wait longer than going through security check point at an airport!  During check out...if you see the line...do the express check out...will save you some wrinkles and not ruin your vacation.
I dont understand why Aria is 3 and a half stars? It should be at least 5! Second time I'm staying there, and I don't think I can ever stay anywhere else.. . First lets start with the location, right smack in the middle of everything. The city center is so modern and nice, to me its the staple to Las Vegas. Everywhere I went it was either walking distance or I would grab a taxi and it was never over a 10 dollar tab to get where you want to.. . Second you valet your car, and walk into Aria, its so nice and clean you know you get your moneys worth staying at a nicer hotel. . . The reason why I wanted to write this review was specifically because of Michael who works in the Check In/Concierge area. I literally was 5 dollars short on the card since they hold $130 a night on your card, and he literally saved me from being a debbie downer. Pretty much helped me out with everything and was sooooooo kind! All I know is that if I'm going to check in Aria in the future, If i have to wait for an hour to get him to help me check in, I will!. . Let's get to the room! Modern, chic, and big! I love the technology style room! Can control the room lighting, TV, air conditioning, and curtains with this digital control screen. The bathroom is nice, love the double sinks! My favorite part funny enough is the mattress. I literally slept like a baby! It was as if I was sleeping on clouds! . . The customer service anywhere in Aria is great! Everyone is so nice and helpful.. . I just can't wait unit my next trip to Las Vegas!
Stayed at Aria for the second time during 4th of July weekend in the deluxe room.  Valet was quick and easy.  Check in as well, although the line did grow significantly after me.  Front desk was kind and courteous however $20 trick didn't work, she was able to "upgrade" me from a regular deluxe room to the mountain view room which was nice, I tipped her but less than the $20 since it wasn't a different room upgrade.  Elevator's were extremely quick, did not have to wait long to get to the room or downstairs.  . . Room:. The room was extremely clean and modern.  I would not say that it feel's luxurious, but definitely felt more so than others.  We did have trouble with the toilet flushing but the service man was at our room extremely quickly and the flush was just unhinged so it was a simple fix.  The mountain view was very nice, we were able to enjoy a nice sunset view, as well as an awesome fireworks display across the dessert during the 4th.  We were able to see the entire dessert lit up with fireworks from a far.  Touchscreen controls were convenient for operating the lights/shades, however it was annoying to operate the TV.  I preferred using the regular remote.  The Aria has one of the nicer showers of the resorts I have stayed at.  The water pressure and temperature were great, and there is also a bath tub inside the same room as the shower, you can create a sauna type experience.. . Location:. Extremely good location with short walks to the City Center, Cosmopolitan, Planet Hollywood, and a free tram that connects you to Monte Carlo (with NYNY nearby), or to the Bellagio (where you can walk to Caesar's Palace).  Tram's are usually there within 15 min of each other.  . . Pool:. There were 3 pools at the Aria, not including Liquid Dayclub.  The pool area wasn't as nice as the MGM or even the Monte Carlo, but it was big, seemed to have a lot of greenery and umbrellas for shade, and was easy to grab some chairs in the afternoon.  You would think a brand new resort would have a pool area more comparable to the other high end resorts but it was definitely acceptable to lounge around and relax at.. . Food:. Plenty of high end restaurants, although limited on cheaper and late night eats.  Jean Philippe Patisserie is a great place to pick up a crepe, pastries or gelato, but it is pricey and is not 24 hours.  The only "cheap" places to eat would be the 24 hour cafe or the pizza place, however the cafe does not have great reviews.  You can always walk nearby to the Cosmo to Secret Pizza or across the street to the Planet Hollywood for Earl's.  Plenty of bars and places to lounge and a drink as well, though there was a line at The Deuce bar/lounge for the UFC fight.. . Gambling:. For this trip me and my gf enjoyed the slots.  We had a good run but in the end the house always wins, but we did enjoy ourselves and service was very attentive in bringing us drinks.. . All in all, Aria is a great place to stay on the strip for modern and clean rooms, great location, and a nice new resort to enjoy.  I would definitely return again. Depending on the price, you may be able to shell out a bit more and stay at what I would consider the more luxurious resorts (Wynn/Encore, Bellagio, Venetian/Palazzo).  Also, as an M life member you do seem to get better rates than expedia.com.  I seemed to be getting rates that were $20-$30 cheaper a night so sign up and take advantage of that, even at the beginning Sapphire level.
Is currently my fav hotel to stay at in Vegas.  People don't believe me but it literally smells better at this resort than any other property in Vegas.  I don't know how to explain it but when you walk in, you get this fresh scent of oxygen that relaxes you.  . . The rooms are modern and upscale.  Very comfortable and kept up to high standards.  The service is friendly and if you ever need anything they respond quickly.    The property is absolutely gorgeous and I can't wait until I get to stay here again.  You can just tell a difference when you enter this place and I am a Vegas veteran.
I stayed at the Aria for my honeymoon and we check in yesterday but the experience has been so great, I had to review it today even though our stay is not yet over. . . When we got to check in Heather was amazing! She tried to accommodate us as best as she could, and even got us an update to a nicer, larger room on floor 32. As soon as we opened the door, all the curtains opened and we had this amazing view of the city. The bathroom is huge with separate shower and bathtub/whirlpool, the latter overlooking the strip. . . The bed and pillows, so comfortable. Ok minibar selection. The room is kind of high tech and I enjoy and appreciate being able to close all the curtains and turn of all the lights by touching a sensor without having to leave the bed. . . Before coming to the Aria I had read mixed reviews but I must say I am very impressed.
We usually stay at the Luxor. But, on a recent trip to celebrate my birthday, we decided to splurge and stay at the Aria (which we thought would be the classiest hotel in Vegas with rooms that have the best views). . . Our room was lovely, but we were extremely disappointed when we noticed right away that the windows were filthy. It seemed that the outside of the windows had not been cleaned in a long time. We have traveled all over the US and the world and we have never had filthy windows in our hotel rooms. What a shock to find dirty windows at the Aria! What a terrible impression that made on us. . . Then when we went to use the shower, we noticed right away that the water was collecting quickly and not draining. We were standing in a deep pool of water.almost up to our ankles. We realized that the shower floor is completely flat, so the water does not drain. The shower just keeps filling up. When you shut off the water, the water starts to drain very slowly, but it never drains completely. A pool of water still remains. The next person to shower has to step in a pool of chilly water. In all of our travels, we have never seen such a poorly designed shower floor. Common sense tells you that the shower floor should be somewhat sloped to allow the water to pour down to allow the water to drain on its own. Our shower at the Aria should have come with a squeegee for the shower floor so we could force the water to the drain. I ended up pushing the water toward the drain with my feet. What a shock that the Aria has the worst shower we ever used! . . We were also very disappointed in the way the mini-bar operates. Other hotels have allowed us to remove items from the refrigerator so we could put our own items in like bottled water. The Aria mini-bar is scary -- it knows what you are doing. We were afraid to even look at anything in the mini-bar because we might be charged for it. . . Also, the ironing board is absolutely ridiculous! The largest part of the board is used for storing the iron! There is a metal iron holder permanently attached to that part of the board making it completely useless. And when you put the board away you have to be very careful or you could bang the sharp metal holder into your shin. There was no need to reinvent the ironing board. If you have to iron a dress (especially a long one), the iron holder makes it an almost impossible job.. . On a positive note.... the view at night (despite the dirty windows) was awesome! We especially liked the view of the wonderful hotel fountain with dancing waters (unfortunately the fountain was down for repair for most of our stay). We liked the drapes (blackout & sheer). Our favorite restaurant is Julian Serrano -- we ate dinner there twice! We also like Javier's. We loved having dessert at Jean Phillipe, The Aria staff were always very friendly and welcoming. . . We will definitely visit the Aria again (we love to walk around the hotel and enjoy the public features). But I'm doubtful that we will ever stay at the Aria again.  Someone told us that the Aria is changing ownership or management. If this is true, I certainly hope that some positive changes will be made to bring the quality of the hotel rooms up to the highest standards.
I had the chance to stay at the Aria during a business trip. I have to say it was very nice. Everything was automated. The blinds opened and the TV greeted me when I first walked in. The bath was nice and the restaurants were great. I especially enjoyed the Thai restaurant.  . . It was a bit far from the strip so the British pub was the go to place. In addition, it was close to a number of stores.
First the good:  high tech room with a fantastic view.  Control everything through tv including lights and curtains.  Bath was nice, although shower had no pressure.  Fairly quiet, only heard neighbors once, at 5 am of course. . . Not great: The bed was way too soft and pillows useless. One lamp was broken, one of the two sinks clogged, tv remote would not work from the bed...needed batteries?.  There was also a smell of smoke in the room. I am guessing the neighbors.. . The bad: We booked a package with two free buffets.  When I checked in I asked about them and was told it was a buffet credit, not free buffets.  She said that meant we had a food credit of $65 and could get lunch the first day and use the rest toward breakfast the next. So that was the plan.  Long story short, I checked my balance and was told the buffet credit was a one time use only so the extra we saved by choosing lunch and skipping drinks went to waste.  I asked to speak with the manager but the young lady spoke with him and said there was nothing her could do.  She was nice, but didn't fix the problem.  I did not want to be "that guy" but I am guessing that being polite did not help me in this situation. . . With so many hotel choices I would have thought this hotel would have wanted to fix the problem so we would recommend the hotel or return.  Sadly, we wont do either.  Customer service goes a long way.
Went to the ARIA for the WPT500. Overall experience was very good. Excellent restaurants and staff.
Second too none. This casino will be here 40 years from now and appear new and great as the first day.
Me and a couple of friends stayed here in the corner suite w/city view and it was beautiful! The living room was just your ordinary, and so was the bedroom but the bathroom was my favorite part. A whirl pool tub was located near the window facing the city center and a flat screen tv was also located straight ahead so it was a great place to relax. There was also a separate shower and enclosed toilet area. . . I found the tablet(where you can control everything) useless because they also had buttons and switches that your normally used to, to control everything in the room as well. . . One thing I like about this hotel was that the staff was friendly and the check in line moved fairly fast. Also, the self parking garage was great because they have a lot of parking stalls though the walk to the hotel rooms are quite a hassle. . . And another tip, just like any other valet service be sure to call in for your car before going down because the waits ridiculous! The other valet ( not sure if it was the north or west) but on the less busier side of the hotel would be your best bet if you aren't self parking.
We absolutely love this place! Luxurious and high tech rooms- the best feature is that you can open/close curtains with one button. The "good night" button also turns off all lights in addition to closing the curtains. The viewsfrom the rooms are expansive- whether you're looking out on city center or the desert. . . The pools are also amazing. It's mainly an adult scene, though there are a few kids. It's very laid back and serene. The staff maintains it well- cocktail waitresses and staff refilling the water coolers are frequent.. . The restaurants are also high-end and don't disappoint.. . The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of interesting slot machines and the drink prices.  Slots are pretty stodgy and basic. Table limits are often at least $15 per hand/roll, though this should probably be expected in a nice hotel like this. The drink prices at the pool are too high- $18 for their most popular drink- a mojito (though they are quite good).. . We'll continue to stay here as it's out favorite hotel- we just have to budget for it!
Nice ambiance and good bar service. Tipping goes a long ways. Our glasses were never empty. Jerry at the roulette table was fun. Definitely will be returning for more roulette!
Stains.  That is what I found on the furniture in the room they initially tried to give me.. . None.  Is the amount of housekeeping on one of the three nights I spent here.. . None.  Is the amount of service I received at Lift Bar after waiting 20 minutes.. . MLife Desk = Ruuuuude.  "Didn't I already help you?". . Black Jack Dealers: 25% awesome; 25% really good; 15% acceptable; 35% lifeless and/or rude. . Front Desk: "I can't hear you unless you flash some cash."
No good... I booked 4 rooms with a special price. However, I don't think this is a good deal when I arrived. There are my bad experience below:. . 1. We were given wrong information about the promotion policy by the front desk staff.    - The promotion deal is including buffet when we book a room, the front desk staff said $30 is enough for dinner buffet in this hotel, it is not true.. - If we charge the buffet fee into the hotel room, it will be no tax for the dinner. This is totally wrong information.. - 2 nights credit can be combined together. It is also not true.. **The misleading information cost us extra charges and time.. . 2. The front desk staff gave us a disable room without inform us when we checking in. . . 3. The restroom door in the is broken.  . . 4. The private light is broken (I don't realize on the first night), the janitor came into our room in the morning before we go out.
I admit it, I'm cheap. Not like "oh, I'm going to wait for this to go on sale" cheap, but more so like "oh, this is on sale, but I'm going to wait for it to get marked down and then I'll buy it if I have a coupon" cheap.. . Being this much of a bargain hunter has its advantages... 1) I can then afford to stay at places like Aria, and 2) when I find a deal at Aria I'm even happier. We scored a great price on our room via hotels.com, and it came with a $75 food/beverage credit that we happily spent during happy hour at Julian Serrano. . . From check-in to check-out, everyone we encountered was super friendly... from the valet to the front desk to the housekeeping staff. Our room was on the 15th floor and faced the strip... the shower/tub in the room was a-freaking-mazing, I could not believe the water pressure in the shower! It practically shoved me against the wall, amazing. Everything about this room was so nice... the pillows, oh man, those pillows. I'm definitely considering buying some to have at home! The softest bed I've ever slept on, I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. Electronic window controls, fancy lighting controls, all around excellent. The wi-fi even worked perfectly in our room.. . The pool was so nice and relaxing (3 to choose from, in addition to a few different hot tubs). My small complaint there is that the restroom for the pool is a mile away, and that the depth of the pools is only 3 feet or so. But we had no problem getting a good spot and there were no screaming kids running around, so you gotta love that. The casino itself is the least smoky of all the ones we hung out in, maybe the smoke is just covered up by that distinct "Aria" scent, or maybe they have great ventilation. Either way, it's appreciated.. . If I can find a good price on Aria next time I visit Vegas, I will definitely be staying there again.
The center suite in Aria is the best room I've stayed in so far in LV.  We were up on the 52nd floor and the panoramic view was unbelievable.  You could see airplanes land and depart.  At night, the view gets even better.  If you have the right amount of income or tons of reward points, the view by itself is worth it.  . . The room was crispy clean when we entered.  With the suite, you get a bath and a shower.  The bathroom is huge and well lit.  Almost as big as the living space.  I wish I had taken the chance to take a bath with the view of the city.  Sigh.  Now, the bed is insanely comfortable.  It's the closest thing to sleeping on a cloud.  Probably the most comfortable alcohol induced sleep I ever had.  If you have a big party, you could also ask for a cot, since the suite only had a king size bed.  . . I love Aria.  Definitely get the suite on a high floor.
This is my favorite Las Vegas hotel. Coming here is like coming home. It appeals to my husband and I on so many levels. The atmosphere, the smell, the rooms, the food, the drinks! The only negative is that I never win any money here!. . Our last stay was in a Corner Suite. This room went beyond my expectations. This is a premium room that isn't outrageously priced (and believe me, it can get outrageous at this hotel)! The bed was the most comfortable thing I had every slept in. And the floor to ceiling windows in every room (even the bathroom!) were gorgeous and gave a great view of the strip. I loved the views. The two bathrooms were appreciated, as was the bidet. I know, I like fancy like that. Twice daily housekeeping was a nice touch too.. . OMG the food at this hotel is just amazing. Sage is always our favorite (see my review for that spot) but the tapas restaurant was a nice experience as well. . . Oh Aria, we will be back soon!
Incredible lack of attention to detail. We requested early check in, got it for one of our rooms. The other wasn't ready, but we were told it would be ready by 3pm. Okay, fine. So we go down to the pool and go back up to our one room around 530. The other room STILL isn't ready. The hotel tells us the past guests decided to stay so they moved us to a different room.... Which, upon entry, WAS NOT CLEANED. There was a subway sandwich left in the room from a previous guest... GROSS. The mini bar wasn't stocked. We had to ask four times for the hotel to send us our complimentary bachelorette gift. Like seriously... Clean up. . . Besides the disaster that was checking in, the hotel was nice. Cabana was great. Casino smelled good, not stale smokey. . . However, I don't think id stay here again. Not worth the price, at all.
LOVE this place!! Can't wait to go back. Gorgeous rooms and excellent service! Not to mention the fabulous dining options.
Going downhill! We stayed here 2 years ago and it was amazing. Now there's no attention to detail. Common spaces aren't as clean, lifeguards on their cell phones, protruding cracks in the cement around the pool. Sad.
What a joke. I reserved a non-smoking room and on arrival was informed they only had smoking rooms available. The room reeked of cigarette smoke and the staff was not accommodating at all. I would expect much better service from a "high end" hotel. Save your money and book with another hotel.
I'm a hotel whore.  Incidentally in Vegas once or twice a year, I delight in trying new hotels.  I have no loyalty to any hotel, brand or amenity.  . . This may have all changed.  Meeting a girlfriend in Vegas to celebrate my birthday, she chose to stay at The Aria so I stayed there too to make things easier. . . Oh, the joys of a modern hotel.  Visible and easily accessible plugs on the nightstand for my phone and Kindle.  A nightstand safe for laptops that is super easy to operate.  A nightstand control panel for damn near everything in my room. Lots of nooks and crannies for storage, suitcases, etc.  Curtains that open and close at the touch of a switch.  No more fumbling with the privacy card as it's just a push of a button.  The complimentary toiletries are NICE (nicer than the ones I brought so I may be squirreling them away for home use).   . . I got a fantastic summer rate, they gave me a birthday room upgrade and they hotel delivered a lovely box of macarons to my room.. . The room of beautifully decorated and the bed.. oh, the bed... it will swallow you whole.  I don't have plans until this afternoon so I sit cheerfully on my comfy bed, doing a bit of work and enjoying the gorgeous view.  . . My room is quiet and the blackout curtains do a wonderful job of letting me sleep when I want to sleep.  . . There are a couple areas they could improve:  . . Check-in was dreadfully slow.  I probably waited in line for a half hour.  (To be fair, it was exacerbated by a five hour plane delay...I was quite tired of waiting by that point.). . As it hasn't been convenient to go shopping and buy bottled water, I've been drinking water out of the tap and it's akin to Phoenix water.  I'm reluctantly staying hydrated.  . . The mini-fridge that is stocked to the gills with room for nothing else is irritating (although standard Vegas).  You can request another fridge be delivered to your room but that seems silly.  Just leave me a shelf.     . . The disinfectant they use distinctly reminds me of my great grandmother's nursing home.  It's a little off putting but only because I have that association. . . I'm here one more night and it's been a lovely, lovely stay so far.  I'm trying to decide if my family would miss me if I didn't come home...
Terrific staff, excellent hotel. Our first encounter with Aria was the valet: Very professional, and a terrific a sense of humor. At check-in we dealt with a woman named Crystal that was very friendly and helpful. Our stay was short, but very enjoyable. We'll be back.
This is a wonderful hotel. I loved it and here's why:. Comfort: the mattress and bedding were amazing! Modern and stylish design. The modern push button lighting was confusing but there is a master button to turn everything off. . Value: everything is expensive here, but if you pack well it helps. There is a walgreens nearby; I suggest shopping there for water and essentials. . Service: exceptional! Housekeeping especially. I want to write a letter in fact. I was so pleased with especially one, Tyiesa. She turned my room for me when I was feeling sick. What a wonderful person!! . Cabanas: awesome deal on the weekdays! $200 gets you a server in your own private area for the whole day. It is stocked with waters and snacks and fruit and vegetables. . Check in: fast and efficient.. Check out: a breeze! . Convenience: centrally located on the strip.. We would visit here again for sure!
I came here in May for my best friend's quickie Elvis wedding. This was my first time going to Las Vegas. I don't gamble, I'm not into clubs, I don't really go to shows, and although I love booze paying $15 for a drink makes me sad. So basically, Vegas should be pointless to me in theory. Although I can't compare it to other Strip hotels I liked Aria for my quick weekend trip. Aria doesn't have tigers, canals, volcanos, the Eiffel Tower, or ginormous water fountains like some of the other guys do, but, that's what cruising the Strip is for. Aria is just a straight up a modern and sleek place and it's not too far from all the over the top hotels that are fun to check out. . . I arrived on a Friday night around 11:30, after my flight was delayed for an hour (THANKS OBAMA! He was literally the reason why my flight was delayed as he was leaving where my flight originated from, so all air traffic was grounded for a 100 mile radius until he left). Although there was a line, check in was a breeze and I was on my way to my room within 10 minutes. I was only on the 8th floor, but, I still had a pretty decent partial view of the Strip and the mountains off in the distance. My room was clean, the floor I was on was quiet, the robes were soft, and the bed was super comfy with a mountain of pillows to nestle in. . . The only things I didn't like about my room was the crazy motion sensitive mini bar/fridge. It detects when things are moved and will charge you for the item, meaning, you can't refrigerate any leftovers or snacks you brought on your own. I also disliked the terrible ironing board as mentioned by another reviewer. I spent 45 minutes attempting to iron my tea length bridesmaid dress, the built in iron holder was a huge pain in the ass to work around. . . Here are my tips:. . Be sure to turn on the privacy light when you're in your room even if you think you'll be out of your room early. Housekeeping comes earlier! With my room being so blissfully quiet I was scared awake by them ringing my doorbell in the morning and it was definitely before 9 am. That was pretty much the only sound I heard in my room during my entire stay.. . Aria is on a huge property that is part of the City Center. Expect for it to take a million years to get across the property. If you're lazy or easily disorientated, maybe stick to hanging out at the Lift Bar. It's right next to the guest elevator banks that go to the rooms. Lift Bar has a lounge singer, it's a prime spot for people watching and it's open 24 hours. Within the hotel there is a little convenience/gift store that sells a variety of items. With that being said, there is a CVS outside the hotel which surprisingly has normal prices and is probably an equal walking distance away if you're leaving from your room. Go to CVS, buy several bottles of water that don't cost $8 each, you'll need them (the tap water tastes weird). . . Also, since it takes awhile to get around if you find it's 10:57 am and check out is 11:00 am you can conveniently check out using your phone. I did that so I could take advantage of the buffet voucher I had enabling me to enjoy brunch without worrying about making the check out time. This option was simple and I didn't experience any problems with it.
What an experience.  So far this is the nicest hotel we have stayed at in Vegas. Fourth time here. Love the city. Fr the casino to the rooms. They left out no small details. The room is fully automated. The lights, the curtains, the A/C, the tv all controlled with an handheld device. It's very nice to wake up in the morning to the curtains opening the tv playing music and the A/C kicking in extra cold. I'll be back...........
I really enjoyed my stay at the Aria. World class amenities and the rooms are very classy. Check inwas smooth, I recommend entering on the city center side instead of the Harmon street entrance. Got a room with a nice pool view. As you first walk-in the black out shades part ways and the lights rise; leaves you in awe. Everything is plush, super soft king with an elegant bathroom.. . The casino is a bit overwhelming for those not that experienced like me, $25 min bet blackjack tables and I didn't even go through the poker spots. But, overall its really fun. The cafe downstairs has an amazing cinnamon roll. Plus all the staff is friendly and attentive. . . I probably wouldn't stay here again because I feel you get more bang for your buck at the smoke free Vdara Hotel across the way. However, if you like to gamble this is great.
I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience at Aria. I was just simply trying to ask where to pick up my mlife card at the guest service desk or something. That guy was trying to give me directions to the mlife place but ended up just printing out my mlifecard for me and even decided to check me in (my bf was like the 90th person in line), i just glad to have just saved so much time and trouble thanks to this guy's helpfulness. I appreciate good service so much. . . I love every single thing about the room. The bed, pillows, and blanket was softer/comfier than other hotels. The bathroom layout is cool too. Everything was nice and new. Loved that you can control the curtains and lights from the tablet next to the bed. . . 5 star for sure!
I LOVE this hotel! Customer Service is excellent!!! They really know how to handle the customers and makesure you're comfortable. I would've have it 5 stars if I in-room dining was nicer when asking for silverware. I called to get a fork and I guy (wish I had gotten his name) told me it would be a $1.25/per item brought up. I needed 3 forks. I told him I would come down and get it and he straight cut me off and told me No I couldn't. Well excuse me!!! Liquid pool was ok. You can tell who the broke people are because you have to pay to sit. So anybody standing around let's you Know they don't have money to pay for a cabana or a ottoman. They don't even have shade! The pool is super small too. Even to have a table at the bar is a minimum $250. Other than that the hotel is great! Very huge! Club Haze was great Saturday night. DJ could've been better. He played more house than hip hop and top 40. Food at the hotel is great especially the Aria Cafe!! Late night menu is very pricey but the quality of the food is excellent. Took the slippers home and left the robe since they wanted $75 for it LOL. Maybe for Christmas. I would love to stay here again one day. :)
The place is classy and i love the design it's high quality at it's best the best in the west and the service is very good
Beware! Shady practices if you use a debit card. I booked a room via hotels.com and prepaid the entire room. Upon checkin using a debit card they placed a hold for $260 on my card. Fine. All i should end up paying is the resort fees of $56. I checkout they charge my card for the entire $260! Why when all i owe them is $56 dollars?? Then two days later i call them and they tell me they issued a refund of the remaining amount. My bank which reflects things immediately if they are pending, shows nothing. They tell me it takes 3-7 days to show (BS). If they issued a credit back to my bank it would show pending in my account. I think they take the money hang on to it (as part of the bigger MGM portfolio) make money off it before returning it to the guest (i still have not received my refund and will be shortly filing a complaint in a few days with my bank if they do not return my funds). . . This is a hotel owned by the entire MGM hotels group and im sure all their hotels do this. Im not paying them to stay at their resort to fund their venture capitalist division. Will no longer stay at one of this chain's hotel.
We stayed at Aria in a Sky Suite for 4 days this month and must say that this was one of the best hotel stays we have had. We travel extensively (and have spent many nights in 5 star hotels) and found this experience to be most excellent. The check-in process was efficient. Era was attentive and made sure that she assisted in making this stay memorable by offering a complimentary upgrade and other tips - she was just wonderful! Our suite was quite well appointed and modern. We were on the 50th floor and had a fantastic view of the strip and airport. One of the best aspects of this hotel was housekeeping - this is something that I don't often comment about, but the housekeeping staff was so friendly and attentive. The room was serviced each morning and night and it was quite apparent that careful attention was paid to ensure that the room was in pristine condition. The staff would even ensure that my iPhone charger was neatly placed near the bed. They were always friendly and engaged with the hotel guests. . . We have visited the spa in the past and highly recommend a Spa Suite. We dined at Aria Cafe and had a very average experience. The dinner menu was limited and the service was a bit slow, but the food was good. We took advantage of the lounge and refreshments that are offered to the Sky Suite guests on a few occasions and enjoyed this. We had a car while in town and parked in the self park garage. We were always able to find a parking space and the walk into hotel wasn't excessive. WiFi was included and was fast enough that I could work efficiently.. . Overall, our stay was most excellent. We have stayed at several of the 5 star hotels on the strip and plan to return to the Aria for subsequent visits to Las Vegas because the accommodations, service, amenities and location simply can't compare with other hotel options on the strip.
We stayed at the Aria during spring of this year specifically for the convenience of seeing Zarkana (which was excellent by the way). This was the first time we stayed at the CityCenter-the hotel is walking distance to Vdara, Mandarin Oriental (which I think we want to stay next time...), Cosmo and the shopping areas.. . Rooms are pretty standard, but extremely clean and an excellent bathroom. Lotions and shampoos had a mix of lavender and cedar- nice.  Views are pretty amazing and although the hotel is typical Vegas huge, it still seemed manageable. The gym is absolutely amazing-state of the art everything-you have to walk through the spa area to get to the gym and the lavender smells are awesome.. . The restaurants are excellent (even the Buffet was pretty good-we had late breakfast there and it is quite international-very reasonable price too). For breakfast, I would go to the Buffet rather than the Aria Cafe if you like various breakfast meats, scrambled eggs, potatoes, dim sum and variety of pastries.  The food at Jean Georges Steakhouse was pretty amazing, despite the uppity waiter.  There is a STARBUCKS on the second level- loved the fact that the drinks were stronger (like they added an extra shot of espresso) and the scones were glazed and huge!. . I recommend that you call housekeeping prior to your sightseeing. It is  a huge hotel and it is best if you call housekeeping at least half an hour before you depart (especially if you like to take an afternoon nap in a clean and refreshed room).. . There were only a handful of kids:-) -very helpful to have a serene experience at the pool. The hotel is definitely kid-friendly but it really doesn't cater to the family of 5. A lot of couples and groups of friends.. . Great hotel!
The Aria lives up to its expectations and the decor is great. The room is very modern and up-to-date. The bed is very comfy and you can imagine the rest. This hotel provides a great view no matter which room you choose. If you are a party animal then ask the concierge to book you at Club Haze. No waiting in line and the club was packed. The Aria cafe is great for breakfast, but beware of the $7 orange juice, not worth it. I have stayed at both Vdara and Aria and both hotels are great.
Love this place! The rooms are awesome. It's pretty close to the center of the strip so you can walk both ways. The service is terrific. There's a CVS nearby to grab essentials. The watermelon juice is AMAZING! Love staying here!
I love this hotel! You can pay a little extra to check in early and check out late. The beds are incredibly comfortable. The rooms are quiet and have everything that you could need: hair dryer, robes, iron, hair products, etc. I like that the bathrooms are roomy enough for two people to get ready at the same time without hitting each other. When you leave the room for the day you can hit the "Service" button and they'll freshen up the room while you're out. There is a lot of room around the pool in the shade and in the sun. If you want a prime spot on a Saturday with an umbrella you should get to the pool by 10:30 at the latest. I highly recommend this hotel.
I use to think this place was the bees knees and relished the idea of returning. That honeymoon period is over....as in beat it with a stick, bury it and call it over, over.. . For some reason I had a heck of a time getting the in room remote control to work; and work properly. I know this, because I have been to the Aria several times and have never had the headache that I experience this last time. The room is still quite comfortable and nice and quite. The A/C was never able to break 70 degrees (even though the thermostat went down further). I had room service on several occasions. Each time, the person bringing the food refused to follow directions. Each time they asked if I would like my food unwrapped. Each time, they proceeded to unwrap my food. This bothered me, mainly because I was asked a question and then my answer was ignored.. . For now, I will be trying another casino, but anyone looking to stay here should. It is clean, smells good and fairly decent food options to be had. Just don't go to Javier (see other review).
I will never stay in a different strip resort, if I can avoid it. I love this hotel. . . This was my first stay at the Aria and I can't say enough good things about it. My experience began when we mentioned off hand upon check in that we were on out honeymoon and the next thing we knew, they had upgraded our room to a junior suite (free). Shortly after arriving in the actual room, someone stopped by to drop off complimentary cakes and chocolate covered strawberries with a congratulatory note. They really went out of their way to make our stay special. . . The rooms are also extremely nice. Curtains that open and close by remote, excellent views, and very modern decor. I've seen some people complain about the AC, curtains, and water flow from the faucets. What these people don't seem grasp is that the Aria is one of the most (if not THE most) environmentally conscious resorts on the strip. They have numerous environmental certifications (look it up). These are a result of such room features as curtains that close automatically when you're not there, lights that turn off automatically of you leave them on, low water flow, and AC that adjusts when you are not in the room. I, for one, feel great about staying in a place that feels luxurious but makes every effort to be energy and water efficient. . . The pool is also excellent. It's low key (doesn't have that "spring break" vibe), plays some great music throughout the day, isn't terribly crowded, and offers plenty of shade for those looking to stay out of the sun. It was one of the reasons we chose to stay here. . . I love this hotel. Is is more expensive than some of the other southern strip resorts, but well worth the extra cost. Give it a try.
Great stay.  3rd time.  The beds make you feel like you are sleeping on clouds.  . . Pool should have an adults only section, other than their ultra pool.  It would be nice to relax without all the splashing and "Marco Polo.". . Also, the room ipad type thing is so laggy it becomes frustrating.. . Remember to hit the service button to the on position or they will not service your room.
