First time in Vegas, but didn't want to eat at typical local tourist-y spots. When I search for food in new locations, I usually search for Mom and Pop shops. This is THE Mom and Pop shop to dine at. The quality was amazing. The succulent beef ribs were cooked to perfection. My only regret was not ordering the buffet option and only being able to visit once. If I ever step foot in Vegas again, this is the spot I'll return to; and not just a single visit either. My suggestion is to with a group, order the buffet, and try everything on the damn menu!
This place is outstanding!! I consider myself choosy when buying ribs away from home because I have come to prefer what I usually cook. Man, this place has a great menu and well-prepared ribs. They ribs were just what you want from wood-cooking. Tasty and tender. I will be visiting this place every time I go to Vegas!
Great BBQ spot near the strip, but not on the strip. its a small place so make sure you spot the grill outside the parking lot. Staff is very friendly, food came out quick and it was delicious!!! A must try!
This place just blows me away ! Look do yourself a favor , go here get the all you can eat for 24.99 and eat some or all you want of everything they have. It's all good.And I guarantee if you have any appetite at all you will come out ahead of a regular dinner order at Lucilles and have infinitely more food.
I am a simple man, and when i am in search of good bbq, i only ask for one thing...flavor.. . From the chicken, to the ribs, to the brisket, to a majority of the sides...this place has got it. Just moved out to vegas and this place will be my go-to from now on.
BBQ was so flavorful and tasty. The family loved it. Plenty of food for the price. Awesome service.
This place is GOOD! AT least the rib tips corn fritters and beans anyway. Brought a friend who thought it was great too! So sad I haven't been here sooner, but so happy now :) I'll definitely be coming here for BBQ from now on!!
I love this place! The main reason is because as they've grown you can see it in the improvements of their restaurant. It won't be much longer before they are hiring Front of the House staff to man the tables! . . The food is good, The staff is nice. I like that they are getting their name out there and a local business being successful. . . On this trip I had the chicken, which is always good in flavor and spare rib, in the duo smokin plate. The spare rib was tender and tasty. I got the jalapeno coleslaw...it's so good! The BF got the Brisket Dog, omg! If I wasn't eating right, I'd devour that whole thing without a second thought! It was so good, anything with nacho cheese is good! The BF got the potato salad, which was basic but the bacon of course added a yummy touch! . . We love this place! We wish it much success and don't forget your free dessert with your Yelp check in.
Came here with 4 of my hungry friends and ordered the BBQ Sampler. It was delicious and satisfied our bbq craving after 4th of July. Even though we eat a lot it was enough to make us full. Best BBQ in Vegas imo
Unbelievable! I won't be going to Lucilles BBQ anymore.. This place is not only BOMB but the prices are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great food! The catfish and shrimp was tasty but my only complaint is the mashed potatoes tasted sour
it was good,
You can't get better BBQ than this in LV. It's BBQ heaven. They offer an All You Can Eat! We had the brisket, chicken, spare ribs and the Best Beef Rib this side of the Atlantic Ocean. So tender and juicy! All the food has serious BBQ flavor.  The beans (omg) are what BBQ beans should always be. Don't forget to ask for the Damn Hot BBQ sauce, just to kick up the flavor to spicy. Great staff that will make your visit more enjoyable.
Loved the food! . . I remembered a BBQ place from DDD in Las Vegas and figured I'd try it on my next trip to Vegas. The place is not far from the strip but does look a bit sketchy from the outside. The inside of the restaurant is very clean and the sports tv's are a bonus.. . I tried the pulled pork sliders and the rib platter, everything was tasty. The BBQ sauce is delicious, our ribs were cooked perfectly. . . And the corn bread is too die for!!!!
Was surprised at the high rating. I will say the chicken was excellent. The pork, brisket, and hot links were all average at best. The sides were average too. The man taking orders was nice, but the guys delivering the food were so rude. I can't believe I tipped (you tip when you pay for the food at the beginning).
Found this place to be very expensive for the amount food that we got. We order a rack of beef ribs it was &24.99 and it was 4 half ribs.  We also ordered the meal that said 2 to 4 people for $35.00 and was 2 small sides and 4 small biscuits and all the meat was in one styrofoam tray and didn't even come close to feeding 4 people. So $64.00 dollars was a good meal for 2.
Look, I'm Texan.  I've grown up around barbecue.  And I've found that the West Coast didn't have much in the way of barbecue when I was living in SoCal (correct me if I'm wrong, I take suggestions).  And while I like Lucille's here, that's more Cajun than the stuff I grew up with.. . On a whim, we found this place.  It's in the middle of nowhere, in an area you probably wouldn't venture to, in a tiny shopping center that you wouldn't notice.  But you'll notice that smell when you step out of the car.  And I mean BAM!. . Once that scent hit my nose, I had to know more.  Also, not Texas based, I will graciously concede that Arkansas knows their stuff, and this place knows their stuff.. . The staff is nice, and one look at them told me these people weren't anything but legit.  I liked the cook immediately.  We ordered a rib combo plate, and let the dining begin.. . It was so good.  Nice and spicy, meat falling off the bone, a big squirt bottle of sauce on the table, I ate and ate and ate, and then I got kind of woozy, and asked for a "to go".  I moaned all the way home.  Partly because I was full, yes, but partly because this place hit the sweet spot of barbecue goodness.  I went for my leftovers, and shredded bones like a barbarian.. . I regret nothing.. . Will I go back?  Absolutely.  Small, subtle, out of the way, but so worth it when it came to dining options, friendly people, fast service, and quality of food.. . They have something called a "BBQ Sundae".  That sounds intriguing, and I wish to know more.
I don't know how I've never had this BBQ or even heard of it, really.  But some BBQ showed up for a catered work lunch and boy was it good.  Now I'm going to have to make a trip to the restaurant to see what it's all about.  I think the best BBQ I had in Vegas  before Rollin Smoke was Famous Dave's, and Famous Dave's sucks.  Glad to know there's good BBQ in Vegas!
This is the best BBQ I have had since Pappys Smoke house in St. Louis. If you come  to Vegas and you don't check this place out you got cheated.
An awesome experience if your looking for great BBQ! It's more cafeteria style in that you order, then sit down and then the food is brought to you. I ordered the brisket sandwich. The brisket is very soft- almost as soft as the bread itself. The sandwich consisted of the brisket, BBQ sauce, and some chopped green onion. I appreciate the simplicity, but everything was the same texture and it could have used a crunch. I liked it though, and I would order it again. My boyfriend got the rib sampler which consisted of spare ribs, baby backs, and one beef rib. Baby back are excellent, spare ribs are everything you would expect, beef rib is very good as well but he doesn't normally like beef ribs. The sauce itself is good and I liked that they only gave one option, because that's the only one you need. We also had the sides Mac n cheese and jalapeno coleslaw. In my opinion, these two sides can be skipped. Mac n cheese tasted a little too artificially cheesy, and the coleslaw had an overwhelming jalapeno flavor. Cornbread was everything you want, sweet, soft, warm, delicious. What really made my experience though, was the amazing staff! They are so helpful and so nice throughout the entire experience. Go here. You'll love it.
The owner was great, such pride in what he does. Food was awesome. Especially recommend the fried onion strings. If you like a little heat, the jalapeno cole slaw rocks.
This place boils the meat & the sauce is boring.. Mom was not impressed... but then she is from KCMO and we are accustomed to the barbeque of KCMO, TN & TX.  . . My fried-shrimp was great, but I would have preferred a cocktail sauce and not the their barbeque sauce to dip them in.
Worst bbq I have ever had. The meat was tough, fatty, and their rub was bland as hell! The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 was because the mac n cheese I got was fairly decent
Good bbq ribs, chicken, Pulled Pork, and Hush puppies. Thebrisket was very dry and not anything like the pictures on yelp on Saturday at 8pm. The peach cobbler. was my least favorite, but the banana fosters and their bbq sauce were the best part of our $60 takeout meal.
I'm more of a baby back rib guy. The lean, tender, fall of the bone meat was the Holy grail. I found beef ribs to be chewy and stringy, until I found this place. They may have pulled a game changer. Their beef ribs were incredible. Better then any pork I have had so far. Frankly I'm going to have to go back and try again just to see if it was a fluke. It may be the best litmus test I have ever had to do.
I met up with a few Yelpers on the day that Travel Channel's Food Paradise was filming here. We were too late for our 15 seconds of fame, but the film crew was still there and it was neat watching them work. It was also not as crowded as I had expected, so it was quick to order and many tables available. The food took a bit longer to come out, but I believe that's standard.. . I ordered the "Duo Choice of Two Meats" Smokin Plate with Hot Link and 2 Spare Ribs (other meat choices are brisket, pork, or 1/4 chicken), Waffle Fries (there are 16 choices of Smokin Sides), and a drink for $10.99. The sausage or hot link was really tasty and they're not messing around with the heat! If you can't handle spicy food, watch out. I enjoyed the ribs as well, especially with their BBQ sauce. I definitely could've eaten more! I liked their offerings of sweetened and unsweetened iced tea as I mixed the two and had a nice balance.. . We tried a couple cobblers, banana pudding, and the special Reese's PB bread pudding. The cobblers were all right and the banana pudding was decent. The bread pudding was off the hook though! Really good!. . I think one of the best parts of their menu is the AYCE option for $24.99. It's offered all day, every day and has no restrictions (except no sharing or to-go, obviously). It's a ridiculous deal for meat! If I can get a few people together, I think that it would be a cool option to order all the types of meat and sides for everyone.
We stopped by here for dinner a few nights ago while traveling through. Things are a little pricier than I would imagine for the amount of food you get. I did the two meat meal for $10.99. I got two short ribs and two strips of brisket on top of a soggy piece of white bread and a side of macaroni and cheese. I thought the short ribs were very good and would recommend those. The brisket was good and the macaroni and cheese was forgettable. My wife got the $7.99 brisket sandwich and thought it was pretty good.. . Because we checked in via Yelp, we got a "free dessert." We ordered the Blue Bell Ice Cream Sundae. What they brought us was a shot glass sized plastic cup filled 2/3 with ice cream and 1/3 with whipped cream. If that dessert really costs 3.99, it is a complete rip off. It's more likely that they only gave us a sample size dessert as the "free dessert" that was advertised. Don't they know better than to cut corners with people who use Yelp? Whatever the case, I was less than impressed by that. . . Overall, I might stop back by here to give it another shot if I was in town for a bit and looking for a meal under $15 a plate (although they have many options that would put you over that limit, including an all you can eat thing for $25). But with so many other places to eat in Vegas, it's more likely I'll try somewhere else.
Good BBQ in Vegas has been very hard to find, especially when you're from Kansas City which is one of America's BBQ capitals. Rollin Smoke is the ONLY place in Vegas for the past 2 years now that consistently satisfies my cravings for good BBQ. If I get a bad case of homesickness, Rollin Smoke's brisket is the cure. . . Location: Off the beaten path. Yeah, its hard to get to but that's why you have the Yelp app on your smartphone. . . Parking: If it's busy it can be tight. But I've always found a place to park. . . Seating: If you're with someone who's claustrophobic or hates eating in close quarters around others get your food to go. It's kinda tight inside. . . Price: Compared with BBQ places I've been to in the Carolinas, Memphis, Texas, and Kansas City I think the pricing is quite reasonable for the amount of food you get. You can overpay for crappy BBQ at a lot of places in Vegas, or you can pay a fair price and get quality at Rollin Smoke. It's your choice. . . Service: It's not perfect but the staff knows how to hustle and get you in and out for lunch, or if you're trying to eat before catching a show or heading to somewhere on the Strip. And even with the speedy service you still get great BBQ!. . From brisket to ribs and their beans, I have yet to find anything here that sucks. It's just good. Really good. Overall you really can't go wrong coming here. . . I try and limit posting 5 Star reviews these days but Rollin Smoke has earned nothing less.
This is what I think of when I look for BBQ.  I have been trying all the places in Vegas I can find.   The owners are from Arkansas.  So, if you like Arkansas BBQ, Louisiana, or Texas BBQ you will be in heaven.. . They have beef ribs that are juicy and delicious.  Smoked 19 hours.  They have a rub on them and then you add BBQ sauce. The Pork ribs, chicken are very good too.  Haven't been able to find any food to complain about.  I get a little quiet when I am there enjoying the food so much.. . People have complained about cost to portion, but the portions are big enough for my husband to be stuffed and full most of the day.  Cost wise, it seemed reasonable for good quality BBQ to me and I will be back frequently.. . I tried the catfish and it has a crunchy cornmeal coating with and no weird after flavor you sometimes get with catfish.   I have had it twice now since it is so good.  Once in a basket and once as a poor boy sandwich.   Love it.  I can't decide which is my favorite the beef ribs or the catfish.. . The sides I have tried are:  mac and cheese -flavor is good, but I prefer a baked thick cheese sauce over this one.. Hush puppies: pretty tasty. Corn fritters:  tasty, the corn is inside a breading.   Being from Virginia I have some expectations that probably aren't normal or liked by many others.  I felt these were good, but a little blander than I like.   I enjoy the corn tucked into a spicy hush puppy myself. . Haven't had space for any desserts yet, but I will have to get some to go next time.  I am usually going somewhere else after.. . They also will cook up a whole pig for parties.  Price varies depending on market price so call them.  Very cool.. . Can't wait to eat there again.   Also if you go early enough in the day they have a cool electrical store called Kiesub next door.   If you are tech oriented you will enjoy it.
went there for dinner last night. AMAZING food! I would recommened this to anyone who likes BBQ! must try!
Hands down the best BBQ I have ever had!! I did the all you can eat so I could try a little bit of everything. They don't give you a "little" of anything!! The beef rib was the star of the show!! In my experiences with BBQ, the beef rib is kinda the red headed stepchild, not here! I highly recommend this place! Off the beaten path, just the way I like it!!
About as good as you can get in Las Vegas.  Portions are great, Prices are good and it tastes good too!
Absolutely amazing! The pulled pork is mouth watering goodness. The brisket is de-lish and the HOT links are extremely hot and yummy. We will definitely be back!!! ****THE BEST BBQ IN VEGAS****
Was there fri July 18 and wow was the food amazing , had three meat platter and was blown away by the pulled pork , ribs. But the show stopper was the brisket. The flavour was like nothing I have ever had before. When in back I vegas will defiantly be back.
Ok. Second & third trip here has verified Rolling Smoke as the best BBQ "Joint" in Vegas for my money. Links are far and away my favorite. Their ribs, brisket, & potato salad are very close seconds. The service is friendly and the price is very fair. The sometime long wait is to be expected when you have food and the associated reputation that goes with it this good. A must for bbq lovers and non cooks
Everything was great besides the greens (too bitter and unflavorfull). Highly recommend the corn nuggets and banana pudding.
Tried Rollin Smoke tonight on friend's recommendation.  It was okay.  The sauce was good (on the thin side as you'd expect for this style) with just a hint of sweet. . . I had the duo plate with brisket, hot link and jalapeno coleslaw.  The brisket was good, flavor and smoke wise.  The hot link was the worst I've ever had, it had so much connective tissue that I couldn't chew it and ended up looking like the clown with the never ending scarf being pulled out of my mouth (eeewwww, and not attractive, right???),  The coleslaw was fairly flavorless; as I would eat it the heat would gradually build but nothing other than that.. . Husband had the pit special; brisket, pulled pork, spare ribs, hot link, hush puppies, mac & cheese, and collard greens.  He agreed with my assessment on the brisket and the hot link.  He liked the hush puppies but felt the mac & cheese and the collard greens were WAY over cooked and lacking flavor.. . Sister had the pulled piggy with hush puppies.  She said the pork was moist, tender, and had a good flavor.  She liked the hush puppies but they were a touch spicy for her.. . It was worth a try but I can't say that we'll be back.
Come for the BBQ meats. baby back RIBs MELTED right off the bone! super tender and delicious with a nice smokey touch. Brisket was delicious! and tender and just great. Pulled pork, needs the bbq sauce. it was good, but i would not get this again. mac and cheese and fried okra were standard, not amazing but it went well with the bbq. . . the service was great: the guy told us about each dish and checked up on us to make sure we were enjoying the food. its not a sit down restaurant, but he took the time to do so anyways. . restaurant:. this is a shabby place in a shabby neighborhood. nothing special about it at all. . . Coming back to this place for sure! the food was delicious!
There's really so much delicious food thats affordable off the strip!. . Luckily a friend of ours rented a car for our vegas weekend so we all came here for some delicious BBQ!. . The place was pretty packed when we got there but they were quick to take orders and expedite the line. You order first then find your seat so be ready! . . Everyone in my group was so hungry that we didn't even entertain the thought of sharing (which we really should have) and we all ordered separately.. . I opted for the chicken wings with the sweet corn pups and a side of catfish. One of my friends got the meatloaf and others got the ribs and brisket sampler deals.. . OMG SOOO MUCH FOOD!!! I loved the sweet corn pup things an the catfish was sooo good. Battered just right with alot of catfish meat. My wings were pretty tasty. I went for the mild sauce as its blazing hot in vegas already and I didn't want to suffer by eating hot and spicy buffalo wings. I really wanted to though ;(. . Oh they also have sweet tea! Yes... I love bbq and this place does it right. Next time my friends and I will definitely go for the family meals and will split it lol!
We came as a group and ordered brisket, chicken, sliders, meatloaf and ribs. We all shared and everything was really reallllly good! The meat was juicy and the sauce was perfect. Sides were delish and we got a free banana pudding for checking into yelp that was pretty damn good too. It's small and really no-frills but the people were friendly and it smells amazing. We didn't see that there was an extra seating area not attached to the main restaurant until we left but I would recommend sitting there so it's not as crowded. We'll definitely be back!
My son is a local and read many articles on this las vegas "find". word is out that rollin' smoke  has authentic,serious,very tasty BBQ. You will definitely need your GPS to find this place but it is well worth the search. I sense most folks get their orders to go here although they have a decent sized dining area. pretty spartan no frills establishment. my wife enjoyed her catfish po boy...with hush puppies and cole slaw. my son and I each had the meat sampler.....spare ribs,brisket and chicken got our highest grades. Help aren't really friendly but they get your food out without much of a wait. prices are extremely reasonable and as I said..,.the food is very good. close your eyes and you'll swear you are in KC or Memphis.
the service & Amazing delicious food is finger licking good!  Thank you for a  wonderful experience. this is what real BBQ food is about. Totally a 5 star review :-)
Real deal BBQ. No plates, no fancy napkins, no tablecloths, just really good BBQ. People have covered the menu pretty thoroughly, so I'll just toss in our support for the pulled pork, the baby back ribs, the chicken and the sides. Superb all around. The meats were not over-smoked, and the sauces worked well to complement the meat rather than disguise it.. . The standouts sidewise were the corn nuggets, and the Kickin' beans. The beans had a healthy amount of meat in them and were nicely seasoned. The corn nuggets...don't order the corn nuggets, for all that is holy. They are like crack - instantly addictive. By themselves, dipped in the house sauce, shoved in your ear...you just can't stop eating the little devils.. . Sweet tea made by somebody from the South, that's for sure. Not overly sugared...just right. . . The place is a dive, and that's what sold me on it before I ever set foot in the door. We were the first ones to get there that day for lunch, so Eddie behind the register had time to chat. Nice guy, and a great salesman for the place. By the time we were done eating, at least 6 parties of locals had queued up, paid for their lunches and commenced to chowing down. Get there early is all I can say.. . All in all, a near-perfect BBQ experience. They lose the perfect game by being just too damn far from my house!! I have to wait until I go to Vegas to get my fix! Next week, in fact. Drooooooool. This time I'm going beef.. . Note for out-of-towners - the place is really easy to find. Head north on Las Vegas Blvd. and turn left immediately after Fashion Show Mall (Fashion Show Dr). When the road ends (S. Highland Dr.), turn right. You can see the place from the intersection on the left, just past the freeway overpass.
Being the owner of two Big Green Eggs, I usually make these meats at home, but seeing it is summer here (enough said), it is really nice to be able to go out for this instead of doing it myself all day. . . Hubby had the outlaw burger and I shared my meat plate with him. We also had sides of mac and cheese, yams and corn nuggets.  First off, hubby loved his burger.  I had one bite and it was good, but too much like meatloaf for me both in taste and texture.  I like that they smoked the burger. We do that at home as well and there is nothing better.  Next visit hubby is getting the meatloaf he said. Something about loaded mashed potatoes.......yum.. . I really enjoyed the brisket, it was moist and had just the right amount of smoke infused into it.  Some of it was cut too thick for my liking and as such, didn't have that tug and pull apart you expect, but thankfully, it wasn't served drenched in sauce, that is a no-no in my book.  . . The pulled pork was good, but not great. It lacked that smoky flavor but it was very moist.  I have the same problem making this at home. It is difficult to get that smoke all the way into the deepest part of the meat.  Their BBQ sauce was very nice, not too sweet or just tasting like spiced-up ketchup. The two together were nice and next time on a sandwich it is.. . The chicken was also good, but my favorite for flavor was the homemade sausage. It was nice and smokey and had a great kick at the end.  I would like the grind a bit finer though.  The sides were all tasty.  You could taste the cheese in the mac and cheese and it was not greasy at all. The yams were nice and chunky and sweet but not too sweet. The corn nuggets were perfect, nice and crunchy on the outside, tender and sweet on the inside. H&J on Eastern, take some lessons from this place on how to cook these. . . We shared a banana pudding for dessert and it was creamy good, but I would have liked to see some banana slices in it. The vanilla wafers were nice and soaked with pudding goodness.  I am not sure how we had room to eat it all, but we did.  We took plenty of meat home for leftovers.  . . Will we be back? Yes, of course.  This is by far the best BBQ we have had in Las Vegas so far.  Just wish they were closer to home.
I am very picky when it comes to bbq outside of my family.  Not only was the BBQ on point (delicious), we had outstanding customer service.. . The location is off the beaten path, but there was ample parking and easy to find using our navigation system.  I would consider this spot to be a step up from a whole in the wall kind of place, but it was clean and very good.  Don't take my word, try for yourself and I know you will be pleased.
Best BBQ I've had since leaving the south. Was stationed in Louisiana a few years ago and since leaving have been looking for a place that does BBQ like I had there. This place delivers and then some. The pork was amazing. My picky 7 yr old loved her chicken.. . Being a big guy I'm used to being able to"put a hurting" on some BBQ, but even I tapped out. Great portions and very friendly staff. Definitely going back before we leve Vegas.
We came here for the first time today. They were packed!  We ordered the meatloaf, two meat plate ( brisket and chicken) , and a piggy fry. They accidentally brought us an extra plate of brisket instead of the fries. As soon as we said something the fries were next on the line. The kitchen manager came right out apologized , gave us the brisket and brought out the fries within seconds, he was very friendly.   I thought that was great service. Being born and raised in Las Vegas I have a much higher expectation of service than most others. Anyway the kitchen manager came back out one more time. Offered us free desert , he said " even if you say no I'm bringing it out."  So we asked for the berry cobbler. He returned with his home made banana pudding along with an order of cobbler. The banana pudding was absolutely amazing ! The cobbler was a wine based and was excellent ! Overall the service and the food was wonderful. My father is still raving about his meatloaf and my mother says her chicken was great. I would recommend this place to anyone !
This place is a small hole in the wall and from the outside it doesn't look like much. However the line out the door and the BBQ surrounding the business was a good sign!! The price is $25 for all you can eat dinning in which is extremely affordable. I seen the plates going by while in line and knew one plate was going to be plenty. I ordered the 3 meat combo chicken links and brisket w a side of Mac n cheese!! The sauce was a condiment and the meat w so juicy and seasoned just right!! My God the chicken was AMAZING I was so impressed I got the breast and it literally melted in my mouth!!  I can't say it enough this place was sooooooooo good!!! This is added to my list of must haves when I go to Vegas!!!
Hot damn!! Really good BBQ!! Get in there!! Brisket was too good!! Love that Mac n cheese too!! Off the strip, but sooo fricken good!!! Well worth the trip!!!. Going back for more the 2nd night
Melt in your mouth BBQ.  It lived up to everything it was supposed to be.  I had the slider trio, and the pulled pork was AH MAZE ING.  I wish it had more pickles, but that's because I'm a pickle person.. . It's a small place so make sure you grab a table while you can!  Food is quick, came out in about 10mins.  Plenty of big tables for larger groups.
