Absolutely outstanding! When I took my first sip of crisp Sancere to wash down the flakiest French bread, I seriously flashed back to the REAL Paris for a moment. The menu is the ideal sampling of Parisian faves, service is classy (our waiter was even French!!) and everything we ordered was just perfection - scallops, butter-drenched crab cake, fracis with goat cheese & quinoa, I didn't want to leave!!!
My boyfriend treated me to a late lunch for my birthday. He wanted something different for me and I was fine with that. I'm rating based on my overall experience here. I'm really not picky about where I sit when I eat but I felt uncomfortable where we were placed. The table seemed right in the middle of an area where all the traffic flowed in. The waitress brought us our drinks (soda) and they turned out to be diet. She gladly exchanged them. For the prices listed in the menu I was expecting a bit more on my plate. I had the caramelized scallops, which came 4 pieces (25 dollars) total along with sliced red bell peppers. It looked as if it was missing something, the plate looked a bit bare to me. So I ordered a side of asparagus. The asparagus didn't come until the end of my meal only after I asked about them. My boyfriend got an amazing steak (27 dollars) made my meal look like a toddler's meal:) My meal, although small in size, was very delicious. I don't see myself ordering that dish in the future. I was expecting more overall and I felt disappointed...but it was my birthday so no complaints allowed at the table. :)
Food was great but the service was very bad. We requested to be moved to a better seat since there were a lot of seats available. We were told that they were in a wait which after 45 mins the seats remained vacant. Manager was very arrogant and rude.
my favorite breakfast spot on the strip! A perfect view with a perfect breakfast. NOMZ
Every time I go to Vegas I have to eat breakfast here, it is my favorite breakfast spot. The food is great and the location can't be beat. Siting outside across from the Bellagio fountains while enjoying a nice breakfast is unbeatable.   The service is fast and prompt and the prices are not bad for Vegas. Is it as cheap as your local breakfast place, no, but it is affordable.
Love this place!  It has a great atmosphere, the food is consistently good, if you sit on the patio you can watch the Fountain show of the Bellagio.
The service was great. The bread was really good, loved the pickled carrots, the combination was probably my favorite part of the meal. I ordered the Classique steak which was good. The fries are amazing!
What a wonderful place for lunch!! I absolutely adore this place. I have only been once, but I plan on going on  a regular basis because the French Onion soup is amazing! I found my tuna salad way too salty, otherwise I would give it 5-stars. . . The location alone is perfect for a girls-lunch or a fun date. I suggest sitting on the covered patio part where you are out of the direct sunlight but you can still people watch. I did have to wait awhile for my food, so I suggest not going if you are in a rush.
OK enough food....on the rather expensive side for the quality and quantity of fare.  It's more of a "food factory" than it is a satisfying overall dining or culinary experience.  Best way to describe this place:  Average Vegas middle of the road strip hotel restaurant food.  As for being French?  Well, it's really in name only and would maybe fool the person who's never left Las Vegas their whole life.  It would be perfect if there were Groupons for this place....25 for 50 or 20 for 40 would help make it worthwhile.
This place is super over hyped. I thought it was going to be super French... But the bread was as French as this place got. . . Came here for brunch and my cousin and I shared the Salmon Eggs Benedict and the Nutella Waffles. Salmon eggs Benedict was good, nothing special. Nutella waffles I wish was oozing out Nutella. It was just minimal. . . I think I was more in love with their jam! Idk what it was...boysenberry? So good though! The bread was addicting. Service here was nothing special. I felt like we were waiting forever bc we had to remind our server to even bring bread out for us!
My GF had Mon Ami Gabi bookmarked; so, during this stop over in LV, we decided to give it a try.  We were looking forward to trying the Beef Wellington, but upon sitting down we soon found out that it is their Sunday special, and since it was Thursday we were SOL on that front.  Ok, no problem.  Surely there is a lot of other good stuff here to eat.  We started looking over the rather brief menu.  We decided to go with a Shrimp Cocktail, the Summer Tomato Salad, and the fish special of the day - Sea Bass.  The Shrimp Cocktail was nothing special and very over-priced: $15 for 5 shrimp on a bed of ice with a very small cocktail sauce container.  The summer tomato salad was even more disappointing: a few slices of tomatoes spread over a plate with a basil leave or two, a few very small pieces of grilled zucchini, and an almost non-existent marinade.  I can make a more impressive looking and tasting tomato salad.  I understand this is a French restaurant, and smaller portions are the nom in Europe.  I have no problem with that provided the quality of the dish makes up for it.  Mon Ami Gabi's did not.  But the real icing on this cake, and the reason for two stars instead of three, was the incredibly lousy service we received from our server, Gabriel.  From the moment we sat down, it was a lot of attitude, and a lot of waiting.  We were planning on trying a desert, but we got tired of waiting for our waiter after we finished eating, and decided to not give Mon Ami Gabi any more of our business.
Great breakfast and a perfect view of the Strip.  Get there early or make reservations to get a nice spot outside.
Yay me for being review #4000 (I think)!. . Anyways, my sister, brother-in-law, and I stopped by Mon Ami for a late dinner around 10. Worst part about Vegas is that if it's open, it's busy. The hostess originally told us that they were not accepting walk-ins until 11 but my sister was clever enough to make a reservation through Yelp for 10:30.. . After losing money at the slot machines, we were seated promptly. Our server was a bit awkward but extremely helpful and courteous. We ordered 2 hanger steaks, 1 mac & cheese, and a kale salad. The hanger steaks were exquisite. They were super tender and the fries were super thin and crispy albeit over salted. The kale salad was okay. Nothing special. The macaroni and cheese was pretty good too though but I believe technically it would be shells and cheese. . . We also shared a carafe of "frangria" and it was good but I would've preferred regular sangria. It was almost too light and juicy. It was almost like watered down wine. . . Overall the dinner was good but pricy. I would come back since everything in Vegas is expensive but at the same time it seems more popular than it deserves.
Bon appetitie! Mostly a steakhouse with a french flair. Menu is anglo friendly enough and yes, they have escargot to make it authentic. Entrees are varied with non beef dishes nicely done as well. Service is complete and polite, dining room is only slightly buzzy with chatter at your own table very easy and without intrusive noise from afar. Decor is rich and ambiance is strong. Prices are par for Vegas, good value compared to nonVegas venues, but no ten dollar steaks either. My salad was fresh, portions were good, food well prepared. One small gripe, the excellent baguettes are delivered with only a spreading knife to cut cut them. It's both comical and aggrevating to see the thrashing and hammering efforts that go on at each table to piece out the loaf with a totally ineffective knife. Pinching off pieces was the best fallback. Nice outdoor seating complements to comfortable dining room. Very worth of a future visit.
Went with a large group. The food was cold and the bernaise sauce was icy. The other waiter never came back so we couldn't switch out. Ended up just eating it.
Love the outdoor seating! This is by far my favorite brunch spot on the strip!
I love this place! I have eaten here a few times now and every time it has been delicious. If you are lucky enough to grab a seat outside it also in a great spot on the strip to people watch. It is pretty reasonably priced and the service is impeccable. I definitely recommend Mon Ami Gabi.
We were two adults with our three kids who came across this oasis of a restaurant in an otherwise scuzzy area of Las Vegas sidewalk replete with mentally ill citizens and last night's party trash.  We ended up so blown away by the quality of food and service that we came back the next morning again!   Sampling only the breakfast options, Gabi aimed to please:  we have a dairy and gluten-allergic daughter, so we asked our friendly server, David, if the kitchen might accommodate a non-allergic waffle.  Not only did he/it do so but our daughter loved it!   Besides that, the other waffles, fruit salad, crepes, frisee with poached egg, incredibly flaky pain au chocolat and endlessly refilled coffee in the French-bistro-like environ, made for two very memorable meals and rendered Mon Ami Gabi nos ami pour toujours!  If only we could return for dinner!  Next time...
My boyfriend and I decided to try french cuisine on our date night, since he hasn't really had french food. We ordered the escargot, which he loved. For me, I wasn't highly impressed, since I have tried escargot elsewhere. I felt as if it lacked the garlic butter flavor and tasted more oily than ever. . . Our entrees were the hanger steak with Merlot butter and the Dijon steak. Both had impeccable flavors. The Dijon steak had more burst of flavor than the hanger steak, but both were incredible. The frites were so delicious. As for the drinks, I ordered a frangria which was good. I ordered a small, so beware that if you are the only one drinking, it's plentiful. :) . . Last, but not least, we ordered dessert. The "la grande profiterole." Let me try to explain this the best I can.... If an eclair and a cream puff mated and had babies, this is what would come out. Haha. It had vanilla ice cream in the middle too! It was so good, it makes me wanna slap yo momma! I would definitely come back and would love to try their lunch. The added bonus is their view of the bellagio fountains, if you are lucky to get a seating by the window or patio. :)
I've been eyeing this place for years since it's located right on the strip at the Paris hotel and I've always told myself I'll try this place out. Well fast forward 5+ years and on July 4th I finally found the time to eat here! Why did I wait this long? You always see a packed patio when walking/driving down. Entrance is located in the Paris Casino (not the main entrance) but off to the side. Arrived at lunch time with hubby and was greeted by friendly hostess who sat us inside the dining area. We had the lunch menu in hand so I decided to order the lobster roll. Hubby ordered the special that was off the menu. It was some type of sandwich with goat cheese. Both dishes were extremely yummy and I was surprised to see how much lobster they put in my sandwich. Service was great, our waters were refilled without having to say anything and our waiter was friendly and quick. . . My only issue was how close all the tables were. Hubby had to move from his seat right across from me because he kept getting bumped by people squeezing through. . . Can't wait for my next trip to Vegas. I will be back to try other items from the menu.
We had a great dinner here. This was by far our favorite meal of the trip and very reasonably priced for being on the strip! Be sure to request a table in their front area with the windows that overlooks the Bellagio fountain. Such a cute atmosphere, great service, and the food was great! The French Onion soup was great as well as the steak frites with a red wine reduction. This is definitely a place I would return to on another trip!
Beautiful place. Steak is great! Outside sitting and amazing views of the Bellagio fountains. Service is top notch and the vibe is perfect for a romantic outing.
anddddd im back! made a reservation (please ask to be inside cause it gets HOT in the summer, trust me people). but we had a view of the fountains and its beautiful . the service is always good to above par never had any complaints. . now the food. got an order of the jumbo crabcake. AMAZING it was perfectly seared, good chunks of crab tasted amazing with the lemony sauce mmmmm wow i think it was my favorite crab cake ever! it was delicious!!! . . 10/10. . steak frites. this was okay, not my favorite steak but im not really a steak guy anways, wasnt as hot as id like. i like the butter that was mixed with some other stuff, all green haha. the fries were delicious but not my favorite. . 6.5/10. . lobster roll. i thought this was going to be warm! i had no idea it was gonna be cold, it was good but i was hoping for a nice toasty warm lobster roll. the bread though was amazing! nice and buttery mmmm dang it was good. the chips thay were included were ookay , some are all soggy but cant complain too much. . 6/10. . nice champagne! 10 bucks oor so each!. . 9/10. . service, solid, ntohing to complain about . . 8.5/10. . view! its perfect! just go there sit back and wtch the bellagio fountains its amazing. . 10/10
Every time we come to Vegas, we go there for lunch. This time we had salmon tartare, which was great. Baked goat cheese was simply amazing, and is one of their famous appetizers. I had crape with cheese which was good, and hubby had lobster roll, which was pretty good as well. The only thing I didn't like was their Bloody Mary, but as long as the food is good, I can live with that :) Service could have been slightly better, I think they forgot about us for a brief moment. So 4 stars this time.
I had my last meal in Vegas here. Very satisfying breakfast.. . The restaurant is pretty big, with a large patio that has a beautiful view of the Strip.. . Ate the corned beef hash. Big chunks of corned beef tossed with potatoes and roasted red pepper and topped with two beautifully poached eggs. The flavors were awesome. Nice and salty corned beef cut with rich egg yolk. Bread was nice and hearty to soak up all those flavors. . . The menu is pretty diverse, but I think I found my go-to dish here.. . I'll be going back to Vegas for a long layover, and Mon Ami Gabi is definitely on my list for breakfast before heading out of town.
Had some excellent Duck a l'Orange. GREAT service, and balcony strip dining. A bit pricey, but worth a visit if you can afford it.
Came here twice this past Vegas trip because of the convenience and the food.  Food was very tasty and the service was excellent.  We had the French onion soup which my wife thought was the best she tasted.  The burger for lunch was cooked perfectly.  My wife ordered the ribeye for dinner and it was above average.  Need to go to a steakhouse to have GREAT steak.  Overall, an above average experience.  We'll be back.
Cute place with a great view of the Bellagio. Yummy Breakfast and lunch. They have a bloody mary bar!! I have just tried a couple of appetizers and wine for dinner. French onion soup is a must Best place to people watch if you get the outside seating. Good luck and good eats!
I actually really enjoyed this place! The two of us went the morning after the 4th of July, so we beat the crowds at 9 AM. We were seated right away and the waitress was super friendly. We ordered the strawberry waffles and three eggs which we got with sausage. Everything was so good. My waffles were crunchy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. The whipped cream was a nice addition to the fresh strawberry slices on my waffles. The sausage wasn't too salty which I'm always afraid of, the eggs were cooked perfectly, and the toast was perfect as well. A very light and easy breakfast done right.
Mon Ami Gabi had been on my wish list for quite some time. The most recent trip to Vegas allowed me to finally go this establishment and I was not disappointed.. . First Mon Ami Gabi is located right on the Vegas strip with both an indoor and outdoor section with a nice view of the fountains at the Bellagio casino across the strip. We decided to eat indoors since it was over 100 degrees that day. . . I ordered a mixture of appetizers that included the French Onion Soup/Onion Soup Au Gratin, the Chicken Liver Mousse Pate, and the Baked Goat Cheese. The goat cheese I'd only seen on a Spanish menu before so I was interested in comparing them. Mon Ami's take was nice and creamy with a tomato sauce surrounding it and a slice of French bread with an herb garlic mix on top to scoop up the food with. The Pate was nice and creamy and served with some toasted bread to it with. The Onion Soup was good but not as thick with cheese as I would have liked but had good flavor nonetheless.. . My son got Prime Steak Sandwich which was served with Mon Ami's thinly sliced fries. He devoured it and especially liked the au jos sauce to dip it in.. . My niece ordered the Cheeseburger that was served with fries as well and loved it.. . The one drawback was my wife got the classique steak. Mon Ami has several steak preparations but uses the same cut for each one. My wife said it wasn't the greatest piece of meat so she was slightly disappointed.. . Despite that we would gladly go back to Mon Ami Gabi and I was happy to finally check this restaurant off my list.
One of the few places that can entice us to enter the wild and wacky world of the Las Vegas Strip.  Mon Ami Gabi is one of our favorite places for a special occasion dinner.  The food is amazing, excellent wine list and very consummate sommeliers to assist with the right choice.  Ambiance is second to none, whether inside or outside watching the fountains at Bellagio while you eat.  My personal faves are the escargot and the Roquefort steak, but oysters are always fresh and wonderful and the bread is slammin!
This has become my all time favorite place to eat in Vegas. .. especially when friends from out of town are visiting because not only is the food delicious and the service great but if you sit on the patio you get the best view in town with the Bellagio fountain show going off across the street and all the people watching you can do on the strip
We were handed menus and after ordering, then the waiter informed my friend that the item she ordered would take over an hour to cook because we went there for lunch but that item was a dinner item. Shouldn't there be separate menus? Or at least indicate on the menu that the item is a dinner item. . . Waitress got her face too close to my face for my personal comfort. . . Food was good but had too much butter and salt -- couldn't even finish my asparagus because it was swimming in butter or oil... Way to make a vegetable unhealthy! Lol . . On the plus side, the salmon was tasty and moist. The gluten free bread was satisfying and crispy. . . All in all, okay food but plenty of room for improvement in both preparation and service.
My husband and I had brunch at Mon Ami Gabi the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend.  We were able to make a 10:00am reservation through yelp the night before.  We were seated in the indoor section with the huge window facing Bellagio which I loved because it was bright and sunny like sitting in the outdoor area but without having to deal with the heat!  The food was delicious...I had the eggs benedict special, mushroom and brie, with a mimosa and my husband had the ham and cheese omelette and we both enjoyed our meal!
What a fantastic restaurant!!! I recently stayed at the Paris Hotel and was delighted to learn they have Gluten Fee options within the hotel. I ate breakfast at this restaurant and I was blown away! I sat inside and it had a nice, classy feel. The waiter was very nice and friendly. I ordered the Gluten Free Eggs Benedict and was pleasantly surprised! The waiter recommended the heirloom tomatoes also and they were fantastic! The GF bread was AMAZING. Best GF bread I have ever tasted. I usually do not like GF bread so this was a delight. The coffee was great too. Mon Ami Gabi also has a wonderful outside patio right on the strip so you can people-watch if you like.
The ambiance a incredible in the front window room that provides great views of the Bellagio fountains. The food and service could have been better if the server hadn't forgot our appetizer and the cut of steak was a bit more manageable. My cousin ordered at bone and got two separate small tbone medallions. Two bones means a lot less meat when you usu get your serving by the weight. All the other entrees were fine and well seasoned but you only get fries or mash as a side. Subbing veggies for the tater have an up charge.
Scallops Gratinees is my favorite one. very fresh
Molly was our server. Extremely friendly, knowledgable and attentive. Food was amazing, particularly the Baked Goat cheese, escargot, Chicken liver pate and Top sirloin steak with brandy peppercorn sauce. A must in Vegas
This is one of my "go to"  restaurant on the strip...customer service....the price is right....ambiance is amazing and food is to die for! And if you're lucky and patient, you can sit on the patio over-looking Bellagio and the fountain show and of course people watching.  And it's remarkable how they accommodate your every requests from our anniversary to reunion. There famous for there steak and frites which all are amazing!  Definitely coming back again and again!
My family and I came here while they were in from NY, and I have to say I was pretty underwhelmed. Here's what I tried and what I can speak to:. . Baked goat cheese. Pate. Steak bearnaise. Steak tartare . . The baked goat cheese lacked a significant flavor. I LOVE cheese, you can pretty much melt any cheese in the world and let me dip bread in it and I would be happy. This cheese was meh. . . The pate was also not particularly tasty. My mom loves pate, and my girlfriend had never had it. I knew she would love it, but when I tasted this one I was surprised that it didn't have the rich flavor pate usually has. . . The steak sauce for the bearnaise was realllllly good, and I loved that! The steak itself was pretty good,but didn't justify the price. I smothered it in sauce and it was really yummy though. . . We were really excited about the French fries, they were more like chips, and they were good not great. They weren't fresh and quickly went cold and soggy. We asked for a fresh batch (one dish arrived with cold fries), and the very fresh ones were excellent... But they sogged up real quickly and were cold. The waitress said it was because the area in the greenhouse area we were in was the "wind tunnel" but it was still disappointing. . . The steak tartare also was just OK. The spices were pretty good, but nothing that wowed or had you excited to take another bite. . . Overall, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the food was pretty decent. However for the price, I expected more, and it didn't help that the service was very slow and we had different servers taking our orders and helping us. It was confusing, and even with multiple people we felt the service was really slow.  . . I wouldn't spend money here again based on this experience, but based on other reviews, I think I'll give it another shot with just my girlfriend and I at some point.
Disappointed in the service, ambiance, & food. Truly had this bookmarked for quite sometime and our lunch visit was mediocre at best. I ordered the mussels with the frites which were all little pieces like the last bit if fries under the heat lamps. . . The pate lacked flavor and the salad was at best 1 star under Cheesecake Factory but as a smaller portion. . . Group of 6+ had auto gratuity so our service level reflected the mediocrity to mirror the food. Wish we ate at Blue Ribbon Sushi as a repeat instead of trying this place.
"My friend Gabi"...is your friend as well ~. . * CMP - French bread = soft and tear-apart, served with butter and carottes rapees. * GET - Brie starter = LOVED it!  Warm melted brie with roasted garlic cloves & toasted hazelnuts.... * GET - Grilled Salmon Salad [avocado, blueberries, walnuts] = light w/ citrus dressing. * GET - Lemon Salmon [asparagus, pea puree] = succulent salmon, served slightly rare in center. * GET - Tuna Nicoise salad = seared tuna with yummy vinaigrette. * MEH - Frites = fun frites in flat shape but man, they were soggy and had no-crisp whatsoever. . * YES - Prompt friendly service. * YES - Full bar right off of patio. * YES - Dark interior seating, airy middle section (with floor-ceiling windows), or outdoor patio seating for people watching. * YES - Great for all: families, dates, business meals, and groups. . * WOA (words of advice):. - Reservations guarantee indoor seating, must request patio ones upon arrival. - Main entrance from inside Paris Hotel (to the left)
OMG!  One must experience the goat cheese w/garlic bread - phenom!!  If there is room left try any one of the steaks - phenom!! Service was awesome, Pinot Noir awesome, and dessert w/latte AWESOME!!
I've eaten here many times. Every time is delicious! The wine list has many great choices. The bread and spread they bring is so yummy. One of the best parts is the prices are very reasonable. And you have the Bellagio fountains for a beautiful backdrop. The servers are always on point. I highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi!!
amazing atmosphere, good customer service.
Solid 3.5 stars, simply because I just ordered waffles with mixed berries for a quickie before I splurge on hopefully a Wicked Spoon buffet lol.. . Texture was to be expected for a French resto, same for the patio view.  Strawberries, blueberries and blackberries, sprinkled ever so lightly with white sugar powder.  A bit on the lean side but i'm being picky.. .   I'm sure I'll return for the dinner to try their favourites as it's a nice date worthy place to go, fancy white linen and all.. . Just did pickup.
It saddens me to see this place go downhill from what it once was.  I always order the steak here, which used to be amazing.  Along with the view of the Bellagio fountain across the street, it would make for an incredible experience. Last time I was here, I had to spit out a good portion of my steak because it was not edible.  It used to be amazing quality here but they raised the prices and lowered the quality.
Love the food.  Service is sometimes lacking.  Awesome view from patio, but they don't take reservations out there, so go early if the weather is nice.
I've been there many times and every time i enjoyed the food the atmosphere and the service. We will come back to this place again for sure.
Maybe it was the lobster roll I ordered , which had tiny pieces of indistinguishable lobster that could have been shrimp , virtually no dressing just a lemon juice flavor , and overpowered with celery chunks , but this place disappointed . I should have tried steak frites but I had steak for the past two days and was hoping for a delicious change.   Any of the lobster roll places in the Bay Area are far better. This would be a one star review but  Plus one for the awesome table in the glass enclosed patio so we could keep cool but enjoy the outdoors in Vegas in July .
We ate here twice during our recent trip.  They are incredible with gluten allergies.  Their staff is well trained, friendly, and attentive.  I had a lamb burger that was out of this world amazing.  We also did brunch there one mid morning.  What a great spot to have a relaxing long brunch!   Food was fantastic both times and the pricing was very reasonable for vegas strip!!
I had the Chicken Pate appetizer ($12) and their Jumbo Crab cake ($18)...was not impressed. I actually didn't see anything that really stood out to me, however, my girlfriend order filet mignon with a piece of butter like spread on top and that was delicious! The meat was very tender and the spread just topped it off. . . I gave it a 3 stars because the other dishes were good. Mine, not so much.. . For starters, they give you a long piece of baguette with some butter. I thought that was ok also. And I LOVE bread. This bread was ehhhh.. . Located inside the Paris Hotel.
Beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains. My cousin and I both ordered the Bordelaise Steak and it was amazing! The service was mediocre. Our waitress never came to check on us, hence the reason why I didn't give 5 stars. But the other staff were attentive when we needed our waters filled. The prices are appropriate for the serving size and the flavorful food.
Mon Ami  was excellent. The bread was warm and flaky, the service was excellent, and they had the most delicious St. Germaine cocktail spritzer that came in a small carafe. . . My only two complaints are that my steak entree came with steak frites but when I inquired about that when ordering, I was told that everything was al la carte. Additionally, the steak was butterflied to my surprise. I'd always rather be told if my steak is going to be butterflied... Sometimes I will change my order when knowing that. But, the Roquefort was delicious none the less.
The wife decided to get all dolled up so how can I not take her to a classy establishment for a great dinner. Funny enough.. This place wasn't my first choice but got chosen because of the fact they open late and we got distracted working up a sweat before getting ready.. . Made a reservation. Got there on time and was immediately seated outside with a view of the Bellagio Fountains. Matt was our main server. I say main because a few others were coming by to help drop off food or clean up.. . We ordered some drinks (Sidecar #43 and forgot the other one) and the country pate to start off with the warm bread and whipped butter. The bread and butter was delicious. The sidecar was extremely sweet which neither my wife or I was a fan of. The other drink wasn't worth remembering.. neither great nor horrible. The pate wasn't bad. It was worth eating but I've had better.. . I ordered the 22oz Ribeye and my wife ordered the chicken. Considering the fact our server talked up cuts and mentioning it was what they were famous for.. I honestly wasn't impressed. I've had far better steaks for far less.. . Oh! I also got the garlic spinach and creamed cauliflower on the side. The spinach was nothing to write home about but the creamed cauliflower was delicious and creamy. Definitely would get again if I were to come back. . . Also one of the server's gaze seemed to come to rest on my wife's cleavage (Clay-VaahGe) quite often. I was going to say something but I do realize how great it is so I let it slide. Haha.
OH MY GOD! . . I had the Croissant Sandwich (the freshest croissant I have ever had). My friend got the Egg white with tomato/avocado Omelette. Super fresh, super good. We shared an order of the French Toast with blueberries & whipped cream - absolutely to die for! The most delicious French Toast I have had....hands down. Service was great too.
Stopped in here for lunch! A great spot to people watch if your out on the patio.
We have dinner at Mon Ami Gabi every time we are in Las Vegas.  Love the Hanger Steak and the service is absolutely outstanding.  Sat on the patio watching the beautiful Belagio fountains.  100 degrees, but with the mists and their air conditioning it felt like 75.  Highly recommended for anyone who wants a great dinner in the best location on the strip.
Thoroughly enjoyed the food and service.
OMgeeee I totally meet up with Bryant M, The fabuleux CM from Columbus Ohio here. Je suis obsede par lui so Mon Ami Gabi was the perfect place for a tete-a-tete! He said it was better than dining with Brittany, who's giant mug was plastered nearby, I beg to differ but was flattered all the same! (No one beats the queen of pop. No one.) . . We cozied up on the patio around 8 ish (So early for Vegas! Mon Dieu!) but the plentiful coffee and juices quickly revived us. He was on a trip to SF, our mother ship, and I was in town for a Yelper Party (Hi Vegas Elites!) so we arranged this run in. Early means it was still cool out and not too busy, as this restaurant is smack dab in the middle of the strip. I suggest reservations regardless: It filled up by the time we finished (10 ish). . . I had a delightful ham and cheese crepe, the sauce was delicious and I ordered a crisp on the outside, soft on the inside baguette with plenty of butter (Dont judge me!) My dining companion enjoyed his meal as well! . . As with all yummy things on the strip, it was expensive for what it was. But that's Vegas amores! One of the better meals I've had on the strip in my many visits.
I've been here at least five times. The view is one of the best views in Vegas. I've never had a problem getting seated on the patio. The wine menu is great, the KIDS MENU is one of the best I've seen. My daughter has ordered three different kids menu items and they all come on portioned plates with a fruit and vegetable. Super super impressed. Wine menu is solid. Service is always excellent! I've yet to try an entree I'd order again (only reason I can't give this five stars), they are all just "ok". But the view alone keeps me coming back for more.
I always come here n I always get the same thing every time since I love it so much! I get the steak n frites with extra butter and it is spectacular! The macaroni auto grantin is always spot on and amazing! The atmosphere is always a good atmosphere! I brought a girl here and it was awesome got some wine n had a goodtime ;). . I forgot our servers name by she was awesome! Always there when we needed it and her hospitality was the best! Bryan was the food runner and no joke I have never met the best food runner ever. He has phenominal hospitality. He took thr time out of his busy time to just talk to us and make sure everything was good. Hes a great gentleman! Keep it up man! Mon ami gabi is awesome!
The ambiance is awesome. The food was good but could have been better. We had the steak frites with the blue cheese. I will go back but next time I'll try brunch.
Someone in our group discovered this place on yelp yesterday so this morning we decided to take the trip down the strip from the MGM and check it out and we are all so glad we did! I had the croissant breakfast sandwich, sounds plain but very flavorful! My friend had the chicken Brie crepe and she loved every bite, another had the eggs Benedict and she loved the balance of flavors and her eggs were perfectly cooked, and finally the gentlemen of the group enjoyed the bloody bar with tons of options and his steak and eggs hit the spot! A great menu with traditional French options as well as great basics. I will absolutely come back here.
I was there before I reviewed places, so I'm not going to be able to give a very fresh review, but this place was awesome I must say. I had the filet and it was terrific, memorable you might say since this was more than a year ago! Hopefully an update will come soon as I would love to go back!
Mmmm, sizzlin'!. . I don't know how we scored an outside table with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountain and the strip, but the view and weather were fantastic! Our server (think his name was Scott) had worked there 10 years and was a pro. Great service and solid advice on a wine pairing. . . I has the filet mignon au poivre and my wife had the bearnaise. Their frites are crazy thin and unlike anything I've seen before. Food was delicious, though I was less impressed by their trademark onion soup, to be honest. . . A little pricey but hey, it's Vegas!
I am most likely biased, but I loved it here. Why? The food was great as was their great wine selection. I also had my wedding reception here. The staff was wonderful and the food was delicious! They were so easy to work with to arrange my reception. Everyone was incredibly helpful. They even made menus with my husband and I's name on them! Their filet mignon is delish!
The one across from Bellagio in Las Vegas is the perfect place to have a glass of wine, French Onion soup, crusty bread and watch the fountains. 2:45pm is the best time to accomplish this.
We had a fabulous lunch here a couple of weeks ago on the 4th of July.  I had the chicken crepe and hubby had the burger. Both were perfect. The service was top notch and the prices were terrific for the quantity and quality of the food.  The ambiance is very nice, I'll bet it's even better at night, and we will be back to see for ourselves on our next Vegas trip, for sure!
Great service, really great wine, good steak....what's not to like? I highly recommend the bleu cheese steak (also the bleu cheese martini). Always love coming here.
I wouldn't expect anything less for a french place in Vegas. They had good options and it was hard for me to decide what I wanted. The server was very courteous. We had a big party and we sat by the window looking out on the strip. They seated us immediately since we had reservations. I would definitely come back if I couldn't think of anywhere else to eat in the neighborhood. The prices were mediocre. Actually I consider it to be pretty affordable for Vegas.
Mon Ami Gabi. . Having a meal on the terrace in the evening sits you right across the Bellagio and it's light show.  Wonderful seat!. . I do have a gluten allergy and this restaurant does a great job at ensuring my safety.. Our waiter and host were friendly.  I'm not much for french cuisine but my friends are.  They loved the food and wine.  My meal was tasty too, large portions I couldn't finish.  I loved their gluten free bread.  I toast the same UDI brand at home but for some reason.  It tasted way better when they did it.. . I would recommend this restaurant.. . I took one star off because the restaurant had a weird funky smell to it.  Perhaps they use an old mop or something.  It was kind of a turn off (I stayed at Encore so I was already wowed by the best).. . Also I wasn't a HUGE fan of the food.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing to me either
I don't know why I haven't checked out this place sooner but better late than never. Went on a Saturday night around 9:30 and it was packed. We couldn't get a patio seat due to wait time but that didn't deter me from having a wonderful experience. Our server was a friendly older gentleman that had to have been there a while. He answered all our questions about the menu without batting and eyelash and steered me towards one of the best scallop dishes I've ever put in my mouth. Nice sear, tender and buttery with a hint of sweet from the pureed butternut squash each scallop was nesting on. My date had the steak with blue cheese mousse that I didn't get to try. I didn't want to mess up my tastebuds with heavy cheese and red meat because I was enjoying my sumptuous seafood so much. We both shared the banana fosters crepe and was surprised how large the portion was. So delicious and not too too sweet, perfect ending to our meal.
Gutes Essen mitten im Rummel von Las Vegas zu fairen Preisen. Gluck hat wer einen Tisch drauen erwischt und so den Blick auf das Bellagio genieen kann.
I had the pleasure of going to Mon Ami Gabi for Mothers Day ,what a delicious lunch,try one of their salads.On such a busy day we still received great service & our meal came quickly which we appreciated as small children were with us. . This is a fun place to eat with great views of the strip. . Penny Z
This is one of my mom's favorite restaurants in town, so we all went there for her most recent birthday party.  The service was great, we enjoyed the waiter's enthusiasm and courtesy. The meal was also very good.  First time trying escargot and I have to say it was quite a treat. The onion soup was also a hit, great flavor with a perfect amount of cheese baked over the top. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because they discontinued my mom's favorite dish, so she was somewhat disappointed.  We all ended up having a great meal and a great time nonetheless and will come back.
Okay, so it's definitely not the cheapest place to eat but MAN is their food worth every penny! Their ham & cheese crepes are super good. So is their quiche and also the lobster roll. The bread for the lobster roll was perfect, warm & not hard.. . They also have a great bloody Mary bar that is reasonably priced but if you don't feel like getting up order 1 off the menu and you will still not be let down. Sooo tasty!. . The #1 reason to head to Mon Ami Gabi besides the amazing food would be the patio seating. First come first serve which is nice b/c it gives you a fighting chance if you're heading there as a last minute decision. But it's the view that makes it THE SPOT! Directly across from the Bellagio fountains and right smack dab on the strip, it's amazing people watching. We always bring any company that cone in town here for lunch, the sangria and tons of great people watching; better than T.V.!
Mon Ami Gabi, you do not make your food with love. Your crusty baguette, in its tres cool paper sleeve, is obviously kept under a lamp, not freshly baked. Your food is delivered to the table quickly & without any pageantry. Perhaps your steaks are spectacular (as I've been told) but I'll never know because your French onion soup is mediocre & your quiche Lorraine is overpowered by chewy bacon & lacks a buttery crust.. . Your patio is 5-stars wonderful, but can I get some quality eats to go along with my spectacular view of Las Vegas Blvd, si vous plait?
I got food poisoning here from eating their quiche. Everyone else in my group was complaining about how their food was bland and all of our plates came out cold (we ordered things like scrambled eggs and French onion soup so it definitely shouldn't have been cold). The service was additionally super slow even though the restaurant was empty besides our group and a few others. I'm not really sure why this place has such high ratings sorryto say it.
Never a bad dish, a sour face, or poor company. I only go there when not even the tables could take me down and it is worked out divine.
We have been here three times and this was the worst experience. Probably won't be back.  They didn't have the drink we wanted to order. They didn't have the appetizer we wanted to order. The fish was overcooked. For dessert the waiter brought the dirtiest dessert menu he could find. What a joke.
I made a reservation on a Monday evening and was seated very quickly upon arrival. . . My friend and I got seated in a dark corner, and the table was wobbly. But we didn't want to let that affect our meal. . . Started off with a fresh baguette with a radish spread, which was pretty good. We both ordered the hanger steak medium rare. My friend's steak wasn't cooked correctly on some parts of the steak, however, mine was great. It came with pomme frites. It was a different type of fries...reminded me of fritos but less crunchy and more potato-y. . . Overall, I felt that I was very satisfied with my meal and the price of the meal.
If you can deal with the crowds and a wait time (evenwith reservations, they will keep you waiting for at least 15 minutes in my experience), this place has an amazing menu and atmosphere.  The hanger steak is my favorite thing on the menu- the sauce is amazing and it comes with fries that are fried in duck fat, which sounds so weird but is so good.  Try the brie appetizer as well, it comes with clover honey and toasted hazelnuts.  Omg.  . . And the view! Perfect place to people watch... and weirdo watch, since the patio is literally 10 feet from Las Vegas Blvd.  Which also means this is not the place for you if you want a quiet night out.
Must Go restaurant every time we visit Vegas! Seafood plater and chicken liver are delicious. Very friendly waiters/waitresses and easy atmosphere. Great place for lunch. Ask for the patio seats in nice weathers. You could see the great Bellagio music fountain across the street.
Overall a really nice experience. If you sit outside on the patio, it's a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountains. You get more of a "Parisian vibe" if you sit inside though, so honestly it's a win-win no matter where you sit. . . The free bread appetizer is literally a huge loaf of bread. Doesn't seem very hygienic with everyone digging in on the same piece of bread, but maybe that's how they do it in authentic Parisian cafes? No idea LOL. . . Ordered the chicken and mushroom crepe. Delicious. Everything on the menu looked good and I would love to go back :)
This is one of our favorite restaurants in town and our go-to place for French cuisine. Great food, excellent service and perfect location... be sure to get seated outside to have a great view of the Bellagio fountains as you enjoy your meal.. . We've been here for both brunch and dinner. Everything on the menu is worth a try. Start your day with their Eggs Benedict and French toast with blueberries. For dinner, any one of their various Steak Frites is a must-try. Other standouts are the Escargot and Mussels in white wine broth. Also a good place to have Onion soup au gratin. . . Best place to enjoy French cuisine without breaking the bank.
Awesome. Salmon eggs benedict not on menu, had it like five years ago off brunch menu. Last year didn't have it on the menu, but asked waiter and he made it happen. Same thing today.  I love this place, we always stop by even if we're not staying off the strip. Just how I remembered. Tried escargot, very good.
We always come here when we are in Vegas.  the outdoor seating is perfect for people watching.. . The breakfast is good.  I recommend the french toast.. . In Vegas, most breakfast is average (think Denny"d, iHop) so its best to pick a place with the best atmosphere.
Went here for brunch on a Sunday morning. We were sat quickly and promptly met by our server who was friendly and knowledgable. . I went with the special (eggs Benedict w filet mignon) and my girlfriend went with the quiche. Both we're excellent. . Eggs Benedict was not smothered in sauce as many places do, the eggs were not over done and the meat was perfect. . . A little pricey, but considering what we've paid for terrible service and food at other locations (LVH), this place is a bargain.
The only reason I rated this "average" is because there was very little to choose from for vegetarian options. I decided on a mushroom risotto dish that was good, but it would have been great to have more choices. The only reason we went here is because we were given a gift card to go, so of course we were going to use it. The inside of the restaurant is very nice--it certainly doesn't feel like you're in Vegas. The service was prompt, our reservation through Open Table was quickly honored (first time using it so I was a bit nervous it'd get lost), and we were treated very well indeed. . . If you're a seafood lover, you'd be in heaven. If you're a veghead, not so much, but at least stop in for a drink.
My favorite breakfast destination in Vegas.
A really nice restaurant on the Strip.  We had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains at night from the patio.  The service was great, but the food couldhave been better. The best was Escargot, but the rest Chicken Pallard & steak were just OK.  Come for the lovely atmosphere....
Mon Ami Gabi why did your hamburgers used to be so good and then fall flat.  Every time I come to Vegas I make it a point to come and get a burger with blue cheese and bacon.   I ordered a medium burger ready for a juicy hamburger.  I received a dry burger that lacked flavor.   The frites were still great as usual.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.
Great ambiance but the steak was very tough. The steak was pricey and so not worth it but the wine was great and the table and service very nice. I would go again, just not to order the steak.
We had breakfast here one morning. Simply wonderful!! Great atmosphere and great food!! Highly recommend!!
Wonderful food, great for people watching, brunch, awesome service. I love the Grilled Salmon & Spinach salad, smoked salmon hors d'oeuvres, Trout Amandine, and Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich.  If you're driving, park Valet.  The entrance is right in front of the restaurant.
good food, great service, the best view, all for a great price!
I LOVE that place in Vegas especially for breakfast. Seafood Crepe is AMAZING!!!!. Highly recommending this place!!!
If you want a nice sit down meal that's a little upscale that won't break the bank, it will be hard to beat this place. The food was interesting (I had the skate, and my girlfriend had salmon), and it was well prepared and the side dishes were different and very tasty.  Nice wine list as well. We'll probably be going back.
