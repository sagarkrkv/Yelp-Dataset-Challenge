We stayed her for our little Staycation night. We got there about 4:30-5pm, enough time to check in, relax for just a bit and then off to dinner before our show. We parked in the back lot, stupid because didn't know better, and since it was just a night we were only lugging around two overnight bags but the walk, otherwise fine, with bags it's not. We couldn't figure out that maize of construction to park in the garage we circled it twice before giving up and listen neither of us lack common sense. Anyway, so on the front desk, gosh! I haven't stayed on the strip since before I moved here and really the check in line at that time! I thought by then it would have been shorter nope! We didn't have time for that s#&^! So back to the car with the bags. **enter long story of our fun night** *Back at the hotel, I wanted to be able to come back to the hotel to crash out from a drunken state and not have to worry about 'business' So I bucked up and tried to act normal. Since we couldn't wait prior, were checking in at about 2am or something late. "We upgraded you to the newly renovated tower" Oh sweet! No! It was right next to the elevators. They didn't have anything else available because we were the late checking in. So we had not choice to deal with it. It ended up not being that bad but remember the drunk part..... . The room itself was nice, it was clean and upgraded and we had a great view of the Linq and surrounding sights. There was a little grim in the sink that you could only see while sitting on the toilet. The bed wasn't super soft and comfy like I prefer a hotel bed to be, it was on the stiff/hard side but not unbearable. . . The thing that got me was that when I booked my room I got a $25 food and beverage credit. After we check in we went to the Mexican restaurant that they have there, Tequila Bar & Grill. I charged it to the room per the manager of the restaurant. We dropped our keys in the express check out. And the next thing I know my card is charged for the food! Grr! The line in the morning were check out and check in and slow just like the night before! So now I have to go out of my way to make the phone which is painfully impossible to get a manager on the phone. Which at this current time I've actually given up on. I need to call again, but I hate tracking someone down. Anyway, the point is when I asked to speak to a manager and the phone rings and rings and they don't even have a voicemail! Is there someone even on the other end? Did you just transfer me to a phony phone number? Lame! . . When we returned to the hotel at night we valet not wanting to walk the walk with the bags again. In the morning, it took 15 minutes for them to get my car. There were people getting their cars that came up after us, we were about to ask about it but then we see my car. The attendant was nice and apologized for the wait that they had the wrong description/wrong space of my car and he couldn't find it. Awesome! . . Can't comment on the casino or much else as that is all we did in the hotel that evening.
If you're looking for a nice decent hotel that has a fair price and a nice size room than Ballys is the place for you. I have stayed here twice already and have enjoyed my stay. The place has a casino just like any other hotel but doesn't have a good Buffett or a shopping mall like the other hotels. If you want a small shopping center and a nice buffet to attend to than there's always the Paris Hotel that's connected next to Ballys. Paris also has a nice casino environment to gamble rather than Ballys. The reason why I'm giving this hotel 4 stars is because of the price and the size of the room. Here's a tip, if you have a large party you want to cram in one room, may I suggest getting the sine King size bedroom because with that you'll get a larger room.
All in all this a great casino to stay at if you're on a budget and want to be at an amazing location. It is located pretty much in the center of the main strip and the monorail stops here. It is also connected to the Paris for a little classier option for food and drinks. The pool is good, however, no outside drinks are permitted so either pay $15 a drink or sneak them in in a pool bag. The rooms were very clean and staff was very friendly and helpful. I would consider staying here again, however, if you are single there are other hotels that are suppose to be more single friendly. . . The breakfast buffet here is absolutely horrible!!! It makes you feel like you are at a holiday inn! I ate it once and never went back and never will. Check out the other hotels or just go to the Paris and get yourself a crepe and coffee. You'll be much better off. They lure you in with $11.99 and the food is not fresh and drinks are not included unless you drink water...coffee and juice is $2. I recommend going down to Fremont street with the monorail and Bus to the Golden Nugget. For $15 you get the most amazing breakfast buffet I've had, fresh omelette, fruit, bread, meat, drinks, and desserts. It's worth the trip down there and Fremont street is worth seeing at least once.. . There is a bar and casino right across the street that advertises super cheap drinks. It's worth going there. You will get a good amount of people watching even though it looks shadey on the outside and loaded for $20.
This is just average. The drink service was poor and of the entire hr we were there no one asked if we wanted a drink. The people at the roulette tables were bland. The highlight for me was playing the digital roulette. That's probably the only reason I'll come here. Also, lots of machines were out of order. I expected more from this place.
This review is just for the casino part of Bally's. Bally's is making improvements to the exterior and finally doing something about those useless "moving" walkways that never seem to move. The plans for it look really nice and I can't wait to go back and see the final product. The casino inside is the same as always. Nothing really stands out for me at this casino though and we probably just visit because we always stay near there and it's on the way to other casinos. The staff at the Total Rewards desk was very friendly when we redeemed some free play. I'm excited to see what the new renovations will bring!
I have stayed here many times in the past. I like this hotel because it is located on a monorail station and because the service is pretty good. I was here on business as usual. I usually stay at either the Planet Hollywood or the adjacent Paris hotels. I would rate all three of these hotels to be about the same. I personally prefer the Planet Hollywood only because it is a little more of a happening hotel.. . The historic Flamingo is a little bit lower only because of it's age, but, I like this location along the strip. As you can see from my pics my Bally's room was 6418, which cost $177 inclusive of all fees. . . Currently Bally's is under reconstruction so the front of the hotel is a big mess. As long as you stay away from the front of the hotel you will be ok. You may not want to stay here if you plan to exit the front to walk the strip. You can't walk straight out as usual , because the moving walkways are not installed yet.
Considering its location, right at the major intersection with Bellagio, Caesars Palace, Cromwell, it's the best bang for your buck as long as you're ok with not the lastest, modern chic decor.  Though I hear the Jubilee Tower is much nicer, but hey for $285 including tax, 3 nites, airfare direct from Vancouver, BC, I'm not complaining lol.. . Not the most fancy lobby.. . Too bad about the movator that's being put out of service temporarily while construction's going on, looks like a mall will be happening.
We went to Bally's to catch a 7pm show of Jubilee! This is not a review for the hotel rooms.. . The casino was clean and there were a lot of options for video gambling (I don't play tables). . . Only downside was that it was tough to find a bathroom from the front enterance.
Nice large room, good location on the strip. Nice that you can use Paris and planet Hollywood pool as ballys is the worst pool area. Great price and $20/day food credit on my reservation sealed the deal
Long lines to check in.  I had to request to speak to a manager.  I got am upgrade for free.  Hotel employees were catering to Platinum and Seven Stars Guests first.  I spend money like everyone else.  So they upgraded me from a basic room to the new Art Decco room with a view of the strip.  It's very nice.  Comfortable beds with a walk in shower.  You can hear the music coming from Drai's nightclub at the Cromwell.  The waiting time for the elevators is too long.  This hotel hosts many conventions.  Be prepared to wait everywhere.
We stayed in the remodeled tower and I have to say I was impressed. I was sceptical going into booking a room here but, once we walked in all my doubts went away. I can't speak for any of the other towers but, the remodeled ones. They have upgraded bedding, televisions, beautiful beds, and really put a lot of thought into the layout of the rooms. I will say this the bed was so comfortable my husband had a hard time getting me out of it that we almost missed our flight. It's also a great location for all the new attractions on the strip as well. Only down fall was the casino....I thought some of the staff was great and others were very detached and almost rude.
My friends and I stayed here in March for my birthday and we had a ball! We stayed in the Jubilee tower which was really nice and in addition to being attached to the Paris hotel, Bally's is also directly in the center of the strip! You can't lose! (Unless you hit the slots, in which case... I don't know). The only downside we experienced is that when we went they were doing construction on the big escalator out front that some other reviewers pictured, but other than that I thought everything was awesome!
Never, ever pay to upgrade your room. They will tell you your room will be nicer...and you will end up with an awful view, the previous occupant's shirt will be hanging in your closet, you won't get the bed(s) you asked for...and when you call to complain?  You will be told, rudely, that you can pretty much suck it.  I am REALLY mad and don't care who knows it.
Bally's property itself is okay, but beware.. . The North side of this tower overlooks a new (and obnoxiously LOUD) dayclub / nightclub called Drai's at The Cromwell. It's a nightmare. Fist-pumping music until 5am! Even with quality earplugs, the noise could not be muffled. And it's making all kinds of noise even in the afternoon so the rooms are unusable from afternoon until 5am! . . Calling the front desk, they tell me that the South side of the Jubilee Tower is "even worse" -- something about a club at The Paris.. . While the Indigo Tower is probably further away but they haven't been refreshed for 10 years. . . Cheap single pane windows aren't helping, but even double pane windows would not keep out the noise. If you like club music in your room, this is the hotel for you!. . If only they could do something about the nightclub -- which is on top of one of their other Total Rewards properties. . . The hotel isn't all that bad but when you can't sleep or rest, it does get annoying.
Considering it was free, I cannot complain too much, and Jimbo the blackjack dealer is fratty and awesome, but there's a good chance if you go to the pool you'll be the best looking person there. Ain't nobody go got time for looking at that for am extended period of time.
I don't have many complaints about this place. The rooms in the south tower floor 7 and 8 were clean and nice. I switched the room after one night as there were people who were loud the entire night in the neighbor room. . The pool is rather small, but the sauna area is pretty good for American standards.. Resort/internet fee is 14$/night. Staff has been friendly.. I had a breakfast coupon for 9$ in food per day. There are two food places I could use it at, which tend to be very busy in the morning. I called and asked, if they could prepare the food and I just come pick it up, but no everyone has to be in line for half an hour.. Valet worked smoothly. I lost my valet slip one time, but it was no big deal. I had to fill out a form and had my car within 20 min.. The location is great of course.
This is where me and my boyfriend stay during our annual Vegas trips.On our last trip in March of this year, the lady at the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful. She also told us Bally's does a FREE shuttle to the Rio and some other affiliated hotels. . . I didn't check out the pools, but Bally's guests also get free access to the Paris pool. I love how there's a small, casual food court (Johnny Rocket's, Sbarro, etc.), it's connected to the Paris hotel, it's pretty decently priced, and the rooms are clean and spacious. It's located in the PERFECT spot on the strip with a short walk to places like Carnaval Court, Caesars, and Planet Hollywood.
Wow... and I mean WOW!!! We booked at Bally's because we got a deal and I don't think this review will express how fantastic our room was! We stayed in room 7206 in the newly renovated Jubilee tower and our suite was GIGANTIC. They say size doesn't matter, but those folks aren't staying in a suite! . . Our room had two queen sized beds, a living room, giant TV, two desks and a rather large area in the corner that puzzled us for a bit. I finally realized that the space is left vacant so guests can request roll away beds via housekeeping. Genius! You spend little time in your hotel room in Vegas so this totally makes sense if you've got a big group of people. In addition to a great view, our room came with mini fridge and fully stocked coffee maker. Right outside our room was the ice machine and . . The location is perfect as it's right across from Cromwell's / Drai's Beach Club, Caesars and Bellagio. A few minutes walk away from great shopping and my favorite pizza at the Cosmo. Although the casino isn't fancy, that's totally okay with me because that means the tables are much cheaper to play at than it's nearby counterparts. Even the pool was wonderful in that it was super chill and great for taking a dip before a night out on the town. The only negative we had during our weekend getaway was the elevators do take awhile sometimes but man, were we entertained by all the characters! . . If you're looking for a sweet deal and perfect location, Bally's is the place for you and your party posse! It's a 1950s relic that's finally stepping into the now. Make sure you get upgraded to the new tower because it'll make all the difference!!!
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #2:. Bally's = well, I thought I would hate this place, but you know, it's alright; I think it defines "average" and "mid-scale" as far as Las Vegas goes, but it would be a pretty nice place in a smaller town; it's literally attached to Paris, which is a solid step upwards vs. Bally's; a decided lack of good dining options - other than the steakhouse, everything is lower-end; the dealer women (not hot chicks) have to wear god-awful uniforms or ugly Hawaiian-style shirts; there's a gay nightclub here, which seems strange in such a non-hip casino; the 26th floor has some mostly empty big conference rooms with good views of The Strip; best craft brew bet = um, not good...maybe get a Rogue Dead Guy ale from the casino sundries shop.
This is my "go to Hotel" whenever I come to Vegas.  The rooms are clean, comfortable and affordable.  The hotel is adjacent to the Paris Hotel and has an aircon walkway with shops, bars and restaurants which line the walkway.  The Bally's is right across from Bellagio and Ceasars.   The Cromwell is also across the street.  Just 2 hotels north, you are at the LINQ where the Bolt Bus stop is located.  This place places you in the center of everything.  Theres construction right now in front of the hotel, but don't let that discourage you from checking in here.  It doesn't affect your stay at all.
I was a little harsh on my earlier review.  SOLID hotel.  But I still have a hang up when I cant get room service for lunch or dinner
Would only want to stay here again if we are able to book a room in the newly renovated section (Jubilee Tower.) Apparently, we stayed here years ago, but I don't recall feeling particularly one way or the other. That indifference remains after our last stay, hence the 3 stars. . . The casual eateries are pretty shitty (Sidewalk Cafe, I'm talkin' to you), but the fancier joints (BLT Steak & Sea: the Thai Experience), which we didn't try, looked promising. . . Love, love, love the location -- connects with Paris & is spitting distance to the relatively newer attractions on the strip (the cromwell, the linq/the quad, the cosmo.) . . Amenity I enjoyed most: being able to use Paris' & Planet Hollywood's pools, which are far superior to Bally's.
