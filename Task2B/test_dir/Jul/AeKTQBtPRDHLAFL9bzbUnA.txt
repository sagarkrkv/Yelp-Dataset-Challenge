Went to goyemon with a large party for a birthday 20+people. They don't take reservations but were able to save 2 separate large tables for us. The all-you-can eat price is relatively cheap so it was busy all night even on a Tuesdays night. We choose to order a la carte because the AYCE menu is basically all rolls with assorted appetizers. The sashimi wasn't the best quality but it's understandable giving the super cheap AYCE price. All the cooked foot was good. Beef cutlet, katsu curry, hamachi Kama,etc. Our total bill was $70 for 2 adults and 2 kids. Definitely worth the price. There was a wait all night so be prepared to wait for a table. It was also hot in the restaurant and our whole was sweating so that took away from the dining experience
Came in. Waiter was alright. Gave me a stair like I didn't know what I was doing. He gave mediocre service. I'm full
In our opinion, the food is pretty good but it lacks creativity. Very few options on the appetizer menu (tuna poki is not that good), rolls are kind of blend too. We come here when we are in the mood for nigiri which are very very decent.
Another one of the best sushi places for all you can eat. I want to say I enjoy the rolls more than Sushi Kaya's however the service when I went here was incredibly slow and there were portions of the restaurant that it seems no server was even attending to.
AYCE is always a must with my group of friends when they come to Vegas. Everything they do here is out of control. Excessive gambling, drinking, and partying. To finish off the weekend, there is also a need for excessive eating since they didn't get much nutrition in their bodies all weekend.. . Food:. $26.95 for All-You-Can-Eat Sushi Dinner. This is probably one of the best AYCE sushi spots that I've tried. The nigiri portions come out small, which isn't much of a problem since it's AYCE! The menu is really extensive. There are plenty of options including the kitchen items. The only items they limit per person is the uni and the ama ebi (Sweet shrimp). . Dessert:. It even includes AYCE dessert: Green tea ice cream, lychee sorbet (AMAZING), tempura vanilla ice cream. They also have green tea creme brulee, but they limit it to one order per person.. . Service:. Wow the staff here are quick! I came with a group of 9 and they brought out everything with alarming speed. I guess it's expected because they only gave us a 1 hour time limit on the AYCE.
I heard the service was bad but food is not half bad.. Understatement the service is Horrendous. Not kid friendly what so ever. . . Let's just say we ended up leaving before we could even order food, my 3 year old daughter was so upset and hungry. . . When being seated I right away told the waitress it was our first time dining there and she completely ignored my comment and took our drink order; note we didn't even have menus yet, so how am I to know what their drink options are. . . There is no sharing with a 3 year old if your doing AYCE. We asked about my friends daughter who is only 5 and she said she would cost $26.95 same as an adult. That is outrageous. Yes we could have ordered ala carte but the server did not even suggest that she just said no there's no sharing and that yep she would be regular price and basically walked away and didn't come back. I was going to pay for the two lemonades she brought us that were basically all ice, but again she never returned and I tried asking the hostess for Togo cups and I would pay for the drinks and she said "oh uh yea we don't have Togo cups" and walked away also. Again note, there were to go lids on the kids cups. So you have lids but no cups? And didn't even bring us straws with our kids drinks. No harm there but it was just too much so we obviously left. . . There are too many other AYCE sushi places to give this place another chance.
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this AYCE sushi. This will definitely be my number 1 stop when I'm in town.. . Wait is long so get there early. Even though they have a time limit, Japanese people are just way too polite to try and enforce that. While We waited the 1 1/2 hours for our table, I could tell that there were people who had definitely exceeded their time limit and still continued ordering and eating.
On high reviews from Michael C, my wife and I headed over here for our last dinner in town.  What a great place!  My biggest knock on the place is the service - once our original drink order was delivered, we had to ask for our waters to be refilled twice.  As for the food, the fish was fresh for the most part (the albacore and japanese white fish were a little on the fishy side, but still edible), and I couldn't believe what all they offered in their AYCE menu.  Salmon belly was phenomenal, and we had a bunch of 1/2 rolls, allowing us to try a lot more variety than we were prepared for.  The green tea creme brulee was out of this world good - and I'm not a huge fan of either green tea OR creme brulee!  Definitely check this place out - if it was closer to home, I'd be here all the time!
The quality the service is top notch. As an ayce sushi it seems we are limited in our location selections and this is one spot I would travel from the very North Pole to eat at. Hands down mine and wifeys favorite.
This is my go-to place for sushi in Vegas.  Every time someone says they have a better place I try that and then come back here.. . The quality of the fish for AYCE is one of the best I've ever had.  They are very busy most of the time, but I've never felt like the wait staff has ignored me.  They are always very nice and the sushi comes out as fast as we order it.. . My favorite part is they have daily specials of sushi such as masago jalapeno and salmon belly, which is SOOOOOO good.  If you go, I would suggest always try something from that list, as it is fresh and different.. . If I had to give a con, I'd say that the bathroom facilities have gone downhill over the years, and there are a lot of things in the wrong place or broken.
I don't get what all the hype is about. This is the lowest quality restaurant of this family of restaurants (Raku, Monta, Kabuto, etc..) Service slow. portions below average, frankly nothing stood out as original or even that good, and mediocre quality. . . Basically its your typical ayce sushi joint that caters to the South west suburban crowd. I can go anywhere and get just as good and easily find better.
One of my favorite past times to which I should stop due to the lack of money is eat all you can eat sushi. Alas eating fresh fish is just too good to pass up. I love eating and sushi is my favorite food so I cannot pass up eating at all the sushi places in las vegas. . . This place is one of the more top notch sushi places that I have been to with fresh fish. I am more of a nigiri man myself which is why I speak about the freshness of the fish. It is very important to me to have fresh fish. The texture of these fish are amazing and have the taste that you expect to come from such fish such as salmon and tuna. . . The sushi rice is also of great texture. Sticks together still in your mouth like it's supposed to. I use my fingers to eat my nigiri and the residue left behind from the rice is minor which tells of great rice. . . The reason for the 4 stars is because if the quality and presentation of the nigiri. The sushi could look better. I usually like to appreciate the food before me but there doesn't seem to be anything pretty about this fish but again this is not that big of a deal. . . This is a great place to go for beginners of sushi. Goyemon has a lot of menu items that anyone of all sushi levels can enjoy. The quality of fish is amazing and can be enjoyed as raw fish or in a roll. Enjoy!
This place advertises that you can get 1 order each of uni and amaebi when you go for AYCE, but it's just a bait and switch tactic to get you in the door. Because what they don't tell you is that if they run out of either of those two "premium" (and they are) items, you can't substitute it for something else of equal or lesser value. So once you're in, they're likely to tell you they're out of one, or both, of those items. That way, you pay the AYCE price thinking you'll be able to get those items, and they don't actually have to serve them to you. All they have to do is keep serving you the same, cheap stuff you can get at any other AYCE, and thereby saving them money, and making more off of you and me; the duped customer.. . It's really ingenious marketing, if you think about it. These guys are brilliant.... at least at making suckers out of their customers!
I try to avoid doing the all-you-can-eats and buffets.  I never can eat my money's worth!  But whenever I'm in Vegas, I try to make an exception and Goyemon is definitely a place where I go all out.  Skip the skinny jeans and put on that billowy dress with the stretchy belt because we're having half the ocean's worth of fish for dinner tonight, kiddies!. . I'm Seafood's worst enemy and I take no prisoners at Goyemon!  Goyemon is my ultimate favoriteplace to go for sushi and it's crazy for me to even say that!  I've taken my brother and friends here and they all go crazy for this place.  Nothing in Arizona can compare.  With uni, sweet shrimp, salmon belly, blue fin tuna, unagi, conch, aji mackerel, garlic tuna, and black tobiko being on their menu, how can I not love this place?  There's so many more amazing bites and everything is fresh [Remember:  fresh salmon should smell like cantaloupe!]!  Even with the all-you-can-eat, they don't try to rip you off by offering more rice and less goodies like a lot of other places do.  It just proves how great their work ethics are.  Don't forgot to check out their ever-changing daily specials.. . Goyemon is a trendy little place and it's nicely decorated.  The wait time can be pretty crazy and they're always busy.  The wait staff is pretty on point here as long as you're nice and polite.  Loud annoying people generally are given much worse service as we've seen first hand with the annoying drunken jerks next to us.  But in the city where clubrats and lushes prevail, I can see how they're just over it.  Stay on The Strip, fiends! Let me just have Goyemon all to myself.  Give me an hour, dim the lights, and don't come in when my stretchy belt is hanging on the doorknob.  NSFW.
AYCE Sushi! SOOO GOOD!. . Got here like 30 min before they opened so me and my group of friends got to sit down immediately when they opened. . . First off we got here for lunch so some items on the menu are not included in the lunch menu. If you do get it, you have to pay the dinner price for AYCE. I wanted to try the pork belly but it was only for dinner.. . Also, you have to make sure you don't overeat. You will be charged for anything you do not eat. Even if you order a nigiri and just eat the fish off of it and leave the rice, you will be charged for the rice leftovers! With that warning, my friends and I were cautious only ordering small amounts at a time. We did pretty good as the portions for the sushi items were not that big and when we order we ordered for the whole table instead of individual servings. . . The highlight for me was the super white tuna! It was really tasty! I would love to come back here for dinner but would want to come here early as I hear the wait could be as long as 2 hours!
This is the best AYCE sushi joint in town. I am here about once a month. Can't beat the quality and the price.
This is my go-to sushi restaurant. The quality of the fish for AYCE beats any other place in Vegas. I love the female mid aged Asian waiter, she is the most friendliest and attentive waiter. She always asks if we want to order more and always refills are drinks. She always has a smile on her face, she's my favorite. If you love sushi you should definitely check this place out. Their menu is great with pictures of what each roll looks like. Definitely recommend.
My go to AYCE sushi spot! . . Tuesdays is when they get their fish deliveries, bet you didn't know that one! . . Try the jalapeno masago with quail egg. DELICIOUS.. Also, miso soup with shrimp heads, haha sounds gross but makes the soup 10x more flavorful.
Pretty good sushi for an all-you-can-eat place.  Always fresh and they bring it out fast.  Honestly, I'd go here more if they didn't charge the full amount for my 4 year old because, seriously, he can only eat like one or two pieces.
Overall this place is the best AYCE sushi place in Vegas. To me what sets this place apart sushi is always fresh and well prepared. They allow half orders on rolls so you can try more different types of rolls. I especially enjoy the different types of grilled fish. After 11pm u can also order ramen they are the same owners of Monta. Sometimes their are premium types of fish on the specials menu you would never see in any AYCE place. Plus it is always busy and plenty of female eyecandy!
I enjoyed it as a first timer. I got the all you can eat and my favorite so far was the hurricane, spicy rice and moon. . . Yum yum sauce whatever it's made of (I even asked the waiter) is amazing.. . I'll definitely be coming back
My husband and I used to work at a very well known sushi spot and after work we would go here with a his friends and coworkers. It's always been very good  and we really enjoy coming here.
It seems like Goyemon has fixed their staffing problems, but I've also switched to mostly just ordering takeout instead of trying to have a sit-down lunch. The food is still wonderful and the staff are very friendly, even when the place is slammed and there's a line out the door.. . Every once in a great while, they still have an off day. Maybe someone doesn't show up for work, or someone who works in the area decides to bring 20 of their coworkers out for a meal. But these are the exceptions, not the rule.
Listen, you can never get better quality sushi at an all you can eat price or quantity, let's get that of the way.  Now, being the foodie that I am, this place gets as close as you can get to as I can ever expect any restaurant can.  It's the best AYCE sushi place I have ever been to. Rice is not mushy, it's cooked perfect. Rice to fish ratio is solid and comparable to a normal sushi restaurant. Service is excellent. Selection is solid and diverse. Go for it, it's a long wait but it's worth it in my personal opinion.
Not only is this place literally across the street from me,  its a great place for sushi! I've had many sushi entrees before here so I thought I would try something different. .. I had the teriyaki chicken dinner (chicken,  salad, rice, tempera, potato salad, miso soup and the cali roll) all for under $10. The tempera sauce is my favorite! I also love the salad dressing,  great flavor. The only downside is the need more servers and for goodness sake all white meat chicken as an option! Customer service is awesome! Also, try the pomegranate sake, its really yummy! I don't like super sweet drinks so I love these!
Came to Vegas for my birthday and we were craving sushi. All the Yelp reviews for this place sounded great and we liked that it was all you can eat. The whole experience was great. It's a small place but we were seated right away and the decor is beautiful. The nigiri was incredible. We also liked that you can order all the rolls in half portions so we were able to try a bunch. The Pastel roll was probably the best sushi roll I've ever had in my life. The Lemon roll was great too. Rice to fish ratio was perfect and the service was great. Their baked mussels were very tasty too. Definitely recommend this place if you're in Vegas and want delicious all you can eat sushi. Lunch was 22.95 I think, not bad.
we always get the all you can eat. my absolute favorites are: spicy tuna sushi style,  steam shumai, baked mussels, ecstasy roll, grilled pork and tiger roll.  sometimes I get the lemon roll, spicy chicken and shrimp tempura.. for desert red bean ice cream...tempura ice cream is pretty good.
Great sushi place, service is fast (most of the time, other days can be slow) but overall I love coming in here for all you can eat! Highly recommend this place.
I came here for the 2nd time. I had a much better experience this time!! All the food we ordered was BOMBBBBBBB. The Fried shrimp head, the rolls (Crispy Rice roll with spicy tuna on top was my fave!!), the baked rolls are good too. I loved the baked  mussels!! They also have UNI (2 per person)! And the Scallop sushi.. i can keep listing!! It's a must try!! The best part, their dessert!!!! The green tea tiramisu is BOMBBBBBBB. Also, they have unlimited MOCHI ICE CREAM!! And lychi ice cream YUMMMMM. . . I WANT TO GO BACK ALREADY!!. . ps. there might be a wait (sometimes up to an hour!) but just wait, its worth it :)
I went back first time in several months to this restaurant. Having only good memories of good quality sushi and well put together flavors construction as well as good portioning. Last night that memory was completely shattered. When ordering the nigiri I was appalled at how inconsistent the fish was cut and the fact that the rice was horrible. They know more practice the art of making a quality product, the evidence to that is a machine that lays out the rice for them so I can slap a piece of cheap nori on it and turned into a very substandard role.. . You might think I'm being somewhat of a snob or a total dick to this place, but after having worked for three years in high end Japanese cuisine and seeing what is possible and also eaten at several other aw IC e. Sushi restaurants honestly have to say in my opinion this restaurant has slipped very very far down the ladder in quality presentation and caring.
Location: 5/5. Close by the freeway off Tropicana and Decatur. Easy to get to and easy to find parking.. . Food: 5/5. Been here multiple times and the sushi has always been amazing. Very fresh. In my opinion its the best sushi spot in Vegas.. . Service: 5/5. Always quick and on point. Orders get taken quickly, drinks are refilled, and food gets brought out quick.. . Ambiance: 5/5. Casual and not very noisy. Very comfortable environment. . . Extra: I will definitely be coming back here again many times.
