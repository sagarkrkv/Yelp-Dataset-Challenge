Outdated remnant from the 70's hostile corporate junk bond takeover of the old mobster Vegas.  Circus' is about due for a good taste of its own medicine.  Please, someone buy and revamp/demolish this casino?!  It has been renovated but never actually updated since the 90's.  It's smelly dingy and awkwardly laid out.  . . There are many activities for the kids.  Most are also outdated.  The rooms are cheap.  Expecting a Motel 6 rather than a resort type room.  I would have to say that this casino, Vegas terms, is embarrassing.  To think international visitors come to our town imagining the City Center but get weasel'd here because of the low price.  . . Embarrassing.  lol
This hotel is very affordable. We got a lot more than we thought we would for the price. The room was well stocked, clean, and came with complementary wifi. The air conditioning worked very well which is important in the Las Vegas weather. The service from the front desk was above average. Personally, I don't like having housekeeping in daily so I just put the "do not disturb" sign on my door and I was never interrupted by housekeeping. Whenever I needed anything I asked housekeeping and I would get it. The location could be a bit better. Overall, this hotel is a great deal.
Decided to stay here for the 4th of July because we have a toddler now and just thought it would be more appropriate. We haven't been to vegas since our wedding in 2006. Vegas has changed a lot, but the hotel has not. There were pubic hairs and other "things" on our bathroom floor and counter. The rest of the room looked as though it doesn't ever get vacuumed, or cleaned period!  If we could have left and got our money back we would have. When we checked in there was no parking available and I mean none, no valet, no self parking, etc....  Unbelievable!!! We will definitely never being staying here again. I just thought this place would cater to kids and be more child friendly, but instead I have to worry about what he's touching every second!!' Nasty!!
tons of fun!!!!!!!!
Absolutely disgusting!  If I could give it zero stars, I would.  The smell is awful.  The main  lobby smells like mildew and the lobby to the room smelled like bubble gum and smoke.  Woke up to a cock roach on the wall.    Never again!  If I ever find myself stuck in Vegas with limited room options again, I'll sleep in my car rather than stay at Circus Circus.
The fam & I stayed here from june 25 to 27th. We simply loved it. Room was huge and we had great service. This was my first trip to Vegas but I'm already planning my next. Thank u Circus Circus
I understand the room was very inexpensive for being in Las Vegas and I was NOT expecting 4 star service at all. But I could not get over how much the staff hates their jobs. It is written all over their faces. The front desk staff was rude-talked very fast, had to ask her to repeat herself a few times, and didn't explain where our room was at all. We got lost going to our room! Adventure dome was as we expected-but it was dirty, and again the staff had the look of death in their eyes. They did not give a crap about anyone; in fact they looked annoyed when my husband stated he wanted to purchase a rock climb and bungee jump for my kids. The food was not worth the price at all! And the coffee maker in my room didn't work. So glad it was one night. So glad I will never go back!!!
Came here for Adventuredome and Midway Circus. Both events are ideal fun for the whole family. The prices for the rides at Adventuredone and the arcade games at Midway are very reasonable. Midway is awesome! The best part is it's FREE! Different acts every 30 to 45 minutes! While Adventuredome has a 10 minutes clown act every hour. You don't have to be a guest at this hotel to enjoy the fun.
My husband and I have been staying here of the past 3 years on our anniversary. We love booking our stay here because of the friendly employees and the location is great. The Adventuredome is automatically 5 stars for us. Not including the Grill, the room and the overall experience. . . Room: Was spacious, quiet, clean and safe. . . Internet: Why do you need internet when you're in VEGAS?? Go out and have some fun! You can be on the internet when you are at home! ;). . Food/Restaurants/Buffets: We loved everything we ate there EXCEPT the Pizzeria. Everything else was great. . . Employees/CheckIn/Out: We had no real big issues. The first time we checked in, we did not know check in was at 3PM, so our room was not ready. We were there at around 11AM and we ended up taking a room that had two Queen/Full beds rather than the King. But we were hardly in the room. We were out roaming around Vegas so it didn't make a difference much. . . Casino: I mean what can you say-its a casino! Slots, tables, people everywhere gambling having fun! As long as I can play my favorite game "GoldFish" then we have no problems! ;). . We will be there again this year for our anniversary! Can't wait!
We stayed here and went to my cousins wedding we stayed for 5 days and enjoyed the amusement park, pizza parlor, sushi, mcdonalds, buffet and my son had a blast in the kids arcade area or carnival area.. . We ordered room service. The steak was delicious and so was the omlets . . Our room was very nice. We had a 2 rooms suite and really enjoyed our stay here.
Went there for a week for business and to see my wife compete in a dance competition.  The room in skyrise was nice and good for the price and was well kept.  I loved the midway and arcade which had fun for the whole family plus shows all the time.  . . It's also close to the strip if you want to check it out but dosn't have all the congestion and traffic of the strip.
Took a taxi to Circus Circus with my wife and child last weekend so my little one could ride the rides. All I can say I'm glad we weren't staying there, it was very dirty inside and smelled like smoke. There seemed to be a lot of families staying there with out of control kids. The arcade and rides were just ok, not worth the money for the taxi but it killed some time and kept my little girl busy a while.
Let me just start by saying DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL... I will give you our experience is short then explain everything in full. Within the first 10 hours we were switched to 3 different rooms, treated like crap by all the employees and rooms smell either like cat piss or dirty trash!!! Okay here it goes:. So this is everything off the top of my head... mix in extreme attitude from the staff as if they hate their jobs and are being forced to work there. 1. We had to walk through the whole casino floor with 9 bags to the check in at 9:45pm. 2. Check in line was 45 minutes which we understand is not their fault they were busy but at least be nice and smile . 3. We go to the far tower with 9 bags to our room and our key doesnt work. 4. We wait 25 minutes in a hot hallway for security to open our door you then acts like it isnt our room as if we are stupid and went to the wrong door and knocks over and over on the door. 5. We have to add our other night online because they couldn't do it at the front desk check in, you can only book a room for that day at the front desks. 6. call guest services to see where we go for a new key, she talks to us like we are a stupid child . 7. We walk back down to the main lobby to  get new keys and to have them mark that we are staying in the same room, they said thats fine . 8. We go over to talk to someone about all the problems and she tells us we cant stay in the same room because someone booked it for tomorrow, so she gives us a new room. 9. We go get our bags and take them to the next room, same tower but up stairs... room smells funny and looks nothing like the pictures and has an old school tv in it. 10. The light in our new bathroom is broken, we say f##k it we havent ate all day so lets go eat first. 11. Its after midnight so everything is closed except a un appealing Deli, Krispy Cream and Vince Neils restaurant so we eat there . 12. Back at the room we call to have the light fixed 2 hours later they still haven't come to fix it  so we cancel so we can go to bed. 13. We wake up and call to have the light fixed. She hangs up on me after I tell her what's going on. 14. We call to speak to a manager, they hang up on us . 15. We call back and demand to speak to a manager, he finally gets on the phone we explain everything he says he is moving our room and dropping the charge for the night. 16. I call bell service while my friend goes down and talks to the manager and get new keys, they tell me to call back because they arent going to come up get the bags and bring them down and then go back up (well what the heck  that's what we have been doing since we get there!!!) . 17. Maid service just walks in no knock nothing and then is bitchy because we are still in the room and she is going to have to come back. 18. We get the new room number, bell man comes up gets  The bags and takes us in a service elevator to our new room which is better then the last but smells like a dirty trash in a woman's restroom (if you know what I mean... dirty sanitary stuff) and again looks nothing like the pictures online. 19. We have to go down stairs because it looks like he charged the upgrade card. He says it is a refund but its in the wrong column of the receipt, they're charge column is actually credits and the credits is actually charges... if this is true why don't they just fix that in the system?. 20. We left a item in our room and called to tell them, they said it hadn't been turned in and to try back. In the next 24 hours before we left we called 3 times and each time they said no it hasn't been turned in or reported. So basically we know it was left on the bed and now our childs doll that we know was left in the bed magically got up and walked away within 2 hours from the first time we called!!! . . The employees are so rude and just when you think something has been fixed for you something else goes wrong and they give you an attitude about it and talk down to you as if some how you being in the hotel is a bother. CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING IS NEEDED BY ALL STAFF!!! . . Mind you my husband (who was not with us) works at a casino in San Diego and he was appalled by everything we were telling him, he said their hotel would be ashamed and be doing everything they could to fix everything and everything would have been comp'd (food everything) not just one night. I wasnt asking for all that I would have been happy with an apology, fixing the issue right away, no rudeness or something. I mean they treat you like they could careless if you come back and like you are bothering them by being there. Mind you we were very passive and not angry or rude at all like we should have been, and like the other people who were down at the front desks complaining!!! I don't like leaving bad reviews but this one is much needed!!!
Did not stay at the hotel but we did stay at the carnival  all day. My son's loved the rides and games it was open till 12am great day great price.
This review is for the Circus Circus Manor Motor Lodge. Avoid the Manor Lodge at any cost! . I finished my two weeks trip in Utah and was heading back to Los Angeles. My plan was staying at Las Vegas for One night and then continued my trip back home. Because it was Friday, every hotel in Las Vegas was expensive. I picked Circus Circus since it had a decent rate. Still, it cost me 134 dollars for one night. When I I booked the hotel, I didn't pay attention to the fact that the room was in the Manor Motor Lodge. Now I regretted my carelessness. The Manor Motor lodge is nothing but a motel.. The motor lodge is separated with the casino and the West Tower. After check-in, you will have to walk a long way to your room, which is not a pleasant experience considering the hot Summer of Las Vegas. The worst part is that the room is outdated. Furniture in the room is exactly what you will expect in a Motel 6 or Super 8. In addition, one desk lamp in my room was not functioning. If you stay during weekdays for 30 dollars per day+ the 14 dollars resort fee, it is somehow acceptable. However, if I spend 134 dollars for one night in this room, I really expect more than motel 6 experience.. If you spend your vacation in Las Vegas, I will suggest you spending a little bit more picking one of the room in the West Tower or going somewhere else.
Warning- Long but honest review for my family's recent stay at Circus Circus Las Vegas. My husband, 2 year old son, and I booked a West Tower room for 4 nights (July 14-18). We were visiting family and our son was with us, we thought the family friendly Circus Circus would be perfect, but we ended up leaving early after a serious incident. . . Check in: Arrived at 3PM, to find a huge line that looked like it would take hours; no surprise considering the time. Kudos to the front desk staff for their quick service - only took 35 minutes.. . Room:  Although our room was updated it was already showing a lot of wear and tear. The furniture had stains and many scratches. TV was crooked. Leaky tub faucet and the light in the bathroom was out. Left a lot to be desired, but considering it is a budget resort, we weren't expecting much. Had clean beds, no complaints. Bell desk was quick getting our bags up to the room, but wasn't very friendly and did not help bring them in. . . Grounds: The resort is a zoo with a constant flowing sea of children. Not an issue for us, but could be a major con others. Grounds are reasonably maintained, if a little dated. There is an issue with casino and Midway location. Children are to stay out of the gaming area, but the location of the Midway is above the casino and the only access is in the middle of the gaming floor. Not only is this inconsiderate to players, it is confusing to kids. That aside, the circus acts were amusing, games were reasonably priced ($1 or so), and the operators were fun. Location not an issue with the Adventuredome as it is located at the back of the property. Lots of rides for a reasonable price if you buy a day pass. Perfect for those with kids. . . Casino: Visited when Grandma asked to babysit our son... We always enjoy the casino at here. The dealers are super friendly and they have $5 blackjack. Slots seem pretty loose. Cocktail waitresses are outgoing and fast. It should be noted that they don't use brand liquors, but drinks are still free to players. You can usually get your standard beer selection. . . Food: Restaurant variety that is able to accommodate most tastes. The buffet was your standard buffet at a decent price, but pretty limited for those diners with dietary restrictions (I'm gluten free). However, they did whip up some custom dishes for me and made sure to take special care. Our bus person was also very helpful and attentive. Despite the mediocre selection, our buffet experience was quite exceptional due to the hard working staff. . . We were having a pretty great time at Circus Circus. However, on the 3rd day of our stay that all changed.... . On Wednesday, July 16th, we decided to spend the day on the Strip. Before we left, we neatened up the room, made sure our bags were closed and out of the way, all to make it easier for the housekeeper. When we got back, our room had been cleaned and seemed in order. That is, until my husband opened his bag. He had a money clip in the bottom of his bag with $600 exact. We use this as our gambling money and only remove cash in $100 increments (we're VERY meticulous). While out he realized he forgot to lock it in the safe after the previous night, but didn't think it would be an issue since it was in the very bottom of his closed, packed bag. When he checked after we got back, his money clip now only had $440 and his clothes looked as they had been moved. Nothing else in the room was disturbed. If someone broke into our room, other things would have been gone. Someone was trying to hide it as it appeared they attempted to put everything back in place. In our minds, the only person who could have done this is the housekeeper.. . We immediately called security. They said someone would be right up (took 45 minutes). The security woman apologized for the delay but was very thorough and attentive. She explained the investigation process and told us to contact risk management in the morning. We contacted them the next morning and were told there was "nothing we can do" and "this is why we provide a safe". We know we should have used the safe (honest mistake), but we should be able to trust the staff not the go through our bags and steal from us. They told us the investigation would take a minimum 10 days. We understand the process takes time but we asked if they'd do anything to help in the mean time. We still had 1 night left and this really soured our trip. No offer to make it right, no refunds, not even a real apology (just "sorry, you should have used the safe"). Victim blaming is not an apology!. . We went to the front desk to see if they would be willing to do anything. The manager there too said there was nothing they "could" do and offered the same "apology". . . We immediately checked out, went to Harrah's, and were very happy. It's a shame we couldn't even get a real apology from Circus Circus. Their loss. We go to Vegas at least twice year and have a growing family, their key demographic. Obviously, we won't be back.
Went for vacation early 07/2014, we stayed in the West tower, the room was great, and the hotel workers was very helpful and nice. Would love to stay at this place again. The Buffet was great, food was hot and delicious unlike Studio B where the food was cold. Would recommend this to families with young children. . Adventuredome was a blast. If you get coupons from online, or two-for-one buffet- be sure to go to the players club first and cash them in--saves you a few steps.  Can't wait to go back.
Stayed here on my most recent trip to Vegas.    Never again!   The place is old, smells and dingy.. . Also somehow I managed to end up at the only hotel in Vegas that was filled with Kids!!!   REALLY!!??   I'm in Vegas to get away from out of control screaming kids, not multiply them by TEN MILLION!! . . The pool was so disgusting and filled with screaming kids who are no doubt still urinating in the pool as I write this.  Gross!!   I had to leave and went around the corner to Sapphire Adult Pool & Day Club.   Wow - now that place was great.. . Anyway back to the Circus.     The thing that was great about this place was the free valet parking.  Otherwise it sucked.     Stay away!
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. It is far from the fun of the Las Vegas trip, is old looking and just an all-around bad hotel. . . My family and I stayed in the Casino towers which is in the main building and I was very unimpressed. The room was not fully cleaned when we first got there; there were little bits of trash in the bathroom/closet area, as well as hairs in the sink. The beds were also not very soft and the sheets were kind of stiff. There were few electrical sockets to plug in our phone and other electronic charges-- we had to unplug the alarm clock and lamps in order to charge our things. The toilet in the bathroom is scary... when you flush it, it makes this majorly loud vacuum sucking sound and is pretty startling. . . I understand that this hotel is more of a kid-friendly option, but goodness there are a LOT of kids running around, bumping into you, unaccompanied. It was very annoying trying to get from one point of the hotel to the other with all the kids running around, and even adults who didn't seem to know how to walk and would just stop in the middle of the walkway. . . One thing that really stunk about this hotel is that it is so far away from all of the major tourist attractions on the strip. You pretty much have to take a taxi everywhere or buy a bus pass for the strip. It is at the very, very end of the strip and walking to any of the other hotels is pretty much out of the question, unless you are good with walking longer distances to places. . . We did not stay in the manor, so I can't really discuss that but one of the taxi drivers we used one day told us that the manor is definitely a place to avoid because of the criminal/sketchy activity that goes on around there. We also did not eat in any of the restaurants, so can't really discuss that either.. . The midway area was pretty cool, VERY crowded but neat. I didn't catch the circus acts, which was a bummer. The pool there that I saw seemed REALLY tiny. Not nearly big enough for all the people staying at the hotel. Plus, I was a little weary about how sanitary the pool/pool area was considering the inside of the hotel was not great.
I was anticipating a great experience at this Hotel with my friends and family and was very disappointed. From the moment of check in they wanted to charge me 10.00 for checking in early, which I asked to be waived and they did comply. There is a 14.50 per day resort fee and they give you a booklet of useless coupons that give you no good deals at all. I understand the hotel has been around a while but there is no excuse for the the musty rooms and filthy, not dirty, yes filthy carpets. The rooms are outdated, nasty, and even the coffee maker was dirty with coffee grinds from a previous occupant!!! My sister experienced a dirty coffee maker as well. Someone with my group had a room of bed bugs. His back was covered in bites!! They gave him a new room and did offer to laundry his clothes. His next door neighbor had a bed bug issue as well in the West Tower. Walls are thin at Circus Circus, I had a neighbor that was having a party and screaming out sexual favors and pleasures a big part of the night. This place is definitely not family friendly in my opinion. Prices are outrageous specifically for families, and the restaurant food is 2nd class in taste and price. I experience cold food, and stale tasting drinks and we ended up having to go outside of the hotel to eat our meals. The restaurants as well as the Casino have no idea of what clean and sanitary means...So sad because this hotel is Iconic in Vegas, but could use a makeover in Management, customer service and cosmetics.. I will never recommend or go there again...A big let down for my family and group of friends(about 20 of us), and we traveled from Texas for this occasion....Hope anyone that decides to go will have a better experience than we did!!
If you got kids this is the place to go. Parking lot is very tight and it gets packed like crazy. It's best to go early in the morning rather then the middle of the day. Games are fun, everyone enjoys it, and that's what really matters.
I mean...I get it, it's the only like fun place dedicated to kids. But there's literally 500,000 kids everywhere at all times! I mean, it probably didn't help that we were visiting during the Junior NBA's and I think they were hosting it. So I mean, make a wrong turn and feel like a sardine in a can. . . So the pros about CC: my kids liked it here. . . The cons about CC: my kids liked it here. . . The games are like fair games...you keep playing trying to get the bigger prize. The employees look unamused to be working there. They look like they wish they could be anywhere else, other than there. I'm not sure if I blame them. NOTE: if you have multiple kids, make sure to bring the bank roll. Or deal with some seriously disappointed kids with their flower prizes. . . They have shows that happen maybe every hour and a half. We got seats for the scarf arial dancer. My kids liked watching the girl do that. An employee walks around selling popcorn and cotton candy. Kinda gives you that circus without the animal smell feeling. . . We didn't go o adventure dome...but I'm not too sure my kids would be into that. I believe it's $30 for an all day pass. They have a McDonalds in the game area...of course they do. Well played, Circus Circus, well played. I'd probably never stay in this place...but it's a good place to let your kids run wild for a few hours.
Within the first 5 hours of going through the casino and pool, a 10 year old asked me for money, and an 80 year old made a racist comment about my 2 year old child. I know this isn't exactly the hotels fault, but this is what to expect when your paying minimal rates to stay in Vegas I guess. Everything else was just ok. Really, it's just a place to lay your head to sleep. In and out is your best bet. . . My wife and kids left after our initial 2 day stay and went to Luxor....head and shoulders above Circus Circus, at just a little bit higher price.
For the price I payed to stay here ($200+ for one night) I was pissed at the poor quality. Yes it is on the strip but it is right at the very end and in the Vegas heat not really walking distance. Also I was put up in the "manor" rooms which meant that the room was in a separate building a good 5 min walk outside from the front desk and valet. The manors looked and felt exactly like a cheep motel any where in the country and the hallways and room (which was non smoking) both smelled. The free Wifi was so slow I could barely check my email and the bathroom and sheets where awful.  . . Also because it is "family friendly" the place had none of the class and elegance I had previously experienced in Vegas. If you are an adult traveling with out children there is no reason to stay her, either save your money and stay off the strip of for $50 more stay in one of the much nicer hotels just down the road.
