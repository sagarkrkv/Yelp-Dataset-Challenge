My favorite place for shrimp tacos and elote. I got my tacos to go today. When I called in my order it was taken in a friendly, efficient and professional manner. My food was ready for me when I arrived 10 minutes later and I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. The tacos were superb, as usual!
A friend and I stumbled onto Gallo Blanco after shopping in the area and a woman in a store was raving about it. It was a Tuesday which meant all day happy hour! The restaurant itself had a cool vibe, very open and lively. We also checked out the Clarendon hotel it's attached to as well and it was very cool, we would definitely stay at the hotel.. . As for food and drinks, we split the pitcher of sangria (fantastic) and the large guacamole ( great and on happy hour). My friend had the salad with chicken (can't remember the name) but it was unique and flavorful for a salad.  I had a shrimp and fish taco since they are street style. I preferred the shrimp, but both were great, and only $5 for both!! I will definitely be back and recommend it to anyone!
This place got crowded as heck around 6pm when I came in. . I stayed at the hotel for several days so I tried a couple things off the menu. . I tried: Naco Torta, breakfast burrito, Pica Rico burger, guacamole, shrimp taco, and the Funkin' Gonuts Coconut Dunkelweizen beer. . . If you only get one thing at this restaurant, get the Funkin' Gonuts Coconut beer. It was so good and so unique that I asked the bartender to take a picture of the beer tap handle with my cellphone because I wanted to remember the name when I got back home in Los Angeles. I found out that the company that makes this beer has been in business for only a couple months and distributes only in Arizona. Can't rave enough about the beer, so good. . . The Pica Rico was also super delicious especially because of the grilled pepper inside. It went nicely with the beer. . . Guacamole was okay for me actually. The shrimp taco was also good, but I tried better. And the Naco Torta was excellent when you try it with the eggs done over easy. Lastly, don't get the breakfast burrito. That was a definite miss for me.
Glad we drove over from the PHX airport for dinner. The place is located next to/inside the Clarendon hotel. Upscale Mexican fare, very nice hip ambiance with a fantastic live band tonight. The food is very fresh and looks like is also locally sourced. . . Drinks: The margaritas are not super strong but still very delicious. I got the AZ margarita, and could taste the prickly pear in there. Usually not a big fan of margaritas due to it usually being too acidic for me; but these were just the right balance of sweet and sour. Husband got a dark beer, also solid. . . Food: we got the cotija corn and guacamole for apps. The corn was BOMB, I tell you. It was the star of this meal, not to be missed. A simple dish that we will probably make for at home bbqs in the future, but nonetheless exquisitely executed here at gallo blanco. The guacamole was good and fresh but nothing too special. . For mains i got the carnitas, carne, and tilapia tacos. All very good but carnitas were me favourite. Nice smokey flavor and very tender and juicy. Carne Assad was a close second, also packed with flavor. Husband got pollo asado, which was also very flavorful and fall off the bone tender. . . Overall the dining experience here was fantastic. Our server was also humorous and just the right amount of attentiveness. Would definitely come again if in the Phoenix area.
The guacamole was amazing and the tacos were good. Only complaints, was a bit loud, parking isn't great and it isn't very kid friendly.
Came here by mistake again. Same bad service. Never again.This place seems to rely on its popularity without concentrating on customer service.
Honestly, the service can be hit or miss but the food is the BOMB.COM! Get the naco torta, you can't go wrong
Food is delicious, ambience is fantastic! Intimate enough for a date, lively enough for a night out with friends.
The fish tacos came highly recommended....pretty damn good, but nothing life changing lol. I've had better in Cali. My cocktail was also pretty good but light on the alcohol. I would go back because they definitely had a creative menu and I should've ordered something I couldn't literally go get off a street corner lol. The guacamole was good though. I can't front on that. 3.5 stars but I can round it up to 4 over 3.
All I can say "Great service, fast, friendly, delicious" good price. It's a must if you are in Phoenix, AZ. I say go for the gold and it's at Gallo Blanco!!!
Okay. I love Gallo Blanco, particularly for breakfast. It's different but familiar, if that makes any sense.. . We usually order the breakfast burrito (unbelievable) and the flap jacks (best I've ever had). They serve local coffee, have awesome drinks, and usually pretty good service (probably the only complaint I've ever had was being ignored for a little bit during happy hour, for which we got some free chips and salsa as an apology). . . I just need to come here for tacos. It's really a shame I haven't been.. . If you like midtown, it's an awesome location in the Clarendon hotel. Hipster in a good way. I doubt you'd be disappointed with anything you ordered here; it's all fresh and made in house where possible. Also, prices are very reasonable.
Been wanting to go here for a while. It was a little busy but got a nice table in the lounge where the band was setting up. Ordered some tacos. Carne asada and pork were just ok, the shrimp was decent. Overpriced beer ($17 pitchers) but were willing to pay that for the ambience. Unfortunately, it was hot as f*** in there. Oh, and when I ordered a bottle of Bud Light, I got a can!!! Going to America's Taco Shop next time for amazing carne asada!
Loved the food, but the service was awful.  . . Totally ignored and my husband had to get up and walk to find someone to take our second drink order.  Also, very loud with the concrete floors and cinder brick walls. . . Lots of staff, but poorly trained on how to take care of customers.
Happy Hour Tacos... OK tacos anytime, OMG.  They are served in a cool serving tray, and they are just great and reasonably priced.  Have a variety, but take advice from wait staff.... . Also, cocktails by the pool is also advisable.   . . Have fun!!!
A fantastic place!. . Tuesday night was a 15 minute wait to be seated, but I sipped a pint of local beer and watched the end of the all star game from the bar until, the hostess kindly dropped me off at the best four top in the house.. . Tuesday is happy hour all day. I had 4 Baja-quality grilled fish tacos (2 halibut and 2 local pork/cochinita), the best elote I've had north of the border and another beer for less than $25. Loco!. . On top of honest, delicious food the service is impeccable and your feel like your eating with friends. . . They're even open for breakfast!. . I'll be back!
....I know some of you will hate me on my rating, but I can only give this place a 3. I don't see what the big hype is about this place, I've had better. I don't like how noisy this place gets either, it pretty much made me quite miserable, (...unless I ordered a few strong drinks, then I'm sure I probably wouldn't have minded as much!)  ; )
Wednesday nights are the best in my opinion for the flamenco dancing. Love the drinks and love the food.  This is one my my long time favorite places.
The food is awful. If you haven't tried real mexican food you may like it, otherwise you will be disappointed as I was.. The place seems to have a good atmosphere but then you will realize that it is as any other restaurant.. The worst was Chicharron de Queso and the Bloody Mary. The ingredients were not fresh.. We waited like an hour to get a table inside on Sunday afternoon. Then, the hostess asked us to accept the table outside, otherwise we should wait more time.
Worst service ever!!!! We sat at the bar. Horrible choice. We ordered drinks and then watched the bartender make about 10 drinks for others before we got ours. While eating our tacos, which were fairly good, the couple next to us started fighting- including the woman yelling and storming out twice only to return to keep fighting- and the bartenders did NOTHING!!! Totally ruined our experience. We'll never go back!!!
I had the guac dip. It has a citrus twist....not bad. Then I had their tamale. Great for a veggie entree. I hope there's a tamale with meat one day. Their "street tacos" are pretty tasty. We sat outside, which offered a great view of the city night light. The service was nice!
Gaawwwwdddd!  I love this place.  Very mod urban vibe. The guac is prob one of the best I've had. Everything is wonderful. Love the selection of salads they are huge and savory, not just a average salad.
We went last night for the flamenco show and I was excited to experience the urban atmosphere.  The service was ridiculously slow (15-20 minutes for drinks) and it was insanely hot!!  When we left at 10pm, it was the same temperature inside as out.  The flamenco dancers were absolutely amazing but we will see them again at other locations.  Definitely won't be back which is disappointing because their menu looked good.
