So we're in Vegas and have no clue were to get a GOOD burger... emphasis on good. Yelp to the rescue! Burger Bar was close enough and we were on a mission! Got seated right away and everyone else's food looked and smelled amazing. Yes! I ordered the American Classic Burger (no time to mess around - note: the menu was quite extensive). We did have to wait a little while, but were periodically assured, with a smile and a drink refill, that food was coming. :)  And POOF there is was. This glorious, wonderful plate of cooked cow, lettuce, bacon, cheese, bun and steak fries!! Soooooo so good. I was totally stuffed and kept eating... and eating. Good job guys! A very nice and memorable experience for sure.
Burger Bar sits on the pool front of the Mandalay Bay Resort in Vegas.  It's a convenient restaurant that has the typical salads, burgers, appetizers, and small entrees.  It's a convenient place at the hotel. . . We ordered the cheese quesedilla, which came with sour cream, fresh salsa, and a type of guacamole sauce (looked like a green mayo).  Typical quesedilla.  $12 (OUCH on the price).. . A side order of fries was $5.. . I ordered the cesar salad with chicken ($16) and asked for some onions to add to the salad.  The salad was nicely prepared, but the salad dressing tasted a bit cheap and bland.  I only ate half of the salad.. . Best thing of the meal was the great customer service from Heather.  She really took the time to be patient with our tables and she was very helpful throughout the meal!  Thanks a bunch!. . Food Grade:  C. Service Grade:  B+. Worth the money Grade:  C. Overall Impression Grade:  C
Excellent atmosphere that really screams vegas. It's a great way to kick off your trip. Their shakes are to die for. Typically we get a burger and split the Cobb salad.
Needed a place to watch the world cup while enjoying lunch and conversation.  There was a short line, so sat at the bar.  Friendly, responsive staff. The burger was great ... Added spinach which was made to perfection.  Would definitely recommend.  Look forward to trying the other proteins.  The beer selection works as well.
Awesome build your own burger joint. Sweet potato fries rock. Great beer selection.
I would say 3.5 as well. . . I got a basic cheese burger. Everything else seemed to fancy. Had too much. The basic cheeseburger was good, but it didn't blow me away. Prices were high as well. It's vegas though, so I suppose it is what it is. . . The appetizer sampler was good, but game in a kitchy tri-serrving cone and felt that there should have been more.
They Changed a few things on their menu. They change the Veggie and Turkey patties. The new ones are not that good. Lower quality.  Use to be our to go place. this is gonna change us coming once a month .  Looking for a a better burger joint.
Yum yum and more yum. We ate here last year and it was great so thought we'd try it again this year and definitely not disappointed. I had the vegan veggie burger (I'm not even a vegan) which was grilled eggplant, capsicum (I think you call them red peppers here) zucchini, on a mushroom cap bun (no bread) and it was delicious and super filling!! My partner had the All American Classic which he loved as well. . The service was fabulous despite being packed and even allowed me to change my skinny fries to sweet potato fries a few minutes after I ordered without a hiccup. They had a great service where instead of just waiting they just messaged us when our table was free and we were seated 2 minutes after we put our names down. . Will we come back here? Definitely!!
Waygu beef burgers to die for!    Went twice on this trip, last nights service SUCKED!  She left our order sit or something, because the buns were all dried out and crispy on tip and soft on bottom by the time we got our order.  We had to ask for refills, etc.  From the time we walked in until we got our meal it was 45 minutes!  Missed the twins both nights!  Ask for one of the twins and you'll have an awesome experience!!!!!  I'm knocking off a star because of the slow, unfriendly, ridiculous service last night.
I decided to take out from here while staying at Mandalay.   Good Burger!  I had the Traditional American with the fat fries.   It is a gourmet burger so expect to pay more than usual.
Tourist trap. No way I'm paying 30 bucks for a burger I can make at home for $7.50.
Great build your burger place
Hubert Keller has the Restuarant  biz down.  Bartenders are the most personable,drinks amazing.  Not the typical Vegas tourizm  Restuarant.  You get the fill of a local hang out .
Honestly as I was eating the burger it wasn't even that good. Def not worth $20. The second I left I felt sick. Nonstop vom for days. It was the first place I went to off the plane ruined my whole trip. DO NOT EAT HERE MADE ME A VEG
Great Sweet Potato fries!!!
MAKE YOUR OWN SHAKES, SAY WHAAA?! Bomb.com. Went here for lunch and they are packed. I can see why. There's was a 30-45 minute wait, but it was most definitely worth it. The person I was with order the veggie burger(very inexpensive & still good), the jalapeno appetizer, fries, onion rings, and their special burger($20 burger). Wow, best $20 burger I have ever had and I've had Gordon Ramsay BURGR. Most def recommend if ur willing to spend $ on a burger and shake!
I would say 3.5 but with this one had to side with the 3.0 mainly due to the fact that service wasn't that good for the price that you pay. . . The burger's weren't cooked correctly the first time out but once they came back after a disgusting look from the waitress for bothering her when she was too busy to help were delicious.. . The pricing was also very high for a basic burger, I actually would prefer in and out or Five Guy's Burgers over this place due to the price and the service.
Burgers, beer, sweet potato fries.... what more is there to say!?  Every trip to Vegas has me coming by here and I really, really enjoy my meals each and every time.  Service is prompt and friendly, no complaints there.. . Cooked perfectly, great fresh toppings and fully customizable.  This is not a new concept by any means but to be in such a high volume location like this and to be able to turn out consistent quality is a testament to their standards.. . I stick to the Kobe Burger and add on various toppings/sauces when I come here and I would recommend the same.  Don't forget the fries, sweet potato fries here are amazing!
I had a "regular" cheeseburger, adding foie gras to the mix. Never tried foie gras before, but the mixture of the foie, the cheese, and the perfectly cooked and seasoned beef was delicious. The fries were not bad, but nothing totally exceptional. However, the burger is enough to make one come back (should I head back to Vegas anytime soon).. . The waitress was friendly, answered all of our questions prompty and in a relaxed manner (during a busy lunch hour), and couldn't have made the experience any better.. .  To continue this thought, I am not a huge beer drinker (prefer Whiskey), but both my buddies said the beers that the waitress recommended to go with their burgers fit perfectly. . . I don't head out to Vegas often, but when I do, I would not be abject to stopping by here again (and getting the same foie burger as last time)
My family and I were in Vegas for the week.  We ate at Burger Bar our first night in town.  While I am normally not a huge burger fan, I ate every bit of my Kobe burger.  It was cooked perfectly and was delicious.  I think the shakes after dinner were the hit of the experience my children ordered a kid friendly shake and my husband and I enjoyed an adult one.  Both were huge, but amazing.  We made the right choice in ordering one to share.
Would give 4.5 stars if I could!  Yelp you need to make this change to allow for .5 stars!  Anyway, stopped for a beer before hitting the foundation room at Mandalay Bay and stayed for an early dinner.  GREAT beer selection on tap!! We had the Hubert burger and wedge salad.  Both VERY good.  Wait staff was superb.
Meh.... I went here with my boss on a business trip.  I just don't understand why anyone would want to eat a hamburger while at Vegas.  I have been to this one and the one in San Francisco and I am not impressed with either of them.  Honestly, I think "5 guys" has a better tasting product.. . Go to the Burger Bar, everyone else on Yelp loves it!  Maybe it was the company I kept that made the experience 3-stars.
Always a must-stop on any Vegas trip. This was one of the first design-your-own-burger places I ever encountered, but of course now other places with the same concept are all over the place. However, this one is still doing it on a grand scale and better than any other I've run across. There are such vast selections of meats, breads and toppings that anyone can find something that can become their perfect burger. For me, it's bison meat on ciabatta with bleu cheese, spicy mustard, caramelized onions and spinach. With a side of shoestring sweet potato fries, of course. Oh, and a flight of IPAs from their massive beer selection. Service is always incredibly friendly and these folks know the menu options well. It's almost always crowded and there's often a wait for a table, but I've had good luck stalking the bar and grabbing empty seats there.
Best shake sampler on the planet!!!
Burgers are outstanding!  You must try the pretzel bun!  Then make sure in a group you try the different fries, onion rings, zucchini, etc...  The dessert burger was delish!  I absolutely loved the glazed donut burger idea.  So fun!. I gave it 4 stars because they charge for every part of the burger.  Be prepared to spend $15 for just the burger.  Its a pretty big burger and so delish.
mmmmmm
This is a fun little place after a day of swimming at the bay. Gets crazy when conventions are in town.
I love a good happy hour and this place hit the spot. I needed a snack between brunch and dinner so we found a few chairs at the busy bar. Super nice bartenders and a very simple happy hour menu. Perfect!
I was really hoping for a five star restaurant, but at the end the terrible service made me regret ever stepping foot in this establishment. Our server Harmony seemed like she hated her job and not very knowledgeable in regards of the menu. Additionally she was very rude and had a bad attitude. The food was delicious, but did not makeup for the experience.
REVISED 7/24: I would like to re-state my love for burger bar, but do have one revision. I revisited my favorite burger spot with two kids and they were disappointed in the kids menu. The kids menu stated it was for 12 & younger, but when my two nieces 10 & 11 asked "Is this it?" They both decided to order & split something off the regular menu. Burger Bar did redeem themselves by splitting the burger and fries for us and as always service was great, but just a heads up if you take kiddos.
Bad service ! Bad meal ! Way overpriced ! Atmosphere , BORING !!! Should have known when tables were empty of people ! ordered burger with cheese , when I got my meal , no cheese . When I told waitress of mistake , she went to get a slice of cold cheese for me to to add ! This is a 15 dollar burger ! When I mentioned it should be returned and cheese added , she did ! Food came back with cheese and bun stuck on top half way ! Cheese was stuck to bun ! I've warned you , do not eat at this here ! Spend your money at a nice restaurant !
Burger bar is a great spot for good and also very different varieties of burgers. The staff was friendly and I got my food very quickly. If you're ever on the strip and want to try a burger joint in a laid back and more relaxed setting, this is your place!
I was enjoying my vacation till I stopped by the burger bar Jessica our server was less then pleasant and Scott the manager would not honor the happy hour specials think twice before stopping by for happy hour. Food was great though!!
