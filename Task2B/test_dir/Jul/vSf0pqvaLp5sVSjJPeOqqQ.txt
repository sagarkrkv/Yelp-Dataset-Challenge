My wife and I recently enjoyed a wonderful dinner with great beer choices and superb service. The moment we walked in everyone was attentive and friendly. Our server, David was personable and knowledgeable . We ordered a couple beers and a lobster cocktail and ahi tartare. They were delicious. Our entrees, cioppino and a rib eye were equally delicious and right on time. The cioppino was the best item of the meal. For desert we split the bread pudding that was to-die-for good. We go out often to different establishments throughout the valley and this one we'll be back to for sure. 5 stars!
While staying at Aria we've come to Todd English twice-once for dinner and once for brunch. Service was great both times and the drink selection was huge. The food, however, is so rich, your arteries gotta be vegas millionaires to afford it. My friends all got sandwiches that came with large buckets of fries which were amazing and probably the best part of all the meals. For brunch I got the lobster eggs benny, which was a huge, super sloppy, bowl, loaded with an overwhelming amount of beef (why?) and a good amount of lobster. I ate all the lobster, which was delicious, and called it quits. The build-your-own bloody mary selection was great and essentially can be meals in themselves. Over all worth a try, maybe get a salad if you're not into channeling your inner Guy Fieri that day.
Yumsville!!!! This place is perfect. Great menu, friendly staff, & awesome decor/atmosphere. . . We ordered lobster roll (omg) I mean great taste & big portion & then we had the house made foot long hot dog w/chill & onions. Best dog I've eaten. Their house bread is perfect. . . There is something on the menu for everyone. Great beer selection. . . We happened to be there when Netherland & Argentena started the semi final soccer game. We got a perfect table facing the screen. . It's huge must if your eating in. Vegas.
Excellent happy hour and unique menu that is full of surprises. . . Great appetizers, beer and atmosphere.. . Chad C. was our professional server, he was extremely helpful with regards to their happy hour options.  Chad is an asset to the staff and should be commended for his excellent service.
Time to update! . . Keeping this at a solid 4-stars... the Happy Hour specials (3p-6p & 10p-12a) are excellent. Half price beers (great beer list!) and $2 oysters? Sign this girl up. We tried to go here at 11pm one night, but they told us the kitchen was closed, so just note that the 12am end on the happy hour may not be 100% accurate.. . I had the lobster tacos & some oysters during this visit. The tacos were OK, next time I'd get something different, but the oysters were fresh & were really great. Our server was super nice & we had a great time for our "last supper" in Vegas.
Delicious food. Service was a little slow. I got the lobster rolls which were not stingy on the lobster. The fries are amazing.
We struck gold again at Todd English! Sat at the bar, were greeted by Ryan the bartender!!! . . However, Eleanor and Garrett were very accommodating and very very nice!  . . We had oysters on the half shell, shrimp and drinks...amazing!! The service was out of this world, and so friendly. The food was amazing but the company with all of the bar staff made it incredible.  Definitely will be coming back when I'm in Vegas!
Peel and Eat Shrimp and their Oysters are AMAZING!!! Haven't had such great luck with service in the dining room but sat at the bar last night and had THE BEST service at the bar with Elanor and Ryan!!! I always bring people here from out of town because the food is so good (along with the seafood the Steak Frites is delicious). Will for sure be back to sit at the bar with our new friends! :)
My husband and I got breakfast here this morning and we were really disappointed. I would expect the egg sandwich here to be amazing but it was anything but. Cold plain bun, barely there avocado, cold scrambled eggs. The bacon was great I'll give them that. It was just blah and fell apart completely. It looks like such a great place maybe it was an off day.
Amazing food and atmosphere. Duck buns and poster rolls...change your life. An overwhelmingly awesome beer selection.
