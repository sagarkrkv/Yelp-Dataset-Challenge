There is nothing more I can say about this show that hasn't already been said.  It was a beautiful, intricate, immersive feast for the eyes.  . . I do have to point out a few things to help you choose from the many different Cirque shows in Las Vegas at any one time.. . 1. You will enjoy this show 10x more if you are Beatles fan.  They excerpt part of the Beatles Sessions/Beatles Anthology with speaking parts from their recording sessions.  They fake you out a few times with that.  If you don't know the music, you will still probably like it, but I think knowing the songs helps you understand the context of some of the aspects of the show.. . 2. This is not a terribly aerial or acrobatic show.  Don't get me wrong, there are acrobatics in the show and some of them are cool to watch, but you will not get the gravity defying acrobatics that you might see in some of the other shows.  This show is all about the music and the songs.  They tell stories and they dance.  And oh do they dance.  If you are a fan of dance, you will love this show.  I would describe it as more acrobatic ballet. . . 3.  There really is not a bad seat in the whole place, but if you sit in one of the lower sections, you will be able to participate in the audience participation part of the show which is hella cool and if you have kids, they will really love it.  The scale of the online seating chart is misleading.  It is a pretty small theatre and you will not miss out on anything or have any obstructions if you sit higher up.  I would recommend section 209 if you can get it.  It is where I sat and I had an excellent perspective. . . 4. The staff was very professional and friendly.  I bought my tickets online and was not given the opportunity to select a seat.  The seat I was assigned was next to a young couple who were obviously trying to impress each other because they smelled like they had very literally taken a bath in cologne and perfume.  It gave me such a headache, I got up and asked the aisle section attendant if I could possibly be reseated, especially since it didn't seem like it was going to be a sold out show.  I explained why I wanted to be reseated and she seemed to understand.  Not only was she able to reassign me a new seat, it was in a better section, closer to the action.  I am extremely grateful, otherwise I'm not sure I could have enjoyed the show.. . 5.  Don't even think about trying to sneak a photo.  They have people monitoring the sections and if you get caught, they will ask you to leave.
This was the first Cirque De Soleil show I have seen and I was annoyed about it. My friend decided to book tickets for the whole group on a Friday without telling us. On learning this, my response was "You did what? Ballet and dancing and s**t on a Friday night in Vegas, are you kidding?".  So after having a mild tantrum I went and begrudgingly had a bloody good time, damn it!. Despite my heritage I am not even much of a Beatles fan, I fell like they did some good song and whole lot of rubbish, but I digress. The show really picked the best songs and the stunts that went with them were just incredible. I still find it hard to believe that people can be that talented. Just brilliant!
Loved it! I'm not a Beatles fan but I am a Cirque de Solei fan! . . *Let me tell you up front, don't worry about what seat you get, any seat is great in the way this circular stage is set up in an intimate setting. . . -These performers are amazing and gave me an understanding for what was going on during this generation of music.. . -I don't want to give anything away, but let me just say, "wow!" This is a show worth seeing!
If you're wondering which show to go to in Vegas, this is the one to watch!!!!!. . I'm not really a Beatles fan and know only some of the songs that are used in the show, but I truly enjoyed it! The lady right next to me said to me after the show, 'It was fabulous!' And the lady on the other died kept singing the songs during the show!. . The first ten minutes made me say 'WOW!' I felt that the first act was worth $125. Oh, and when I got the ticket, I was upgraded! It's because I got it only 40 minutes before the start of the show .. . This was my second Cirque show, having watched Quidam in Montreal, and I'm definitely a big fan of Cirque du Soleil!
I had never seen a Cirque show until I saw "The Beatles LOVE" - but I am a huge Beatles fan and had wanted to see a Cirque show for quite some time. I've had the soundtrack since the show debuted, and just finally was able to go to the show this past weekend.. . The show was amazing and I want to take my entire family. I'm sure plenty of people before me have reviewed the content and the technical aspects, so let me throw around some tips about the actual experience of seeing this show in particular and what stood out to me.. . 1) There really is no bad seat (unless you get one of the cheap-o seats that SAY "restricted viewing" when you book.) The theater is smaller than I had anticipated, and although I was in the highest section, still had a fantastic view.. . 2) The lobby is really fun and unique and there are a lot of cool drinks to buy (just be prepared to spend around $20 on a large drink in a souvenir cup). Having said that - there is NO BATHROOM in the lobby. So if you're like me, and you decide to guzzle down your entire large drink in the show, and then race out when it's over because you need to pee, be prepared to navigate all the way out the lobby, past the gift shop, and around the corner from the box office!. . 3) It's not what I had in my head of a typical Cirque show (although I haven't seen any others.) The acrobatics were fun but mostly not jaw-dropping. There was a lot of dancing and some fun running around. Don't expect to be mesmerized by crazy body-bending and mind blowing feats. That's not what this is about; it's about the music and telling the stories of the Beatles' history and music. That's not a negative thing - it's just a note about the content and style of the show.. . 4) Try to get into the lobby a bit early so you can take pictures with all the fun decor before it gets too crowded. Grab your drink and take a selfie - you sure won't be able to after the performance when it's packed!
I can't believe this show got such high ratings! To be fair, I must preface this review with the fact that I'm not a huge Beatles fan. But I also wasn't a huge Elvis fan, until I watched that cirque du soliel show. . . The seating is circular, so there really isn't a bad seat from what I can tell. I actually enjoyed being mid-way up, so I could get a more aerial view. There were plenty of open seats for the Saturday 9:30 show, so the usher said we could move once the show started. . . The performance was mediocre. There was only one scene that really stood out. Longest 1 1/2 hrs ever!
Unbelievable. Just go. Amazing whether you like Beatles music or not. But if you do you'll be in heaven! Just amazing.
This show was beautiful! My group came here for Homecoming and it was a lot of fun!  Just like any Cirque show, there's not much talking and sometimes I was a little lost, but as always the Beatles music was pristine and the creative ways the performers complimented the music was unforgettable.  Overall, a great show.
Loved the show, loved the Retro Decor, loved the Beatles Store, didn't love the price of the beer or drinks but the rest of it made it all worth it. I hope I can see the show again on my next visit it was the best show I've seen.
I wish I could give this show 10 stars. Saw this for the first time when I was 16 when I didn't even consider myself a Beatles fan other than Yesterday which was the background music of my grandparents 25th wedding anniversary video (nostalgia). . Fast forward 8 years and I have seen Love 5 times, the last time being 3 months ago.. I have always had the discounted seats that are offered in the summer until this last time when I was in the third row. I have to say  that I have NEVER had a bad seat. Each section/seat that I've sat in offered a whole new experience and all 5 times I've seen the show, I have noticed different, new things that I hadn't seen the time/times before. I've seen several Cirque shows and Love is by far the best experience I have had, hence my seeing it 5 times. I honestly found the other a bit boring. It will be a sad, sad day if they ever retire this show.
We've seen it twice, which is really saying something because before our first time I didn't think any show could be worth $100 a seat. That time we sat waayy up in the highest section (303) and the sound was AMAZING. So amazing some say it brought tears to their eyes ( I would never admit to such silliness). I actually think the sound was a little better than in the middle section (209) that we sat in this time but I think section 209 is the hot ticket visually. Call the box office at The Mirage for the best deals, the agent was very helpful. We go to Vegas a once or twice a year and we will probably see this show again.
This is my second time seeing this show. What an absolutely amazing experience. I have not had the pleasure of going to any other Cirque du Soleil shows. That said, Dr. Roberts made our night. We happened to be in the first row and he just made it extra special. The entire cast was amazing and of course you cannot go wrong with the music. . . You are able to grab a drink and snacks for the show. For me personally, I did not participate in this as I was afraid I may have to use the bathroom if I did. There are no intermissions and the show lasts about an hour and a half. . . I will absolutely go back and I am seriously considering seeing another performance done by Cirque du Soleil.
Superb!  A brilliant show in every respect. This show does a great job of combining a fantastic Cirque Do Soliel show with some. Of my favorite music. I could see this show over and over again!.
I've lost count of how many Cirque shows I've seen ... This one had great music, great costumes (as always), and great acrobatics.  My only complaint (and this isn't really much of a complaint) is that there is almost too much going on and I kept feeling like I was missing things.  I'd absolutely recommend the show, especially if you're a Beatles fan
Second time seeing LOVE, if you're even remotely in any way a fan of The Beatles music, GO.. . If you weren't a fan of The Beatles, and want to experience Cirque, go anyway.. . Wife and I had a blast at the event, were very comfortable in the theater, and highly recommend this to any Vegas goers.
I've seen this show and the Michael Jackson Cirque du Soleil, and neither one disappointed!  I would see both of them over and over again.  Now, I will give the edge to this show, because I like The Beatles music much more than MJ's.  The performances are unbelievably spectacular and even if you're not the biggest Beatles fan, you should enjoy the show!  I'm ready to go see it again... and again!
This was my fourth Cirque show. It is unlike the others by far--Zumanity in Vegas, Iris in Hollywood, and Totem in Irvine. Iris and Totem have been my favorites by far. This show is about the music and the dancing. There is very little acrobatics in the extreme form as the other shows I've seen. Also, the storyline is--hmm, this is totally not fair to say--maybe a tad less artistic. I'm not sure if I'm articulating this well, but it was very easy to follow. That's not an insult just an insight. If you don't love the Beatles' music, don't go. I love the Beatles so it was a blast!
Great show!  This definitely exceeded my expectations.  I have not been to any other Cirque du Soleil shows yet, but this was definitely a great start.  It was thoroughly entertaining to watch with fantastic music by The Beatles.  My wife and I will definitely see another Cirque show.
