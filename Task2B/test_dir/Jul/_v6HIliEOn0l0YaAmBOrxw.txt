Friendly desk agent offered champagne for anniversary  despite 3rd party hotwire booking. Very nice. . Room average you get what you pay for but clean. . . Pool party Saturday was great...great!!!!. . So pretentious beach clubs in Vegas charge cover, charge for chairs. Not that fun. Great DJ free.99... My fav price. Yeah $7beers but your in Vegas!!! . . Pool is small which maximizes crazy per square foot... It was an absolute blast!!!. . Also good location.
Class class classic. Awesome hotel. . My opinion best for your buck. Every time I visit TI I am treated like a VIP. The drinks in the casino could be a bit stronger, but hey....I ain't complaining....they're free (plus a tip to the nice person serving them). The place is clean, and every one always seems like they're having fun. The night life in the casino is always festive, and the rooms are amazing. Clean, good size, and great views. TI is home away from home for me. I always look forward to coming to Vegas when I am staying at treasure island.
It was a decent room but it was quite dusty. The side table next to the bed was very dusty. Also, the bath tub faucet was about to fall out of the wall.  Other than that, the stay was nice.
Very friendly staff at every turn. Beds are comfy and bathroom is nice. Room was clean and ready when we arrived. AC was a little warm, one call to front desk and filter changed in no time. We reserved and received a room with a strip view, all I can say is wow. 26th floor. Received bogo for the cirque show and was able to buy two get two even with on room. Great customer service.
I gave this place a three star because the check in was pretty fast and it was a good price and good location, the bus stop is very close, the bed and pillow were comfortable. Other than that, there is nothing good. . . - The room was not clean, there was a piece of toilet paper on the bathroom floor and one lip-stick near the bed. (WOO-HOOO, I got a free lip-stick). - There is no trash can in the bathroom. . - Our "do not disturb" sign got stolen. . - The fridge stayed warm all the time, might as well call it a toaster. . - The buffet was ok, nothing exciting. . - The ventilation was really bad. I booked a non-smoking room but the smoke smell just came right from the a/c. They had vanilla smell all over the hotel, the mixed vanilla smell and smoke was just a worst combination for me. Not to mention carpet smell, ahhhh. I do expect that smoke smell when it comes to Las Vegas but it was too much in this hotel.. - The fitness was ok, it was small but it served the purpose.. - The TV is really small and had a really bad resolution, my computer at home is bigger than their TV, can't watch anything from the bed.. . Overall, if you're a person who don't care about the smell and cleanliness that much, this place would be a good place to stay.
Very big rooms, right on the strip (beside the Venetian and mirage. Excellent location. The buffet is spectacular, you normally get free vouchers along with many more and $20 off your next stay. The poker room is pathetic but everything else is decent. Parking is great. The pool is good enough, has a party atmosphere toit but welcoming to families. I have been to Vegas 5 times now and I will stay at TI from now on because it is by far the best bang for your buck.
Stayed here for 4th of July weekend and it was nicer than I expected. I had no issues with the cleanliness of the room as we reserved a nicer room with a strip view. We loved our room. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. Our refrigerator wasn't cool enough, but we called the front desk and they checked it out and it started to cool much better. Only problem I had was the guy helping us with our bags as we were leaving was a bit rude, but you'll have that sometimes. I miss the pirates! I can't believe they're changing it. Change is good, but I like the pirates. Overall I had a good stay and wouldn't mind staying here again.
we stayed here for 2 days. 5 stars for peaceful place. 5 star for staff friendliness. 5 star for the location (close to almost every place you want to go in the strip). 5 star for NO incidentals deposits on standard rooms.  5 star for almost everything.. I love our stay in treasure island.
Great hotel stayed 2 nights wonderful time very happy with the casino and hotel. Got a great price on are stay and free buffet coupons.
This place sucks I paid for 160 to equal 200 for most of there resturants and I called down the day I checked out to make sure I wasn't over and they told me I had 17.82 left and then when I checked out they then told me I had a balance of 236.00 that I owed them don't stay hear they are liers and thieves
I have traveled extensively for work primarily in the United States but also abroad.  And I've stayed in every type of hotel from the Ritz Carlton to Motel 6. From all of my experiences, I have found that hands-down, Treasure Island has had the absolute worst customer service I've ever encountered.  I felt like the employees felt that I should be honored to stay there.  They were not receptive at all and asking for anything was very uncomfortable.  I have many examples of their rude behavior but I will only share a couple examples.  The first example was at check-in; when we came in, it was 2:30am and we were really tired because our flight was delayed but I felt that we were still in a good mood since we just arrived in Las Vegas.  When we talked to the girl at the desk, she indicated that we would not get what we reserved. We reserved 2 beds in a non-smoking room.  Her reason was that we booked through a third party and therefore don't have the right to reserve a room.  I didn't know that booking through a third party would make my money any less valuable  When the person I travelled with said that we should be upgraded, she said that it would be impossible because once again, we booked through a third party.  Enraged by this information, I asked to speak to the manager, whom she called and poof!  We had the room that we reserved after all.  Of course, the girl made it seem like she did us a really big favor.  Later on, I read online that at this particular hotel they do this, so they could obtain tips.  I'm sorry but I will not be forced into tipping somebody for something that was expected of them anyhow.  Now if they went above and beyond, I could understand that and would tip generously.  Another example was when I needed a sweatshirt laundered.  I filled out the sheet in my room which indicated that the cost would be $5.50 to launder a pullover, put the sweatshirt in the bag, and called down for them to pick up this bag.  They would not come up and pick it up and forced us to go down and wait in a line for 10 minutes to provide them the bag.  (BTW, we waited in line 10 minutes and when it was our turn, the girl at the desk turned to another customer who just walked up to the desk and helped her, who didn't wait in line and just walked up, rather than help us who were waiting for a long period of time.)  Then when the sweatshirt was ready, they told me it was going to be $8 and they didn't want to bring it up to the room.  At this point, I was insistent that I should only pay what the sheet indicated, the $5.50, and that somebody drop the bag off to the room.  I was on vacation and didn't want to keep running up and down for errands...that's why I was at a hotel.  Furthermore, I had to argue with about 3 people to get the rate of $5.50.  They finally called me back about a half hour later and indicated that $5.50 was fine and that somebody would come up with the sweatshirt shortly, although that took another half hour.  Furthermore, the hotel wouldn't charge anything to my room, although they had my credit card on file.  They wanted a large daily deposit before doing this, which I've read online that wasn't returned in a timely fashion and many times, customers had to argue to get that paid back to them.  I did not want to deal with Treasure Island ever again, after this experience so why in the world would I allow them to hold a hefty deposit on my credit card.  I've never been so unpleasantly surprised and dismayed at their lack of complete customer satisfaction.  In addition to their lack of customer service, the rooms did not have refridgerators, coffee makers (of course coffee there was so expensive so why make something like that convenient), the decor was ancient, the smell throughout the hotel was disgusting (the smoke from cigarettes and cigars wouldn't have been so bad, but that scent that they have piped into the casino smells like a sweaty stripper), the hotel nickel and dimed you for everything (ie. room service was expensive but when ordering it, you'd be charged an extra charge just to order it, etc.), the pool and surrounding  area were closed down due to  renovations (it was January and I probably wouldn't swim but it would've been nice to read a book by the pool since I live in a colder climate),  and many more things.  I would never recommend this hotel ever.  I've stayed in some shacks in Europe in  my past and would prefer those to this experience any day, mostly because of their attitudes towards customers.
Wifi should be included, but otherwise we have had great service and our room is clean and comfortable!
This is definitely our "go to" hotel on the strip. Good location, reasonable prices and great entertainment options! The rooms are spacious and clean. Customer service across the property is always friendly and helpful.. Overall, we will definitely continue coming back!
My very first time staying here. We booked a room with 2 queen beds for a bachelorette party. We were on the 18th floor with a view of the mall & freeway. . . Beds were comfy and room was clean. The restaurants in the hotel were EXPENSIVE!! I can't believe my friend paid $6 for a small glass of Apple juice. . . Room service was great. Hotel was pretty quite we never once heard our neighbors. I would stay here again especially since it was only $350ish for Friday-Tuesday.
My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon. The room was beautiful and the casino was awesome. The buffet was good but not the best I have ever had. It was great having a starbucks right out front the hotel. The only downside was we told them we were here on our honeymoon and it almost seemed like they could careless. After I said do we get a bottle of champagne or something she said sure. The bottle never came so I called down to the front desk. When they finally brought the bottle it was the smallest cheapest bottle of champagne someone could buy. I thought WOW we just spent all this money to stay here and this is what we get. I mean come one. This place makes SOOOOOOO much money you think they could treat there guest a little better than that. Just sayin!. . Most likely if we ever came back to Vegas we would find a better place to stay.
Not a super high luxury hotel, but very affordable and clean rooms! . I like the location- near Fashion Mall, Bellagio, Wynn. . Room service does not provide complimentary slippers anymore =(
One of the best values on the strip.  Restaurants and Casino r a bust, but the pool is great and the rooms r clean, modern, and most have a decent view.
I wish that I could rate this place zero stars or negative stars.  . . Here are just a few things that I did not like: . . 1) Room's cleanliness: Room was very dirty. I found a Revlon makeup container in the bedroom floor. So, it was evident that the housekeepers didn't vacuum. I am a male and I don't use makeup. My wife doesn't use Revlon, so I know it wasn't something that fell out of my suitcase. . . The bathroom was, in their own manager's words, "disgusting."  I found lots of hair on the bathroom floor (obviously, no one even attempted to clean this). I also found pubic hairs on the tub and sink.  Let's just sat that I shave and there is no chance that the body hair of any kind was mine.  Several "clean" towels had hairs on them, and the hairs were from different people (hairs were red, blond, black, brown, etc.). . . Until this trip, I had never complained at a hotel ever in my entire life. I used to clean bathrooms and gyms as a college student, so I know how tough it is to get the job done in the time allotted. Also, I am a very forgiving person. I don't expect my room to be as clean as an operating room. On Saturday morning, I went to the manager and complained. He listened to me, and expressed his apologies. He also said that the hair in the floor was "disgusting" and "unacceptable." He offered me a free buffet ticket.  That's it.  A free buffet ticket...wait for it...for two people.  He basically accused me of lying. . . I got the sense that the manager thought I had invited some women into my room because he asked me several times if I was alone (and, I was). I suppose the issue was that I didn't complain shortly after checking in. Well, I basically fell asleep as soon as I got to my room on Friday night and I didn't wake up until Saturday morning. I complained as soon as I noticed the hair. . . Lesson learned: check your room ASAP after entering and report any dissatisfactory conditions immediately. . . The housekeeping manager came to my room later on Saturday and checked on my room. That was a nice gesture and made me feel like they actually cared a little. . . 2) Check-in Process: I arrived around 4:00 PM on a Friday. The line to check in was very long, and it took about 30 minutes to get to the desk to check in. . . 3) Ambiance: There were a lot of people in the hotel promoting various dinner specials, show specials, etc. I don't want to deal with that inside my hotel. The Strip is one thing, but come on: I don't want chaos inside my hotel. I go inside to get some peace. The hotel's crowd included a lot of country-Western "macho" guys, which I can't tolerate being around. I also prefer to be around a little bit higher class of person than was at Treasure Island. I don't like being threatened at a bar for accidentally bumping into someone who was blocking the only walking path in Gilley's bar. . . 4) Wi-fi internet not free: It's a little ridiculous that hotels charge for wi-fi. At least it was fast wi-fi.
There are a plethora of hotes to choose from on the strip; we decided on TI because this was our first trip to Vegas and we wanted to have enough spending money. We weren't caught in experiencing the luxury of Bellagio, MGM Grand, etc. I admit the outside isn't much to look at, especially the buidling itself, but that's not why you're in Vegas, right? The interior is much like any other decent hotel/casino. I will say that we were pleasantly surprised by the comfort of the room and thoroughness of the cleaning staff. . . Aside from the 30-45 minute wait to get checked in and the hard water, everything else was fine. Beds were extremely comfortable, internet speeds were decent enough, and all electronics in the room actually worked.. . The Siren show is a must-see, not because it's spectacular, but because you've already paid for it in your reservation, so why not? Entertaining. A bit cheesy. But mildly enjoyable. . . If you're visiting Vegas for the first time or want a decent place to stay without breaking the bank, I'd choose TI.
Very nice hotel.. . - The check in was fast and easy.. - We got a strip view room, and it was pretty awesome. Bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean, we had a great stay.. - The casino was pretty cool, the staff very helpful, and the buffett was delicious.. . I'd definitely go back to T.I.
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #4:. well, it's mediocre, as you would expect; still carries traces of its Disney-type heyday, particularly the Strip-front pirate ships (which are actually kind of cool), so there's a fairly high family/rugrat factor here; but most of the restaurants/bars are more adult-oriented, albeit tacky & touristy (Gilley's, Senor Frog's, Kahunaville); it's overall a pretty nice place and low on the smoke smell; seems smaller than most of the Strip casinos, so you run out of places to explore fairly quickly here; best craft beer bet = believe it or not, Gilley's has a few decent selections, including some Alaskan Brewing Co. beers on tap, and Abita beers in a bottle.
I just had my wedding and afterparty at the hotel and other than a hiccup at check-in had a perfect time! . . Our tower suite was clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. Plenty of closet space and two gorgeous bathrooms, with lots of seating area for groups to hang out and relax. . . The Chapel at TI did an amazing job and we felt like the only wedding of the day (they had eight). Dinner in the private room at Phil's Steakhouse was amazing and my guests spent the rest of the weekend going on about how great the food and drinks were. Mystere was pretty and family friendly but also a bit incomprehensible...no plot, more like a weird and well costumed circus. . . Daytime room service people were amazingly friendly and helpful. Nighttime room service was not as good and the server insisted on leaving my room with my credit card in his hand!!! Two days later I got a spoof email from "my bank." . . Buffet on Friday and Saturday nights is perfect for anyone who wants to power-eat crab legs (like me); breakfast buffet had great eggs benedict. If not for the questionable room service at night I would have given this hotel a perfect score. Phil's Steakhouse (and their manager John, who bent over backward to make my wedding dinnerperfect) and the Chapel at TI both deserve top marks for quality, service and friendliness. I am so pleased I decided to have my wedding there...and so were my guests! . . Caveat: the old pirate show, Sirens, is permanently closed.
Stayed here last year and enjoyed the stay, booked this again through Hotels.com there rates beat going direct to the hotel. In my room by 2.00pm no waiting line at reception, straight in.Great staff and helpful. Easy self undercover parking.
Great Location!. . - The room was nice, we were on the 33rd floor.  The view was wonderful, it was facing the strip.  . - 5 minute walk to Fashion show mall.  And 7 minute walk to Wynn and Encore.  . - There are restaurants inside the hotel, and star bucks too!  . . Definitely a great place to stay, I think its much cheaper than many hotels in the strip.
Pros: I love this hotel it is great we got it with 2 for one buffet and 2 for 1 show the show in treasure island was great we also saw the dream off course the dream was much better the room was clean and it was great .. . Cons: nothing
