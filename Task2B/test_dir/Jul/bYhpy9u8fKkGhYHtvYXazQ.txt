Great casino and cocktail waitresses! Right when we sat down to play a few slot machines, we had a cocktail waitress approach us. Definitely a great place to be! Props to the bartender because he made my AMF DELICIOUS! I will definitely come back here to gamble again on my next trip!
Horrible bar service! Went last night for the first time, and the dude working the bar had a thick accent and was hard to understand, took forever to get service in the first place, and then he took forever making them, and let me tell you, they were the worst Long Island ice teas I've ever had, then he had the audacity to charge 31.50 for 2 Long Island ice teas. At first I thought he said 21.50, which is still ridiculous, but since he had a thick accent, he had to repeat it like 3 times! Their slots suck and the experience sucked! Never going back there, and unless you wanna get gauged of your money for drinks I suggest you don't go there either. . . Upside the decor was pretty cool and there were girls wearing lingerie dancing on tables and the girls who were working the card tables were dressed like that too, which was cute and sexy!
My first trip to Vegas, All I was looking at a budget friendly and affordable hotel yet highly reviewed and iconic.. Oh yeah, this is the one..  I got a good summer deal for 3 nights, rooms are comfy, clean, and acceptable.. I got great glimpse of the Strip and I have enjoyed it yet I have hardly spent my time in the hotel room (All time partying ;)).. What else?? If you are looking for a good hotel yet affordable, this is for sure the one....
Paris hotel was so so. Room was average decor but appeared run down and dated. Stain on ottoman, missing knob from entertainment center, scratched up baseboards, and door to room was all scuffed making it appear dirty. However room size was larger than normal and the bathroom was nice with a walk in shower. . . Previous reviews indicated rude staff. Those reviews were right on. Check in started nice however when I asked to upgrade to a Petite Suite with view she rudely said nobody gets a petite suite with a view over a weekend. She made me feel embarrassed for asking.  . . Day of leave we went to have our bags stored. Bell hop was dealing with a customer before us. His demeanor with those customer was rude. They were looking for their bags and needless to say he told them to go back to their rooms to find them.  They had a hard time with English and he wasn't about to slow down and try to help explain things.  When it was our turn he wanted to know why we were storing them and then went into interrogation mode wanting to know rudely what we were going to do while our bags where there.  His way of asking really put us on the defensive. We seemed to be an inconvenience for him and he didn't attempt to hide it.  . . Overall disappointing experience for a hotel that appears so nice on the outside.
I've never stayed at Paris Las Vegas but I have spent a fair amount of time gaming in there. I love the blue sky and clouds mural on the ceilings and the light effects they do to mimic day light. The casino floor is nice, but I think Paris thinks a bit too highly of themselves because their table minimums were awfully high, and their poker tourneys were set at buy-ins that were so high that they were only filling half of the field.. . However, Paris does have one little thing that sets it apart from every other place on the Strip: their breakfast buffet. This breakfast spread they have, set in a Parisian village theme, is absolutely out of control. I have never in my life seen so many different options on a breakfast buffet. At $30/person, it's steep, but it is an experience you'll never forget. In the "you're not going to believe this just happened to me" Vegas-story fashion, my buddy and I are standing in this incredibly long line waiting to pay our $30 each and these two incredibly cute girls walk out of the buffet area and headed over to us. They asked us if we'd like two free coupons for the buffet; of course we took them graciously and chatted for just a minute. They had to go to the airport and weren't going to be in town to use them. They informed us we didn't have to wait in line, we could just walk in -- and walk in we did. Certain things in life are just perpetual game-changers, and Paris' breakfast buffet is one of them.. . Everything you ever wanted or could dream of wanting for breakfast was there. Since that experience, it's been a tradition that every time I'm in town, I go to Paris for breakfast only. They can keep the gaming and sell that to the tourists. If I want to game, I'll go to the MGM, Rio, Caesars or the Bellagio. In fact, Paris could just close its casino as far as I'm concerned and keep the breakfast buffet open. This is also where my nickname "Bullmoose" originated, so it's been a great story to tell!
I go to Vegas every year for my anniversary and have tried most of the casinos on the strip. I wanted to like it, I love the theme resorts. But service was pretty rude from beginning to end. . . We paid for a red room luxury booking, when we checked in they didn't have any available.  When we asked why it wasn't reserved, the concierge rolled her eyes and lectured us on how she's doing her best to accommodate us. Um, that doesn't explain the lack of reservation at all, but great deflection and attempt to make us out to be the problem. At the very least I would expect an apology for not having it, instead of acting like we're unreasonable for expecting our reservation to be reserved. They offered us a downgraded room. When I objected, she said she did have a red room luxury available, but only a smoking room and we booked a non-smoking. I didn't want to get less than what we booked and paid for so I took the smoking room. Her explanation, after trying to get us to take a lower room, was that the smoking vs. non aspect of the reservation isn't guaranteed, only the room type. She didn't even offer us our room type though until I said no to the downgrade and asked for something else.. . She also said the room was ready according to the maid service, but when we went up to our room the cleaning staff were still working on it. We had to hang out awkwardly while they were still mopping the bathroom. There were no snacks or drinks stocked though the fridge was wired up for that, and no robes. I wonder if maybe these things were missing because the maid felt hussled out of there by our presence or if these things just aren't included anymore. These are standard niceties that I've had at all my other casino stays even in the lowest room types, so it just felt shabby booking a more expensive nicer-level room and not having any of these things. I think in the future I would recommend only booking the cheapest room type so that they can't possibly downgrade you if they don't have your reservation available.
We stayed two days there.. They lied to us, well lets say that they didnt gave us all the info at the front desk. They never told us about the "resort fee" that was 24$ per night including wifi for one device. I asked them to remove it from my bill since they never told my about it and i either used the wifi. They didnt want to hear me.. Also i felt like u have 0 benefits from staying there, like the buffet or taking the eiffel tower elevator should be cheaper for those who stayed at the hotel, but no.. There was a problem in the toilet, leaking water and after i called they never showed up so we put a tower on the floor.. For me? A lesson learned
Last week we stayed 4 days at the Paris Hotel. The first day of checking in was kinda crazy. First off, my parents were in line for about an hour waiting in the long line to check in. The check in room is nice, however they did not seemed to be very staffed (and this was the week of 4th of July). When we were finally helped, we got to our room that specifically asked for to be non-smoking, smelling heavily of smoke. We called the front desk and they said to come downstairs straight to the Platinum Member line so that they could switch rooms. When my mom and dad went downstairs, they came back up with keys to another room but also said that the lady helping the Platinum member line (her name was Kita) was very rude to them and acted like she didn't want to speak with them and that my parents had no business being in the Platinum Member line. So we get to the second room and it smelled better but now there was only one king bed (not 2 queens which we had also specifically asked for). So now my mom is very agitated and this time went back downstairs to the platinum line with my grandma to explain that the room we had switched to still didn't accommodate us. When my mom finally came back up again with another room key, she said that she had to deal with Kita again and that when my mom tried to explain to her that the room didn't have two queens, Kita just rolled her eyes and walked away! My mom and grandma were confused and asked the neighboring employee helping another line where Kita went and he didn't understand why she stormed off and helped my mom and grandma himself. Kita has TERRIBLE customer service obviously! My mom ended up paying $40 extra dollars a night on top of what we were already paying also just to get a better view from our window. Once we got to the third room of the day, it didn't smell like smoke, had two queens, and a very nice view of the Paris pool, some of the strip, and the Bellagio water show. The bathroom sink was clogged though so we had to call someone for that. The rooms are average, out of 10 I would probably give it 6 or 7 stars. It's a nice room, but nothing to wow about. . . That night we ate dinner at the buffet at Le Village. Waited in line almost an hour again for food that wasn't that great. They have a lot of different choices of food to eat, but none of it looked fresh or appetizing. My family only found a few things we actually liked. . . We had dinner another night at Le Cafe which was a little better but overlypriced! . . The pool was very nice; got some good pictures next to the replica of the Eiffel Tower.. . It was an average stay, but will probably be the last time we stay at Paris unless we get some kind of special offers down the road.
Checking in to this hotel was a nightmare!!   We had our wedding, reception, and guests at Paris, and we felt like they didn't care about service at all.  We paid extra for a view of the Eiffel Tower, then paid an additional fee for a room upgrade, and the woman at the desk neglected to tell us it looked over the parking lot.  She said it was our fault because we were having a conversation during the check in process, and she was unwilling to fix it, so we called the supervisor.  I hated starting my wedding trip with complaints, but we paid a lot of money for a great experience.  The supervisor Jaylee was awesome!!  Jaylee put us in a beautiful room, overlooking the Eiffel Tower and Bellagio water show.  After that the stay was pretty decent.  . . Suggestion - if the view matters to you, confirm it at check in, and if you can get the Calais suite, it is worth the extra money.
This hotel is just so cool. We didn't stay there, but we ate there and it was quite the experience.. . The blue clouded sky above you is amazing, along with all the other decor that makes it seem like you're walking the streets of Paris.. . We did go to a buffet inside that was pretty legit, for Vegas fare ;). . I seriously wish it didn't smell so badly of smoke though. Sigh.
My review is on the casino as I did not stay at the hotel, I stayed at bally's. The casino itself is beautiful in my opinion and a great site to checkout on the inside and out. I recommend getting a picture of the Eiffel Tower at night. The restaurants inside are very nice and the food is good, however, some are very overpriced; especially the 'le burger' located near Bally's. You'll pay $15 for a burger alone and about $9 for a draught beer. I would avoid that place unless you truly want to pay a lot for burgers. They do have a good place to get bagels and other breakfast quick eats near their pizza place. The casino floor is very clean and waitresses seemed quick. They also have some neat gift shops. Unless you get a view overlooking the tower and bellagio I would recommend staying at Ballys based off the Paris room reviews to save some money.
This was my first Vegas hotel stay with friends and I thought Paris was a good first experience.. . Unfortunately for us, we arrived late due to a delayed flight. Checking in took quite a while and we ended up having to stay in a smoking room the first night since they ran out of non-smoking rooms. However, the staff offered to send someone up to spray some air freshener around our room, which was quite entertaining. The air freshener didn't do a great job in covering up the smell however. . . When we got back to our hotel later at night, we asked the front desk to send up some "o-zone" machine that they had offered. Though the machine was loud, it definitely helped us breath a little better that night. Unfortunately, our clothes still had a lingering smell thanks to the cigarette smoke from the past hotel guests.. . Then, around 7AM the next day, our sleep was disturbed as a hotel staff member knocked on our door then called us to get the machine back. No bueno!. . We ended up getting a room change around 10AM, which was also offered at check-in. We got a room on the 10th floor with a beautiful view of the Eiffel tower and our stay became much more pleasant since it was a non-smoking floor.. . Location was fantastic since we were at the center of the strip. Catching a taxi to go down the strip in either direction only cost about $10-$15 each way.. . The pool was a great relaxing experience. After you flash your room key to the staff at the pool entrance, they give you a towel so you don't need to worry about bringing your own. There was music playing while we lazied around. We were at the pool at around 4PM and most of the pool was covered in shade from the Eiffel tower, so the water was slightly cold. Otherwise, great spot to lounge around!. . On day of check out, we utilized their luggage assistance while we had to check-out early in the morning but weren't leaving until later in the night. Everything went well.. . Nothing too out of the ordinary or spectacular at this hotel, but I felt like we were well accommodated. I wouldn't mind staying here again.
Beware of Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino...and any other hotel/resort Harrah's owns.  Stayed at the Paris for a work conference in April.  Went out to dinner within their sprawling resort and came back to find my laptop, Kindle Fire and silver necklace had been stolen.  Their on-site security found the door lock to be faulty AND didn't take DNA evidence from a cup the burglars left on my bathroom sink, even after I asked if they wanted/needed it.  When I made my police report, the LVMPD let me know these kinds of thieves are called "door pushers" and it's a common occurrence in Vegas.  And no, the Paris does not have cameras in the hallways nor the stair wells (my briefcase was found cleaned out in one of their stair wells).  Conveniently enough for Harrah's, the state of NV law states innkeepers are only liable for up to a maximum of $750 per incident of theft on their property.  It's cheaper for Paris/Harrah's to write a check for $750 (which didn't even cover the cost of a new laptop) than prevent "door pushers" from stealing your belongings.. Word to the wise:  Always, always, always push your door upon leaving your room...especially in Vegas!
So I was really excited to be staying at this hotel because I haven't stayed here in sooooo long. . When arriving the bell guys were really nice and took our stuff with no problem.. Check in: We got up to the counter and the guy that was checking us in was a true PAIN IN THE ASS! Sorry this was horrible he snapped at us the entire time. He didn't explain anything to us and was trying to charge us extra for everything. We finally had to ask for the manager and by the time she arrived he was already finished and the manager didn't do anything other then let us check in 30 min before 3PM. LOL . Room: RUNNNNNN DOWN they were not good at all it was extremely out dated and not very clean. When you go to Vegas you expect  these nice rooms but what a huge let down. . Pool: LOL compared to the other pools on the strip this was nothing to see or even be at. It is this round pool that everyone just hangs at. BORING . Checking bags on the way out: So my sister was waiting in the line and gave the guy one bag and I walked up with my second bag and the guy said he didn't have room for my luggage. So I had to wait in line AGAIN to check in the bags. BEYOND RUDE AND EMBARRASSING.. Checking out: OMG THE rudeness continues we apparently were being charged extra things like early check in and etc. because the guy checking us in was just an ASSHOLE. So we had to ask for a manager AGAIN. . Overall this was a disaster! I would never stay there again. Employees RUDE, Rooms extremely run down and pool is laughable. Sorry Paris change your employees and update rooms. VERY DISAPPOINTING
This review is solely based on our experience at the casino. We did not have the opportunity to stay here. There's lots of things to do in this resort. Lots of good food! This place has a night ambiance and makes you lol feel like you're taking a stroll in a park. My only complaint is that drink service is pretty sparse here and we never got a drink order the entire time we were playing.
My friends and I didn't really know what to expect since it was all of our first times in Las Vegas as adults! We booked a room at Paris through Expedia, as per another friend's suggestion. I suggest reserving through Expedia or other websites to save money! The location is ideal since it is right at the center of The Strip. A cab ride to/from the airport is no more than $20, and a trip to the north or south of The Strip is about $10-$15.. . Check-in time is 4pm and check-out is at 11am. They don't charge for late check-ins thankfully. Also, they can hold your luggage for as long as you need them to, after you check-out. We were supposed to get in at around 10pm, but didn't arrive until nearly 12am due to a delayed flight. The line was still long to check-in, as there were only two people working at the counters. We got our two queen beds as requested, but were placed in a smoking room since we had arrived so late and the rooms were already filled. However, the staff did put a note for us to switch to a non-smoking floor the second night if the room reeked too much of smoke. . . The smell was much too overwhelming when we walked in. Thankfully, when checking in, they told us we could request for someone to spray air freshener, and some o-zone machine could be brought up as well. The air freshener made the room smell fresh for maybe half an hour. The o-zone machine helped us get through the night, though it was really loud.. . We were rudely awaken at 7 the next morning by the staff asking for the machine back. When we ignored the knock, they called instead! The night before, they told us we had until 6pm the next day if we would like a room change. When I called downstairs around 10am, they had a room on the 10th floor ready for us. The view was nice and the room smelled fresh. Woohoo!. . The pool is gorgeous! You get a great view of the hotel's architecture as well as the Eiffel Tower. Towels are also provided. You'll need to flash your room key for entrance and for the towels.. . Aside from that slight hiccup of being woken that first morning, our experience was quite pleasant! The concierges were also very helpful when we asked them for help. I would recommend staying here! Prices and rooms are decent enough, especially if you just need a place to crash!
This hotel had it's ups and downs. Checked in late on Friday night and the non-smoking room we requested was given away so we had to settle with a smoking room. They told us to come to the front desk between 12-3pm the following day to change rooms since they gave our room away so we agreed. . . Next day rolls around and after a great time at the pool and gym we called and they kept pushing back the time on when the room would be ready. We wasted 5 hours of our day not being able to leave and waiting for our non smoking room to be available. For someone who comes for the weekend and hours are limited it really sucks to waste time. Finally they gave us a non smoking room after complaining for 5 hours and sounding upset. It was a big disappointment. I'm giving three stars because that was an awful experience but the hotel itself wasn't too bad. The room we got upgraded and it was really nice. . . On a positive light the hotel is in the middle of the strip and it's across the street from Cosmo and Bellagio. Had fun shopping and eating at Gordon Ramsey's Burgr place.
Gross! Gross! Gross!. . Hair in the shower and bathtub, red stains in the carpet, and bad bad water pressure. I felt like I was camping. If it weren't for the hotels great casino vibe, restaurants, and gaming I would've given it one star.
The "manager" was rude as eff, started raising her voice and cutting us off even before we got to explain anything on the phone .. Didnt even let us finish asking the question.. She then proclaimed that she had spent 10 mins on the phone "helping" us.. which was actually more like repeating herself 2983874 times with unhelpful info when all we wanted to know was whether there was a deposit in the credit card statement. Sorry that she was too good and important to assist guests staying at paris. Terrible...  . . Plus the hotel's old and windows are dirty... But seriously the customer service was horrendous and thanks to Tamara, the "manager" who didnt even wanna let us speak to anyone else, i will never visit this hotel ever again. Dont waste your money guys, go to Aria.
Other than the location and the pool under the Eiffel Tower...  There is nothing special about this hotel.  As a matter of fact, it sucked.  Our room sucked.  Our view sucked.  The restaurants below sucked.  I spent so much money and ended up in a smoking room, with a view of a smoke deck.  I was mad.  But, hey!  I didn't go to Vegas for the room, so I got over it and hit the strip!
I just spent the weekend at Paris Las Vegas Hotel and will never stay there again. I have stayed at many other hotels on the strip, so this is what I am comparing it to. First, the check-in line was huge, and this was a slow weekend according to the taxis drivers. So they assigned us a standard room, which is what we paid for, but forgot to give us the normal package of coupons. The room looked old and looked like it needed an upgrade badly. The carpet was disgusting. The bathroom was nice though. The tv was all the way on the left on the wall, so the view from the bed farthest away was terrible. The remote had no channel guide so you had to try every channel to find what you want. They told me that wi if was free and gave me instructions that were totally unclear. I called down stairs and they really didn't know the proper procedure. I finally figured it out, but could only get wi if for the first night. I went down to the gym, but it was closed to repair the air conditioner. I went there the next day. The gym is small and very poorly designed with the treadmills all facing inwards a few feet away from the other people working out. At night time I was kept awake from the people talking next door, as the walls are paper thin. The pool is adequate, but on the smallish size. Maid service was good. The biggest problem was thebill I received via email that was not what I was quoted, and they actually had the gall to charge me for wi fi. So now I have to call and try to get this issue resolved. Wish me luck.
Not sure about the hotel but the pool was just what we were looking for. We stayed off the strip and used a Groupon to use Paris' pool while in the area. Yummy cocktails and nice scenery. Staff was very friendly! Pool was clean and fun but still quiet enough for relaxing. Very happy with our decision to spend the day here!
My wife and I stopped by Paris casino on our last trip to Vegas to watch Jersey Boys. The casino is pretty nice here. I think the ceiling is painted with clouds so it looks like it's day inside. I've never stayed at the hotel here but I've been through this casino a few times. The last time I came here, my wife and I ate at Gordon Ramsay Steak here at Paris. The casino itself isn't that bad. It has a good layout of slots and table games. We stayed here after the show and played a little bit. The waitresses were really nice and we had good service. They were always checking up on us to see if we needed any drinks.. . You can also take a ride up on their eiffel tower, but I've never done that before but it probably is nice at night to see all the Vegas lights on the strip.
We were very unimpressed with our stay at Paris. We stayed only one night with the kids on our way to Ca. The valet guy was rude-expected a tip no matter what the service! The air condition went out in the casino area- and when I called front desk he just says it happens there in summer. The crepes were way overpriced...three crepes, 2 slices of pizza, 2 beers, 2 sodas $65! The room was cramped, armoire broken, TV not viewable from both beds, and the shampoo sucked. Only one pool, 3 ft in all areas- just for toddlers. My hubby & I recently stayed two nights at Venetian- so much better. I plan to write management a letter but realize gone are the days when great food, drinks and service were a Vegas given - plan to be stripped of your last dollar before you even get to the tables!
Nice comfortable hotel, connected to Bally's.  Has the famous "le Village" buffet here.
Great strip value!  And the Eiffel Tower is fun, although touristy.  Definitely worth the trip up.. . The little village shop area is romantic and cute.. . Rooms clean/ modern.. . Pool is very small.. . Casino is very good.  Good crowd.  Good layout.
Perfect room for a great price. Great staff checked us in. A little too personal after checking in though ;)
Disclaimer: This review is only for the suite experience at Paris.. . I was fortunately enough to stay in one of their lovely suites here at the Paris recently.  In terms of the overall experience, it was fantastic from beginning to end.  The room was very large for a suite - with a large living room/dining area, small bar area with a sink, two bathrooms (one for the shower and sink, another for the hot tub and dual sinks and bidet), and a huge bedroom with a kind sized bed.  The view was also lovely - it was directly facing the faux-Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio fountains.  We were able to get a terrific view of the water show which was a real treat at night.. . In terms of the room comfort - the bed was absolutely the best part of the experience.  The sheets were soft, the mattress was perfectly comfy (yet firm), and the pillows were just right.  I slept so incredibly well on this trip, which really helped me get some much needed rest before all the nighttime drinking festivities.  . . The shower was good and the hot tub worked fine.  The living area was well appointed with faux-period furniture.  The room was nice and cool and we were very glad the air conditioning worked well (with minimal noise) in the middle of the Vegas summer.  I can't stress how important it is to keep the room cool when it was 110 degrees outside.. . Speaking of heat - it was a perfect time to take a dip in the pool.  The area was quiet, which was excellent compared to some of the noisier pools in other hotels.  It was also huge, but not too deep - which is good for families.  Given the angle of the hotel, it was difficult to find any shade after 12pm noon in the summer, so it got extremely hot by midday, but if you go early in the morning (like we did) you can easily score a good spot by the pool with minimal risk of overexposure to the sun.. . The casino itself is fine - though the minimums here are higher than many of the other Harrah's/Caesars themed hotels in the area.  If you're looking to gamble, expect to spend the same as what you would with Caesars versus other related properties like Harrah's, Flamingo and the Quad (soon to be renamed the LINQ).. . As for food - MonAmiGabi is a nice choice if you're looking to score a decent meal with great outdoor seating facing the Bellagio fountains.  The food there was good, and I enjoyed dining there for breakfast.  The other restaurants and cafes were generally very crowded, aside from the new Gordon Ramsay steakhouse.  In terms of the buffet - Le Village Buffet is a decent choice and one of the better ones among mid-tier buffets in the area.  Obviously you won't get something as good as the Bucchanal buffet at Caesars, The Buffet at Wynn or Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan - but for what you pay for it's an ok choice for any meal of the day.. . I've stayed at the suites at the Wynn and Caesars as well - and I didn't find the experience at Paris to be inferior to the hotels listed above.  Our room was always tended to quickly and the complimentary truffles and wine (of decent quality, I might add) was a nice bonus.  . . If you're looking to go all out - this isn't a bad choice to consider.
Loved our room! Loved the service! If you are looking for a decent crowd of people, stay at the Paris. The men and women were generally dressed well. You have a different type of people that stay here that take care of themselves more and are in Vegas to enjoy good food and good experiences. We've stayed at some other hotels to save money and it was almost zombie apocalpyse-ish. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The rooms were clean and the service was helpful. We watched Jersey Boys and enjoyed some desserts and coffee in the hotel.
