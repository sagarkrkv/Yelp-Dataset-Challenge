--------------------------------------------------. ESSENTIAL TIPS & EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:. --------------------------------------------------. # Craftsteak is in MGM Grand. Follow the signs to Wet Republic and the floor will change from carpet to smooth concrete. It's on your right, next to Shibuya. . . # The "Hawaiian" bread they serve is whatever so don't eat too much of it.. . # They can do half portions of the salads and side dishes. . # I recommend the Wagyu Skirt Steak (14 oz). It's tasty and has a nice crust. Not too hungry? Split it with 2 ppl. It's pricey at $79, but it's Wagyu.. . # Average steak price is around $60. Cheaper & pricier options available.. . . --------------------------------------------------. MY EXPERIENCE: . --------------------------------------------------. . The walk to Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak is the same walk you'd take to get to Wet Republic, MGM Grand's dayclub. It was close to dinner time when I strolled to the restaurant and as I did, I went past the opposing traffic of Wet Republicans. It was a testament that the pool scene was coming to a close. For them, it was the opposing traffic of a man who lost $120 at the poker tables and ready to blow $140 more on fine dining. Of course, that wasn't obvious to them. I wasn't wearing a scarlet letter "L" for loser or anything. . . [THE ATMOSPHERE]. As a single diner, I just sat in the lounge area of Craftsteak, right by the bar. The area was fine. It overlooked the bar's illuminated collection of whiskeys, gins, vodkas, and other magical tonics. Craftsteak's ambience is familiar and comfortable -- it is clean, sleek, and modern. It's not pitch black like old school steakhouses or brightly lit. The soft yellow lighting, modern furniture, and calm noise level murmurs classy. Surprisingly, I was anti-classy, but felt comfortable in a t-shirt and shorts oddly enough.  The yelpers say "dressy", but I say being dressed in clothes is good enough for this occasion. I don't think they enforce a dress code, but if you have a date do wear a shirt and slacks. Look who I dined with in my plain clothes -- NOBODY. . . [THE FOOD]. You will be served "Hawaiian Bread" sprinkled with sea salt on the top, in a small Staub cast iron cakepan  It's nicely browned on the top. It looks appetizing, smells, appetizing, but why why is the taste underwhelming? The other Yelpers are right. It's too delicate in texture and taste for it to go with steak. I mean the taste is just flat and blander than actual Hawaiian bread. They need a heartier bread. . . I wanted to eat some vegetables instead of eating just steak. However, the side dishes and salads seemed like too much food and a waste of money. At $13-15 for a salad or side dish uhhh probably not.  But, the server allowed me to get half orders of the Persian Cucumber salad and the Snap Peas for my side dish. Now that's more reasonable!  Now, I can get some dose of fiber and vitamins for EDC Day 2 recovery. The Persian Cucumber salad had a nice clean taste, but it was on the plain side. I just tasted fresh leafy greens and light oil with a tiny bit of zest from the ginger. I wanted more OOMMPH from the salad.  If you want a simple salad, this is your dish. Avoid this one if you expect more from your leafy greens. . . My medium-rare Wagyu Skirt Steak (14 oz.) was very tasty for a lack of a better word. It had a decent caramelized crust on both sides and the dish itself was surrounded by a small pool of sauce. I love when I bite into a steak that has a full crust over it -- you get that sweet taste of caramel, marbling fat, and protein in every bite...but my Skirt Steak only had a decent crust so I didn't feel all of the magic. But I will say that the skirt steak was still an excellent choice and highly recommended under the Yelp tips section. I have no idea what kind of reduction was in the steak's pan, but it paired very well with the meat. You couldn't really taste the sauce unless you dipped your fork in and only tasted that. . . My belief on pairings (whether it's wine/meat, sake/fish, sauces/food) is if your taste buds can't really notice the contrast between the 2 flavors, it means they complement each other very well. In my example, the sauce and steak almost blend into each other unnoticed. Hence, a great pairing. The glass of Pinot Noir I got wasn't a perfect pairing with the steak, but it was easy to drink with its fruit and warm spice notes  -- c'mon it's a Pinot. It can do no wrong. I got a serving of fruit out of it. Fruits, vegetables, carbs, and meat...the U.S. government should be proud of me for having a balanced, elitist meal. . . I skipped dessert because it was a no no on the U.S. Food Plate diagram. Just kidding. I was just too full. . . [THE SERVICE] . The server was polite and attentive. Everybody from the water guy to the steak delivery man checked up on you to see if you needed anything or if you were satisfied. I liked the service. I'll see how the service stacks up when I get an actual table with peeps
Went to Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak for my birthday dinner. It was absolutely fabulous! The decor and service were spot on. My wife and I order the Chef's Beef Selection of Domestic Wagyu. It included your choice of appetizer, 2 soups & salads, 3 side dishes and 2 steaks. The shrimp cocktail we had was very tasty shrimp. The lobster bisques was very silky with nice pieces of Maine lobster, very flavorful. They had a seasonal Heirloom tomato salad that my wife loved (I'm not a fan of tomatoes ), and I had the roast red pepper salad which was nicely dressed with good seasoning. For the side we had season squash, a roasted corn special and risotto. Unfortunately the risotto was awful. It was a congealed mess. When we told the waiter he was very apologetic and we subbed out and got the potato gratin. All of the side dishes were nicely done (with the aforementioned risotto) the roast corn was especially good and had some cilantro and bacon. Now the stars, we had the ribeye and filet mignon. They were some of the best steaks we ever had. The filet was the BEST I've ever had and was fork tender! Both were perfectly cook and bursting with great flavor. For desert they bought out a cheesecake with chocolate and walnuts a nicely done dish. Also had fresh seasonal fruit and a scoop of lime and strawberry sobert. I highly recommend Craftsteak, the best steaks and overall just a great dining experience!
It's never a good sign when the side dishes are better then the steaks at a steakhouse. The sweet corn was excellent. Got the filet and it was really tough. Had trouble cutting the steak and it was really chewy. When you drop $$$$, the meat should melt in your mouth and cut like butter. Good ambiance and service, but I've had better steaks at Diners.
Food was absolutely incredible, the only reason I give it four stars is because of the really high prices.  Probably some of the best steak I have ever eaten.  The experience of the 4 course meal was fantastic, our waiter was also very memorable as well, so nice and friendly.  The food is very very good just overpriced in my opinion.
So wonderful! Our new favorite steak place in Vegas. Everything was wonderful: the bread the tomato salad the potato puree the mushroom the corn and the Steak!  My wife and I both had the domestic wagyu hanger steak. Cooked medium rare. The service was great and they did not constantly bother you but they also did not ignore you. Besides the Steak the corn side was the standout. It just made everything taste better. . . My wife and I were too full for dessert but we heard from regulars her that the monkey bread is the way to go if you have room.
Awesome place for a good steak.  The seafood sampler was great. The service was spot on.  Will be back.
Came here after looking at reviews for other steakhouses but since I was staying at the MGM it was convenient.  it was one of the best steaks I had ever had on and the lobster bisque is an explosion in your mouth!!  we had the chefs special which was a lot of food. Make sure you come prepared to eat a lot if your going to order that option next time I'll just order a la carte. try the monkey bread it's outstanding.. bill came out to 302.00 for two people but it's Vegas and it was worth it !! will come back again !!
I went here a few nights ago and there was 4 of us for dinner. We couldn't decide on what to order, since everything on the menu looked so good. After much back and forth, we finally decided to get the chef's selection domestic wagyu. For the Chef's selection, the nice thing about it is, you had to order a minimum of 2 orders, but you didn't have to order for one per person if that makes sense. We had 4 people and we did 3 orders of the domestic wagyu plus the lobster bisque. . . We didn't know what we were going to get, so it was all a surprise. The plate of warm salted bread came out first and I thought that was okay, it was very soft, but it tasted a little dry. Next came out the lobster bisque, even though we just ordered one, our waiter brought out a small bowl for the other 3 to try as well, so I thought that was really nice of him. Next came our appetizers, we had a salad, heirloom tomatoes and there was one more dish, but I can't seem to remember what it was. After the appetizers came our steak, we got 3 different cuts, the filet mignon, the skirt steak and the rib eye with 3 sides, the potatopuree, the brentwood corn (YUM!) and then assorted mushrooms. My favorite was by far the filet mignon, it was so tender, I could cut it with the back of my knife. The skirt steak had a great flavor to it and I think our ribeye may have been cooked medium well, vs the medium rare that we ordered. We didn't finish our steak between 4 people, we were pretty stuffed already and no one really knew if we were getting dessert. 5 minutes later we got 5 dessert dishes, boy were we in for something we couldn't finish. We got an assorted ice cream, mixed fruits, creme brulee, a chocolate cake and finally monkey bread. After this meal I think we all had food coma! . . I would definitely come back here! the food is so delicious and I think I would probably try a different chef's selection next time.
Part of my Vegas traditions is to hit up the steakhouse at the hotel I am staying at. I love steak and I am somewhat of a steak snob. This was the best steak I have ever had hands down. I ordered the Black Angus Filet Mignon and it was amazing. I like my steak on the rare side and when I go to a place that specializes in steak I go medium rare cause they actually know how to do that right. It was perfectly cooked. It was tender and juicy and every bite melted in my mouth. It was a pretty thick steak too but it was still so tender and soft. The knife just went right through it with ease. For my side I ordered the lobster bisque soup and it was good but I have  had better lobster bisque than this at the Luxor steakhouse. It was not as creamy as I would have looked but there was plenty of lobster in it and that was good. It was not bad just not that best. For dessert I went with the caramel cheesecake. It was a hard choice because they have an awesome dessert menu. It was a good choice though. It was downright decadent! It had a perfect mix of caramel and cheesecake flavor. Neither one was overbearing. It was rich and creamy. Every bite was pure heaven! That meal was more than enough to fill me up. . . Not only was the food amazing but so was the customer service. Since I was dining solo I ate at the bar. My server JT was great. He engaged me in great conversation about where we both come from and how he ended up living in Vegas. He was a great server and had awesome customer service skills. I really enjoyed my meal here and would like to come back some day.
Came here for my wife's 40th Bday. Been wanting to try them out because if their ratings and pics looked great. We've tried plenty of high end steak houses in and out of Las Vegas and this place is probably on our top 2 now.  Had the porterhouse and scallops. The Carmel sticky bun is a must for desert.
Overall quite disappointing. Started out with slow service, but they finally got things dialed in and it picked up a bit. Baby Bibb starter salad was huge and delicious. One table mate started with two of every kind of oyster on the menu and thoroughly enjoyed them. . . When the steaks arrived, 3 out of the 4 were tepid and one that was ordered rare was medium at best. We understand the concept of letting steaks rest, but these were napping on the job. We were in a time crunch so we didn't complain too much, but they brought another rare steak out. Sides were ok. . . We all looked at each other after and agreed that it was a bit of a letdown. Oh well, live and learn. Hopefully you learn from this and go to a better steakhouse if you're in Vegas. . . If this was Top Chef, Tom Colicchio would have booted himself off the show had he served himself that meal.
I love Tom Colicchio, really, I do. It pains me to say that my experience at his MGM. restaurant was less than stellar. If this had been "Restaurant Wars," I don't know if we'd see Tom advance to the next round.... . When we approached the hostess desk, four hostesses/servers were present and not one greeted us until about three minutes had passed. . . I had the lobster bisque and found it overwhelmingly over seasoned with cinnamon. It tasted more like cake batter than bisque. . . Next, I had the arugula salad with lemon vinaigrette. They actually refused to add tomatoes to it! For the first time in my life I had to send food back to the kitchen. The taste of lemon was so intense, I felt like I was biting directly into one with each bite. I couldn't muster the courage to finish the dish. . . The risotto that we had as a side had a taste that reminded me Betty Crocker Instant scalloped potatoes. It was sticky and undercooked. . . I must say, the service was wonderful; very attentive and friendly. Other dishes that we got (scallops, Wagyu tartare, and hangar steak) were delicious. . . Overall, a disappointment. I still love. Tom though.
Have been twice. Steaks are very good and flavorful, especially their NY strip. Nice crust and cooked perfectly. Too many servers waiting on the table though and hard to figure out who is in charge.  Tried their raw oysters and one of them was bad and they handled graciously.  Great place beforeor after a show at MGM.
We had a wonderful experience at this lovely restaurant. The Diver's sea scallops were cooked to perfection. Maui onions will blow your mind. I highly recommend eating here.
Lobster bisque was simply amazing... Over the course of a week, I tried 5 different high-end restaurants' bisque (Vegas and San Diego) and none of them came close. . . The Wagyu New York Strip was the best tasting piece steak, outside of some Kobe I had while over in Japan,  that I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. The $35 wine pairings were also a great deal to go with the meal.. . We tried the inclusive wagyu surf and turf meal for 3, so we tried multiple different cuts and sides alongside the items I am recommending above.. . 4 stars for the other items that came with the surf & turf meal.. . 5 stars for the wait staff, the bisque, the wagyu strip steak, and the wine pairings.
Although I have been wanting to try Craft for about a year, I ended up here on a whim. This place exceeded my expectations, by far! . . We began our meal with drinks. There were beers, cocktails, and wine. Tons of options at various prices. I ended up getting the prosecco, which was wonderfully crisp. We settled on the grilled calamari as an appetizer. It was OK, but nothing to rave about. I ended up ordering the surf and turf, which was FANTASTIC. This can easily beshared. The lobster sauce was buttery awesome perfection. However, I think the largest highlight was the monkey bread. An explosion of flavors for sure! . . Overall, the food is great. The drinks are strong. The staff is knowledgable.
Craftsteak is the absolute best way to start off a weekend in Vegas. High class all the way, I have never felt more under-dressed but the staff was so cool Victor, Edgar, and Oscar were on point.. . We started off with a round of drinks, I figured sense we are in Vegas I should have a Nevada brew. The Tenaya Creek IPA was excellent along with the grilled calamari. My lady got the surf and turf while I got the dry aged T-Bone for our entree. Everything was cooked to perfection, that T-Bone steak with the filet and the skirt steak melts. baby spinach and roasted asparagus to compliment all that beautiful red meat.. . Their beer and wine selection was fantastic, I believe they have over a 1000 different bottles to choice from. I also enjoyed the Dogfish 60Minute IPA on tap. To top off the night the table shared their infamous Cinnamon monkey bread and the strawberry shortcake. The atmosphere is wonderful, one of the best meals of my life.
From start to finish it was a wonderful experience. Our server Sharon was very attentive and informative about the entire menu. We went solely on her recommendations and were amazed. We had the New York 14 oz very tender not overwhelming in spices. We also had the garlic potato puree which is such a great accompaniment to the steak. BUT my FAVORITE item on this menu was the monkey bread for dessert. It is out of this world blow your mind delicious. Can't wait for our next trip.
We're staying at the MGM so wanted to eat at a restaurant here. Service is 5 star and so is the food. Had the ribeye bone-in. Magnificent.
celebrated our 13 wedding anniversary here tonight......being 69 years old...I have to say this was the best "gastronomic" experience of our lives...we travel quite a bit around the world, but this tops all of them!!!  The food, the service, the atmosphere....
I am not a big fan of steak restaurants and was out numbered by my coworkers when we voted on where to dine. Craftsteak impressed me. The food was very well presented and prepared. The service was superior , which only added to the experience. I had never tried true wagyu beef and I am glad I did. Truly an excellent steak. Do not and I mean do NOT skip the monkey bread at the end. One of the best desserts you will ever have!
There comes a time when you just go all out.  Whether you are in the right mindset or not, you just go for it.  You don't think about cost or consequences thereafter.  You just close your eyes and hope for the best.  With Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at the MGM, I did just that. I knew it was way over my budget, but I just went with it. Maybe it was the Vegas air and wanted to live the Vegas dream of fine dining. It's not like I won big at the craps tables. I just wanted to "do Vegas right" and dine like I never do.  It's not everyday you get a meal with all of the fixings and trimmings -- maybe when Christmas or Thanksgiving rolls around, but even then, nothing like this -- nothing like having dish after dish after dish, all laid out in front of you. This indeed was something special. Expensive, but special.. . Las Vegas is all about grandeur.  Excess of everything with a splash of flashiness is what everyone expects in Vegas.  Craftsteak, with the interior design and cuisine is a bit dialed down.  Some may see that as something negative, but this was executed with excellence.  The food and the design exuded a sense of humble refinement.  A kind of "my food doesn't have to be extravagant" to be Las Vegas enough, kind of attitude.  Tom Colicchio's menu is simple, and does it elegantly.. . The bread and butter was served in a not so normal cast iron pan. The bread was soft and warm -- the butter was delicious as it should.. . Appetizer: The Lobster Bisque was near perfection. The way they did it was unique and interesting. The soup bowl had nothing inside expect spices and chunks of lobster. The waiter then poured in the hot bisque inside the bowl. The taste was amazingly delicious. Lobster chucks filled every spoonful. The bisque was rich and creamy and full of seafood flavor. The Lobster Bisque itself was well worth the experience.. . Appetizer: The Itallian buffalo mozzarella with hazelnuts was mellow. Not robust in flavors, the taste was a bit subtle. The tomatoes and balsamic helped round out the flavors. The mozzarella was fresh as can be.. . Appetizer: The Warm Frisee salad had some intense flavors going on -- a great thing. It had a farm egg, smoked bacon, mustard seed, and blue cheese. The bacon and blue cheese were rich and fatty, and the mustard seed helped cleanse the palate. Intense tastes and bitter greens made this dish amazing.. . Appetizer: Their Caesar salad was a bit bland. I dug the pickled anchovy though.. . The Ribeye is one of my favorite cuts of steak. Mine was 16 oz, bone in, cooked to a medium rare. Perfectly cooked, I couldn't ask for a better piece of meat. Each bite was perfect texturally, but I felt it lacked seasoning. Maybe the rich flavors of the appetizers killed my taste buds, but the Ribeye could have used some salt. Heck, this might be cheating, but I would have loved some blue cheese on the side. Translation: I love blue cheese.. . Interestingly, the 22 oz T Bone had a better flavor for me -- it must be the dry aging process. It had a rich beef flavor that was missing from the Ribeye. Still cooked perfectly, the meat was succulent and tender.. . Side: The yukon potato puree was amazing. It was such a simple dish. It was rich with a lot of butter and cream. The taste was like no other. It was smooth and delicious and the chives on top gave it enough zest to keep me coming back for more.. . Side: The assorted mushrooms were a perfect accompaniment to the meat. What's better that meat and potatoes than adding mushrooms in the mix? They each had a different bite to it.. . Side: Another potato other than the puree was the potatoes gratin. The potato slices were mixed in with a roasted garlic cream. The taste was perfect with the meat.. . Dessert: I thought monkey bread pudding was a funny name for a dessert, but the taste was addicting. The bread was sweet and dense, kind of like a cinnamon bun. The rich caramel sauce with the bread pudding and ice cream all mixed well perfectly.. . Dessert: I always see cactus pear sorbet on TV, and always wanted to try it. I was pleasantly surprised, and I fell in love with it. The taste was very mellow and not too sweet. The color of the sorbet was vibrant as was the flavors. The fruit slices, candied dates and dragon fruit were mediocre. My favorite fruit is the Asian pear -- I like it because it has a nice bite to it with a lot of juice. The pear sliced wafer thin gave it no bite and not a lot a moisture. The dragon fruit was exotic, and taste was mild. None of this fruit mess. I am in Vegas -- more Monkey Bread Pudding Please!. . Dessert: The most decadent dessert was the chocolate moose. The chocolate in this was super chocolatey and dense. The vanilla ice cream was as pure as can be, but the peaches on the side didn't excite me.. . Tom Colicchio's steakhouse was in the end, worth it.  Plate after plate, dish after dish, the food seamed endless.  The impeccable service and comfortable seating arrangements made this long endeavor a treat I will never forget.
We really liked the oysters, and the surf n turf. The scallops were perfectly cooked. The 6 oz filet mignon was cooked perfectly too, but that was a very small 6 oz steak. The side dishes were a generous size though, and both the fingerling potatoes and the glazed carrots were delicious. . I had the key lime martini and it was the best drink ever. I swear, I could've had 10 of them!
