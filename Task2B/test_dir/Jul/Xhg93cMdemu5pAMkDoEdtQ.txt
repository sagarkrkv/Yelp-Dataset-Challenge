The only thing I order from Serendipity is the famous frozen hot chocolate. You must be thinking, "How do they make hot chocolate FROZEN?" Well, you just have to come here and see for yourself. It's the most amazing drink ever, and it definitely hits the spot on a hot Vegas day. I have never eaten inside; I always order it outside to go. I make it my point to try to go to Serendipity to get the frozen hot chocolate whenever I'm in Vegas. Although it's $11 for a drink, I still go there anyways to get my fix. It's really that good. If you're a fan of hot chocolate or just chocolate, come here to try it! You won't be disappointed.
I've been to Serendipity several times during my various trips to Vegas. Its a great casual restaurant located right on the strip. It has a cute little whimsical vibe that simply makes me happy every time I come here. . . Serendipity is known for desserts, including frozen hot chocolate and the $1,000 golden opulence sundae. (Yes, $1,000... don't think I'll ever try that one unless I hit it big in the casino.) The frozen hot chocolate is very rich and tasty, and definitely a good thing to try while in the hot desert. During my most recent trip, my husband and I spilt the cookie sundae. The two of us together couldn't even finish it! Cookie dough ice cream mixed with three fresh baked cookies and topped with whipped cream and hot fudge... yum!. . All of the food I've ever had here has been pretty solid as well. The triple decker grilled cheese is my favorite. It's so flippin' cheesy and gooey! I love it! The portions are all very large and can easily be split between two... especially if you're planning on dessert. . . I always look forward to my next trip to Vegas, and Serendipity has become one of those staples for me that make the trip so great and fun.
Came here for the first time to try the frozen hot chocolate with the guys. thought it was just a random bar from the outside. waited about 15 minutes so we chilled out in the patio out front and people watched. Text us when our table was ready. Server was very cheeful and pleasant. Took our order, 3 frozen hot chocolates, order of onion ring tower, tacos and sliders. Food came pretty quick, Tacos and sliders were okay, enjoyed the onion rings. Looked for our server and couldn't find him for awhile, our water glasses were needing a refill. overall good experience.
I've been here twice now, the first time we waited 40 minto get a seat and eat. I recall the burgers and appetizers being decent, and the frozen hot chocolate was absolutely delicious! However, the long waits and slow service was not worth it.. . Came back a second time to again enjoy their frozen hot chocolate, and sat at the bar. We got the oreo, and it was okay this time.. It came almost right away which we found kind of odd, and it seems like someone's old order they returned and they left it in the fridge. It was kind of melty and we got our frozen hot chocolate with a pool of hot chocolate on the plate that it came with.. so messy and dirty. $12 for one but if you share with some theres a $4 extra charge.. I guess. Overall was okay and would only be back for the hot chocolate.. if I didnt get a Fat Tuesday first.
This place is very very over hyped in my opinion. Came here because most of the buffets in Vegas had already cut off their lines and my friends have been wanting to give it a try. The dining wait was about 45 minutes and by this time, we were all already too hangry to wait so we ordered in the outside togo/patio area instead. . . I got myself a bacon cheeseburger and fries. My burger was very bland and had no flavor at all. The meat wasn't even juicy, just dry. :( The fries were mediocre at best. I did try some of my friend's frozen hot chocolate (which is what they're famous for), and it was probably the best thing I had. . . Probably best to only grab the frozen hot chocolates here!
Nice variety of dessert, including ice cream sundaes but very slow service! Took forever to receive the check. Try the fried oreo sundae the next time you check this place out. . . This is also the restaurant that sells a sundae made out of gold for $1,000!
Frozen hot chocolate is still wonderful but save yourself the trouble and get it to go from the booth outside.  The hostess tonight told me they were 'fully committed' and had no more seats available for the whole night.  While standing outside, I overheard her tell the next couple that there was a slight wait and they would be seated in 25 minutes.  Not sure what I did to offend her but no dessert is worth such horrible service.
Biggest piece of cake I've ever seen! I had the roasted veggie sandwich and it was good. After I tasted my niece's frozen hot chocolate and it was a taste treat! The wait was a bit long and our poor waiter (tho GREAT) was a bit overtaxed, but all in all something you really OUGHT to do if you're there anyway! But be warned if you want to TALK to someone you're with... IT'S LOUDER than a 70's Pimp Suit!
Nothing like the Serendipity in NYC. We were very disappointed with our order. We ordered a banana split and they left out the strawberry ice cream and the ice cream was melted with melted whip cream. Our waiter David was ok but didn't seem to believe that our order was missing the strawberry ice cream. I guess he couldn't tell being that our order looked like a shake instead of a banana split. We will never return to this Serendipity
Visited recently for a late night dessert while in Vegas for a work conference.  As a result of a bad stand by wait during a previous visit, I made sure to make a reservation weeks ahead of time and it sure paid off.  My friend and I arrived at 9:50pm for our 10:00pm Saturday night reservation and were immediately seated.  Our waitress arrived at our table promptly and had large glasses of ice water to us almost immediately!  Knowing what we wanted ahead of time...frozen hot chocolates...we ordered quickly.  The waitress forewarned us that the kitchen was a bit backed up, but managed to get us our orders within 5 minutes.  Well, mostly...she accidentally picked up a mint frozen hot chocolate instead of the traditional one that I ordered.  Quickly resolved, I had a new, fresh frozen hot chocolate in front of me!  As usual, it was amazing and perfect for a hot evening in Las Vegas!  This is one of those Vegas must-do's!!
After hearing my gf talk about the "frozen hot chocolate" for so long, we stopped by S3 on our last Vegas trip. I still don't get why it's called frozen and hot, but whatever... The drink itself was way too sweet to enjoy. It was almost chalky/powdery. On the flip side, the food was good.. . They were out of the fried chicken and waffles... At 11am. Kinda disappointed, but I got the "Saints and Sinners" french toast log instead. WOW!!! It was amazing! Best french toast ever! The bread was so soft and fluffy. Didn't get the taste of egg.. . The omelettes aren't bad either. I always get mine with egg-whites. they don't skimp on the egg whites like most places. There was just way too much cheese on it; More than any other ingredient. Did I mention the french toast was bomb? Git it!
This is usually a treat for my friends from out of town. Locals generally stick to respective sides of town and only venture out when they have guests. Love the frozen hot chocolate and I've had that Golden Opulence dessert with a client of mine.  Price is high, its a bit cramped at times and there is a horde of tourists outside, but a fun place to say you've gone to. Cheers
WOW.  what a let down.  My very first impression of this place: DIRTY.  As I opened the menu, my second thought was, "EXPENSIVE!"  was this ice cream made of gold?  I mean, even for Vegas, it was expensive.  . . My husband and I decided to share a sundae.  Overpriced, melty, took like 25 minutes... why??  It's ice cream, not a beer wellington!  Won't be going back.
Fried bar food disguised as trendy cuisine. This place survives on name and location.
Had a great lunch at here! Triple grilled cheese and a Stella. Exactly what I was looking for. Travis was a great help and gave me some dessert suggestions. Deep fried Twinkie sundae won out in the end. Come hungry:)
Very fun casual setting with an outdoor patio right on the strip great for people watching... I have not tried their food but this is a must stop to try their famous frozen hot chocolate!  It's a nice sweet treat that comes in multiple flavors (some even with alcohol) to help beat the Vegas summer heat
This place has some of the most amazing desserts I've ever seen... And the food looks amazing as well... My only complaint is against the staff... First we had to wait in line for about 20 min outside where it was like 105 degrees outside and when we got to the desk we were told it would be a half hour wait... (No problem, it's worth it) but then the girl at the front desk just sat there and rolled her eyes and talked crap about all the customers! "I said you have to wait outside" that is not my problem" just stupid little remarks like that under her breathe about everyone who talked to her.... If you hate your job that much then go find another one!!
The original frozen hot chocolate was great! Defiantly use the to-go window instead of waiting 30 min for a table because it's pretty much the same menu available (unless you really care to have the sit down experience). They unfortunately didn't have every flavor version of the frozen hot chocolate wasn't available when I went that's why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars.
We made a reservation online - it was 7PM and said we couldn't get in until 10:30 - then we went there at 8PM and got sat immediately - hmmmmm.... . The wait staff- which was all men - no women while we were there - was all very aloof, giving off a "you are lucky to be eating here" kinda vibe - annoying.... . the footlong chili dog i split was great (thus the 2nd star). . then we waited over TWENTY minutes for our desert... which had a TON of chocolate on that and my guest was a little overwhelmed by the amount of chocolate - not a bad problem to have i guess.. . But when we asked the mananger what they normally do when someone doesn't actually like their dish she was so incredibly rude - Sodie (sp?) was her name - that I it turned me off completely.. . I will never go back to this place again - over rated and a tourist trap.  I used to go to the original one in NYC in the 90's and i met the wonderful owners several times - they would have never stood for this kind of behavior towards customers.... . oh well - took three tries to get a table in the past - thought it would be the best experience of the week - but ended up our worst
So my family went to Vegas to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Of course this is the perfect place to sing to her. I'm willing to spend $200-$300 for our family. We came in and it was 100 degree outside, we were all tired and hungry.  Then this family came and cut in, this lady ( the mom) cut in with a straight face and didn't even care cause she knows she's doing it on purpose. My husband told her husband we were in line but I said to him it's ok cause they were only party of 3 and we have 6 in our group anyway. Then I told my husband, "just be grateful your not married to that kind of woman." And the husband heard, the husband and her kid was embarrassed by that woman's attitude. People, don't embarrass your family just for a table! Anyway, so we got our table....our waitress asked what we want for a drink, I gave her our order and I said that's all and I said "That's all"....and she said, "that's all you are going to order". And I'm thinking for a drink "yes". She left and I saw her whispering to another waitress, and I'm like..... hmmmm???? Then I came close To her register and asked to sing for my daughter, so she said to order a desert, so I did and she  brought the sundae with a candle and DIDN'T even sing to my daughter.... She just left it on our table. So we just sang to my daughter, just us!!!! How RUDE!!!! Our waitress is this black lady, that looks like a unemployed stripper/semi retired prostitute. And she's also too slow!!! Then we were waiting to order, looking at their yummy looking food. And we can't understand why she's taking too long to come back. After 30 minutes she came back with a receipt!!!! WTF!!!!! There's six of us and we only ordered drinks and you thought that's all we're ordering!!!! Dumb waitress!!!! We're celebrating my daughter's birthday!!! Anyway we were so pissed that we just decided to leave. This place is understaff..... their sundae are too sweet, the frozen chocolate drink that everyone is talking about is too grainy. YuKkk!!! And they have one dumb black waitress that needs training. I can't believe I didn't check her name. The other waitress seem nice and faster. But she's just too slow and obviously this place is under staff. They overcharge people and their understaff. Ridiculous!!!! Never will I come to this place again!
Well below average and not worth going to. This is the most over rated restaurant on the strip. I think Paris Hilton made it famous by having their overpriced dessert, and that alone should have told me that it is going to be a bad experience.. . As others have also posted, we had reservations and were on a time crunch for a lunch break between meetings, which is why we made reservations. We had about an hour and a half to eat before my wife had to return to her conference. Well after waiting 45 minutes to be seated after the time our reservation was set for, and then another 15 minutes for our server to show up, we made the mistake of ordering.. . Well, my wife did not get to eat because the food took so long and she had to return to her conference. I stuck around for our server to finally re-appear and had them box up our food, which never made it to our table. . . After all that the food and fries were less then average and not worth the time, effort, or money it took to get them. There are a hundred better places to eat in Vegas, don't be fooled by this place!
Not a fan of their burgers. Looks good but too dry! Tried their famous frozen hot chocolate. Taste was okay. Thought I can make the same kind of drink on my own.
Our server was very friendly and nice. He knew were burnt and tired from Edc, he even told us he's been for 11 years 0_0 That's pretty crazy and cool! . . The portions here are humungo! I shared with my friend and ateit myself. There was still no dent made in the pasta haha. . . We all got to-go boxes for our orders. . . YOU HAVE TO GET FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE (the original one)!!! . . Don't get white chocolate frozen hot chocolate, it's too sweet, we couldn't even drink it.
After being forced to watch the movie, I knew I wanted to try out this ice cream shop!  I've been avoiding stopping by since this place is always busy.  I mean lines wrapping around and everything!  That means it must be good, right? So on one of my recent trips, I decided to brave the sun and the long line and tried me some Serendipity.. . I only tried one thing on the menu so this review will be a short one.  I had the much talked about Frozen Hot Chocolate.  It was decent, the serving size was overkill, and it was a truly decadent and rich treat.  It was just a little too sweet and powdery for my liking and I think it had more whipped cream than actual frozen hot chocolate.  I think I would much rather spend my money inside Caesar's Palace at a delicious dessert shop with the best macarons ever.  For a frozen hot chocolate though, I think I'll stick with San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square.. . This ice cream shop is sickeningly cute.  Like every other place on The Strip, the theme is rampant and the atmosphere is worth a few selfies for Instagram.  Stop by if you're an ice cream fanatic.  I hope you don't mind the wait and the obvious tourist trap that makes up Serendipity.
I went here last year on my trip to VEGAS with a friend and we made this a "must eat" place. The portions are huge, you can easily split an appetizer with 3-4 people and an entree can serve anywhere from 2-4 people. The food was just as tasty as it was gigantic. We got the nachos, which I would recommend and I got the hangover which is basically eggs with EVERYTHING. I would say go with a larger group and split. Plates or if you go with only 2. People Agree on something and split it. Between the Two of you. They are great about wrapping things to go but the Vegas heat will do a number on your. Food if you aren't going To a show or back to your hotel, we saw LOVE right after so everything was fine.
This is a review for their TOGO food menu:. . I ordered the works hot-dog. A foot long, and $11. Worth it? I think not. Go towards the Venetian from Quad and you'll see a foot long selling for $2. The pizza my friend ordered (BBQ Chicken) is probably more worth your money but still not amazing either. And no free tap water, really? Oh Vegas, how you dehydrate us. . . I feel like my experience might have been better if I did sit down inside the restaurant rather than taking togo. But maybe another day if I'm in the mood for frozen hot chocolate.
Came here yesterday before leaving vegas and had the worst experience ever here.   We sat outside and they had one waiter, for like 50 people so everything took forever to get but that is not the waiters fault.  The food part was good when we finally got it but the dessert which was a, deep fried snicker sundae came out almost fully melted so we sent it back and the second wasn't much better.  It was 11 in the morning so the ice cream, should have been nice and cold and firm not a running liquid mess and the deep fried snickers weren't even deep fried they were cold and just taken out of a package. The whole visit took 2 hour when it should have only tooken a little over an hour cause the food was ready but the waiter just couldnt get to it because of dealing with so many people by himself.  Very disappointed visit to this place.
One of my favorite places to eat in vegas. Food is great, though pricey - but that's the norm on the strip. Desserts are amazing and they have a $5 happy hour which is awesome. Sat at the bar last time I visited and the bartender was rude and unfriendly but that won't stop me from returning next time I'm in vegas. Highly recommended !
I recently went here for a birthday. We came solely for dessert. My little sis and I ordered a frozen hot chocolate to share. Normally, the presentation of their desserts are on point, but this time it was different. My frozen hot chocolate was melting and dripping over the cup before we were even able to take our first bite. I recommend this place but demand a new one if your dessert appears this way.
I've eaten at this restaurant a few different times, and I must say that I'm a huge fan.  It's located just outside of Caesar's Palace, and is considered one of the more "affordable" restaurants in Vegas.  I put affordable in quotes, because it's obviously a relative term.  It's still not exactly cheap, but the food and desserts are both really good.  First off, the portion size of the sandwiches and burgers are huge.  I had a burger on our first visit, It had bacon and blue cheese on it, and came with a ton of fries.   Their sandwiches could most definitely be split between two people if you aren't starving hungry.  If you eat a whole sandwich or burger by yourself, trust me you won't have room for dessert.  My wife and I learned this on our second trip, as we simply spilt a chicken sandwich and fries, which was more than plenty for the both of us.. . We splurged and got this cookie sundae for dessert.  It was huge!  It came with a few scoops of cookie dough ice cream, and had a few homemade cookies on top, along with hot fudge and whipped cream.  Makes me hungry just thinking about it now.  If you split a meal and a dessert, you can walk out of here for less than $40 including tip.  Some folks may consider that expensive.  Again, affordable is a relative term. :)  . . I'm a big fan of this place, and would go back here anytime.  I have to thank my wife for helping discover this place.  Check it out if you're in Vegas!
:(  Here's the TL;DR. . - Average food for above average price. - Meals were cold when served. . These are the facts:. . I made a reservation to celebrate my 5th wedding anniversary, I let the hostess know when I called and when I arrived that we were celebrating with our family and that most of us drove from out of state to have this meal, we were super excited. . . We sat nestled between the entrance and the hostess desk so that half of the table had the privilege of scooting our chairs for other parties being seated farther in the back, and the other table got to sit with the 3 hostesses' booties on their neck all evening.. . We ordered drinks which were refilled only once during our pleasant 2 hour stay. . . Our orders were taken about 30 minutes from our being seated, but we didn't receive our food for another hour.. . These are not my feelings, these are the cold, hard facts.. . Cold and hard like the $26 fried chicken my husband ordered. His mashed potatoes were a soupy consistency. I have a picture if you wanna see.. . My ABC Chicken sandwich was okay, the C stands for caramelized onions, but it was cold by the time I got a hold of it so they were more like soggy worms. Okay, that's not a fact, I don't know what worms are like but I can imagine.. . More facts:. Someone in our party ordered a burger with no pink, but when he bit into it it was still bloody. The waiter did pop by 30 minutes later and asked if he wanted it remade but everyone's bubble had been burst by then. . . I told the manager I wasn't happy with my experience or the quality of the food. She was offended when I compared it to Red Robin, but I've never had a cold meal or left dissatisfied, so I think I did Red Robin a disservice by comparing these two. Sorry big red bird.. . After the manager got over her indignation, she comped us a sundae. So our party of 8 shared a sundae. Kudos lady, thanks.. . I felt bad that my family wasted time and money here. It was my decision and I have to live the rest of my life with that on my shoulders. Maybe I'll write the company instead of writing a passive-aggressive review on a third-party site... I think I'll do that.
We ate there this weekend. Food was terrible, service was worse. My husband ordered the ctab cake sandwich and took 1 bite. Server never ask how was our food. We will never go back
I've been here a couple of times, and they do seem to rest firmly on the reputation of their NYC location and not put much of an effort into anything when it comes to the service.. . Ultimately it is just not quite worth it to go unless you are really jonesing for a Frozen Hot Chocolate.  The location is terrible if that is the only place you are going to, and the prices are far too high for what you end up getting.
Pros:. - We had a pizza (can feed 2 not-too-hungry people), coffee, a hot chocolate, and a kids' sliders meal. All the food and drinks were great.. - We sat outside on the patio. Very comfortable. Nice view.. - Our server (a huge burly man with a plethora of arm tattoos) was ultra-friendly, make things very comfortable, and even covered our drinks! Wish I knew his name. Shout-out!. . Cons:. - A little bit pricey for what it is, but then again, so is everything on the LV strip. . . Overall: The great service highlighted our experience, but the food will also satisfy.
I only wanted to try this place out because Blair & Serena from Gossip Girl would reference this place. As a faithful follower, of course I had try this place out. I've attempted to actually dine and eat in the restaurant numerous times- but it was always so crowded. I definitely recommend making a reservation because this place is always jammed packed. If you can't make it inside, they do have an outdoor to go window where you can get their famous hot chocolate and other sweet & savory goodies.. . As for the food itself, I've tried the classic frozen hot chocolate and the red velvet sundae. The hot chocolate honestly just tastes like a thicker milkshake..nothing tok special, & definitely over hyped. I personally liked the red velvet sundae better. Also, beware! These servings are huge and should be shared in my opinion :)
Our last meal in Vegas before heading home :( we came for breakfast on a Saturday morning at 9:30am, and were happy (and unsurprised) to find plenty of open tables.  Delicious hangover omelette and chocolate chip pancakes.  Our server was friendly and wonderful.  I got a frozen hot chocolate to go because I couldn't bear the thought of leaving without trying it.  It was delicious and frosty on a hot morning.  Can't wait to come back!
meh
Soooo, made a reservation for a Monday afternoon (yes, it was busy) but seated ubber quick and tried to narrow down our lunch choices from the ginormous menu. . So, food... Eh. Not awesome, not bad. . Frozen amaretto hot chocolate...freaking amazing. . Banana split (small portion) tasty...and HUGE. . . Think we'll stop by again but just for dessert this time... Better dinner/lunch spots than this.
Splitting a frozen milkshake is a fantastic romantic date!
A necessary visit in this crazy heat, as we walked from Bally's to Caesar's over the ramps and what really attracted us to make a pit stop was more b/c of the outdoor seating with the spray-mist to cool us down in this crazy heat of 40 C degrees.. . Ordered the sundae, and really didn't think it was anything special, but it's presented nice.  Just didn't like the long lineups for this.. . Yet, it's a more than decent place to take a date to lol.. . Happy hour available with a few option between lunch and dinner.
I've lived in Vegas for over 25 years and this place by far is the most underwhelming restaurant on the strip I've ever been too. Not to mention when the menus were slapped down on the table it left some piece of food smashed on it. Really yummy. Chunks of food under our table. The backs of the chairs had all sorts of splatter marks of food or who knows what. Yummy. Believe me, I'm all about making money and I'll spend money on food but to charge $5 for a fountain drink is offensive! I will never be back and I am so glad I didn't bring an out of town guest here or I would have been embarrassed.
Service was pathetically slow.  Sat down for 15 minutes before our waitress appeared.  Finally got our food after 30 minutes of waiting. Keep in mind that it was 9:30 am on a Sunday and there weren't lots of people, so I don't understand the slow service. We got help from 2 other waitresses yet the service was still slow. I ordered the hangover omelet and it was bland. The frozen hot chocolate is delicious but the overall experience made it not worth it. Do yourself a favor and skip this place.
It's was okay.. . Don't get me wrong, I loved loved the serendipity in NYC when I visited. From the decor to the service to the atmosphere, everything was so charming. This was however feels much more like a diner, with the prices of high end American food... . Having said that, I do admit the portions are quite large, easily sharable. (Although the $4 split plate charge is ridiculous). . . And the desserts are delicious. . . My suggestion? Spend your money somewhere else, like Earl of sandwiches and come here for late night desserts.
best ice cream!
Came here with a big group of people for breakfast.  Service was well and food was great.
Pricey, but this is to be expected for a restaurant on the strip. The regular frozen hot chocolate is our family favorite over the other flavors.
I have been hearing about this place for quite a while now so I decided that it was time to try it out. I would love to have been able to try the food and write a review based on that, but unfortunately I didn't even have the opportunity to try their food so my review is solely based on SERVICE.. . I came in on a Monday morning which meant that it was fairly slow. We had to walk around asking the waiters if we sit anywhere or if there was someone to seat us, in which they just pointed to one direction and told me to speak with the hostess. Not a big deal. After we spoke to the hostess, she was able to seat us down promptly and gave us menus. The waitress came by with waters for us and told us she'd be back shortly to take our order. 15 minutes later, she came to take our drink order. A friend of mine ordered a coke and the rest of us was content with our water. She came back with the coke and left sooner than we could ask to put our order in. So we sat there patiently and waited for her. 15 minutes later, we see her walking around and talking to customers and still have not come back to simply take our order. At this point, we ran out of patience and decided to leave. Right when we were about to leave, she came back and asked if we were ready. I told her that we decided to leave instead and she had the nerve to charge my friend for her UNTOUCHED coke. We were so furious that we just gave her the EXACT cash and left. Didn't take her name or collect the reciept which I wish I would have so I could include it this review.. . I am very big on service, but I am understanding in certain scenarios. But 30 mins of waiting on a slow day to simply take our order is definitely unacceptable. I don't even care to try their food anymore. It seemed overpriced and nothing special. Instead, I walked across the street to The Quad and had Hash House instead; for half the price, the service was top knotch and it was extremely busy there. You can read my review for that location because I will definitely be giving them a five star after compared to this horrible experience with Serendipity 3.
I'm never stepping foot in this place again.  Service is generally slow, but waiting 30 minutes for food was a bit excessive.  To top it off our server was not friendly, and he admittedly forgot to ring in a drink I ordered in the beginning.  Our food came out cold, my burger wasn't cooked at the right temperature, and the pasta we ordered needed a heavy hand of salt.. . Overpriced, mediocre food, with crap service- not even worth it.. . This place should stick to being desserts only.
LOVE this place! It's a must for us every time we visit Vegas. The portions are huge and the food is delicious! We ordered the nachos and steak sandwich, which easily could have fed 4 adults. The service was speedy, our waitress was knowledgeable, and the prices aren't bad for the amount of food you get.
I really wanted to like this place, but didn't.  If you want to overpay for mediocre food & service, you've come to the right place.   I'd only recommend coming here for dessert, but if you're coming for the food and shakes, think again...In & Out Burger's not too far away (and better)!
The best sundae I've had so far! I got the Lookie Lookie give me cookie Sundae. . The portions are huge and one dessert is definitely enough for two, unless you are really hungry! . The service was fine, we got our table after 15 minutes, and our waiter was great. . I would say the price was good compared to what we got served. You may be spending a little bit extra on a dessert, but you get what you pay for. . If you ever go to Vegas, Serendipity3 Is worth stopping by for a late-night snack.
best place
Frozen hot chocolate! I'm sure that's exactly what everyone else said too, but do it! It's seriously delicious. The food is a bit above your average diner food and pretty expensive considering the location.. . They have weird hours too. The last few times I've been to Vegas they've been closed earlier than their posted hours or they were just closed for the day entirely. . . Fun place though. Good location, pretty good food and a loud fun atmosphere.
So, I loved going to the serendipity in Miami, but Las Vegas Serendipity 3 does not measure up. The desserts arealways phenomenal, but the chili that my wife loved in Miami was not good here. It didn't taste or look luxurious like it did in Miami. It looked and tasted like hamburger meat versus being cubed with a slight sweetness in Miami. On a happier note, the wings were pretty good and the "outrageous banana split" was excellent. . . Overall: would go somewhere for lunch/ dinner and would come to Serendipity 3 for dessert.
Finally had time to stop by the infamous Serendipity this time this time around and it was just alright. The wait was quite long as expected. You would think that, being in the middle of the desert, there would be more space where you wait but there were three chairs and everyone was super cramped.. . We ordered three different Frozen Hot Chocolates; The Original, White Chocolate, and the one with coffee. All three were way too sweet. It was like drinking chocolate syrup. The White Chocolate was the richest, it tastes like nougat. We all agreed that the best tasting one was the coffee one.. . There are also Frozen Hot Chocolate mixes for sale. The pouches are $7 and cans are $19.
This is a popular joint here along the strip, but the lines here isn't worth the food you're waiting for.  Sugar factory is  much better alternative if you don't have the 45 minutes to spend waiting to be seated.
Pretty good. Our waiter was awesome andvery attentive. It was a little pricey, but that's Vegas for you. I had the BBQ chicken pizza that was recommended by out waiter. It was decent.
Every time i come to Vegas I usually stop here for the kids.the food is overpriced and not that great.but they love the frozen hot chocolate sundaes.there expensive, but the memories are worth every penny!!
Was in Las Vegas with some friends last weekend, we went for brunch on Saturday around noon. After a 30 minute wait we got the lucky table by the door and my sister kept being brushed up against by people coming in and leaving! Our food took another 30 minutes to come out. Not only did it come out cold, but my friend ordered a rare steak, came out medium well! . I give it 2 stars because our server was fantastic. He let us know right away that the food would be slow to come out. When we complained about our food he was able to get some of it comped and he brought us free dessert! We all felt really bad for him because he kept apologizing for everything when clearly it was not his fault! . If you want a good brunch, skip this place, not worth it.
My wife and I stopped in while on our anniversary date night out, unfortunately it was the low point of our night. We started at the outside window but were ignored until we said something and were treated rude so we went inside. As soon as we walked we got hit with a disgusting odor. It smelled like dirty feet and a gym room...ACK!!! The interior is very cheap as well. We made our way over to the tiny bar and ordered overpriced drinks from their less than subpar selection. This took awhile too but then headed outside where we could breathe again. My beer was warm and my wife's drink was sour and gross. The outside waiter was rude and couldn't answer a simple question. We finally decided to go elsewhere and revive our night. This place does not represent Caesar's Palace well at all. I will not recommend this place to anyone or return ever again.
Only come here for their dessert, honestly.  Their food is greasy and average at best but the Frozen Hot Chocolate is to die for and something to experience.. . Onion Ring Tower: This is probably the only acceptable dish here.  . Steak and Egg Sandwiches: Huge ass sandwich.  Serving is 2 or more.  The sandwich is super greasy and the steak itself was tough.  . Frozen Hot Chocolate: Saves this restaurant from a 1 or 2 star.  It is super heavenly and the presentation is magnificient.  I wouldn't share this with anyone if I had the choice.
It was a SUPER hot day out when we went to visit Las Vegas and Serendipity 3 was kind of an oasis for us. They have a large indoor seating area that is kind of reminiscent of a candy store/50s diner hybrid. We didn't actually get food there, or sit in the restaurant for that matter. We were in search of the frozen hot chocolate we had heard so much about. The indoor seating area was pretty packed when we went so we went to the bar/patio area outside that is facing the strip. . . The bartender was very nice and had our frozen hot chocolate out in a jiffy. Needless to say, the cold drink hit the spot on that scorching day. However, while the coldness of the drink cooled me down, I realized that the hot chocolate powder doesn't really dissolve leaving a kind of gritty and super sugary taste. Also, in the outdoor seating area, they spray water mist, which was both great and a little uncomfortable at the same time while I was trying to enjoy my drink. The mist was starting to form a layer of water on my skin, I could only imagine what it could do to my food. It was $17 for a double size frozen hot chocolate which was also a little pricey in my opinion. All together, if you have a big sweet tooth and are looking to have something on a hot day, this might be the place (and treat) for you if you are willing to spend money. Otherwise, I wouldn't really recommend making a special trip out here just for the drink.
It's good for desserts...famous for the frozen hot chocolate.  But really all of the sundaes and cake are delicious.  Definitely a must-try for all the sweet-tooths out there!  I think the food is ok and there are definitely many American options (salads, burgers, sandwiches, pizza, etc), but really it's about the treats!
Love the pistachio frap. Delicioso!
The frozen hot chocolate is a bit overrated.The milkshakes are overpriced and not that great.They actually charge you an extra couple dollars if you want to split an entree with someone.The food is usually pretty good,and it's one of the more affordable places to eat on the strip
I work at a restaurant on the strip, and when people ask for recommendations, I always name this place. Every single person I've taken here loves it. The food is great with big portions, and the service is amazing!!! Definitely a must in vegas. . . I usually only come here for breakfast, can't go wrong with that.
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right? I wish that were true, but I seem to have the memories of our Brunch at Serendipity. Our group of 4 guys arrived around noon for...brunch I guess. At least it was brunch time. There wasn't a wait for a table even though we wanted to be seated inside. We were ready to order pretty quickly, but it took our waitress quite a long while to collect our drink order (which was 3 waters and a coffee). Once we finally ordered, two of us settled on Omelets and two went with sandwiches. Then the wait began again..  . About 20 minutes later, the food finally arrived. The omelets were normal size, but very plain. The omelet was very dry, as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while (trust me, it was Vegas in July, I knew the feeling of sitting under a heat lamp)..  . My cup of fruit was not quite a full measuring cup size, but it did have fresh berries and melons, which was nice. I'm told the sandwiches were quite good and obnoxiously large. One friend ordered the steak and eggs which turned out to be about a pound of steak, an 18" hoagie, 3 fried eggs, and bacon..  . When we finished our meal, we looked around for the waitress. Then we waited. Then we waited. Then we waited. Then we waited. You get the point. Then she finally came and told us she would bring the check. Then we waited. Then we waited. Finally we got the check and continued in our waiting pattern for her to come back for our cards, run them, and bring our cards back..  . For all future Vegas trips, I intend to skip this place unless I'm looking to eat a mediocre, overpriced 30 minute meal that is leisurely crammed into 90 minutes. Normally this would be a 1 star review, but my fiends enjoyed their sandwiches at least so I'm being generous.
Not really sure what all the fuss is about. . It is poorly located and feels out of place. The food was pretty average. I had the skirt steak and it was actually greasy, and bland. If its going to be greasy at least it should have some flavor. The frozen hot chocolate was good, but not amazing. The scenery was fine, I get what they are trying to do, but its contrived and just seems out of place. Funny thing is that I really want to like it, but the food was just not good. I will try again in hopes that it was a bad night.
Not the greatest of foods but their dessert is worth it!. . Buffalo wings as an appetizer - decent. Plain burger - it was pretty good but there was a lot of bun. Fried chicken & mashed potatoes - the chicken wayyy over-fried . . I would possibly go back and order the burger but the selling point to get me there would be the frozen hot chocolate.  Definitely a must try!
I ordered a shake (I think) from here, or some kind of desert that tasted like sweet, chocolatey water with whip cream. I added Reese's cups to it for an extra 1.50 thinking id get many. When it came out, there was only 3 mini Reese's cups. Yeah it was gross and not worth the money. Plus the cups looked all disgusting and we didn't get water until we were leaving! . A nice customer shared this huge piece of chocolate cake and then we left.
Frozen Peanut Butter Hot Chocolate?!?! Nuff' said!
Made a reservation for a brunch here with my fam. The food was just okay for me. A bit pricey but I have expected it. But definitely love the Frozen Hot Chocolate!!!
Very overrated place.. . Don't get me wrong the food is great, but $14 or was it $17 for chicken strips? COT DAMN sonnnn..... . Like their prices are super ridiculous. . . My friend got chicken and waffles and it had some potatoes but that meal was good too but $23 or somethin like that, and I bet Roscoe's is better and cheaper than this place. . . and I honestly don't get their whole "Frozen hot chocolate" shindig thing. like dude..... it's JUST a chocolate shake with a twist, no need to add the HOT part in it. hahah me and my friend were just rambling and saying how we dont get it...... no doubt its good but stop trying to make something that it's not. its not fucking hot. hahaha. But places like this that just lure people in for its reputation and overcharge people for very normal plates gets under my skin. sorry dont hate me!. . . . . ...their chicken strips didn't even come with fries -__________-
This is a review more on the management side of this restaurant.  We arrived at 4pm.  About 30% of Serendipity 3 was empty inside and out.   Great right?  No- they would not seat the 3 of us because "they did not have enough servers".  I asked could we just sit in one of the empty tables and wait, we could just wait with a glass of water.  They said "no, but you can sit at the bar".  OK- if you have ever seen Serendipity 3, does it make sense to have only 3 servers?  2 people were acting as Hostess.  Perhaps they could have thought, "Gee, we are understaffed, maybe a Hostess should become immediately a Waitress to cover the restaurant." Nope. And so we  crammed into the bar area while a bunch of tables were just left empty.  Nice. Now, let me say, the waitress we eventually had was very nice and the bartender was working hard.  BUT, the restaurant was not full and it took a LONG time to receive our ordered food.  4pm on the Vegas Strip, not 4AM!. . That being said, the food tasted good and the Frozen Hot Chocolate was a home run hit.  . . So park at the Caesar's parking lot, walk all the way through the casino, and good luck if you think you will be easily seated at Serendipity 3 when it is 30% empty.
