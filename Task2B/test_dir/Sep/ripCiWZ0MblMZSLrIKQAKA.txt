I enjoy the Casino at Monte Carlo, I haven't stayed at hotel but there lobby looks lovely. I have been to Vegas about 6 Times in the last two years and each time I return to Monte Carlo. Not sure if they have a members card.
Wave pool was the ONLY redeeming quality.. . Despite being a relatively newer building, we were amazed at how poorly maintained the rooms are (mold, paint peeling, loose caulking, etc)..  . But what really was an absolute rip off was the $22 per day "resort fee".   Here is what that unwarranted fee entails: "Fitness center access Internet access (may be limited) Newspaper Phone calls (may be limited) Faxes In-room coffee In-room bottled water Additional inclusions".. . Since we did not use any of those listed, we should not have been charged the ridiculous fee.. . Next time in Vegas we will be staying ANYWHERE else.
Very pleased with Monte Carlo.  The staff (valet, concierge, bell desk, front desk) were all friendly and helpful.  They went out of their way to ensure we had what we needed and knew where we were going.  For $75 we had a large strip view room with 2 double beds.  No fridge or microwave, but I'm sure upon request they can deliver them to the room.  The room was very clean upon arrival.  Checkout was extremely easy and I was able to do so on my phone.  I would have given them 5 stars, but to be fair, I only stayed one night and did not utilize housekeeping.  I cannot rate on the service other than upon arrival.  Free USA Today papers available at the elevator lobbies.  Monte Carlo has a free tram that goes to the Bellagio.  I was happy I see that as the water show and gardens at Bellagio are my favorite to see.  I will be returning to Monte Carlo!
I recently just stayed here from 8/28-8/30 and I hate I booked a room here.. . By the pictures I saw on the website I thought it was a nice hotel with a beautiful clean room! Annnnt WRONG!. 1. The carpet is filthy and disgusting. This carpet looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. You can literally seen the dirt on the carpet and spots.. 2. The bathroom floor was very nasty and dirty and so was the toilet. They switched our and room and the 2nd room was an F instead of an F-.. 3. The 2nd room carpet was just a filthy. I had to keep my shoes on and it really scared me to sleep in their beds. . 4. The tub was stopped up after I took a shower. They had to send someone up to run a snake to clear the drainage. . 5. The bell serviceman was HORRIBLE! When we arrived to check our luggage with the bell desk we were not greeted and the Bellman by the name of 'Warren" just stood there and then proceeded to help someone whom had just walked up after us. After standing there the female handler took our bags. Unfortunately we experienced the same treatment by "Warren" when we returned to get our bags. He totally ignored us and then told the other woman behind the desk that he was 'OFF'... Well he fooled us because a minute later he ask someone else did they need help who again came to the desk after us. And after all of that he had to bring our bags out because he apparently was the only handler there. He was very rude and for this Monte Carlo including your fake advertisement of a room I WILL NEVER stay at your hotel again! . . Please search yelp before booking with this hotel. I unfortunately did not and I did not enjoy my trip to LAS VEGAS because of this horrible dirty rude motel.
I stayed at the Monte Carlo Fri 8/22-Sun 8/24/14. I know it's not the nicest or newest place, but the price is right & it's in a good location on the Strip. I've stayed before with no issues, but after this last trip I will NEVER stay there again.. . I went to Vegas with my sister & one of my best girlfriends. We checked in late Friday night (11pm). We were in our room for about an hour so we could freshen up, regroup with friends & then we went downstairs to gamble & drink. We were out of our room for less than 4 hours. Somewhere in that time frame, all the cash we left in our purses in the room was stolen (a total of around $650). We noticed the next day when we woke up. . . We reported the theft to hotel management & security. We initially spoke to Ryan, position unknown, as he wasn't wearing a name tag. Ryan accessed their computer system which shows each time a door is opened by a guest or their staff. Long story short, the "system" shows that we did not close the door all the way when we left. There is no way this was possible. The door is so heavy it closes on its own. Their "system" also alerted them to this issue 10 mins after we left the room & security did nothing. Second manager named Celeste came over. They refused to comp our room and only offered a $100 credit towards food & drink. We demanded to move rooms and were told we were being upgraded to a suite. Upon entering the new room, we found it to be the same layout as our first room, just on a different floor. Julius, security personnel, wrote a report on a scratch piece of paper. My sister & I wrote statements. The police were never called. We were told this incident would be referred to Risk Management & they would follow up in 3-4 days after an "investigation". Over a week later and no word from the hotel. . . Upon my return back to work on Monday 8/25/14, my coworker asked about my trip. When I told her the story, she asked "Wait, where did you stay?" Turns out she stayed at the Monte Carlo in June with her sister & their boyfriends. Their boyfriends went to EDC & the girls didn't. My friend was sick & knocked out on cold medication, but her sister woke up in the middle of the night to find a man in their room. He said he was "security" and was checking a "report" of their door being left open. Super shady business going on at this place! . . DO NOT STAY HERE! If you must, use the safe AND deadbolt your door!! There are NO cameras in the hallway, so definitely stay at your own risk.
Stayed here bout a year ago for one night and finally writing a review on it.. The room was BASIC, I've stayed in nicer motel 6 hotels.. The front desk gave us the wrong key which was annoying. The casino was ok.. the Sushi resteraunt sucked. Don't waste your money here.
As it's my last day staying here I thought I'd share since the reviews seem shaky.  This place is beautiful and has a great location on the strip.  The room is actually a great size for a standard king bed room.  Clean and nice!
Ahh... breaking up is so very hard to do!  I'm starting to feel the depression kick in as I put pen to paper (ok, fingers to keyboard then) to write this less than stellar review for a place that's been like a home away from home for me the last 10 years or so.. . During my countless family trips to Vegas in the past decade, more often than not I've stayed at the Monte Carlo, and witnessed its sad, slow decline from a very decent establishment to something that's barely above motel status now.  I fear that this last stay may have sealed the deal once and for all and I'll need to look elsewhere next time.. . It is certainly one of the more affordable hotels on the strip and in recent years that's ultimately been the deciding factor for me and my family but it may no longer be enough.  Although there are many advantages to staying here, the ever-increasing disadvantages are beginning to tip the balance the other way:. . The location is ideal for me - the metro link to the City center and Bellagio in particular, is really handy.  I have also always enjoyed their brunch buffet.  I love the fact that the casino is a manageable size so it doesn't take you 17 hours to go from one end to the other; it also has a good selection of fast food places for when you want to grab a quick bite.  They have recently expanded the area leading to the trams to include another Starbucks (two within seconds of each other: major points scored!) as well as a crepe joint and a selection of other fun eating places.  And finally, with the exception of the bell-desk, customer service has always been friendly and professional, so all fine and dandy so far.... . Unfortunately the one area they need to pay attention to keeps getting neglected, deteriorating with every visit: the ROOMS.  In short: they are past their sell by date!  Everything about the rooms is old and getting older.  The carpet was absolutely horrendous this time - so filthy that I feared I'd catch a disease if I walked on it barefooted!  The towels on the other hand, are so worn and rough it's like drying yourself with a handful of nails.  I asked for fresh towels only to be given one that had not one but two giant stains on it - yuck.  The beds, which are actually quite comfortable, had sheets with holes in them.  The lamp on the bedside cabinet, usually bolted to its base had in fact been ripped off it, with the lampshade all beaten and battered.  The floorboards near the window were loose; the curtain rod actually came off its hook as I went to draw the curtains one night.  There's no Wi-Fi inside the rooms which in this day and age is quite unbelievable.  The ice machine was broken on my floor and two other consecutive floors.  And many other minor irritations that on their own may not be so bad - but when you have such a rich collection of inconveniences, it all adds up to an unhappy experience!  I understand a meaningful remodeling would be a huge undertaking, but surely just a bit of light maintenance would go a long way.. . I mentioned all of this during check-out and the lady I dealt with was apologetic and nice enough to reduce my bill by dropping the nightly resort fee - which let's face it, is just a b.s. charge that all hotels now tag on to your bill unnecessarily anyway, but it was better than nothing.. . So there you have it.  It's only owing to a heartbreaking sense of nostalgia that I'm rating this place 3 stars and not lower!
Came here with my boyfriend for my birthday and stayed in the Monaco suite. Very nice! I knocked off a star because there was no blow dryer in the bathroom. I usually don't bring my own blow dryer because there's no need to carry extra weight when they're already supposed to be in the room. I found that very odd for a hotel suite to not have one. Other than that, super fun place! We were out at the pool all day yesterday drinking, dancing and ignoring the lifeguards blowing their whistles at us every 5 seconds. Chill out, guys! :)
I love this place . I dont know , they have a specific aura ,and special weather there ... I was there 5 days , and we didnt get bored , we didnt go out even with my gf . It was amazing vacation. The river pool is fun and playing volleyball also was fun. . Casino is just like everywhere , dont play if u cant afford it .
Sometimes I run away to Vegas for a very last minute trip and need a hotel while I'm sitting at the airport. . . I decided to book a room at the Monte Carlos hours before I was set to arrive and was pleasantly surprised. The rate beat that of the rooms listed on the Hotel Tonight app and came with 2 free buffets. . . The room was pretty basic but clean and welcoming. I got a room with 2 queen beds even though it was only me and had a room facing the pool. The room didn't smell like smoke and the water pressure was fine. One of the elevators was out of order for my entire 3 night stay but I never had to wait long for a lift. All of the staff here were incredibly friendly. . . I checked out the pool one afternoon at about 2 pm. I inquired about renting a day bed and they said it was $200 for the bed but that $200 was but towards food and drink. Since it was just me for the afternoon that was a little more than I wanted to spend and declined. The guy said that they usually dropped prices at 3pm and since they had 2 day beds sitting open he would drop it down to $150 for me right then. I thought about it but still declined. He told me he could do it for $100. Sold! I got a day bed all to myself for a food and beverage credit of $100 which was easy to meet. The pool was awesome- not too many kids, not too many bros and not annoyingly loud. I also got a free tube for the lazy river and floated around a bit. I might come back to this hotel just for the day bed. . . The other great perk about this place is the Blue Man Group parade that winds through the casino. It's a great way to spend about 10-15 minutes if you catch the end of the parade near the opening of the Blue Man Group Theater. . . All and all this hotel is great if you are balling on a budget!
Horrible experience will never stay in this hotel again in my life, the room was really small and the furniture looked really old, very depressing.
We got the spa suite, no complaints. I love the medium sized refrigerator, no microwave though.
Came here with my best friends for a ladies weekend!  This hotel wasn't the fanciest hotel I've ever stayed at on the strip. But for the money ($240 for 3 nights in a high floor room) it was was what I would expect. The beds and pillows were clean and comfy. The shower worked. It was a basic run of the mill shower. The only thing I wish they had was a little fridge. But it's ok. We stopped the sink and filled it with ice as a make shift cooler. I didn't mind it. Honestly, if you are looking for a great location on a budget this place is fine. I liked the pool just fine. The wave pool was my favorite. I also liked the food court. The check in / check out process was painless (granted we did check out at 4:30am....) any questions I had about my bill they helped me figure out and the staff was great. I would have given 5 stars except the room was just ok. The shower was just ok. The room keeping lady seemed fine. The lady came to our room and asked if we needed service. We said no and she went away. As soon as we left (all but 1 of the girls left) she came back into the room. We thought that was odd. And thank god a girl stayed behind to nap other wise we wouldn't have known she came back into the room. Why would she come back immediately after we left? after we said the room was fine? I don't know. But other than that strange happening everything was fine. No secret charges. Nothing.
There are plenty of hotel/resorts to stay at on the Las Vegas Strip... Monte Carlo is in the top running for one of the best places to stay on the CHEAP.. . The rooms are normal, slightly dated. Nothing fancy yet you also don't feel like you're at a cheap motel. . . One of the best parts of this hotel is the pool area. Various pools, spas, and a lazy river! Plus, you don't have to wait ridiculous lines or have a promoter get you in. It's a low key yet still a fun pool... perfect to spend a hot Vegas day.. . Perks. Pool area. Free WiFi. Normal rooms. . . Overall, if you are in need of a place on the strip to stay for minimal $, Monte Carlo will not disappoint.
Bed bugs??? . . I don't know if our bed had them but I came home with red marks on the left side of my stomach and back. (I'm a side sleeper) room # 09-118. . There's nothing special about this place except that it's cheaper than other big casinos. It really feels dated compared to the newer high end resorts now.
Awwww, this is the way Vegas was meant to be....not too pretentious, but still a little bit of everything.
My fiance and I are coming to the end of a seven day, six night stay. We have enjoyed our time here. It's true that the hotel could be updated a bit more, but the customer service is excellent, friendly and knowledgeable. there are a variety of eating options and we've tried almost all the restaurants. They have some great happy hours with delicious food at Brand and Andre's.  We were on the 23rd floor with a nice view, away from the construction, non-smoking, and away from the elevator (which we love as there wasn't much noise).  One big con for me is that there is no free wifi throughout the hotel--I think that could be changed pretty easily. Everything i have seen (our room, common areas) is clean and simple. It's true that it isn't a higher end hotel, but it was just fine for us. I would think about how much time you will spend in the room. We also liked the free tram between Monte Carlo and Bellagio--very useful, especially when your feet are tired!
What happened to this Hotel   It was at one time our go to.   Checked in yesterday. First impression hallway needs a redo carpet stained,,  torn, tattered, walls down hallway badly marked up and most pictures that used to line halls are gone.  Just random picture hooks left in walls.     Room not any better than halls. Do not even want to sit in these stained chairs.    Resort fee includesWi-Fi, coffee and two bottles of water.    Wi-Fi not wireless   really!!!!   There were two packets of coffee and two bottles of water in our room...problem is only one paper cup and no sugar or creamer.  If you are going to say the resort fee covers amenities   than provide them.  Oh and there is a serious, trip and fall hazard just waiting to happen in the hallway    You may want to take care of this.....Please let us know when you have remodeled will not be back until then.
Stayed at the Monte Carlo two weekends ago and had a blast! The lobby is beautiful and the rooms were clean! The staff was great and very helpful.  We got discounted tickets to the Blue Man Group for staying at the hotel. The show was great! They have everything inside the Monte Carlo!  Great hotel! Too bad it rained while we were there. We didn't get a chance to check out the pool. Next time...
My bf and I decided to stay here because it was cheaper then other hotels. When we get there to check in, the king bed and strip view we paid for wasn't available and so they set us up in another room that had a king bed with no view, but would refund our $ we paid extra for the view back. We get to the room and this room was for someone who was handicap. Nothing against that, but the shower was different and felt like we were at a motel. So we called to asked to be moved to a different room. A dif lady at the front checked n told us a king bed just became avail. We said great well take it! Went to check in our room and it was a double queen bed. Wth. Called the front desk a guy picked up n said they didn't have a king avail n that they'll switch our room first thing when its avail the next day. Next day came we got a text saying our king bed room was avail. We go n check in and guess what? Double queen beds again! We were so furious had to call again and complain n they finally got us our room and told us they will deduct $50 from our bill. So the Last night we were there I was thirsty so decided to get soda from their vending machine. Didn't take cash so I charged it on my cc. First time it didn't seem to take my card so I swiped again. Machine said authorizing then said vending as if the soda was goin to come out. Waited a good 1-2 min. Nothing came out. Checked my bank statement n it charged me twice! Waited another min. Nothing had to call front desk and lady told me I had to go down to the front desk to talk to a supervisor. Oh man by this time I wanted to kill someone! The supervisor was nice enough to refund my $ back. This whole experience was just a living hell for my bf n I and I would never or even recommend this hotel to anyone. It's old, dirty, smells, and have mold stains in the showers.
The best part about this hotel was the staff they were so accommodating and friendly. Very disappointed in the rooms, ripped bedding , broken lamp shades, old tubs, caulking falling out around tub, no chairs on room, beds old . Needless too say won't be coming back till they decide to renovate.
I'm really shocked that after complaining multiple times due to a domestic dispute in the room next door, that started at 3am, that the hotel manager would not comp us the last nights stay, that pushed us to check out early!!!! . . That's flippin ridiculous! I would never stay at this hotel again due to the service provided at the end of our stay... They even billed us wrong!!!! Had to review the rate with them since we paid in full at check in...
Perfect middle of the road place to stay and gamble in Vegas.  Clean rooms.  The crowd at the pool and in the casino is a little of everything and not a lot of the worst.
Just stayed here over the past weekend as a bit of a late celebration for my birthday and wanted to find a hotel on the Strip that wouldn't break the bank but was somewhat central to everything.  This hotel certainly fit the bill as I managed what I thought was a pretty good deal and it included a $75 food and beverage credit for use at The Pub, one of many restaurants on site.  We arrived at about 5 PM or so on Friday night and were met with a long check in line, but with a full staff working the counters, the line moved quickly and in short order we were checked in and ready to settle into our room.  As far as hotel rooms go, there is nothing special about it as it's your standard run of the mill room, though it was a nice size at least.  We noticed an off odor coming from the bathroom which we got rid of by keeping the plunger on the sink closed and thus decided not to complain since it turned out to be a minor inconvenience but worth points being docked off my review.  What kept this review from being a 3 star review was the great selection of restaurants on site (11 total and a food court with a few different options),the Monte Carlo has something for pretty much every taste and budget from budget friendly (food court) to the high end of things (Andre's and Brand Steakhouse).  Like most of the bigger Vegas hotels/resorts, pretty much everything you need is under one roof so you don't need to go anywhere else.. . Pros:. . Inexpensive. . Great selection of restauarants. . Clean, well kept casino. . Ease of navigating around hotel premises. . Cons:. . Odor from bathroom. . Housekeeping didn't clean the room the second day we were there even though we asked
Wtf??? No wifi - are you f'ng kidding me? What year is it?  1994 ? I cannot believe a hotel and casino if this size would not have wifi in the room? Every f'ng McDonalds and Starbucks has wifi - give me a break - and no one ever tells you until you ask the bell man how to connect? This is crazy!!!!!
Horrible rooms. This hotel is badly in need of a remodel. The bathrooms are awful! There is no cable tv. Don't stay here. And they don't have wifi. I hope you have an adapter for the old school modem cable. Even if you get a discount because there's a seminar being held here, don't stay here.
