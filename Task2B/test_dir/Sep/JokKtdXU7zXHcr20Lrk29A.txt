I LOVE Four Peaks. . Kiltlifter and IPA are my faves. . Beer battered chicken fingers are a close second.. Food portions are huge so order sparingly.. Always have the best time here =]
This place gets my definite approval! I found it on yelp simply by searching for a place between Mesa and Phoenix. They had a ton of great reviews and I love to try new places, also the menu has something for everyone. I wasn't sure which drink (I was eyeing the peach, but wasn't sure) to try and the waitress said I could have a sample...needless to say LOVED IT! We ordered our food and before I thought about it again, it was being put on our table. Fast indeed. I will be coming again next time I'm up that way. Also the fries are bomb!
They are famous for their beer, of course, but they actually have great food too, including vegetarian-friendly food. I especially like the veggie burger and their pizza.  All of their appetizers are great too.  Minus one star because it's often hard to hear your dining companions here-- you may have to shout just to carry a conversation.
I'm all about good beer on tap so I love stopping by different breweries in the area. I finally got over to Four Peaks to catch up with a friend and have been wanting to go back since! Good food, good beer, great music, awesome service. The only downside is that the parking sucks---we parked quite walk down the street because there was nothing close available (and this was a Wednesday afternoon). That being said, park far away and burn off of those extra calories so you don't feel guilty about all of those beers that you're about to drink (:
As far as airport dining goes, Four Peaks Brewing Co fits the bill.  The service is fast and friendly.  The food is better than what you would expect while rushing through to your next flight.  The best thing about this place is there are tons of TVs so we were able to catch a couple of the NFL games while our flight was delayed.  . . I had the beer battered chicken fingers and French fries.  The chicken was very moist.  The breading...it was good but well there was A LOT of it.  I picked some of it off and they were fine.  The French fries were really good and had a really great seasoning on them.  I also tried my husband's chicken roll and it was pretty good but a little greasy.  . . Totally would visit again the next time I have a layover in Phoenix.
This place is fun, has a fantastic beer selection and is ideal for group gatherings. If you're a football fan - hit the Sunday morning brunch and watch the game. The food has been outstanding each time we've come. The service is great.. . A solid 5 stars!
Yummy yummy yummy!!!! My husband loves the beer, I can't drink no more:( baby on the way!:D . The food is fabulous! I love the salmon BLT my favorite! . Good service, the bar tenders are always friendly. Beware it's always packed weekend nights:O jeje I guess that's good tho:p I love the patio area too!. Keep it up guys!;)
This is the place to be for great beer and food. The atmosphere is always lively and I've always had good service regardless of party size. First timers, make sure to try Four Peak's famous Kilt Lifter beer. I'm personally a huge fan of Sunbru and Peach Ale. In terms of food, the chicken strips are delicious. The four peaks menu also includes beer recommendations based on your order. Parking is a little bit challenging, but there is always space if you're willing to walk a little bit. The four peaks parking lot is small, but you can park in the alley in the back of the brewery or along 8th street. Definitely a place I'd recommend visiting if you're visiting Tempe and looking for some good brews.
I've been here twice now, once at their Scottsdale location and now their Tempe location. Although, it can get a little hot and humid at the Tempe location, I like it better, but I have had a great experience both times. Ihighly recommend the Salmon BLT. It's delicious! And if you like IPAs, I'd go with the 'Raj'.
Okay so here I am writing a review about some place that I went on Friday, September 12.  I went to the Tempe location with some friends from Shutterfly. The parking is horrible as you can't find anything unless you want to walk three blocks away, they need to fix that but I got lucky I found a very very close parking space I parked I walked I had a cold beer had a good time with my friends from Shutterfly maybe somebody could rent a lot somewhere around there get a bus and charge to park there have a bus take you to Four Peaks have fun then when ready to leave, have bus take you back to car. Wow what a concept college kids are they not thinking. . Enough about the parking issue. Moving on now. But while I was there and I had the peach beer it was awesome the fish and chips was off the charts and you are probably wondering if I will go back  - Yes of course!
The pumpkin porter is AMAZING!!!!  . . I don't really care for their food.  But every year we live at this bar for a month.. . As far as the other beers, I wish they had more dark choices.
I would give it 5 starts but it can be quite "Bro'd out", for lack of a better term, at times. Good beer and good food though!
I think their beer is overrated, but if you show up not expecting amazing food or the best ale ever, then the visit will be alright if not memorable.  When I'm in San Diego, the Sculpin DOES taste like the best IPA I've ever had (98 at Beer Advocate), and when I'm in Michigan, the Two-Hearted Ale DOES taste like the best IPA I've ever had (95 at Beer Advocate).  So when I have the Raj IPA at Four Peaks, and I'm less than enthusiastic (due to all the build up of how great it is), it is not a surprise that Beer Advocate rates it an 84------pretty respectable, but let's keep things in perspective, okay?
This was my first visit here after recently moving to the Phoenix area this summer.  After living in CA, I have become accustomed to the being able to pop in local breweries for a beer and a bite...particularly in the San Diego area (incredible selection there, Stone is my favorite).  I really am trying to get into my local beers.  I enjoyed the Hope Knot IPA, so my wife surprised me for a lunch date at Four Peaks!  . . The place was a little less polished than I imaged it would be, sort of a sports bar feel.  The food seletion looked good, typcial bar fare combined with some very unique selections.  We only order some pretzels...and I ordered the taster set so that I could explore their full line of beers.  The beer was good overall, not the best I have had.  I still think the Hop Knot is one of their best, and their ales are strong as well.  . . The best thing about this place was the incredible service.  Despite the super casual feel, the service was fantastic.  Our server covered every detail, offered wonderful suggestions and check on us often.  When I asked about the building and beer production, she fetched the manager (Mike), who was very gracious to take the time to tell us more about the brewery (the building dates back to the 19th century!).  . . Very much enjoyed our lunch, I would come back with some of my buddies for a beer anytime.
Great beer, great food & great service!  One of my favorite spots to eat in Tempe.  Absolutely love the Salmon BLT!  Service and food are always spot on and always served up quickly.
We came here on a Saturday night and it was PACKED. Fortunately, we didn't have to wait for a table, however, we chose first available. We didn't think it was terribly hot that evening, so I said okay to a table on the patio. Well, it was really hot at our table. They had a few fans, however, we were in a dead zone. No air. A table opened up not too long after we sat that was in front of their giant fan, so it was great.. . THE BEERS:. Sunbru: Kolsch Style Ale. Hop Knot IPA. RAJ IPA. Kilt Lifter: Scottish-Style Ale. Peach Ale. 8th Street Pale Ale. Hefeweizen. Oatmeal Stout. . Ruben ordered the Sample Tray that featured all eight of their beers for just $10. Great deal. Ruben's favorite of the bunch was the Kilt Lifter. I went with one of their Summer Shandys, the Sippy Sippy with Four Peaks Peach Ale, Tito's Vodka, blood orange liqueur, and lemonade. It was all right.. . I was really impressed with the food! Ruben and I shared the Arizona Chicken Rolls ($8) stuffed with grilled chicken, Anaheim chiles and two cheeses and served with sweet jalapeno dressing. The rolls are HUGE and packed with chicken. Great flavors too. However, I thought the dressing was gross.. . I had the 8th Street Ale Chicken Strips ($10). The chicken breast is battered with their pale ale creating a really flavorful and crispy exterior. This is also the same batter used on their fries and they were so delicious. The dish is served with a flavorful chipotle ranch that went well with the chicken and fries.. . Ruben selected the Popper Burger ($11.50) that was topped with roasted jalapeno, onion straws, and cream cheese. It was good, but not my kind of burger. My mom enjoyed the Pub Fish and Chips ($11). Alaskan Cod is battered with the Kilt Lifter and served with homemade tartar sauce. The fish was really nice.. . Service was pleasant and it's a chill place to hang out with your friends. Prices are decent. A solid place to get locally-brewed beer and good bar eats.
I loved the service, the environment was the best and the ppl at the entrance were super nice. The food was good but I don't suggest the salad, the cheese was gross and it was a very boring spinach salad. Next time we'll probably split a meal and go for the beer. I really love four peaks so it was awesome!
Love this place, the food is great and the beer is cold and delicious. I recommend dessert and the cask when they have it. Service is great, the place is clean and it's always nice on their patio when it isn't a million degrees outside!
Four Peaks is a great place to enjoy good food and beer.  The beer is always cold and the food is always warm.  I would recommend getting the sampler the first time visiting so you can figure out your favorite brew.
I've been here twice and this place is awesome! The first time I went it was very packed for the USA World Cup game. I split the pretzel appetizers, which came with phenomenal mustard. The pretzels were massive and really buttery, soft, and great. I shared the Tap Room Tenderloin and ordered it with Chipotle sauce. It was cooked perfectly and the chipotle really enhanced the flavors. Would definitely recommend. Shared a pitcher of Sunbru which was really great and refreshing on a hot summer day. The second time I went with family from New Jersey who are quite picky folks. They had just gotten in from a long flight and were starved. They were SUPER impressed with the beers, both of my parents ordered flights and loved all. As for appetizers- we ordered the buffalo wings, which to our pleasant surprise were way spicier than expected, the spinach artichoke dip, which was filled with way more flavor than I had ever had, the Thai Hummus, which was superb, and a shrimp/goat cheese bruchetta. Every single item that touched my Sunbru cleansed palette was amazing. Not one thing was bland, they were all kicked with amazing flavors and combinations I could never replicate. Can't wait to keep trying the great things on the menu!
This isn't your average local brewery. These guys take their job seriously. From the brewing of the beer to the menu creation and preparation, Four Peaks is the model of local brew-pub success! My family loves this place!
This place is amazing. From delicious beer to amazing food this is the best brewery I've been to. Mike the manager took great care of us. He made sure that our experience was perfect. Try the spinach artichoke dip
