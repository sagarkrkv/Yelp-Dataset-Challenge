We booked only for one night for labor day weekend and due to the fact that their rooms are suites. I didn't get a discount because of the holiday but i did get an upgrade from a luxury suite to a Bella suite due to our room unavailability. The upgrade was a plus as well as valet service.The room itself was a different story,i found a stranger belongings and food which dated back to JULY(based on their check in receipt)inside the bedside drawer and dirty socks on the floor!i requested extra towels and a cork opener but didn't get it till after 30 mins.we figured the room wasn't thoroughly clean and didn't touch anything else other than the bed.for a 5 diamond hotel i was expecting a little bit more of excellent cleanliness service.the pools are pretty small and crowded so we only stayed for 30 mins.i agree that the room was pretty spacious and i did get a free upgrade but for cleanliness and housekeeping services i give this one an F and as much as i like the spacious room I'm not coming back and unless they offer free continental breakfast then maybe ill reconsider.i can get a better and bigger room for the price that they gave me on the strip and those would have probably made me happier and contented.but thanks palazzo for the one night and the extra deposit you requested for reasons you can't give to me.
Stayed at this hotel when my family and I were in Vegas. The suite was so nice and clean! I especially loved the bathroom! The bathroom was all marble and the size of my bedroom back home. We ate at one of the restaurants downstairs on our 1st night there. The casino was big and clean - I enjoyed playing the slots and roulette. I would definitely come back and stay here next time I'm in Vegas.
Best hotel I have ever stayed in Strip. The room was big and there were few steps of stairs between the bedroom and living room. I really enjoyed my stay here!
I checked in at my Favorite Hotel . It's  5 star rating by my standard. However, with the front desk customer service Allison .. I'd add another 1 star for for outstanding service .. Soon as I approach the counter . She greeted the us.. 1 check !! I told her if I could upgrade to a 2 Queen Bed instead of king .. She politely said yes we could but need to pay to difference 2 check .. After I told her about Mom and requested a room close to the elevator.. She said Yes!!! With a smile .. She even ask me if we need assistance ..  There goes the personal touch .True to what she promised.. Our room was on the 30th  room 802 .... Mom was very very happy since she's a slow walker.. Our room was the first room from the lift..I insisted that I speak to her Manager for me to compliment her.. She's an good example for customer service that goes beyond .. Bravo to Allison .. And Bravo to The Palazzo my Home in Las Vegas .. One last thing.. True to my upbringing id ask politely to the people you encounter they'll give you the same treatment or even More..To ALLISON the front desk .. More power to you
Underwhelming experience.  One of the worst meals of our life at Morels - the hotel manager could care less and told us the restaurants are under separate management and so not her problem.  As patrons of the Bellagio, we were excited about Palazzo - however the horrendous meal at Morels will keep us away forever.
Horrible hotel experience!  If I could give them zero stars I would. My friends and I stayed here for a friend's birthday weekend. We parked in Valet for ease and convenience. After hitting the club, we went back to our hotel to crash and we discovered the pipes below the sink were leaking. We called for additional blankets and somebody to come check the sink. Even with the obvious water drops on the floor and on the leaky pipes, they said it wasn't broken and if it continues to call them back. No option to move to a different room. It took 3 calls to get an extra blanket. They apparently sent an extra blanket to the incorrect room. . . We were barely asleep for an hour or two when at 5:00am we got a call from the hotel saying our car was broken into in the valet parking lot.  Apparently someone broke into 7 other guys that night. We spent 3 hours with security and our next day was ruined. We got back to our room at 8am and had to sleep in. We had plans to go to a dayclub followed by a buffet and then a nightclub. We only had time for a nightclub because we didn't sleep all night. We went to complain to a the guest services manager Patrick who did not seem to care. All we got were "sorry", "shit happens", and "there's nothing we can do".   He even went to say that valet was a"locked area".  However, my other friend parked right across from valet in the self park area and there's only a covered fence with a gate. The gate stayed open the entire time we were there.  The gate is not locked or even closed, anybody can walk to the valet area. I wish I had taken a picture of it to show how easy it is to get to our car that was broken into. When we complained about the pipes, he said I'm sorry. He didn't follow up with the leaky sink at all. I have to say, for an upscale hotel, they have the worst customer service. Never going back to this hotel. Worst hotel ever.
Still one of my favorite resorts to stay at when in Vegas. Rooms are always spacious and plenty of restaurants and stores within walking distance.  Standard suites come with either king sized bed (luxury suite) or two queen beds (Bella suite) with pull-out couch. I've also stayed at their hospitality suites which come with a patio area. . . Hungry? You have two Grand Luxe Cafes to choose from, Lavo Italian, or The Cut steakhouse if you're feeling fancy. Thirsty? Grab a drink at he many bars, pick up a coffee at The Coffee Bean, or detox from last night's binge drinking with some juice at Juice Bar. These are all just to name a few. . . I am overall well-rested and happy with each stay at The Palazzo.
Best Place to stay in Vegas. I love how big the rooms are and the decor. I wish a hotel room was my bedroom! Great access to the strip too.
Just spent 3 nights here. I usually stay at Aria or MO, but it was comped... so why not. Check-in was a breeze. The rooms are similar in style to Venetian, but not really a fan. The bed was extremely creaky (good thing I wasn't banging a showgirl... as I normally am). Small tub. I'm going to assume we were given one of the older rooms since they didn't give us a sunken living room. Looks much nicer on their site. Still.. wasn't bad.. . The one big plus for Palazzo is the layout of the resort. Everything is where it should be. Want to go to the fitness center? It's underground (unlike Aria... where you walk through a common area to get to the spa) and there are two gyms - a small one at Palazzo and a bigger one at Venetian... also underground; they're connected). Valet drop-off is on the main level. Valet pick-up is downstairs. It's a short walk to Wynn, Palazzo stores like Barney's, and restaurant row/Grand Canal at Venetian. . . It's ok. I'd stay here if the room was free, but I still prefer Aria.
