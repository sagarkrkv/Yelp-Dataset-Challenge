SO GOOD! I feel like this is a must go place whenever you're in Vegas! It's so worth it! The bread is so yummy! This is located in PH and there is usually a long line but it goes by pretty fast. I want to go back to Vegas now...as I am writing this review. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! I'm hungry!
This place is a MUST-EAT when you are in Vegas. If you don't get Earl's, your Vegas trip is NOT COMPLETE!!. . I find comfort in their Tomato Soup, whether or not you're hungover or sad that you've lost money. The sour and creamy Tomato Soup will be the best pick-me-up! . . Chipotle Chicken Avocado. Chipotle Chicken Avocado. Chipotle Chicken Avocado. Say it a few more times so you will remember to get Chipotle Chicken Avocado. If you are a fan of avocado, this is the sandwich for you. The savory chipotle sauce goes perfectly well with avocado and diced chicken breast. I can devour the entire thing in less than 5 minutes, not even kidding. Then after that, I would go get another one for the long road back home. Ahh okay now I want to go back to Vegas just to get some more!
Delicious! . . The line is very long but they hand you a flashing waiting device which has a 100 meter range. . . I love the Hawaiian BBQ with its ham and chicken combination and the slightly sweet touch of the pineapples. I also really adore the Original sandwich with its roast beef and the slightly sweet spread. The sandwiches have the perfect combination of flavor and crispy texture from the toasted bread. . . The size is also well-portioned. The sandwich is cut in half and I have found that only eating half is the perfect size for a snack, while finishing the whole sandwich is the perfect size for a meal.
It's a tasty sandwich with a loooooong line. And you might have to eat it while standing in a casino. But it's also a cheap lunch option on the strip, so, meh, I guess it's alright.
Was here Saturday morning and the bacon, egg & cheese is the way to go. Great picker upper & great $. Be prepare to stand in line.
I've never had a roast beef sandwich before. The Original 1762 was simply delicious!
Winner winner Tuna melt sammich. They use albacore white, Swiss cheese on a soft heated bun.  It was Earlicius!!! Sorry no pics, scarfed that bad boy down.  It was also a really good portion, not gijimbo just right.
Delicious Sandwiches fast!  This place is a well oiled machine.  If the line looks long don't worry, it goes fast!. . The food is a great deal, everything is under $10 but taste like it should be twice the cost.  I had the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich and a brownie.  Very tasty.  I would like to have tried everything on the menu.. . Definitely check this place out if you are in the Miracle Mile shops!
Cheapest go to spot for your source of hangover food!  . . I admit I use to go to this place a lot because it was probably the most affordable place on the strip to eat at. However, this place is old news for me now since I have the luxury of eating it at Downtown Disney now!   . . Food: I usually opt for the original sandwich or the full montagu. However, I personally prefer the original ! In addition to the sandwiches, I also enjoy eating their clam chowder here, because it definitely hits the spot after a crazy night of partying. . . Service: The line is always long during the daytime, I feel like this place needs to learn how to be more efficient about this aspect of the business. But then again it may not be their fault, because everyone and their friends keep cutting the line! . . Final Verdict: Love the sandwiches and soup, but I would probably only come back here if I was traveling on a budget.
Always pretty good. Depending on location, comps can be used. Tasty. Fast. A little pricey but again, comps can be used. Have only tried the sandwiches although they offer other items. Friendly. The only issues I've ever had here are with other customers. The clientele can sometimes be very rude, drunk, and/or lost. Not sure how the employees put up with them so much.
Sandwiches here are awesome and the price is very reasonable. Sandwiches are about 6 inches, all the sandwiches are great but my favorite was the roast beef. Make sure you get someone to get a table while you order, cause it does get packed. Another bonus, it is open 24 hours.
Interesting history.  Sandwich was definitely good but I think I enjoyed the sandwich for the history behind its establishment.  The real Earl of Sandwich does not have any secret recipes passed down through generations and the original sandwich shop did not exist for 300 years. But it's still interesting to know that the current Earl of Sandwich decided to make money off of the creation of his ancestors.
Meh, don't know what all the fuss is about. I'm from Michigan where we have something similar called Potbellys. Hot and cold sandwiches on a toasted bun. The soups suck, don't waste your money.
6.49$ Sandwiches? nomnomnom. . I had the Full Montagu which was delicious. Love their soups too! Everything on their menu is great and it's simple and easy. Their lines are long so be prepared to wait.
Earl of Sandwich is Las Vegas perfection. No trip is complete without at least one stop here. It's open 24 hours, very affordable, centrally located, and DELICIOUS whether you're sober or drunk. Seating area isn't that big; maybe my friends and I are just lucky but we always find a table no matter what time we go, even when things seem busy.. . A bonus is that it's across the way from some bar in the Miracle Shops that plays really good hip hop and R&B music (at least on the Friday night we went).
I've always loved the Earl of Sandwich in Downtown Disney. So imagine my face when I found this location is only a walkway away from where we were staying. Tears of happiness, guys. Real tears.. . In all seriousness, Earl of Sandwich, located inside Planet Hollywood near PBR Rock Bar & Grill, catered to me and my cousins' both drunk and sober needs -- and for the inexpensive price of $6.49 (as of Sept. 7, 2014), might I add.. . My "gold bars" from my last few visits include Avocado BLT and the Holiday Turkey.. . The Avocado BLT is packed with a ton of itty bitty bits of bacon and a generous serving of avocado. With the toasted, crunchy bread and my addition of some Grey Poupon... ugh. Just writing about it makes my stomach grumble.. . The Holiday Turkey sandwich has the fixits of a leftover sandwich the day after Thanksgiving. The sandwich includes slices of turkey, mayo, stuffing and cranberry sauce. REALLY delicious! This sandwich is the epitome of filling your drunchies.. . I also managed to grab a side of their potato salad. It wasn't that great; it tasted what you'd expect in a potato salad. However, the portion is small for the price you're paying, so don't bother.. . The staff here are a hit or miss. Most of them are friendly, but during one of our visits, the lady taking our sandwich order literally didn't say a word. I told her my sandwich, and before I could ask for a side, she prints out my order receipt and took the next customer. Uh, okay.. . All in all, Earl of Sandwich delivers a bang for your buck. Huge props for keeping this place open 24 hours. If you need a bite and you're near Planet Hollywood, definitely give this place a try.
After 4 days of either crap expensive food or expensive just barely edible food Yelp reviews led me to the Earl of Sandwich.   Worth the walk to get here.  Excellent breakfast sandwich and just because I walked all the way there to get breakfast I had to try one of the signature Earl of Club sandwiches.   Even full from breakfast this sandwich was excellent too!  I'll stay at a hotel closer to this place next Vegas trip. Oh and did I mention they do NOT accept tips.  Nice!  The prices are great too!
Holy mother of sandwich, this place is so good. I missed it the year in between my trips to Vegas. Sober or tipsy, my reaction to this food is the same: 100% necessity. Ate three sandwiches in a three day trip to Vegas. Yeah, it's that good.  I tried the tomato soup on my last day, my only regret is not getting it on the first day so I could enjoy dipping ALL of my sandwiches in it. If you're going to Vegas or already here stumbling down the strip looking up places to eat on your phone. Put earl of sandwich on your map and cab over!
I knew something was off about this location. :| Came on a Saturday evening to grab dinner and of course there's a line. We wait diligently as like the other 30-40 people in line. Out of nowhere two gargantuan couple comes waltzing in front of me and orders. Literally cuts the line and the cashier doesn't say anything. This happens again when my boyfriend and his group of friends was up when three other guys comes up to them, tries to use a "Have you seen my phone" ruse to cut in line. The cashier once again can see that the three guys were not there beforehand, yet decides to stay silent. Thank goodness the group decides to walk around them to order.. . What pissed me off was we tried telling management about it, it's not fair to all the other people waiting in line. The response they gave: they merely shrugged their shoulders and said "okay". #WTF. They could've at least put line cutters on last or something. They didn't even seem to care that it was bothering other customers.. . Not to mention their service is terribly slow. We watched the only sandwich cutter take his sweet time cutting the sandwiches as other sandwiches piled up in the oven (since it's on a conveyor belt). It ended up being burnt. -_-. . If it wasn't for the fact that this was the closet place to cheap eats near Vdara, probably wouldn't come here again.
The sandwiches here are very tasty but they have messed my order up a few times I have been here which is frustrating! If they had better service I would definetly give them more stars.
This place was just ok... It was not worth the wait in the long line.
Excellent, no nonsense, cheap breakfast and lunch food.  Earl of Sandwich is very reminiscent of a Panera Bread style lunch bistro, with amazing prices for the strip.  My girlfriend and I each had a sandwich, bottle of water, chips, and shared a macncheese for under 25$.  Average sandwich price is around 7 bucks.  All sandwiches and wraps are around 6" in size.
In my view, yet another overhyped restaurant. Earl of Sandwich is a glorified Subway. . . The Food: The chips are greasy and not particularly special. The chicken tortilla soup is pretty standard, the kind of soup you'd expect at your local Panera Bread. The chicken mac'n'cheese was actually quite delicious, with a crunchy texture owing to the crumbs they throw on top (mmm mmm mmmm). And the sandwich itself? Nothing special. I got the chipotle avocado chicken sandwich: The bread was whatever-white-bread, the chicken seemed ok, but not explosive, and the big chunks of avocado were pretty good and fresh. . . Price: Dirt cheap. Under $7 for a sandwich. I understand for the price it may be decent enough. But this is not nearly as good as Ike's in San Francisco. . . Overall, this may be a good place to check out if you and the squad are nursing a hangover on a Sunday morning, but I wouldn't go here otherwise. Also, the lines can apparently get pretty huge.. . In the near future, I expect this place to explode into a national chain, losing whatever little cache it had in Vegas as a stop-over spot for hungover peeps.
The tuna melt should be on everyones bucket list.  Salads are great and prices reasonable.  Very good service
We always stop here when we go to Vegas.  This is one of the best priced restaurants on the strip.  The food is good however depending upon what time you go there is a wait.  My husband was a bit disappointed in the breakfast sandwich, he felt it was to small but tasted good.  I got the chipotle avocado chicken sandwich and it was good as usual.  Will return next year when we take our yearly trip to Vegas!
Disappointed in this sandwich bar.  I had a salad which was ok - nothing to brag about.  I was disappointedthat the menu only had hot subs - no cold sandwiches.
This used to be my favorite place to go in Vegas. In fact, I would have rated it 5 stars just a year ago. However, the quality of the food has really gone downhill since then. . . I was here just a week ago, excited as usual to get my yummy tuna melt and holiday turkey sandwich to share with my sister. I noticed something as soon as I got the sandwiches, they were much smaller than usual. I have been to Earl's more times than I can count. I've been to both this location and the one in Downtown Disney. So I knew for sure that something was off. I just thought to myself "That's alright I guess, I don't need to be eating so much". Then I noticed that the sandwiches were barely toasted, in fact, the holiday turkey was almost white in color. What the hell? I took a bite of the tuna melt first. It was decent, but nowhere near as good as it used to be. There was definitely less cheese and it seemed drier than I remembered. The contents of the holiday turkey was still pretty good, but the bread just wasn't toasted enough. . . I'm just really sad that the quality of their product has gone down so much. I feel like whoever is higher up needs to realize that they are ruining their brand image by sacrificing the quality of their product for larger profit margins. Not sure if I really want to come back to this location unless there's a change.
We stayed at PH and found this little gem of a sandwich shop! They are open 24/7. So good!!! Especially the Holiday Turkey sandwich. My only complaint, there isn't a shop in San Diego.
Yummy yummy sandwich in my tummy. . . Sucks when there is a line but it may be worth the wait. BLT hearty with bacon. . . Chipotle was good too but not my fav. . . Salads are good! Had the baja chicken I think. . . Always crave earls when I'm in Vegas
I met friends here for breakfast before a desert excursion.  My friends eat here when they stay at Planet Hollywood and like the taste and cost of their breakfast sandwiches.  . . Metting at 7 AM, there were only a few people at the restaurant.  I ordered their bacon, egg, and cheddar sandwich and a coffee.  In a few minutes, the buzzer went off and we picked up our sandwiches.  . . The sandwich was good.  There was a lot of bacon, the egg was good, but I didn't taste cheddar.  The coffee was very good and we each took a refill for the road.  . . For a quick breakfast sandwich when you're in the PH area, I'd recommend this place.
consistently perfect tuna melts. one of my favorite sandwich places ever.
I don't get what the hype is about this place don't get me wrong my sandwich was good, but it was just that. It was nothing special and I would not come back here or recommend it to anyone. I tried the full montagu and it was alright. I stole a few bites from the tuna melt (decent) and the original (pretty good) but the only lasting impression is their mustard spread and horseradish sauce. The tomato soup tastes like it was warmed up from a can. Also, my sister was in the mood for something simple and got the grilled cheese, it was like a roll of bread and the tiniest amount of cheese. Way too much bread. The Mac and cheese is good even though the way it's packaged reminded me of airline food which made me not want to try it but I'm glad I did as that was one of the best things I ate there.
So delicious. Got the Hawaiian bbq and Thai wrap and had half of both. With the potato side salad.. we decided to always visit this place when we go to vegas. Cheap, fast, and delish
I have heard how great the sandwiches are here, so we came in for breakfast one day.  I had a standard sandwich on a bagel, with eggs. It was pretty good - soft, nice and hot.  Overall I'd recommend this place for a quick breakfast, and next time I see this place around I'll go in for lunch or dinner!
I'm not sure what the hype is all about here. I was excited to try this place based on all the rave reviews. Hell, even the pictures on yelp look legit. That being said, I'm not sure why our sandwiches looked NOTHING like the yelp pictures customers have posted. I ordered the Earl's Club and it was pathetically put together. 80% barely toasted bread. Fillings were flavorless. Turkey was gross and processed. Bacon was virtually non-existent. It's possible that this was once a great sandwich place, but I may have missed the boat. Stars are for service which was super friendly but the food here is WEAK and seriously overrated.
The original roastbeef sandwich is the one to get.  The italian deli was just ok, I had better
Sure, Vegas has some of the best restaurants in the world. So when you want something fast, cheap, and easy, shouldn't it still be at the quality you expect? That's what I found at Earl of Sandwich. Not just a regular sandwich, but a low price hot delicious gourmet grilled sub..  I had the chipotle chicken with avocado, and it was far more than I expected. It was not the best sandwich I've ever had in my life, but it was absolutely fresh, quick, and quality for about $6. If you don't want to blow a ton of money on a quick bite to eat and you'd rather spend it in the casino, then grab a sandwich from the Earl.
I come here more than once on a Vegas visit. My favorite all time is the turkey with cranberry. Mac and cheese side is good, and those brownies.....are. so. good! The place is busy at meal times, so the wait for your meal might be awhile, but it will be worth it. Sandwiches seemed smaller than the usual, not sure if they cut back on sizing. But I guess I don't need a big sandwich anyways! I wished there was an Earls here where i live, but it makes it more special to eat at.  Until next time Earl....
Definitely not worth the hype. Beware of long lines and wait time around the lunch hour. . Ordered the baha salad and chicken avocado wrap and the order was confused. Ended up picking up two sandwiches and had to wait for the order to be straightened out. . The food was good, but not worth the wait or hassle.
So I'm just gonna say it...this is THE BEST sandwich I've ever had!!! The Thanksgiving Holiday one is sooo freaking good! I tried the Thanksgiving one and The Full Montagu, which was also good, but hands down, The Thanksgiving one is THEE BEST!  . . Do you remember the 'Friends' episode where Ross gets mad about someone eating his Thanksgiving sandwich that Monica made for him with "the moist maker"? Well I always remember imagining what this sandwich would taste like with "the moistmaker" and now I know what it tastes like!! This is it!  The stuffing is "the moistmaker"!!! The cranberry sauce gives it the perfect sweetness for the sandwich. And turkey...and that's it! SO SIMPLE SO DELICIOUS!. . This sandwich is that good that I ate it 3xs during my Vegas trip...got everyone I was with obsessed with it too, then brought 6 sandwiches back home for myself, family and friends to also experience THE BEST SANDWICH EVER!  And that wasn't enough because I think about and crave it soo much and was soo sad when I ate the last one! Now that I'm writing about it, I'm tempted to hop back on a plane to eat it ;). . It's crazy because it's a simple fast food sandwich shop and it's THIS GOOD!  It's also open 24 hours which is AWESOME!  It's the bread...it's crack bread :) Do yourself a favor and order this sandwich to experience it in your life! WELL DONE EARL, WELL DONE!!. . Tip- it's located in Planet Hollywood casino right next to mall opening
So I'll admit. I was totally skeptical of the yelp reviews - com'on nearly a 5-star star rating with over 3000 reviews for hot sandwiches!?!! Well I'm not really into sandwiches, but dang, the sandwiches at Earl of Sandwich are amazingly tasty and flavorful and perfectly warmed! Came here on a weekday, mid-afternoon. The line wasn't too bad. You place your order, pay and then they give you a little buzzer to let you know when your order is ready for pick up. We ordered Earl's Club and Hawaiian BBQ, along with sides of regular plain mac n cheese and mac n cheese with bacon. The sandwiches were amazing!!! The mac n cheese with bacon is a must-have. The turkey chili is not worth getting... It's a bit watery in my opinion. BUT, make sure you get a cookie for dessert. They have chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, sugar and recently added peanut butter. I got an oatmeal raisin cookie and I swear it was the best oatmeal raisin cookie I've ever had. Their banana but muffin is pretty good, too!!Definitely check this place out when you're in Vegas. Totally worth the hype! :)
24 hour joint = the place to be after the clubs!. . Yup, this is one of the few restaurants located in Planet Hollywood that's open 24 hours. This makes it the perfect place to grab a bite at and sober up after a drunken night at the club. The past few times I've visited, there has been a line... but don't worry it moves by fairly quick. The sandwiches here are tasty. I would recommend their chipotle chicken with avocados. It's served hot with the cheese oozing out at every bite. This sandwich spot is pretty popular and well known in LV; would recommend you come by here for a bite!
24 hrs open. Inside Planet Hollywood. Perfect hot sandwich. Crunchy and soft bread. Made fresh. Fast and cheap! I had the Earl's club and boyfriend had the Philly.  Both perfect and delicious! We came to eat at 4am so there was no line. Yummy!
Earl of Sandwich rocks! They always offer great, consistent quality sandwiches!. . Food:. Every time I visit Vegas, I always have to drop by this place for my sandwich fix. As you can tell by all the reviews, this place can make a great sandwich.. . I've tried maybe half of their menu, and all the sandwiches I've had were all good.. . The breakfast sandwiches and the Original 1762 are probably my favorites.. . Sides Notes. . Ambiance:. There's lots of seating.. . Service:. The service is great. They make the sandwiches at lightening speed.. . Overall:. For your sandwich fix, check this place out!
Was so excited abouteating here due to the great reviews.....so not worth it. Ordered a turkey sandwich and a tortilla soup. Sandwich was good but small, they only have one size. However the soup was horrible. I'm glad I tried it but I will not be back.
