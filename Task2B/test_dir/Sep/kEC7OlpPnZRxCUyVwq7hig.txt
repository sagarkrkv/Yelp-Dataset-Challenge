My group decided to take an extremely spontaneous trip to Las Vegas on Friday night. We managed to get a room at the Hard Rock. It was our first time staying there, and there was a fairly big group of us. We asked room service to send up a rollaway bed so no one would need to sleep on the floor, but I guess they don't do that even though it says on multiple hotel booking sites that they're available upon request? Kinda lame because the Palms sent us up two rollaways once. We ended up just getting a few extra blankets. . . The room itself was really nice. Paradise tower, two queen beds and a pretty view of Rehab and the strip. The beds were soft and comfortable. Like most hotels, they offer a mini bar and various snacks/drinks and even an intimacy kit. Hard Rock calls theirs the "I Got Lucky" intimacy kit and it's $36. Water bottles are $9. If you want water, you can get a $2 bottle at the vending machine next to the ice machine. We all just got a big cup of water from the cafe on the first floor of Paradise tower for 75 cents.
I reviewed little late.. Our team (office co-works) visit this place 3month ago.. For 4days 3nights.. noise level good.. bed comfort level - so so...(it was not good for me). room is very hot even with AC on all night.. top of the floor there are swimming pool and there are slots a sexy ladies~. Company try to looking for cheapest place.. Yeah for the money it's ok hotel not for the revisit next time.
Worst valet in the whole lv area. The desk was empty for 10 mins and asked where they were the door man said over there very rudely.  Took them 20 mins to get car with no wait. Was also in the casino and had some one ask me for drugs. Walking thru again was stopped and asked again for drugs. Really hr casino, I'm so glad I spend my bank roll somewhere else.
Ill give that hotel 1 star or motel style ,no cufe in room  i asked Y ?they told me even belagio  hotel dont have ,are u comparing to that !!! Slow as speed internet , no buffet. Away from strip its not worth it
Estuve en el hrh tower, excelente el cuarto, muy recomendable. El servicio muy bueno, la vista a las piletas  y todo Las Vegas, es fabulosa.
I really enjoyed my stay here this past weekend for my second time ever being in Vegas. I had such a blast! We upgraded to a 2 bed room with an amazing pool/strip view on the 18th floor for only an additional $20 a night. . . Unfortunately I did not get to experience the awesome pools they have, such as rehab, but everytime we were walking towards the lobby we would pass it and it looked and sounded poppin!. . The casino isn't as big as many other casinos in other hotels but was entertaining. . . The room service was on point, they came to check if we needed anything every morning at 9am and I really appreciated that as to the fact that I love getting and using fresh, clean towels. The last hotel I stayed at when I was in vegas did not send room service at all until the absolute last day that I was there which was pretty irritating so I truly do appreciate the Hard Rock staff being consistent.. . The beds are sooooo comfortable we almost didn't get up once we had laid down!. The only irritating thing I found about the rooms were how dark they were. Everything in the bathroom was black so it was kind of hard to shave my legs even with the lighting, which we kept on while we were out and while we slept all night because it takes a while for the lights to turn onto their brightest form which wasn't very bright either.. . For an awesome hotel and great customer service, I am so surprised that I was not charged more than $500 for my stay here. . Perhaps sometime in the near future I will experience other great hotel service in vegas and if not, well at least I know where I can get it. Thank you so much Hard Rock Hotel for a great weekend experience.
Not quite sure what all these bad reviews are about but I'm glad I had a good experience. . . The rooms are decorated beautifully, if you're into monochromatic decor than you're going to go nuts over it just like I did. . We got the deluxe room which had two queen sized beds in it over viewing a fountain that is shaped just like a vinyl record. The curtains they have in there are super cute, and have the options of blackout or light filtering. . . Anyway, everything was comfortable, clean and the prices were cheap. $100 for a room for a night without any reservations. . Going back to sleep now, way too hungover for this. ZzzZZzz
I finally had an opportunity to stay here at the Hard Rock Hotel! Let's see where to begin. I will start with valet! Valet has very professional and courteous employees that take your car for you and actually they move pretty fast for having as few ppl working that they did. I recently stayed during a pretty hectic weekend aka Mayweather fight weekend along with the pool party being thrown at REHAB! I actually only ended up getting a hotel here by default because for those of you who don't know when you are a hotel guest you get special discounted tickets on REHAB events along with other things that take place during your stay! Also there is a dedicated line for hotel guest as well when you attend your event. The hotel room itself was located in the Casino Tower my room was a pool view on the 11th floor which I feel like was the best location to stay! Beware though of you are wanting a quiet and relaxing stay this tower or view would not be ideal as the music from REHAB is LOUD and you can hear everything regardless if your balcony doors are shut or not! Overall the stay was good! I would stay again and maybe check out the HRH Tower Suites!
Wow. What scammers. In room snack tray is a joke! If u literally pick an item up off the tray to examine it u get charged for it!!! I can only guess the 1000's of unsuspecting guests who have been charged $9 for a water for looking at it! Scumbags. . . This place is a pit hole. Wow. Im not going to touch on the guests who stay here cuz they have the right to.. but wow...just wow. The music wow... bring some advil. . . What pool closes at 6:30pm? One run by a sh*t hole management obsessed with YOUR money. Get to their casino and give them your cash! . . The 'free' shuttle to the strip, that u pay for in your daily hotel charges closes at 5:30pm..really? Its a solid 25 min walk to the strip one way. . . This hell hole sucks...go anywhere else on the strip if u want to be respected.  Clearly management here thinks youre a money sign amd they have no respect for their guests!
I've been fortunate enough to have stayed at several of the hotels in Las Vegas so I've experienced both ends of the spectrum. HRH is definitely on the lower end of the spectrum. As a music/history nut, all the history on display throughout the hotel is AMAZING to look at but it is quickly dwarfed by the clientele and room quality. . . We booked a room through Hotel Tonight. Although it saved us some bucks, I still think the price we paid was too much considering the overall quality of the hotel. We stayed in the Casino Tower which is in definite need of some upgrades. The halls are pretty dingy and the doors/walls are scuffed. The room itself seemed to have paper thin walls and we had the pleasure of being next door to a girls weekend so we got to hear loud voices and loud music all night. At one point, it sounded like our sink was over flowing and was making some crazy weird gurgling noises. Thankfully it wasn't but at 3am it was not pleasant to wake up to and panic about. And one other minor but irritating detail was that the door that connected our room to the other did not touch the ground so a consistent glowing light was shining through the bottom from the other room.. . We ate at FU which was good but VERY empty for a Saturday night. I think we had the entire wait staff taking care of us because of their lack of customers haha. But hey, we will take it! . . The casino floor itself is pretty small as it goes for Vegas hotels. The overall energy of the hotel just did not FEEL like Vegas on a Saturday which was kind of a bummer. We did enjoy some people watching but it all just seemed kind of dreary and since the strip is too far away to walk and traffic on Sat can be crazy, we opted to just go back to the room. . . I think if you are looking for a place to pre-party and or just go to the pool and then be beyond tired so you can sleep through anything, this is the joint for you, but if you are one to enjoy the luxuries that a nice hotel can offer, I'd keep looking :)
first ever bad experience here & it was all about the check in process & rooms not ready. they made us wait indefinitely & the first ever RUDE experience with check in staff. won't be coming back but it used to be cool here :(
This is  not a comment so much about the hotel experience but more for the casino portion of it , I had a horrible time as i am 40 yrs old and was carded through out the casino at least 5 times  the first lady was very nice, and as I expected would card me because they have to card anyone gambling on the floor (understood) but as I stayed in the same spot I was carded by four other people with the last not leaving a great taste in my mouth this guy was very nasty, and not hospitable even after I expressed my concern with being carded 4 times before he approached me he continued to give me a nasty glare I understand I look young. but please get some type of code ofconduct, as to how to treat your guess. thank you
Super Hotel zum Superpreis unter der Woche, aber leider lie die Sauberkeit etwas zu wunschen ubrig. Uberall lag Staub und die Durchgangsturen zu den anderen Zimmern Westen richtig dreckig.
DISAPPOINTED to say the least.  We scored a room for what I thought was a bargain until check in when I learned that an $25.00 per day would be added for a "resort fee". At the desk, I specifically asked if that would include our use of the spa and was assured that it would. Upon using the spa, which is decadent, I learned that there was an additional $25.00 fee for day-use of the spa. . . Gaming area is small and SMOKY. Of course one expects cigarette smoke when in Vegas but the small space made it ridiculous. To their credit, the pit crew was helpful most of the time. . . Please stay here if these things don't matter to you and you do not intend to stay in your room other than to sleep. . . Upon arrival we ate at the PINK TACO restaurant; my chicken tostada salad was flavorless; almost like eating cyber-food if such a thing existed. Perhaps soylent green; I don't know.  Refreshingly, their signature $7.77 steak dinner was VERY good. . . Valet is free, with the exception of the standard tip, and well organized. We never had to wait long to retrieve our car. . . Wi-Fi is free!!!! (if you can get a connection, which I could not...). . Overall, I found the attitude of the staff in-conducive to my return. Will find a better deal elsewhere. . . Rock On
The other complaints aren't all that far from the truth, but I do think it's possible to stay here and have a good time.  I've stayed here 5-6 times in the last 5 years and only once did I have a bad time.  Stayed here for work, a bachelor party, thanksgiving and just recently HRH offered me a free night to come back.  They had new management and I do think they are making a concerted effort to provide better service.  The restaurants are completely fine and Nobu is a very nice option to stay in and dine if you want to have a fancy meal.  Everything else is serviceable, which is exactly what i w=prefer when in Vegas considering all the other ways money flees my wallet.  . . That being said, I really love their pools and I've always had a good time there.  Some people may complain about the resort fee, but if you use the pool the way it's supposed to be used then it's worth it as it is well taken care of and the other patrons of the pool are friendly.  It also doesn't hurt to have good dj's playing and good drinks.  Anyway, I'd totally stay here again and if you don't like the size of the casino or the restaurants then go somewhere else...that's what Vegas is all about after all.
Lets just say i will NEVER book my stay in Vegas at this Hotel..I booked my room 2 months in advance and when i get to the HRH tower they tell me i've been down graded..it was my friends bachelorett party you know how bad i felt that we were gonna stay at a reg ass room on her day..i booked a suite for a reason..not only did they try to brush by saying "its in the fine print, if we overbooked you get down graded" they wanted to cancel my reservation because we werent having there bullcrap. the worst experience ever with this hotel.
Have not stayed in this hotel in nearly 10 years and was pleasantly surprised with my 4 day stay.  First, the hotel remains fun yet it is not too big, making it easy to get in and out of the hotel, to the parking structure, grab a bite of food or coffee, etc.  I don't really gamble, so I have no comment on the action there but I found the staff very friendly and helpful and the room to be very comfortable.. . Not a family friendly resort and the room prices are very great deals.  The hotel is also a refreshing change from the corporate stuffiness of many 'upscale' resorts and made for a nice change of pace while attending a trade show filled with suites and ties.
Sadly disappointed in the room and housekeeping at this hotel. We came in and had to call down as our light bulbs were burnt out, not a problem they came to fix it while we went to eat. Then the next day housekeeping comes in and this is the first hotel of many I have stayed in that they leave the dirty glasses on the sink and don't refresh them. Didn't put any lotion or shampoo out on day 2. Lucky I brought some from home. When checking in we had a case of water as my sister in law takes quite a bit of medication and we were only 2 ladies and no men to help carry and they said that the hotel policy was that the bellman can't take water to the room. So we had to lug it all the way to the other side of the hotel. Amazing customer service huh!!!  Hotel hospitality doesn't exist here.
Slooooooww check in process been in line for 20mins after they called me to say room was ready.  Customer service is at a premium here....
