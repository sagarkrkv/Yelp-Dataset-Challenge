There's a reason I made this place my Vegas staple... it never fails.. . We were in town for a week and I know the wait can get a bit crazy at Burger Bar. Normally, I have no problem waiting it out (the shopping close by is SO great), I mean, who would for quality food? But on this particular Tuesday, we had tickets to see a show at 7:00pm at Mandalay Bay and I wanted to score dinner here before the show.. . I know they dont take reservations but figured I would call anyway and see if I could try to arrange something. The girl who answered the phone gave me the email address of the manager to see if she could accomodate.  The manager was so incredibly sweet and went above and beyond to make sure we had the best table with the best server and got in and out on time to see our show.  Needless to say, the service here is top notch, excellent.. . Now on to the goods: the eats.  I had the Kobe Burger built my own way. The toppings you can choose from are SO original and they have a TON of choices. The meat was insanely tender and juicy, so lean, not an ounce of fat. I couldnt decide whether to pair it with the buttermilk fried zucchini sticks or buttermilk fried onion rings, so the waiter mixed and matched and brought me out a half order of both!!! And I'm so glad that he did... they were BOTH rediculous!! So, so delicious.. . In closing, once again, the Burger Bar out-did themselves and keeps me looking forward to my next trip out west so I can score some more food there!  Would recommend them HIGHLY to anyone looking for a great burger joint.
Definitely a great place to go while you're shopping at Mandalay Bay to watch some football and have top notch burgers! First, try the milkshakes! I built a Nutella and peanut butter milkshake and it stayed perfectly spun andfrozen throughout my dinner! Burger bar lets you build your own burger! I had a kaiser roll, lamb, egg, bacon, chipotle aioli, and avocado.  The burger was cooked to a perfect medium! I like that you can choose anything from high quality beef/buffalo to turkey or salmon. You name the protein and it's there! They even have veggie options for those non-meat eaters (should they exist). Burger bar is particular about where they get their ingredients, and it definitely shows!
Absolute best gourmet burger I've ever had! I always stop and eat here when I'm in Vegas! I highly recommend checking it out and if you likes shakes, you have to try theirs!
Loved my burger (asked for medium well and it was exactly how I like it with some pink all the way through). Also thought the fat fries and onion rings were good with the various dipping sauces (I recommend the chipotle aioli for a kick and the basil aioli for the flavor). Had the Chocolate Cowboy adult milk shake and it was the stuff dreams are made of. Asked for it to go since we were in a rush and it was presented really nice! We went at noon at were seated immediately, service was fast and reliable throughout. Would definitely go back for my burger fix.
Burger Bar is pretty place, with dark wood and granite set against tan (or white but tan looking because of the dim lighting) walls and ceiling.  It's got a comfortable pub feel with very warm, friendly staff.  The burgers are expensive ($20 base), but they are good.  (They probably could be 2/3 the price...but it's Vegas.)
In a pretty obvious cash grab for Hubert Keller (really, dude? A burger spot? You're not Bobby Flay, c'mon and have some self respect), this 'build-a-burger' menu is attractive nonetheless. With upscale options such as Kobe style wagyu beef, foie gras and shallot sauce ("Hubert's personal favorite!" the menu touts), you really can at least feel the emphasis on fine dining. . .but it is indeed a burger place and there's no escaping that. Which is fine - because the burgers are good. Ton of options, and some interesting sides (stuffed poblanos, jalapeno onions) - at a fair price. Again, this is Hubert Keller so you'll pay more than expected (count on $16-$19 for a burger), but the flavor is there and probably one of the best burgers on the strip for whatever that's worth. . . Service is notably sound, and the decor is more roadside grill than Michelin star, but that's okay. That's the environ in which I want to eat my burger.
been to burger bar in san francisco and I am a HUGE fan. The service here however was terrible. It is obvious that  servers here DO NOT split the tips by the way every single waiter but the guy who took my order ignored me when I was standing up out of my seat waving a waiter down for a check. Not once did my "waiter" come and ask how the food was. NOT once did i get a refill on my water. Worse service I have ever experienced anywhere in Las Vegas.
A pretty bad burger...  a burger should never come out wet.....  the bun was literally soaked.  I was very disappointed
Great little spot with killer burgers and a good beer selection. They carry far more beers than your standard run of the mill beer menus. The ingredients  are fresh and the burgers on point. The fry sampler is the way to go as you can choose your favorite types of fries. Get you a selection of dipping sauces and you are in heaven. I opt for the veggie burger and have never been let down. My meat eating friends loved their selections as well and the service was top notch.
Went here with a group of relatives.  . . The build-your-own with Atlantic salmon was the surprise winner. As an Alaskan I was skeptical but it was a big thick piece of fish that just happened to have been cut with a big round cookie cutter. Ordered medium, it was cooked nicely.  We added spinach, asparagus, and Gouda.  Couldn't taste the cheese but the veggies were great; the while thing was knife and fork food, not a sandwich.. . The Vegas vegan was a little lame.  The pile of artfully arranged veggies was nice in theory but was lacking in the flavor department.. . The jalapeno petals were our favorite of the several fries we tried.  Soft and tender with a nice kick.  Skinny fries were nothing special.  I burned my mouth in the zucchini fries more than once, even after waiting awhile for them to cool.. . Relatives passed a lot of food on our direction.  We ate too many fried onions, but just couldn't stop.  Caesar salad wasn't worth more than a few bites.  . . But the pumpkin pie milkshake that my other half's brother ordered...that was amazing. Dude knows how to pick the right indulgences.   Liquid, frozen pumpkin pie.  Mmm, Mmm, thickness.  Which we'd started with a shake of our own: would have been a better choice than all the fries that sat heavy in our bellies long into the night.
Herbert Keller's take on an American tradition.. . Located along bridge between Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Burger Bar has established itself over the past years as a standard in higher end gourmet burgers.. . The menu here has some nice selections and variety for most who enjoy a great burger, healthy and not so healthy options are available. . . When approaching with a group make sure to grab a reservation. Most nights of the week can be busy as Mandalay Bay and Luxor are generally busy but when a convention is on it can be packed. . . My recommendation is the Spicy Lamb Burger. As lamb can be little hard to find in town, Burger Bar seems to get it right. Most the burgers will come with fries, but are able to changed out for salad if need be.. . One also great aspect of Burger Bar that isn't really talked about is the Beer Menu. They carry a fair amount of local and nationally crafted beers that is rotated out month.. . Overall. Service: 4-5. Food: 4-5. Cleanliness: 3-5. Coming back: yes
Service is fairly average but everyone is very nice. Burgers are good, but the toppings steal the show. Every time I have been there I have tried a new delicious topping including: caramelized onions, jalepeno bacon, aged white cheddar, avocado, bbq sauce, foie gras... The list goes on and on. I would save your money and get the regular burger and load up on add-ons, as opposed to splurging on the kobe burger. It's not real Kobe Beef even though it sounds nice to say.;) Wouldn't make a trip to Mandalay Bay just for this place, but if I'm hungry and I happen to be in the area, why not.
Ok so just to begin I had the most expensive burger on the menu because I was winning money and I figured I would live it up.  Okay so maybe it was not worth $65 BUT it was so so so delicious!  They have an awesome beer selection to boot!  Staff is friendly and the place is packed for lunch (that should tell you something). I stop in just about every time I come to vegas!
Over-hyped. . Build your own Kobe burger was good, but you have to add everything and that's where it really adds up. $24 not worth it. . . Fried pickles were whatever. The batter didn't even stick to the pickles so you ate the pickle alone and then the batter. (Came with 6 little ones.. For $6.95!) . . Fries were good but still not worth the overall price. (Also small portion) . . . My friend got the build your own Atlantic salmon and it was a mess to eat.
Can I give this place zero stars? My wife and I went to this place all excited about having gourmet burgers, this place has no clue. Server took our order and brought us our drinks, this is the only thing that was right-- everything after this point was horrible. . The food took forever to come out --about 45 minutes. Then our order was wrong; it looked like they brought some other table"s order as they were putting it down I was saying 'I think that's somebody's else's order. The guy gets all mad takes some of it back and leaves some. The server comes back apologizes and says our order will be right out and she will try to hurry up the kitchen. I'm thinking that's a bad idea to rush things and sure enough, I was right. I ordered the burger medium --it came out raw with blood pouring or all over the plate. At this point the manager comes out and tells us that that is the way they cook them. Wow! I am thinking food poisoning with raw meat. I wonder what rare would look like? Terrible place!
Had very high expectations but wS disappointed.  Beer selection was excellent, enjoyed the ambiance and layout of the restaurant.  Burgers were disappointing, also didn't like that you had to pay for any dipping sauces for the appetizers.  Sweet potato fries were very good and the speed of service was good.
That donut burger tho......
Great Burger
Really wanted to like this place and leave them a great review. I am a burger guy and anytime I get a chance to go to a good burger place I take it. . . We got here and sat at the bar. I was impressed with the food options. I picked the Buffalo burger cooked medium. A little pink. With my choice of wheat bun and toppings. Got our order in and waited about 20 minutes for the food to come. No biggie. . . Our food comes and I bite into my burger and the inside is rare. I send it back because the meat is so raw on the inside. They then cut my bite off and browned the area they just cut off. So it appeared cooked. I took another bite and it's still raw inside. At this point I am not sending my food back. I ate the bun and left meat there. $30 burger and I couldn't eat it because it was so raw. Will never eat here again.
