I stayed here Sept. 21-23, 2014. My previous stay was a couple years prior. This is definitely one of the best properties in Downtown LV, BUT it was obvious that management had not a lot of money into keeping the hotel up. Hotels.com and other sites have it rated as 4-star, but I would put it as 3-star, particularly, when compared to other hotels rated 4-star. Casino has a good vibe, and decent sports book, though could use more seating. They have a poker room too with daily tournaments. The rooms are comfortable, beds are not too soft, and they have flat screen TVs. Best thing about the resort is the pool/shark tank. Cons: old town LV tends to be dirty.  Hallway carpets looked pretty dirty. Valet was slow.
Venue:  Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino.  . Decor: Older, old school like Casino. . Service: Friendly. . Environment: A Mix of older people and young. . Food: N/A (although they had food, I can't speak on it).  . Prices:  Cheap Gaming, very affordable.  . Debbie Downers:  I didn't win lol j/k (kinda).  . Conclusion: This venue like other nearby Casinos within that vicinity is old school.  Very Dark, not as open spaced like the newer ones on the strip.  They provide affordable buffets (that I can't directly speak on).  The gaming is cheap like $3 min Blackjack, craps, Roulette, poker and more.  It's pretty much about superstitions & luck as far as if you favor one over the other.  However, this venue seemed a lot bigger than its counterparts.  Ageneral pool area for patrons, buffets and gets very busy.  .  . Overall: C
Not terrible, but for the price you can do MUCH better. I live an hour and a half outside of Vegas so I come here often. I've stayed in many hotels in this awesome city and I have to say that Golden Nugget was the biggest disappointment. We splurged for an anniversary and thought that as a 4-star it would be worth it. Our room was very poorly lit, there was no view whatsoever, and the air con did not work. The customer service was blah, and they will charge $10 for you to drink crappy hotel coffee in your room!!! True whole thing felt like a ripoff, and the whole place seriously lacked character. If you want a good place to stay on Fremont, go to the El Cortez! Much better place and 1/3 the price!
We booked a room a few days before our trip on 8/30/2014and this was one of the only hotels that did not want a two night stay. After reading some of the reviews on yelp and a few other sites I have to admit I was a little scared. When we arrived we were met by the valet and just let them park the car.  It's 2:00am and we just want to get to sleep after driving in from Williams AZ.  We checked in and things went fast the whole process took less then 5 min's  (unlike the Flamingo that took 2hrs) we were given a room in the rush tower Room # 22219. As I got off the elevator and walked to the room I was reliving the reviews that I had read online and thinking of how I would explain this hotel choice to my wife. As I opened the door and walked in I swear the room looked like something out of a luxury spa. over sized bathtub marble countertops and sleek modern fixtures.  We booked at the price of $79.00 a night but I think I would have been pleased to have paid double that.  Great room Great service, Great casino Won $500.00 on a $1.00 Slot   If were ever go back we'll be right here at the golden nugget! If I could give it more then 5 stars I would.
Stayed and played. Rooms soooper clean. Front desk staff very helpful.  Pit bosses were also pleasant.  Buffet was great as usual.
I first stayed at the Golden Nugget with my husband three weeks ago and have been raving to my friends and family about the service and accommodations since our stay. . My husband booked our room through a third party site, but we were still treated with the utmost respect. The valet was great, the desk attendants were great, the cocktail servers, the waiters and waitresses -- everyone!. When my husband checked us in, the desk attendant ensured that our room was accessible. I am temporarily handicapped due to an injury. When she saw me and my husband asked if she anticipated that I would have trouble, she obtained approval for a room upgrade at no additional cost. I didn't expect much except an accessible bathroom, but she checked us into to a Gold Club suite on the 16th floor! Our room was amazing! I had access to an accessible restroom and shower stall. Our bed was comfortable and not too tall. It seemed like a bit much -- until I made use of the extras. One evening, I used the sofa and television in the living area while my husband was downstairs gambling. I was tired from a long day ofsightseeing and shopping in the city. The chaise in the room was also very comfortable. I dozed off on it when we first got to the room because I was afraid I would have trouble getting in and out of the bed, but it wasn't a problem at all once I got over the initial apprehension.. I could go on forever about the pool and the restaurants -- even the buffet was pretty good. Overall it was an exceptional experience and when I'm completely recovered we will definitely plan another visit. When a company goes out of their way to make every guests' needs a priority they will always have my loyalty. Hopefully we'll see them sometime before the end of this year. If not, we'll be back in the spring. Golden Nugget: you won me over and that is difficult!
The room was nice but NO FREE WiFi and you are charged for everything under the sun. . Next time for sure staying on the strip, Free WiFi and your given gifts for staying, not charged for everything.
I took my kids to the Golden Nugget because I thought the shark tank in the middle of the pool would be cool. That was the only thing cool about it and even didn't make up for the rest of it. They do not have enough room at the pool to accommodate the size of the hotel. They are trying to keep up with the strip hotels by drawing people with there cool pool but it isn't working.  You can't enjoy a pool if you don't have a place to sit or to even stash your stuff. I swore I would never take the kids to Las Vegas but they are much older now and the Golden Nugget was off the strip plus the shark tank indicated to me that kids would be more welcome there then say, the MGM. So here I go with my big review so bare with me, I have a lot to say that will hopefully help you.. . First of all I paid for priority check-in. They told me that that would guarantee our rooms were connected and that we could check-in earlier. We arrived at 11:00am and I knew there wasn't anyway that rooms would be ready but they told me to check back in an hour.  We left our bags at the counter and went exploring. I came back at noon and still no room, still no problem because I knew check in time was at 4:00pm and even though we had priority check-in I certainly didn't expect rooms to be ready. They took my number and said they would call by 2:30pm. Fine, but I did think that wasn't exactly 'early' check-in.  They knew we were arriving at 11:00am and told me over the phone that we would have pre-assigned rooms.  Still no call at 2:30pm so I went back to the desk and once again, still no room. Again they told me they would call by 3:00pm. Still no call at 3:00pm.  Now I have four tired kids and an annoyed husband and I was pissed. I went back to the front desk for a FIFTH time and they said still no room. I asked them why I had paid for priority check-in if we actually didn't get to check-in early and we didn't have pre-assigned rooms. The front desk person went and got the manager and she came out and looked on the computer and told me that we did have pre-assigned rooms but they had granted the guests in one of the rooms A LATE CHECK OUT!  I am not a person to yell but I friggin' lost it.  Why the hell would you grant a late check out to guests in a room that was supposed to be pre-assigned for early check in?!  They scrambled and found connecting rooms with one of the rooms cleaned so we could take our stuff up....and they refunded my priority check in fees.. . Second, our rooms keys worked intermittently.  We had to go to the front desk several times for new card keys.  You need your card key to get into the pool. One morning the five of us went down to the pool early (to try to get a couple chairs) but my oldest son wanted to come down later. When he got to the pool his card key didn't work. A line started building behind him and when the 'security' woman ran the card she said very loudly 'nope!' and then ran it again and said 'nope!' a couple more times. He was horribly embarrassed. He told her his parents were already at the pool and could he just please go find them and bring them back and she told him absolutely not and then yelled 'next!' so she could continue to check in other guests. He went back up to our room and sat in the hall. He couldn't call us because since he was going to the pool he hadn't brought his phone with him . Luckily my husband realized it had been about 45 mins since we had come down to the pool so he went to look for Jack and that's when he found him sitting in the hall. My husband was furious but by the time we got back down to the pool the woman was gone and there was a new dude checking people in. I got the chick's name, Mary Ellen, and wrote a letter to the Golden Nugget but never heard back.. . The cost of the rooms was fairly reasonable but if you want to go to the strip a couple times then you need to add in the cost of transportation back and forth which isn't cheap.  The Luxor was pretty close to the same room rate it's a lot closer to the action.  Fremont is cool but not 5-days-in-a-row cool.
This hotel deserved less than 1 star!  We had mold on the ceiling of our shower for our entire stay.  I complained to the front desk and they did nothing, no follow up, zero.  Order room service at 6pm Saturday evening and the cart was still in front of our door in the hallway at 8am when we left the room on Sunday morning.  Customer service in the hotel was horrible!  When leaving our floor on check out day the maid complained toy husband about people having a do not disturb sign on door because she has to clean 15. Rooms a day and how she doesn't like getting sent to other floors.  Unprofessional!!!  Paid for priority check in for a guaranteed smoke free floor and room-room seemed ok but was definitely not on a smoke free floor.  Pool was ok but not enough room to accommodate all swimmers
I am writing this review because of BRAD at the bar just outside the golden nugget on Fremont street.  He's just REALLY GEEAT!  I sat outside yesterday and he made me feel very welcome. I was so happy with his service and dry/comedic personality that I had to introduce. My husband!! He is down to business but kind and just seriously funny!  You're the old school kind of bartender that Fremont Street should have forever!!
In the past we favored the Nugget because it was good value, pleasant rooms and located right in midst of downtown. We haven't been there for a year or more and this past visit totally turned us off. I agree completely with other reviews about charging for everything e.g., coffee in the room ( not room service ) is 2.50 a cup, Internet is 13.00  per 24 hours and bottle of water is 2.00. I would expect these prices at a 5 star establishment , but in my opinion, it is not even close to 5 star, maybe 3 star. No complaints on room, clean and well done. Prices have greatly increased. We don't  plan to return !
Just checked in and have never stayed off the strip before. I'm here for 7 nights for work. It looks really nice but I have already received bad service 3 different times. The valet gave me attitude because I was asking where self parking was, the registration attendant was not at all welcoming, and my bartender/server spent the whole time I was there off in the corner. I was the only one at the bar. She asked me what I wanted from about 15ft away while she was pouring a drink for one of her servers and I had to yell because she couldn't hear me. I'm a stickler for good service and this hotel obviously doesn't feel that's important. It's gonna be a long week....
Spent seven days here and had a wonderful time.  All personnel were helpful and friendly.  Stayed in a Rush Tower room last year and it was very nice, however this time we were upgraded (without asking) to a corner suite.  Oh wow was that a surprise!.  Housekeeping service was top notch, great views, full bath and 1/2 bath, 2 refrigerators and 4 TV's.  I felt like a queen!. . Only complaint was that our key/room cards shut down several times.  Since we needed that card for the elevator it was a big problem and embarassing to have to get out of the elevator and find a desk person to re-activate the cards.  Also card worked in the elevator, then not at the room.  Twenty floors back down to get that card re-activated.  This is a problem that really needs to be fixed.
It's always great to have a staycation here in "Sin City." Contrary to the belief, us locals DO NOT live in casinos/hotels. Would be nice though....ehh...maybe? Maybe not.. . Stayed at the new, renovated tower, the Rush Tower. Rooms are very VERY modern and up to date with flat screen HD tvs, modern decor and furnitures, and dual sinks in the bathroom. Most importantly, everything was clean. I'm a clean freak and I didn't feel grossed out at anytime during my stay. So if at all possible, stay in the newer tower. We got a pretty good rate, mid weekday. . . Knocked one star off because the walls are thin. I can hear the guest next to me using his speakerphone option....at like 6 IN THE MORNING!!!!! Also heard housekeeping clanging some stuff around. Ugh...def not for the light sleepers. But I get it...it IS an older hotel afterall.. . Also, I'm not sure maybe their air conditioning on the casino floor blew out the night I was there but it was stuffy as hell!!!!!! The mixture of cigarette smoke + all that body heat from a packed casino floor definitely didn't go so well with me. And maybe lady luck didn't know I exist that night cuz the slot machines were a snoozefest. Boo =( Had a better time gambling at The D.. . Either way, solid 4 stars for the hotel. (Didn't go to the buffets, restaurants or the pool so I can't really comment on that part but I've heard positive comments.)
I stayed here for two nights when visiting Vegas a couple weeks ago. It overall was a great stay here. I stayed in the Carson Tower which are the cheapest rooms in the hotel. It only cost me $100 out the door since I booked it through Expedia while it was on sale and the Golden Nugget is the highest rated hotel on Fremont Street so I couldn't pass it up. The pool here is just amazing!! The fish/shark tank in the middle of the pool with the waterside is awesome!! The only things that were bad about my stay was in my room, the room was nice but there were like 2 or 3 little rips on the walls and when I left a note to housekeeping to change a sheet that was ripped, they didn't do it which annoyed me but I called them and they took care of it right away which was nice. I would be willing to stay here again when I decide to stay on Fremont St if I can get a room cheap enough, hopefully I will get some hotel discounts from them since I signed up for their players card and I gambled like $55 away here so I would think they would want me to come back by offering me room discounts.
