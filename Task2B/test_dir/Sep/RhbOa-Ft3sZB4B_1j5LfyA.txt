We have been coming to this place for over a year now and we are never disappointed. They do have a long wait time during certain times, but well worth it! . We have tried their steaks and eggs, French toast, biscuit and gravy...All delicious!. . The service is also very good, all are very friendly!
We found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed. There was a short wait, but the restaurant does an excellent job of getting customers in and out quickly. The service was friendly and fast. We really enjoyed the food; excellent value!
We were in the area looking for a branch place and found this restaurant close by. Went in and found this to be very popular. Very cozy atmosphere. When the food was served, we were pleasantly surprised cuz it was big plate full of food. I had my best pancake experience here. Love this place and will visit next time I am in Vegas. And yes, it is child friendly too.
Mr. Mama's is a great breakfast restaurant. So what makes it great?. . - The Food. Portions are large (an omelette comes with a side of hash browns and they are super super tasty). It's one of those large ovular shaped plates that will last you two breakfasts. You MUST try the BISCUIT!!. - The value you get based off the large portions is awesome.. - The service. We got to meet what seemed to be the owner there and he gave us all a hearty hello along with how we liked everything and even held the door for us as we left. The other servers were so diligent in making sure we had everything we need.. . So quick tidbit: Mr. Mama's it not named that because of a relationship to a mom (even though it may seem to be that way). Rather, it has origins of Greek descent and the owner is so happy to share it with everyone. It's well worth a try if you are able to make it off the strip.
I'm a person when I'm LV usually we opt to going to breakfast or brunch buffet this time me and my buddy decided to try a local restaurant for breakfast instead and of course yelp for the rescue on choices... after reading about few we decided to try Mr. Mama. I was impressed from the moment we stepped in and we were greeted by the owner and he told us the approx. wait time and he was very honest up front about it and we decided to wait anyway after all it is morning rush that is admirable to make sure your patrons are happy and well informed of their wait time unlike other restaurant where they say oh 20 min and 40 min later your still waiting with no ETA .... . The food was amazing great portions and delicious me and my friend decided that this will be one of our definite stop for breakfast every time we are in LV great food great services and very friendly owner who took few minutes of his time while managing everyone and taking down the names of the folks for the waiting list to chat with us and explain his family heritage in restaurants. Bottom line highly recommended and well worth the waiting time
My bros and I stopped by here during our vacation in June and it was the best breakfast we ate in town(better than on the strip)!! The managers were really down to earth and stopped to have a nice convo with some of us cool guys from the Chi. Must see spot!
How has this place gotten such good reviews? Everything about it is mediocre at best. Atmosphere and decor is frightening, and for the kind of food you get, it's terribly over priced. 2.50$ for a TINY cup of shitty coffe?(it should be no more than a buck), the gravy that came w the "biscuits and gravy" tasted like it was a premade- packaged gravy mix (not home made) the home fries were overwhelmed w oregano. French toast was good but not special. I don't know- I just hate going out to eat at a place that makes me feel like I can make better food at a cheaper price.
First time to Mr. Mama's. It will not be our last. I tried multiple things today. I had chilli, biscuit and gravy, a Denver omelet. All of it was good. It's off the beaten path in a strip mall but don't let that deter you from going.
One of the best breakfast places we have found so far.  Chicken fried steak is awesome and the portion of food is HUGE so easy to share.
Great Gravy and Fun Staff. Worth braving the heat and leaving the casino. It's better than home made
Fantastic biscuits and gravy!!!! My husband and I were traveling cross-country from NY to CA and trying biscuits and gravy everywhere we stopped. We were shocked to find that the absolute best biscuits and gravy in the country are in Vegas!! Seriously. Bacon, sausage and a hint of maple. Sounds crazy, but it doesn't taste sweet. It's pure genius. The coffee was not bad either, and the customer service was wonderful.
A breakfast joint located in middle of nowhere, in an industrial complex neighborhing gun stores, motorparts, autoparts, and other man toys.  There isn't much ambience, but the food is delicious, especially the pancake, they were so buttery!  We ordered the Mama pancake combo and it was good size portions with fresh home fries and eggs.  I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas.
A good selection of breakfast items and as I'm told by my wife the beat Greek Omelet in Vegas. Relatively small but the wait if any usually goes fast, not located in the most convenient of places but still worth a trip for something different that won't disappoint. With the owner actively walking the floor greeting the patrons and checking on their needs it reminiscent of time when that sort of behavior was the norm opposed to the exception as it is today. Good service and decent food makes Mr. Mama's an obvious choice for those in the area.
It was ok. Sausage Gravy from biscuits and gravy looked and tasted like raw pork. Potatoes were good and not tough to fry a couple eggs. My wife's pancakes were very good.   Probably won't go back.
Great place for breakfast.  I especially like their French Toast...very fluffy and not too sweet.  Their ham is the better quality meat.  Each meal is very large portion.  Friendly staff.
We wanted to give this place a try. It has pretty good reviews and figured it would be nice to try a new breakfast place. Firstly, the staff is extremely friendly and are super efficient. I love that they use a iPod ordering system, but thats cause I love technology. Secondly, the food was good, it was not the best breakfast I have had in Vegas, but it was very good. The breakfasts meats are large, unlike some area places. The pancakes have a great flavor. My son had the chocolate chip pancakes and said they were delicious. The decor in this place could use a little work but for a nice little dive breakfast place Mr. Mama's gets it done. Definitely worth a visit or two. Also want to mention the pricing is a little better than some breakfast places, but they do not have a kids menu. That alone is the reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars.
This place is yummy, with very good service. Everything we had was good , the cinnamon rolls are YUMMMY!!!! . The biscuits and gravy are a different mix if sausage, bacon and maple syrup in the gravy different but still very good, my husband had the breakfast burrito he said it was pretty tasty with lots if meat, eggs and cheese not stuffed fill of potatoes. Overall this place is great. Go early because when we were leaving there was a line out the door.
Great food, I had chicken fried steak and eggs the sausage gravy was great not spicy, more food then you can eat.  My husband  has the short stack pancakes with eggs and sausage. Great !  . The service was Super.  Multiple people assisted, coffee cups never empty.  if you go to Vegas, skip the hotel restaurants for Breakfast.  go to Mr. Mama's.
Breakfast. . Small place, about a mile off the strip.  He mentioned that they are looking for a new spot though.  His turnover rate on the tables was incredibly fast, so a wait of 15 minutes is pretty typical.  The food is your basic fare, nothing that stands out.  However, our waitress did an up sell, without telling us that that there was an additional cost.  Now, 50 cents isn't going to break the bank, but they really should tell the customer.
Flavorful,  like-home-cooked food; genuinely friendly service; reasonably priced. Win win win! Eggs cooked perfectly,  potatoes were crunchy,  French Toast moist and cinnamony, Greek omelet had tons of feta. 5-star breakfast worth the weekend wait.
After first stopping at Denny's we were turned away from all the smoke from smokers, I clicked on yelp and found this hidden gem. . They serve breakfast all day even at 11:00 when we got here. Space is nice and cozy. Waited twenty minutes but guess what NO SMOKING!  That was worth four stars, . . Started with a cinnamon roll which my wife and I shared, I had to fight to get some from her.. . The food was fabulous and the guy in the kitchen was funny with his jokes and quick wit while putting up plates. . . I will be back.
Excellent homemade food prepared with love!  The staff is welcoming and friendly. The portions are generous to say the least, and the prices are EXTREMELY reasonable!  If you want a bite of heaven, order the cinnamon roll as an appetizer and share it at table, YUM.  We will definitely be back. Another bonus for us; no smoking allowed!
The Bay Area must represent!!  My boyfriend and I visited this place last week while hanging out in Vegas and I'm giving it 5 stars because not only was the food on point the service was as well. The owner was amazing and we enjoyed the breakfast.  Thank all of you for making us feel welcome and serving us a great breakfast.  P.S.  We enjoyed Rolling Smoke too. :)
Bottomless Coffee. Buttermilk Biscuit. Jumbo Cinnamon Roll. Double Chocolate Chip Pancakes with Two Eggs and Bottomless Coffee (Daily Special). Single Serving of French Toast. . One of the longest standing members on my breakfast 'to-do' list and a place to which I'd purchased a $20 discounted gift-certificate some six months prior it was finally on Saturday that I drove down to Mr. Mama's and although the small breakfast and lunch spot is unlikely to win any awards for innovation it can only be said that this truly is a place committed to putting a smile on each patron's face.  Undoubtedly a locals institution in which nearly every other customer was a regular with orders frequently anticipated by staff it was just past 7:15 that I was invited to seat myself and with no less than three servers offering to get me coffee as I perused the menu it became immediately apparent as to why the restaurant was filled to capacity by eight o'clock.  Focused mostly on diner staples with a whiteboard of specials just left of entry while prices trend far lower than almost anywhere else in the 702 my meal began with Mr. Mama's oft-raved $3.50 cinnamon roll and with a soft, yeasty base rife with cinnamon and butter beneath sweet frosting the hype proved justified, a smallish biscuit proving less worthy its $2.75 tab, though still quite good.  Preceding next to plates more hearty it was with a thin slice of French Toast that my meal moved on and opting this time to bring my own maple syrup from home the result was improved, though still nothing to write home about, particularly when compared to fluffy flapjacks studded with dark and white chocolate, a daily special matched with two eggs and at least six cups of coffee for less than $9.. . Likely generating its fan base more through low prices and friendly service rather than by location or particularly excellent food I cannot say I'll be rushing back to Mr. Mama's soon, but for locals on a budget or those with little one's looking for a good breakfast at a great price the restaurant definitely fills a niche - the open-kitchen of blazing-fast line cooks and televisions tuned to college football providing a bit of entertainment for those interested in such things, as well.
We went on a Sunday more around brunch time and there was about a 20min wait. I ordered a cinnamon bun, and pancake platter. All of it was delicious, great fluffy pancakes. My husband got the steak and eggs, his only complaint was that the steak was a bit too fatty. I really liked the sourdough bread they use for toast. My son are so much of his food it looked like a competitive eater competition. . . My only regret is that I didn't order the Cali Omelet. Holy cow. I saw several of those being served to people and it looks incredible!!! Next time.
The owner made it for us! Good food friendly service, off the strip prices! . . Thanks nick, we'll be back for sure.
I Absolutely love Mr Mama's! They have amazing food i have never had anything bad with this place. The staff is great and friendly, I usually order and pick up my food, but  last weekend i brought my family there and it was a 30 minute wait which sucked but it was so worth the wait! Definitely my favorite Breakfast spot in Vegas!
Without question, the best dinner food in Las Vegas. The service is amazing too!
Wow! I honestly did not expect the food to be so good! But it was so good we had to come back the next day!. . It was worth the short ride away from the strip and the modest 30 minute wait both Saturday and Sunday. . . As soon as we walked in it felt like we were visiting friends. The staff was courteous and friendly. We were given menus to peruse while we waited and noticed people waiting had coffee in their hands. Nice touch!. . After being seated in the small dining room (side bar: why are the best places always so tiny?) we knew what we wanted so that sped up the process. Our home-cooked style meals arrived and we were blown away. On the first day I had the egg sandwich with cheese and avocado on Texas Toast and hash browns. Upon our return the next day I had a cheese omelette with home fries and hot chocolate. I loved both meals equally!. . This is the place to go to if you want a no fuss, home-cooked style meal. Don't come here expecting something fancy or gourmet.
This place has your basic breakfast food but done well.  Very welcoming place with big blue walls.  The waitress was nice and didn't rush us, and the prices are reasonable.. . I had some pancakes and hashbrowns and my friend had some french toast and hashbrowns.  We both agreed the hashbrowns were done perfectly.  The pancakes were good too.  I'd like to come back and try and omelet and a cinnamon roll.
5 stars for hitting all five imperative points when it comes to breakfast (in no particular order):. 1- Cleanliness : simple decor, clean restaurant (tables & utensils, etc.) and put together staff/uniforms.. 2- Friendliness : greetings when we walked in, conversation about my broken leg & knee scooter, history of restaurant, 2 Check-Ins on the food & thorough good bye's!. 3 - Price : $6.75 for my Egg sandwich w/ Hashbrowns AND a drink - PERFECT! . 4- Taste : DELICIOUS. ..Egg Sandwich (over hard) w/ American cheese & bacon on Marbled Rye and side of perfectly cooked Hashbrowns in which they add Sage(?) Which gives it a unique , almost Mashed Potatoes taste...REALLY GOOD! . 5 - Speed : Though we went during their self proclaimed , 'down time' - so not sure how accurate this is for others. However, we were seated immediately & got our food within 5-10 minutes! . Bonus - The water, though served in the OLDEST SCHOOL cup, was SO crisp & De-lish! . Altogether-YUM! MUST TRY!
I've never given a five star review  but today is the day.....we came in for breakfast on a Friday morning after reading some yelp reviews...... . we were greeted right away and asked to sit at the first table inside the door "the best table"....haha...it was great service to start off and only got better..... . We order the chicken fried steak combo and pancakes and eggs...gravy was really good....it was delicious....everything can out quickly and hot.....pancakes were really good, fluffy and nice texture, no rubber nasty microwaved pancakes here...... . Shawn and Julie took care of us but the owner was walking around talking to everyone who came in and left.....will be back on next trip..... =)
Everytime I come to Vegas I will go here for breakfast. It was that DELICIOUS. . . Their GREEK OMELETTE was one of the best omelettes I've ever had. And the same can be said about their FRENCH TOAST, which was also fantastic.. . INEXPENSIVE, DELICIOUS, and FREINDLY customer service!. . I was greeted with a smile and friendly conversation at the door, after calling ahead by phone and speaking with two other very friendly employees.. . This place is an absolute MUST GO for breakfast in Vegas!
Best breakfast place in Vegas for that darn hangover. The food is inexpensive, delicious, our order came in super quick, and the staff was so friendly! We weren't sure if venturing off the strip was a good idea, but it was so worth it. Great find!
Great small location. Weather you on a budget or just looking for some good food this is your spot in vegas. Must come in early to avoid the long lines though. Worth the wait
My bf took me here for my birthday and it did not disappoint. Hands down the best scrambled eggs I've had at a restaurant! I know it's such a simple food dish but it's exactly how scrambled eggs should be. Not to mention the hashbrowns was cooked to perfection! The sausage gravy was not my favorite but the chicken fried steak itself was amazing! The service was fast and friendly but the food definitely won me over! We'll be coming back for sure! Thanks for getting my birthday started on a great note!
Ordered the Breakfast Burrito w/salsa, Mr. Mama's did not disappoint. Very good breakfast option while in Vegas!
The food is great but the owner/manager needs to get out of the way so the servers can do their job.
My family and I went to Mr Mama's for breakfast our first morning in town. My fiance and I had the Cali Omelet which was delicious. Not sure what my folks had but they enjoyed their meal. The service was excellent and the manager(owner?)came out to meet and greet with the patrons. I love it when a restaurant has employees that care about your business. I highly recommend Mr Mamas's for breakfast when in Vegas. We will go back!
I've been here several times I've always got great service. Food is freash. Everyone makes you feel like family as soon as u walk in the door. This is the to go to spot for a a nice freash meal great service and at home feeling.
There's a reason this place is rated what it is. Extremely fair prices. Huge portions. DELICIOUS pancakes and omelettes. Wife and I had a bill of $22.70, we've had to leave tips larger than that on the strip for service that doesn't touch Mr. Mamas' staff. Bald dude that greets you at the door may be the owner; he is genuinely nice and conversational. Waitresses were happy and helpful and got me a free pancake cause we didn't need two plates of toast.. Hell yes! I can't wait to come back.
Off the strip but well worth the drive. The pancakes are phenomenal. I am not a pancake person but I could make these pancakes a habit- fluffy and light. Biscuits and gravy also very yummy. Hubby had the breakfast burrito and liked it.. Great service and cheap
We were in vegas for the weekend and wanted to try the local scene. We saw all the reviews and decided to come here. The service was great and the restaurant was clean. To be honest the food wasn't as good as the reviews had said. The gravy was bland and needed seasoning and the steak was okay. Our eggs came out cold. Biscuits were good but the pototoes needed some help. They were oily and slightly over done. The price was fair but not sure if I would come back or recommend.
Excellent food, quick service as well. We went with an order of French toast as well as biscuits and gravy. Definitely at the top for restaurant B&G. Will be back!
great food visit everytime im in Vegas one of the greatest breakfast places in town and is super super delicious 6 stars
World's best pancakes. The service was excellent and the food was 5 star. I was happily surprised when we got the bill $38.00 for 4 people.
Excellent.  Only about 4 miles off the strip.   I came for breakfast.  I waited about 10 minutes for a table. Worth it totally!  My $12 breakfast had a custom 4-egg omelet (ham, mushroom, spinach and jalapenos) with hash browns and coffee.  I am stuffed.  And will eat a lite lunch.  The atmosphere is casual and everyone is very friendly.  So as Ah-nold once said "I'll be back."
Absolutely great! Very friendly service even though the place was jamming, food was great, orderwas accurate, wait wasn't a big deal at all. Kids loved the house made cinnamon roll, I had several veggie options to consider, and the prices were great! I spoke to the owner and they are moving shop down the road (west of Decatur I think?) later this year. If in Vegas and you want an affordable local type joint go HERE!!
Had the Cali omelette since I'm from Los Angeles... It was great.  My recommendation is to have seating outside and serve coffee to waiting clients.  Keep them happy! Great food... Awesome value
Not bad, just not great! It's solid if you looking for a cheap meal however there are some sanitary issues. Let's just say my cutlery was as clean as it could have bee and the same goes for the table. Once all that was resolved it was okay. The potatoes were definitely the highlight of the meal.
One hour wait, 45 mins later we finished eating and left. The cafeteria decor with good employees delivered great food at our request.  We ordered the Cali omelet which was cooked to perfection.  We also ordered the Chicken fried steak which tasted a  little like  cake batter,  but good thick gravy. The biscuit was small and dry so I couldn't tell if it was great because it was covered with gravy.The french toast was dense and ordinary.  The pancake was the BEST item served: so delicious.  It was very light, fluffy, and yummy.. Was it worthwaiting for in a sterile decor with a young crowd, not really!!! It's not an energetic and happy place to enjoy breakfast. I
Ordered the Cali omelette but changed the side to the most amazing biscuits and gravy ever.  Oatmeal was so so,  but the coffee was  good.  Even their toast is good.  Loved the vibe, everyone working there seemed to be having a good time.  Their biscuits & gravy are amazing and I never really was a fan of it before.
I really want to like this place. The constant line out the door tells me I SHOULD like this place.... . I was finally able to get a table here this weekend with no wait; I know that's a rare thing here. We usually do a little drive by on Sunday mornings and opt for another breakfast location when we see the horde of people standing around the door. But this Sunday was our lucky day!. . The staff was super super friendly upon our arrival. The "Make yourself comfortable" line got me too. It's a very customer driven way to say "Have a seat." Nice touch, guys.. . I wasn't impressed with the menu. It was incredibly ordinary. It was pretty much your standard diner/American fare menu. No playful item names or interesting combinations. I was at least hoping for an original take on an breakfast tradition (I love that!). . . I opted for an egg white veggie omelet and my partner went with the breakfast burrito. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and white nice and pipping hot! However, I really can't say that there was anything memorable about it. It was a standard egg white omelet with a side of toast and fruit. I did appreciate that the waitress told me the fruit was out of a can. Many places wouldn't be so forthright with this information. The breakfast burrito wasn't great either. It was a little on the greasy side and a tad undercooked on the hash browns inside. The food was done well, but again, just very standard.. . What I took away from this place was the stellar service. Julie, our waitress, was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. She told us they all read the Yelp reviews and do everything they can to improve on their business with the customer feedback. Multiple members of the waitstaff came to check on us and refill our coffee - all with a smile. . . Like I said at the beginning of my review, I really want to like this place, but there was just nothing memorable about the food. If you are craving a simple home cooked meal with stellar service, this is your place. But if you are looking to experience something new, you might want to look elsewhere.
This place was bomb!!! From the moment we stepped out of the cab we were greeted by the owner to the wait staff. Everyone was super friendly and the place was packed. We did have about a 20 minute wait and it was on a Monday morning, I can taste why!! The pancakes were fluffy and I'm sooo not a pancake person but a sucker for white chocolate so it was a must try, best decision I made all day!! It was like eating a cloud!! Our table pretty much ordered the whole breakfast menu and not one thing was bad. I also did order the cinnamon roll and it too was amazingly fluffy. You must go and try!!! Order the iced coffee too!!
This little breakfast/lunch spot is in an industrial area. You'll miss it if you aren't specifically looking for it, but not many people miss it because on Sunday morning it was packed!. . Ambiance is diner-style/small cafe, small place with not a lot of seating. Be prepared to wait if you come when it is busy. BUT - wait you shall, because they are serving up yummy, stick-to-your-ribs breakfasts that hit the spot!. . I opted for the Cali omelet which came with Cheddar Jack Cheese, Sausage, Pico de Gallo, Salsa, Sour Cream, and Topped with Avocado. The omelet was well mixed, I got a bit of everything in every bite. Pico and sour cream are a nice addition, but too much SC and the omelet gets a little funky, so when I go back I will ask for it on the side. This dish also comes with your choice of home fries or hasbrowns. I got the home fries which came out as thickly sliced discs of potatoes, very good, and it comes with your choice of bread (two slices). I washed it all down with some delicious coffee. Not sure what type they brew here but it has a very good, flavorful, almost sweet taste which I really enjoyed.. . Service was on point. Check out their specials when you arrive, they are on a white board by the front entrance. . . Overall, this is a spot worth checking out, especially if you are a lover of breakfast.
Found this place by YELP -- excellent breakfast and best biscuits & gravy in town!!  Loved it - will come every time I'm in Vegas!!
Came here for breakfast after landing at the airport. We were greater by the most friendly host I had ever seen. As we sat down he asked where we were from and we he heard we were from the SF Bay Area, he immediately made us feel at home. He then found out it was my daughters 21st BD and sent over a housemade cinnamon roll! . . Portions are good size and service is beyond awesome!! . . Just a tip...if your order the biscuits and gravy then you need to know that their gravy is a little different BUT still very good. Taste it first before you order...they encourage tasting because they want you to leave happy....can't beat that!!
Great place! Had the California omelet and it was amazing. The girlfriend had French toast which was delicious as well. Next time we are in Vegas we will definitely be heading back to Mr. Mamas.
