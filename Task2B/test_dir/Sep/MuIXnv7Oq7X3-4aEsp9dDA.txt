If you are looking for a fancy dinner but want to attend casual this is the place for you. I love good food but hate getting all dolled up to eat. I strolled in with lip flops and felt super welcomed. The staff was friendly and helpful despite that we looked like slobs on vacation. We ordered the short ribs... ridiculously good, the sauce- heaven! And the buttermilk chicken, cooked perfectly and flavorful throughout. Would definitely goo again and order the same thing.
Definitely did not enjoy this meal as much as I hoped to. I ordered a shrimp with risotto and it was lackluster in flavor and disappointing, especially for the price. For dessert we got a chocolate brownie dish with ice cream. It was also just ok...again, for the price I would have expected better.. . My boyfriend got braised pork and it was also underwhelming. The meat was tough so his teeth ended up hurting from all the chewing. Service was decent but the price was high. Food is not terrible, but I think there are definitely better options in the area.
It was my first time eating alone at such a special restaurant. . . The host and waiter led me to an intimate table for four and made my self date one of the most memorabledinners! . . Sam, my friendly waiter, checked up on me every time he passed me by and kept me company like a friend. He also surprised me with the menu of the Original Chopped Salad, which was just a perfect combo of all the healthy grains and vegetables you would normally not eat by themselves. I can't wait to try the recipe myself and see if I can live up to Citizen Public House's expectations! . . There's an intimate bar in the middle of the restaurant where all the couples sit. But I'd also recommend this place for those of you who want to bring your close family members and for all of you who are looking for some alone time; the wonderful hosts at CPH won't leave you alone.
Was a solo diner walking in for dinner. Sat at the bar at servers were very friendly. Solid drink/beer selection. Ended up ordering the olives plate and the lamb burger. Olive plate was solid for the $5 price tag but the lamb burger was incredible. Could tell from the first bite that it was grade A meat and the burger itself was somewhat of a gyros style flavor. House ketchup was also really good. Definitely a place that I would go to again and recommend to those who enjoy good drinks and quality foods.
Stoppped in for a drink and appetizer with some co-workers.  It was happy hour so a nice surprise 1/2 off drinks!  Had a really nice Cab, we also had the fondue as an appetizer, it was very nice.  If I'm back in AZ, would love to have dinner here.  Very nice vibe!  The bartender was very nice and made sure we were taken care of.
One of the best of Old Town Scottsdale. Great service. Amazing drinks. Hubby loves the famous chopped salad. The burrata and bacon fat popcorn literally changed my life. The chicken is so juicy yet crispy on the outside. I have never been disappointed! Can be a long wait so take that into consideration.
A happening place for the younger crowd, everyone was well dressed, but not suit and tie fancy. Anyways, the food was super delicious; it was modern twists on classics. We had the Mac and cheese, which was a win, and fondue with the most amazing sausage I've had, and perfectly ripe Asian pears. My friends had steak and pork rib, and the pork rib was easily the best dish. It was infused with a subtle flavor none of us could place, and was perfectly tender. Many of their desserts had bacon in them, and it was good, but I am partial to not putting bacon in everything. We had the pecan and bacon brittle and the peach and bacon pie, which was empanada style. Over all it was a really good restaurant with a great atmosphere with good service and great food.
Wow, we were blown away with our dining experience! It was completely unexpected. We truly enjoyed the delicious food and service was OUTSTANDING. I rarely identify people in my reviews, however Gary deserves the praise. From the moment we sat down, he was friendly, charming, and attentive. His positive attitude and demeanor was infectious and it absolutely made our dinner more special. Even as he tended more tables, he hustled to get to everyone. We were so pleased. To top off an amazing evening, he waited for us at the entrance and held the door open as we left!. . The Good Citizens Social (H/H) is 3-6pm daily. All bar snacks, draft beer, and glasses of wine are half off, their barrel-aged cocktails are $5, and three appetizers are discounted. We were dining unusually early since we wanted dinner before the Jason Mraz concert, however, we were able to take advantage of the Social.. . Ruben opted for a pint of Anchor Brewing California Lager ($5; H/H $2.50). I settled on The Craftsman ($12; H/H $5) made with Barrel-aged Jameson Irish whiskey, Cocchi Americano, and Charbay Green Tea Aperitif.. . Rosemary Roasted Nuts ($5; H/H $2.50): A mixture of nuts roasted with rosemary. Great flavor and a wonderful snack to munch on while having a couple drinks.. . Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn ($5; H/H $2.50): The popcorn was very lovely and the addition of bacon and its fat was scrumptious. Another fantastic snack!. . The Original Chopped Salad ($12): Smoked salmon, Israeli couscous, arugula, trail mix of toasted pepitas, black currants, and aged asiago, freeze-dried corn, marinated roma tomato, and pesto buttermilk dressing. Wowza! I knew the salad was popular (I mean, it has its own Facebook page), but I didn't expect to be hit by the combination of flavors and textures. It is so, so good and surprisingly light. Great dish to split as an appetizer. The recipe is available on their page, but it's much more complex than I thought and it's one I'll leave to the professionals. I would absolutely return just to eat this salad again..and again.. . Buttermilk Chicken ($20): Roasted Smart Chicken breast, Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, sweet corn-butter bean succotash, and Pecorino. We chose to also share our entree and our server was kind enough to split it for us. The chicken was moist and flavorful, the succotash was creamy, and the brussels sprouts were perfect. All the flavors worked and it's probably one of the best chicken dishes I've had.. . (All their desserts are made by Tracy Dempsey Originals, a local company creating sweet and savory confections). . Bacon and Peach Hand Pie ($11): Candied bacon, salted Bourbon caramel ice cream, and peach jam. The pastry was perfection combined with the sweet and salty bacon, ice cream, and not-too-sweet peach jam. Fantastic dessert option!. . Bag O' Bacon Brittle ($10): The Original Bacon Pecan Brittle packaged to go. My family and I love brittle (and c'mon, bacon?), so I picked up two bags to take back to Vegas. I haven't had a chance to indulge yet, but I will update when I do!. . I highly recommend dining at Citizen Public House. Although I like to try new restaurants on future visits, this is somewhere we won't want to pass up!
We had an amazing experience here! The server was knowledgeable, friendly and professional, and the drinks and food were fabulous!! The chopped salad was unique and incredibly delicious!! The pork belly pastrami was unbelievable, as was the dessert! highly recommend!
I do like this place, but I feel there could be more option for entrees and appetizers.. The famous chopped salad is very good. I'll always order it when I go. I also felt the red wines were nothing new n sub par. The beer was ok n the vodka to gin room upstairs makes a good effort.. I've never had a bad meal here but I also haven't been blown away.. I came in for the duck my friend had ordered my first time there but it was no longer on the menu, everything else didn't suit my tastes for the night, so I ordered the hummus, chopped salad n lamb burger. It was fine. Lol sorry I'm tuff.. I would have  liked a lil more something on the burger. The hummus I almost forgot about while writing this, and the salad stood out again. Well anything w smoked salmon tastes f*ing good to me. I love to make certain restaurants staples for when guest come to town, this didn't make the cut.
Citizen public house was a great experience. The service has always been great. The chopped salad and their scallops are amazing. Will be back again.
All around outstanding dining experience. Our waiter, Sam was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly. Nice open casual dining area. I've heard many good things about this place, and let me tell you, the ratings are true. Very attentive wait staff. Never an empty water cup. Price was good for portion size and quality. Lets talk about food now!. . Had to take advantage of the great happy hour prices. Ordered the Kilt Lifter Fondue, which was served with sliced pears, sausage and bread chucks. Large portions & very tasty.  . . We split the chopped salad with smoked salmon. Incredible mix of flavors, every bit was a perfect mixture of awesomeness. This dish is a MUST TRY.. . I ordered the crab cakes app as my main dish. They were very good, perfectly cooked with no weird fishy taste. You can tell they are made fresh, not from frozen. Very tasty.. . BF got the meatloaf. It was recommended to us by our waiter. Glad we listened to him, it was fantastic. Great flavor, you can tell they use high quality meat. There was a perfect amount of sauce and nice portion of potatoes. . . We sampled the bread pudding and chocolate brownie. Both very rich and decadent. We did not try any of the cocktails, but the selection was huge. Maybe next time. Can't wait to come back.
This restaurant is really amazing! I love that it has a small menu. I love that it only has a couple dessert items but they are tremendous! The beer selection is perfect.  The wine selection is great.  The service rocks, Gary handled our large table with ease, thank you Gary! Even the manager Steve came over to greet us and ask us how our meal was...a top notch restaurant in old town Scottsdale.... Eat it, love it, live it..... I had the chopped salad, perfect. I had scallops, prepared to your liking. I also really enjoyed  their spinach and garbanzo bean soup (best tasting soup I've ever had and the recipe was done by one of their servers, excellent excellent Dish)!  Yum yum for my tum tum :-)
Can NOT say enough wonderful things about this place!! The staff, service, atmosphere & food!!! We had my daughters wedding dinner here (9/5/14)  and my son coordinated everything with Owen, the Manager & the Chefs Craig & Ben. Our party was an intimate 7 and from the moment we arrived we were treated with the highest of regard. Eric the Bartender started us off with the tastiest Sangrias, followed by several courses of appetizers (the chop salad was to die for!) and finished it off with their Porcini Filet Mignon - which was truly decadence!  We were full beyond measure and they packed us with to-go boxes for what we couldn't finish.. . Absolutely every dishwas beautifully presented and tantalizingly delicious!! I can not thank Owen, Craig, Ben, Eric and the staff of Citizen Public House enough for making such a monumental occasion so very special and personal.
The food is generally really good here, but the superstar is the chopped salad. . . I can't believe the best chopped salad I've ever had would be in Scottsdale, although I don't generally go around hunting for chopped salads. . . I always make a point to stop by whenever I'm in town.
