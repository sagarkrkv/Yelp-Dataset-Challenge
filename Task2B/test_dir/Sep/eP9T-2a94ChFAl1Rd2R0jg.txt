Booked for 179 a night on hotewire, which was nice for a hotel that was just off the strip.  Resort fee made up for the difference between this and a hotel that was on the strip, so that was a lost cause.  Free valet (just like every other hotel).  The rooms were large and clean, the bathrooms had a TV in the mirror, a Jacuzzi tub, and separate toilet/shower areas.  The bed was comfy, there was a mini-keurig, and the air-conditioner worked (after returning from a trip across Europe, a large room cool room was welcomed).  The stairwell was lonely and the stairs felt flimsy (thin ironwork, paint on wall not finished). The pool area was nice, the jacuzzi in the corner was awesome (glad that it was hidden from plain view), and the drinks were reasonably priced.  Yes everyone at the pool was in shape, yes the music was too loud, but it was still a very nice pool area, and we didn't seem to mind.  I really can't find anything I did not like about the hotel itself.  . . The location, yes, about a 5 minute walk from the strip, and the sidewalk disappears if you walk on the north side of Fashion drive. The shuttle runs until 2 Am but only goes to Caesars or Wynn; we took a cab as it was faster and we could go wherever.  Did not try their overpriced restaurant, and did not get to even sit at the bar (which closed at 12 midnight on Saturday night, fail).  Would recommend this hotel if it sat in downtown San Diego or Los Angeles, but in Vegas, you want to stay on the strip, go downstairs to gamble and drink no matter what time it is, and enjoy the view(s).  Will be staying on the strip the next time.
I got this this Hotel from Hotwire. It's my first time in Vegas so it's kinda hard to decide where to stay. So bf and I decided to use hotwire that way we will be surprised as to what hotel we're gonna get. I've been to a lot of nice hotels. But my first time experience of hotel in Vegas weren't as nice as the rest of my vacations just because it's from hotwire they wont consider my 4pm late check out although they give me a 1pm check out since we checked in at 11pm. I was happy coz of the good reviews from YELP, some even got an upgrade so I signed up for their membership/rewards card thinking I will come back and stay at the Trump next month. But yeah they can't consider the 4pm late check out. Well Hello! it's Vegas and nightlife is what it is. Had to rush myself for check out the next day and left my souvenir in the room. Gladly we we're still having lunch in the area and we're able swing by the hotel to retrieve it from reception. Rooms are really nice, clean and odor and smoke-free. Noisy train passing by though! I didn't give it a 10 because toiletries are incomplete. At the poolside you will have to get up your lounge chair to order and wait at the H2Eau bar for your drinks since no server goes around that time. No help or assistance for assembling the umbrella. Me and two other guests had to do it ourselves and it's not easy.. A bit off the Strip. 25$ Resort fee.
We booked through Travelocity Top Secret Deals, therefore we didn't know what hotel we had gotten until after paying. I selected a 5 star, pet friendly hotel. . . The room had a nice view and was roomie. the bathroom is very spacey as well.. . $200 non refundable deposit for the pet fee per stay which was charged twice on my final invoice. I had to call them to get it fixed.. . The toilet is within the larger bathroom and has its own glass door. It had a funky smell, kind of the smell you get from the low water consumption urinals from Wal-Mart, etc.. . The staff was friendly but not as top notch as other hotels within the segment. . . The decorations are a bit outdated. The carpet in our room looked old and had various small stains. The massive, nice window was poorly cleaned and was streaky.. . The Wi-Fi didn't work through out our 2 night stay. Resort fee is $25 and was told included "free Wi-Fi and Coffee.". . It is a smoke free hotel so that's nice.. . It was NOT a bad experience but I will not return to this hotel. At least not by choice. . . Vdara is a much better choice in my opinion.
This is very elegant hotel but a little out dated.  Spacious and comfortable rooms and bathrooms nice Jacuzzi tubs and great costomer service.   The Wi-Fi is atrocious and a pain to stay connected as someone who trys to unplug but doesn't have the choice to be completely disconnected it was a constant struggle to keep the device's on the hotel network to manage few emails.   The tv and cable was on par with a holiday inn, and for what ever reason the hotel bar closes at 11pm.  Being vegas one whould think the hotel whould have bar open a little later.  I personally prefer the cosmopolitan.
We stayed at the Trump late last year.  The entire property is immaculate, smoke-free, and far away from the standard Vegas scene, if that's what you're looking for.  The downstairs restaurant and lounge were very memorable, and every room is a suite.  We were able to fit in a few games of pool on their tables near the lobby.. . Only problem is the location.  It's quite a walk to the trip, so cabbing it is a must.  The complimentary shuttles are always packed, but it's an option.  Also, there's no downstairs casino, so if you get the urge to play late at night, you're quickly discouraged by the lack of proximity to a machine or table.
This is my first time staying here and I love it! Even though trump doesn't have casino in here I still love it! U can actually walk to everywhere from here and after a long time out there u will feel very quiet and comfortable when u come back to ur suite... And also I love the smell of this hotel.. U can smell the flower everywhere and each room is clean and modern!! Strongly recommend.
This is a nice hotel. The room has small kitchenette with stove microwave toaster and Keurig coffee maker. The K coffee cups were included which is nice. Huge tub in bathroom and nice separate shower. Pool is elegant. . Negatives would be very poor (awful) wifi internet connectivity(free, but really so bad it was non existent) and a restaurant with not much of selection on the menu. My AT&T reception was very spotty to make internet connectivity even worse. . . It's just right across the street from the mall with Newman Marcus entrance. Walking distance to the Wyn and Encore for a casino. . . The entire hotel is no smoking, and I found NOT having a casino a plus.
Absolutely Beautiful hotel! I loved staying here. The bed was so pillowy soft, I didnt want to get out of it to go have fun in Vegas. I just wanted to sleep all day. Everything was nice and clean and just great. I think I will stay here every time I go to Vegas. I just loved it! It's not on the strip, but its not far from the stip either. Directly across the street from a mall with great stores. Just loved it!
Love the hotel and beautiful rooms with views.  Hate the constant rap music at the pool that invades every room within several floors above the pool.  And then there is the middle of night blasting freight train whistle from UP.  Doesn't the Donald have some pull with those guys??  He could probably tip them to forget the whistle blow through the neighborhood.
The price was right and the suite was amazing. If you want true 5 star i am not sure las vegas even offers it.... Just keep that in mind. Someone posted disappointment that the service was not 5 star and they were actually correct, but the people are nice and helpful, so that has its own value coupled with the views, etc.
My friends and I really enjoyed our experience at Trump. I have always stayed at one of the hotels on the main part of the Strip, so at first I was a little wary of staying on the edge at Trump. I am SO glad that we did, though. Because Trump doesn't have a casino and is nonsmoking, the experience was just way more relaxed - and we were still able to go to other hotels for restaurants and clubs! The staff at Trump is excellent and everyone we interacted with was super professional, courteous and just plain friendly. The rooms are large and clean, and I absolutely adore the deep tubs in the bathrooms. We spent Saturday by the pool and reserved a cabana, something I highly recommend doing. The pool is low key but the music is great, and Sebastian (the person helping us) was the best! My only complaint is that the cabanas are poorly designed - the AC is positioned in such a way that it actually sends cold air OUT of the cabana instead of into it...weird. We also ate a lot of food at Trump, both in the restaurant area downstairs and through room service. Room service was AMAZING (get the onion rings!) - I highly recommend ordering in after a long night, they serve 24 hrs. The breakfast downstairs was stellar too - I loved the crab cake eggs benny. Overall this was just a great experience and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!
We love this hotel.  In our view the only place to be in Vegas.  Totally non smoking and no casino.  Jacuzzi in the rooms/suites.  No shopping mall in the hotel,  It is ALL good!  Only downside, no espresso machine in the H2O Bar beside the pool.
We really love the Trump hotel as it's less hectic than many other hotels on the strip.  The staff is very friendly.  The gentleman that checked us in (Christopher D.) was amazing and set the tone for this stay. . . Drawback - the really crappy corkscrews they provide.  It broke off in a very nice bottle of wine and when I called to seeing I could get an asho or waiters corkscrew I was told that their normal corkscrews break off all the time and after 30 minutes no one ever showed up with a new corkscrew.  Just called to cancel it and went out instead.
Stayed here for a few days in September.  The good...it does not have a casino, so it is not nearly as crowed and busy as the other places in Vegas.  When you walk into the Trump you can smell the amazing aromas of well, bamboo, others are calling it flowers because they can see all of the pretty huge flowers in the lobby.  However, if you go into the Trump gift center they sell the scent sticks that they use to scent the lobby.. . The elevators are super fast, and everything is clean.  One weird part about the room is that you have to go thru one super heavy door in the hallway, then they have two separate rooms from this tiny room.  So your door is right next to another door.  So when you are sleeping it is easy to be awakened by your next door neighbor.  . . The rooms are really nice and big, the beds are not the most comfortable but okay.  The rooms come with kitchenettes butno plates, or cups, or silverware, you can boil some water, and put it into a disposable cup that is it.  The bathrooms are nice, they have big jacuzzi tubs, big showers and a tv in the mirror.. . There is a train that runs by at like 3 something in the morning, you can definitely hear it.  I had earphones in a few nights.. . Our first morning housekeeping, which was nice,  was there at 8:25 am, weird.  We kept running into them as they would come to our room at different times thru the stay.. . The pool area was nice, it looked like it could have been vacuumed tho.  The chairs around the pool are comfy but are all stained and look worn.  They have round beds next to the pool which nobody uses and they charge extra to lay on one of those.  Also the pool area is really windy, even though it is hot the wind was a bit much.  The pool staff was nice and always checked to make sure you did not need anything.. . The hotel is a bit off of the strip and is a pain in the foot to get back in forth between them and society.  The Trump shuttle is lame, I think they only have one shuttle bus, so you could be waiting for upwards of 30 minutes for it to pick you up from Caesars.  When it is over 100 degrees, waiting for that long just doesn't make sense, so you end up buying a lot of taxis.  The taxis charge you an extra $3 or $4 to use your CC.. . Overall, there were some inconveniences about this hotel, I do not plan on making any return trip to Vegas anytime soon, but considering the cleanliness of the Trump I would probably stay there again over a cigarette smelling casino hotel.
Great hotel, wonderful service. The hotel is casino/smoke-free so it smells AMAZING, like a spa. It was our anniversary so we were able to negotiate an upgrade. They were running a special at the time so we got an awesome room for a great price (Thank you Priceline and Trump staff!) Our room was on the 32nd floor and we had amazing views all around. We stayed in a one room suite, so we had floor to ceiling windows and huge rooms to lounge in. The bathroom was really clean with a huge shower and soaking tub. Awesome kitchen, with a Wolf stove and full refrigerator/freezer and a breakfast bar. If the location deters you, they have a free shuttle that runs every 15 minutes. Also, we were right across from the Fashion Place Mall, so we were able to run to the ABC store in the mall and get some decently priced snacks. Overall, this was a very friendly, upscale hotel, good for families or anyone really looking for a clean, quiet, retreat from the Strip.
Just got home from a four night stay at the Trump.  Got a great deal on Priceline for a five star hotel.  Loved that it was no smoking and no casino.  It was quieter and nice to get away from the smoke and hustle and bustle.  A little far from the strip but cutting though the mall was easy and fast if you walked to the Wynn or TI.  All of the employees we interacted with were very friendly, helpful and nice.  The resort fee was an added charge, but not a huge shock at $25 per day.  Nice that it included free bottled waters and wifi.  I'm sure there were other things included in the resort fee that we didn't use. Taxis sure added up, so be prepared for that sticker shock.  We kept wondering where all of our money was going --- the taxis were a big expense.  Overall a great experience and I would definitely stay here again.
It's all right.. The good:  Big rooms.  Friendly service.  Clean.. The not so good:  Signs advertised a Happy Hour at the DJT (lobby floor restaurant); staff confirmed Happy Hour 5-7PM (1/2-priced drinks and some food); but, when we arrived at the DJT around 530PM in September, we were told that the Happy Hour was discontinued as of March.  Huh?. Pool service -- sorry Sebastian -- was terrible; had to request our glasses of wine multiple times (same thing happened at the Peppermill).. Only two restaurants in the entire place, and one closes at around 530 daily.. Not a destination place, despite being sort of off the Strip.. But good for kids (safe and secure).. Anyway, not as tacky as I imagined a Donald Trump place to be.
This was my first time staying at the Trump Hotel. Overall nice hotel, but not suited for . . Pros:. -no smoking in lobby and rooms - great for people who are allergic to the smoke. -rooms and bathrooms are of a nice size, especially if you're sharing the room with multiple people. -while the pool itself is small, it's enough for the number of guests who are lounging around. You can always find a chair and spot in the pool without too much trouble. It's also a low key atmosphere for those who just want to relax and read a book. Waiters seem to come around frequently to serve people at the pool.. -There's a mini kitchenette - but you have to ask for utensils and cooking materials. . Cons:. -slightly off the strip which requires either a taxi or short walk to the wynn. . -while the hotel is nice, it's comparable to your average business hotel you would find in any other city. If you're looking for a "Vegas themed" type of hotel, this resort is not for you. . -no casino, so you'll have to walk to the strip for night life. . Summary: Good place just to stay for a quite non-smoking room. I'd recommend this hotel to people for whom it is not their first trip to Vegas since it's not quite the "one-stop shop" for shopping, night life, and food.
