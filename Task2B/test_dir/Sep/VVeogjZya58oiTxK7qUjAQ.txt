Probably about the best traditional crust pizza I have ever had! Staff was FANTASTIC! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the drink menu was a little light. Other than that GREAT!
Love this place! Pizza is divine, atmosphere is awesome. Totally recommend the margherita pizza. So fresh, so tasty. Even my kids love this place (we measure most restaurants by how quickly our kids shcoff the fare), so there you have it!
Found this place through yelp with tons of awesome reviews and happy to say that Pizzeria Bianco did not disappoint! I'm a big fan of thin crust pizzas and this place might be one of the best. . . The restaurant is pretty small but I loved the atmosphere of this place and the beautiful brick exterior of the restaurant was my favorite! We almost didn't come because we didn't want to have a long ridiculous wait, but I'm so glad we decided to come anyway. Luckily, we went there after the lunch rush around 2pm so we got seated in less than 10 minutes! . . The service was great and the pizza was amaaaazingly delicious! We devoured our pizzas in silence cus it was that good hahaha. I'm actually craving it quite a bit as I am writing this review.... everything about the pizza was perfect! It was a 10/10!! :D We got the Margherita and the Wiseguy pizza. The toppings were extremely fresh and I loved the smokiness of the crust from the wood-fired oven. Wish we got to try all the other signature pizzas as well. The pizzas are a bit pricey compared to the size, but I think it was worth it :)
Overhyped as well as priced. My pizza was forgettable and the crowd seems to be younger hipsters who are all happy to see the hostess and bartenders (though I doubt they know each others names). If you go there, avoid Fri/Sat.  I'd rather do NYPD pizza, unless you're more concerned about loud conversations than food.
Took my 12-year-old grandson to the science Museum walked out the back door and pizza Branco right behind us . had an amazing woodfired pizza it was great and he got an Italian ice for the first time ever he loved i Service was great food was delicious price was right
The pizza was great, but what I would like to talk about  the rice pudding.  Rice pudding is deceptively hard.  It is usually goopy or too dry.  This rice pudding was perfectly consistent,  and you could taste every grain with a nice burst of vanilla.. . As I said the pizza was great.  Also, the wine pours were generous.. . The service was great.  I really had a great experience.
I've been just to see what all the hype is about. And to answer the main question: yes, the pizza is very good,. Now, the wait to get said pizza in yo belly makes this place an annoyance. Yes, they provide ample seating area and a nice flow of drinks to keep you going, but to me, I'd rather go to Cibo Pizzeria for much better pizza and not much of a wait.
Extremely overpriced, for so so pizza.  I took my family there for lunch.  3 pizzas and an Ice tea, with tip $79.  The pizza is maybe a medium size and nothing to write home about.  There are much better pizza places for a whole lot less money.  I would not go back and would not recommend.
Great atmosphere. Friendly service. Fabulous Pizza.  We ordered the Margarita Pizza which, because of its simplicity, is a great test of a pizza joint.  While the pizza cooked in the wood fired brick oven, we snacked on homemade hard crust Italian bread and olive oil.  The pizza arrive in 15 or 20 mins and did not disappoint.  The crust was perfectly cooked and the toppings were fresh, hot and delicious.  It's a small space and often a long wait but well worth it. If it's busy, put in your name and head next door to Bar Bianco until your table is ready.. . The location is a little tricky to find since it's on a one block long pedestrian only street between E Van Buren and E Washington. There is valet parking off of N 7th St or garage parking off of N 5th St by the Arizona Science Center.
I really, really wanted to be blown away by this place after hearing all the hype about it....but unfortunately, it felt short.  The atmosphere is great and the food is good, but nothing out of this world, and definitely not the best pizza I've ever had.  It's also pricey, for the amount of food that you get,  but I guess you also pay for "the experience".  I'd be willing to go back and give it another try, but I would not wait for hours.
Pizzeria Bianco is definitely one of the premier pizza place in Arizona. I've been there a few times now, and I would say it's worth it every time! I have a friend who goes there frequently for her birthday, and I'm happy to tag along!
Flew from San Diego to check out this legend and yes, it's very good.... But not the best pizza in the USA. Our group tried the BiancoVerde with prosciutto , the Rosa ( yum), and The Wiseguy. Solid. Nice servers and the place is cute!
This place is definitely overhyped for no apparent reason. The ambience is really cozy and nice but the bread they give you while you wait is so tough and tasteless.. . We ordered half Rosa and half The Wiseguy. The pizza's were standard with no exceptional flavor at all. Not crave worthy at all. Servers were really friendly though!
Too much hype for decent over priced pizza. Service was good but I don't think I would go back. Got the margarita pizza it tasted good but it was so expensive. And burnt even though I understand the concept of brick oven.
Cool little place, great service. After reading all about how this place has the best pizza ever, I was disappointed. The pizza was good. That's it. Good. Nothing to write home about. I might go here again if I'm next door at the Science Museum or something, but I won't be going out of my way to come here any more.
What a wonderful restaurant!! Absolutely loved the food, the ambiance and the service was excellent. My good friend and I stumbled upon this place after a long day in the Arizona Science museum. You literally walk outside of the museum and there it is! So convenient! Especially since we were all hungry. We chose to sit outdoors and enjoy the beautiful outdoor seating area, the kids had plenty of room to run around while we enjoyed a glass of wine and waited for our food...SCORE! We had the farm salad (arugula, fresh pear and Gorgonzola), fresh mozzarella/tomato salad and kids stuck to a margherita fresh basil pizza and a pepperoni combination pizza. Everything was delicious!. We will be coming back for sure.
Great food in a casual environment. The waits are rather long so we tend to go off times.
Had wanted to get out to this place for five years now and finally made it. Was worth the wait. Great atmosphere.  Margherita Pizza was amazing. Caprese salad was a bit salty, but otherwise very fresh.  Friendly service and validated our parking for the garage so it only cost $1. Will definitely be back.
This place was extremely overrated.  Any place that makes you wait three hours to get a ticket to be seated for something as simple as a pizza is not worth the time.  There are these new things, they're called reservations.  Hello?  . .  I wanted to try this place when it won best pizza in the US.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.  All I can say is someone either paid a lot of money to make this place the best pizza place, the contest was rigged, or all of the judges were high and had the munchies.  . . Considering that most pizzas take about 15 minutes to make, in the time it takes to get seated I could have had a dozen pizzas from other places that are a million times better and way less pretentious.  I won't be back.
Good pizza and service but didn't really blow me away.
We went here after years (literally) of hearing how amazing this pizza is and how highly rated it was on a national level. The place was so adorable and tucked away in the parking lot with cafe lights strung across the patio. Such a warm and welcoming restaurant. We walked in and were greeted by the friendly servers and chefs. The inside is tiny (10 tables or so) but we were seated right away. . . We ordered a pizza and got half salami, half margherita. It took about 10-15 minutes but of course that's because it was being freshly baked in the giant wood-fired brick oven.  The pizza was really GOOD, it is exactly how I imagine it would be in Italy.  Super thin crust, slightly burned edges, sparse on the tomato sauce, and fresh ooey cheese and toppings. So yummy. Now I know this is a personal opinion, but there is another restaurant in the valley (it is a chain. i know....bad) that we both think is better. And cheaper. . . But if you want authentic pizza and a romantic, cozy dining experience, I highly recommend trying Pizzeria Bianco!
Truly amazing pizza. I was going to post a picture, but I ate the pie too fast. It was one of the best pizzas I've ever had, and I'm a Jersey pizza snob, so that's saying a lot. Wonderful.
We had lunch at Pizzeria Bianco while passing through Phoenix in June. I had read  about it a few years ago.  The pizza was very, very good. Thisis authentic Italian style pizza, don't try to compare it with most local pizza joints.  We did not have to wait long at all.  We sat at the bar and the service was excellent.  Servers were all very friendly and helpful.
The atmosphere was great! The pizza was so simple but so delicious! I will definitely be back!
What can I say, it's great pizza!  I was pleasantly surprised that the restaurant lived up to the hype.  I was fortunate enough to have our local team join me for my visit so we ordered one of each of the six pies they offered.  The favorite amongst the group was the Rosa and the Biancoverde.  The Marinara was a close third.  The service was excellent and the food was spectacular.  The beer list at the main location was poor but their "drinking cabin" next door had great beers on tap.  They have to run over to the other building to get you the better beer.. . My advice: Go on a weekday and go early.  Get there at 5:45 and the place is yours.  Avoid game days.  I can see why thus is on most top 10 pizza lists.
Enjoyed the handmade mozzarella and tomato appetizer. Then the Margherita pizza with a 4 Peaks Lager and Chianti. Pretty darn good!
