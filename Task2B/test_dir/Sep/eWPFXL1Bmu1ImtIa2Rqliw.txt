I don't think I will be staying at the MGM again. They always mess up my reservation and when they messed up my reservation for my bachelorette party that was the last straw! We booked a queen suite attached to a regular queen room and the paranoid person I am...I called multiple times to confirm this because I had 10 girls and we all wanted to be together. I arrive Friday at 9 AM only to find out that there are no more queen suites available...I was SO UPSET. They told me that it was first come first serve...WTF I RESERVED 2 ROOMS AND WAS VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT I WANTED AND PAID FOR IT! After a hour of waiting they finally came up with something: a king suite attached to a queenroom -_- We took it because we had no choice and some of the girls slept on the couch and a couple on the floor...to make things worse they didn't even give us a cheaper rate! SO LAME. . . MGM will definitely not be my first choice in the future...this experience made me not want to come back!
One star. Noise can be heard from the strip on the 28th floor. REALLY?!? woke up both nights multiple times to sirens, a helicopter flying to the Las Vegas airport .2 miles down the same road this Casino/Hotel is on!! its ridiculous!!! if your going to be in a loud area then at least have sound proof windows or get windows that dont let as much sound it like other hotels. also, there have been many instances when my family comes to this hotel that they ALWAYS happen to give a king bedroom when we ALWAYS specifically asked for 2 Queen bedrooms. of course they think its our fault and say they can do nothing about it because they were filled this Labor Day weekend. well, i didnt buy it and i asked to speak to the supervisor and oh what do you know they had a 2 bedroom room open and made us pay 20 extra  a night. no big deal about the 20 extra a night but the main point was that the check in lady said there were no more rooms available. why did she have to say that to us? she didnt. and made us lose my respect and trust to anyw hotel worker i will ever speak to again in the MGM grand. . . like i said before, you can hear the noise from the strip, on the 28TH FLOOR. it is the highest floor in the entire hotel and yet i can still hear the ambulances, music, people, and the freakin helicopter that passes every 30 minutes to land at McCarren airport which is down the street a quarter mile. RICIDICULOUS.. . update: since starting the yelp review, 4 helicopters have passed and its 9:31 am hahahahhahaa wow. . . also, as you can see, they put promotional posters on the outside windows, that seriously hurt your eyes/ block the strip view if your trying to look at it. LOL SO MUCH FOR THE STRIP VIEW. MY EYES WOULD HURT WHEN I TRIED TO LOOK! . . also, the previous reviews are correct about it being mostly loud, obnoxious college students and it being a frat hotel more than an actuall, RELAXING vacation.. . i have never had a more horrible time in the Vegas than staying at the MGM. i knew i should have stayed with my normal hotels when i come here, Venetian, Aria, and The Hotel, or now as it is called, Delano. i cant wait to come back and avoid the MGM next time. . . basically if your looking to not sleep and you dont like to be in your hotel room, MGM is the place to stay. LOL
This hotel is very nice except for the walls are very thin.  You can here the people in the next room or walking down the hallway.  Even on a high floor you can hear noise from the strip, sirens, etc. Also the blind wouldn't come down and the sun was coming in heating up the room , I called the front desk, they said they would have someone up right away.  An hour later still nothing.  I called back down and they said they wouldn't be able to give me an estimate of how long it would take to get someone there to fix it. So meanwhile we decided to use the hot tub (we had the spa suite) and while we were in the hot tub the maintenance guy just walked in on us (despite the fact that we had the do not disturb sign on the door). Then the air conditioning went out(mid day in Sept.  100 +) they did come up to fix it..OVER AN HOUR LATER!! They never apologized or tried to compensate us in any way.  When we checked out we told them about the inconvenience and the guy reluctantly said "well I guess I can refund your $20 resort fee" I will not be staying here again!
The new rooms are nice, simple and straight to the point. Not extremely luxurious but still nice and comfy. The hotel also has a lot of restaurants and things to do and see like the tigers, and KA which I loved by the way! I might try staying at this hotel next time I am in Vegas because it's in the middle of the strip and is easily accessible from other areas of the strip.
This review is specifically targeted for the Stay Well portion. The hotel was so dirty when we first walked in. The trash was filled, the bed was unmade with hairs everywhere on white sheets, the bathroom was strewn with dirty towels and there were pillows everywhere on the floor. It is so disappointing to walk into a room and seeing this. I will never ever stay here or at the regular MGM again. I will be posting pictures on here just so everyone can see how gross it was! The whole process of changing rooms took 45 minutes. Unfortunately this hindered our plans for the night and we ultimately had to cancel. They moved us to a room facing the Hooters hotel/airport and all we could hear were airplanes taking off all night. I specifically wanted to stay at the Stay Well part of the hotel but I will never again stay at any MGM affiliation. You will be disappointed. It's not even worth the extra money.
OK rooms, a bit smaller then most hotels. The service is terrible!! We called ahead of time to ask if the have mini fridges in the rooms. They said yes, so we book it. Come here and see here isn't. We go downstairs and rudely the man said uhh no the cheap rooms don't have mini fridges- the expensive ones do. I didn't know that MGM is cheap in general? Huh, okay then! . The pool is over crowded and it's really small considering the size of the hotel. There are 3 pools- 1 is river rafting which you have to rent, the others are two small pools that is overcrowded. Also the food, and drinks here at the stores are crazy prices!! 5$ for 1 bottle of soda??? Are you kidding me, this isn't an island where you expect it to be really expensive. Overall I did not enjoy this hotel- the riviera monocoa suites are better then here. This was first time at MGM and I am not happy about the service and hotel here. I will be giving my complaint to management here.
Hotel room is ok for a Las Vegas hotel. The hotel itself looks nice. Most people in their 20s and 30s staying here. . . First room we went to had used soap, half a roll of toilet paper, and half bag of nuts on the counter. Went back down and was given a new room immediately.
I'm changing my review from 1 star to 3 because of Alice. She saw my Yelp review and gave me a call to discuss my experience. She was really sweet and professional about the situation, even offering us KA tickets! The show was awesome and even though we couldn't see Atmosphere at the Brooklyn Bowl (our original plans that got delayed because of switching rooms), my boyfriend and I really appreciated it. 5 stars for Alice, 3 stars for the hotel room and 1 star for the inconvenience. Thank you again Alice!
MGM Grand is a seriously huge hotel. So big that we never really knew our way around after 3 days. So many entrances and 5000 rooms makes this place seem overwhelming. However they somehow make it tolerable with responsive staff and plenty of them. Overall the hotel rooms are lovely and the staff responds quickly. We called to have a lightbulb replaced in our room and they were there within the hour (though this should have been noticed and called in by the cleaning staff before we got the room.) We didn't like to gamble in the casino due to high min bets and the EXTREMELY smokey and crowded environment. There are lots of shops and restaurants though so the selection is plentiful. I would stay here again, but would prefer a hotel slightly less smokey, more intimate, and more navigable (my eyes were red from the smoke downstairs). Also, it's a hike to get out to the strip since MGM is on the far end.
Thanks for the room upgrade! We were originally placed in the old west tower but after our group showed up, we were moved to the Grand Tower side which was supposedly newer, upgraded and nicer. Yes, it was newer and nicer on the Grand side. . . Pros: Nice employees, nice rooms (loved their double automatic window shades; no sun light comes into the room in the mornings), tons of fast food and sit down restaurants, nice pools (salt water pool too), a friendly crowd/patrons at MGM, easy access from Las Vegas Blvd and to and from the I-15. Easy check out. Free fast wifi in your room. . . Cons: SLOW, VERY SLOW, valet parking. Even though I called down from my room, it still took 15 minutes after I checked in downstairs. . . Like any decent Vegas resort hotel, MGM is nice. Decent rates, they have special events there as well. MGM is a big property.
Stayed on 9/4/14 for family gathering.  Got a great deal on Hotels . com and got room upgrade for using my Amex.  Room was nice, hotel staff was informative and I cant wait to return for a longer stay.  This also is an apparent magnet for the young and drunk as they seem to be everywhere you look.
It's a shame that we had a lovely stay here and I have to give only two stars. I paid in advance with a Groupon Getaway which seemed like a great deal at the time. With tax, etc. I paid around $72 for what was a very nice room. Upon checking in I was told that I would be additionally charged a $25 resort fee (no problem) and that a $100 deposit would be put on my card and returned on checkout. Instead, two days after I checked out I got hit with a $150 charge. I called their "Billing Inquiries" number about six times. Every time, I painstakingly entered all of my information into an automated system and was then immediately disconnected every single time. A call to their customer service line was not helpful.. Besides, they don't even have the lions anymore.
Staying here currently and I want to throw up. I don't smoke, got a non smoking room and I smell smoke constantly.  Called down to the desk and Pam sends someone up to 'spray'. Spray what your ventilation system is OLD. You really need to take a whiff. . Next time we will give our business to Vdara who I'm sure will gladly take our business and accommodate us accordingly - non smoking.  I explained that my husband has asthma and we have both woken each day with a headache. . This place sucks. Vdara or Trump here we come.
The rooms we check-in had dirty smell sock left from a previous guess. Bathroom was dirty, toilet had piss stain on the seat and hair in the sink. Another room had a glass with water and lip stain on it. Horrible service... everyone seem to be in a bad mood. They were very rude. NEVER coming back here again.
This review is for the awesome room service we received during labor day weekend. We were so exhausted from being out morning till late night, we decided to order room service and chill in the room. . We ordered around 9:30pm, they said it would take about 40 mins, which was fine. We were prepartying before dinner anyways, lol. . We ordered couple of burgers, I ordered chicken, shrimp, & steak pho, onion rings, fries, & buffalo wings. I was so surprise at how good the food was, my pho was so good, it came with all the veggie toppers. Everyone said their burgers were so juicy and perfectly cooked. The onion rings were sooooo good and the fries perfect too!! In addition, our room service person said they were out of pitchers for water, so he brought us 5 large bottles of Fiji water, and 6 beautifully decorated chocolate covered strawberries. Great job on the room service MGM!!
I booked a room this weekend with the MGM because I purchased tickets to watch the Mayweather fight however I was very disappointed upon entering the room because it seemed like no one had cleaned it. Yes sheets were made, however there was forks on the floor, a small bottle of baby oil, and other items. That's gross.
Las Vegas is the capital of the hospitality industry. I used to be in the hospitality industry, so when I go to Las Vegas I am eager to be wowed, but my expectations are reasonable because I also understand the restrictions that establishments have. . . So this review is as fair as it gets. . . Short version of this review: . . 1. Unbearable pulsing hum outside my room kept me up all night. . 2. Food made me throw up in the morning. . 3. What looked like blood spots on my friend's sheets grossed us out. (We later found out this was from the rust in the driers. Doesn't matter, fix it, get on top of your game!) . 4. No compensation for any of this, no recovery on the part of the establishment. . 5. STILL CHARGED ME FOR THE FOOD THAT MADE ME THROW UP AND MISS HALF OF MY CLASSES FROM MY CONVENTION! WHAT?! Yup, that's MGM, I guess. . . Long Version:. . My experience at the MGM grand was not only a disappointment, it was appalling. Worst of all, MGM knew about my issues and DIDN'T OFFER ME A THING to compensate for this. In the hospitality industry, we call this part the "recovery"...it would appear the MGM Grand Hotel and casino has never even heard of this concept. . . I was in Vegas for a convention for which I paid a pretty penny. I got to my hotel and the check in desk people were VERY pleasant. I then got to my room and prepared for a restful night after a long drive...NOPE, sorry, a nonstop pulsing hum coming from god knows where kept me up. I slept two hours. . . The following day I slept 4 hours, but the hum was gone, so this time it could be the copious amounts of oxygen pumped into my room to keep me up and gambling. . . But the worst part was this: I ordered some room service after not eating at all for 12 hours. The guy who delivered it was AWESOME too. Great guy, got a great tip. The following morning, after sleeping 6 hours in two nights, I wake up at 6am with a migraine and nausea. I threw up my entire meal. Being sick, I also missed 2 invaluable classes that I can never get back. MGM COST ME MONEY AND KNOWLEDGE! . . I reported this, a gentlemen came and got my information and details of the incident. I assumed this would allow them to make things right. But no. My food was on my bill upon check out and I insisted that they remove it. They did so without hesitation, but then the food showed up on my credit card bill! WHAT!? I couldn't even help them recover myself??? . . A lady got back to me a week later telling me she investigated my incident. She said no other reports were made about the salmon that night, basically subtly suggesting that it was something else despite knowing I hadn't eaten anything before their meal. But here's the thing, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF NO ONE ELSE GOT ILL, I did! No one else getting ill only shows that the salmon wasn't stored improperly, but it could still be prepared improperly as surfaces and utensils can affect the salmon in a case by case basis. . . My friend also had some gross spots in his room after waiting 30 minutes for his room to be ready. He said they looked like blood. Later, it was explained that the spots are rust from the dryers. That's not an excuse, fix this! . . The staff was very pleasant at MGM which earns them 2 stars. But if you're in the capital of the hospitality industry, act the part.
This is a really nice hotel overall. The rooms are nice and comfy. The facility is like a small city and you have a myriad of food and entertainment options here. You could really stay here for a few days and not leave and be pleasantly entertained.
I am not a big gambler but if I were this place would have been a paradise. It is huge! Someone told me that it would take us 20 minutes to get to our car from our hotel room; they were not exaggerating. The hotel itself was very clean and there was more than enough staff to accommodate the amount of guests. Our room, I believe, was in the newer section; the room itself was a very modern design and very clean. I have one complaint, the hour we had to wait just to check in. The check in desk was huge and the line was moving, there are just that many people in this place. The monorail does come to this hotel, which is convenient, just keep in mind you will have to walk a bit to get to it. The hotel itself needs a monorail. A little too big for my taste but I would probably stay again if the price were right. If you have no issues getting a little exercise just to get to the front door, or getting lost in a maze of unlimited slot machines you will probably love this place.. . Room Tip: the newer rooms are a very modern design unlike the basic hotel room.
I absolutely love this hotel! Our room is modern and comfortable, the pool is huge, and there are so many dining options you never have to leave!
Long, overdue review. Been here many times, keep coming back. Excellent location, to airport and everything. It is a huge resort, always busy, but very convenient. Old school, just the way I like it. And the casino hits. The rooms in the West Wing are small, reimincent of NYC, but who hangs in the room? Prefer a room off the main casino, but love a good deal and updated rooms. Oh, the pools are fabulous. You could get lost here for weeks. Always look forward to Vegas and The MGM.
"Ronnie" the Seacrest looking douche at the front desk was a prick.
I stayed at the Skyline Marquee Suite, beautiful two bedroom suite with a breathtaking view of the city. Although I was a VIP member, the staff were rude and impatient. I noticed that in general, the staff were not very courteous to the other guests as well. . . If MGM wants to compete with the many other hotels in Vegas, they need to train their staff to have more class.. Especially to their invited guests and VIP members.
The newer part of the hotel is very swanky. Great concierge service, super knowledgeable about events and best places for dining and entertainment.. . Room service and housekeeping get thumbs up too.. . Wet Republic! Holy bananas! it's a lot of fun!. . Great weekend for sure.
really nice service.  i felt like a high roller when i asked questions.    my only complaint was that the whisky bar (whisky down) was a little pricy and couldn't make a sazarac which is my favorite whisky cocktail. (and the first cocktail created in america)
1st time staying at the MGM - wouldn't have picked it, but MyVegas gave me a comp, and we upgraded to the Spa Suite...so glad we did... The room was big, comfy bed, awesome hot tub.  My only draw back was the shower ran out of hot water in just a couple of minutes, which was odd because the hot tub stayed as hot as you would want it... . This casino is huge, lots to play, close to the monorail - which I love, and has lots of eateries.  . Favorite part of the trip, looking out our window from the 10th floor into a back alley... saw a suv limo pull up and a cop on a bike block the alley... and guess who gets ushered in pretty quickly - Taylor Swift... nice :)
Pros: Nice rooms, great pools, good service. Cons: Long lines for everything, a loooong walkto get anywhere in the resort, and it's designed to separate you from as much as your money as possible as quickly as possible. Example: There are no water fountains to be found anywhere on the property, and they charge five bucks for a bottle of water. May be a great place if you have way too much money and don't know what to do with it.
Wonderful but such a fat walk to everywhere.  The suite was amazing,   The service was 5., even the maids were nice.   A few small problem in our room like blinds,  etc but they were repaired immediately.  We will stay there again.  I'm trying to plan my next trip now.
The overall experience was great but I did leave my watch there and the manager Jamila or however it is spelled refused to send me my watch back free of charge and even asked me "now why would we do that" and I just thought that maybe since we spent the weekend at the MGM (3 rooms) pool parties, the fight, the clubs that out of courtesy MGM would pay the $12 it would cost to send me my watch free of charge but no. Its all about money and I will be taking my business to Luxor from now on! Thanks Jamila
Very disappointed in their customer service! My wife and I are scheduled to stay at the mgm this weekend to see a concert at their venue. (The reason we chose mgm in the first place). Well the concert was moved to an outdoor beer fest. . Trying to get ahold of any customer service to question why the concert was moved and why the tickets I purchased for $85 dollars are now equal to a $60 general admission ticket has been unsuccessful. So in attempt to talk to any human I called the reservation number and was greeted by a woman who was very short and unfriendly, in fact down right rude and was unwilling to transfer me or answer any questions I had. . We will be staying at the mgm this weekend  but only because it is too late to change hotels. Needless to say we will not be spending/gambling any money there!
I've stayed here several times over the years, but I was disappointed with this last stay this past week. I was expecting to get a room of similar quality I've always had before, since I booked the same type of room all the time. I was excited before I got here because of past experience and how nice everyone and everything was. The room I got this last time was much smaller and although there was a complete renovation of all the rooms done, this room felt cramped and fragile. The glass doors were not lined up exactly, so if you closed the door to the toilet, it would rub the contact area with the hinge, which was also glass. I understand modern design, but it just seemed really cramped. In addition, you would think with the room renovations done, they would have thought to upgrade the cardio room to an actual fitness center. The ridiculous $28 resort fee is not justified by providing wifi and access to this cardio room with only a few machines working and almost as many not working. Before the renovation, you at least got a daily newspaper and printing services for certain items.
The staff is rude.    Amenities dated.     Much Better options available.  Staff is Unwilling to help, especially the front desk.   Rooms are dirty.   Avoid.
One of my favorite hotels on the strip, and it's a CLASSIC.. . Huge lobby where you can take a picture with their iconic golden lion, but the real magic is in the casino! Who comes to Vegas and doesn't hit up the casino at least once. I love playing here. The dealers are all really nice and friendly.. . The rooms are nice and clean, and the hotel service is superior to most hotels out there.. . MGM might actually pass for my FAVORITE hotel!
I have stayed here 3 times and have always had a great overall experience. Good deals on rates with Mlife promotions. Rooms have always been impeccably clean. Great service from all employees. Check in line looks long but moves well. Monorail station is one of the closest to the hotel out of all of the stops. I am a roulette player, and this is one of the only places on the strip where you can find European roulette (single zero and only half-loss on even money bets if it hits zero) for $25 minimum at non-peak times.. . Only downsides:. Valet parking is a bit slow when picking up, especially in the mornings. Plan on 15-20 minutes of waiting after handing in your ticket at the counter to be safe.. . West Tower rooms are small and are really best for solo travelers or couples who are going to spend almost no time in the room. My understanding is that this was the original hotel tower from the 1970s (although 100% updated now) and the rest of the complex was built around it.
Before arriving, I read a lot of negative reviews about the MGM grand and made me extremely nervous. Luckily, there were not any issues and we both enjoyed our stay :) . . Checking in? We arrived at 930am our room was ready but check in wasn't until 3pm so we paid an extra $20 and got our room key right away..so worth it! . . Grand King room? Our view was incredible! The windows were 'about' ceiling to floor length. The room was very clean and trust me, I checked everything after some of the reviews I read! All the amenities were up to date although I was disappointed there wasn't an ihome in every room. . . Pool? It's massive. There are a lot of locations to choose from which means a lot of chairs but 1pm on a nice day they will still all be taken! Alcoholic drinks are way overpriced with not enough alcohol, wouldn't recommend buying them. . . Location? Yes, it is at the far end of the strip but there is a monorail close by that is extremely convenient :)
