This place is overrated. We got bennidits, which were all right, nothing special. Potatoes were too salty. . . Their ice tea was terrible, you can taste they used tap water to make it, which was disgusting!!!. . We will not come back for sure
Took my sister and nephews for the first time they loved it. Great service great food our server Alyssa was excellent. We will be coming back every time I visit Vegas.
I always enjoy coming here. Thaynara was very pleasant and quick to my table. I had a great western omelet. This is one of my favorite breakfast places in town.
The wait wasn't too long even though it was prime breakfast time. The customer service was excellent! It seems that they're very service oriented. The banana muffins were delicious and good equality coffee. I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes because of my dire sweet tooth and I can say, it was a good choice. They were very rich I couldn't finish my food. I had some Portuguese sausage and it was a great balance. Nice and juicy. I'm coming back here.
My server Alyssa was amazing. Very kind,always had a smile on her face and made sure everything was good with us. Also her manager Marc was amazing and making sure we enjoyed our service. I will definitely be returning and telling my friends about the wonderful service and food.
The food here is amazing! I had the tuna melt and felt like I was chewing on heaven! Our server, Lindsay was so sweet and personable. I really liked her! Great service and great food!!
This restaurant really does not live up to all of its fabulous reviews. The service was very slow and the waitress with colorful hair  ignored us when we told her we were not satisfied with our food. Our orders did not come with all of their sides and they ignored our complaints about that. Also, the toast was burnt and they tried to hide that by placing the burnt sides on top of each other. I will never come back here. Rude staff and terrible service!!!!!!!!
We came in the morning for breakfast and we've been coming here for the last 3 years. We can't miss it when we come to town and every time the service is fantastic! . This place isn't very big and it gets crowded on weekends. We arrived at about 10:30 on a Saturday morning, but we only waited 15 minutes for a table. Our food came out faster and we were in and out in a little over an hour including great conversation.. Before our food came to the table, our server, Stacy, introduced herself and brought us the delicious banana bread muffins with butter. . I ordered the eggs Benedict and some orange juice. The hollandaise sauce was creamy and not too thick. The eggs were perfectly poached. Together with the Canadian bacon, everything was well balanced. Sometimes, if the hollandaise sauce is over seasoned, the combination of the hollandaise with Canadian bacon leaves the dish too salty. That definitely wasn't the case here.. Throughout our meal, Stacy was fantastic. She kept checking on us. At one point I needed an additional napkin and was about to flip the egg when the manager walked up to ask what we needed. Although Stacy did bring the check a little early, she apologized, ensured us that there was no rush and brought me the additional orange juice I wanted to order.. When we were done, one of the other servers noticed my injury and offered to help me up. I really appreciated her concern. This place is great!
Got the stuffed french toast with the banana muffin and it was SO GOOD ashley was our server and she was the best waitress ive ever had IN MY LIFE
What an awesome place. . . First off, they give you a complementary banana nut muffin when you order your breakfast and it is SO GOOD. It's always warm and always fresh. It's a dream come true for your taste buds. My mouth is watering right now, no joke. . . The omlettes are delicious and they are very generously sized. The french fries rock. . . The french toast is amazing too! . . I've been here a bunch of times and I look forward to going back.
I have been coming to Las Vegas for YEARS! My father moved to Las Vegas almost 20 years ago. The one place that is MUST for us to go to for an amazing breakfast is the Egg & I restaurant. . . This last visit was no exception to any of the past visits. The food was so fantastic. The options were endless. Who knew you could prepare eggs so many delicious and wonderful ways?. . Lindsay our waitress was very friendly and helpful. We brought our youngest son on this trip (for his 21st birthday) and he was having a hard time making a selection. Lindsay took the time to answer all of his questions and gave him a great recommendation of the country fried skillet. He LOVED IT!!! Thank you LIndsay!. . All I can say is - if there is a line or a wait (and there most likely will be) then take the time because it is worth it. The coffee is fresh and hot and the banana nut muffins are a MUST (unless you are allergic of course).. . We only waited about 15 minutes and our food was on the table - pipping hot. I ordered my favorite - the Greek scramble. FOUR eggs, chicken, spinach, mushrooms,and feta cheese make up this belly busting breakfast. It is served with choice of toast or muffin (I got the muffin) and breakfast potatoes. . . My hubby ordered the Chili omllete and he had a choice of chili's. His came with the same sides only he ordered toast instead of a muffin. I have no idea why because that muffin is served warm with butter. YUM!!!. . Cost is a little higher than say a Perkins or iHop - but the food is SO much better! Expect to pay about $ 15 per person including a beverage. Serving size is SO BIG that you could almost split something and share.
Our server was Lilliana, she provided excellent service, and the food was also excellent!! Highly recommend you try this place!
Another great meal at The Egg and I. Always great food, fast service & very nice wait staff. Thaynara helped me today and she was fantastic!
First I think most of the bad time was due to our waitress Ashley. She had a bad attitude from the start and was more than slow. I tried to order a mimosa which I was then told that even though it's on the menu they don't have them. Ashley took offense to that as well. It took a while to get our sodas, she never came back for refills. After a bit she came to take our order and didn't get that right either. My sister ordered a burger with a muffin as an appetizer,  the muffin never came. I ordered a pesto veggie sandwich (came out without pesto) but Ashley didn't know that because she never checked on our food once it cane out. My mom asked 3 people for mustard, by the time she got it her burger was cold. Overall less than happy with the experience. Cheers, hope yours is better than ours.
Good sized pancakes. That's all that I was really happy about. Now the bad, It's sad that they don't carry regular shredded hash browns they have mcdonalds look a like hash browns. It was very disappointing. But the service was the worst of all. I'm not picky what so ever. But our waitress named Ashley was terrible. She brought me a coffee never brought a spoon, didn't get one till the end of my meal and not even by our waitress. She was rude from the beginning. I will not recommend this place nor will I be back. If you want a great place to go have breakfast I recommend Mr. Mamas where you can have great food and friendly service!
Our server Arlene was eggceptional!! And my haole loco moco was so so good. Reminded me of Oahu!  Thank you for a great experience!
Yes, being in Vegas you would think the best places to eat would be on the famous strip. However, I've found that the restaurants worth pilgrimaging to are actually on the outskirts of the strip! I can't help it, I like to eat like a local. Being a breakfast/brunch fanatic I figured I'd look to Yelp to find a breakfast spot with big portions that won't break the wallet! I found Egg & I as one of the best places to go to for brunch so I thought I'd give it a shot. . . The ambiance has a small-town diner feel to it which I loved! The menu had way too many amazing options which made it difficult to decide what to eat. I chose to get the eggs benedict while the boyfriend had the country benny, both which were AMAZING! The portions were huge, the gravy is perfectly made, the banana nut muffin is to die for, and the staff is always friendly and pleasant. Now this is our "go to" brunch place to eat on Sundays before we make the long trek back to California. This place is a MUST!
Amazing Amanda at the East Sahara ...This place scores 5 stars on every count and Amanda deserves 100!
Good food for a good price! This would be 4 stars if we hadn't waited 10 min before even getting our drink order in.
Maybe my expectations were high due to all the great yelp reviews, but I found my experience disappointing. The restaurant was very crowded and noisy which isn't conductive to a pleasant experience. Our waitress delivered our food quickly, but my muffin was mostly cold and the food was rather plain. We also agreed the potatoes were way too salty. Overall I wish I had just stayed on the strip.
This place is amazing. Loved the food.  The banana nut muffin is a must try. Carole Ann was awesome. We had 13 people in our group and the service was still amazing.
Very good breakfast spot.  Karla our waitress was sweet and attentive.  She brought out a sample of both of the chili for my friend to try.  Now that's good service. Friendly staff!
The food here is amazing! Almost as great as Amanda's service! Highly recommend this place to everyone! Had the Country Benny- ermahgawd. So delicious!
The food here is on point! Also the service that we got from Amanda was incredible! I had the bacon and sliced avocado omelette which was the best omelette I've ever had. Check this place out!
I wish I came here with a group of 10 people so I can make everyone order a different dish for me to try. I can eat eggs everyday and every meal and not get sick of it. So Egg and I pretty much describes the story of my life. This place is roughly 10-15 mins away from the strip so there was no wait like all the other crazy famous Vegas brunch spots and that's 10 extra bonus points!. . Like I mentioned I'm a crazy egg person so ordering brunch was never difficult for me. I would always always ALWAYS order an omelette but no joke, it took me more than 10 mins to decide what I wanted here since almost everything had eggs in it and there were so many choices! But of course i ended up getting the work omelette and we also ordered carnitas something (I was so hungry and forgot to note the name). The omelette was okay nothing special or different for everywhere else but the potato on the side was AMAZING! The other dish was also super good- I've never had carne asada that's so flavorful and delicious! I cannot wait to come back again and trythe other dishes they have!. . Oh did I mention, instead of stretching your neck out to track down your waiter/waitress, you can flip the "egg sign" and someone will swing by to attend to your needs. Awesome!
This is a great place for brunch!  Excellent food,l and large-generous portions.  I would have given 5-stars however, we didn't get refills on our water and had to ask a couple of times for our half and half for coffee.  Excluding those two minor issues, it was great!
