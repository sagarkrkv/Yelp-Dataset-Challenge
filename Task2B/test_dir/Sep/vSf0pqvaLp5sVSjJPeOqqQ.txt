I love this place!! Ask for Melissa. What a sweet heart!! From the bologna sandwich to the yummy brunch food. I have never had a bad meal or drink at this place.
What a great place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The beer list is extensive and amazing!  There is something on there for everyone, whether or not you are a beer lover.  The food is equally amazing- the steamed mussels are one of my favorites.  It's a fun, energetic atmosphere.  I always make sure to hit this place up whenever I am in town.
At first, I thought Todd's PUB was part of Aria hotel but then I later realized it's actually located inside the Crystals Mall.. . We were craving some good lunch pub food so why not go to a pub?! I've heard so much about the 7 second beer challenge that I was hoping on our visit to see some thirsty challengers.. . No challenges happened but we did order some food. Even on a lunch, the restaurant is pretty packed but we only waited a couple of minutes to get our table ready. Upon suggestion, I decided to try their lobster roll whole the bf ordered their fish and chips.. . When they say fish and chips, literally expect A FISH and some chips. Granted it was a huge piece of deep fries fish, but it was kinda sad to see just one fish on the plate. The fish and chips were good. But nothing too spectacular. I thoroughly enjoyed the lobster roll. I thought t was way worth getting the lobster roll than the fish and chips. You get 3 mini rolls with some cole slaw and chips. The lobster roll had some food chunks of lobster in them as well. . . We left full and satisfied. Will we come back again? Maybe. It's a little on the pricier side. For 2 lunch entrees and 2 drinks it came out to be about $80+ for the 2 of us. But then again, it's Vegas so what do you expect right?
Had a great time at TE PUB.   Yelp has this listed as 2$$ and I don't know that I agree with that.  Prices seemed a little higher to me.  I had a group of four.   I had the fish & Chips, the husband had the Chicken wings and my friends shared a fish and chips order.  We also started with the pretzels.. . First, the pretzels effing rocked.  SO freaking good and came with cheese sauce for dipping.   Then the fish and chips were delish.  I found it weird that the cole slaw was full of peas, but it was tasty when the peas were pushed out of the dish.  The fish and chips, including the dip[ping sauces ROCKED.   My husband's wings were good.  The best part was our server was fab.  He had it all down and we dug the service.  I think the only thing that was king of a bummer was this place is pricey.  I mean, really, $14 for ONE bottle of Stone IPA????  So not cool.  But, got a free Bud Light for checking in on Yelp... my husband drank it.  Wondered who would take that bullet!. . Oh, but LOVED my drink.  Think it was called barreled mule... a whiskey Mule.  YES!. . And, it is VERY loud here.  VERY LOUD.
One of the worst restaurant experiences I've had. We show up with a party of five. We are told that 5 cannot be accommodated due to reservations. We ask if a chair can be brought to a table of 4 which they offer to us (still have a party of 5) and they can't do it. The whole time the young hostess clearly is frustrated with her day and giving us attitude the while time. We tell her we will walk to the bar and find seats. We find 3 and are told after sitting/sanding there for 3 minutes that it is a service well and we will not be served if we sit there.. . At this point we find another 3 chairs with 2 other guests leaving shortly.  3 of us sit, stand and hostess now returns to us and offers us one of the "draft tables." But she says if we sit here we cannot be served by the restaurant and would need to place and retrieve our orders from the bar.  We continue to sit at the bar and after a few minutes a bartender takes out order. 2 guys order one of which gets an incorrect beer order.  I ask for a delirium and I am told they are out.  I then ask about the "7 second challenge." Our bartender says, "u don't want that now just order a drink." I decline and say I want the 7 second and ask what beers are available, she mumbles the beers and walks away.  5 minutes goes by and she returns, I ask which beers again and I hear the list. She says Boddingtons is the best. I refuse telling her I want PBR. She walks away again and returns in 5 minutes.  My party proceeds to order food which she gives us a confused look and says I thought you guys only wanted beer and then gripes about having to split the check.  She asks me again what I want to order and I say the seven second challenge, she returns with a Boddingtons and tells me to wait for her return. I examine the beer, see it's not PBR and wait for her return again. 7 minutes goes by and she returns. At this point I'm furious with the horrid service and attitude from all their staff. She insists I ordered Boddingtons. At this point I walk out due to total incompetence by the staff there.  Very rude, disrespectful and clearly doesn't care what the customer wants. Never go there again.
I would have given this place 4 stars but because of some of the staff, i have to give it 2. My girlfriend and I went in last night and have to say that aside from some of the staff behind the bar, everything was exceptional. We went in for their late night happy hour. My lady got a Firestone double jack and I ordered the parabola bottle. Needless to say the beers were great. Our bartender asked us if we wanted any happy hour foods, we told her to just let us know when the kitchen was going to close in case we got hungry. She was probably one of the happier of the bunch. I think her name was Brenda? Either way she made us feel super confortable with all the tention going on behind the bar. The little bartender in the service well kept complaining about a lot of things and kind of made us uncomfortable, and the taller lady was really loud and off putting. I guess something happened on the other side and both made it very obvious that they weren't happy about it. Brenda tried her best to make sure we were having a good time despite all the negativity. She even gave us some to go waters for our walk back to the Paris. Other than those two ladies, it's an awesome place for great beers at great prices during happy hour. Next time we'll grab some food.
A few years back my Vegas group did a Pub themed Vegas weekend, hitting both Todd English's and Gordon Ramsey's -  Todd English was by far the best... So, we Took a group of 15 for my daughter's 21st b-day (including 4 21 year-olds, 2 18 year olds, and 2 70 year old grandparents with food allergies, and demanding expectations).  . . I worked with Carol to reserve the table, since it was a large group, and everything went smoothly over email.  My only request was that we have a great server, and Steve did not disappoint.  When we arrived, the table was ready, and Steve introduced himself to me, confirmed that he was aware of the allergies, and assured me that he would take care of everything.  Drinks were ordered, and the best appetizer ever - junk chips arrived.  Everyone's meals arrived in sync and hot, and everyone loved their food. . . And, even though the 21 year olds could not hang with the 45 year old dad when it came to the 7 second challenge, a great time was had by all.. . Thank you Carol for organizing a great night!
My husband and I enjoyed this place. I ordered the Lobster roll of course and it was real fresh. I don't like cole slaw at all..but Todd's Cole Slaw is so good.. Again fresh.. My husband got the happy hour oysters and buffalo wings..  He was surprise how everything was so fresh a super good.. He got a second round of oysters and wings.. Our sever Aaron is so nice and patient with us he gave us great recommendation specially  white wine sangria .. So good..
I have come to realize that almost every single one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas is a Todd English establishment.  None disappoint and PUB is no different.  We actually went back a second time during our trip; it was just that good.  The duck buns and soft pretzels with "wiz wiz" are winners on the app menu.  For entree's the lobster rolls, Rotisserie sliced beef sandwich, sliders and grilled cheese sandwich (with brie and bacon...yum) are all winners.  Service was okay but not great.  However, the huge beer selection with everything from PBR on tap to rare Trappist Ales combined with the great food more than made up for anything lacking in that area.  Bottom line, it is worth a try, maybe even 2:)
Definitely an interesting megaresort type of take on an English pub. . . It's a bit too huge to feel pubby, but it has a fairly exhaustive beer list and a lot of delicious food to pick from. Started out with some east coast oysters and had bangers and mash for an entree. Oh how I'm a sucker for bangers and mash, and these ones didn't disappoint. . . 3 stars because although this is a solid place, nothing particularly stood out enough to make me want to go out of my way to eat here again.
Great service great food. Try the lobster rolls and the wedge salad. Jorge the waiter rocks very friendly! Will definitely comeback when we are in Vegas
Way overpriced for what you get.  Check in on Yelp and you get a free bud light, other than that I'd avoid this place.
OHMYGOODNESS!. This place has the best lobster roll I have ever eaten in my whole entire life.. I am from Los Angeles, and let me tell you.. I would drive over to Las Vegas just for the day just to have some of their lobster roll!! . The lobster was cooked perfectly. And the sauce, complimented it so well! And the bread ?! best bread i've ever had.. . DEFINITELY GOING BACK WHENEVER I AM IN VEGAS.
Always make this a must visit when I come to Vegas. Great food. Great beer. Great oysters that are only $2 a piece . . If you are looking for a fun place with a lively crowd but not overwhelming this is a must.   Food is always outstanding
Just OK, nothing special. Overpriced for what you get although they do do some good happy hour deals if you are looking for a cheap bite to eat.. . The service was OK, our server wasn't exactly full of smiles but he was quick in taking our order and clearing away. We also went on a Friday evening and there was plenty of seating available inside.. . I'm glad we wasn't sat near any speakers because the music was blasting out like you wouldn't believe. . . Good selection of beers if that's what you are in to.. . I probably wouldn't visit again as there are better places for better prices on the strip but it was worth a try.
This place is a joke!. . I will be very specific about the issues that I had during my lunch at Mr Todd English's ill attempt at a restaurant:. . We arrived at the restaurant around 2:00pm for lunch. There was no host at the host stand; just a busser standing up front twirling a drink tray on his finger saying "she's gunna be right back."  The hostess known as "she" didn't return to the host stand for several minutes. We were eventually sat at a table when she arrived back at her post.. . We were greeted quickly by our server, Samantha. She was plenty friendly. The issue that I had with her is that she was sitting at a table next to us doing nothing but showing pictures of who knows what to other servers while they neglected their tables, and she neglected hers. I had no refill on my soda.  She didn't check on us after food was received.  The manager did nothing but stand next to the heat lamps and lean the whole time that we were there.. . The $19 hamburger that I received had no seasoning on it and the bun was very dry and stale...huge disappointment. . . Theb $20 sandwich my wife had was good, but really I could have had it for $7 at togo's. . . In conclusion:. . Service: terrible.. . Food: mediocre at best. . . I know that my words will fall on deaf ears, as far as Mr English is concerned, but hopefully the management will try to improve the staff so that people don't continue to leave as pissed off as I did.  . . Don't spend your hard earned money here. You will regret it, as I do!
Watching football with my business partner in Vegas and this had much better fare than the Aria bars. Service was average so docked the rating but the burger and fries were huge and delicious. I tried to finish but was overwhelmed. The meat was thick but cooked med well like I asked and veggies fresh. Of course you'd expect this from a $19 burger but still cheap in Vegas.
Went here today for the first time. I ordered the Bloody Mary and the wilted spinach salad with salmon. The Bloody Mary was tasty but the spinach salad was even better!!
The food was ok.  To be honest if the service hadn't been so bad it probably would have been a 4. However, he was so bloody miserable if we had not ever darkened his door I would hope that he would have been happier.  (He couldn't have been any worse) the hostess was very nice and the bartenders seemed great though.  I wish we had sat there. Oh well.
Ever since I tried their dirty chips, I've been dying to come back and have them again.  It's been a couple years, so sadly we found out they no longer are on the menu.  Tried the Junk Chips instead, along with their prime rib sandwich.  The Junk Chips just don't measure up to what they had with the Dirty Chips.  Too wet and similar to nachos.....please bring back the Dirty Chips!!  Sandwich was delicious!
This is a very fun place, loud and vibrant as you expect in Vegas, a great vibe all around.. . So it's an English style pub this means one important aspect to start out with - beer!  I had the arrogant bastard ale, which for some reason I suspect may have been the wife telling me something subconsciously but it seemed to hit home. Very smooth and refreshing.  The beer was pretty good too!. . The wife had a Bloody Mary chock full of add ons to ensure optimal obnoxiousness was achieved. Cheddar, shrimp, salami, pickled asparagus, old bay seasoning, Worstershire sauce, lime juice, spicy V8 all made full with tomato basil infused Vodka!  A drink as large as a five course meal, whatever next!  Sheloved it.. . Well next in fact was the crispy beer battered pickles as an appetizer.  Appetizer?  This could be a whole meal for 2 on its own!  Great dips with this.  Awesomeness.. . Entree: fish and chips - it's an English pub what else?  Also we shared and good thing, this could feed a family of 4!  Fish, fries, coleslaw as good as it gets - phenomenal.. . Service was also awesome, our server was incredibly friendly and helpful.. . So great place and a well earned 5 stars!
Considering this is on the strip this isn't a bad option for happy hour. Of course, happy hour just knocks the prices down to where they should be in the first place. Their beer selection is extensive and virtually all of it is on happy hour. . . I had the sliders and they were really good. I was actually surprised at how they hit the spot- I guess I didn't expect them to be so big (for a slider). The oysters were just okay but I had to try them since it was happy hour. . . You do have an option to sit outside, which is nice, but there is really no view. It's just for the mere reason of sitting outside.
One of my best Vegas experiences yet  amazing food friendly service we came to watch the 49er game and the atmosphere was perfect
Ordered a Chicken BLT, which was pretty good, although the chicken was a bit overcooked. I sat at the bar and the service was great and super fast.
