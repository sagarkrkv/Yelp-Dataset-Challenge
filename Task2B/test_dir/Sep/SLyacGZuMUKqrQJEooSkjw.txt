Cons:. . *Pretty damn expensive, considering what they offer ($32 for the weekend brunch). *No crab legs . *Food temperatures range from lukewarm to ice cold. *Every meat item was dry as hell. *No crab legs. *Everything tasted pretty bad. *There are better buffets in vegas for under 10 bucks . *IT WAS OVER $30 AND NO CRAB LEGS. . Pros:. . *The line was pretty short (It was almost empty at lunchtime on a saturday, go figure). *They have cotton candy
No snow crab in lunch, everything is bad. No worth for the holiday price $30+ per person.
Check Groupon for great 2 for 1 deals. They come up fairly often.. . The last 3 times I've been in town I also happened to find my way here. The food is good, but I can see why some aren't as thrilled with it as I am. For the regular price, this place is not worth it. However, I've been fortunate to always find a 2 for 1 on Groupon. The last time we went here the Groupon was a 2 for 1 with a bottle of champagne. Not shabby at all.. . When I come here I go for their prime rib which is always exceptionally made. I also like that their crab legs are sliced open so that I don't have to use my crab cracking skills to open my son's & boyfriend's crab legs. More crab time for me! :D. . The desserts are ok. They have a crepe station, but the crepes are pre-made. :/. . This place can get a very long wait line. The first time I was here I waited almost 2 hrs.! That's a bit too long to wait when you're starving. Found out though that you can call and they will let you know over the phone how long the line is so that you don't have to waste your time waiting in line. Why waste your time in line when you can waste your time drinking? You can also waste your time wasting your money. :D
Waitress was amazing. Didn't really eat too much...thankfully because after we were all done, and about to leave, a cockroach was running all over our table. Two waitresses saw it, one caught it with a napkin and disposed of it, kinda seemed like a normal ordeal to them. When there is one, you know there's more. So I'd just be careful if you end up eating there.
Well, I can't imagine the Spice Market Buffet has an overall rating of three stars.  I have three words:  It is great.. . Great selection, very fresh, very good taste on all dishes (and I eat all of the dishes), high quality ingredients, the staff and chefs are very helpful and friendly.  The atmosphere is nice and relaxing.  This is my favorite buffet and beats all others that I have tried, hands down.
Expensive and salty... Nothing was memorable kinda disappointed
This buffet was good. There was great food, and there was meh food. The service was all right, nothing special. The negative was that getting through the line to pay and to a table took forever, and we were the first ones in line! It seems like they were short of staff that day or something. Anyway, I would eat here again, especially if I were staying in the hotel.
We got the 24hr pass for 3 people w/c cost us $210 bucks which is a little pricey for people that don't eat much but worth it if you eat a lot! Foods were okay and VIP service was good. I had warm crab legs straight from their kitchen, Asian foods, salad, and curry. Not something that you can enjoy and savor but fills you up
Pretty good option for lunch buffet (with the buffet pass).
Overall this is just an A-OK buffet on the strip; I truly believe that there is almost always an equal sign (=) in between the quality of food and the price tag. The only one thing I have remembered from this place is the cotton candy while everything else is just average.  I don't think I will come back unless I get to eat here free of charge and do not have to wait in line at all, which is too good to be true, isn't it? teeheee :P. . in brief, I would pay a little bit more for some better buffets nearby.
Went here for the lunch buffet/early dinner last week and overall I was disappointed right from the get go. First of all I waited in line for what seemed forever because the hostess was to busy talking to a co-worker and was actually eating something. Once I got past that I went to the table where it took a good 10 to 15 min for them to bring out a iced tea. As far as the food that I had the crab legs where decent there just wasn't a lot of meat but I expected that for a lunch buffet. However I had to really look around to find anything else that was edible and really didn't have any success. The seafood other than the crab legs and shrimp looked bad. The Italian food looked like it had been sitting all day. The American station wasn't appealing at all. They did have flank steak on the craving station but I didn't try that because I had some kind of other beef from the middle Eastern station and it was really tough. The desserts where awful took a couple and just took a bite and threw them away. Also the whole time I was there nobody came to pick up plates and the whole section I was in was the same way. I think there are better options than eating here and I probably wouldn't go back.
Pros:. - Buffet was located downstairs in the casino (fancy). - Had a wide selection of foods from different places: Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian, American, Asian. - Price was affordable. - Our waiter was very funny and attentive. . Cons:. - Food was a bit too much on the salty side, expected it to be slightly better but that's alright
Skip it, Seriously, even if you have the buffet of buffets pass save that stomach space for elsewhere. While i was here i saw them refilling buffet items from cans. The food that wasn't being refilled looked like it had been sitting out for hours. I tried a few things crab legs, meats, pasta etc. None of it was any good. Meat was dry and the crab legs were still frozen. I eventually gave up on the regular selections and just high tailed it to the desserts, cause those should be good right? Wrong, didn't even finish a cupcake. I went on a weeknight around 8pm. The place was practically empty. In town with so much amazing food i can't think of any reason i would return to this buffet.
One of buffet from buffet of buffet,  get here for breakfast,  they had international choice to choose,  so pick whatever you are in the mood for except for Mexican, soup and salad bars are closed.
Loved this buffet! There was a fantastic spread at Spice Market. Although I do wish there was more variety in the Mexican section. The deserts were awesome! Overall we loved this buffet. We had two Groupons here but were only able to use one (the Lunch buffet with a bottle of wine). Staff was very friendly and attentive. We will totally come back to this spot next time we're in town!
