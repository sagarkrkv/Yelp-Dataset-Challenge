Always elegant and entertaining to stop by this lovely show. It's free and very romantic. Wish they would make the street rats shut up during shows because their yelling "free water" gets annoying, but it's ok. Get a spot early. Shows every 15 or 30 mins depending on the time and day.
Impresionante espectaculo
Beautiful.. . I was lucky enough to be able to watch shows from my room at the Cosmopolitan and also while walking down the strip at night. . . Various songs throughout the ages and a thrill for all ages.  Highly recommend.
Always a must stop when in Vegas. What's not to like about a free fountain show that cannot be compared to any other fountain show.
Great show! Saw the show for the first time and I got chill :) the music is great with all the rhythm of the fountains.  Once every 15 minutes at night time.
Stunning and freaking gorgeous!  And it is free!  Can't get much better than that.  Truly a spectacular thing to see.
Beautiful, gorgeous, you can not get tired of seen this marvelous man made attraction, definitely a most see experience!!!!
I used to LOVE the Bellagio fountains. I took my daughter there this last weekend to see them. I haven't been to see them in a few years. There are two changes that make this only three stars for me.. 1. What exactly is the schedule for the show? The fountains used to go every 15 minutes. This time we got one show in 35 minutes.. 2. Can we get rid of the street "performers" , panhandlers, vagrants, and general nutjobs? Their presence makes a lot of people very uncomfortable. We're there to see real show, not a sideshow.
Reveled in it more than I suspected - diverse choreographed fountain shows with distinctive soundtracks through out evening and nighttime. Saw day and night show.
