It's incredibly sprawled out, not unlike the city of Phoenix. When you land, you taxi for at least 10-15 minutes to find your gate. That being said, this airport offers so much in terms of dining and shopping that I wish I could visit it anytime. Terminal 4 is beautiful but Terminal 2 feels dated and tired. Getting to the airport is very easy with lots of signs and wide streets to get around. The rental car center is new and beautiful and was a pleasure to use.
Hands (or pants) down, this is the best place to poop! Always plenty of toilet paper stocked and the bathrooms smell so fresh! Joyful, joyful!
My best memory of Sky Harbor was flying into PHX from Houston on the famous record breaking 122 degree day back in June 1990. I'd been out here before a few times and this was the final move.. . That day they actually shut down the airport since their temperature charts did not go up that high. They say hot air does not have the same lift and the planes could have trouble taking off and landing. Sounds like a lot of hot air to me.. . It's easy to forget when they were only using terminal 1, 2, 3 and the fancy 4 was still on the drawing board. The airport was pretty outdated and needed a good facelift.. . Sky Harbor has improved significantly over the years and it's really starting to show. The selection of trendy and tasty restaurants has grown to a number that almost gets me excited to go flying again. Nothing like a giant meal to keep you sleeping while you travel.. . Usually fly out of terminal 4 when it's up to me. It is the newest of the bunch and much better than the others. Occasionally we will use terminal 3 when the boss is paying. I think he is a Delta fan or something.. . TSA is about the same as any other airport. Not very friendly and pretty large to say the least. Once had one tell me how great the donuts were nearby and how in 5 minutes he was out of there and on break. Ok ... I know where he is going.. . Get there early and kick back. It is fun to people watch or just play on your phone or tablet. I'm not a big fan of being in a hurry or stressing out. After all the plane could be packed. SNAKES ON A PLANE!. . 4 STARS
Every single crew member I passed from check in to baggage claim asked how I was doing and wished me a good day and happy travels. The agent working the security desk was very funny and inviting and it took the frustration out of the long check in process. Also, a nice selection of restaurants and shops. Bathrooms were clean and there were plenty of outlets to charge my phone. I wouldn't mind flying in or out of this airport again in the future.
I travel weekly and I love this airport. Easy access, a lot if good restaurants if you get stuck, however, it's the hottest, muggiest place in Phoenix! You would think that knowing it's summer and amount of people traveling the climate control would be better. There needs to be an adjustment so that it's not so uncomfortable!
I must say, this is a pleasant airport; the restrooms are clean, the carpets well-kept, and the everything is clearly marked, be it a gate, shop, restaurant, or other amenity.. It's sunny outside, which is to be expected, but the interior is kept at a very reasonable temperature given the city's predilection for obtusely high temperatures and the apparent consensus for air conditioning programmers to attempt to recreate an ice age inside buildings to make up for it. The seats are also quite comfortable; the only thing that it really lacks is more really-accessible power outlets.
I could spend hours just looking around.. . I have many family members and  friends that do quite a bit of traveling. So it's a common occurrence to find myself at Sky Harbor International Airport and that's just fine with me. I could spend hours just looking around Sky Harbor. . . One of the things I like best about Sky Harbor is thier showcasing of local favorite restaurants.  Now when I am at Sky Harbor I can check out restuarants like Cowboy Ciao, Humble Pie, Four Peaks Brewery, Sauce, and  Barrio Cafe.  Gone are the days when you were limited to a small selection of coffee type shops.. .  I actually look forward to going to Sky Harbor because I know I can always grab a bite to eat and a decent glass of wine. Sky Harbor even has a full service Starbucks in the Baggage Claim area.. . The City of Phoenix has also added the light rail which conveniently runs  between Economy parking and T4. The TSA agents are friendly yet professional. If you have to travel Sky Harbor is the Airport to choose.
Neat clean friendly and efficient. Could use more electrical outlets. Good food selections but $$$ prices. Sky train to the lightrail to downtown works perfectly. No need to pay for parking.
I find this airport to be on the 'old look' side, with worn out carpet, lacking style and character and not modernize. I could not find enough outlets to charge my phone, the few available were busy, I just couldnt find many so I had to go and charge my phone at the bathroom. Is like you have to compete with other travelers for something that in other airports is already a given. Food options are good enough, I liked what I saw, especially Humble Pie. Transitions between flights is smooth and everybody is pleasant when you have questions.
Meh. Nothing special. TSA checks were not the best. But what do you expect. The lines were slow. Sunday afternoon and they only had 2 check points open in terminal four. Guess what. One of the scanners broke causing everyone to be corralled like cattle in to one scanner. . . The airport itself is okay. Te rental car place is far. It took me an hour from the time I got off the plane to the time I pulled in to the hotels parking lot. Hotel was only ten minutes away. What's my point. Well it's going to be a while due to the travel required to get your vehicle. Anyways. It's an airport. What do you expect. It's an airport
I dig Sky Harbor Airport! The parking isn't bad and the facility is easy to navigate. They have great cab and shuttle services too. The restaurants they have in the terminals are mostly popular chain restaurants and the pricing is about the same.
Old airport and really confusing to get around in it or around it. There are 4 terminals - and they are all in need of a renovation. Eateries are OK - pretty standard fare. Lack of charging stations is a definite bummer. It's just an old dingy, sticky airport. It just needs some TLC to bring it back.
This is a review of Terminal 4. I fly Southwest, so...well you know.... . Phoenix Sky Harbor is my home airport, so I fly in and out of it on a weekly basis. In comparison to all of the other airports I get to go to, Sky Harbor Terminal 4 ranks pretty high. It is "newer", especially the D Gates, compared to a lot of other airports and well maintained. Here are a few things to note:. . 1. They just recently switched their wifi to Boingo. They still have a complimentary option, so I guess this isn't a big deal. I just cringe whenever I see Boingo hotspots. Maybe because they stole the name of one of my favorite bands from the 80s.. . 2. Power outlets in the Southwest areas are not too plentiful. They have a few pedestals, some with 6 seats, others with no seats, throughout the terminal. I've always found these to be way too small (impossible for 6 people to sit at once) and awkward. They also have a number of choice comfy seats with outlets. I guess I shouldn't be complaining about free power.. . 3. The D gates are by far the smallest, so there is often no wait/very short wait at security. If your flight is going out the C gate, and you have some time but don't like waiting in lines, go through the D gate security checkpoint and walk over. The walk is not that long - Airports are like malls: you know you're going to be doing some walking.. . 4. I travel with a S'well water bottle so I always have water on the plane. Just don't forget to empty it before you go through security. There are a number of water bottle filling stations throughout the terminal. I usually use the one by the women's restroom at the D gates or the one at the beginning of the A gates.. . 5. All of the gates in Terminal 4 connect, but not too easily. It is a U-shape, from the A-D. The A gates and D gates do not connect. It's a pretty ice walk, though - if you have the time. And they also have a lot of moving walkways. And guys with carts.  I use an UP band, so I always appreciate the extra steps ;). . Happy Travels!!!
Very efficient, very convenient to get to and to access your flight. I've flown into Sky Harbor in years past and never had any issues. And with the recent upgrades within the terminals as well as outside of them (i.e, the cell phone waiting areas with flight information), this airport reminds me of another that is pleasant and easy to fly into (Tampa airport).. . Now if only we can get some of the airlines to follow suit. Outside of that, I love, LOVE Phoenix Sky Harbor! Hopefully, so will you.
By far the best Airport in the country. Large enough that you never feel trampled... Clean facilities and smart staff... And the FOOD! This place has a top notch list of non corporate, local favorites!  Say goodbye to the reheated airport pizzas and kitschy convenient store snack foods. You'll be delighted to spend time here before your flight and possibly even when you land... Taking a few extra mins to unwind and freshen up with a delicious plate of food or craft drink
Being that I travel several times a month, convenience is very important.. Their slogan is "America's Friendliest Airport", not sure how that is determined, but I cannot completely disagree.. If flying US Airways out of terminal 4, it's even more convenient.. . I typically park for a day or 2 while I travel, they have the economy east lot either $9 daily uncovered or $11 daily for covered. There is a convenient air train that stops at terminal 4 and leaves every 5 minutes or so. The air train doesn't stop by the checkin counters so you'll have to walk a bit if you need to check any bags. If you're traveling from other terminals, you will have to take an additional - bus - to get to the next terminal. For example, I flew Delta and had to take a inner airport shuttle to terminal 3. These shuttle busses arrive every few minutes but it's still a slight hassle running around.. . Food options at PHX are pretty decent, especially being gluten free. Each terminal and area have different options but always something for any taste.. . At some peak times the airport can get crowded a slightly hectic. At those times, seating can become difficult to find at the gate or at food establishments.. . Overall, I enjoy traveling from PHX, not that I have a choice, but I still like it.
A very clean airport and easy to maneuver around. Decent food choices while in passenger terminals and a few Arizona shops which actually has good pricing for gift items. . . The rental car counter is away from the airport but plenty of free rental car buses to take you directly there. When you return your car, if you rent, you may check in your baggage to be taken directly to the airport (on select airlines). . . I am very impressed with Phoenix airport. You will be too.
I was here yesterday for the first time in several months and they continue to make it better and better. Everyone in security is the nicest, the TSA agent scanning boarding passes even complimented my purse :)) I was through security in 8 minutes (woop woop a new record). . . Andddd best of all how is it every time I am here there is better food? Was I blind last time? But a humble pie and cartel? Come to the airport hungry and thirsty!
I get a very 1980s vibe when I pass through PHX. The dark carpet. The grey/brown buildings. The moving walkways. The boring food choices.. . I wanted food during my layover between SFO and AUS. The options available were forgettable at best. When most people are forced to go to McDonalds, it makes for a very unpleasant plane ride for everyone around them.. . They are in the process of adding a tramway between terminals. That should be a really nice feature once it is completed. I love the train connectors at SFO and DFW.. . Hopefully PHX invests in some modernization.
Rated the friendliest airport! It shows. I've had nothing but good experiences while in the airport. I like that the airport is switching to leasing space to local restaurants. The majority of the restaurants in the airport are (so far) locally owned...outside of Starbucks and a few others. . . I love the sky train that takes you from the light rail and the east economy parking lot to the airport ...for those who want to reduce their carbon imprint or who doesn't want to store their vehicle.
I really like this airport but it may be because Charlotte is my home airport.  What I like is the layout of the various terminals and the fact that there is plenty of space to drop off and pick up passengers.  The rental car center is very modern and organized, and about a 10 minute shuttle ride from the terminals.  Security is efficient and there is a good selection of food once inside.
Omg this airport is always so far from where you land , bad knee had to go all the way too the other side of airport people mover broken hell on the knee!! Always feel dirty here! Oh well last leg home
