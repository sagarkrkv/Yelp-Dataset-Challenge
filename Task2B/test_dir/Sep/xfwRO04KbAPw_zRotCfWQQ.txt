YUM sums it up! We got the chicken and waffles & Andy's sage fried chicken. Both meals were enormous and definitely could be shared. The food was delicious. I loved how well the rosemary was infused into the fried chicken. The only reason I gave it four stars was because of $$ and I also got a blood Mary which was good but lacked salt.
Came here on the hype.  Definitely a good choice for breakfast.  Portions were massive!!!! Went with the chicken and waffles. It was delicious. Fried chicken and bacon filled waffles with fried leek.  I also tried Andy's sage chicken eggs benedict. It had a nice flavor to it. Service was good too.  They were friendly and catering. I do recommend this spot.
we like the food at Hash House, very large portions. Wonderful salads, and my personal favorite are the crab cakes.
Decent food. Known for the portion side. Flavor was alright. With as many spots there are in Vegas, I doubt I'd come back again.
I always take visitors to this place for breakfast purely for the wow factor! The portions are gigantic! Always get the same two entrees. Chicken and waffles and the fried chicken Benedict. 4 people can get full off it. Delicious Everytime!
My husband and I came here to see what the hype is all about.
We picked this place because of all the good reviews.  Maybe the one on the strip is better but this place had a lot of issues.  They could not even cook an egg properly and we had to send that back.   It also took quite a long time to get our food even though we ordered simple things.  My wife ordered eggs and I got the bread pudding.  The table next to us ordered chicken and they got their food before us.  Not sure how you take more time cooking an egg and heating up bread pudding and then messing up both so badly.. . There are a lot better places for breakfast than this one.
The food was fantastic!
Hash House A Go Go is usually pretty good where ever you can find them.  In Vegas, they are a bit more pricey than in San Diego, but about the same quality.  In Vegas, they are bit more "Corporate" but it was a good experience all the way around.  We had to stand in line for awhile to get in, as it is very busy.   Yum.
I recently moved just down the street from what will certainly kill me, Hash House a Go Go. I say kill me because it is very likely I will eat here 2-3 times a day until I literally explode. It's really good. But if I could Tarantino this review and skip backwards in time.... . Chapter 1: The terrible Advice. When I first moved to Vegas in a discussion about food two people who's opinions I value warned me against going to Hash House. Its overrated they said, the food is really bad they said, chicken and waffles is gross they said. Like an IDIOT I listened to them and didnt go to Hash House until my 4th year living here.. . Chapter 2: The house that hash built. . Once I moved to Sahara I thought to myself, "Self, what if they are wrong? What if Hash House is as good as yelpers say? I mean, my friends are idiots, I don't know why I listen to them about anything...". So I decided to try it on a Saturday afternoon. When I walked in the place was packed and I was told at least a 20 minute wait. We were seated in about 5 minutes which is good because after a mere 5 minutes I was ready to murder several customers to eat the food I had seen recently delivered to them. . . Chapter 3: That's a big flapjack. A lot of the reviews discuss portion size, and I'll admit the portions are bonkers- I am a warm blooded American who doesn't quit anything from war to to tee ball games where I'm down 20 runs, but even I had to tap out after eating only 5lbs of my 10lb flapjack. The side of potatoes went largely untouched. All in all I felt a great deal of post eating shame at how much food I had left over, maybe that's just cause I was raised Catholic.  I will say I found it a bit preposterous that when they delivered this 20 inch in diameter flapjack that they gave me approx 1/2 a tea spoon of butter and like 4 ml of syrup. After explaining to the waitress that I was a human man and would be requiring more they brought 2 more little cups... Come on Hash House get it together- the only people who eat pancakes without drowning them in syrup are masochists and the criminally insane. A pancake isn't even really a food- its just a utensil designed to ferry butter and syrup from the plate into my gullet. . . Chapter 4: The Menu. . This was tough. There were at least 10 things i wanted to immediately order but having seen the size of the portions I knew getting 10 entrees would be a tad excessive. This will require future visits to try everything and answer some philosophical questions like what is the difference between a hash and a scramble? How much can I eat before I die like that guy in Seven? How drunk can I get at 10AM on a Tuesday?
The food is just okay, never horrible but never all that great. It is a fun place for a group but it is a tad gimmicky if you ask me.
the best in vegas...glad they opened one in Chicago also.  Just be hungry or expect that 2 people may have to eat one serving.
Um, yeah. This place is pretty amazing. Saw it on Man vs Food, like most people. It's actually different from the impression I got from TV. I thought it was going to be a Rock N Roll kind of atmosphere, but it was pretty quiet during my visit. The food was amazing and the portions are enormous! But, I'm sure you already know that. I could not finish my single flapjack filled with blueberries, it was so huge. I can't describe how crazy good this place is. Just check out all the pictures and get over there for one if the best meals you will ever have!
Food great, service good, two stars for the super loud music that they refused to turn down. Would have been nice to carry on a conversation with out having to yell. Just fyi management, makes it difficult to enjoy a meal when it's not conducive to visit. Which is one of the reasons we as humans go out for food, its a bonding experience,  but not here. More of an eat and get out. Even in the middle of the afternoon when there were maybe 15 diners total.
The portions are enormous! It was a bit of a wait before we could be seated, but it was worth the wait! The food was delicious and far beyond your normal restaurant selections. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable.  . . It's a little pricey, but no more than a night at Outback Steakhouse.
I heard a lot about this breakfast place.  Fun atmosphere, but loud music.  Saturday was comic book character day so the wait staff was dressed as different comic book people.  Fun stuff.  Arriving at 10 am on Saturday was good -  not too long a line.  No reservations.  The presentation of the food was great.  They had very good coffee.  The portions were able to huge.  The biscuits and spinach omlette was good. But the potatoes were bland and lifeless.The sage chicken looked awesome but we didn't try any.  The skillet breakfast at Denny's is just as good or better.  Sorry!
Good food, and huge portions. My wife and I usually split a meal, and the kids (6 & 8) split and have extra. The price is fair, and we have yet to have bad service though when it gets busy, sometimes you have a little lag. Brunch is great. We live in South LV, so all are a drive, but we still go.
Excellent brakefast place. Make sure you get there early or have someone go and put their name down. It gets pretty crazy on weekends.
We had lunch here and everything was FABULOUS...I had the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich, the BEST I have ever had! The owner is from Indiana and truly knows how to fix Tenderloin. My wife had the BUDDY Burger Special that was GREAT. One of the BEST waitress we have ever had. Just an all round FABULOUS time.
So I am back to give a second chance and from start to finish you have over exceeded my expectations.  From our waiter Victor giving us great advice on our meal choices, to all the staff keeping our coffee full and warm, and the food being flavorful and exceptionally good. I am impressed!  My first experience here was just ok. Today was awesome. The chicken was so flavorful and moist and my bacon waffles were incredible. The sage chicken benedict was just as good. The Chipotle sauce with the benedict was a great touch.  I have no complaints other than my pants feel tight.
This review is for the location at Harrah's / The Quad and not the western or Plaza Hotel locations.. . First things first, this place is EPIC!  It was crazy before when it wasn't inside a casino, but now it is even more over the top.  If you are in town on a busy weekend, it can take quite a while to get in and seated.. . Once you are inside, the decor is awesome.  This location is all glass and steel mixed with warm inviting colors.  Order one of their signature drinks or a mimosa...  a bit pricey but hey, go for it..  This is Vegas, baby!  Staff is friendly and very attentive.... . On my most recent visit, my friend and I ordered the fried chicken Benedict and when they brought it out, we were in complete amazement.  I thought it must be a joke and we were on TV.  This thing is so big and so much food it should be on Epic Meal Time!  We were barely able to finish it with two people and didn't need any lunch that day either.. . The size of the dish didn't in any way take away from the quality and flavor or the food.  The sauce they use is so good I can't even describe it.  All the rumors you have heard about this place are true.  Come here and experience the crazy good, epically gigantic food!
Delicious food and huge portions.  Fun atmosphere.  I couldn't get my 4G to work in the restaurant to read the reviews darn it.  I would have tried the sage chicken everyone raves about.  I had the sweet potato fries and fried salmon sandwich.  My only complaint was the corn meal coating was a bit crunchy like I had rocks in my mouth.  Still tasty though.  My husband got a bacon cheeseburger.  It was wild.  It was two patties with mashed potatoes in the middle, smothered in bacon and cheese.  He said it was wonderful.  We will be back.
Hands down, it's a 5 star.  Didn't need to think about it.  It's always packed and there is a reason for that.  My husband and I go here for Breakfast only...never been for lunch or dinner so can't speak to anything but the breakfast...which is the BOMB! . Portions are enormous.   I usually get the same thing every time 'cuz it's so darn good.  I get the omelet or I think they refer to it as a "scramble"  but it has eggs, feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes.  Never had a breakfast that was better than this place.   I am always surprised when I am looking around and I see people ordering cocktails at 10 am but it definitely is happening at the Hash House.   One weird thing is I don't think they bring butter with those huge fluffy biscuits.   No big deal for me as I usually save the biscuit for last and then am too full to eat it.  It's kinda on the pricey side but it is so good that it's worth it.   If you get a chance to order the au-gratin potatoes instead of fries, DO IT.  Those creamy, rich au-gratin potatoes are out of this world delicious!
Hubby and I stopped here for brunch during our yearly (3rd) anniversary trip to Las Vegas. I had the 'infamous' Sage Chicken. It was OK. Portions are large. Full of flavor, almost overwhelming with flavor. Mimosas were good. Service was decent, upon arriving the wait was short but for some reason they seemed to have forgotten to seat us. Overall the experience was nice. Not certain we'll be back since we both agreed that the food was just OK.
Great Bloody Mary! The food was good...and oversized as usual. . . The service was good, but a little slow at times...
Amazing.......one of the best in Las Vegas.  Every time a friend or relative comes into town we go! (They have to see and taste the food for themselves.)
ABSURD portions! I've never seen so much food! (That's not a complaint, by the way; just an observation.) I liked the casual atmosphere and my BLT was delicious. Would return.
Loved this place! Fast & welcoming service from the host & our server Victor. I ordered the Cinnamon Roll Soy Latte & the BBQ Chicken Sandwich w/ fries. I would rate the sandwich 4 out of 5. Everything else about this place was great. Will definitely come back. They have the famous fried chicken & waffles here (New York Times Bestseller). Came to West Sahara location. They have an awesome menu! Great breakfast/lunch/dinner options.
I don't want to tell you how good this place is for breakfast, or I will have to wait even longer next time I go! But I will..... . First brought here by my partner who loved the one in San Diego. It is one of our favorites breakfast places. Huge portions, really strong coffee, and always awesome service! I have heard the lunch is great too, but I have not tried it YET!. . There are several around the city. See if there is one near you. . You won't be sorry! YUM!!
Love this place! The portions are huge so be sure to arrive with an appetite!!  The Snicker pancakes are my fav!!  The wait for a table during breakfast on the weekends is real long, bring a newspaper.
This place was the bomb, cane in about 2pm thinking i was going to see long lines and there was no wait. Got a pancake and a eggbacon scramble which was amazing, all around the food was amazing. A little pricey at 8 bucks for one pancake but still it was pretty big and the taste was really awesome. my wife had a ginormous chicken pot pie which we too home , see the pictures i took...everything came out to about 50 bucks for two people but again we took some home and it was really tasty.
I've been to two of the locations in Vegas and the location in Orlando near the outlet mall.  OUTSTANDING food; EXCELLENT service.
Great food and even better service. One drawback is the size of the portion. I haven't seen anyone consuming that much food. Even half of that is two hours on treadmill.. Otherwise is great place for lunch and dinner
Solid for drunk munchies or really anytime.  Friendly staff in our two visits, drinks were average.  Chicken and waffles are highly recommended.  Benedict was forgettable.
The one we visited was inside the Plaze hotel and casino downtown... needed something we could both agree on that wasn't a buffet for a change.   . . I wasn't expecting to like it, but I really enjoyed it. The server was friendly and knowledgeable, helping my indecisive a** choose something I would like.  We got a few different things and shared - all were excellent. Massive portions yes, but we took to-go boxes and had food for the next couple of days! Not a downside in my opinion but I do live here - not practical to cart it around if you are vacationing, I'm sure. You could order one appetizer and one entree between two people and it would easily be enough.. . Got one of the signature drinks as I have an obsession with collecting souvenir glasses, and this one was awesome - cool, twisted design and good quality REAL glass. . . Husband LOVED the place... we will be going back soon.
I had read the great reviews on this breakfast place, so perhaps I had overly high expectations for this establishment before I stepped into it.. . The only thing I can say positively is that the descriptions of the large portions are accurate - they are generous. Everything else was mediocre. The coffee was so-so, not bad, just so-so. . . I tried the vaunted sage fried chicken with maple syrup reduction. I asked the waiter to serve the syrup separately and am I glad I did. The chicken itself was too crusted and greasy. Juicy enough, but otherwise flavorless. I tried a forkful of meat dipped into the syrup and it turned out cloyingly sweet. So I ate the rest of the meat with a little pepper and ketchup. . . I did have some leftovers for a small, late lunch while I traipsed around the rest of Vegas, so I guess that is a positive as well. . . So head there if you simply want to fill up your gut, but otherwise it's not really up to the hype.
Not worth the hype. The decor is my favorite part of the restaurant. Worth checking out if you're into trendy spots with okay food, I guess...
The chicken and waffles was everything I ever wanted, and more than I've ever deserved. Thank you Hash House.
I'd tell you how the food is but it's been hour and I still don't have a table. We were told 35 minutes. That don't happen. They don't seem to accommodate to the sizes of their the parties coming in.
Visited a while back to have the chicken and waffles Hash House is famous for with my friends and family. Service at table was fine, but service from kitchen slow for being lightly occupied that morning. It was edible, but most of the flavor came from the herb and syrup.    . Now, I have heard the argument about how people with severe allergies should 'just eat at home', but, when a guest of your restaurant asks that you please keep pork out of her dish and indicate it isn't a problem - why did my friend find a stray piece of bacon on her plate? We kindly addressed it with the server, but refused replacement entree as kitchen was slow. Not a total disappointment to my friend because she took leftovers to her hubby. With that said, the win at Hash House - the portions.
My boyfriend literally wanted us to come every morning of our Vegas trip! lol, thats how great the food is!!  Im happy they have built more since my first time.  I would try to the one off of the strip for a shorter wait (still 30 minutes minimum).. Food was fast and super yummy albeit quasi cold...that still did not affect my feelings for this place
Had breakfast here this morning  ... Food was really good we did light and healthy and my favorite the chicken Benedict. What I didn't like was that the fact that the  managers wife and children where in a booth next to our table. The toddler kept calling for his dad and dad would tell him to be quiet which he wasn't . Not appropriate even when you think it is !!!
Went there the other day was not real busy took me at least ten minutes to see a server then ten more to get my coffee maybe the server was having a bad day that does happen once in a while food was ok not great
I was fearful that this would be another overrated tourist trap, but I was blown away. Portions are huge- I'm a big guy and can only eat half of a plate when I visit.  I eyed the pancakes, chicken and waffles, and other dishes coming out... and there's no way I could finish any of them.. . Presentation of the food is what pushes it into the five star range. They do a great job.. . I've had two of the skillet plates and a pork tenderloin sandwich, and every time the food was delicious. The BLT Bloody Mary is a special treat.. . If you go at peak hours, you're probably going to have a long wait for a table. That's why I try to never go to any popular eatery during peak hours if I can help it.
After hearing so much about this place, we went to have breakfast there.It is way overrated!!! IHOP's pancakes are way better.
I really don't know what the fuss is all about this place?  Went for breakfast on 8-23-14 and their menu is a bit different.  Just some odd pairings.  Everything is pretty pricey.  I was looking all over for just your traditional bacon and eggs and hash browns and that was $13-14.  Finally found it and the hash browns are country potatoes that were hard and cold.  They make their own jam, sort of.  It was a gelled mess of a real strawberry.  I saw other people get waffles or pancakes that are huge but you only get one as a serving.  They get two stars instead of one because service was fairly good.  However, I would not return.  Too much money for nothing special.
