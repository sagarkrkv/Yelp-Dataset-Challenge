Went with friends for lunch. Authentic tacos, fast service and very reasonably priced. . Good selection, guacamole tasted great. All food is being made as you order it and it is going out the door pretty fast so very fresh. We ate outside under a covered area, however the air conditioner was not working so it was a little uncomfortable.
Everything here is really good! Spicy pork tacos are bomb! Must try if you haven't already! You can eat inside and outside too! :)
Wow!!! Absolutely LOVED this place!!! Out of all the restaurants we went to in Vegas this was our whole family's favorite. They had a separate line for specific foods, so make sure to pick the line for the food you want. The line for the Adobada tacos was a lot shorter than the line for the Cabeza tacos and moving a lot faster so we ordered Adobada tacos.  Mmmmm. Delicious! So glad we decided to try this little gem in Las Vegas NV! Will be back next time we're in Las Vegas.
This place lives up to its reputation.the taste is authentic Mexican food.i usually go to the place in tijuana and it tastes the same.If there are people putting negative reviews out means they aren't Mexican.definitely 5 stars
Pros:. -Lots of good food.. -The food is good.. -There is a lot of it.. -The food is cheap.. -You can get lots of good, cheap food all hours of the night.. . Con:. -Lines are long.. . Seems to me like the pros outweigh the con! This place is best approached with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Since there are different lines for different food items (one for asada, a different one for adobada, yet another for carne asada fries, etc.), you'll probably want to bring some friends, or stick to just one kind of food.. . Everything is delicious! And it's cheap, so you might as well just try one of everything. They have nopales (the quesadilla is my favorite), so there are options for vegetarians, too (although if you're very uptight about it, this is not the place for you...your nopales will probably touch a whole lot of meat before ending up on your plate).. . Ask for some grilled peppers and green onions to complete your meal, and stop by the condiment bar for extra hot sauce, radishes, and limes.. . Buen apetito!
Place is a madhouse. Crazy packed. Got some carne asada tacos and spicy pork tacos to go with carne asada fries. The fries were a pleasant surprise. Tacos are very good. The salsas need a little work. The meat in the tacos have a nice smokey flavor. Came here late at night to avoid crazy lines during the day.
The tacos are good.  Not great.  Definitely not worth waiting in an insane line for.  Luckily we went off peak hours.  But they were still so busy that my large order for the group couldn't be filled completely.  They were in such a rush that they handed me over to another cook and the order wasn't transferred fully.  . . The meat was tender but the tortilla was bland and didn't hold the tacos together at all.  The sauce wasn't special.  Really disappointed about that.  Have eaten at many great taco places in and around Los Angeles.  This place doesn't stand out.  Would eat it again if someone had brought take out but will not stand in line for it.
Is this the same taco joint as the beloved Tacos El Gordo in Chula Vista?  The taste and quality of the tacos today sure didn't taste like it!  . . What a complete disappointment!  I hyped this place up from Day 1 and we all braved the torrential downpour in Vegas and nasty morning hangover so that my friends could finally taste these infamous tacos.  Wow, I'm embarrassed now... They tasted like garbage.  The carne asada tacos were drenched in guacamole and the combination just tasted off.  Oh, and the spicy pork (adobada) tacos were just...different!  . . I gave the Tacos El Gordo in Chula Vista 5 stars, but this place deserves 1!  One star for the nice lady who handed us a roll of paper towels to dry ourselves because we looked like someone threw a bucket of water on us.
The tacos here are ok... not anything like the So-Cal Tacos El Gordo awesomeness. I love the ones in So-Cal, the flavor and taste is consistently bar none. But for some reason the Las Vegas location missed the mark. The flavor was off, meat had a lot of gristle, and some of the tortillas tasted a little stale. Don't get me wrong the tacos here are not terrible, just not anything close to what I've come to expect from Tacos El Gordo. Maybe it was an "off" day.
We went on Sept. 4 Thursday evening. It was our first time. . A bit confusing with different lines you have to stand in base on what you want. . We asked the cashier and she explained it well. . You can pay ahead of time or pay after you order and get your food. It's $2 a taco. . . We got the beef tacos (Carne Asada)- It was okay. Maybe overly cooked, kind of chewy.  Not memorable.  3/5 stars.. . We also tried the park tacos (Adobada)- mmm... taco heaven. Tender. They refer to it as spicy pork but it's not spicy. The taco tasted amazing. You can have pineapple on the side or on it. Same for the cilantro.  Throw some lime on it and boom ...5/5 stars! . . We didn't try the other items. . We highly recommend the pork tacos. Went back again just for them on Sunday sept7 evening.  The second time we went, they were cooking the pork at both stations and had to wait 10mins. This was around 6:30pm. Both evenings the line up wasn't too long. . . Negative- Most of the cooks were wearing hats. One was wearing a hair net.  It can get pretty hot and they were working hard. Lots of sweat. With the cook sweating that much on his face, it was not appealing to fear lots of the sweat dropping on to the meat as he was chopping it up.  Our cook wiped the sweat off his face twice when it looked like it was going to drip on to the food. Luckily none did. But a bit hunger killing seeing that. . . Definitely will be back.
Best tacos.  Hard to say anything that hasn't already been said.  I'm just here to backup all the other 5 star reviews and it's mainly for the pork tacos.
Overrated coming from someone who spent a lot of time in TJ and was almost born there. Lol. The best tacos were Carne Asada , adobada was close but not as good as tj. I asked for tripe and the tripe was close but not as good. The lengua I ordered I never got that's why I'm knocking down a star. I still recommend it compared to a lot of places in Cali, where I'm from. Solid 3.5 Starz
After a 5 hour drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas my boyfriend and I stopped at Tacos El Gordo for take out dinner back to our hotel. We ordered 14 ADOBADA tacos for both (we were really hungry). The tacos were great. We had them with the green sauce (guacamole?) and pineapple. Will definitely be back on my next trip to Las Vegas.
This place has some yummy tacos!! Lines can be long but well worth the wait! I had the al pastor and lengua tacos both were really good! The only bad thing is there isn't to much seating but people come and go quick so you won't be standing for long. If I came back to Vegas this will be my go to place! Beats the over priced and overrated restaurants off the strip any day!
The best street style tacos I have ever had. Holy crap was this delicious! Very very busy, be careful what line you get in as they sometimes only let you order what's onthe sign. . . We had taco de lengue and al pastor. (spit roasted on a rotisserie with whole pineapple in the center with the pork cuts cooking around it. . . Wanted to try more but it was late and they were crowded plus I was stuffed! Unless you are headed to Tijuana you won't get it this good or fresh anywhere. Don't miss this!
Fantastico!. If you are eating outside watch out for security. With I would have ordered more. Mexicano Mexicano :-)
Horrible Service and long lines for them to tell you that you're in the wrong line for the type of meat you want. They need to figure out a way to accommodate all type of meats in one line! The best meat they have is the Pork Adobada. Try to avoid during the day because it's just too hot and people tend to get rude in hot weather.
This place never disappoints. Ive had just about everything on the menu. But my favorite. Are the carne asada fries. Awesomeness in a box lol. The line is always a little long but hey when the food is that good. Thats expected. Order kick back and enjoy :)
It's a taco stand so don't freak about the. 3 stars. Have to hit it up when in Las Vegas I am sure it is safer than their Tijuana location... They have El Pastor and lengua as well  regular tacos and you can by beer at the liquor store next to the place.
Our first experience here was awful.  Did not even get to try their tacos.  The place was just too chaotic and disorganized.  The place was packed with wall to wall people.  There were lines everywhere.  We stood in one of the lines for about 10 minutes.  The lines were going nowhere.  In fact, some of the lines were getting backed up because folks were letting others cut in front of them.  Very uncool!!. . They should have a system in place to bring order to the madness whenever the place gets so freakin crowded!!  I enjoyed watching the disorganization for awhile, but after 10 minutes I had enough.  So we joined other people and simply left.. . Would return based on their impressive Yelp rating and number of reviews.. . I will just wait for a time when they are less chaotic.  Til then, just 1 star baby.
Definite must try! , so tasty, so fresh, so cheapppp!!. . Fast, made to order and just packed with authentic flavors! . . Try one of each honestly and the roasted peppers!. . The drinks are Delish!
This is only my 2nd review ever but I have to write about Taco's El Gordo. With the exception of going to TJ (I go to TJ at least 4 times a year) these are the best Taco's I have ever tasted and I go to a lot of Taco joints. Going to Vegas means going to Taco's El Gordo. What you need to get out of all the posts are that the Adobada sometimes also called Al Pastor (Pork - Not spicy at all even though they say it is) is perfection in a corn tortilla. Let me be clear I am not a fan of pork and I don't make a habit of eating it but the things this place does..... when it hits the lips. What makes this epic is the Guacamole Sauce that they put in it. Everyone I take has always loved it. For those daring enough to handle the wait you will always agree.... worth the wait. Oh and can't miss my shout out for the Asada Fries, think Nachos but with fries instead of tortilla chips.
We went on a Wednesday afternoon on Mexican Independence Day. It was not busy and the service seemed fast. You order and get your food before you pay. Seating inside is limited but people don't linger so it's easy to get a seat. The food was awesome. I tried four different tacos and all were very good. The best tacos I have had. I can't wait to eat here again.
All I can say is... we're in Mexico. Authentic cheap fresh street style tacos! Lengua all day! They even hand make their tortillas right then n there. Can't get any better than that my fellow yelpers!
Most amazing street tacos - adobado, get the peppers...make sure you get the roasted pineapple on top.
Casi una hora esperando en la linia los cosineros con su carota exepto 1 deveriande tener un manager de verdad no chafas  como los que estan ahi
Quite simply, the best authentic tacos in Vegas. Be sure to try them "with everything" - house made guac, cilantro, and grilled veggies. The flan they sell by the register isn't bad, either! This place is ideal for grab 'n' go; I'm a fan of ordering a dozen tacos and bringing them home to share with my roommates.
Bomb off the strip taco stand. This place is aleays crowded.
Best tacos in town! only problem are the long lines and that each line is only assigned to an specific meat, ex. If you want carne asada you have to stand in the carne asada line, you can't order any other meat than asada in that line.
I'm so surprised this place has 4.5 stars because these tacos are probably one of the worst tacos I've ever tasted. The wait was ridiculously long, the service was horrible (super rude waitresses), and the food was ridiculously salty. The quesadillas are double the price but they're really just tacos with a chip on the top. Do not recommend. Super disappointed :( . . . . . . But the lollipops were on point. One star.
After eating at this place, I can safely say I am lesser of a man than I was before and I will never be the man I was meant to be. The bad service made me question my value in life and for a brief moment I felt as if I was an utterly useless piece of shit. Tomorrow I will wake up to the sun and feel no warmth. . . P.s. don't order the quesadilla. Its a taco with a piece of chip on top. I can take a shit and put a chip on top and call it a burrito and it would be the top order on the menu
If you happen to be walking drunk (or sober) around the strip , you need to visit Tacos El Gordo.  I made my first trip over here when staying at The Encore a few years ago, and now make an effort to visit whenever I can.  These are legit street tacos, at a very affordable price (especially compared to the other crap you'll get on the Strip).  Make sure to try the different type of rotisserie style meats, and grab a good amount of salsa and limes.  You'll wanna pass out after this.. . Also, be prepared for the lines.  That's the only downfall.
I loved the atmosphere and the great customer service. We had tacos asada and whipped fruit drinks. . The tacos were delicious.  Fresh tomatoes,  onions, avocados,  salsa and meat seasoned to perfection. . We went in and had to ask for help placing an order.  Slightly confusing at first. There were 5 ordering stations. Each station had a cook preparing your food to order. The drinks are unlimited and tasty. The whipped drinks were tasty.. The seating is outside under a covered canopy. There were two attendants under the canopy.
Believe the hype!!!! Meat is so juicy the green sauce get EXTRA of that bomb!  the spicy pork is so good I've tried taco y taco & some were saying it's pretty much the same NO! It sure isn't el Gordo is thee best from taste, favor && hey it ain't open late for no reason. I live in Cali & the husband I go to gardena it's called the " taco truck" & we love that place we believe el Gordo tops that place. So try it real good !
Arguably our best meal in Vegas, certainly the most authentic. Value for food .. Tacos El Gordo takes it again. We ate some 5 star meals at some expensive casino restaurants. But all week my wife and I talked about how great their $2 tacos were. I goto Vegas fairly often, and this will now be a must visit for me each time.
Came here twice, BEST TACO EVER! Taco will never taste the same again....(lol, extreme but true, unless you have another locationyou can recommend in LA. I'm all ears) boyfriend and I are still seaeching for a replacement we can enjoy in LA.
Honestly, it was my first time coming to Tacos El Gordo and when I walked inside I got overwhelmed quick. The lines were so long until I realized that the way the ordering system was set up is brilliant. They separate the lines by the type of meat you want on your tacos. Perfect! I didn't want asada tacos which was the longest line. I wanted to have the lengua (cow tongue) tacos I just had to have them. I was saved from one of the employees who was super friendly to go to the other line were they also have lengua tacos. . . The wait was worth it! The meat was fresh and served when you order it just how you want it. It's a simple place that gets it and I like that. When you are done ordering you head over to the cashier and you pay there for your food and drink (if you get one). I loved that they had the lime and radish for you to get as much as you wanted. The tacos are priced at $2 a taco and I found it to be a good deal. . . Will I go back? Most definitely its a must!
