Wonderful selection, and tasty food! Traditional breakfast, itialian meats/cheeses, indian, Asian, seafood, salads, American and deserts. Not as many gourmet options like other places, but still really delicious and I loved the selection! plus, like no waits, and cheaper than some other buffets.
Ambiance: 4 - The place is very clean, nicely decorated. Very simple and modern. The tables are pretty evenly separated so that the people sitting next to you don't feel like they're having dinner with you! Honestly, it's a pretty nice space to have a buffet! . . Service: 3 - Service was just okay; our server wasn't super fast or even super friendly for that matter. You could definitely tell that she was tired and just wanted to get the job done. . . Food: 2 - While there was a nice variety of food, it wasn't cooked very well and didn't taste all that great. A lot of things were either dry or tasteless. Also, there was a lot of bread floating around, which I didn't like. I came here for food, not bread!! . . However, I did like the crab legs, one Mediterranean dip, one Chinese steamed dish, and the strawberry gelato (probably the best thing on the menu)!!! But, I didn't like enough of anything to come back. Though, if you are looking for a really expensivecup of strawberry gelato and nice ambiance, this would be the place for you!
This is no five star hotel buffet. Lacked variety. Seafood section just sucked ass. Only thing decent was the carving station and the gelato section. There were a few nice dishes here and there but definitely. not worth the 50 bucks a person. I also think vegas needs to rethink charging kids adult price. My friends kid hardly eats and she paid 50. It is ridiculous.
I just left the Buffet at Aria, and rather than playing poker or boozing it up, I am in my room sick. Not because I ate too much, because I honestly have never eaten so little at a buffet before. I am in my room because the food at the Buffet at Aria is so bad that it made me sick.. . For starters they sat me at a table under a light that kept going out so I had to change tables. I should have known right then that I was in trouble. . . I started out at the Asian section for some dim sum. The shrimp dumplings and chicken and pork shu-mai wasn't bad, but the bao was hard as a rock. For those of you who may not know what bao is, it's a steamed bun with chicken or pork instead. The steamed bun is supposed to be soft but these were so hard I didn't even attempt to eat it.. . Then it was on to the carving station for some ham. I loves me some ham, but this ham was drier than my napkin. Two bites and I was done with that. I did have some garlic mashed potatoes which were actually very good. Hands down the best thing on the entire buffet.. . Over to the Mediterranean  section where they were making fresh naan. Certainly they couldn't screw that up? Wrong. One bite and I was done. It was salty as hell and tasted like that made it with soy sauce, and a lot of it. The falafel was old, stale and tasteless.. . Over to the Italian station for some pasta that didn't suck. They also had some decent salami and meats in the antipasto section.. . Now time for the main course, CRAB LEGS!! Good size crab legs with decent amounts of meat, but they were old and the shells were impossible to navigate. Made it almost impossible to get to the meat. After a few minutes I stopped trying.. . Walked around and checked out some other stuff. The pizza looked decent, but I had pizza in Five50 the day before so I wasn't really into pizza again. There was a sushi section, but it didn't look fresh or appealing at all so I decided to pass.. . The one redeeming part was the dessert area. They had gelato which was actually quite good. The other desserts looked good as well, but my stomach was starting to not be happy because of how bad everything else was.. . The waitress asked me if everything was okay. I told her the food was not good, she said sorry and walked away. That's good for your tip. And speaking of tips, they had a sign at the front suggesting you tip18%. Seriously? 18% at a Buffet where they just bring you a drink and clear your plates? I usually tip 20% at restaurants, but buffets get 10% tops. Less if I tell you the food sucks and you just walk away.. . BTW, did I mention they charge $35 for this atrocity?!?! Wow. . . Quite possibly the worst meal I have ever had in Las Vegas...EVER! Avoid this place. There are too many good places to eat to even consider this place as an option.
We are currently staying at Aria and have had pleasant stay until we decided to give the buffet a try tonight. We felt like having a casual dinner at the hotel tonight and were very very disappointed. The food was unacceptable for this class of hotel. The shrimp lacked flavor, the pasta was dried out looking, the Mexican food wasn't even close to mexican, the baked potatos were hard and not all the way cooked. The only thing that was good were the mashed potatoes of the day. My husband got vanilla ice cream which tasted sour and the chocolate chip cookies were hard. Save your time and money and don't bother checking out this buffet. For the price head over to the wicked spoon buffet at the cosmopolitan, it blows Aria's buffet away. We will never eat this buffet again. Such a shame in this hotel.
It's a good buffet located at one of my favorite properties. It has a little bit of everything & I especially enjoyed the hot crab legs & cook your own steak stop! The quality of food is good. . It's a very modern setting & they also offer unlimited cocktails with your meals if you would like to pay extra. When my friends are in town it's a good option so everybody can get what they want.
So Torn about this one!. . This past weekend might not be the best indicator as I paid a $10 premium ($47.95) because it was Labor day weekend.  However, with the 37.95 price in mind, I'll do this review.. . This really has only one competitor, and that is the Wynn Buffet.  Let's do a head to head with that.  Definitely a notch below bacchanal and Wicked spoons like others have mentioned.. . Seafood - . . The Wynn was lacking in this department.  Please see my other review.  Basically, cold king crab legs, not-so-fresh oysters, so-so sushi.. TheAria did not do much better; however, they offered two types of crab legs including a cold and hot selection.  Match that with the cocktail shrimp and muscles... this round is by far in favor of the Aria.  There was a few other things but it escapes me right now.. winner - Aria. . Carvery -. . The Wynn wins hands down - but with a catch.  They were able to serve the best prime rib i've had on the strip.  Of course, it is a little hit or miss, but the piece I received was perfect.  . The Aria was terrible.  All the meats, sausages, chicken, "new york steak,"  and lamp were overcooked.  The cook, who i talked to, explained that the prime rib isn't cooked at the same kitchen and is kept warm under a heat lamp before being rolled out.  It explains the overcooked prime rib.  However, there was a surf and turf station so unique to the Vegas strip that it nearly pulls this one out of the gutter.  The sirloin steak is prepped separately and was THE BEST steak i've had on the strip.  Easily comparable to restaurant steak I've eaten in SF or downtown LA.   The dish alone, with the lobster topping is probably worth $15 alone.  If the prime rib was half as good as this, I'd be telling you to go to the Aria right now.  WIth that said, I don't think it was enough to pull a win over the wynn.. Winner - Wynn. . Variety -. . Wynn had a decent variety.  I liked its unique salad creations, its variety of meats and of course its desserts.  However, it was still limited in uniqueness.. . The aria had variety indeed.  It showcases indian cuisines which is pretty unique.  Their Nan bread is good and so is the humus.  There wasn't an abundance of things for indian food though.  The aria also displayed lobster bisque, tomato basil, and new england clam chowder.  I've had better clam chowder, but that's a different topic.  I would say it was on par with the wynn.  As mentioned in the carvery, the surf and turf station stands out prominently.  So for that reason, i'll give this round to the Aria.. winner - aria. . dessert -. . Just go to the wynn.  Nothing really special at the Aria.  . winner - dessert. . VALUE-. . Ok, so if I had 37.95 to spend... this is tough.  I would say the aria because I just expect so much more when I go to the wynn.  The service and decor is better at the Aria.  Everytime I left the table, my seat was cleared of all my previous plates.  That's impressive.  I'm also asked if I would like another "drink" every so often, at which point I am able to change my orange juice to a soda.  I don't often really like to keep drinking orange juice throughout the meal.. . Is this really a 4 star place?  Not really, but there's enough people leaving 1 star on here that if I gave it a 4 it wouldn't hurt.  They're definitely not an AVERAGE (3 star) buffet.  . . Spend the extra $10 and go to wicked spoon :)
For a buffet, this recently renovated spot is very good. We liked the wide variety of foods (dim sum, sushi, Indian, gelato, fresh seafood, soups, Chinese, meats, and more). Some of the food wasn't stellar, but some really was outstanding. I found the best tandoori chicken ever, fresh from the oven, moist and flavorful. Fresh, chewy naan was an unusual thing to see on a buffet and very welcome. Great prime rib and au jus. Great seafood. Soooo many choices! . . Lovely desserts; we found the less spectacular-looking things tasted better than many of the beautifully composed desserts. I loved the gelato.. . This was a good step or two above the Bellagio buffet, which surprised us.
On a whirlwind tour of buffets in Las Vegas, I came here this past weekend to try the brunch buffet on Saturday.  There was about a fifteen minute wait at about 11 a.m., which I thought was a little surprising.  . . After having gone to Bachannal for dinner the night before, I wasn't sure my stomach would be able to handle another buffet, but I often think of brunch the way some people think about desserts - it deserves its own stomach!. . There's a lot of selection here.  For $30 per person (and an additional $12 for bottomless drinks), I'd say it's a decent deal for a Vegas buffet.  I skipped over most of the Asian food since it looked mostly like reheated frozen stuff and helped myself a lot of the other things.  There's too much to name, but let me hit some of the highlights:  amazing breakfast pizza, yummy pre-made waffles (with different fillings - try the banana), decent corned beef hash, your own made-to-order eggs benedict bar,  a variety of refreshing pre-made salads, an interesting assortment of Indian foods (including naan and curried veggies and meats), etc.  They also have a made-to-order eggs and omelette station.  The ham at the carving station was delicious - lean but tender and flavorful - they have prime rib too if that's your fancy.  In other words, there's something for everyone here!. . There were some foods that weren't so great.  I felt like this was much more common in the dessert department.  For example, the donut that I had tasted crusty and dry, and a lot of their cakes tasted like they'd been sitting out for a while.  I probably wouldn't get an omelette again either - they're far too big and I don't like how they don't wrap the ingredients inside but instead intersperse them throughout the egg batter.. . Service:  Can't compare to the service you get at Bachannal.  They seem understaffed here (even though the restaurant wasn't at full capacity), and you have to exert some energy to flag someone down.. . Bottom line:  A decent option for a brunch buffet in Vegas.  I am realizing I forgot to try the gelato so next time...
It's not bad per se but this place doesn't even bother to try to keep up with the competition. You would think a nice hotel like Aria would try to up their game for buffets to compete with every other hotel but no, they just bank on people coming here because it's convenient. While the food wasn't bad---it just wasn't anything special. Nor was it very good. The buffet selection is just okay--but most things that they made were either over/under seasoned, over cooked, sitting out for too long, etc. LOL. . That being said though, our waitress was extremely friendly and nice and accommodated our dozens of drink orders and consistently always cleaned up our table. She was a big win for me.
The amount of options here is truly diverse. . Some of the featured items are;. . Fish Market - LOVED the unlimited crab. Certainly a favorite with my fam.. Asian - They had a really tasty chicken and broccoli dish I tried.. Italian -didn't try their Made-to-Order Pasta section but glad they had the option.. Pizza - Gluten free pizza dough available!. Mediterranean - The hummus in this section was basic  nothing really fancy. . Tandoori -Naan was decent. and a host of other stations I didn't try like Latin ,Carvery,and a Diner section with burgers. . . I did like the breakfast items such as the hash browns. I did find a hair in my food so that wasn't appealing. . . They are sort of expensive especially during the holidays. Regularly brunch is $29.99 but during the holidays its $34.99 and they don't even offer any holiday-ish items..... The Aria is a nice hotel and the buffet was clean and loads of options. If it wasn't for the hair in the food then it would be 4 stars. ..
Wish I would have checked Yelp before coming here. I can't believe I paid $45 for a dinner that would have cost under $20 at a non-buffet restaurant. For what it's worth, the food did taste REALLY good (get the turkey breast!!) but for the price, I don't think the options were worth it. There was a variety, sure, but in each section it was only a small amount of foods. . The service was pretty poor and they hardly came around to check on us even though the place was nearly empty.
I was in Vegas the past few days, and had the choice for a comped dinner buffet at Aria, or a lunch buffet at Bellagio. After reading reviews for both, I chose the dinner buffet at Aria, and I was not disappointed.. . First, let me say this: I did not go to this buffet to eat gluttonously. Instead, I took small portions of several items (6 trips, which I will explain in a bit) so I could sample more items.. . I added on the bottomless alcohol package for $12.99 and paired different drinks with different "rounds" of food. I will notate which drink I had. I had one beer, one Pinot Noir, and one Champagne. I also had a glass of club soda, which I used to cleanse my palate between items.. . And yes, I took notes while eating dinner!. . Round 1 - Stella Artois Beer. -----------. * Truffle Mac & Cheese - I'd never had truffles before and I love mac & cheese. This was delicious. The sauce was light, and not overpowering, and the truffles were tasty!. * Jasmine rice - This was from the Asian section. It was good - not dry at all.. * Prime Rib w/ Creamy Horseradish - a bit dryfor my liking.. * Meatball w/ Marinara and Parmesean - I had two of these - and they were so good. The marinara sauce was a bit spicy, which was a nice and welcomed surprise.. * Multigrain roll with cranberries - I thought this was a standard multigrain roll. When I bit into it, I saw there were cranberries. Bonus! . . Round 2 - Stella Artois Beer . -----------. * Carnivore Pizza slice (pepperoni, sausage, bacon) - It had been sitting out for a bit, and was a bit cold.. * Pineapple Sausage - This was from the Asian section - quite tasty, I liked the fact the pineapple was mixed in with the sausage. I'd never tried anything like it before.. * Chicken Pot Stickers - Cold, hard, and stuck together. Very disappointed.. * Vegetable Pad Thai - Good, but not a lot of spice/flavor. But good.. * Beef w/ Veggies - Similar to a Mongolian beef, w/o peppers. Was a bit cold.. * Provolone Cheese - Wow, these were pungent!. . Round 3 - Stella Artois Beer. -----------. * Beef Steamship - Like the Prime Rib, this was a bit dry. Perhaps I should have tried the au jus (in retrospect).. * Lentil Orzo - Cold pasta salad - orzo, lentil, and tomatoes. Freaking delicious!. * Portugese Sausage - One of my most favorite items all night - spicy, tender, and delicious.. . Round 4 - Pinot Noir - Parducci, Mendocino City. -----------. * Clams - I tried clams for the first time....and I liked them!!. * Sirloin Oscar - Served with crab meat, bernaise sauce, and asparagus. This was grilled to order and was the highlight of my meal. Great char and flavor on the steak. I got mine Mid Rare+ (between MR and M). The Bernaise sauce was phenomenal. The crab was delicious as well!. . Round 5 - Pinot Noir - Parducci, Mendocino City. -----------. * Pork Belly - Nice crispy skin, very tender meat.. * Chorizo Rope Sausage - Hello flavor explosion! Spicy and tasty!. * Au Gratin Potatoes - Very good - mild flavor, not overly cheesy.. . Round 6 - Prosecco Champagne - La Marca, Veneto, Italy. -----------. * Red Velvet Whoopie Pie - Nice tender cake, great cream filling. Nuts on top.. * Creme Brule - nice glaze, but too creamy inside for my liking.. * Coconut Macaroon - Nice toasted outside. I could've eaten so many of these!. * Brownie - Rich, chocolatey - it's a brownie! But seriously, this was wonderful.. * Oreo Gelato - One word: divine.. * Cinnamon Crunch Gelato - The show stealer of the desserts. Oh. My. Gosh.. . Regarding drinks, the Pinot Noir was really good for being, what I assume, to be their house Pinot. The champagne was delicious as well. In fact, I will be looking to purchase a bottle of both the Pinot Noir, and the Champagne later this week if I can find them.. . While some of the carved items were dry, I will admit I did not use Au Jus, and I can only imagine the difference that would have made. There are so many choices here: Italian, Latin, Indian, Asian, Deli, Seafood, Carvery, Desserts, and much more. I did not even remotely try everything on the buffet, nor could I, as I would not have been able to eat it all. But I will try more items the next time I go back.. . Do yourself a favor, and have dinner at the Aria buffet the next time you are in Vegas. Despite some of the items being cold, the service was outstanding. This place gets a solid 4.5 stars from me.
I was not impressed. Flat out. I really don't have a lot to elaborate on this place... they've really got to step up their food selection! Had I known that the flavor would be bland across the board I wouldve just stuck with crab legs and dessert... those were the only things that I was actually excited about. Everything else could have been served at a Golden Corral and I wouldn't have known the difference. Bland...and/or dry... and/or folks trying to be clever with cooking foods that are better left keeping it simple. . The turkey wasn't too horrible... but it wasn't good enough that I felt the need to try the other meats they had to offer..which wasn't much if I recall correctly. The mashed potatoes were bland. I had been craving pots mashed, too... so that really got me down. They had some fancy macaroni that just didn't do it for me. Perhaps I'm too country for Aria's buffet... but come on... what's a buffet without good ol' macaroni and cheese?!. If you want crab legs mid week...swing through here.. if you don't mind dropping about $40. We had a comp for a BOGO free dinner buffet (MyVegas game on Facebook) so that's what got us in...but I think that after leaving there...we will not be returning.
Went here for did-din with girls. The food was decent. Skirt steak was slightly chewy, but shrimp and salads were good. Definitely bang for your buck.  I would come back just for deserts:)
Great food but the bottomless cocktails, even better
