Don't get me wrong, the food is great..... But not worth $50 a person. . . Since we're staying at the Bellagio, we hit the buffet more than once, simply due to convenience.  Breakfast is by far the best. Their biscuits and gravy is to die for! . . The only reason we're giving them 3 of 5 stars is service. The cashiers are not friendly at All and act as if they can't understand or hear your half of the time. We were almost overcharged more than once, which was simply annoying. The wait staff is unattentative, unless you look like you have tons of money.. . Regardless, we all paid the same price and should receive the same experience.
Really expected more from the bellagio! There was nothing special about this buffet. It felt smaller than the other buffets I have been to in vegas. My first plate I got mostly breakfast things and didn't eat any of it, just dry and bland. Ribs and prime rib were the only thing that stood out as memorable. But I went back for more and they were gone. Desert was not great. We opted for the $12 extra unlimited drinks and that was a great value for me since I was getting mimosas but the margaritas they were serving didn't taste like they had any tequila in them at all. I would recommend spending the extra $20 or so and go to wicked spoon.
Arrived around 12 pm? For lunch with my boyfriend it wasn't too packed on a Friday surprisingly. I'm always disappointed at buffets cause everything just tasted mediocre.  But this buffet has to be my favorite of all time! Their steak is so good and the quality is up there. Everything else was good as well too. Very good selection of food.
Food is ok, lots of selection. Just a way pricey for its quality on a Labor Day. Should have been more special. Dessert bar isn't what i expected.. Crab legs was wayyy frozen and salty.
I usually come to this buffet when I'm in Vegas because it is the best one on the strip from my past experiences. There was a good selection, just not too many things that I cared for this time I went.  Very pricey considering what I ate. I ate the usual suspects-crab legs and cocktail shrimp. The crab legs were very small and thin, maybe I got the bottom of the batch. The miso sea bass was good.  I filled mostly on creamed spinach and mushrooms. Big selection of desert, I tried most of them. The only ones that I liked were the creme brulee and vanilla ice cream, and better when I ate them together.  Food wasn't anything great,  but then again it is a buffet and got the job done.  Service was great-they took the plates away quickly everyone I got up and I had a new cup of seltzer before I finished the first without having to ask.
Hands down one of the best on the strip. We tried aria and we're not impressed expect the meats were delicious ......But the bellagio has soooo many choices the dessert and sushi were awesome.
Nothing bad to say about this buffet. Prices are very good I thought, seeing as its the Bellagio and Vegas. Thought everything I got was great! Great french onion soup, salad bar, and of course, the dessert section was amazing!  Loved that they had sugar free and gluten free options for folks with diet restrictions.  My husband said the omelette bar was great too!  I also highly recommend getting the fresh squeezed orange juice.
Mediocre at best, the prime rib was tasteless and chewy. The fish was dry, the sourdough rolls were so hard that I one could be used as a weapon. The salad was the best part because I made it on my own.
Food was good and our server was great. The management is very rude to their employees, especially those that are latino. I didn't like to see that and this is why I'm eating a 1. There is no need to make someone feel like they are less than you
Lemonade tastes bad...food is ok, nothing exceeds my expectation. Went to see O Show n thought would give ita try...wouldn't go again.
We tried this a couple of days after going to the Aria buffet and were really surprised it didn't give Aria more competition. Soft serve ice cream instead of gelato, Bellagio? Seriously, soft serve? . . There were bananas Foster (not superlative) and very nice creme brulee, one of our favorites.. . The prime rib was very good, as was the au jus. The crab legs and shrimp were good but standard fare. The sushi selection was rather disappointing, especially compared to Aria. . . The plusses were few and far between. There was an excellent selection of picture-perfect fresh fruit and a nice garnish bar with olives and nuts included. In contrast, the bread was below lackluster. At Aria I actually was tempted into two selections; at Bellagio it was easy to skip breads completely. The soups were boring and not at all tempting even though there were several selections available. I kept wandering around thinking I might have missed something, but no, I had not. . . My first glass of lemonade was fine. The next one was watery; the replacement wasn't very good either. Oh well. . . Go to Aria instead.
As a Las Vegas local and big fan of the buffet, I say this is easily the best buffet in town.  Have eaten here about a dozen times and will say it's consistently fantastic.   . . So much variety cooked to perfection and the taste is amazing across the board.  The service staff must be well taken care of because they are always attentive, polite, and efficient.. . I seriously question the objectivity of anyone who offers up less than 4 stars for this magnificent wonderland of gluttony.
re:  BreakFast buffet. . My wife and I have made it a tradition over the past 7 years to eat at this Buffet each time we go to Vegas.  The name and decor is timeless in my opinion.  Even as old as the Bellagio is, this place is classic and has maintained an unbelievable level of upkeep.  We enjoy the robust selection of items available each time we go to this Buffet.  They really do a great job and we've NEVER EVER had problems.  This buffet is definitely one of the more expensive buffets on the strip and I believe it's still great value for what they provide.  . . Usually, we do not eat Breakfast Buffets as we are always sleeping in.  However, this time, we ate the Breakfast Buffet due to a long drive back home.  I can honestly say, this breakfast buffet truly exonerated what it means that Breakfast is the best meal of the day.  If you're up early enough for breakfast and want a buffet, the Bellagio is a must.. . My one negative is that they only have one bathroom stall.  I had to wait over 10 minutes, because some jackazz was smoking in there.  I did not realize that until I went to use the bathroom, because otherwise I would have told someone.  They really only have the bathrooms there for convenience, because they want to control who leaves and exits the dining area.  They really need to install another stall or maybe a separate restroom.
Where do I start? My first time staying in Vegas and experiencing a buffet that I was really looking forward to trying. Disappointed is an under statement. The price my wife and I paid was ridiculous for the quality of food we had. There were some items that I never tried that were actually pretty yummy but other things were not that great. Like the crab legs I was soooo looking forward to trying were COLD. So were the shrimp and the cod and salmon were flavorless. . . What was good though was the crawfish, tiramisu, and this smoked salmon tart looking thing with a fish egg to top. Everything else was just substandard. . . I do not recommend this place nor will I be returning.
Why 3 stars?. Its because ive been to bacchanal at ceasar palace and if to compare the two. bacchanal is far greater than bellagio. . . Price check. . Bellagio = $30+. Bacchanal = $59$. . Just add 20 more and you will not regret it! =) . . Goodluck to buffet hunters! . . Happy feasting!
Most of the reviews are pretty accurate.  Food is ok.  Definitely not what I was expecting from the famous Bellagio, and especially not for $50 per person.  This was our first trip to Vegas and after looking at their site I had been craving this buffet for a week.  When we finally got inside everything was very underwhelming.  Staff was ok but not very outgoing kind of just going through the motions.  We had the lamb chop, kobe style beef, crab legs, prime rib and sushi.  Sure it was a great variety but flavor was lackluster.  Nothing else looked enticing and I tried a fruit tart just for the heck of it but could have done without.  I would look elsewhere for a better buffet.
Food was food nothing special. .. deffintly would not eat again.. not worth the money.. many more places to eat in Vegas if u wanna spend $50
if you truly care about the quality of the food you eat, then do not come to this buffet. almost everything tasted like basic diner food (denny's and ihop anyone?). It was super disappointing since we paid $50 per person. i don't recommend this place nor will i be coming back.
One of my favorite buffets in Vegas. My family and I come about once every two years and Bellagio never disappoints. The hotel had a reputation of being Vegas's classic hotels and the buffet doesn't stray far from that image as well. . . The staff is kind and the food is delicious. There's something for everyone. From salads to sushi, there's bound to be dozens of options that you'll crave again and again. . . The price isn't too high either compared to other buffets in town. The quality of service and food is excellent and a must go if you're in Las Vegas!
The Buffet at Bellagio never disappoints and we always eat here at least once during our annual visit to Las Vegas. We have tried others in Vegas (The Wynn Buffet, etc.) and they cannot light a candle to the Buffet at Bellagio. The Bellagio Buffet features peel & eat shrimp, snow & king crab legs, sushi, salads, prime rib and many, many more delicious options. The dessert choices are also very delicious. The staff is friendly and the decor very pleasant. The $32.42 per person (includes tax) lunch is well worth the price. Also, if you arrive at the tail end of lunch, you can stay for the dinner at the lunch price and enjoy many additional options!
Cheaper and not as good as it used to be. Not bad but not the 5* it used to be. I could say it was the best buffet I'd been to ever before (I'm a foodie and usually don't do them but if I hear of a great one). but this last trip, the $ went down and so did the quality.
This is one of the better buffets I've been to in Vegas.  A very wide selection of food and all of it was pretty good!  A lot of seafood too, which is a plus for me!  Lots of dessert options.  We went on a Saturday night so there was caviar, sushi, crab legs, etc. . . Not sure those are there on other day.  I was SOO stuffed afterwards!  Great buffet!
Went for Sunday brunch this last week. For two people it was about $64 with tax. I think normally lunch is around $23. Opted for the all you can drink option with sangria, mimosas, champagne and bloody Mary's among others for $13.  The buffet is way better than the Wynn buffet for lunch. Wynn cuts out waaayyy too many premium items for lunch at the price they charge.  Bellagio has great breakfast staples like made to order omelets, incredible eggs Benedict, French toast, pancakes and not paper thin bacon. Furthermore if you come around 11 they will set out the spicy tuna hand rolls. Yes I said hand rolls and also California rolls. and spring rolls.  Prime rib and turkey were also available along with an ample amount of vegetarian, Asian and dessert options. My standout was the vanilla eclair.  Highly recommend the bellagio for any lunch meal.
This place seems to get forgotten amongst the newer fancier buffets around town, but this place still holds it's own. Yes it still is quite expensive, $43 for "Holiday Buffet." ( The holiday, btw, was Mexican Independance Day. Really Bellagio?) .      Wasn't crowded at all on a monday night so was seated right away. Service was good, no complaints there. I come to Vegas to eat seafood and meat. The selection was really good especially the carving stations with ribs, lamb chops, and prime rib. The quail and the sea bass were exceptional. Most everything tasted really good so i was very satisfied overall. I would say Ceasars may be a little better but not by that much. .      Seems like the guys at the carving station are kinda ticked off and mad about something, but then again if i had hundreds of rude tourists barking at me i would be a little ticked off too.
The Bellagio Buffet isn't bad, but it isn't spectacular either. If you are in Vegas and have time for one buffet, go to Bacchanal. I expected more from a Las Vegas buffet in the Bellagio, but it could also be that I ate Bacchanal yesterday and became somewhat jaded to Vegas buffets.  We ate Sunday brunch which was priced at a reasonable $30 per person, it would be an extra . We arrived about 1pm and the wait time was about 20-25mins from the beginning of line to being sat at our table.  Our waitress came over and served us coffee, orange juice and water.  The selection was probably about a third of what is available at bacchanal, about 15 breakfast items like eggs, omelet station, bacon, turkey sausage.  The food was of good quality but it seemed that the taste and flavor was lacking. Their lunch/dinner selection consisted of prime rib, pizza bland pasta marinara among other things.  They also had a salad station, sushi station, table full of shrimp packed in ice.  Their desert spread was average, some soft serve ice cream and sorbet, cookies, some ecclairs and bread pudding.  Overall, I would recommend the Bellagio Buffet, but second to Bacchanal.
Good food selection but don't go after 9:30pm. The food is picked up at 10:15 so you have to eat very fast. It was not the best buffet I have been to but I was surprised with some if the selections e.g Kobe beef steak, lamb chops.  The chicken tikka masala dish had good flavor but not authentic, was obviously made with a pre made masala mix. Desserts were just ok. Large selection but not great.
