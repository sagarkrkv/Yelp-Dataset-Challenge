Returned after a long time to find that the few things that I thought were less than perfect had improved beyond my wildest dreams -- JACKPOT!  Spectacular food, and a great, truly stylish and adult environment now.  Awesome improvements, I will return again soon!
I called to find out how much their happy hour price for beer was.  She didn't know.  (She only works there)  She then said their half off.  Another person comes by who she asks and they didn't know either.  At this point I'm thinking....seriously, is the younger generation these days this clueless?  After being put on hold, she says 4.00.  So, normally the beers are 8.00?   I don't know, but there's too much confusion for me to give this place a try.  Good luck.
A friend and I went here late on friday... Loved the ambience!!  The staff was very friendly and the service prompt! Would definitely recommend...
I love Fez! Everytime I go I know I'll have amazing food and a great atmosphere!
I have gone here twice in the last year. Once for my brothers high school graduation lunch and a second time for a meeting. The food is great along with the location. The restaurant is clean and organized. I don't have much to comment about the service because I didn't pay much attention to it.
I used to come here all the time because I worked in an office right down the road. I loved the Rosemary Chicken Sandwich and comes with a simple but delicious side salad. I've tried the Kisra and Spicy Harissa Hummus and would recommend that as well - but as the name implies, you have to like hummus and you have to like spicy. I got the salmon once and was super annoyed I ventured to try something different because it was dry, tasteless, and close to $20. Don't get that!. Overall, it's a quick and easy place for lunch and the staff is very friendly and eclectic.
I've always enjoyed Fez, though it's never been my first choice for dinner or drinks. The staff is friendly and the food is decent, but the menu has never grabbed my attention. Drinks could be better priced, but they're at least well made.
I came here after seeing all the reviews on yelp.  This place is great for drinks or a date night.  We had the lamb sliders and arroz con pollo.  I enjoyed the chicken dish a lot!
Yum-O! Some of my favorites are the gyro spinach salad, g-spot cocktail and the creme brulee
Always a great spot to chill. Fun drink menu, andthose Kisras...delicious!
FEZ is an absolute gem! Having been here multiple times I have had their Super Garlicky Hummus, Gyro Kisra, and a chicken sandwich with a side salad. Everything that I have tasted here has been prepared beautifully and seasoned to perfection! You can tell they use fresh ingredients in their dishes as they are all flavorful. Off the drinks menu I have had the Peach Bellini and the G-Spot, both were super yummy and they definitely did not skimp on the alcohol (plus!). The staff is always extremely friendly as are the guests that come. I will keep coming back to FEZ!
Don't think I'll come back. The food took a long time to come out, given that I went for lunch and there were only about 6 other people in the restaurant at the time. The service was not very attentive, water and refills went unnoticed. The food was also pretty spicy, which would mean you need water and refills more than normally.
This is one of my favorite restaurants. It has a fun, contemporary atmosphere. The menu is diverse and delicious. Highly recommend the Fez burger with a pomegranate martini. Yum!
Burger lovers take notice best burger ever! - a delicious juicy burger on a tasty ciabatta with a lovely garlic mayo cooked exactly the way I like it - medium rare.  Fries were excellent too.  The service is top notch and a nice atmosphere.   The menu looked interesting with lots of mediterranean fare.  Definitely worth a visit.
I've been here twice now and it's a great place for lunch. The Fez burger was delicious but nothing impressed me more than the sweet potato fries. They are topped with Cinnamon and served with a surprisingly refreshing apricot aoli. The pizza was mediocre. I'd go for a burger or sandwich!
Brunch was a-ok here.  Ordered the french toast with pears and bananas with bacon.  Everything's better with bacon.  Didn't wow me but I didn't hate it.  Very trendy, modern vibe.  Had the g-spot cocktail which was quite tasty.  I'd go again, but probably ordering something different.
Wow this place is Nuts. But still a crazy time.
