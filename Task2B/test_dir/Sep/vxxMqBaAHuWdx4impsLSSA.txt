This buffet has garnered a lot of attention as being one of the best buffets in Las Vegas which i really disagree with. . Located at the M, go during the lunch hours to avoid long lines during dinner.  Seafood buffet is offered all weekend for $39.99 offering shrimp, crabs and oysters.. . Now to go into why I don't think this buffet is all that great is that they really don't offer anything special in terms of food.  Oysters? Crabs? Shrimp? these are available in almost any las vegas buffet.  The other choices of food are pretty standard (salad bar, pizza, asian).  They offer "sushi' which is a paper thin slab of cheap fish they put on a big mound of rice.  The soup here is good in particular the miso soup but no one pays that much for miso soup.  My previous review of the bellagio buffet earns its high ratings because of king and snow crab options, steak tartar, pesto shrimp pizza, rack of lamb and real cuts of sushi.  . . Yes they do offer free alcohol (beer, wine and alcohol cider) but to me, its not a big wow factor. The cider they serve here is really good, I would recommend trying that than any other alcoholic options.. . Dessert area is okay but nothing spectacular. . Overall: Best buffet in Las Vegas? Not too sure about that since their options are pretty standard amongst other buffets, check out bellagio's buffet and you'll see what a quality buffet looks like
Friday lunch time was when we hit this buffet. I beat the weekend crowd and weekend price. Was happy with the bargain and wide variety of food selection at this buffet.. . Top three buffet in Vegas behind Bacchanal and Wynn.
To be fair, I'll separate this review into 2 parts: 1 about the food and 2 about the horrendous service.. . (((1))) FOOD: 3/5 stars. $24 per person for the weekday (no seafood) dinner buffet - certainly a better price than the buffets on the strip. The food here was average. I was only able to find a handful of solid items that I could enjoy. Would I come back? Slight chance, but ONLY for the the sashimi salad and the few items I have listed below:. . - Salmon sashimi salad - This was the star of the entire dinner. The salmon was extremely buttery, sweet, moist, and fresh. I could just eat this all night and be happy. . - American beef BBQ ribs - The ribs were meaty, not too dry, and the BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy. It satisfied my rib craving just fine.. - Chinese style BBQ pork ribs - The Chinese BBQ sauce was sweet and not too salty. The ribs were moist, meaty, and didn't have too much fat, which made it enjoyable. . - Kalbi (Korean BBQ beef ribs) - I enjoyed the flavorful and bold Korean sweet and salty marinade. Some of the meat was tender, but there were also many pieces that were charred to a crispy black.. - The creme brulee was perfectly custardy. . - The luscious flan had a beautiful smooth texture and not overly sweet.. - I also enjoyed being able to order Americano and expresso from the dessert bar. They were both light (watery) and not robust, but they were packed with enough caffeine to fight off the food coma.  . . The rest of the food and desserts offered at the buffet were either dried out, overcooked, bland, mushy, or tasted like dishwater.I was also really looking forward to the oysters and crab legs that I've seen in pictures, but alas I didn't see them being offered last night - Note: the seafood buffet is more expensive ($40) and it's only offered Fri-Sat-Sun. . . (((2))) SERVICE: 0/5 stars. The servers here are shockingly rude and ruined my experience at this buffet and my appetite. . . When we arrived, the ladies working the front registers advised us that their buffet line will be closing at 9 pm tonight and that's also when the food will stop being refreshed. It was about 7:50 pm, so that wasn't a problem to us - from our understanding, we wouldn't be able to grab anymore food after 9, but we would still be able to finish our meal even after the buffet line was closed. Well, that's typically the case at most buffets.... . Apparently that's not the case here. What ended up happening was, we grabbed our food, ate, and when 9 pm rolled up, our server abruptly came up to us and said, "you have to leave now, we're closed." Her tone of voice was extremely coarse and unprofessional. Mind you, we still had a plate full of food in front of us and we were in the middle of eating (chewing) when she rudely addressed us. I had an obvious look of confusion written all over my face and she then quickly said, "I'll give you up to 5 minutes, then you must leave" --- Wow, who talks like that? I was in utter shock that our server was so extremely abrasive. We were just trying to enjoy the rest of our dinner and didn't know that they wanted us out of the restaurant by 9 pm - no one told us that! How does "buffet line closes at 9" = "you must get out by 9"?!. . We quickly tried to finish chewing so we can get the heck out of there and then another gentleman rushed up to us and yelled at us, "just to let you know, you have less than 2 minutes to leave." ---seriously? You can't even approach us with kindness and professionalism? I was beyond infuriated at that point and also still so confused as to how the staff here carried themselves with such poor etiquette. . . With hindsight, I understand that it was major negligent miscommunication between the staff and my party, but even so, that's never an appropriate reason to mistreat your guests or speak to them like they are livestock. . . Also, to rub a pound of salt into our wounds - I didn't even know we could have unlimited beer/wine during our buffet - none of the servers or staff informed us. I just ordered a coke and our waitress never even came back to refill it! My glass was empty 15 minutes into eating there and I had to get up and go look for her and ask her if I may get a refill. Of course she forgot to refill it, so I had to get another server to refill it for me. Finally, my server waltzes up with my refilled coke. It was an extremely annoying dinner to say the least.
According to various reviews, this is the best buffet in Vegas.  For the seafood price of $39.99 I was hoping for lobster tail, but I had to settle for lobster macaroni and cheese and lobster bisque. Both were excellent. It helps that the crab legs are cut open now,but that was already the case at Valley View Casino in the San Diego area. The sushi selection was limited to cut rolls,which were all right.  Having the option of adding wine, gelato, and cappuccino probably sets this buffet apart from others, but I don't drink wine.
Hungry? Looking for a top tier Vegas buffet? Coming or leaving Vegas? Is it a Weekday? . . If you answer these questions "YES" then you need to read no further. Studio B is the best option for you. Put it into your phone GPS and start making your way over. . . Studio B started a trend that the Cosmopolitanism and Caesars have been following up on in recent years of revamping the quality of the Vegas buffet. It's lost its new charm and appeal, but is still a damn good option for a large meal in the city of sin. . . Studio B being off the strip is often less popular for the mass crowds. Its clientele is a little different, but that's okay. The food is well worth the drive. Weekday pricing of ~$25 is an unbelievable deal considering the quality that you are receiving. Almost everything here is good, even if you are not coming on seafood night. Meats, Asian, Italian, American, Mexican, the staples are all here. They even serve limitless draft beer, cider, root beer, and wines for your enjoyment. Something most other places will make you pay an extra premium for. The deserts are top tier also with a myriad of gelato and pastries. . . Seriously, Studio B is a great option if you're looking for a budgeted Vegas buffet experience. Make the drive.
This by far is my favorite buffet in Las Vegas.  There is a wide selection of food served in smaller size portions to insure fresher food. Buffet includes beer or wine should you desire.  The desserts are so worth it.  I always leave more than full.  The line fills up fast so get there with time to spare.  It's worth the wait.
I wouldn't come back. Pretty wide variety of food, but everything was meh in quality. Crab legs were not meaty and completely flavorless. Blehhh! . . Beer and wine are included in the price, but the selection is bad quality.
Great food. Everything was divine. Free drinks, great service.. The only thing would be to hire more cashiers. The line was to long.
You get a great variety at this buffet, but the food wasn't all that great. In all fairness, I like to get sushi at Vegas buffets. In this case, the variety was limited and the rice was hardened by the time I put it on my plate. The best part was the prime rib, and the beer/wine are free with admission too.
Outstanding! Highlights: crab legs (both steamed and cool), Mediterranean (baba ghanoush, dolmas, olives, cheeses, cold cuts), korean (kimchi, short ribs), japanese (sushi, sashimi salad, tempura veggies).. Extensive desserts, espresso bar, gelato!!!. Free alcohol, which attracted people that couldn't handle their drinks!!. CA residents get $5 off through the month of October!!. Would go back just for the fact that I can have a good short espresso after my meal!!
A little disappointed that the quality of some of the items I used to enjoy there has gone down a lot.  The sushi is now the same stuff you can get a gas station convenient store and the crab legs have very little meat on them and lack flavor. Otherwise the cooked foodselection has remained the same and they still offer beer and wine with the buffet.  So overall it was a let down to see this happen.
my fav buffet in vegas. however, sometimes the quality is not as great. The seafood section can be more fresh if possible. but overall, it's still a great deal compared to other buffets.
Don't go to the Sunday seafood buffet if you want fresh food. Not worthy of the $39.99. The crab was just OK. The cold shrimp were dreadful. They poured way too much ice on it so they became flavorless and soggy. The prime rib and dessert was pretty good though. But everything else was just not like it used to be. When they first opened they really payed attention to detail. Now it seems like management just don't give a crap cause it showed in the food.
Horrible horrible service. A line that does not look long will take an hour to get seated. You will see plenty of empty tables but they will refuse to seat people for some inexplicable reason. This is not how to treat customers. Avoid unless you enjoy waiting an hour in line and then looking around at at a half empty restaurant.
PROS:. - A lot of yummy cuisine options including Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Korean, Mexican, and Italian. - The chefs were on top of it, food was constantly being replenished. - Our waiter was a nice guy who's originally from New York.  We never had to ask for a refill of our drinks. . CONS:. - The orange chicken wasn't good. - The dessert is disappointing.  I tried 6 and liked zero, so don't make room for it
Pros: Good food, good selection, great deserts. Cons: Long waits to get a table and the weekend buffet will cost you some serious money.
Went there last year 2013.  It was one of the best deals around, and the food is excellent for it's price and location off strip.  Ox tail was my favorite.  The high point is the free alcohol.  But I think the point is that they want you drunk so you can't drive away and have to stay and gamble for a few hours.  That's exactly what I do every time I go there!  But if you gamble with enough points, you get the meal for free!  It's easy enough to get the points within about 2 hrs of heavy play.
Came here on a Sunday night for the Seafood Buffet ($39) and waited about 30 minutes. Visually I was very impressed with the open layout if the restaurant. The decor is consistent with the rest of the M resort and is clean, modern and appealing. . . The food selection was great- from fresh seafood (crab legs, shrimp cocktail, oysters, etc..) to sushi, to a meat station (prime rib, lamb, and turkey), to a great array of Chinese food (even oxtail!), Italian (pastas and pizzas), decent salad bar, large dessert bar and an actual open bar (stocked with unlimited beer and wine)... Yes, unlimited beer and wine!. . FYI- my review might be a little biased because I don't eat crab legs. The selections looked great but the taste didn't really measure up. Everything tasted fine but nothing really stood out. My favorite was the oxtail and I definitely recommend trying that.  Like some of the other reviews, the dessert bar looked awesome but there was only one thing that I liked- the coconut macaron. Everything else was too sweet and didn't have much specialness. Really disappointed in the gelato. We tried the Thai ice tea and coffee flavored ones and as odd as this sounds, it was too sweet and rich. It was difficult to eat more than a couple spoonfuls. They also serve coffee/cappuccinos near the dessert bar, which is a plus. . . Unfortunately, our server was not great- very slow and not attentive. . . Definitely not a bad deal if you are super hungry and are looking for quantity and decent food. For the Seafood Buffet price, I was hoping for a little more. I might be more interested in paying the lower price the rest of the nights.
