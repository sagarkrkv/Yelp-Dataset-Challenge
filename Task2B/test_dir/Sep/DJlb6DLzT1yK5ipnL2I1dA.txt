After a terrible experience at XS, my girlfriends and I decided to head over to Tryst. We had such a fun time! The music was hip hop and the crowd was sexy and fun. Jermaine Dupri came on and the crowd went crazy. It was a good time.
Shockingly fun. It's not a 'top tier' club but it's fun and all that matters. The drinks aren't outrageous (by Vegas standards), the music is 75% EDM, 25% Old School, which I like. It has a nice view of the water fountain, which is a nice touch.. . If you go fairly early, like until 11:30, you'll have no problem getting in, they're not very selective for sure. . . I was surprised at how relaxed the dress code is. You can get in with a t-shirt and jeans. I wish they'd up that a bit and they'd find a higher level of clientele. . . The staff was friendly and patient with us drunks.
I loved the waterfall inside of this club! This is definitely my favorite nightclub in Vegas. They have a huge dance floor and a long bar, what more can you ask for? Oh, the lovely waterfall INSIDE of the club, that's what. Just magnificent.
All I have to say about this place is that it is where my mom and my gf's mom like to go.
4 bottles between 5 people...I asked for water and our waitress told me I need to buy it. I need to pay for an $8 water after we dropped so much for 4 bottles at the table? Is Tryst really that money hungry?..I said that's fine, bring us water and I'll pay for it. Water was never brought. In the entire time we were at our table, our waitress came over maybe 4 times. Maybe. We pretty much took care of ourselves while she was busy dancing on stage and in the walkways. Maybe she should apply for a dancer position and tryst should hire legit waitresses....I've been to Vegas several times and this was very poor bottle service.
Best music during our weekend stay for a Flirty Thirty we celebrated in September. I would definitely come back. The location was a little bit smaller than I remember, but probably because I was a lot more sober. The waterfall and outdoor dancing was a nice touch. One of my top three club choices while in Vegas.
Never get shit face when asking a girl out, not a good idea.hahah. Nice club only with reserve table! . Get a table I promise you the girls will come! . I was surprise I met a few people that live near my area.
This place was great. We showed up late and they still comped out entry fee. Best looking waitresses by far! Tons of fun. Very pretty environment.
Still the prettiest club in Las Vegas. About a decade old but still fun. Staff is very pretty.
