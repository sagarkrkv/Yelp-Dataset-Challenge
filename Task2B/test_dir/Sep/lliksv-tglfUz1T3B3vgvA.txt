Was once a great place.. Now has jumped the shark.  Had a late dinner.  Felt very rushed to get us out the door.  Has lost its personal feel and now pushes out rushed average cuisine where once meals defined my Vegas trip.  . To add a personal touch.. We walked out with no thank you or good bye and the first thing we see is a new Benz parked in the first space with a LotusSiam licensed plate.  I guess owners car and if true very tacky.  . I'm all about making money but you better not lose what made you great in the first place.  I hope they focus on food and customer service in the future.
Always an hour or more wait but well worth it food is absolutely delicious in that restaurant is always packed
Expensive. Over rated. Long lines in the simmering desert heat. No thanks.. . One or two dish that is different. The deep fried prawn dish is good.. . Other than that, I would not recommend this place when there are so many restaurants in the desert.
It's in kind of a weird and creepy plaza, however I loved this place.  A couple friends brought me here and we dined family style.  Everything was tasty, especially the curry.  I am glad I came with friends who knew a little about thai food, because the menu is big and I would have been lost without them.
Just know that once you eat here your expectations will be very high.  I have been to SEVERAL thai restaraunts since moving from Las Vegas and have yet to find one where the food and service can match up.. The dishes are authentic, the flavor and spices are amazing (especially the Panang Curry), and the servers are extremely attentive.  . My advice is to come early or make a reservation because you WILL have to wait (even on a Tuesday night it can get crowded).. Don't be turned off by the sad strip mall and the pan handlers in the parking lot (especially the couple on their bikes)...it's what's inside that counts.
Damn Lotus of Siam, why is your food so damn expensive for these itty bitty portions!  When you think of Thai food, you think sweet, sour, spicy, and decent portions!  This place is definitely over-hyped and overrated.  . . The wait is long, but I'm sure most people already know and are prepared for that (The wait time for my large party was 2 hours.).  The dishes I admit are delicious, however I left very unsatisfied and still hungry. . . Garlic Prawns - These were quite delicious.  I hate that there are pieces that are empty.  Worth a try but not worth eating more than once, very simple dish that you can probably make yourself with a deep fryer.. . Papaya Salad - Nothing special here, don't get me wrong it is good (you can't really mess up with papaya salad).  Again such a small portion, what are they expecting to feed, a baby rabbit??. . Pad Thai - Tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.. . Soft Shelled Crab Drunken Noodle - The soft shelled crap was crispy, and alright.  This was okay for me, it was quite salty but the blandness of the greens evened it out.. . Sweet Coconut Rice, Fried Bananas - I enjoyed this very much however, again overpriced for something that tastes the same almost everywhere else.. . Tom Kah Kai Hotpot - The soup was delicious, however the chicken was like rubber!. . Honestly after my group finished our dinner, we were hella confused because all of the other good reviews.  We are from Cali and there are Thai restaurants everywhere, for the amount of our bill, we could have had good Thai food for a week!  Don't feed into the hype people, I'm sorry Lotus of Siam, you disappoint and probably are popular because all these people are being suckered by the other hyped reviews (a sad cycle).
Saw this place on Anthony Bourdain, and it is pretty good.  Really surprised on how well it was
James Beard award winning restaurant in a ghetto stripmall in Vegas? Why yes there is! Had to convince my friends and family to actually stop in but once we got there, sat down and tried their lunch buffet everyone was thanking me! One of the best Thai food places I've been and it was a buffet. I don't really like buffets because I'm always concerned about the freshness of the food. This place was amazing and crowded but the best pad Thai ever!
Thai food is not my first food choice but I could eat here every single day. . . No one cares about decor when the food is this good.
My definition of ZE BEST Thai restaurant in Vegas! I love love love their fried garlic prawns! It's a must have item on your order! We tried the crispy duck curry, sea bass with onion & ginger, soft-shell crab drunken noodle, pad see yew, tom yum goong seafood soup. They were all very delicious! For dessert, we tried the fried banana with coconut ice cream. The sticky rice & mango was out of season so we couldn't have it thus time. The experience was great, we love their food and service. Definitely will come back every time we're in town.
The best musaman curry in the in the country. I have had a lots of them.this is the best.
You guys have heard all the hype. All the awards, national media attention, the famous chefs of the world saying how great this place it. Now after a couple of visits I can confirm with all of them, LoS was probably one of the best meals of my life!. . I've read a lot of reviews about many of the other Thai places in town. And, a lot of people would rather chose those spots to eat at, rather than go to LoS which they feel is overhyped. I've been to a lot of those places as well.. So what's the conclusion? I don't think this place is overhyped at all. I believe that LoS deserves every single accolade it has received. It probably deserves more... . Places like Komol, Weera Thai, Pan Asian, Archi's etc. etc., they make really good, in fact, they make really great Thai food! LoS is completely on an entirely different level. For example, take the classic, drunken noodles. At all the great Thai restaurants, they all make excellent versions of this dish, and they each have a common trait that says "this is drunken noodles." At LoS, it still says  "this is drunken noodles", but it's totally different from every one I've ever had in my life. And, I mean different in a totally amazing, uniquely personal, life changing sort-of-way... That goes for EVERY dish on the menu. Also, if you haven't had the crispy prawns, do try them, quite possibly the best thing I've eaten this year (them prawn shells..). . Whenever I eat at a restaurant, I always come in with an open mind regardless of what others have experienced, positive or negative. This restaurant isn't just one of the best restaurants in Vegas or the entire country, this is a world class restaurant. This restaurant will continue to rack up the accolades, and deservedly so. Well done Lotus of Siam.. Well done!
Overpriced, overrated, and tiny....I mean tiny tiny portions. The deep fried prawns with the shells were great. Everything else was just ok. Pad thai wasn't your typical ketchupy tasting fast food pad thai but the portions were so small it was a joke. Same with the papaya salad and most of the people eating there were white. Think about that for a second. I'm not saying white folk don't know their Asian food but an Asian restaurant with no Asians eating there tells you something. Food was slow to come out but service was good. They kept coming back and checking on the table. Maybe one too many times in fact but I guess it's better than bad/no service. If you are looking to try the place because it was on tv by all means. Not a whole lot of value for your buck though. You can basically get just as good or better somewhere else. The difference if there is any is marginal at best.
I am glad I had a chance to visit this restaurant.  I never heard of this place, until my most recent trip to Vegas.  Dishes here are more expensive than the usual Thai restaurant.  In Vegas, you are going to be shelling out tons of money all over the place.  Maybe cut back on a few drinks at the club or a few lap dances less to save a few bucks to try this spot out if it would make you feel better. . . You will find some dishes here that you may not have encountered at other Thai restaurants.  This place gets real packed.  Non-stop taxi's dropping off people every minute it seems.  Make a reservation a day in advance if you have a large group.  There are very limited reservation slots.  . . Ordered the Sausage, Deep Fried Garlic Prawns, Fried Peking Duck in Panang, Thai Beef Salad, and Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass.  . . My favorites are:. . Deep Fried Garlic Prawns - nicely fried, battered, andgarlicky.  Enjoyed eating every part of the shrimp.  The skin is separated and deep fried as well.. . Fried Peking Duck in Panang - I normally do not eat duck because it has a certain taste, but there are certain meats or dishes that you may not generally like, however, prepared a certain way and you might just fall in love with it.  I certainly enjoyed this dish.  Maybe because it was fried and sliced into thin pieces with thick skin.  Throw it in panang curry and perfect fusion flavor.  Some in the group thought it was a bit oily and greasy, but I did not mind.. . Thai Beef Salad - rib eye beef, salad, and thai sweet lime dressing.  Tender beef, good sauce.  This was delicious. . . Sausage and the Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass were good, but were my least favorite.  Sausage had a lot of flavor, but I did not find myself enjoying it more than other sausages that I've had.  Sea bass was cooked well, thick piece, but standard.  The noodles with deep fried soft shell crab sounds something more to my liking.  Maybe I will be back to order that someday.
Don't let the curb appeal keep you from this restaurant. It's in a very unlikely location but the food is a good as it gets. Try the combo fried rice and the drunken prawns. Can't wait to go back. I recommend you have them bring out 1-2 things at a time. Otherwise they will bring it all at once and you can feel a bit rushed. Last thing bring you wallet. It's fantastic but you pay for it.
If you come to Vegas, you have to eat here.. .   Most importantly, the food is amazing. Thai food is my favorite and there is no better place than here. They give very generous portions for the prices you're paying and it tastes incredible. Everything I've tried here has been amazing. Your Vegas trip is not complete unless you eat at Lotus of Siam!!
Was in vegas for the weekend and with one night left, talked with my wife about nice places to go. I was thinking steakhouse, seafood/sushi, etc. Something expensive and fancy on the strip. She said a friend told her about a Thai restaurant(she loves thai and im starting to) that she HAS to go to. She called him to get the name, and we went to Lotus of Siam. Overall, absolutely phenominal. The duck in creamy curry(no clue what its actually called) was the best. Fried rice and garlic prawns great as well. Spent 40-50 on round trip cabs but it was worth it.
Great Thai food in an unsuspecting strip mall off the Vegas strip.. . My coworker took me here as he had been many times. I will definitely come back next time in VEGAS.
Excellent Panang curry with crispy duck, pad Thai, crispy rice, etc. Definitely better quality and service and price than any of those in the Strip. Extensive menu!
Came to LV for a trade show and wanted to dine near our hotel on Karen/Paradise.  Saw this place with great reviews & walking distance and decided to give it a try.  The walk was a little scary through a sketchy neighborhood - but well worth it!  I've never heard of Drunken Noodles before and my wife and I don't eat much Thai food, but these were awesome! Our waiter also recommended the charbroiled prawns, & pork satay.    We ordered a little too spicy at #8, but ate it up!  Excellent service as well.  We'll definitely be back.
I'm not sure what the negative comments are all about, but this was hands down the best Thai food I've ever had. I was in Vegas for a couple days and had to have a meal due to at least 5 recommendations from friends.. . The food was flavorful, crunchy and tender when needed, and portions not overly huge like most places. My friend and I shared the Mikrob and garlic prawns, and I had the crispy duck with drunken noodle. All were absolutely delicious!!
I frequently visit Las Vegas. With so many celebrity chef restaurants around the strip, This was the first time I had ever thought of trying Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. The restaurant wasn't too far away. It was approximately two miles away from the Stratosphere. It is located in a rather big plaza with plenty of parking. The restaurant exterior was not much to look at. However, the interior is decently decorated and clean. After looking at the menu, my initial thought was this place is way too expensive for Thai food. Gave it a try anyway. I had the famous curry duck and various other plate, Which I do not recall the name (please refer to my pictures). They tasted really good, and I would go back for more given a chance. I would have given this place a five stars if the price is a little lower.
Very good food. A staple in Vegas, leave the strip and go there. Everything is great. Eat here before it's too late
Dive of a location BUT great interior, quality food and great service-- Pelegrino water only comes in large for $7 - not bad but could be a shock if you're eating by yourself as i often do while business traveling . Their Fuji water may come in small bottle but ask
Now, I have seen Bourdain eat here, I've read up on the joint from various food blogs and on-line culinary magazines, but other than remembering to order from the Northern Thai section of the menu all other specific knowledge went out the window because I was so god damn drunk! Apparently, I am told, I couldn't even recall where the bathroom was despite the fact I had just relieved myself there only fifteen minutes prior.. . F*cking Slot Waitresses. F.S.W.. . But I did remember to take pictures dear readers and I can say everything we ordered was not only downright delectable but tasted just as good, if not better, than anything that I ate in the four weeks I spent in Thailand.. . Yes. I said it. And I stand by it with my FlavorBoner held high.. . . Nam Prik Ong (Red Chili Dip w/ groundpork) intended to be a starter to your meal, is not too spicy and has just the right amount of sweet from the ground pork. It is awesome with the crudites and chicharones served with it. The cool from the vegetables and the heat from the dip work really well together, even for a drunk ass like myself.. . Hey. It was a long drive, all right, and I was on a mission. So... whatever.. . . Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice) The center of the rice was perfectly moist and soft and the outside was sensationally crunchy. How they did that I have no idea. There was an overall wonderful ginger/lime flavor going on in this dish with flame coming from the green onion and fresh chilies.  Yum!. . . Sai Oua (Northern Style Sausage) Fresh, house made, Thai spicy pork sausage. Enough said. Either you get it or you don't. No need to sell it.. . "A guy don't walk on the lot lest he wants to buy!". . -- Alec Baldwin, Glengarry Glen Ross. . Garlic Prawn. Deep fried in their shell, this dish has a potato chip crunch to it and it's so frickin' garlicky. And I mean that in the best possible way. This is a not to be missed dish for those of you who do not dig anything with hoofs.. . Then there was our little crispy drunken Daffy, the Crispy Duck Drunken Noodle. The skin on the bird was indeed crispy and salty. Her meat tender and juicy. The vegetables were cooked yet firm and the bird-based broth that the slippery, wide noodles bathed in was the perfect compliment to the other spicy dishes as it smoothed everything out.. . Now not all of the dishes we ordered were from the Northern Thai portion of the menu that everyone recommended, some were chef's choices others, like the drunken noodle, were personal favorites.. . Just order what you want. It's your meal. Everything here will be good. You are not going to go wrong.
One great restaurant - don't miss it when visiting Las Vegas!  Very reasonably priced and we had very, very attentive service.  I'd give them six stars if I could!
Great authentic Thai food.  I love Garlic prawn and Larb Squid.  Food is great but a little bit overprice with small portion.  It's a very busy restaurant, make sure to make a reservation 2 days in advance ifnot you have to wait at least 2 hours.
Musamon curry with fried tofu and shrimp is amazing ! A friend who is a Thai food neophyte got the sweet and sour chicken . I was skeptical , but it was delicious , too .
Garlic prawns...With shells that taste like Potato chips...what is not to like. Make reservations or get here early to assure quick service because your mouth will be watering.
Aaaamazing Food! Great Wine Selection.. Get the Deep Fried Catfish and a bottle or two of NxNW red. :). Such a great night!
Waiting is worth it. Food, wine, atmosphere, THE BOMB!. . Highly recommend if you are in Vegas and want best food, best price.. . Not far off the strip, maybe a $12 cab ride from Wynn.. . Wine cellar is HUGE.
I heard about this place from Anthony Bourdain on his show. My husband and I love Thai food. We was very excited to try the best Thai food in America. . I am Thai and live in DC area. I gonna say only ok Thai restaurant in DC area much better than that. Curry has too much coconut milk test.  . . Service was ok and pricey.
Worthy of the hype! Here are my suggestions:. . 1. Make a reservation, or you're sure to wait about an hour (yes, even on a random Monday night).. 2. Order the drunken shrimp! Huge, juicy, flavorful shrimp with flat noodles. . 3. Spice levels are normal/reasonable, go with your gut! . 4. Dress casually; hella people come from the strip in taxis dressed like they're going to a $$$$ restaurant, but that's not necessary! . . Service is really nice and of course, the pad thai is also great. It's famous, you might as well give it a shot!
I found this place on yelp on a whim and knew I had to go here.. . All I can say is that if you like Thai food... You must try Lotus of Siam-- you won't know good Thai food until you do!
This place had been an wonderful experience for me and my wife. We are thai food lovers and can be sometimes too critical about the food quality. They have one of the best foods we have ever tested and also a lot of variations.
Some of the best Thai dishes I've ever had.
Ridiculously good Thai. . . Great service with full range of menu options. We shared the sea bass and some chicken plate that was fantastic.  You can dial up or down the heat as desired. . . If you are in the mood for thai.... This is It!
