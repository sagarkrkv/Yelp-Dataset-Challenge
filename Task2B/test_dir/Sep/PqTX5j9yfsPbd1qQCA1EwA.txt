This is my least favorite Vegas nightclub. It's too crowded to the point where I felt like a piece of cattle going from point A to point B. I do not enjoy being in close contact with strangers. I can feel their sweat on me. Gross. So many stairs too. I've been here twice and both unpleasant experiences.
This is still one of my favorite clubs in Vegas after all of these years.  The crowd is usually pretty good and they get some pretty good DJs over here.. . It's still a pain to get in if you're with a group of guys but it's nothing like a few years ago when Paris Hilton used to come here, etc.. . Table service is nice and the security guys are all pretty cool at keeping your bottle safe and the riff raff out of your area.
Ugh! I did come here on a Saturday of Labor Day weekend with Snoop Day playing so I should have known any club on the Strip but my god! . . Lining up stinks.  General admin was out the door where people were suffering through the heat.  Ladies only line was right next to a jewelry kiosk where we get in trouble for being close to the merchandise.  Maybe you should move the line? Just a suggestion.. . Trying to maneuver through the people waiting for the restaurant and the actual restaurant itself sucks.  . . The layout of the club sucks ass.  It was super crowded, I didn't even have enough room to wiggle!  Kinda ruins the fun times as well when there's security screaming in your ear to move when there's no where to go!  No room for me to find guys to hustle drinks from.  . . My friends and I left after an hour.  Not worth it.
Packed.. shuffled in,  shuffled out line was short to get in and cover was 20. A long walk from the entrance of the hotel.
Vary Poor customer Service from the front door to the Bartenders. The Worst of them Was the So Called Manager. they really all should take Customer Service 101 Training I Would Definitely Not Recommend Any One to Go There. Manager Should go Have His 200.00 Walmart Suit Pressed Out.
Club sucks..... They let too many people in and the security sucks. Worst experience ever. I felt bad for the people that didn't have VIP because it is impossible to get drinks.
Horrible security! Just went here last weekend on a Saturday night for the Snoopadelic  theme party and it was horrible! Our friend spent A LOT of money for a VIP booth (2 bottles of Dom perignon,  two bottles of grey goose and Crown, all the fixings and mixtures) and we had to leave early because of the craziness of the crowd and lack of security. We were in a bottom booth with one rope to try to reserve our section but after the club was packed it was impossible to keep strangers out of the booth. There was seriously pushing and shoving, drinks thrown when asked for people to get out of the section and we were forced to do all of this ourselves because there was no security in sight! It got to the point where I was actually scared thinking we could get trampled on! The staff was unprofessional, and did not acknowledge our initial concern of our safety when the rope continued to be pulled away due to  the crowd trying to walk through.  They allow way too many people in the club, there is no room to even dance anywhere, and the total ambiance that night was just negative to me. The girl  swimming in the huge glass was cool, but that was about it. I feel bad for anyone not in a VIP booth because I don't even know how you would get a drink. Never returning, very disappointed...and that's hard to do in Vegas.
I like Tao, but crowd control is where they lose major points. I've been to many very crowded nightclubs and this seems to be the only one that consistently gets it wrong. I'm surprised that there haven't been any serious injuries from people being crushed. I don't blame the security guys though. A problem this large and ongoing falls back on management.
