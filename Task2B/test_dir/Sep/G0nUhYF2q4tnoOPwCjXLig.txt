our room smelled like old moist!. linens were clean(hopefully) but were not clean white so you could imagine they were used and washed thousand times.. they charge you $20 resort fee for internet, alarm clock!, swimming pool,... but internet is wired!!. bathroom accessories are at the minimum: one small bar of soap, one conditioning shampoo(not separate), one body wash. no toothpaste, no tooth brush, no shower cap, .
I almost always stay at excalibur when I go to Vegas. I went this last Thursday and had booked a room for $22.00 a night (with my MLIFE rewards) when we got there to check in they upgraded us to a suite for free. I have NEVER stayed in a suite before so it was soooo nice and pretty. I loved it! There is so much food to choose from from all price ranges. This is actually my favorite place to play slots even tho I often walk to the other casinos. I am never disappointed with this casino.
MUST READ ENTIRE REVIEW . . One of the worst places to stay in Las Vegas. . . Its bait and switch here. The room showed online isnot the room you'll get.. . From the minute you walk in it will be regret if you stay here. The stinch of cigarettes and foul oder that reaks from the entire place will drive you crazy. On top of that the staff is horrible. You are honestly better off at a Motel 8. Hands down has to be the worst hotel on the strip. . . CONS:. -DIRTY. -NO WIFI. -PHONES GET NO RECEPTION. -FOUL ODER. -STRONG TOBACCO SMELL. -SPIRITS ARE WATER DOWN TO THE MAX. -TV CHANELS ARE HORRIBLE.         * No premium channels.         * Scattered blurry channels. -STAFF IS THE WORST. -ROOMS ARE IN HORRIBLE CONDITION. . . I've stayed at Motel 8, MGM Grand, and Aria. Without a doubt this hotel is horrible. . . Disgusting Popcorn ceilings, non-functioning irons, old foul sheets and blankets. . . I choose this hotel to save money and would of rather spent the extra $50 to go elsewhere. Reviews are bad here for a reason .... Don't make the mistake I made.
Its nice place, especially for people who love spa.
You get what you pay for here! Not my ideal choice of Hotel to stay at in Las Vegas, but for the price it is not too shabby! Guest parking is horrible if you're coming here during the weekend or over the holidays. Valet is also jammed packed during these high peak times so drivers beware!. . Kids everywhere & mediocre rooms. The outdoor pool (Drenched) is okay. 3 pools, music (DJ's), poolside food service, and bar.. . The only plus is that Dick's Last Resort resides here! It's the restaurant/bar where the waiters & staff are rude to you on purpose. There are a whole bunch of Dick's here, but it is a blast! Be prepared to laugh, or cry.. depending on how sensitive you are.
Let me preface this review by stating I have stayed at Excalibur many times.  Prior to this stay Excalibur was one of my favorite hotels in Las Vegas.  I have been going to Vegas for the last 15 years.  Excalibur was an easy four star review for me, but has been going downhill.  Since I didn't join Yelp! until recently, this is my first review.  So here is the rundown:. . 1.  When I drove in cones were everywhere.  It blocked off various areas and made everyone confused.  When I drove in the valet part of the parking lot, I was yelled at.  Already a bad impression.. . 2.  I went to check in at around noon.  I was told my room wasn't ready.  I was fine with this since check-in is at 3PM.  However, the person at the counter said it may not be until 4 or 5PM.  This I had an issue with since I had show tickets that night.  I asked for the manager and I complained about the first issue and this issue.  The manager totally ignored the first issue, and with the second issue she kept saying it would be at 3PM.  I said I was confused since the previous person said it may not be until 4 or 5.  Then the person who was helping me said she never said that!  So I was already disgusted.  They said they would put a rush on my room.  I said it's not necessary since I was told it would be ready by 3PM.  They did anyways, though.  The manager wasn't too friendly.  She seemed more annoyed that I had a complaint.. . 3.  So with our luggage in hand, I checked some of it in while we waited.  My party and I decided to go get lunch at the buffet.  Keep in mind I already saw advertisements for their buffet.  So what do we see when we talk up to it?  The buffet is closed for renovations.  I'm so glad we were told that at check-in.  Oh wait, nowe weren't.  We weren't told a thing about it.  So we walked over to the Luxor instead.  The buffet was closed the entire trip.  We were able to eat at other places, but it was annoying.  They posted ads everywhere about their buffet even after I checked it.  It was on their channel on the TV, on posters, etc.. . 4.  Once we got our rooms and settled in, I did my usual inspection.  The AC wasn't working at all and I discovered it had not been defrosted.  So I had to take care of that in order to have a decent nights sleep in the room.  The TV didn't work right half the time either.  Sure, you don't come to Vegas to watch TV, but sometimes you need to.  The room was decent otherwise.. . 5.  Now for the most part I broke even when I was gambling, but there were some annoyances on the casino floor.  There were hardly any waitresses around to take drink orders.  I waited a good 10 minutes to find someone to take my order, then another 10 to get my drink.  However, there were plenty of people around to ask me if I wanted a "M Life" card or whatever their card is.  I go to Vegas about once a year, maybe once every couple years.  So I don't want the damn card.  But they didn't stop asking.  I finally blew up at one of the people and said I am tired of being asked and I wanted to be left alone.  They said it was their job. The other annoyance is that they had other people on the floor pushing show tickets and other crap.  It was the worst I have ever seen.  I went to other casinos and did not have these issues, so it could be an Excalibur thing.  However, the dealers at the tables were nice and the casino floor was clean.  A friend of mine did have someone, possibly a prostitute, hit on him when he was gambling at 4AM.  So security could be better.. . I picked Excalibur since I love castles, dragons, etc.  However, I won't be staying again in the future unless I see some of these issues are resolved.  I'll visit for the shops, the wonderful Tournament of Kings show, etc.  But I felt like I received horrible treatment by the employees there.  They were more concerned about making money rather than making sure I was satisfied.
This place has lots of mixed reviews. I never wanted to stay here because of them. I came across a very good deal on Priceline for last week (Tuesday-Friday) and my Husband and I decided to take that chance. Oh well, you usually don't spend time in the room right? We arrive, no line at the registration counter as we are checking in 3 hours prior to our check-in time our customer service represenative "waives" the $20.00 early-in fee (SCORE!), we walk to our room and the room smelled good (non-smoking), high floor (28), and a very nice view of the strip! We got the cheapest room, $48.00 a day including the $20.00 resort fee. Our King bed was so comfy, carpet was cleaned, TV worked and was big, bathroom was big and clean, the towels were soft, white and had no stains. we LOVED our stay and espeically for the price! Thank YOU EXCALIBUR!
I booked on Priceline for $39/ night and am very impressed.  The room is clean and as nice as any other room I've stayed at on the strip.  The beds are comfy and I have a great view.  Kristi at the activities desk is amazing and went above and beyond to make sure I had a great stay.
The Spa was wonderful. All the staff were great, supper service. Clean well run.. After returning from a Alaska fishing trip my body was sore. Two trips to the spa & all was well.. . Mahalo  Stan :)
first let start out by saying i will never stay at this establishment ever again with how we were treated when we stayed there from aug 16th - aug 22nd of 2014. . it started on sunday when my girlfriend started waking up with bites on her legs and ankles and feet then just went from there. . they kept coming more and more each day and to no avail till tuesday when she couldn't make it to work for the trade show we were up there for she finally went to the hospital to have the bites checked out. it ended up being bed bugs in which if you look it up there is 34 now 35 claims of bedbugs  at this establishment in the last year with nothing being done...they said they will have eco lab do a test on the room and it came back with no results of there being bed bugs  but when we asked for a copy of the report they said it was an internal issue and we could not have a copy of the report...in my eyes they are trying to hide the truth by not giving me a copy of the report. we left that thursday the 22nd and had to get all of our personal belongings and all my salesmen samples dry cleaned at my own expense and now have a sample bill for all my samples being as we turn them in to be put back in inventory to be sold now being as they were dry cleaned we can no longer do that....my vehicle also had to be professionally detailed to make sure the contamination did not spread to it when we arrived back home as well. . . there only thing they offered us was tuesday night after my girlfriend came back from the hospital which we also paid at our own expense and her loss of wages for missing work while being at the hospital was an upgrade to a suite which at this point was ridiculous at this point we just wanted to leave but we still had work to be done the following 2 days up there...they also were to refund stuff to my cc on file which at first it was going thru then 2 days after we arrived back home the money was taken back out of my account...we have tried to resolve this issue with them before having to contact a attorney but they will not take phone calls from either myself of my girlfriend which in my eyes is horrible customer service and just down right wrong in my eyes.... . now almost 3 weeks later we are out for loss of wages, 2 completes salesmen sample lines and garment bags that cannot be taken back to resell and a complete detail on my personal vehicle due to not wanting it to spread to my personal vehicle and hospital bills that they do not want to compensate us for anything at all for any of it nothing...all in all upwards of over $10000 dollars out of pocket and nothing being done on there behalf and this is a mgm establishment to top it off.... . i have stayed at numerous hotels in my lifetime in las vegas and this by far was the worst experience ever in staying someplace in las vegas...not even old hotels in vegas are this bad....as you can google bed bugs reports and claims and they are the worst in vegas at this point...who wants to come to vegas to end up getting bit up and have to spend time in the hospital instead of actually either working on having a vacation like your there for.... . so to end all of this i wish i could give this report negative stars in stead of the one i gave them but it is not possible to do so..so whom ever in the near future thinks about staying at this hotel beware of the bed bugs as they are in this establishment and they will do nothing for you other then give you a suite for the tenure of your stay in a contimated hotel in which they say isnt but wont provide test results to anyone who has made claims of it...
The rooms are great if you get what you want. You make a reservation for like a non smoking king room and they can't at all guarantee that you will get a king size room but instead 2 queens bed or a king bed. This is not at all the right way to do business. My wife and I got married 18 years ago at the Excalibur as we were going to stay there again but if they can't guarantee your room preference after making a reservation I would go elsewhere.
I loved staying here. Parking sucks though. . . Everything else was great. Room was clean, check in was nice and speedy, the pool was awesome, and the restaurants in the hotel itself are also good. . . Book early on and get great pricing. I would stay here again, but then again there are so many other hotels in Vegas!
I had a wonderful stay here. The check in was really fast and the price was great! Really cheap prices with really great service! The room was also really clean. My next vegas trip I'll definitely be staying here again.
Nicer on the outside that on the inside, but not bad by any means. We did not encounter any bedbugs, to the best of our knowledge. The best thing about the experience was the midweek price.
I've tried others, and they may give out more perks, but they never compare to the service and experience I get at the Excalibur. Every department is managed to the tee. Our experience at the pool cafe and cabana this trip was better than ever, with each employee giving 110% to make sure we were happy. Maybe I'm spoiled, but it sure is nice to be addressed by my last name whenever I encounter an employee. How do they always know?: Great management!
I stay here every time I go to Vegas.. Not my choice (as my family chooses) but honestly, as a 24 year old male, it's not bad.. I don't party in Vegas, but if I did, this wouldn't be a bad place to stay. . It's affordable, there's a massive food court, and if you happen to party a bit too hard, it's on the strip with a walkway escalator to take you back into the hotel so you don't have to stumble back home.. . There's an arcade and 'knights of the court' show that's great for kids. . Poker room is ok. MGM is better (and Excalibur is within a five minute walk).. . Highly underrated due to the fact that it doesn't have that cool Vegas-y feel. But I do appreciate the nuances that many miss out on.. . Oh, and Baja Fresh. Nice place to eat for a cheap dinner.
I did get an email from guest relations at the Excalibur admitting that they can't at all guarantee their rooms as rooms are assigned when you check in. I do not understand as to what the purpose of a reservation is if you can't get the type of room you want. Things were a lot better when Circus Circus once owned this property and now it is run and operated by MGM Mirage which own several properties around town. I would not even bother going to any MGM Mirage properties in Vegas as you will not get the room you want and plus you will have to fight them to get your money back weather you stay there or not.
Excalibur is an economical option to stay on the strip. Nothing fancy here. The rooms are outdated, but it served its purpose of being a place to sleep after packed days of Las Vegas activities.. . There are a lot of quick food options. We stayed in Tower II and there's a Baja Fresh right next to the elevators in the lobby. I ate there twice and it was one of my more reasonable meals during the trip. . . The only thing that really bothered me was being charged fees to receive packages at the hotel. I've stayed at many hotels while on business and have never paid any fee to accept a package. For a hotel that also has a "resort fee", I'd think this would be a complimentary service for their guests.. . I'd probably stay here again, but will definitely consider other options as the rates aren't that competitive to some other hotels on the strip.
Ok, so I give about 3.5-3.7stars. I'm not sure the little things I took off for are that important. The casino smells funny... Bad funny. It's not pricey so there are a lot of families and young tweeners. The restaurants are all chain so I didn't bother, but if you like the comforts of home then it's kinda cute. For example, I love jalepeno Cheetos and the little kiosk by my elevators had them stocked as well as a friendly staff.  The rooms had the little amenities I appreciate- towel racks on the back of the door, good lightening in it, clean showers with plenty of hot water and a good shower head, a good fan. I stayed elsewhere and had to pay for a gym... I'm a gym rat and this FREE hotel gym is awesome! The pool was great too. Chairs were good and plenty of space, ample towel size and thickness, bar and waitress service poolside, cabanas if you wanted. The spa was nice too but I didn't partake in any services. The tram is pretty close and easy to use. Wi-Fi is only free and available in the lobby and pool which is not clear when booking so be advised. I needed it in my room and think all hotels should provide it as standard.
Both times I have stayed at Excalibur were great.  They have old rooms and updated rooms, Starbucks, different games for every budget, 4-pools, and accommodating maintenance.  Having MLiFe rewards helps with discounts on rooms, so we take advantage of the deals.  Would recommend if there are good deals available as you don't have to worry about putting too much money upfront for a decent place to stay and play.
