Place to be in Las Vegas. Don't miss on the rides here, if you love thrill.. Hotel room was Ok for night stay but did not had a refrigarator...
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #7:. this was a pleasant surprise; after touring the casino area, which to me has a bit of an outdated feel (even though the Strat only dates back to 1996), I wasn't too impressed and was ready to give it a "3" rating at best; but then found a pretty good place to eat called McCall's Heartland Grill, and a semi-decent shopping level (who knew?); but the clear drawing card here is the tower (duh!); first of all, go outside on the street level and look up at it - very impressive!; then just tell them that you're going up to one of the bars (107 Lounge or AirBar) and you get a fast elevator ride, from which you can even access the outdoor observation deck for free; truly amazing 360 degree views of the valley; and you can watch the lunatics bungee jumping and going on the crazy rides; I easily spent an hour up here; best craft brew bet = few & far between, but McCall's has a few on tap
I can't believe where I stay. How they can keep that hotel in vegas, and why they said: hotel, its really Motel. Room without any comments... Management you need really renovation immediately or go out of business. When you do check in before 3pm, they charge you 10.00$ its not normally. Cheap & Old Motel.
Wir waren zum ersten Mal in Las Vegas, und haben das Hotel auch aufgrund des gunstigsten Preises gebucht.. Sehr zu empfehlen ist das Buffet im Untergeschoss.. Das Hotel war sauber und die Zimmergroe war uberdurchschnittlich.. Was uns aber gestort hat ist, dass das kostenlose WLAN sehr schlecht funktionierte. Wir hatten immer wieder Verbindungsabbruche und nach einem halben Tag ist es auf zwei iPhones nicht mehr moglich gewesen zum WLAN zu verbinden.. Naja und jetzt noch zur Lage:. Das Hotel wird oft angepriesen dafur dass es auf dem strip liegt.. Als wir am Flughafen ankamen und Ein Shuttle Bus nehmen wollten, mussten wir aber 8,50 $ zahlen, also die Gebuhr nach down Town und nicht auf den strip.  Da waren wir schon etwas skeptisch.. Wir wussten dann aber schnell warum wir die erhohte Gebuhr zahlen musste.. Das Hotel befindet sich ganz am Ende des Strips wenn nicht sogar schon auerhalb des Strips.. WM aber WLAN und die Entfernung egal ist fur fur den ist das Hotel absolut empfehlenswert, es war sauber und alle waren sehr zuvorkommend. Ein weiterer Pluspunkt ist, dass Hotelgaste umsonst den Tower besuchen konnen. Alles in allem fur den Preis o. k. aber auch nicht mehr.
My husband and I came for a little getaway and to get married. So we decided to stay at the stratosphere. At first we thought it might just be a what ever hotel we had never been inside of it. I thought that because of the awesome price it must have a down side. Well as soon as we got there there is valet parking very nice and helpful young men always smiling. We walk in to check in hassle free we were there maybe 5 min and had someone take care of us and we upgraded our room to an amazing view! The bathroom was very nice so was the room very cozy and neat and nicely decorated too.  The atmosphere is very loud in the casino but the room was nice and quiet the first night we got married had a great time we went up to the tower. It's free to go up when you stay at the hotel the lounge there is so amazing it has a breath taking view of he whole city and your mouth just drop open in amazement! Although if your not to good with heights your legs will get a tingle in them lol my husband was Afraid bit got over it the next day. The hotel it's self has so many things to keep you occupied. Our second night we were out and about the city and it's very easy to get back and forth from the hotel every thing is close. We came back to the hotel to see the pin up show it's great music dancers and the men love it since the girls get to show a little more but not every thing  as a women I enjoyed it very much the music and dancing is just great!  Today was our check out date and let me tell you it was even faster than the check in! If I could give more stars I would it's great I loved it and will definitely recommend to friends and family . Thank you stratosphere for making this an unforgettable stay!
My boyfriend, a few friends and I did a one night stay-cation here.  I.would really give the hotel a 3 1/2 star rating.  It was a reasonable price.for a weds night stay.  If you are a guest at the stratosphere you are allowed access to the observation deck and lounge.  The view is worth checking out, I wouldn't get on any of the $$$ rides.. . Stratosphere is right in the center between downtown and the main part of the strip.  It can be a little sketchy at times.  I had a lady who hit me up for a dollar more than once and a guy who kept trying to sell me discounted cigarettes out of a plastic bag. Eh, that's how people in that neighbourhood behave at times.  A little riff raff but usually security seems too catch most.people.bothering.people who are just trying to gamble in peace. Just don't offer anyone help or money and you'll be fine.
This had to be the worse hotel I ever stayed at!!!! I didn't expect Bellagio accommodations, but I certainly didn't expect Motel 8 either. I paid for the upgrades but I had a view of Denny's not the strip as paid and the room was so small I just wanted to cry. The elevator was broken so we had to wait in line to get on and that wasn't even that big of an issue since it was Vegas I was in no rush to get to my room but never, never, ever will I stay here again.

I live in Las Vegas and so I try to take guests who come to visit to fun and interesting places.  We have friends visiting from the UK so last Wednesday we thought it would be fun to go to this property and head up to the Level 107 Lounge to watch the sun set over the desert.  I turned our car over to the valet and we headed up to the lounge.  And wanting to be fair, we had a great time up there.  our server, Irene, was amazing and the view was indeed spectacular.  . . After enjoying ourselves for a few hours, we headed back down to collect our car.  After handing our claim check to the attendant, we waited only a few minutes before he returned, but our car was nowhere in sight.  He approached me and told me there was a problem with the rubber strip on the bottom of the front bumper and it was coming off.  I asked to see my car and he led me to an area  around the corner with no lighting where he had parked it after retrieving from the valet lot.  It was dark and difficult to see, but he was correct, the strip on the right side of the bumper was loose and laying on the ground.  I asked what they were going to do about it (it was not damaged when I delivered it into their care, although they would later claim it was).  He said security would have to be called and a report made and asked if I wanted to do that.  I said of course and so I waited for security... and waited.  . . When he finally rolled up on his bicycle, I was treated rudely.  He asked me to fill out a form with a statement as to what had happened.  In the meantime, he took photos of my car (I had already taken mine while I waited for him to arrive).  I handed him my signed statement and then asked if when I would be contacted. He said I could call Risk Management (which is Straro-speak for, "We are going to screw you") tomorrow morning after 8:00 AM but could or would not provide me with a name or a phone number to call.  Not to worry, I speak Google.  . . I called Risk Management to following morning well after 8:00 AM giving them plenty of time to review the report I made as well as a report security made and was connected to a young man named Mike who said he didn't refuse to give me his last name but wouldn't in spite of multiple requests for him to do so.  He informed me the hotel was denying the claim because the damage preexisted when I dropped the car off to them.  That's interesting because the valet asked my spouse while I was with security if the car was damaged before and they were told in no uncertain terms that it was not.  Mike also was rude and condescending much like the security  person the previous night.  I think this must be a corporate core value.  . . Here's the funny part (at least to me).  The damage is minor and will cost less than $150 to repair, and only that much because the strip that needs replacing is a dealer part.  So they seem intent on chasing away my business and that of my friends who come to visit.  It's really okay with me.  Any business that refuses a $150 claim at the expense of chasing off $800-$1000 worth of business from me and my friends annually deserves exactly what they get.  The High Roller at the Linq will replace the spectacular views.
just stayed at the stratosphere for 10 days.......and my room was very clean...bed was comfortable . pretty helpful and attentive staff.great price (except the extra $200+ resort fee) we also enjoyed the pin up show...and the fact they turn the theatre into a great spot to watch nfl games on sunday.....AAA++++...i'll b back
Was truly looking forward to this stay.  Booked over the phone since I was not able to book multiple rooms.  Was promised a king-sized bed in each.  When checking in (Longer than it takes at LAX--and on a Monday) was told there were none available.. . Asked if they could apply my Senior discount, and was told that there was no such thing.  I said I don't know what you're talking about, look at your website.  He then came back and said you're already getting a 30% discount and the senior discount is only 10%.  I said that's not true.  The rate I paid is 17% less than what your site quotes as your "Regular" rate.  The site also promises a Senior discount on top of the rate you select.  Could he apply it now?  "No sorry, once you've checked in I can't do anything.". I'm not quibbling about their prices per se, but their dishonesty and lack of respect for their guests.  Go to someplace honest!
