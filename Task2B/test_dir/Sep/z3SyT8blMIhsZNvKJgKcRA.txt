My first time staying here. My husband got a three nights standard complimentary room at the Roman tower, a $125 credit for food or drinks plus $125 for gaming (blackjack or slot machines) I know it's free, but I was disappointed with their rooms I was expecting a lot nicer looking room than this for Caesar. The music from the street woke me up around 3am and didn't finish until 4:37am. We stayed at Bellagio (standard room) and it was way nicer.
We stayed here 08/16 - 08/20 and stayed in the Roman Tower. I WILL NOT STAY HERE AGAIN! this is a very old and tired building the rooms were dirty and the hallways show it's age! The main casino was nice, but bang for the buck the Cosmopolitan Is Much Nicer! Pool side drinks are 25.00 each and the pool closes early! We were so looking forward to this hotel, but unless you stay in the NOBU section you will be disappointed!
Stayed here in Aug 2014 and loved it. . . 1- the pool is awesome. 2- parking is huge, plentiful, and free. 3- rooms are nice, not super fancy but nice. 4- location is excellent . 5- check in and check out is easy as can be. 6- service is excellent . . I'll stay here again and again
This flagship of Caesars Entertainment has seen better days.  The Corporation should change it's name back to Harrahs Entertainment because that is the quality you are now getting at Caesars Palace.  My wife and I are both Diamond Total Rewards players, we come to Caesars quite often from Florida.  The following is what we have experienced just the last 3 visits within a year; the bed box spring out of it's frame and refusing to fix it, broken heater, broken lamps, room not the cleanest, room requested not available(normal), mattress quality very inferior, and rude Casino Hosts.. . The Restaurants at Caesars are often quite busy,the quality is hit or miss at any one on any day, except for Mesa Grill, which has been excellent at every meal every time.
Caesars promotes the image of being classic and extravagant. It's certainly one of the largest and oldest casino/hotels on the strip and represents old-world charm. . . I got a free upgrade to the Augustus tower. It is one of the newer towers, so I expected it would have modern upgrades. Granted, the room has a spa tub and granite tile shower with a large shower head. However, Caesars fails to meet expectations by the small TV in the main room area, a tv in the bathroom that is not hooked to the same cable tv system as the main tv, a Keurig coffee make without any coffee supplies, and most importantly, a place where most hotels fail in this age of mobile devices, there is a huge lack of power outlet locations for charging devices. . . In Vegas, be ready to walk, and Caesars is no exception. The parking lot is far away and the forum shops are long stretches of mazes. . . Just because of where you are, expect to pay more. As if Starbucks coffee weren't expensive enough, Caesars Starbucks charges double the price in many cases. . . One thing I like about Caesars is that at the blackjack table, I can play two hands without having to bet double the minimum. Also, this is one of the few places that still shuffles by hand, giving you that mental break in between shoes. That's one classic part of Vegas they need to keep. . . The problem with many casinos is the shift to eye-candy dealers like their Pussycat Dolls blackjack area where they take away the players' margin of winning by paying blackjack at 6-to-5 instead of 3-to-2. Sure sometimes the dealers are nice to look at, but don't play at those tables.
Compared to other Hotels such as the Cosmopolitan in the area, this hotel rates poorly on all the following:. . + Rooms: Dirty, old and dark - food found under the bed and toiletries remaining from the previous guest were found in the shower. Leading us to believe that the only thing that had been cleaned were the beds (or so we hoped). When addressing this with the staff they did nothing. +Convenience: You will be charged a $200 room deposit that will take 5 - 7 business days to return. The Cosmopolitan is $150 and the funds are released immediately upon checkout. . +Late Check Out: The latest you can check out is 12 pm, at the Cosmopolitan check out is 2 pm . +Service: Staff will prioritize conversation among themselves vs. checking in guests. Check-in took 20 minutes with no one in line before us.. . We were just there over labor day weekend and the hotel was slow compared to other hotels in the area. If you are looking for good guest service, nice rooms, and the convenience of a late check out given that you are in Vegas, do not book at Caesar's palace.
Rooms are outdated and the restaurants Gordon's appears run down like the waitresses.
I loved this place! The mall is crazy cool! Old cars roped off on the first floor. Statues come to life ever 30 minutes or so. That is a must see! Freaked me out at first......lol! Loved it big time.
I didnt even stay in the rooms and this place was BOMB! lol I love vegas and all parts of the strip! Step dad took us here just to site see and I loved it...alitte to busy for comfort but like i said i didnt see the rooms just the shops plus it was a saturday! I wil be back for the rooms though ;)
#1150 review written up for www.yelp.com- woo-hoo!. . On the parking garage- FREE parking but yes, it is crowded, especially on the weekeds- Tip: park on the roof for a nice view of The Strip (take that selfie). . . On the Forum Shops- since the expansion; another wing of three floors of stores was added. It's huge! And navigation is sometimes tricky, you gotta use the elevator for access to certain floors. Or the escalators, on that note. Some of the STORES include: Sony (the only one in Las Vegas), Burberry, Christian Dior. Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi, Gianni Versace, Gucci, Hublot, Louis Vuitton, Salvatore Ferragamo, Tiffany & Co., Valentino. I can't list them all, or else I'd run out of space!. . Lots of restaurants in the casino (kind of past the parking garage elevator entrance/exit into the casino, it's elevated) and in the Forum Shops, DINING includes: Beijing Noodle No. 9, Bradley Ogden, Central by Michel Richard, Cypress Street Marketplace, Empress Court, Hyakumi, Lago Buffet, Mesa Grill, Munchbar, NOBU Restaurant, Old Homestead Steakhouse, Payard Patisserie & Bistro, Raos, Restaurant Guy Savoy, Serendipity 3.. . Pools- there are six of them, including the Venus pool. . Some example of past Entertainment: elton john, absinthe (variety show), matt goss, jerry seinfeld (comedy), celine dion (recently cancelled residency, or postponed it), rod stewart, shania twain, russell peters (comedy), jeff dunham (comedy). . On the casino decor and theme, it's changed over the years. I liked the themes back in the day (referring to most of the casinos on the Strip as well), but seems like the new direction is what my husband calls "Yuppie." Same thing with the cocktail waitress outfits, those have evolved too. I used to party at Cleopatra's Barge where local music lounge groups performed such as Jonathan & Music Magic (which was a hotspot for hookers back in the 1990s). Am I dating myself? Uh-oh! Another thing, not sure, if I saw it the last time we came here, but there used to be a man and a woman wearing costumes at the entrance of the Forum Shops; tourists could take pictures with them; I have some of those pics somewhere. On the casino size, seems a little small, especially in comparison with the shopping part of the property.. Wonder, overall, if this property being featured in "The Hangover" gave it more exposure.    . . I used to come here whenever visitors from out of town would want to see the Strip and/or walk around. And you know what? My family and I still come here to check it out from time to time  too (though it's not as often). One time we ran into a past co-worker of my husband's, who is now a police officer. Typical Vegas, you have to expect bumping into someone you know.
Worst hotel I have ever stayed at in the context of customer orientation. 12$ for coffee pods in the room; 25$ for fitness center!!!??? Unbelievable in this day and age that Las Vegas in spite of such high volume of tourism still allows such atrocities by the hotels.  On top of it the hotel has become old and the hallways are stinky by the stores. Never will I stay here again.
I stopped by here the last time I was in Vegas because we went to eat at the Bacchanal Buffet. This casino is pretty big. I'm not really a fan of their layout as it is spaced out and there is a lot of waste space inside. They have a lot of table games located by the hotel lobby in a circle. They have more table games in the back end of their casino on the way to the shops, but the layout isn't that great to me. They have the forum shops located in the end of the casino. The forum shops have some free entertainment and food places as well. They have some shows there. I think when we went, Jerry Seinfeld was there. But it usually is Shania Twain or Elton John. They also have another show Absinthe there as well.. . They have Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill, which is decent. Serendipity is also in the front of the casino next to the strip. This place has a good location as it is walking distance to a lot of nearby casinos. I haven't stayed here in a while so I can really review the hotel itself. But the casino and restaurants are good. Good place to stop by if you've never been to vegas.
I made a reservation at this hotel a week ago through Booking.com. I found it through a Google search for "Vegas Hotels that allow Pets," because I have a dog.  . . When I made the reservation, I specified that I will have a small dog with me. In the interim, I received 3 emails from Ceasars. Not one mentioned the dog, so I thought I was all set. . . I was wrong. I tried checking in today, and the manager, Andrew Alicea, an arrogant, off-putting man, informed me that I will need to pay an additional $75 a night on top of my room charge, because I did not inform the hotel in advance that I will be bringing a dog. . . I told Andrew that I did --  I wrote it in the comments section. Andrew said those comments were read by Booking.com and not the hotel... I asked him how was I supposed to know that. He insisted that at the time of the reservation I should have booked a "pet friendly" room. It didn't matter that I had no idea that there was even an option of that ilk. . . I told Andrew I was leaving. At first, he said he couldn't rerun my money. Then, he actually looked at the reservation (first time that he did that), and said: "oh, I can rerun you. You were only charged for one night." . . I called my bank. I was charged for two nights. Now, I need to figure out how to get credit for the second night. And oh, yeah, I had to find another pet friendly hotel without an advanced reservation, and after driving into Vegas for 5 hours. . . Not fun.. . Follow up: I got a call from Andrew's supervisor, a Ms. Morales. She promised to give me a free dog friendly room for two nights whenever I returned to Vegas. I called her three weeks later. I also emailed. Never heard back. Nothing. Nada. Apparently, they seriously don't care about their guests...
This casino is really poorly designed! It was hard to find the casino when we came in off the boulevard. Had to ask directions twice. You would think they would want us to find the casino easily! Then tried to find a cocktail and several places were closed. A place with happy hour told us that we could only sit at the bar if we weren't eating. Finally found a place and the guy took our order and then said he didn't know how to make the drinks. Great resort for shops, just not for gambling or drinking. I guess 1 out of 3, ain't bad?
I like this hotel. It is old school and a bit upscale. They of course update things as required to stay up with the times. I like the Roman theme quite a bit, it still does not get old to me. The rooms are nice, especially if you get a suite. It was good sized, comfy and quiet when we wanted to sleep. The in house dining is quite good, as are the attached Forum Shops. The nightclub is great, other than the waiting to get in. You really can't go wrong here.
If it weren't for the trouble of my key this place would get a better rating. Both my key cards didn't work so I had to go back to the front desk. It was such a hassle because the room I was given was on the farther end of the hallway and dragging my heavy luggage wasn't all that great.
We arrived at Caesars with our three daughters and their boyfriends to get our 4 reserved rooms for our once a year family vacation.  Only one room was ready at 3:30pm, so all 8 of us hung out in that room.  By around 4:30 they finally brought us the keys to two more rooms.  We gave those rooms to our daughters.   My husband and I waited until almost 6pm (we arrived a before 1pm) and finally called down to see if our room was ready.  It was!  So I happily went down to pick up the keys.  Then I went upstairs, put the key in the door, and walked in on two people in bed.  Mortified, I apologized and left.  Went back down to the front desk and talked to the same incompetent woman who checked us in  and gave me the wrong key (Emma), and she didn't even know which room the was supposed to be our 4th room!  Asked for the manager (David), who was able to figure it all out.  Asked for the contact # of the head of the front desk staff, he told me a woman's name.  Then he gave me the contact info for a man (Tyler) instead because "the head woman is too hard to reach".  Got up to our room finally at almost 7pm and found a room that was smaller than the other 3 rooms and no king bed :(. Very sorry start to our weekend.
Just saw the Matt goss show.  Wow!!!!    Talk about old school Vegas with a modern twist!!!   What a show.....people please See This show....worth every penny.  OMGosh.   The brother from across the pond Can sing!!!!
Caesars Palace is one if the largest and best known hotels in Vegas.  I have stayed here and it was lots fun.  Huge casino that actually has single deck black jack (the other is Hard Rock) forum shops are awesome and connected to Caesars.  Central on the strip and was great for us to gamble and sit in the sports book.  The rooms are pretty basic and reasonable.  I like Caesars, I love the Bellagio that is next door. Two different atmospheres, Caesars is more party mode.  It was perfect for the Vegas bachelor party I went on :) Sushi bar Hyakumi located across from Cleopatras Barge was pretty good but pricey,  the best news I have read is that the highly acclaimed Nobu brand brings the world's largest Nobu Restaurant space to Caesars Palace Las Vegas in the heart of Nobu Hotel. The 11,200 square foot dining area and adjacent lounge features a sushi bar, private dining area and circular central bar. It's also the only U.S. Nobu offering teppan tables. With a menu that pleases the most sophisticated of palates, feast on imported Asian and Japanese fish, imported seafood, sushi rolls and exotic delicacies. I love NOBU and there is one at Hard Rock, hard to believe another is just down the strip!!
This is another Caesars Entertainment property that is centrally located on the Strip. The hotel is huge, so expect to do some walking and exploring. There are multiple towers to the hotel some are closer to the casino, some to the pool, and some are closer to the meeting rooms,. This can help if you are staying for business, pleasure, or both. The Palace Tower elevators have direct access to the meeting halls and pools, whereas the newer Octavius and Augustus Towers are near the pools but is farthest from the meeting halls. The Forum Tower is closest to the Colusseum but has no direct access to the pool or meeting halls without having to go through the casino.. All that aside, the rooms are excellent. Comfortable beds and some of the best pillows I've put my head on. The showers are awesome (one of the things that I really think makes a hotel stand out) since most rooms have these dual head showers (over head rainfall and wide spray front showers). And the TV in the bathroom.. There are plenty of food options, including room service. I will say this, if you are a foodie or just want to eat a lot, make sure to visit the Bacchnal Buffet. it is rated #1 by USA Today for a reason. The food is great, you have hundreds of selections from different cuisines, just be sure to wait at times since the line to go in may be up to an hour or more to get seated, unless you have a Diamond or Seven Stars players card.  As a local, I feelits a little overrated, but its a must try just to say you did it.. Parking can be an issue, especially on the longer weekends during the summer or if there is a fight in town.  The self-parking may fill up and can be hard to find parking.  At times, even valet parking will become full and only Diamond or Seven Star cardholders may use the Valet.. My recommendations for dining also includes the Gordon Ramsay Pub.  I have a separate review for their restaurants.
Tremendous hotel with a lot to offer. The Forum shops are unbelievable! The casino is just too busy and loud. It's a confusing place. Beautiful pool!
