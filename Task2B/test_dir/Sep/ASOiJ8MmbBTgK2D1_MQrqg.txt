Taking into account the service, quality of food, price, and the unparalleled views, I highly recommending coming to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant for a special dinner date. . . I brought my bf here for his bday weekend and our first meal off the plane at 10pm was at The Eiffel Tower restaurant. While everybody raves about their views, I think they are seriously underrated for their food. Every single dish that we ordered was amazing. Our waiter was ridiculously attentive without being in your face. The entire restaurant gets gorgeous fountain views at the perfect height. If you make a reservation for 2, they tend to seat you at the window at these cute couple tables where you both sit face next to each other and enjoy the strip view. . . We ordered about 6/7 dishes, including a lobster corn chowder with crab flan (huge chunks of juicy lobster scattered throughout a creamy corn chowder, embellished with a chunk of crab flan), foie gras and warm pear appetizer, the beef wellington (huge portions and unlike anything I've had before, good flavor), an amazing veal entree, and 1 dessert + 1 complimentary dessert for his birthday. Everything was stellar... I didn't have EXTREMELY high expectations so me and my taste buds were ever so thrilled all night. Best part was, our two-person birthday dinner with drinks came to $270 total including tax and a generous tip. Very reasonable in my opinion... Keep in mind we ordered enough food for 3-4 normal people. :) . . A special night! . . It would be really hard for one to have a bad night here. Even if it's just for a drink or dessert, or a snack, it's worth the experience.
Gorgeous view of the Bellagio, the surrounding desert mountains and the strip.  Time your reservation to catch the Bellagio fountain show and ask for a table by the window!  The night time view is beautiful as well.  We visited for a late lunch and had a lovely table by the window.  Our service was excellent.  The menue is over priced in the way most strip restaurants are, but worth the experience.  Variety of choices on the menu to try.  Wines by the glass if you like.  Wonderful lunch experience. Will definitely be back!
We're from New Orleans and came for the views. Our next visit was for the cuisine and service. Classic French cuisine, with a wine list to match. Try the blue cheese (appetizer) and pistachio (dessert) souffles, you won't be disappointed.  Some restaurants are good for a special occasion, this one makes each meal a special occasion. We will return. Thanks Sharon and Isobel. LEK
Fabulous meal !! I had the best beef Wellington! Escargot was amazing! The bread was great! Impeccable service with a wonderful view of the strip!
The whole package is a four.  The views, service and ambience is a 5 and the food is a 3.  We had a magical view overlooking the Bellagio fountains with the pretty--if Disneyesque--architecture of the Italian style buildings around the Bellagio lake.  In fact, even the restaurant itself felt like a Disneyworld restaurant.. . I'm not sure this would be my restaurant of choice (given the expense) if I were taking my wife.  I would take her to an equally expensive but more gastronomic choice in Vegas.  But, given that I had my 13 year old daughter, the choice couldn't have been better.. . The food is pretty good but you can tell this isn't a chef of supreme talent.  My daughter's halibut was excellent.  My veal was a little tough and a tad over-cooked.  In other words, the food is perfectly fine but don't expect Eric Ripert from Le Bernardin or Thomas Keller from the French Laundry.  I wouldn't even put the food in a category of Mortons or Ruth Chris.  It's a half a step below these.  But, the view, the fun of riding the elevator and the overall experience made this a wonderful evening with my daughter who has raved about the restaurant.. . Here's what to expect for price (assuming appetizer, main and dessert) per person:. . $75 food. $50 wine. $10 tax. $25 tip. . $150/per person
We all went here to eat on our trip to Las Vegas. We decided to try this place, because we heard good things. I am going to start by saying that the food is amazing. Amazing is an understatement. I got a salad, but everyone's food was pretty delicious. The service was good. They had 3 waiters for our table so we had excellent service. The reason why I gave the restaurant a 3 star was because, they kept  bringing us mineral water, which we did not order and charged us for it. We spent almost $50 dollars for water we did not even order. If you are eating here, expect to spend some money!!! And, the wait time to get the food is also very long.
Wonderful ambiance, fantastic service and delicious food. We were a group of 30 and everyone was very happy and left very satisfied.
I recently ate  here for a business trip.  It was a price fixed meal and I must admit it was pretty tasty.  There were 23 of us, but the service was excellent.  The view was awesome and we never had empty glasses, maybe that was because they charged for the wine and water so empty means no money.. . While the food was good, it was not close to perfect.  The lobster appetizer that I had was a bit chewy, seemed a tad undercooked.  The salad was very good and the rack of lamb was excellent.  My only take with the main course was that there was not any starch with it.  A nice mashed potato or something would have made it much better.  I had the rack of lamb and it came with a slice of tomato and egg plant.  While it was good, it just seemed to be missing something.  The Creme Brulee was very good!. . I liked this place, but will probably never return, just due to the fact that there are so many other places I have yet to try, but if you have never visited I suggest you stop in.
Excellent panoramic view with Bellagio fountains in front of you, service is excellent and food is delicious a joy to my taste buds, price is accordant to what is  been offer , will look forward to return to the restaurant when we are back in Vegas!!!!
Thank you Ridge and Lloyd you guys are awesome. I had made reservations for dinner initially and unfortunately were not able to make it for dinner and when I called in they said to come in for dessert and drinks would be just fine. Well we got to the restaurant and a very rude and passive lady tall with blonde hair helped us and was refusing to give us a seat that we wanted claiming that it was taken by reserved dinner guest which was an absolute lie. Right than we were about had it with her nonsense and were heading out when Ridge one of the waiters stopped us and apologized for the misunderstanding and that we were able to sit there afterwards. Just after that Lloyd the manager approached us heard our complaint and was very apologetic for it and assured he would take care of the situation. I would definitely come back again for dinner I'll make my reservations with Ridge next time and make sure to completely avoid that girl as should all f you. Thanks for the dessert Lloyd you guys made my wife's  birthday absolutely wonderful
The spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains is the real selling point here ... honestly, I found the food good but not great and pretty overpriced.  Service, however, is excellent, and the general atmosphere is of a "special" event.. . I've been here before for Sunday brunch ... and if you time that right, you can see the fountains when they're running during the day on the weekends.  I really enjoyed that meal (about a year ago, I guess) and the prices weren't too outrageous.  They don't offer the souffle for dessert during the day, however, and since I REALLY wanted to try it based on the many rave reviews, we decided to come for dinner.. . When booking, I saw that if you book a 5:00 or 5:15 table, you are guaranteed a window table overlooking the fountains.  We had a show to get to anyway, so that sounded good to me.  However, our window table was off to one side, so the view of the fountains wasn't that great ... and one of us was pretty much pointed away from them entirely with no view at all to speak of.. . Appetizers -- corn chowder with lobster custard ($18) was way too sweet.  Had to add lots of salt to make it palatable.  Far better was the Roquefort souffle ($16), a small dome of light and fluffy blue cheese and eggs paired with a small green salad.  . . Entrees -- crispy-skinned arctic char with smoked beets ($46) was on the small side, but the fish filets were moist and tasty ... the plate also featured a foam emulsion that was surprisingly bland considering it was made with horseradish.  The beef wellington ($68 -- ouch) was a filet atop a layer of mushrooms and pate, all individually wrapped up in puff pastry.  A small pitcher of rich red wine reduction came alongside, as well as a pile of limp snow peas that looked like they'd been scooped out of a buffet chafing dish and plopped on the plate.  The meat was a shade overcooked, but still very tasty, especially with that sauce.  However, I could easily reproduce this meal at home for $10 with no advanced chef skills required. I find that annoying.  I don't mind paying high prices when magic is being done in the kitchen, magic I could never work myself.  This was not one of those meals.. . And so, time for the souffle (not sure of the price ... $18?).  We chose pistachio to share, and it was okay, but not over-the-moon fantastic.  It tasted very strongly of amaretto instead of pistachio.  If I had it to do over again, I'd go with the chocolate instead.. . End of the night, with drinks, tax, and tip, we spent about $235.  Meh.  I wouldn't do it again.. . I MIGHT, however, return for daytime brunch.
My husband and I dined here for our anniversary. It was amazing! The food, the view, and the service were outstanding! We even got a free appetizer and dessert since it was a special occasion. I had the short ribs and my husband had the beef wellington, both melted in your mouth. Definitely expensive, but worth it!
