OK so I have a secret obsession with German food I won't lie.  Being from the Midwest if it's heavy, gravy covered or fried and totally bad for you I'll take two!!  Their Jaggersnitzel is to die for!  I also tried sides of their spatzle and potato salad.  Spatzle is always never as good as I hope it sounds it will be but, it was ok and their potato salad was really good.  I love a good potato salad and those Germans know how to make it!  My boyfriend got a sausage plate and he did enjoy it although he's not a fatty food fan!  I also got a small Das Boot!!  It was small and plastic and I really wanted the larger glass one but, those were over 70$ and too much beer for me!  But, my small Das Boot was all I needed and it was filled with the most delicious Hefeweizen I have ever put my lips on!! Holy Cow I dream about that beer to this day!! When I'm in Vegas it's a guarantee I will be headed back here!!  The atmosphere is awesome, large vaulted ceilings and picnic table style seating.  It is an exact replica of the one in Munich Germany.  So cool felt like a travel without leaving Las Vegas!!
I'd first heard of the Hofbrauhaus on the Food Network a few years ago. It was highly recommended for it's authentic food and dining atmosphere from what I remember.. . I love, love, love German food, and hadn't had any in several months, plus after skipping lunch in favor of a few pitchers of poolside drinks, my husband and I were really in the mood for some salty, carb-y food...and what could be better than spaetzle!. . I was aware of the live entertainment and therefore brought earplugs. I'm glad I did! As we walked in the dining room, there was a lady standing on the bench of her community table, clapping to the Dire Straights cover band. Also, if spankings by dirndl-wearing waitresses is on your bucket list (for some reason) you can get, or watch that done here.. . Overall, the food was decent, definitely got the carbs we came for but I've been spoiled by Uwe's in Colorado Springs. Hofbrauhaus doesn't live up, but in all fairness that's a very high bar!. . If you're not into the kinda touristy place that has an attached gift shop, I'd skip it.
Meh.  It's decent food, but nothing to write home about.  . . I had a plate of sausages with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut, my wife had jagetschnitzle, and she definitely chose better than I did, but neither of us were all that impressed.  The servers were nice, but not all that quick to refill water (I realize this is not the sort of place one normally orders water, but I was already all liquored up and looking for something hearty to help soak up my liquid lunch). . . If I were, for some reason, to go back here I'd probably order my food from the bar next to the gift shop.  That way I could avoid the obnoxiously loud cafeteria-esque dining room and the utterly terrible live music.  And even if the food wasn't extraordinary it was at least decent and decently priced.  This might be a fun place to go with a big group, but not really what I was looking for.
Nach drei Wochen US Bier knallt das Original HB Bier mit 5,2 % richtig rein... Herrlich !!! Das Ambiente ist typisch Vegas kunstlich, aber nicht unangenehm kitschig. Das Essen (Schweinsbraten fur 16$ und Jagerschnitzel fur 18$) war erstaunlich lecker, bei beiden Gerichten bisslwenig Sauce. Eine Halbe Helles kostet 8$, im. Vergleich kostet im Venetian ein 0,33 Bier 7$. Also noch im Rahmen. Da wir in der Woche dort waren lief es ohne Halli Galli ab, am WE oder abends ist sicher mehr los. . . Fur Bayern, Bierliebhaber oder Freunde der dt. Kuche lohnt sich ein Besuch!. . O zapft is ;-)
Don't go to Hofbrauhaus for their "authentic" German cuisine. Go there for the ambiance, the kinky paddling, and the beer. . . The food is definitely mediocre, but nothing the singalongs and the drunken chants would not make up for (if that's your thing). Go here with a big group and definitely make reservations because it tends to become a mad house otherwise. Not a great place for couples or people who don't enjoy drinking.
Something different to try! It's fun, super loud, very friendly & a taste of Europe! Being from Poland I love every place that gives me memories of home & my moms & grandmothers cooking! . The food is meant to be shared & very homy. There's a lot of great things on the menu with delicious HUGE schnitzels & sausages! The beer is HUGE as well & the goal is to just have a good time. You sing, dance, get spanked, stand on your benches, whatever you want to do...all in fun.. This is another great option for groups.
Yes, it's incredibly loud. And yes, the entertainment can be hokey. And yes, it's overpriced. But everyone should experience The Hofbrauhaus at least once! The menu is everything German( red cabbage, German potato salad, spatzle, and, of course, beer), but the standouts are the sausages, the HUGE wienerschnitzel, and the Bavarian pretzels with a delicious sweet mustard. For dessert, there's apple strudel and Black Forest cake. Go with friends, but don't expect to carry on a conversation! Just enjoy the ambiance!
Most expensive place in vegas. Could of gone to a 5 star buffet with 5 friends for half the price.
If you're a tourist....you'll probably love this place because you're too drunk or high to notice what it's issues are
Hofbrau always does their best to make sure you have a good time rather it's in Panama City Beach or Las Vegas. Good food, good beer.
If you love Germany food and beer this is a must try!  The Snitzel is amazing!  The sausage sampler at $29 bucks is a bit on the expensive side but a must!   But the beer is why I come back every time I'm in Vegas!   The  Hef is the best I've had!   Inauthentic German experience right down to the liederhosen!   Love love love this place!   hoy hoy hoy!
Atmosphere- We were here on a Monday evening and it was pretty quiet.  I would like to try on a weekend to get the full effect.  Only one other couple was seated at our table, so we had plenty of room to set our large beers and plates of food.  The band was playing, however they only played two German songs- I was kind of disappointed.  Still, there were larger groups there and they were getting pretty rowdy, it was fun interacting with them! . . Service- Our server was fine, certainly not extraordinary.  I was expecting a little more enthusiasm, this is a beer hall after all!  We did have a coupon for a small free beer with purchase of an entree and we were able to redeem without any issues.  . . Food-  The food was average.  Large portions, so expect leftovers or share plates.  They definitely missed the mark on the pretzel, did not taste fresh and it wasn't served warm.  The beer was excellent.  . . Recommendations- Probably would be best to go on a busy weekend night and with a large group.
The atmosphere is great. The live band, the standing on your seat and raising your beer, the paddling and shots Our party was only of 3 so we were seated with another party of 3, there was plenty more room at our table and it was fun interacting with everyone. We went on a Saturday night and reaped all this place had to offer. Fun fun fun! . . The food is fine. I loved the pretzel and the potato and cucumber salad. The mustard served with the pretzel was great. The food came out quickly especially given how many people were seated in this place.
$$BEER$$...Just so so. I guess the price of beer made it expensive. Nothing to write home about.
Jaegermeister, tonight was flavorful!thankfully the mushroom gravy not overly salty perfect with mushrooms abundant enough to not have to hunt for! . The Oktoberfest beer was yummy enough for a second!  . . The band was different on this visit. Change is good! It's reasonable that locals might tire of the same ol same ol or maybe all of my visits happened to have been on nights the old band was booked. . . Blood sausage caught my dining partners attention. By the time I glanced at his plate to ask for a bite.... It was gone!  As it was a first for him I asked before it was served what his plan was if he didn't find it to his liking!  His response ... "Eat it !"  His take on it? It's "ok". I don't think he's a fan! . . Fun way to spend a late afternoon! I've felt for a very long time that Hofbrau Haus is a gem among many in Vegas. For us tho it's a taste of one of our homes... It's sister location in Newport KY was home to many of our family celebrations.
