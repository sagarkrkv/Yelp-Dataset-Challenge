I can't believe they closed this place down!!!! I came to Max Brenner a while ago. Me & my date had the chocolate sampler And milk chocolate fondue, w/ strawberries bananas and marshmallows may I add :);)) it was amazing!! They had many different chocolate varieties to choose from. Hands down the best dessert place, specially if u are a chocolate lover..Loved it, sucks to see it closed down.
This is very disappointing to hear.. It's my boyfriends birthday and I wanted to bring him here. When looking for the menu items I find out the restaurant has been closed for sometime.. I hope it was only closed for remodeling... This used to be my go to restaurant while shopping.!
