I can't begin to tell you all the problems we had with this restaurant again won't be back, would not recommend this one. Mario Battali needs to actually visit his restaurants and train his staff on waiting tables and cooking steaks.
I didn't have reservations, so I scoured the Palazzo's site for a dinner house, and stumbled on CarneVino. It's Mario Batali's place, aside from B & B, so I figured hurray! Maybe it will be like Pizzeria Mozza. NOPE. It was more like Osteria Mozza, but meatier, and sticker shock. Now, we're staying at the Palazzo and had Joel Robuchon reservations, so prize isn't an issue. When you're expecting it. I'll pay $10 for ice cream when I know it's $10 ice cream. . . Mr. V was also not in a terrific mood - mostly due to not being able to hear the waiter well with his heavy accent and low voice, so when he didn't understand the way that the per person for two prices were laid out, his cage was rattled - so the meal wasn't as pleasant as I had wished. . . I ordered a house glass of white wine because CarneVino is a place where bottles are ordered, and Mr. V doesn't drink wine. I ordered the prosciutto with melon slices, which was absolutely wonderful. The prosciutto was so delicately sliced and just the right amount of salty. The melon slices were soft and juicy, not overly sweet/ripe, and made a nice after bite when I was done with the prosciutto. I didn't role them much, just enjoyed the pink slices with my fingers and glass of wine.. . Now, having been to Batali's two Mozzas in LA, I've had his egg ravioli, his ragus, his octopus, his cheeses, and I'm not going to eat a porterhouse steak by myself. All their steak offerings were just too large for me. So I went with his seafood stew, which was very similar to cioppino. If anything, that's whatit was without being called that. It was spicier than I'd anticipated, so it actually upset my stomach. That's not the stew's fault, but my own for not eating much throughout the day that wasn't done through a straw. The head-on shrimp (two in two days!) was the best part of it though. No matter the upsetness of my belly, I was not letting that guy leave my table uneaten. It was good overall, but would've liked less spicy. Or been told it would be spicy. . . Mr. V ordered the 20oz pork loin, bone-in. Now, pork is strange in the way that you want it fully cooked, but not...well done, so to speak. So there's a delicate balance between juicy and tough with the white meats. Mr. V immediately said "chef's preference", but the waiter hung back and said that maybe it was a little pink. Pink on pork is not really that appetizing, so Mr. V said medium, and the waiter bowed his head and left. Well, bad idea. Because the pork was tough - and this was AFTER Mr. V had given his okay to however it should be cooked! I was actually astonished, and almost wanted to send it back FOR him. But the charred edges with caramelized butter were so, so good. He ate the entire thing, so it wasn't so bad. But definitely not what I would've expected, especially AFTER the waiter had advised against Mr. V's wishes. . . The restaurant was okay - and as usual, I'd like to give places more than one chance because every place/couple have a bad night. Mr. V was not happy though, and I can definitely understand why.
The best lunch that we had in Vegas. A quiet, tasteful, welcome respite from the clutter and noise of the casino. The arugula salad was excellent, especially with the featured goat cheese, and the calamari was the best I've had. Would definitely return for dinner.
I have eaten at Carnevino 4 times now, and each time has been a unique experience. One time I even ate here for lunch. The house ribeye for 2 cut table side is a must. They specialize in Dry Aged Beef, which is an art. There are relatively few places left where they dry age the beef in-house. If you haven't tried such a thing, you must go here.. . The pasta dishes and salads are also surprisingly good. I feel like there is something for everyone here. Even a vegetarian has more choices than just the veggie sides or a basic salad.
I hated everything about my meal. We were a group of 10 and each person had a complaint. We addressed out complaints to the manager who didn't seem to care. Needless to say I would never go back. It was overpriced and the portions were like for a tasting menu.
If you want a break from the hustle and bustle of Vegas, carnevino offers up top shelf servings of steak and a great selection of meats. You don't have to go for their famed steak, I have had the scaloppine and the cotoletta the last couple of visits and they were sensational. . . Wine list is vast but extremely top heavy in Vegas fashion. I still have the menu from two years ago which had some better picks in the $80-120 price point that is the sweet spot.
We were in Vegas for the weekend of our 10th anniversary.  We went to Carnevino on our last night, Sept. 7.  The attention from the staff was phenomenal and the food was to die for.. . We were seated in near the wall, right underneath a speaker, which was very loud.  When we asked the hostess if they could turn the music down, she immediately brought over the manager who apologized for the music but explained that the volume couldn't be lowered but that he would gladly move us to another room.  The next room, the wine room, was much smaller, quieter and more intimate.  The wait staff was extremely knowledgeable about all the dishes and could explain everything without having to refer to the menu.  . . We started out with a shared pasta plate of Garganelli Bolognese.  The pasta is similar to a penne, and the Bolognese sauce was divine.  I'm Italian and grew up eating all kinds of pasta with homemade "gravy" and this was the 2nd best dish of pasta I had ever had in my entire life.  The best was a few years ago in a hole in the wall place in Venice.  If this wasn't a steak restaurant, I would have had an entire dish of that pasta.. . We ordered the rib eye for 2, cooked medium rare, with a side of Mascarpone & Guanciale Mashed Potatoes.  The steak, dry-aged in house for 90 days, was cooked perfectly and they sliced it tableside off the bone.  Before serving, they sprinkled some sea salt and drizzled each dish with a limited edition virgin olive oil.  I wish we weren't 3,000 miles away because my dog would have LOVED to have that bone.  It was at least a foot long.  The potatoes came with a poached egg on top (I missed that part of the description or I probably wouldn't have ordered them) and the server broke the egg and mixed it in.  I was horrified, but it was fantastic!  The egg and the mascarpone gave the potatoes a heavenly richness that I've never tasted before.  Guanciale is a pork jowl bacon and it really brought the potatoes to a higher level.   . . This is a high-end steakhouse, but WELL worth the price.  I wish there were one here in NYC.
We had a fantastic dinning experience last night.  It was amazing.  The service was spot on and the steak we ordered was one of the best i have ever had!  I don't type that lightly either.  Trust me, get the bone in rib eye for two cooked medium.  You'll feel like Fred Flinstone lol  Yes, it's a little pricy but for 90 day aged steak what would you expect?  Go to IHOP if you want a cost effective steak.  You get what you pay for in life....   Their wine list is one of the most extensive I've seen in Vegas, though not a drinker my friends from LA were in town and said they were very, very impressed.  Oh yeah, be sure to get the cream corn, though not as sweet as STK or SW's it is the actual kernal shucked in house!  Play really cool music too....
We keep coming back to this place every time we are in Vegas. From the drinks to the dessert , perfection. The bone in ribeye is the best steak we have ever had ! The wine list is extensive . We had the grilled octopus appetizer and it was so tender. We chose sides of roasted beets which were juicy and the decadent mashed potatoes. Every bite of the ribeye was heaven on earth. The homemade gelato - I had pumpkin spice - was the perfect ending to this dining experience. The service is second to none, friendly without being stuffy. I love it when I learn things about food from the staff and they are well versed in all aspects of the choices on the menu. Worth every penny spent there !
The young gals at the hostess desk had me worried we chose wrong.  However, our waiter, Jared, quickly changed my opinion.  He was helpful, polite and prompt. Another nice gentleman brought out a sample appetizer "compliments of the chef". The wine list is impressive though I was in a beer mood. Carnevino didn't disappoint. I had an Italian beer that Jared recommended. Then a Estrella Inedit, so smooth and good (Jared recommended). I had the filet. It was great. I'm a freak who likes her filet well done so the center was too rare for me but the outside was delicious.  The only bad thing were the hostesses.
This was my first time at Carnevino and I loved it! We came for a nice dinner before a show with another couple, and all enjoyed the experience. I recommend their ribeye (this is what my fiance and his friend shared), the mushrooms (oh gosh, the BEST I've ever had), mashed potatoes and spinach. The sides were surprisingly delicious! I had the NY strip and it was good but honestly I wasn't blow away...upon reflection I should have ordered the filet. I was really thankful that the waiter steered us towards ordering our meat a bit more well-done than we usually do (medium instead of medium rare) because they do tend to cook more rare. The best part about Carnevino was the service though. I have been to other Vegas restaurants, but they have some of the best servers here! Everyone was helpful, courteous and NOT pretentious. The waiter was honest with us and didn't let us down. I would definitely go back!
Came here for my dads 70th birthday. Food was pretty dang good. I had the New York strip steak. It was cooked well. Also had the mashed potatoes. Those are a must. They open a fresh egg into it table side and it just adds an element of richness to the flavor. Only reason not 5 stars is because the service wasn't great. I don't mind paying the prices here, but service should then be impeccable. Especially with all the great places to eat in vegas. Would I go back?  Sure. Are there other places I want to try before going back?  Absolutely.

In a town where "Whales," "Ballers," and "High Rollers" command comps at many Top-Tables it should come as no surprise that the opportunity to indulge on exotic ingredients is available to those willing to pay, yet when it comes to Sin City's very best beef the question becomes even more complicated - an answer involving not just cash, but time.  Known by the term 'Riserva' and nowhere present on the restaurant menu our eight-top's 240+ day dry-aged steak experience actually began years prior with selective sourcing, breeding, feeding, butchery, as well as storage - an aged bacteria direct from Italy driving the latter - and with each stage described at length throughout the course of a 3.5 hour meal that entailed no less than twenty other outstanding plates plus far too many drinks it can only be said that nothing could have prepared us for the meal's apex, four different steaks plus a chop offering an education in things few will ever have the opportunity to taste.  Having already visited Carnevino twice, with wowed results each time, it seems almost a crime to gloss over items like a textbook bellini thick with white peach or tartare so tender it simply dissolved on the tongue but with all apologies to tender pastas including the famous beef cheek ravioli as well as the "super chicken" egg raviolo suffice it to say that only a single side of mushrooms was less than exemplary...but not a one of them could match the meats, the younger steaks and chop easily on par with those from last year while the Riserva was almost unimaginably tender with a flavor profile that ranged from walnuts to stilton to truffles as a buttery basenote lingered in each bite.   Undoubtedly a big budget event in a space not unaccustomed to such things it was finally with a table of desserts followed by a small plate of cookies that the evening would end and visited by head chef Nicole Brisson before our departure each of us said our thanks - an invite to tour the aging facility something I look forward to doing soon and a return visit already in the planning stages for when my friends are next in town.. . Considered by some, including myself, to be the best steakhouse in the country even before this meal suffice it to say that Carnevino upped the stakes (and steaks) for all future meals here in Las Vegas - the private room, the exquisite services, the specially requested soundtrack of Pearl Jam's Ten played throughout the restaurant, more than a handful of 'gifts' joining each course, and especially the Riserva all making a special meal truly world class.
Everything from the time we walked in to the time we left 5 star service and food rating. We got the beef cheek ravioli which isn't on menu but recommend, excellent!!! Table service was exceptional, decor was so beautiful, such a warm welcoming feeling.
When old men try and be hip it's just sad. I do not expect or like rock music for 16 year olds played for my fine dining. They would do well to focus on the food instead of the 'tude. My foie was way too salty. My steak was tough and not tender at all. Worst fillet in memory. If these guys reduced their prices in half I would accept more rock, but not with my $100 dinner. Would not go back.
Overpriced good food!!  The price of the food did not quite justify the overall quality and certainly not the quantity.  The staff was A+ and excellent service.  Also, theywere very knowledgable about the overall menu items and set our expectations very well.  If you want to impress someone, well, maybe a good place.  However, if you are looking for value, I suggest other premium steakhouses.  Call me unreasonable, but I would prefer Ruth's Chris over this restaurant.
Great dining experience.  Scallops and Octopus for apetizers.  These dishes are flawless, exactly what we expected from a Mario Batali steakhouse.. . We skipped the salads and pastas, straight to the steaks.  We got the New York, the Ribeye for 2, and the veal chop, and had them cut up table side and served family style.  The ribeye was hands down the king of the meal.  I even cleaned the bone, picked it up on this $125 a person joint and gnawed on it like a caveman.  It was the best meat on the plate.  For 4 people we couldn't even finish the veal chop which was bland and dry compared to the steaks.. . The sides of mashed potatos, and broccoli were fine, mushrooms were eh, could have skipped 'em and the corn was really good.
