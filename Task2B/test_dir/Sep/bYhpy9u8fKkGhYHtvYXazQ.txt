Although we didn't stay here, we spent some time here in the casino and just sight seeing. The staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. The casino is nice with plenty of machines to keep you busy.
There are things I really like about this hotel such as the location on the strip, the buffet--which is one of the best in Vegas, going to the top of the Eiffel Tower and watching the fountain show at the Bellagio across the street and Volcano Show at Mirage up the strip. You can get very nice photos of the strip from up top. The rooms were large and clean. . . Some things I didn't like...no microwave in the room, hot water took forever to get going in the shower, and the $15 wifi fee. They had a couple of bars down in the casion area, one in particular where the live bands play, had a rude douchebag of a bartender. If you're playing the slots drinks are slow to get to you, even on nights that aren't so busy. I'm a good tipper too, so I'm not sure what the issue was. . . Like all casinos they have a rewards program. I gambled over $1,000 in two days (obviously not a high roller) and the points I earned on my card were just enough to buy me two bottled waters in the lobby on the way out. Not sure if that is status quo for Vegas, but I thought I would have earned more than $7 in points. . . I'll likely try another hotel my next visit to Vegas. This was my second time at Paris and while I wasn't disappointed, I wasn't swept off my feet either.
I give this place 5 stars- not for the rooms but for the staff who were amazing- I left a bag with a laptop in it & staff/security - got home to southern cal before I realized it- The security staff- lost and found - hotel front desk- went above and beyond to locate it for me - thank you paris staff for exceptional service during a difficult day- great location- loved pool & DJ - fun for couples
My stay at the Paris Hotel was surprisingly pleasant.. . 1 star for the location - proximity was close to everything/everywhere that my friends and I wanted to go. . . 1 star for the cleanliness - although the room itself was a bit out dated, the size of the room was more than enough for 4 people.. . 1 star for the restaurants/shops inside of the hotel - extremely convenient for breakfast/coffee.. . Lastly, 1 star for the pool! If you don't want to spend money going to a day club, I would say that the pool here has a great ambiance/music.. . Checking-In was easy, and checking-out was a breeze. The view from our room was spectacular! Not only were we able to see the Eiffel tower, but also the water show in front of the Bellagio Hotel. I would recommend this place!
I've always wanted to stay here. I saw a deal online and booked right away! Paris is awesome bc it's never boring - it's got a bunch of eateries and shops along the walkways between it and Bally's. It's centrally located on the strip as well so it's always bustling inside and out!. . The rooms are nice and obviously get nicer as you upgrade. Ours was sufficient for sleeping in because we didn't have much downtime. WiFi was available for free for the first two devices so long as you pay the resort fee...and it also sucked. Oh well. Their pool was pretty nice - it gets crowded but not daytime-pool-party crowded.. . Their staff was great. My husband lost his iPhone the first night of our Vegas weekend. What are the odds that we'd find it? Well, after retracing our steps and checking other casinos, Paris's security office had it! Thank goodness someone was kind enough to return it!. . Their buffet is excellent - bottomless mimosas! And Mon Ami Gabi was one of my favorite places to eat.. . Definitely a great place to stay for a mid-range-priced/good quality Vegas trip!
My husband an myself were at the Paris Hotel last night to see Jersey Boys, the show was awesome and we both felt we were seeing Frankie Valli and the 4 seasons in person it was just that good. After the show we went to  the new Chinese restaurant it was the first night open, very busy but the food was great..be sure to check these 2 places out and have a great time we sure did
Beautiful design, Paris like style, needs a bit of maintenance like beds scratch and no way is right to charge 25 dollars for 45 minutes As. in a elliptical machine , besides that hotel is beautiful , service is great , food delicious.
Best stay in Vegas since coming here and conceiving my first child 15 years ago.. Buffet at Le Village was impeccable...never knew of a sweet polenta. Rooms were well appointed, but whose here for a well appointed room?!? I'm here for the Zumba at the Tropicana. A fun weekend indeed. Made better by a private tour with a local. Will definitely come back, this time with my two boys for the Dream Experience and tool around the Las Vegas Speedway in a Ferrari & Lambos. . Cheers!! . ps/NB/check-this:. Signed up for Travel Rewards while waiting in the check-in line for Paris. Got a discount on the room. Came to about $300.00 for the weekend + Travel Reward perks. Rooms change rates hourly if not sooner. It pays to check the website frequently prior to checking in. They always told me doing your homework would pay off!!!Ennnnn- joy!!
Wedding Package DO NOT DO IT!. The entire package sounded great online. We went in months in advance met our wedding coordinator all was good...so we thought. We paid in full and communicated with our coordinator via email to plan the details. It was like pulling teeth to have her respond to our questions. The Ceremony it's self was great the Pastor assigned was awesome. The penthouse was nice, but the A/C did not work during our reception! We didn't get to ride the Eiffel  tower ride due to maintenance. We didn't get the free limo ride as promised. And the worst of the worst was the picture package...what a rip off. You only get  20 5x8 pictures out of the 400+ they took. If you want all the pictures that's an additional $850. The photographer captured loading docks in most of our pictures. When the lady showed us our picture she literally rushed us out as my Wife was crying. She said we only have 5 minutes left because her next appointment was soon. This entire process was so cookie cutter and not worth the money. I'm happy my wife and I are married, but given what we went through what nightmare. Ballys/Paris do not get married here.
Stayed at the Paris for fournights with my Girlfriend. All days have been werkdays, so we got a REALLY great deal which was worth the money.. . The waiting time was okay. I would have been happy to directly get my room card, but i guess that's just a must at the Paris. At least they had several counters opened.. . After politely asking for it, we even got ourselfs a little "upgrade": A room on the 21st. floor with a great view of the pool, the eiffel tower and the strip, including the Bellaggio Fountains, that looked incredible from up there. In general the view was amazing, day and night.. The room was the cheapest they offered, called "luxury"and i really can't complain: Everything was tidy, clean, smelled good. The style is kind of "old french", but completely what i expected and what suits the style of a paris-themed hotel. The Bathroom had a walk in shower and a bathtub, which was a bit too small to take a relaxing bath.. . We didn't really try the food, except from that little bakery. One morning we had coffee and muffins and it was good and the price was vegas/hotel like, but still ok.. A beer at the bar was about 6$ i think, which is pretty standard for a vegas hotel at the strip. Waiters were friendly and competent.. . The style of the interieur of the hotel is pretty cool. It has a sky with clouds painted on the ceiling, street lights and old french houses that host the shops and restaurants.. the casino follows up that style and is nice too.. The only thing to criticize about the casino is the staff. While the waitresses are cool and offer you free drinks while playing, the roulette dealers (we tried our luck on 2 different roulette tables) were pretty annoying. Because we're not millionaires, we always bought chips for the minimum price of about 20$. Also, it was our first time playing roulette at a casino. Instead of being friendly or even explayning some of the special rules to us, the staff looked boring, checked their watches every few minutes and was not in the mood for talking or even smiling. That kind of ruined the gambling for us.. But the hotel itself is great!
I've been staying for 6 days so far, and am seriously not impressed. I have never felt more ripped off at every turn. $20 early check-in fee, additional charges for room-service, charges based on how many people are eating the room service; as if 12 for an iceberg salad isn't high enough. Casino restaurants are really really not very good, and about ~$30/person/meal. $15/day for 2 devices to use the internet, PER DAY. Most of the TV channels are hotel closed circuit or in foreign languages. The maid service is not very thorough. If you really want to do the whole Vegas Strip experience thing, go to Cesar's Palace, or Winn, or Luxor, at least those places are nice inside.
Stayed here twice within the past 6months and Enjoyed the stay both times. Helpful Staff and Great Location.
Lord have mercy, if I wasn't put here by our client, I would never have chosen this hotel. . First, thevalet guy (no, not valet guyS. Just one dude. Solo style.) simply cannot handle the amount of traffic that comes through in the morning. And the three poor schmucks that are there in the evening have a serious case of "I really don't give a sh*t". Which is fair. I can't say I would either. But don't get poopy when I give you $1 after having to wait 15 minutes for you to take this damn rental off my hands. I need to go to sleep immediately, and you're holding me up.. Second, why must there be such dark lighting in the bathroom? I'm not trying to have a romantic evening by candlelight in there - I'm trying to shower (um, where shall I hang the washcloth guys? On the piss-poor design rack? Oh, there isn't one.) and get ready for work and NOT risk walking out looking like a lady of the night. . Third, your restaurant selection bums me and my food allergy riddled self out like, WHOA. . Finally, I have the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door all the time, because I'm staying there for a while, and I don't want you to deal with the clothes I've thrown all over the place like I'm 13. So, that being said, please please do not call and leave a message on the phone each day to alert me of this. I know it's your policy, but it's also my policy to get super stressed out when I see the message light flashing violently at me the moment I walk in the door. . . I mean, Christ, I thought my nana had died or something, only to hear the deadpan voice of someone so clearly over it telling me they 'tried to clean but couldn't, so to call if I changed my mind' followed by an equally bland 'merr-cee'. . (That last bit made me laugh though, so I'll give you that. French isn't for everyone.). . On a positive note, the second star was given for your lightening fast elevators. Those rock.
My husband and I decided in April to get married in Vegas. I found a great package flight/hotel Paris was the hotel of choice. I decided on it because they have a separate bathtub and shower. Maybe not a deal breaker for most, but for us we wanted a bath not just a shower.. . When they say the check-in time is 4 pm--they mean it--unless you want to pay for something immediate. We did not. Neither of us have ever arrived anywhere early and had to wait until we went to Paris. Good thing we needed a marriage license...so we did that prior to check-in.. . At all times the valets were excellent and very helpful. Hats off to you guys! We found out that since Paris is a Caesar's resort, we could use a shuttle between hotels. That saved a TON on cab fares--YAY. . . The room was nice. The bed VERY comfy. The dumpster view was not what I would call stellar but hey we were in Vegas and not planning on being in the room other than to sleep. I did try to use the TV ONCE and from what I could tell to see anything I needed to pay to do so. Downer. I played Candy Crush instead.. . There are ample restaurants. We grabbed some pizza one day and I had a latte at their coffee stand. Both decent. We had drinks at a bar and yes they were pricey--7.75 for a Miller Lite but hey we were prepared so no big thing. We did find a super cheap place across the street--cheap beer and shots. Yahoo! . . The $5 mimosas and bloody marys were SMALL but they were only $5 so we had a few of those along the way. . . Paris connects to Ballys and we found a super breakfast buffet there. Very yummy and a lot of choices. I think it was $10 each and they had the $5 drink thing too. So yay for that! . . I will give you a warning that while you are sauntering between Paris and Ballys there is a little stand and folks accost you under the guise of a "free show." These folks are from Wyndham resorts. I can go on and on about that little deal. RUN should they come near you. Do not ask and do not engage. Put on your "I am ignoring the homeless on Main Street in Houston" and just keep walking. Hey I live in downtown Houston--and trust me there are so many "stories" I have heard over the years...I do not engage. My charity goes to shelter animals. Again another story. Main point is RUN FROM WYNDHAM.. . Back to the Paris. The price was good and we felt worth it for the accommodations. I was hoping for at least a free drink since I rocked my wedding dress all over the casino--alas not so much. Would I go there again? You bet. The decor of the lobby/casino is hands down the most beautiful. I felt like I was walking the Paris streets which was super cool.. . Now at check out (mind you we paid for our trip WAY in advance) we were hit with "resort fees" to the tune of $22 a day. Apparently this is a total Vegas thing. I do not have an issue paying per se....what gets me is this is NOT UP FRONT. If you are going to charge this, then put it in the price up front and do not surprise your guests. The whole fee thing is something we experienced on several occasions. Very annoying. We could afford it but I have never had to pay some extra fee at any other hotel in my entire life. The employees just blink blankly when you question WTH are these fees? . . We had a great time and having a nice place to rest our heads made the entire trip more enjoyable...the fee thing took away some of that enjoyment. I just do not like hidden surprises. So there you have it. Paris is beautiful and comfortable.
Was not happy with their service!
In room 1413 can not sleep from the crap that is coming from the pool!!.  Room had beer cans, wine bottles and a condom which I asked housekeeping to take care of.  Safe did not work also had to call to get fixed.  Bathroom sink would not drain and the shower door is broken flooded the bathroom.  Food is not up to the standards of other LV major hotels. Not a good three days.
The hotel was right in the center of the strip, so it is very convenient. Also, it is connected to Bally's and they are owned by the same people so your rewards cards will work at both places. Although they don't take the others' slot tickets. You are paying for the location of the hotel. We stayed in the regular, luxury double queen room. We booked a king but was informed that they didn't guarantee what size bed you get, especially because 80% off the hotel rooms have two queen beds. Oh well. The wallpaper was peeling in a few spots, the first night I took a shower and it was clogged, so I was standing in about  4 inches of water. The maintenance did come pretty fast and was able to fix it. It worked the rest of the weekend. They don't offer coffee pots, you can get one from room service for free but they charge you for the cofee. $3 for 3 pods for the Kuerig . Or you can have room service bring you a pot, for a measly $25. We didn't need coffee that bad! There were stains kind of like rust stains on the carpet that they tried to cover up with an ottoman. The TV was nice, but basic cable. There is a lot of food options inside the casino, we really liked Noch for breakfast In Bally's. You can get a coffee and a pastry for $9. The bakery downstairs, next to the hotel elevators (Cafe Belle Madeleine) has yummy foodies. Everything from Napoleon, to macaroons. And their prices aren't too bad. Ultimately, if you  about it as a great location, it's nice. You don't get much for your money.
Clean, decent rooms. Could use a bit of updating after 15 years. Very good buffet. Overall a VERY good deal for a Vegas hotel and in a very good location.
Stayed at Paris for a company convention. Carpet in room is very soiled/stained. Found blood stains on curtains. Woodwork in room is very knocked up.  Bed linens are worn & dirty. This hotel is in need of a major update. Check- in took over an hour. Service in restaurants is average at best.
