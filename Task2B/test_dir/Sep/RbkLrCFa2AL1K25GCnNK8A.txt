I can't recommend this hotel for 1. Poor location, 2) few amenities 3) no decent restaurants, 4) thin walls and ceilings 5) poor attention to detail.  . . 1- hotel is located on the north end of strip far away from everything including convenience stores. No way to stock up on stuff unless you drive everywhere, and even then, there's no fridge in the hotel room.. 2 - no frills hotel; you even have to pay for coffee.. 3- They've got Benihana - nothing special as it's a chain you'll find in every major city. 4- yeah, you can hear on all sides of you; the kid crying next door, a couple above making the bed squeak early in the morning, and the motorcycles blaring away from the street level. 5- we requested a lamp because the desk lamp wasn't able to be plugged in. Had to ask 3 times total before a lamp was provided, and even then, it didn't provide a power socket like it was supposed to.. 6- ate the hotel's banquet food. awfully terrible. Worst I've ever had. If you hold a company event here, DO NOT ORDER from the hotel's catering service or else you will be in for bland food that causes gastrointestinal problems.
Estuve alojado en este hotel en febrero de este ano (febrero de 2014), y me parecio un hotel estupendo teniendo en cuenta el precio que pague por el. Es cierto que otros hoteles de Las Vegas son mas espectaculares, pero si comparamos precio/calidad, creo que esta muy bien.
Very bad promotions, for those who get offers which I do but not really participate( play $30 get $5), and funny how they have another promo that says ( play $20get $10 in fsp) but cannot use  if you get Sept offers, which is so lame.. Therefore I will spend my money elsewhere, not here at LV Westgate.. I really doubt there marketing dept. reads this But I must say the players club has always been very nice, and slot machines are tight here.
$14/day for WiFi. $0.79/minute to use Internet in the business center. $1/page to print anything (I wanted to print a 61-slide presentation...that obviously didn't happen). My non-smoking room smelled like stale cigarettes. $3.60 to use the Keurig machine in the room or $4 for a bottle of water. This is one of the many hotels to not understand the importance of having outlets next to/behind the night stand. . . The rooms are spacious, but that's about the only advantage. Overall, this place was just blah. I wouldn't recommend it.
The room was clean and they let us check in at 11 am. As long as we didn't have any special requests, which was very helpful.   Just be aware that if you book through Kayak like I did there will be an additional resort fee.  I payed over $20.  And there are people inside trying to get you to sign up for presentations.
If you want to get robbed (Literally and not jus by the slot machines) then go here. we stayed at this hotel because the in-laws had a convention to attend next door.We woke up Saturday morning and went for a walk around town to get some exercise. I was dressed in workout clothes and left my purse, wallet, phone etc in the room because my husband had a key to the room. We had he do not disturb sign on the door because we didn't want to have to put our stuff away yet. We go out, come back 1.5 hours later, get cleaned up and head downstairs to wait for the in-laws before we left for our activites. We decided to put some money in the machines while we wait. My husband put money in, I grab my wallet to get some cash.....I'm wiped clean. . . I know if you're reading this you migh think that I was probably drunk and just lost everything on my own because in Vegas that's what happens right? No. I'm from Vegas so I know how to act and can recall every step from the night before to know for a fact that when we went to bed that night I had $150 in cash in my wallet. We went straight up to the room, searched everywhere just to be safe, and yes it was not there. . . My husband went to the front desk, they called security who came up to our room to investigate. He at first said "So you know there was a safe you could use but you chose not to use it?" First of all, I don't want ANYTHING stolen, so that's what locking the room is for, and my laptop wouldn't fit in the safe so I just have to not bring it just to make sure it's not stolen? And then he said "well we have signs on our doors and in the closets saying that we are not liable for anything lost or stolen. Really!?!?! So apparently this is an issue of yours, that you have to post it. . . My husband said that when we left the room there was a maid in the hallway so the only thing I can think of is she saw us leave, saw us put the sign on the door and noticed I didn't have my wallet or purse on me so she assumed it was in the room. I hope she needed that money more than us because that is so disgusting and I can't even fathom the idea of someone doing that. . . So now security is doing a check on the rooms to see who used their key on our room the day of the robbery and will try and interrogate them. So basically we will never see that money again. . . This hotel is disgusting, ghetto, a crumbling pile and they have theives who work for them that they enable. I WARN anyone staying here to keep tabs on everything and if it won't fit in their tiny safe, don't bring it.
Rooms were nice folks were friendly but for all of the stuff they DONT offer i could have stayed at the MGM -_-
my stay at the lvh was awsome the room was very clean good atmosphere we wer upgaded to a sweet upon arival and it was just off the strip so relaxing by the pool during a great happy hour was a daily must for us
If I could leave 0 stars, I would. Dirty. Gross. Stinks. I'm sad to say I've wasted my money here. 3 rooms later and they had to send housekeeping up to RE CLEAN my room. This was supposed to be for a VIP!!! Crumbs on the floor, hair in the sink. At least it didn't have someone else's toothpaste running down the vanity like the first room. Get new management staff in housekeeping. Someone isn't doing their job. Shameful. . . Honestly, the only good thing I have to say is... Luke at the desk is great and Mr. Peeples (management staff) is kind as well. . . But 3 rooms... Seriously. Get it together.
Since switching from Hilton to LVH, the hotel has improved drastically. We stayed here for a wedding on site, and we had a pleasant experience.. . I would stay here again.
I've always loved the Hilton, even when it changed to the LVH, and now the Westgate. This place was built in 1969, so you can't expect everything to be new and shiny. That being said, they do their best to keep things up to date. Since it has turned into the Westgate, they have been fixing the place up. The rooms can vary, but we've always had good luck here. They have added security guards all over the casino floor, and that seems to have taken care if all the hookers that used to hang out here. Easy to get to the Strip from here with the monorail stop. They are also one of the few places in Las Vegas that still has 9/6 Jacks or Better video poker.
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #9:. it has fallen a bit since its glory days as the Las Vegas Hilton (now it's the Westgate), but still an above average & serviceable off-Strip casino/hotel; absolutely massive sports book, which includes a separate non-smoking area; eclectic and diverse crowd throughout the premesis; I love the big serene indoor lounge with the waterfall at the entrance to Benihana; not much of a place for shopping with many shops surprisingly closed early on a Friday night; sort of ran out of things to do here after a while; didn't like that the parking is separate from the hotel, so it's a moderately long open-air walk; best craft beer bet = hands down, it's at the Burger Bistro, but inexplicably this place closes at 9PM every night - I thought we were in Las Vegas?
Here for a conference.  Toilet plugged. Put on hold to talk to someone about.  Room bathroom smells like mildew.. . Went to get a bagel 6 people behind counter. No one would take my order for 5 minutes.. . Am told conference won't be here again
