Fantastic show!!! It was my favorite show I've seen in Vegas. You need to appreciate raunchy humor to enjoy this show. There was a little of everything. The reviews I read on yelp were very true to form. Don't go to this show if your at all up tight. Acts are daring and a little scary since your so close to the stage. Loved it.
I really enjoyed this show. Adult humor, some nudity, standup comedy and variety acts. Must Go!
Horrible!  They discriminate against people of size.  We paid for vvip and was told after we sat down we couldn't fit there and either go get a refund or sit in the very back.  We paid for front row and only needed the seat moved the 2 inches we were hanging past the seat and they refused saying they need aisles for the actors even thought he would still be there irregardless if the seat moved or not.  My husband is hearing impaired so sitting in the back would be the same as not seeing the show.  Very disappointed with the managers attitude and overt distaste for us being overweight.
My wife and I loved this show.  It was funny, sexy, irreverent, and didn't take itself too seriously.  Absinthe is partially a parody of Cirque du Soleil shows, including one hilarious skit that takes a direct shot at the famous and over-exposed (especially in Vegas) Cirque.  The show is horrendously crude, to the point where the audience isn't sure if they should be cringing or rolling on the floor laughing.  In most cases, it's the latter.  We sat next to a really fun young couple from Australia who kept saying "you could NEVER get away saying that in our country".  They loved it.  . . The jokes are racist, homophobic, adolescent, and highly sexual.  Pretty much all the things we're not supposed to find funny anymore....yet the whole audience was in stitches.  The acrobatics are very good, some are almost frightening, including one where a slip could very easily result in serious injuries to the audience.  Some are quite sexually charged, with attractive members of both sexes on display throughout. . . If you are someone who has never found childish, crude, gutter-humor funny, you probably won't laugh, and I wouldn't pay the high price just for the acrobatics.  Stick to Cirque...where you know (exactly) what you're going to get show after show.   But if you want something different, crazy, and really funny, give Absinthe a try.
Absinthe was Mr. V's choice for the show. I was in charge of food, he was in charge of some entertainment. Absinthe is at Caesar's Palace, so we walked the 1.5 miles from one hotel to the next - yes, I walked in 100 degree heat with suede heels, and yes, my feet yelled at me later. . . This show, quite simply, is not for the faint hearted, but holy smokes, is it a terrific show. It's one part comedy, one part acrobatics, one part strip tease, one part whatthehell. Which means it's terrific all around. I would recommend this to anyone who goes. It was very intimate and close together, with a small circular stage in the middle of the tent. . . They served drinks, but I was abstinent for the remainder of the night, which helped with my concentration. I also didn't want to be the obnoxious OHMYGOD drunk. Because there were a few.. .  My only wish was more nudity, but I think that is always my wish. If my feet didn't hurt as much, and we hadn't already been awake for almost 24hours, then we probably would've went to an off-Strip strip club. Not Sapphire though. Sapphire is terrible. . . I would recommend this show to any and everyone. Loved it.
I just can't believe all the 5 star reviews... This show just doesn't deserve that high, I gave 3 since I was entertained, but with the number of much better shows here in Vegas-it is NOT the best show in town! Is it funny-yes, raunchy funny. Are the acts entertaining-yes, but such a short amount of time is spent on them. Is it intimate-yes, but intimate is only good if you are comfortable... I spent the entire 90 minutes literally in my husbands lap (& he was NOT comfortable) since my only other choice wasto have the stranger next to me's elbow in my chest the entire show...RIDICULOUS!!! It was SO UNCOMFORTABLE!!! These were comped tickets & we had never been before so I couldn't complain about price, but I would be OUTRAGED to have paid $200 for those HORRIBLE seats!!! I HIGHLY recommend paying xtra for seats with cushion & your own table... I've seen just about every show offered here in Vegas & being farther away, yet comfortable & having a longer more cohesive show & paying less $$$ seems to be worthy of higher reviews...
Saw this with three colleagues of questionable (i.e. bawdy) tastes and we spent the entire night with our mouths agape, either from laughter at the emcee and his nutty/annoying but still funny/ridiculous sidekick, or the absolutely amazing acrobatics/feats of strength.  Its super intimate and you are right up there with them.  . . At one point the emcee tells people in the front row not to stand up or they would 'get kicked in the f*cking face' and truly, had they stood up there would've had to have been an ambulance called.  The entire show front to back, soup to NUTS was fantastic, and I'm so glad that I went.  Even my grumbly colleagues were raving about it afterwards.. . My only gripe is that if you're a bigger guy (or gal) seating will be tight for you.  So get an end-seat or a table.  AND go to the bathroom before you go in, because its a straight shot from start to finish and you're not going to want to get up mid-show.  . . And if you're uncomfortable with racial/sexual insult humor, well, go see cirque, because you'd wet blanket the show for the rest of us.  :-)
If I could give this show 10 stars, I would. YOU NEED TO SEE THIS SHOW. One of the very few times in my life I've laughed so hard I cried. KEEP IT UP ABSINTHE
Crude yes but what a great show   Very intimate setting to see some phenom acts  we were wowed on many levels    We had a table in the back and it was perfect   The seats below looked very cramped    Would def go again but would pay the extra to sit in front row   --  so close to the acts . . A must see
This show is the best on the strip. It has everything from comedy to burlesque. Aerial acts. From the moment you walk in the entertainment is non stop. Strong language so be forewarned. I've seen this show 3 times in 3 years. Always has something new to see. Melody Sweets ( The Green Fairy) has a sultry beautiful voice. Come see the show, you won't be disappointed!
NOT FOR THE CONSERVATIVE. You've been warned. But if your liberal, open minded and can take some foul language, this is the show!. . A note on seating...any seat is a good seat! It took a while for me to decide on which seats to select and after reading some reviews, we selected some seats in the back against the wall. Glad we did, you're not going to miss anything. In fact, you'll enjoy the show more cause you're going to be much more comfortable. The lawn chairs closer to the stage are packed really close together, so, if you're packing a little extra weight, don't do it. Also, you'll be looking up for a good portion of the show, which might start to strain the next a bit.. . The acts were amazing. My favorite...the hand balancers. If you've seen any cirque show, then it's nothing too new, but it's an intimate venue that totally changes things up.. . Another note on seating...sit in the back tables and booths are. You'll be much more comfortable. Go check it out!!
Saw it again this past week... still funny as shit!  Penny makes the show, I wish she would have one on her own.  They added a couple of new acts that were totally unnecessary... tap dancing and beat boxing...
Loved loved loved this show! The best part of our Las Vegas experience! Rude, inappropriate, racist - you name it, it was in there. But amazing performances that had us sitting on the edge of our seats. And at times we laughed until we cried! I honestly didn't notice the seating tho I wouldn't sit up front unless you're happy to become part of the show. We booked thru the hotel and got great seats at a great price. See this show!
Such a great show! And not for the easily offended. If you have an open sense of humor and don't take yourself to seriously than check it out! Went on a recommendation of a coworker with my boyfriend and we laughed the ENTIRE time. It was hilarious, the acts were awesome. You aren't bored for one second.
Great show tonight. The wife and I had second row seats. The show was very  entertaining, a little raw humor, cursing but over all a great time.
Raunchy but well worth it! One of the best shows I have seen on the strip. Don't miss this one.
This show is a great mix of gymnastics, beat boxing, trapeze and a lounge act that gets REAL dirty and could be offensive if you are the sensitive type. The main trouble with the show in general is the setting or should I say, the seating. It is crazy how the chairs are literally ass to ass. I sat next to a bigger guy who was half way in my chair the entire time. If they had seating that wasn't so restrictive it would be the best thing on the strip to see! So make sure if you go that you hit the restroom before!
