One star is even too much for this place for their service, first when they were sitting us they took us to a table right next to the kitchen door even though the restaurant was not busy at all, then we asked her to move us she gave us attitude, after all I have been sitting for 30 min and no one even came to take my order. Food is great no complain but service is horrible.
Absolutely amazing! The pasta is the best I've ever had! Everything I've tried has been perfect and I'm amazed at how they got the food so good. . . I've been coming here for years and used to get the wood planked salmon until I discovered the pastas. I've tried all the pastas and have been extremely pleased with them all. My absolute favorite is the pasta carbonara. I hate they closed the one in LA because I want to go here all the time and I'm stuck living so far away! I don't know how a restaurant could get all the pastas so right but if you love pasta please come here! . . I really meant I've never gotten anything off the menu I didn't like, which is saying a whole lot! It amazes me how I can order anything and be totally satisfied. I wish I could rate higher and I'm not generous with my ratings at all...this is my favorite restaurant!. . I love the presentation of the food and the customer service.  There is one in the Palazzo and not only is this one much nicer, this location is open 24 hours. The food is presented better here, which is kind of weird. The service at the Palazzo is also touch and go so I prefer to come here. . . I cannot wait to come back!
Located in the Venetian Resort Spa Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. This 24 hour coffee shop deluxe has quite the extensive menu. The prices are very reasonable and the portions huge. I can recommend any one of the burgers, sandwiches or salads. Everything here gets top marks. Go on an off hour so as to avoid lines. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
It's been a long time since I wanted to give a joint 6*s -  but, I guess if you call everything a unicorn, they are eventually all just horses .. . I really thought perhaps this was a mirage (at 4am in Vegas), but alas...it was the Venetian (womp womp).  The food was truly out of this world!!  I want to write an ode to the salted caramel syrup my cousin had with her chicken and waffles.  I mean, like in Gaelic. Hardcore.  We took some to go, and drank it for "breakfast" the next day.. . I had the Zen Noodles and all I can tell you is, it's some of the best "pho" I've had in awhile!   The lemongrass broth beats plain ol chicken or beef or veggie any day!  You can add the veggies (sprouts, basil, lime) and request the Sriracha (although it was in paste form, and I prefer the chili pepper sauce).  The noodles are big and flat, and I like how they bring you extra broth in a small carafe - aye! que cute!. . My bestie had the chicken parm, and I'm telling you, the portions DON'T PLAY.  If we had been in the same moods, and not so tipsy, I would have shared.  As it were, we had parm the next day for lunch - BOTH of us.  . . I see there are nothing but 4's and 5's down the line for this place, so believe them!. . TIP:  Um, don't go SO drunk you can't enjoy it....and they're open all night (one of the few!). . http://www.venetian.com/grand-lux-cafe-venetian.html
Stayed at Venetian for Labor Day weekend and for 2 nights, we had dinner here.  The portions are huge and the prices are fair, if not bordering on affordable.  A big juicy burger (chop house or mushroom) weighs in at about 1/3 lb with a huge serving of fries on the side for only about $13!!!!  The grilled chicken avocado salad is fresh and delicious, the portion serves 2 people (one if you're ravenous and will fill you to the brim!) for $14.  The Manhattan salad with the option of vegetables and cheese (other options include, chicken, shrimp, and price varies accordingly) rang in about $14.  They don't skimp on the cheese or beans or dressing either!  I eat a lot and the salads were filling!  Complimentary sourdough and butter came with the salads.  I think I got about 3 to 4 large slices of sourdough per salad.  How generous is that for a $14 meal?  Dinner for 2 cost under $35!  Much cheaper and fresher than other expensive places in Vegas.  After spending lots of money at a mediocre buffet (Bacchanal to be exact) with below par quality, this place was a delight!  Fresh quality with large portions at affordable prices is like a dream!  Presentation is worthy of any fine dining (maybe I exaggerate here, haha).  This place is open 24 hours too!
The staff was super friendly and the ambiance was chic for a diner type establishment. . . The egg sandwich and turkey & Brie were perfect for a late lunch! . . Reasonable prices and fast service make it even better!
great spot for a quick casual bite to eat in between being poolside and shopping! their portions are quite large so be mindful.  i ordered the buffalo chicken rolls as my appy -- MIND BLOWN! paired with the blue cheese dressing.. it's phenomenal.. definitely worth a visit!
Great food. A little pricey. No reservations.
Very good service and the food was very good. It is a great place for breakfast good buffet
let me start the review by saying if you haven't been here while staying at the venetian, you REALLY messed up. The ambiance is pretty relaxed compared to any other restaurant on the strip. Came here with co-workers for a bite to eat after one of those vegas nights. Ordered spicy ginger beef and it was AMAZING. Came with veggies and choice of rice. Very well seasoned and not too much soy. Veggies balance out the amount of salt. I tried some of the chicken and waffles, while sober keep in mind, and it was literally the best chicken and waffles experience of my life. I had the same dish at founding farmers in Washington D.C. and was pretty disappointed. The bread is also warm and served with a huge square of butter, im talking quarter of the whole stick huge. Server was very attentive and kept the table updated when the food took a little long to come out. Refilled water multiple times and made sure we got all the bread we can eat.  Great place, wish all the cheesecake factories had this menu, then again theres only one Vegas!
I am not sure why this place got such great review. . . We went there for Saturday brunch as a party of 6. We got seated right away as the restaurant was not busy. Our server took 30m to take our order and he only had another table to serve. Attitude at this restaurant is something else. We asked to place order and other servers refused to take our order or communicate with our server for us.. . It took another 30m for our food to come out, and the food was not that impressive. Nobody brought us ketchup or refill our drinks. When we ask the servers to do so, they didn't want to do that and told us we had to speak to our main server (who was nowhere to be found). At the end, we finished our meal without condiment or water.. . I felt like I could have been better off eating at McDonald. At least, they will give you ketchup there.
awesome service, great testing food and good selection. wine menu was good too of course
The food was okay nothing special. It seems that the food could use a little more spice. The other locations like the one in Texas is much better. We were very surprised that the location was pretty empty.
Got there. Hostess asked if we wanted a high top at the bar or a normal table. We asked for the normal table. When we got to the normal table, they had shoehorned a large party at the next table, with people sitting at the head and foot of the table.  The person at the end basically had their back pressed against our table. We mentioned it was cramped and asked if there were any other tables.  She said no, even though there were plenty of 4 tops open, and no one waiting.  She snarked "that's why I asked if you wanted the high table", although she failed to mention the cramped conditions when she asked.  We then said we'd take the high top, and which point she pointed at it from across the room and said "the one he's cleaning", referring to the busboy.  And then walked off.  We left and went across the way to db brasserie.  They had a nice brunch menu and polite staff.
I grabbed a salad from here for dinner four different nights during my stay at the Venetian. The staff was genuinely friendly and the prices were very reasonable for Vegas. The Grand Lux Cafe is the place to go for breakfast, lunch or dinner if you want an easy and inexpensive meal.
Five stars for serving breakfast 24/7. . . Surprisingly hard to find a breakfast joint after 11 in Vegas of all places and Grand Lux was just what the doctor ordered. Our server, despite this being a pretty casual restaurant, was so good at his job, was fun, upbeat, and all the bells and whistles. . . Aside from my husband's home cooked steak and jalapeno breakfast burritos, I think I had my second best breakfast ever. And my god, do they give you so much food! They gave me six sausage links in my standard breakfast, for example.. . If you're waking up at 2 pm and looking for breakfast, head straight to Grand Lux. It was a wonderful surprise.
This place is the only reason why I like staying at the Venetian. It's opened 24 hours and the food is really good!! I will be back! :). . What I Ordered:. - Grand Club Sandwich. - Caesar Side Salad. - Fries. . I really enjoyed the caesar salad the most out of my meal haha. Dressing was on point!
You wont regret about this place, the breakfast is amazing! breakfast buffet with a lot delicious options, either you need to recover yourself after a drink night or just need a lot of energy to walk the strip this is a good place for that. The price is just right so you don't have to worry about empty your wallet.
