I had the pleasure of staying at this lovely location and to say I enjoyed myself is an understatement!  I checked in and the young woman at the front desk put my boyfriend and I on the 50th floor facing the bellagio fountain talk about a beautiful view! The room itself was comfy with modern decor.  The bed was amazing and the spa tub in the bathroom was relaxing.  The customer service here is great.  Now the hotel itself is a non smoking non casino hotel and personally I liked that. It was quiet and fresh here especially after walking around the strip with smokers and the noise of a casino.  Its also valet parking only. I myself enjoyed that feature. All in all, the hotel is beautiful and I had a great time.  Ill be back again
The draw for this hotel to me is that it is close to everywhere I want to go, it's affordable and has a kitchen. After some not so great dining experiences on the strip, my bf and I cooked in the hotel room.  Be aware that if you get the mini fridge, one half of it is filled with bar goods. So on the other half, with proper meal planning, we were able to hold about three days worth of food. Not bad.. . As far as our room, I found the bathtub to be really too high to get out of safely. I'm sure if I needed a step, they would have provided one. However I am a young woman, just short. I literally was jumping to get out of the tub.  . Also, there is so much lighting in the room but really no central light. That seemed silly to me.  Lastly, be aware that they hold your card for one hundred dollars per night for up to five nights and there is a daily 28 dollar resort fee. . . Overall, for this location, the area and the cost is great.  My only suggestions are for the gym facilities. The gym smells clean and looks clean but I must question how clean it really is. There is no equipment cleanser specifically for the machines. I was forced to use the hand sanitizer to clean the machines before and after use. One day I walked in to use one of their cardio machines and there was a slick of sweat left on the handles as well as a puddle of sweat underneath the floor where another hotel guest had just worked out. Also, there are complimentary headphones but no way of knowing if they are used or unused because patrons would use them and throw them back in to the wooden baskets alongside the unused headphones. Plenty of plastic cups and bottles everywhere but no clear area for recycling these items.  TV in every cardio machine but there was only one working remote for these TVs in the entire gym of which there was no backing to cover the remote's batteries.
I loved it here when I came in August, the rates were perfect and we got an upgrade to the panoramic suite relatively cheap. $250 a night for a weekend stay Friday-Saturday.. . I'm not a huge fan of the noise in hotels with casinos and I especially hate the smoke, it gets in my hair and my clothes. You can't walk out of a hotel without smelling like you've been in a bar all day. But mostly because I'm asthmatic, it's easier to breath without all the smoke at Vdara. The lobbies were clean and the elevators were amazingly spotless as well. The concierge and front desk were efficient and accommodating.. . Our suite had a pretty amazing view that was 270 some degrees, the bathroom was gorgeous, the room was super spacious and comfortable. It even had a separator door if you wanted to close off the bed to the living room. We also had a large fridge and kitchen, not to mention a washer and dryer (all which we put to good use). We were living the high life. :) For room service they have these cool doorbell ringers that you can turn off to let the maids know not to disturb you. I believe white light means "empty room", green means "come clean", and blue was "do not disturb".. . Vdara only does complimentary valet, but you can park in Aria or Cosmos self park and walk, it's not that far and you have access to your car at all times. The close proximity was great as we were clubbing at Marquee the next day. We were able to walk. :D. . I would definitely come back to Vdara next time if given the chance.
What a great hotel to stay at. I like Vdara because each room is a suite and if you have a guest or two they can sleep on the pull out bed thats hidden in the sofa. The decor of my room was the typical trendy chic style. The bathroom is pretty nice. There is a soaking tub, standing shower, comfortable toilet, and two sinks. Also, there is a kitchenette with a fridge and a sink. I only have two complaints 1, the small fridge doesn't get anything cold and 2, the remote to the tv sucks ass. Other than those two complaints, I would come back here for the next Vegas trip.
Very disappointed with the service. i couldn't check in cuz apparently they overcharged me and i had to wait for head cashier who went to lunch just in time for check in.ugghhh
Wow - the best hotel experience I've ever had.  We booked for my birthday; and they upgraded the room for us, had concierge waiting for our arrival, and made everything as magical as possible.  Yes - magical.  Amber checked us in and was so sweet and knowledgable.  We rented a cabana for a day (DO IT!) for one of the best deals in Vegas, and Katie took care of us; always available, but never annoying or overwhelming.  The views are breathtaking, the maid service is phenomenal, and the hotel is impeccable.  I was super impressed by the rates, the convenience of the location, the design and furniture, and the outstanding service.  Best kept secret in Vegas.  You will not be disappointed.  Plus, the smell they pipe in is amazing, definitely different than the stinky air fresheners you get at some of the other resorts.  Steps away from the Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and Crystals Shops.  Thank you, Vdara!
Pro: very nice staff! Area is beautiful and food exquisite! Con : not a totally clean room at arrival
Oh, I love this place! My girlfriends and I found a great deal from hotels.com (I think). It was actually a mystery hotel, so that's why we had a great deal on it for two nights!. . I like that it came with a mini kitchen. :). . Minus one star because the kitchen didn't come with anything. Normally, hotels with a kitchenette has everything you need for the kitchen! Oh well, the hotel was still awesome!. . *No parking garage, valet parking only but it's free. . I'm done with my Vegas phase, but if I do ever decide to come backI would try to stay at Vdara.
For our short getaway to Vegas, we decided to try out the suites at Vdara since they had good deals online and because of the prime location at the City Center next to the other big hotels (it is connected via walkway to Bellagio & is by the monorail that takes you straight to Aria & Monte Carlo). It was pretty crowded when we got there on a weekday during the summer, but check-in was a breeze and we were given our keys right away. . . Our deluxe suite was pretty nice considering the price and location on the Strip. Upon entering, there is a fully-equipped kitchenette (just need to call down for any pots, pans, or utensils that you need) and small dining area. Depending on the layout, there may or may not be a short wall diving the bed from the couch/living room/tv area. The bathroom was also very spacious, with a separate tub and shower and plenty of counter space for all the toiletries. . . Only a few downsides of this hotel: 1) There is no casino, so if you're looking to gamble you will have to cross the walkway and find your way to Bellagio's casino or talk a walk outside to Aria or the Cosmo. 2) There is no self-parking, so getting your car in and out of valet is a bit of a hassle during peak hours. 3) The dining options available are limited to mainly the Market at Vdara & Starbucks downstairs. But since it is on the Strip, there are plenty of other eateries to walk to nearby.
Sleek, modern hotel that's smoke-free in the middle of the strip.  I loved it!  We stayed in a panoramic corner suite with a pretty amazing view.  . . One big negative was that our a/c was broken and we called them 4 times over a span of 3 hours and the person at the front desk kept saying they were sending maintenance over to fix it.  My butt!  The thermostat read 82 degrees inside when we set it to 50 degrees.  We were sweating our asses off.  That's truly unacceptable, especially for claiming to be a "luxury" hotel that charges exorbitant room rates.  Plus, once the maintenance guy came, he said he was only notified about the problem 15 minutes prior!  We were pretty cool about it, but once my friend complained, we got our resort fees waived.  It's the least they could have done, but honestly, they should have just done their job instead of jerking us around saying they "sent" someone. . . Don't get me wrong, I really liked the look and cleanliness of this hotel, but if this would have happened again, I'd rather stay elsewhere.
Loved everything about this property! . . Crisp clean decor, great location, wonderful staff, fitness centre & spa.  A quiet, non-smoking oasis in the centre of all the action.. . I will be back.  My new favorite hotel in Vegas!
Close to the strip without all of the craziness. This is a non-smoking, casino-less hotel. It almost feels like an apartment complex. Overall it was relatively quiet - we went on a weekend and apparently it was high school graduation weekend so there were some 'rowdies', but mainly in the lobby (i.e. noise wasn't really an issue in our room). Room is well appointed, very spacious, and well kept. There is a Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel, a small bar, and a deli. What we loved most about this location is the fact that there is a covered walkway directly into Bellagio, allowing us to avoid walking a good chunk of the strip. Would definitely return.
My first vacation with ny boyfriend was soent here. Gotten a free upgrade and along with it came an amazing view. The staff is great and friendly. I highly reccomend and can't wait to go back again :)
The guest rooms are beautifully furnished and intelligently designed.  One small but significant example of the thoughtful design is the fact that there are A/C outlets above the night stands on both sides of the bed - we were able to charge our phones and tablets overnight without having to leave them on the desk or in some other remote location in the room.   Frankly, I'm surprised that ALL hotels don't provide this simple accommodation.
Vdara is now my favorite hotel.. . . [How is it different]. -No self parking- only valet (which wasn't that much at all). -Non-smoking and no casino inside. That's a good thing!. -There are a few options in the lobby such as a fancy market cafe, starbucks, something else I think, and a good size bar.. . [Rooms/style]. -We had a corner suite with 1 king size bed and 1 bathroom. For 5 guys, that was plenty.. -Living room had a couch with a pull out bed (Springs hurt). -Carpet was just as nice so perfect for my inner Asian.I used a sleeping bag over the couch cushions. Legit!. -Restroom was extremely nice: 2 vanity's, 2 sinks, shower/tub, toilet with no door, and closet for the fancy clothes. Ironing board+iron+hair drying were in there to use.. . -Small walkway held small vertical washer and dryer (bring some detergent and bounce if you need it). -Master bedroom and living room had flat screens. -Kitchen area was legit. . . Overall: plenty of room, quieter, less smoking, and checking in was extremely easy. Had to call because flight came early to check in earlier and we had no problems. Very accommodating.
My girlfriend's leg is broke so we wanted to get away for my bday after staying locked in the house for 4 months (long overdue vacation). So we decided to get the panoramic suite for 3 nights and just hang out in the room the whole trip.. . The Panoramic suite was gorgeous but we didn't love the fact that they gave us one on a lower floor next to the tram, so we put in a request for another room but higher up. They only had it available the next day and said it would be on floor 27 with a better view. So the next day we go down to the lobby to exchange rooms and they were having a little trouble so they told us to come back later in the day.. . We return from our day out on the town and speak to someone at the front desk about switching our room. My girlfriend tells them it's my birthday and we would love the best view possible. The guy leaves and talks to his manager then comes back and tells us they are upgrading us to the hospitality suite for our last 2 nights!! . . We finally go up to the room on the 46th floor and could not believe our eyes! It was a huge living room area with a full kitchen and island in the middle. 2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. We called everyone we knew to catch a flight out to Vegas to come share this room with us but we didn't have any luck. . . Anyways the rooms here are beautiful, clean and modern. The customer service is beyond amazing and the staff is definitely some of the best Vegas has to offer. There isn't a casino (smoke free) in Vdara but Cosmopolitan and Aria are just a few steps away (my girl has a knee scooter for her broken ankle so if she can roll across the way on her knee scooter, you shouldn't have a problem walking there lol. . . OOOOO. 5 out of 5 Afros
Wow! Most rad room I've ever stayed in while in Vegas. It's a sweet suite, complete with a kitchenette (stove too) and a nice living space and mega bathroom. Our view is sensational from 50th floor. The pool area is lovely but the pool itself is tiny- like a kid pool, really. Excited we have access to the spa and fitness center as well. Right now I'm giving this a 4-star review based on esthetics alone. Maybe it will earn a 5 after I stay a while?
My boyfriend and I were in town for five days during the Mr. Olympia Competition, since he was competing we stayed at the vdara because there is a kitchenette in each suite. . This hotel is amazing. I absolutely hate the smell of all casinos it's disgusting, but when you walk in the vdara it smells SOO good. It is a stark contrast to most hotels in Vegas. . There is only valet parking, but they are extremely fast. It was seriously the best service, I wish I remembered the name of this particular valet guy, but he went above and beyond all expectations. He got our car in 5 minutes or less and had the hotel send a complimentary fruit bowl to our room and on our last night he had them send up champagne and chocolate covered strawberries!!!! . The gym facility is beautiful, and the pool is great even though it was crowded.. Vdara is a bit pricey on the weekends, but well worth it. If you are looking to "do Vegas differently" and stay away from casinos and the hustle and bustle of the strip, this is the perfect place.
We got in on a Thursday and were able to check in by 1pm.. We had a panoramic suite which was amazing minus the minor details.. The assistance from the front desk to over the phone was great!. We got upgraded to a penthouse suite because our rooms AC was not making the room cool at all, the sofa was uncomfortable and the bathroom light would flicker throughout the night. One other flaw was that we called twice for some pots and spatulas to cook but we never received the spatulas so we couldn't make breakfast.. Besides that the rooms were amazing, clean and very up to date.. I would love to stay here again because of the amazing service and im glad i do not have to walk through a huge casino.. The hotel is located behind cosmo and aria so getting a taxi may take awhile but it is a short walk to the other hotels or you can take a tram.
We stayed here for 6 days for my 30th birthday.  Got a cabana at the pool and I must say, for the price of the cabana..it should include a bottle.  I had about 8 people total, the cabana itself was $200 that included an apple, an orange, 4 bottles of water, 1 kind bar, some chips, a safe, a tv, chassis lounge chairs, and a little couch.  When we gotour final bill after buying some snacks and a bottle of grey goose($165 for the bottle). The bill was over $600!!! I was appalled. Ive had a cabana at the stratosphere for cheaper and it came with a bottle. I mean I understand location but thats a little ridiculous if you ask me. When we didn't have the cabana we had purchased a couple of pitchers which served 4(my hubby and i shared 2 pitchers and we didn't even catch a buzz) $44 each i think they were. If your gonna charge that much for drinks the least you could do is make them so you can actually catch a buzz/get drunk.(I mean, why else do people drink alcohol?!) It was a nice hotel with good happy hour in the lounge downstairs but thats about it. We did order room service one time for dinner on my birthday and after we had told her how much we spent at the cabana she felt so bad that she actually hand delivered some chocolate covered strawberries to us at no charge. We thought that was super cool of her to do. Valet was extremely fast when it came to getting our car which was also another plus. The AC worked extremely well and kept our suite nice and cool the whole time. I had a friend stay with us for a few days and she stayed on the pull out couch but after the first night she just slept on the couch because it was a HORRIBLE pull out mattress FULL of springs sticking out! The so called "blackout" curtains weren't blackout curtains. I actually got woken up EVERY morning from the sun shining in through the cracks in the curtains.  Like i said it was a nice hotel with a great view of the Bellagio fountains, the Eiffel tower, and the high roller, but we will never stay there again...just way too pricey unless we were at happy hour.
I was very excited to step into this hotel for the 1st time on my last trip. When I got there, first impression was terrible. . . The parking lot is very confusing to find! It's like a maze to get to the parking area.. . When I got inside with my friends, I was very excited to let them know that I had a "buy one get one free" buffet that I wanted to use from playing myVegas. They told me that they didn't have a buffet. They also told me that they did not have an MLife?!? Then why the hell are they are affiliated with myVegas? Whoever I spoke to, didn't know what the hell was going on. They made me walk to Aria, which was the "closest" area to redeem my points. Unnecessarily, walked over there. I told them what happened, and they gave a look of confusion themself. They told me that Vdara has an MLife and that they couldn't redeem my buy one get one free buffet for Vdara, which I already knew. But, because Vdara told me to go to Aria, I did so. . . So, I had to go back to the Vdara, talk to them and go through the whole process again, because again they didn't know what the hell I was talking about, so I had to walk back to Aria for a second time and explain to them what was going on, again.... . Aria told me that I couldn't redeem my buffet points at any of the hotels at the time, because it was Labor Day weekend. That was understandable. But for Vdara to tell me that they did not have an MLife and could not redeem my points for their buffet, is stupid. Again, then why would they be affiliated with myVegas? It doesn't make sense.. . Vdara showed me a very bad first impression & I don't think I would go back there again. Looks like they wont be makng any money from me, EVER. Waste of time for me. The only reason why I gave it three stars, is because it is a really nice hotel, that is it!
The hotel is nice. Two stars for non smoking. However checkin was horrible. We arrived at 3:30 and our room was not ready and they told us it would take an hour. It wasn't ready til 5:30 and it was smelly and not very clean. We asked to be switched rooms. We almost missed the Zarkana show because of their tardiness in getting us a room in time. On day of checkout, we asked for extended checkout which is 12pm. I got a coffee and when got back to the room at 11:15, the key was deactivated and I couldn't get in. They sent a bellman but took a while. I stayed with Vdara before when it was brand new and the service has gone downhill. Not staying here in the future.
Loved this hotel. Easy check in. No loud casino to hike through. Classy, modern. Next time I'm in Vegas the city view suite will be my 1st choice. Equipped with washer/dryer/kitchen/stove/microwave/refrigerator in the kitchen make this a perfect home a way from home. Room service was fast & accommodating to every request small or big. Concierge got us on the guest list to see Tiesto at no cost ... although they neglected to make our dinner reservation on the right evening, they made up for it with a complimentary bottle of champagne the next night.
Last night was the second time I have stayed at Vdara, and once again, it exceeded my expectations. . . Upon booking my room (the Panoramic Suite), I decided to put some special requests in with my reservation. I've had a rough couple of months and asked if they could put a framed photo of Ryan Gosling on the nightstand as well as a written compliment to cheer me up. I also asked if I could have a room on a higher floor for a cool view. I did not expect any of these requests to be met and even wrote that I would understand if they could not be met.... Now to my actual arrival.... . Tad, an incredibly friendly gentleman, checked me in. He offered a winning smile and informed me that all of my requests had been met, including my request for a room on a high floor. He then gave me my key for a room on the 54th floor. . . I was anxious to see the view from so high, but did not expect that not only was I high up, but they had upgraded me to a one bedroom penthouse suite! The room was remarkable and the view of the Bellagio fountains and Strip was just extraordinary. They also included a 3 sided frame with photos of Ryan Gosling (as requested), a compliment written on the notepad, and a laminated printout of Gosling that said "Hey Girl, stay strong. I believe in you". Their attention to detail and willingness to go the extra mile to make a guest happy is just wonderful. Aside from the dream-like room, I also had a wonderful dining experience.... . I decided to order in room service so I could enjoy my room longer. I ordered the airline chicken breast served with mushroom and herb risotto and spinach. To drink, a bottle of UINTA Brewery Seasonal beer. The food was impeccable. Not only was this the best food I've had through any in-room dining, but it was also some of the best food I have had at any restaurant. My compliments to the chef! The gentleman who brought up my meal was also incredibly kind and set up my meal in a beautiful display on the dining table. . . My time at Vdara was perfect. The friendliness of the staff, cleanliness of the resort, sleek designs, and attention to detail were all 5 star! . . After having 2 perfect stays, I can say with certainty that I will always be staying here. Vdara will forever be my Vegas home from now on.
Hands down the best hotel I've stayed at in Vegas! The first time I stayed in the two bedrooms suite. They had given me the two story one but I did not like the layout and they quickly upgraded me to the single story two bedroom suite. The room had two separate rooms with the kitchen n living area in the middle and the rooms on opposite sides. One room had a king bed and a master bathroom and the other had two queen beds with a regular bathroom. There was also a third guest bathroom and the couch turned into a pull out bed. Great for a large party.. My second stay here was in a regular room that was still very spacious. Had a kitchen and living room as well as the king bed. . . This hotel is very modern and extremely clean! Staff is very nice and helpful.
