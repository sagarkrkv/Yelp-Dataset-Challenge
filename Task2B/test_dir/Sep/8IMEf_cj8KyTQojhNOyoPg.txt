Venue: Rio All Suites Hotel & Casino. . Decor: Red, Purple, Blue(ish).  . Service:  Decent.  . Environment:  A Younger Vegas.  . Food:  Different venues (Whopper Bar, Village Seafood buffet).  . Prices:  Not too bad.  . Debbie Downers:Perhaps it needs to be on the strip but then again off the strip isn't too bad depending how you look at it..  . Conclusion:  Great thing it is right off I-15 on Flamingo.  Plentiful parking, decent entertainment venue, rooftop lounge (Voodoo) overseeing the skyline.  Huge Pool area.  It is an above average hotel & casino for your food, lodging and entertainment needs.  Carries multiple of shows.  Options between the Masquerade Tower or Ipanema.  A viable option to stay if you choose to stay off the strip.  .  . Overall: B
The Rio is really great for what you pay for.  I've stayed here multiple times, and will certainly be back.  BUT, I think they need to start checking the rooms to make sure everything works from time to time.  The desk lamp with charging station was inoperative (no light, no plugs worked); 3 out of 5 lamps in the room had bad bulbs; one lamp had a busted lamp switch; the curtain pull on both curtain and drapes was broken; tub took 20 minutes to drain after my shower.  That said, it's a room and you basically just sleep in it.  The casino is great, the pool area fabulous and restaurants are really great.  The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because of al the things in the room that didn't work.  So, the Casino, Pool and other amenities get 5 starts from me....but the actual room itself warrants 4 stars.  However, i WILL be going back there so don't let my complaints about the room send you away.  I really like the Rio.  Easy to get to, easy parking, shuttle to/from the strip.....I'l be back!  Oh, and you cant beat the price!
The room was beautiful but the beds could be softer. Great view and good AC. TV had less than basic cable, mostly local networks and Cartoon Network. Casino was clean but I wasn't on e offered a drink after several hours of playing. Pools were nice but jacuzzis were pretty dirty and they closed about 6:00 pm. Very odd for a Vegas pool. . . Here's why it only got two stars. After first day noticed a $100 charge that was explained to be a security deposit. They made no mention of this at check-in. Then on 2nd day nearly $100 more charges of mini bar purchases that I never made. $10 bottle of water and and $55 WiFi charges. WiFi charges! Something that Motel 6 gives you for free! They removed the charges but told me it would take several days for the refunds to hit my bank account. . . Left town hundreds of dollars poorer not from the slots but from underhanded business practices and charges for things that the most basic budget motels don't charge for.
I decided to try something new and book a off the strip hotel. The Rio was the perfect choice. I paid around $26 dollars a night including taxes and resort fees (I do get hotel discounts through my employer.) I arrived at the hotel around noon, check in isn't until four so I opted to pay for early check in for $20... Well worth it to settle in and be able to enjoy the multiple swimming pools. As I was checking in the lady at the front desk told me that my room included $9 per person, per day to use at Starbucks. For me, that was a unbelievable perk! . My room was very large, it was a basic suite, had everything that one would need including a fully stocked minibar. Room service could have done a better job getting it prepared for us, but it was clean and comfortable. The actual resort is unbelievable, there are three swimming pools one that is designed to look like the beach complete with a sand bottom, and multiple hot tubs... Plenty of shade and you can watch people zip line over head. The pool wasn't too busy, midweek in September, but the people we met were very friendly. I didn't eat at the restaurants, I opted to have dinner on the strip which is easily accessible via a free shuttle that runs every thirty minutes until one a.m. However the hotel offered many selections and had a very reasonably priced gift shop that sold sandwiches to take on the go. I would stay at the rio again.
What were we thinking??. Apparently we weren't when we booked what was told to us be a four-star hotel.  Really?  I think 3-star would have been plenty generous.  . . How can they still call these rooms suites??  The last time I stayed here, the rooms were REAL suites.  And no, it wasn't when I was 10 years old and things maybe seemed bigger when you're smaller.  I was an adult, though a poor college student.  Our room this time was half the size of what a suite should be. What a rip.. . I call into question the cleanliness of the facilities.  When we arrived we saw a lot of debris in the hallway - our room was at the end so we saw it all.  This included a piece of smashed bread in front of a particular "suite" that stayed there for another day before it was cleaned up.  We woke up the next morning to see a suspicious looking Rio shopping bag in front of our door (prob filled with barf based on the celebratory noises that woke us up in the wee hours) that stayed there for most of the day as well.. . On top of that, it doesn't appear that there's any security....at other mid-grade hotels, they at least have someone checking room keys before letting you up the elevators.  I guess they assume here, you'd have to be staying here to want to go up to the rooms.  . . The old adage you get what you pay for is definitely evident here:  early early morning drunken pounding on doors, smelly shower curtains that maintenance never replaced at the behest of THEIR OWN MAIDS, smokey casino and all.
Never go to the Rio buffet. Sooooo salty you can't enjoy your food. Disappointed, and 67 dollars short. Sigh... NOBUENO.
Samba Rooms Rule!. . We were staying at the Rio for a week with a comped standard room, and after reading some of the reviews I was a little apprehensive about staying here...to the point that we reserved a room in another hotel for later in the week, in case things went sour. In the end, it was a very pleasant and enjoyable stay at the Rio!. . We arrived near midnight and didn't have long to wait to check-in. Instead of the standard room we upgraded ourselves to one of the newly renovated Samba rooms in the Masqueraded tower. The room was very nice and very big. Two double beds, a couch, a safe, a minibar and a separate fridge (that came in very handy) and there's a window in the shower...it that looks onto the sleeping and sitting area...curious location for a window.. . Anyways, we did stay for the whole week and cancelled the other hotel plans. The casino itself was fine and didn't reek of cigarette smoke. I found all staff members, regardless of their position to be very friendly and courteous. The cocktail waitress were lovely and came by frequently asking if we needed any beverages.. . . Pros. fast elevators to our floor.. hot, hot water for the shower and bath.. the shower head was an energy saver shower head, but it was still powerful.. . . Cons. our room had adjoining room via a locked door...very noisy when someone in the next room is standing near the adjoining door and talking.. noisy hallway...you will be wakened from your sleep with people talking in the hallway...glad I brought earplugs....although Ive experience this noise in other Vegas hotels.. if your a light sleeper you might hear highway traffic and railway train noise if your room faces the strip.. the TV is a nice modern Panasonic, but the signal to the TV in non high-definition and the setting on the TV has the images stretched from their original 4/3 image to a 16/9 image which could not be changed.. met other guests in the elevator, on two separate occasions, they were very unhappy with there rooms and were on their way to talk to the front desk.. Kleenex and toilet tissue are institutional quality.. The vending machine on our floor was charging $5 for a soft drink...really!?. . . . Tips. walk over to the Gold Coast Hotel for inexpensive liquor and beer, but first sign up for a loyalty card at the Gold Coast and get 10% off you liquor and beer!. walk over to the Gold Coast to gamble, but beware, the cigarette smoke will sting your eyes!. cut through the Gold Coast and head over to the Palms Casino to gamble...it has a decent food court and an movie theatre too.. there's a small grocery store, Green Valley Grocery, located at the intersection of S Valley View Blvd and Twain Ave...its a 10 minute walk if you want to grab some snacks, juice, bottled water, milk, etc...but do not go there on foot after dark...I noticed few undesirables lurking about...there's also a Chevron, another 10 min walk at E Flamingo/S Arville St.. find the Burger King in the Casino and grab some free WIFI, and the two Starbucks might have free WIFI?. Take the shuttle to Bally's or the other shuttle to Harrah's...the shuttles leave every 30 minutes from 10 to 1 pm.
While this isn't the Bellagio, it is very adequate. I stayed in here on a business trip with 9 of my colleagues and it truly fit the bill and the price was fantastic. TV's were great, but the cable selection being piped in was less than desirable...and not HD. . . It was super convenient, and I would come back in a minute.
These "suites" are horrible. Don't stay here if your expecting a good experience. Slept 2 nights in a hot room and no compensation. I guess that's why a lot of their restaurants have closed. Try closer to the strip.
WE FOUND A USED NEEDLE IN OUR ROOM..... . On August 20th, my family and I drove to Las Vegas for a short trip before my kids went back to school. We decided to stay at the Rio Hotel resort and Casino. While we were there, we had a great time. The pool was nice, the concierge was very professional and the Voodoo Zip-lining was amazing. . . As our trip was drawing to a near end, the last day we were there, we discussed extending our trip and staying the weekend. As we browsed the internet to check availability, my three year old daughter walks up to me and hands me an exposed needle. I quickly but carefully take the needle from her hand and ask if she was hurt by it and she reluctantly said no. I then proceeded to secure the item and checked my kids for any bruising or traces of blood. I ask my daughter where she got the needle and she told me it was in the couch. I couldn't believe a needle was in the crevasses of the couch in which my kids were playing on and jumping on. Keep in mind, we had already been staying there a few days and I thought to myself and said, "If they missed a needle, what else could they have missed". I began to search the rest of the room for anything else out of the ordinary.. . I was infuriated and called the front desk to speak with a manager. I spoke with a manager and her name was Rosana. I explained to her what happened and expressed how upset we were with how irresponsible the cleaning staff was to miss something as dangerous as a needle. The manager apologized for the incident and we had to make a report of the incident however everyone involved acted like it wasn't a big deal. The supervisor that came to our room picked up the needle and walked out with it, no plastic baggie, nothing. Then another guy came to our room to collect the needle and we said it had already been taken care of. Then he came back a while later because he needed a report. It seemed that no one knew the proper procedures to take place for an incident like this and took about another hour and a half of our time while we were trying to leave. Considering the risk and that this is a safety issue and what could have happened, I would have thought they would try to be more apologetic or at least try to offer some type of compensation to try to earn my business back. . . It made me sick to my stomach to think that my kids could have been hurt or killed by this exposed needle. We don't know whose needle that was or what they did with it before it arrived as our roommate. We have decided to never stay at the Rio or any of its affiliates. Not to mention the large collection of dust and debris on top the TV stand and on the carpet that looked like it wasn't cleaned for an exceptionally long time, and no one acted like this needle thing was a big deal. . . Overall, Rio will never have my business and will never be a place my family and I will stay. I can say that our experience at the Rio will scar our memories as well as give us another reason not to go to Las Vegas for a vacation.
We just stayed here and not to happy with this hotel.  Went to the Pool and it was freezing during Sept and everything is over priced. Customer service workers do not care about their guest. Ordered a tuna sandwich and they gave us wrong order we were charged $17.  No drink or side included told we could order something else so played safe ordered a hamburger and there is a difference in pay. I told them and she said she would have to get manager over a hamburger we felt like we were not  treated as a guest but that we were bothering them. During lunch:eating the worker told us to go the cashier and that Mgr wanted to speak to usthat he would give us $2.00. Unbelievable service !. After a day of spending money on drinks and a expensive bag of chips. Manager was very rude& didn't care & I told him.  Gambling at their tables and machines and never winning once between the both of us.  Very strange hmmm.. We r not ur penny gambling people Say no to the Rio...Anyways next day we went to older part of Vegas and gambled and won nice people than our own hotel we made the best out of ur trip by just sleeping there and going to other casinos we wont be coming back to the Rio they do not care about their guest. 9/12 to 9/14 was our stay...unwelcoming stay....they want every penny and don't care if u return or not ....!
We arrived here this Monday. For a mini honeymoon as we just got married two days ago. We went to get a players club card at total rewards. I got my card no problem. Then my husband walked up and he had never received a card there before so the employee Paul (I believe) explained the benefits to him. Then he said if you get the late night munchies if you know what I mean you can get a discount. I said excuse me and he said yeah I smell it all over you guys. I said are you accusing is of smoking weed? I said yes I smell it too but that is NOT my husband. We are drug free!!! Just married ready to start a family. Are you kidding. I spoke to the total reward manager who defended the employee before apologizing. We will gladly take a drug test. My husband is black and was the only black person in line. I think he was definitely racial profiling. The manager apologize and sent us on our way. When I started to cry he then added 25 dollars comp on my husbands card. Wow. What an awful experience and way to start my 4 night stay. I will never choose them again.
This was our 2nd time staying here. Love the rooms (spacious), a safe for all your winnings, or losings LoL! Great casino and all amenities within a comfortable distance, and easy access.  The casino is lively, dancers (a MUST see!), Drinks abundant, plenty of slots and great game and video tables. The surroundings: shops, restaurants, all within easy distance from one another. Great buffets. The Voodoo Lounge, is just awesome. This club on the roof has an awesome, breath taking views ."Voodoo Lounge Music Style: Live music, Hip Hop, R & B, and House."  Another Must ...Breakfast or Lunch at THE HASH HOUSE. You won't believe their unique and huge portions (Picture worthy!!)  The CARNIVAL WORLD BUFFET is amazing for dinner!  There is a great variety of eats. Smaller eating venues, reasonably priced, as well. A bit of shopping to soothe your needs surround the casino and interior of the hotel. Huge pool area is equally as good, with several pools to choose from. A walk down sand beach pool, water falls, bar and convenience shop.  BTW: you will always be surrounded by friendly staff!
3 Stars at the most would be all that the Rio would get from me! I got a chance to experience the Rio this past weekend that my cousins visited for the Mayweather fight weekend! This hotel was only chose because it was apart of a package that was booked via expedia I believe. Even though I know we checked in on a insanely busy weekend I feel that's no excuse to have less than enough staff working the front desk to check in the guest. We stood in line for at least 45 mins no lie... Anyways to add insult to injury as soon as we get to the front a girl behind the desk tell us "oh I'm not taking anybody else right now sorry.. Then we go back to the front of the line only for another representative to walk away from their window as well?? wtf where is the customer service around here? After check in was complete on our way up to the room that was located on the 3rd it was alllllll the way at the end if the hall '___' if you are looking to do Vegas on a budget this place is good however be prepared to have your walking shoes ready because it's located OFF the strip you will need to take a taxi becauseit's too hot to be walking any long distances in Vegas! The carnival buffet is good but it's not the best..
I've stayed here on a couple different occasions. Once a long time ago when the Village Buffet was hot. Another time for an all girl weekend excursion.  My last stay was for a convention. I love... The pool. It has a beachy sand area so it makes you feel like you're some place tropical- but not really. It kind of reminds me of the Mirage. Eating at the bar top of Bizou (seafood restaurant) wasnt bad. . The rooms are nice and pretty clean. Ive slept on the pull out couch before which isnt as comfy. I like my rooms cold so i had to turn the AC to 65 degrees.. The crowd here is much different from what you would expect at....The Cosmo for instance. It's a mix.. Perk? A shuttle runs every 1/2 hour and will take you to Bally's or Harrahs. Go to the back of thd building pass the valet. There are signs indicating which waiting area is for what.
After, escalating my incident further from my last review I have to bring them back up to a 3. If I didn't have to complain and escalate my issue myself rather then them taking care if it right away I would have giving them a 4. After my complaint I gave to say that they have taken care of the employee, as well as my husband and I. . . Good. 1. Pool is amazing . 2. Rooms are huge . 3. Both buffets . . Bad. 1. No coffee in rooms. 2. Poor customer service at total rewards (but was taken care of after some persistence)  . 3. No 24/7 cafe. No late night meals. Like good breakfast deals.
I took my daughter here for her 21st birthday and what a mistake I made!!! We rented two rooms and to begin with the carpets were filthy in the room and hallways, one room the sofa a ripped lining which hung on the floor. The alarm clock made this really weird humming noise and I had to unplug the makeup mirror was broken and had no light as well as the base was broken so it listed to one side. When you flushed the toilet the outside sink gurgled for a few minutes. I asked for two non-smoking rooms and one stunk of cigarette smoke.. . I stayed at the Rio for three days and one of my rooms was not cleaned for two consecutive days. When I called housekeeping they tried to say that we were in the room too long in the morning but we were up and out by 11AM each day. The Rio has two pools one with a waterfall and another that is heated were kid mainly enough themselves. This pool was absolutely disgusting. The white tile had a filthy black ring around it. Once I returned home I completed a survey sent to me by the Rio and I heard nothing but once I posted a review such as this one on Trip Advisor I was contacted by the Total Rewards depart offering me an upgraded room the next time I visited. . . This tells me that they in fact had cleaner and better maintained rooms if you pay extra, otherwise you get filth, no housekeeping services and tattered furniture. I would have to be out of my mind to throw good money behind bad. Keep in mind that the Rio "All Suites" Hotel and Casino is owned by Caesars Entertain who also own Caesars Palace, Paris, Bally the Quad and a number of other "Strip" properties. It's clear to me that the Rio is there "Ghetto" property where they clip poor unsuspecting tourists who are trying to save a few dollars while on vacation. . . Since my return I have done extensive research on this property and the vast majority of the negative reviews are consistent with the property being a poorly maintained dump. Don't believe the glitz and glamour that you see on the Discovery Channel this place truly sucks and management knows about it. . . BUYERS BEWARE!!!!
I'd like to edit my previous response though the registration line was stupid long and not cool.  Guess it was rush hour in there?. . It actually was a pretty good time and the view of the strip was deluxe. Wish I'd eaten at their steakhouse with the panoramic view.  . . Shower head was mad confusing though, the geriatric head spouted water all over me and the floor which resulted in unexpected wetness.. . You know where this hotel would kick total ass? Atlantic City.  It can't compete in Vegas as everything in Vegas is so over the top, but if you're cool with standard stylings, large rooms, and plenty of weekend potential to visit other places, this place will do you well at their generous price point.. . Power plugs are behind the mattress, ladies and gents.
I have NEVER had such a horrible experience at a hotel. First strike, I tried to check in with two different front desk employees and they had the worst costumer service they were very rude, smart remarks, and were not helpful at all! they charged me for 3 reservations. I asked two different front desk employees to cancel them, they said it was cancelled. I later speak to a manager and she had to cancel because the reservations were still there. One a good note I was refunded for the 2 reservations. Employees were quick to throw this situation to their manager because they were lazy and did not want to handle the situation. I was unable to check in until I finally spoke to a manager. The rooms were not bad; however the cleanliness of the hotel I rate a 4 on a 10 scale. Game employees didn't have the best customer service, they also seemed rude and unhappy to be working, weren't polite. . . Lastly, it took 1 hour for bell service to finally come up and get my bags. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless you're on a serious budget.
I like this casino even though it took eons in the valet line before we got up to the attendant.  We were like this place is busier than ceasar's & Bellagio.  We came to see the MJ Live show & stayed afterwards for drinks & tried our luck on the tables.  The Beatles lounge & the others are nice.  And, more importantly, lots of hot chicks eye candy.
In 2012 I was working in Las Vegas every other week, so I got to try almost every hotel in Vegas... I loved the Rio... except its proximity to anything. . . People always say its just off the strip... technically ok, but it is across a freeway over the strip. I love the food options and have no complaints whatsoever... we even go to their seafood buffet when we aren't staying there.. . I booked a room and I guess they overbooked rooms and was upgraded to a suite!! WHAT!?!?!?! And the suite was beautiful. I was sad I was there for work and not with hubby... that huge room all alone for a week :( but no complaints.. . I highly recommend this hotel.
Highly disappointed. First thing was you have to pay $13.00 per day for wifi. WTH???? The hooker hotels have free wifi and I'm not dropping $$$$$'s there and a $40 breakfast. Second. Put A/C down to very cold. Never got below 80. I've been in way better rooms for the money. Not a place I'd go out if my way to stay at again. . . Here for 3 days so far and have not heard one alarm or people yelling as if they were winners. This place is tighter than a frogs butthole.
Needs a serious cleaning,  we stayed there because of the convention.  So at least it was free.   The shower doors have mold. Restaurants are way overpriced. You can go to the strip and get far cheaper food.  I would never pick this hotel for a vacation. In the restaurant, you can not substitute at all.  So customer unfriendly.
Let's see where to start.. First if you decide you want to get clean after arriving into town you might want to try a better place because their sowers are horrible. Sprinkles ate much better then this shower. Secondly i booked a room for 3 nights at a rate of 47$ a night so around 160$ total. A friend of mine booked a month and a half in advance due to attending the 5linx conference and paid 637$ for the 3 nights. Being told they were getting the best rates because the convention was extremely big and so many people from this company booked with them and it was supposedly the best rate around until she seen how much we paid. Pricing needs to be fixed because this is outrageous tripled the price. Third when calling house keeping expect to wait 30 minutes to and hour for anything, and that is even if u are able to get through to them. This was the worst place to stay even for the price. Away from the strip and being a 4 start hotel i could have stayed at a 5 star.  Don't recommend unless it's very convenient.
