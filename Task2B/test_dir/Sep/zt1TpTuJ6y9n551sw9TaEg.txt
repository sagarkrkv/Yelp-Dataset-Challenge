I was so excited to come here after seeing it on food network and when a friend said it was the best. Good thing we didn't have to wait long because I would have been so mad to wait two hours for the food. First of all, the crab legs they put out was still frozen. Second, there was absolutely no fresh cut fruits. Really? A buffet with no fruits? And the dessert bar was mediocre. Sugar free chocolate gelato? Yuck!! The waiter hardly came by to clear the table. We paid $47 a person. Totally not worth it. The Wynn buffet is still the best for the value.
Great selection of food but pretty expensive and the food is a hit-or-miss. My favorites were the papaya salad, smoked salmon, heirloom salad, salmon eggs benedict, bolognese gnocchi, and the gelato bar. There were some other things I ate where I had one bite and ended up not finishing it because it tasted bland or so bad that I contemplated spitting it out into my napkin. . . The fact that there are two lines: one to pay and one to wait for a table was pretty ridiculous. If you're going to pay $40, you shouldn't have to wait in two lines. Both lines took pretty long and we waited an hour and a half in total. . . Overall good but won't be coming back.
This was the coolest brunch I've been to. Great selection and presentation. I like that it's served as individual portions not as a huge pile of food to scoop out. Very fresh, gourmet options. I got so full I didn't even get to the desert area. We got there early and had zero wait time. Service was great too. Delicious!!
Aside from some dirty silver ware, the Wicked Spoon is my favorite buffet in Vegas.  They have everything, and I mean everything!  We had breakfast/brunch here while staying at the hotel and although pricey at $45, we at least had a buy one, get one coupon.  From Chinese food, to salted peanut gelato, you name it, they have it.  The fried chicken was very very good, as was the nutella gelato.  Get there early to avoid the lines, and try everything you can.  Well worth it!
I think this place is a little over rated. We went here for lunch on Sunday and the presentation of the food was amazing but everything I ate was salty. I'm not sure if it was my tastes buds or just the food that day buying guess I will give it another try just to be fair.
We are here for Sunday brunch.  We waited in line for about thirty to forty minutes (not too bad). It cost about $40 per person.  We thought that was a little expensive for locals but we wanted to try it out.  I enjoyed the small portions and the dishes they came in.  Very interesting idea.  There was definitely enough food to choose from but not of it was the greatest.  I don't think I would go out of my way to recommend this place but it was something worth trying.
Breakfast ... . 5 Stars. Why? . A. Best service in Las Vegas. . B. Best food I ever experienced. . C. Good variety of desserts. . D. Omelet makers were the best to talk to and made delicious omelets.. . TIP: Angry Macaroni and Cheese = The best.
After checking in this was our first stop. Amazingly decorated. Great service.. . I tried a bite of practically every dessert on their dessert bar which was extensive and beautifully put together. Fried chicken tasted like it was fried with a coat of sugar, ah-mazing! The angry Mac was also spectacular. Couldn't eat for like 12 hours after but it was so worth it. Go here!
Worst buffet Ive been to on the strip. Cost as much as any five star buffets and just doesn't even come close. Waited an hour and a half to be seated. Right around 2:30 pm there were empty trays. Running low on food in a buffet. I paid 50 bucks for a spicy mac and cheese? There is no way in hell that dish can justify a 50 dollars a person buffet. I do have to mention that there were some insane tourists there. There was a young Chinese guy who wanted to take a whole tray full of sushi back to his table for his company. A manager had to run after. Him and bring the tray and the food back. It was actually hilarious to watch.. But not 50 bucks hilarious.
For 20 something dollars, I could understand some of the 4/5-star reviews detailing brunch. But for $50 at dinner, it fell short.  I'm certain I didn't eat $50 worth of food, my fault for not eating everything!!!  If I tried a bite of everything they had, I would totally pass out from a food coma without really savoring and enjoying (that's why I'm a bad candidate for buffets).  Plus, we had seafood on our brains, wanting everything under sea, especially a variety of crab.  Failed!  All they had were snow crabs. I suppose AYCE lobster is out of the question for $50.  Stop being so unrealistic, Gigi!!!. . I did like the shrimp cocktail shot glasses!  Very convenient, tasty and cool spin to a just pile of shrimp as I've seen at other buffets.  Bone marrow was another yummy treat, haven't seen that anywhere else.  I love bone marrow (and clogging my arteries)!! Gelato station was a nice touch.  No white chocolate covered strawberries, only dark chocolate!  Booo!!!  Prime rib was just ok.  Nothing else really caught my attention.  A few other complaints from my table were, not a wide variety and items like bread/pastry were stale and even hard.. . Our server was friendly and attentive, I appreciated that.  Didn't appreciate the attitude from a worker at one of the stations. Too long to detail the incident, but I wasn't being out of line.. . Will definitely opt for Bacchanal instead next time.
I had heard great things about this place and was super excited to come for dinner buffet.  Unfortunately, I didn't like it as much as I was hoping I would.  A lot of things were great (I really liked the lamb curry, prime rib, and mini taco), but the selection was a lot smaller than I had hoped.  This may be because I went to bachannal a few nights before, but I still felt like the diversity in food was not great enough for the price.  Luckily, my group came in with a few 2 for 1 vouchers from United, so I walked away content with what I got.. . I will say though, definitely try to gelato!  There are a lot of flavors- I asked for the best 3 in a cup and they were all pretty delicious (I got thai tea, candy bar, and salted peanut butter).
I think this place is overrated. Their desserts are okay. . . Sushi: did not look fresh so I did not eat them.. Chinese food: the worst fried rice I have ever eaten.. Pork loin was too tough.. macaroni was tasty. . My boyfriend and I spent $80 but he barely ate anything. Totally not worth it.
Despite the numerous recommendations and people telling me I had to try this place, I resisted because, c'mon it's a buffet!. . This buffet is huge! And judging by the stockades set up to manage the line, it's gotta be popular. . . We opted for the unlimited bloody marys for $12 each, cheap by Vegas standards. They're small, pretty tasty, but also pretty week. . . The food looked really good, several sections of stations were well showcased. I saw some atypical brunch items; sushi, risotto, carbonara, and watermelon raspberry smoothie shots, just to name a few.. . I didn't get close to trying everything, but the items i did try were decent, especially by buffet standards.
DELICIOUS!!! Nice ambience, great food! I especially love their freshly made fruit juice. Oh! Their dessert selection...HEAVENLY! I'll definitely bring family and friends back to this place.. . Definitely worth the $34 for brunch.
Vegas is about about the clubs and buffets.. . I'd compare wicked spoons to Marquee night club... You'll see many hungry people and all sorts of dishes to fulfill your appetite?? ( do you see my comparison?? yes, no? ok ). . My friends came around 1130am on a saturday and the wait was no longer than 20 minutes. Perfect! We weren't ''buffet hungry'' but by the time we got to the front, we were ready to see how wicked this place is. ( I'm cheesy). . There were many small dishes that tried to prevent us to excessively take more than we could handle. My personal favorite was the smallplate of egg Benedict . It was cooked to PERFECTION... first bite had yolk dripping down my plate.... DROOL.. . The dessert selection was absolutely sexy..yes, i said it..SEXY.. .. . overall-. I'd come again my next time around.
To start things off, let's make one thing clear. This is definitely one of, if not the best buffet that Vegas has to offer. You know that when you're visiting  Vegas you have to at least make one buffet stop while you're here. And to me this is the one that get's my vote. . . Starting with the ambiance, which the buffet is located inside of the Cosmopolitan hotel as I would consider to be very "chic".... whatever that means lol. So you can pretty much be dressed up, but also come casual. It has a very nice feel when you enter the place and all the times that we've went there for either lunch or dinner it really never seems to be that packed. There's a lot of tables in the seating area. And is pretty spacious so you don't get that feeling that you're touching elbows with the table next to you. . . Now to get to the food to which the Wicked Spoon does probably the best in my opinion compared to other buffets. You can definitely taste the quality in the food that they have and what makes it even better is that they give you these portions where you're actually able to go to each stop and get one of each.....honestly! How amazing is that! And if you like a certain food just get a lot of it. To me this is what stands out the most with the Wicked spoon is that they have the portions laid out for you. Now...I know what some of you are saying that the buffets portion be on the person, but just trust me and try it for yourself. . . Another strong point that the wicked spoon has going for them is their dessert choices. Mostly with Vegas buffets or any buffet for that matter you're limited to the usual ice cream and sub par pieces of cakes, but with the Wicked Spoon you have a variety of sweets! It's great!. . To sum everything up, you really can't go wrong with this place at all. Good food and good service just make sure you bring good company lol. . . Thanks for reading my review! Hope you like this place as I would highly recommend it when visiting Vegas.
Expensive and not even mediocre. . The selection was not extensive, the food was bland, and it was hot inside. The only thing that made it semi-worthwhile was the dessert selection. The raspberry macarons were very good. . Save your money, save your time... Eat elsewhere.
(This was probably closer to 3.5 stars to me.)  The Wicked Spoon has a _huge_ selection of food.  Most of the food was very good, and a lot of creativity went into many of the dishes.  However, some of the dishes had imbalanced flavors or had been sitting out far too long.  My favorite item was actually a juice -- their passion fruit-mango-raspberry (if I remember correctly) "Wicked Juice" was outstanding and I went back many, many, many times for more.  There were stations for breakfast foods, fruits and vegetables, carved meats, Italian, Asian, and pastries/desserts.  The staff was friendly and efficient (especially our waitress, Lisa!).  It's a very pretty restaurant, rich in ambers and browns.  I particularly liked the amber-colored glass-drops that were suspended like raindrops around large glass structures (like unlit chandeliers).  The buffet is pricey -- another example of how the days of the $12 Vegasbuffet are gone, I think, at least for high-quality food -- but you can eat your fill of good food.
Better than Bacchanal?. . 1. wicked spoon 2. bacchanal 3. bellagio 4. aria 5. wynn . . that's my top 5 in that order.. . Bacchanal vs Wicked Spoon!  Fight!!. . Round 1  - Decor. . New round from my regular selection.  This place looks and feels awesome.  Doesn't help that a wedding party with a beautiful bride and groom was sitting near us.  Seriously, if a couple sees a hotel buffet glamorous enough to hold their special occasion at, then its a pretty darn nice establishment.  It was just a beautiful place to sit and eat at.  You also don't hear the noises of slot machines and bonus chimes echoing within the dinning establishment.  The bathrooms were large and clean.  I wish my house's bathroom looked like that.. . Bacchanal is a classy modern day retro feel.  You have the textured yellow and orange seats with translucent square glass separators everywhere.  Sorta feels like the threshold of the 70's and the 80's.  The buffet area was well lit and visible from most of the corners of the room.  Outside was a view of the pool and the pretty people that walked by, something you don't get at wicked spoon.  Overall, a swanky place to eat at.. winner - Wicked Spoon. . Round 2 - seafood. . Seafood really belongs to the M or the Rio but lets compare these guys.  Wicked Spoon really has a limited selection to offer.  Crawfish, cold crab legs, and prawns are what sticks out in my mind; however, they do it well.  The cold crab legs are nothing special really.  I'm starting to believe that all these buffets purchase their crab legs from the same shipping crate that gets shipped over from Long Beach.  If any dares tell me that Buffet's A crab legs are better quality than Buffet's B, i'd like to sell them some "vintage" dollar bills for $10.  Lets clump sushi in this round, cause we like sushi.  They have a miso soup station which is very nice to have.  Prepping  your stomach for sushi with miso is always good.   The sushi selection  (dragon, tiger, ginger something, spicy tuna, etc) are a much BETTER selection than Bacchanal.  It's quality is also better as you can see the chef's prepping for it right there and seemingly knowing what to do.  I do like their creamy wasabi as well.. . Bacchanal has so much to offer at it's seafood station.  They have little dishes that enhances some of their seafood offers.  Do not go there without trying their scallop spinich dish.  Soo freagin good.  There's an entire station dedicated to these unique dishes.  Once you get into the crab legs and oysters, they serve an assortment of dressing to go with it.  Everything is fresh and delicious to eat.  Their sushi is Sub-par.  (Par - average/mean/baseline).  Yeah, i said it...subpar.  You can go to sushi-boy or some place off flamingo rd to get sushi after bachannal if you really want it.  With that said, they still win.  (That hurts because I'm a big sushi guy).. Seafood - bachannal.. . Round 3 - carvery. . This one is going to be tough.  Wicked spoon had so much going for it.  Thick hickory smoke apply bacon, the freagin bone marrow, and a near perfectly done prime rib.  Let's not forget the crispy chinese pork with hoisin sauce.  so good.  They had sausage links that I did not try, but I bet it would have been just as good since the rest of the meats were terrific.  What hurts them here is not offering (at least when I went) a lamb dish.  yeah, maybe you won't care for it, but its just one of those things that stands out when comparing buffets.  Quality of meat is excellent though and i wish they had a plated surf and turf station like the Aria next door.  . . Bacchanal, if you've read my other post, was alright.  It really is not its forte.  The lamb is probably the best thing they have.  The prime rib is slightly better than average but not at the level of the wynn.  I would venture to say they're about the same.  Wagyu beef is not impressive if it's made into a slider.  If you're going to eat that Wagyu beef slider, share with a friend first and see if you can really spot the difference.  Probably taste the same as if I would have gotten it from BJs.  They have a chinese station as well, but it's really not as good as wicked spoon.  I believe wicked spoon even serves chow fun, but i might be mixing that up with bachannal.  . winner - wicked spoon. . round 4 - variety. . This is wicked spoons round.  there are so many dishes that I don't eat cause they sound expensive.  My friend literally said, this is a plate I would order outside at a 4 star restaurant.  This dude works for the A's.  Anyways, Bacchanal had some unique dishes like the wagyu beef, spinach scallop, & chicken and waffle, but they pale in comparison with wicked spoon.  Wicked spoon - custom BYO mac and cheese (delicious), truffle polenta something, chinese roasted pork,  ramen station, braised beef/pork tacos, a bunch of other things...go look at peoples pics.  Yeah it really isn't a comparison wicked spoon wins.. wicked spoon. . Round 5 - dessert N/A cause i only had gelato. . Go to wicked spoon @ $50.
(2.5 stars). . Overrated.. . My cousins and I came by for dinner on a Saturday night with extremely high expectations. If you're reading this in line for this buffet, do me a favor and drop ALL of your expectations. You'll probably be satisfied in the end.. . I will say that I do love the selection they have here. They all come in these fancy little presentations that call for serious picture taking. And don't get me started on my love for interesting ingredients and delicious flavor combinations. For instance, orecchiette pasta with mushrooms or candied bourbon carrots? That's my cup of tea.. . With that said, I was disappointed in a lot of the food they had here. A lot of their dishes are either under seasoned, over seasoned, too rich, too dull, etc. It's never a consistent "just right" with the dishes here at Wicked Spoon. For instance, their tandoori chicken was extremely dry and hard to swallow. Their pan roasted oysters in red sauce? Too many conflicting flavors.. . Not to mention, there's a TON of food that I've read/seen in reviews that weren't among the selection the day we went. Instead, there were a ton of uninteresting dishes. And on a Saturday during dinner?! Weird.. . They also don't have an extensive selection. Variety wasn't that great.. . The only thing I liked (oddly) were the shrimp cocktails. And that's as basic as it gets.. . As for the desserts, I did enjoy the white chocolate mousse cake. Not too overwhelming and just right. However, everything else I tried, form the gelato to the rice crispies treats to the macarons were too sweet.. . I don't know... Maybe it was just an off night. However, I will say that my table was unsatisfied with their meals. There were some hits, but there were more misses if anything. In the end, we wished we went to Caesar's for Bacchanal.. . 1 star for the presentation of the food. 1.5 stars for the service.
I think this is the best buffet in Las Vegas (better than Bacchanal). For a buffet, the food is amazing, with an overwhelming mix and selection (steaks, sushi, Chinese, Mexican, and a thousand other dishes in between). The place also looks very nice - a contemporary look that fits well with the Cosmo's aesthetic (which itself is beautiful). . . Like other fancy hotel buffets in Vegas, the price here is high, though it fluctuates depending on whether you come for lunch or dinner and whether you come on a weekday or weekend (higher prices for dinner, higher prices for weekends).  So if you want bang-for-the-buck, eat lots of lobster/crab legs and lots of meat. . . Vegas is all about pushing yourself! I recommend the various steaks and the scalloped potatoes, and would steer clear of the sushi (it's mediocre).
Pricey but all buffets at Las Vegas are anyway right?. Selection was amazing, good meat, really good cheese, a variety of shrimp and the icecream was delicious. . There is a line to go in so expect a bit of wait to go in and for sure come hungry so you can satisfy with the 40 bucks you are going to pay.
TOTALLY AVERAGE BUFFET. let's break it down into 5 categories...  . The food is defiantly doesn't taste the way it looks. I remember going in and seeing plates and plates of beautiful food, that makes your mouth water. Once you taste it  all goes away. I think they were too focused on presentation and not on the taste it self. If you don't believe me go ahead and just keep reading  more comments and pay and find out why we say that.  Oh and I was soo upset that I had to start a yelp account just to say how plain the food tasted.. . . 1. Price - Paid $90 + tax for 2 ppl (locals receive a SMALL discount) .   . 2. Overall Food Quality -  Nothing of outstanding value... Yes presentation of food is "pretty" but food itself is nothing special. Tried a good variety of what was available. .   . 3. Location/Ambiance - Beautiful and clean.. . 4. Service Level - Its a Buffet so don't expect much, not personalized but decent.. . 5. Dessert &Beverages - Great selection and taste.
We have eaten at the Wicked Spoon two times now.  We decided to do this one because our 4 & 2 year old kids are free.  The first time we had the breakfast buffet on a Sunday.  It was OK, nothing that really stood out to us.  . . Last night we tried the dinner buffet hoping our meal would be better and we could finally understand the hype about this buffet...there were several selections like Chinese, Mac and cheese station, meats, salads, gourmet cheeses, tons of dessert options, pizza, and several other things.  The best thing I had was the shepherds pie.  The worst was the lamb Indian dish which had small chunks of fatty lamb.  I would take a bite then had to spit it out and chew around the fat.  My husband found a long black hair in his food.  The server offered him a free drink to make up for it.  . . In my opinion the best part was the dessert station.  All of the desserts were very good and huge selection.. . Next time I think we will try the Bellagio or Caesars Palace buffet.
For breakfast hands down 5 stars.  Wynn is excellent for breakfast but Wicked Spoon out does them with the attention to the little plates. Some of the best of the best:. . Shrimp cocktail in a little glass with the cocktail sauce in the bottom of glass. . Chocolate covered strawberries rolled in health bar bits. . Fall off the bone bar-b-q ribs. . Salads on little plates already dressed. . It's just a very well done breakfast buffet and one I will return to. . . I have only eaten here for breakfast; lunch and dinner experience unknown.
If all buffets were like Wicked Spoon, I might become a buffet guy.  . . The thing about me is that I don't like to gorge.  Eating pounds and pounds of mediocre food just to get my money's worth doesn't appeal to me.  I prefer to taste, not gorge.  I like to taste lots and lots of little items and experience as many flavors as possible.. . And if you're a taster like me, Wicked Spoon is heaven.. . Wicked Spoon is the first buffet where the majority of the food comes in individually portioned, small and bite-sized dishes.  This made me a very happy boy.. . Aside from this unique quirk, Wicked Spoon is a fairly conventional Las Vegas buffet.  On the other hand, it's quite gorgeous, with more chandeliers and more stylish decor than most.  There's typically a line to enter, but I managed to avoid it by dining at off hours -- 7:30am for breakfast, and 5:30pm for dinner.  . . (Side note -- I had free passes to the buffet thanks to my Cosmopolitan rewards program, so I got to experience both breakfast and dinner at no cost -- sweet!  But expect to pay through the nose if you purchase a buffet pass yourself.). . The foods run the gamut in terms of style and quality.  The strengths lie in the desserts, I think.  I loved the macarons and apple cobbler and molten chocolate cake and endless flavors of gelato.  Every single cake and tart was perfect.. . The savory foods were a little more mixed.  The vaguely "Asian" foods like the General Tso's chicken and pork fried rice were tasty but bland.  (Also, who eats buffet-grade sushi anyway?)  Same with the Mexican foods.. . On the other hand, the American-style foods, like the fried chicken and roasted bone marrow and salmon with pea puree, were quite excellent.  The various salads were fresh and delicious, too -- especially the beet salad, asparagus salad, various takes on a green salad (spinach and kale), and that kickass caprese.. . I could spend hours detailing every dish I tasted, but that would be pointless, since Wicked Spoon's selection of foods changes on the reg.  You'll have to pay it a visit and see for yourself!  Just be sure to bring your appetite.
Good buffett... but not worth the extra $$$.  Quite pricey if you ask me.
"Meh. I've experienced better," is exactly what I was thinking. Dinner here on a Friday night was very underwhelming. I expected A LOT more out of this buffet. My favorite was the antipasto bar, all I which I could have probably prepared at home myself. The meats were too overcooked for my taste and I didn't care to eat much of the pasta choices. Signature mac and cheese bar was about average. Disappointed doesn't even describe it!
I went here three years ago and was impressed. I loved it!!! But came here last week on a weeknight and what a bummer. The food wasn't that good and definitely not memorable. The bone marrow was good- but thought I was going to break a tooth if I ate the toast you're supposed to eat it with.Is it really supposed to be that hard?!!! the desserts weren't that good either, cakes were dry! I ate at the Paris buffet and their food was better during breakfast than this place at dinner! We ate here againthe morning we left, on a saturday morning and it seems like they wait until the weekend to really get the good stuff out. The food was definitely better and the desserts didn't seem like they were left overs. I would come again, but maybe on a weekend brunch.
Amazing brunch. Presentation was great, food was excellent. Overall, a very pleasant experience. Not overpriced for this quality of food and service.
Good gourmet buffet dinner, very different from the norm buffet. Tasty and a lot of exotic food. The desert something to die for. Gelato Ice Cream, different flavors and their mousse, my favorite the Pistachio chocolate mousse and the macaroons. Not crowded, take your time to dine no pressure. No kids running around or no babies crying. Wow, their Prime Rib, melts in your mouth, very tasty. Highly recommended! The only thing I don't like is the wine doesn't come with your dinner. The bottle of wine, Cabernet is $20.00 :( . I don't like Cabernet anyway. Try it!!!!
Fabulous selection. Everything was great quality, a large variety to choose from. Staff was all great. Pricey, but worth every bit.
Went back to Wicked Spoon last week. I believe it was my 4th or 5th time there. I feel like the quality overall has gone down. The presentation wasn't as immaculately pretty as before and many of the dishes were just okay this time. The atmosphere is still great and service is wonderful but I think if I'm in the mood for a buffet the next time I'm in Vegas, I'll go over to Bacchanal.
Awesome. . . As a pescetarian, I enjoyed the choices. Ate so much of those darn glazed carrots that I swear I was an orange hue on my way out. . . I had to be wheeled out in the wheelchair. Almost. . . SO FULL! . . Their salads are pre mixed, and many of them contain cheese. So vegans will be distressed. . . And the lay out is a bit random, but that allows for ample ooing and aweing at the variety. . . I WOULD EAT HERE EVERY NIGHT... if my stomach was humongo. . . I swoon for wicked spoon.
Wicked Spoon is the Cosmo's buffet on the Strip. It was $25 for lunch. Their selections were pretty standard with the salad, carving, brunch and omelette station, asian, italian, and dessert.  The setting is pretty cool with a black and orange color scheme. So, let's talk about the food.The only items that were memorable was the grilled house cured bacon, congee, and bone marrow. The fried chicken were seasoned with curry powder which tasted weird to me. The pork fried rice was bland and the shrimp "takoyaki-esque" balls were undercooked. They got some unique foods like a goat cheese and lavender panna cotta and a watermelon slice marinated in sriacha and lime. I thought most of the food here was pretty rich tasting (i.e. garlic bread, mushrooms gratin, eggs benedict). Even their salads were pretty overdressed that the salad was shining with olive oil. I will say this though...This buffet wins on presentation. The chicken were served in small fry baskets and the fried rice was in a chinese take-away box. I would probably give this place another chance and try go for dinner to see if its better. Oh btw, DO NOT eat the gnocchi here. The sauce tasted like the canned sloppy joe sauce i had the week before...
Absolutely delicious! The variety of food is amazing and everything tastes as wonderful as it looks. The staff are polite, friendly, and cheerful. Definitely worth the price!
I really liked how they had various gourmet plates in a buffet setting, you know, things that you won't normally order at a fancy restaurant, i.e. watermelon with Sriracha and lime drizzle. The selection for salad and meat were substantial and they had a mountain of king crab legs for the customers. Prime rib was good, sushi was "meh"... my favorites included the sausage, roasted pork belly, and OMG the huge dessert bar. . . Overall, I wasn't impressed by the buffet and they didn't have much of a seafood selection. Food quality was definitely better than typical local buffet, but just "OK" for Vegas.
If you want a good buffet in Vegas that's worth the money, I would probably go for the one at Caesar's Palace.   Wicked Spoon is pricey for what it offered.  No oysters, no lobsters, not a huge choice of sushi.  In terms of quality, yes, the food was pretty decent.. . I expected a bigger desserts option but the desserts here were somewhat limited.  The salad bar was good, the seafood bar was pretty much non existent, and seriously not worth the money.. . I probably wouldn't go back.
Definitely over-hyped. I expected some good food for $50, but instead I got mediocre food. I got full off of trying things here and there, but not full from enjoying from my food. . . There are better buffets in vegas. don't go here.
Not sure I'd say I got my $52 worth of food, but I did sample a lot of dishes. They were tasty, but the gelato bar was to die for.. . Entrees on a whole were ok (3 stars), but the quality of the desserts is what bumps it up to 4.
When in Vegas... You have to eat as many buffets as possible. . . High points -. Dessert is amazing! . Gelato, lemon tarts, macaroons, eclairs, and super tiny cones of cuteness . Wicked spoon dessert bar is so much better than bacchanal Buffett's. . . . Keep in mind -. -Alcohol not included. -You can get unlimited house red or white wine for $12 a person . -Unlimited sodas, juices, and coffee. . . Low points -. Their Asian food has a lot to be desired. Mac & cheese bar seems very exciting but huge let down. . . Overall not bad but if I had to pick 1 buffet in Vegas it would be bacchanal Buffett.
The Wicked Spoon is definitely my favourite buffet primarily because of their amazingly decadent dessert bar! . . The place gets crowded but is very well managed.. . All the food options are good and well worth the $40 a plate.. . Note: Avoid the Asian section though.
Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal, that is the debate.  I almost think they go back and forth as to who is better based on how they are doing for the week.  Still, I like the Spoon and come as often as I can.
Top notch buffet* so glad I came here.. Roasted bone marrow !!! Soooo amazing.. I put it on toast and it was a true revelation.. Lots of good choices.. .charcuterie !! . .siracha lime watermelon- Mmmm mmm. .roasted meats-turkey,sirloin well seasoned . .some Asian selections-all very tasty . .nice salad bar with some nice cheeses. .nice desert section. . Place inside is very nice, a lilts but of walking to get to, but definitely worth the wait
If this cost 30 I think I would have been impressed but not really so much.  First the service is great!  Reason for the four stars, food alone would be three. Good selection of meats, few veggie dishes, good desserts.  Many items are broken down into small individual servings.  Crab legs are cut in half for you and cold.   Chinese , sushi section...  Really no other international foods.
nice buffet lots of choices...I agree with another reviewer (Jacqueline L) that the desserts were amazing and the Asian selections were not the best.
This is one of the better buffets I have ate it during my trip to Vegas but even this one isn't so great. Maybe I just had bad luck when it comes to buffets in Vegas or maybe I don't know the best buffets to go to. Anyways, I love the interior of this buffet. It look very clean and cosmopolitan. I guess that's why it was in the Cosmopolitan, lol. However the food is just average to me. While there are many items here that you wouldn't get at a typical buffet, the food here just doesn't stand out or astounded me. I think this place is overhyped. I waited about two hours to get inside this buffet and I wasn't pleased with the quality of the food here. The desserts however was great but the lack of cheesecakes was very disappointing. The food here isn't so bad but it isn't so great either. Definitely not worth the price. I came with a party of four and the overall bill at the end was about $255. Yikes!
Both the appetizer/cold dishes and the dessert sections were impressive. The hot food sections were less impressive but I love the bone marrow in particular. I came when there was only 1 line and a very brief wait, but would not find it worth it if I had to line up more than 20 mins. . . Overall the food is above average, but while the waiter was initially very attentive and even came back around to ask us how our food was, he neglected to refill our drinks upon request and didn't take our plates away. This was on a non-peak hour Wednesday evening.
The mister and I had spent months gearing up for our trip to Vegas and wrestled over which buffet we would end up at over and over again. We managed to watch a bunch of those food network / travel channel specials on the best buffets in Vegas and reluctantly decided on the Wicked Spoon. . . I don't know if its because I had too high of expectations or that maybe I'm just not a buffet person, but I only thought it was just OK. . . We went for dinner, and I tried a little bit of everything, but the highlights were probably the made-to-order macaroni and cheese bar (5 stars!!) crab legs (can you really mess those up?), and the prime rib. The mussels were meh and some of the Asian inspired choices were also meh. . . I tried a handful of the desserts and nothing except the gelato was really memorable but I'll give them an A for effort in terms of the presentation. . . I don't know if I'm willing to shell out the money again for another mediocre experience when there are so many other buffets to try on the Strip, but I guess if you're a buffet-a-holic this one is probably up there as far as the quality and quantity of what they offer.
We love buffets, Vegas had bomb ones. This one wasn't as good as others we've had. It was great, don't get me wrong but not incredible. However : The eggs Benedict, the French toast & the wicked passion fruit juice were 5 stars  the rest was meh. A lot of the other items were dry from the heat lamps I though. Service was great too, very friendly and helpful
Notes (for dinner):. . -It looks beautiful inside there, without a doubt the nicest buffet I've ever been in. . -The food is REALLY tasty. There are some not as great dishes for sure, but it's the selection that makes this place great. It's so great to go through and be able to sample so many unique dishes (the lamb curry really stood out to me). . -Best moment: The Mac N Cheese station! The chef Maciel was SO incredibly nice and attentive, I asked him to make me his favorite thing (without seafood) and...just wow. I am a self-proclaimed Mac N Cheese connoisseur, and this thing blew me away. It didn't even taste like Mac N Cheese by the end, it basically transcended what I thought one could do with Mac N Cheese. Absolute compliments to the chef.. . -Worst moment: For some reason you have a waiter to bring you drinks, which is already kind of weird because we're already getting all our food by ourselves anyway. Our waitress came by after we'd been there eating for 10 minutes already, then brought our drinks, then....nothing. Multiple moments of her seeing our glasses empty but not stopping by, which was just weird because that was literally her only job.
Definitely not worth the $88 my husband and I spent.  There are waaaay better buffets in Las Vegas and the casino buffet I usually go to in San Diego (where I'm from) is 100x better than Wicked Spoon. . . Cosmopolitan is an overrated, overhyped place.  It looks beautiful in Wicked Spoon, but their food was too "hipster" for me.  Sriracha lime watermelon?  Wasabi mashed potatoes?  Over salty bone marrow?  I'll pass!  I like high quality food with less gimmicks.  There was not one dish that satisfied me.  They didn't even have seafood here.  *insert WTF face* Will never go back here and will not ever recommend. . . 2 stars for the fast and friendly service and pretty decor.
***DO NOT WASTE TIME OR $$$***. I live out her in vegas so I have had my fair share of buffets and what have you... I kept hearing how wonderful this place was so I finally convinced my family to give it a try on one of their trips out... I felt SO BAD for wasting everyones time!!!!. . the food was terrible.... nothing was worth waiting for or paying for... . . honestly the buffet at Green Valley Ranch was WAY WAY WAY better and for half the price!!!!!
The reviews I read we're highly overrated. There were actually dishes I spit out?!? The tuna poke had the worst flavor and bizarre gummy consistency. It was like chewing on a gummy bear that sat out in the sun. There was a chow mein dish that was so over cooked. You didn't need teeth to chew it. The desserts were good, but that was kinda it. Go to the Bellagio if you want a good buffet.
1;14pm on a Saturday. No line!. . Service is attentive and friendly.. . Bone marrow was fantastic as usual. . . Dessert bar was huge and this time I took my time to sample everything. Well almost.. . Skip the asian food. Except for the rice congee. That's very good.. . Hit the roast beef and carvery station often.. . Free flow soft drinks and juice.. . I love this buffet.
I heard great things about Wicked Spoon for their brunch buffet and decided to try them out.  They are just located inside of Cosmopolitan hotel, and it can be a bit of a walk coming from the LV Blvd entrance.   Buffet is always a good choice when you have a group of indecisive bunch. . . The wait was not too bad compared to the buffets at the popular hotels on the strip.  You can add a few bucks for brunch drinks like mimosa too.  They have pretty much everything from Asian to European for brunch there, and I would even say anything you could think of in brunch would be there.  Totally wicked!  They also have plenty of dessert as well.  The service was decent too.. . Knowing Vegas, the food item will probably be different I visit them again, so until next time.
classy buffet. . glass bottles, cloth napkins, table presentation..very lovely place to eat.. I love their selections of foods.we went their for late lunch but they serve brunch so-parts of buffet is breakfast.the egg benedicts arr just PERFECT. . Each servings is in a small container or miniature parts.which is very cute and unique idea for a buffet.. Its also good for kids, people who wants to taste just a little bit of anything.But the dessert part is the most yummiest ;)
Came here on a Sunday around 11:30am. . $35 for brunch plus $12 for bottomless mimosas!. This is not a bad deal considering how AMAZING the food is. Compared to other Vegas buffets, the Wicked Spoon is definitely the best. It is clean, some of the food is served in individual portions already which is very convenient and not messy! The chefs behind the food bar are friendly and will even explain to you the fresh ingredients used for each dish. You know the food is fresh because you can see the chefs preparing the food before serving it as opposed to simply warming up prepared food in an oven!. I will definitely be back!
The restaurant and the presentation/plating of the food was very classy and pretty however the food itself wasn't that great. The food was either too bland or too salty in my opinion. Way too overpriced.
there are way better buffets in Vegas for this price or cheaper. I was expecting so much more... My expectations were washed away. The only thing I was impressed with was their Mac n cheese bar, where you could create your own Mac n cheese with different ingredients. But the guys making it were rude and were talking about some new video game, or show, or movie (idk what) the whole time. . . The service was fast with the drinks & the check. But they also kept asking me if I was done with my plate when I obviously wasn't. Why???? . . I give two stars because of the fast service, & the foods I had tasted good. That being said, I only probably ate 1/5 of the foods being served because the majority of foods sounded really weird.
Was expecting a lot based on the hype this place gets. I came here 2 years ago and they had this awesome cream of garlic soup that I remembered and looked forward to getting...wasn't there so I was a little bummed.. . The service was horrible and we were sat so close to the buffet that it was a constant stream of traffic 16 inches from where I was eating...a bit unsettling when you are trying to relax, enjoy the food and chow down.. . My favorite thing were these watermelon cubes with lime and sricacha sauce, pretty interesting.. . The most tasty dishes on the buffet are the little Italian plates they put out, but I don't usually get Italian at a buffet so it pretty much meant that I ran out of things I wanted to try...or just wasn't impressed by a lot. . . The desserts had nothing special, however, they did have the most interesting flavors of gelato I've seen...loved the thai tea gelato.. . The molton lava cake had no lava...and I love that dessert. Another bummer.. . 3 stars but ignore the buzz...also way overpriced.. . Much better options in Vegas.
What a difference a few months make! This was my favorite buffet and now it's dropped down to 2 stars! Just ate here again and a few of my favorite items are now off the menu. Gone are the high quality Godiva Red Velvet pancakes replaced by poppy seed pancakes that no one is eating.  Gone is the Wicked Pizza replaced by dry overcooked prosciutto pizza. Gone are the various small pasta dishes with short ribs replaced by wild boar.....really? Everything was bland today. The only reason I even gave this 2 stars is the gelato is still great! If they take away the Nutella or Strachatella gelato, I will not go back. I am hoping their management will read this as I have been a long time patron and see how the quality has diminished but the price remains elevated.  Please bring back the quality!!
Hands down one of the best gourmet buffets the Las Vegas valley has to offer unlimited dishes to choose from everything from breakfast to brunch they also serve a dinner after 4pm but if your looking for a top notch eating experience and delicious dishes all over the place then the wicked spoon is for you.. I've been going to there breakfast buffet for the last 2 years due to work presentations and I still enjoy every bite. The Gourmet chefs will cook serval dishes to order. I've had hand made white cheese pizzas, to egg white omelets with. Shrimp, salmon, bacon and green onions. Long story short  enjoy
They took such good care of me here! The chef walked me through the entire place to help me pick food that was both gluten and dairy free. They also made custom meals to accommodate my allergies! Custom made gluten and dairy free French toast was heavenly!
Yes it is a bit more than other buffets in Vegas but the choices you get and the quality are amazing! I loved the make your own Mac and cheese station and  salad station! They offered a goats cheese and lavender infused panna cotta as a palate cleanser which was interesting as well as watermelon chile and lime cubes!! The Dessert station was also great which several different choices that you don't usually find at other buffets. Don't forget about the gelato station!
We always go to the buffet in Bellagio and thought to change it up a bit this time. So I did a little research and was torn between this place and the new one in Caesar's Palace, because they have round the same rating and price I decided on this one due to the fact that it is closer to our hotel. WORST decision. Sure the location is a little hard to find, but that's totally fine if everything else was worth it. . Paid about $90 bucks for two people on a week day for dinner.....the selection was very very limited.... most of the items are dry, the crab legs are pitty, the desserts.....not pretty nor tasty. . Not to mention the service was horrible..... I don't tip up front, ever, even though buffets lets you. I am not sure if that was the reasosn why for the service but she definitely did not get her 10% after what happened. We ordered two cokes at first while browsing the drink menu, and ordered drinks off the happy hour ($5 drinks why not...especially with the horrible food they serve). The happy hour lasts until 7pm I think and we ordered our first drink around 6pm. When we ordered, my boyfriend ordered a mojito but asked the server if it comes in different flavors. We don't know thats why we ask, a simple yes or no would do it. But our server went above and beyond by give our a cold laugh and said "not for $5". WOW....then she managed not to come around our table to check and was totally out of sight until 6:58pm (she was fully visible as she should before we ordered anything from the happy hour) and said "do you guys want another drink? I think I can still do it for you" like shes doing us a favor. Nice isn't she?
pricing was $41. . . thought there would be more of a selection but overall it's okay. Go to bachannal if you can
I had been looking forward to this indulgence-my first Vegas buffet. We did brunch on Saturday for about $35/person. The chocolate covered strawberries alone made it worth every penny. . . I'm a carb-lover so buffets are usually a waste for me, but wicked spoon had lots of choices for a picky eater like me. Highlights include wild mushroom carbonara, gnocchi, Korean mochi, saffron risotto, and angry Mac and cheese. I loved it all. . . I was impressed to see Hamachi nigiri on the buffet, until I tried it. The rice was way too mushy. The cream of mushroom soup was good, a little on the rich side but good. Of course I had to try the famous bone marrow. That was surprisingly good too. . . Desserts were good while simultaneously being disappointing. The chocolate covered strawberries stole the show. The other desserts not so much. Raspberry rice crispy squares not so hot. The coffee tort was meh. The cheesecake was just average. The other complaint I have is they give you pre-warmed plates, which melt the chocolate! Then all the chocolate cracks off the strawberry! Not the best idea. I grabbed a cold plate from another dessert for my strawberries.
