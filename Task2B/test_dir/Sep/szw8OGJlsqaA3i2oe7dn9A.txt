For my birthday had them deliver 4 pastries to my room to share with my friends and they where all A++
Located close to the elevators at the aria casino. A nice place to relax with your favorite pastry, coffee, or crepe. Or just cool and people watch. The chicken crepe was on, the chicken was dry, but the filling made up for it. The menu is slightly over priced for the quality. I expected better, but probably crepe in not their specialty. I prefer the crepe at Paris casino.
The best french pastries I've ever had. I went here twice for breakfast during my stay at the Aria since everything looked so good. It does get very crowded in the morning's, but it's worth the wait. I tried the ham and cheese croissant, which was amazing. The bechemel sauce makes this dish. I also had the pain au chocolat, which was really rich and filling. On the last day, I had to try one of the cakes, so we tried the nutella napolean. It might be one of the best things I've ever tried. The filling was creamy and the crust perfectly flaky and chocolatey. I would go back and have this again if I could. It was very filling, so even though I had maybe two-third's, I was stuffed.
Holy Crap, can I just move in here?. . Stayed at the Aria for a few nights and needed a light breakfast. The patisserie is right next to the guest room elevators so it was quite and convenient and I decided to give it a try. . . I ordered the ham and cheese croissant which was hands down the best ham and cheese croissant I have ever had. I also had to get something called the Chocolate Intense. Wow! Just wow! It was amazing and very well named.. . Later in the day I was checking my bill at the front desk and discussed a couple of the Aria's restaurants with him. When Jean Philippe Patisserie came up he recommended the almond croissant. One guess what I had for breakfast the next day? And it was equally awesome. I also bought a muffin and cookie for the road home. Both were massively yummy.. . Also, there is plenty of seating. Considering the number of people there, I thought I would have a hard time finding a place to sit, but I quickly found a seat and despite the constant flow of people, I didn't see anyone struggle to find a seat.. . Okay, now the downside. It is a little expensive, but what do you expect, you are in a 5-star Vegas resort. The ham and cheese croissant, chocolate intense and large soda cost over $20. I had a resort credit so I didn't care. Had I not had the credit I might have docked them a star, but considering the location and how good it was, I'm not complaining.. . Also, the service leaves a little to be desired. While fast enough, they weren't friendly at all and when people asked questions they seemed more than a little put out to be answering them.. . Still, with food this good I have to give them 5 stars.
Jean Phillippe is best known pastry shop at Vegas.  The patisseries are located at Bellagio & Aria. I used to go Bellagio location, I loved their chocolate and crepes!  This is must eat items at Vegas!. . Since I stayed at Aria, it just next to the elevators to the hotel rooms.  Of coz, I wouldn't miss it.. . What a big disappointment!! We spent $30 to get crappy cakes and coffee! Just felt like just a waste of $$$$ this time!  We only ate half of it and trashed the half.. . Almond Croissant - I totally missed Thomas Hass double baked almond croissant, it fresh n warm! This one just ok.. Opera cake - So soaky and too sweet!  The worst opera cake I had at Vegas!. Tiramisu - Mediocre tiramisu! Some of Vancouver's pastry shops can make better Tiramisu than them!. Coffee - OMG! Coffee so mild even tasteless!  Starbucks coffee even better than them!. . I should only stick with chocolates and crepes next time.
This patisserie (that also has a branch at the Bellagio) is my favorite in Vegas. The nutella crepes are the best. I can also recommend the chocolate strawberries and coconut macaroons.
I have been to Jean Philippe on several occasions and think they have some of the best croissants in town. On this occasion, I came in for a crepe. The crepe area was a complete mess. The ingredients were spilled all over the place, mint was browning, and raspberries appeared mushy. I brought this to the attention of the "manager" Duke and he said that it was not up to standard but he did not try to right his wrong by offering a solution. I left empty handed. For how empty Jean Philippe was I could not believe how untidy and unappetizing the crepe station was.
Good stuff! Going to stop by this place  every time I'm in the area and also for all holidays!
Not impressed with the red velvet cupcake.  Wonder if anything else would have been better. Overpriced and too much frosting.  The people that waited on me not the friendliest people
I love all things breakfast and all things sweet so I am severely biased. . . Things you have to try! . -Almond croissant . -Ham & cheese croissant . -forest crepe. . Things you can skip.... -Chocolate croissant (very very little chocolate). -the coffee (very meh) . . Overall delicious and I visited this place 4 times over 3 days :)
I love this location in the aria rather than the bellagio . Their crepes are delicious freshly made in front of you. My all time favorite is Nutella strawberry crepe. They do charge extra for strawberry which is annoying. I have tried their savory crepes as well which are delicious too. Highly recommended.
I loved it. Everything, I loved it. But on my last day I placed an order for pastries to go and while I paid for all of them....two were missing. Tisk tisk.
After I spent a few hours at the blackjack table, I decided to go look for my friend. He texted me saying he was by the "Walking Dead" slot machines. So I went and tried to go find him.  While looking for him, I had a craving for some gelato and at Jean Phillppe they had a very good selection.  The first time I got a waffle cone with two scoops of lemon gelato. It was really good. Wonderful lemon flavor. The second time I got a waffle cone but with one scoop of cheesecake and one scoop of lemon. OMG that was so yummy! Both of those flavors along with the waffle cone went very well together. Try out that combo, I am sure its a winner winner chicken dinner! LOL
So it is not France. It is nowhere near France. I simply do not like Vegas. Have been here a dozen or so times for varies reasons and I can't stand it. But...I've grown older and my taste in food has changed. I chase Michelin star restaurants and chefs around the globe. Apparently Vegas is great for that. . . I find food that reminded me of adopted home from time to time here now. This patisserie reminded me of Eric Roy in Auxerre, near my adopted home in the same region of Burgundy. And while I don't generally care for sweets, I have my eyes set on a pain au chocolat. . . Quiche Lorraine for breakfast. Coffee to go. It beats the convention center conference food. Must endure the gambling crowd while standing in line for your quiche to be heated up. Think this would be a much less expensive flight than to Charles De Gaulle. . . Don't miss.
