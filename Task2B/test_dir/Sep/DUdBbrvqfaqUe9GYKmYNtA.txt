Stayed here for 3 days over Labor Day weekend. We have had a really great time with excellent service. The pools here are fantastic. Great bars. Cravings is a great buffet. The only reason I gave it 3 stars and not 4 is bc the dolphin exhibit made me really sad. Location is great and close proximity to a lot.
Beautiful hotel, but the staff was so unhelpful! Why weren't we told at check-in about the M Life card that gave us discounts to most of the hotel's services not to mention the Beatles Love Show? How about the inter-hotel monorail? Would have been nice to know about it before we walked in 106 degree weather to see the sights all week. Either the staff is not well trained or just simply don't know guest perks themselves. Ridiculous.
Stayed here with some friends over Labor Day weekend for three nights. Overall, it was a nice hotel.. . Pros:. Room service provided very delicious breakfast.. Lighting in the bathroom was AWESOME for doing make-up. Plenty of mirrors and closet space.. Comfortable beds.. Nice View.. . Cons:. "Free" wi-fi is completely useless.. When we ordered room service (which we did several times) we'd call to have them pick up the trays outside, which they wouldn't do for several several hours.. Housekeepers tended to enter the room without knocking first.. . I enjoyed my stay here very much, but having NO wireless internet, and virtually no reception at all, my phone became useless as soon as I entered the room.
Caveat: I'm an Aria sort of girl...any time I stay at another hotel in Vegas, I end up comparing it to the Aria. . . I had low expectations for the Mirage, and I must admit that they were exceeded. . . The rooms are nice--not too small, well furnished, reasonably modern. And the nightstand drawer handles are perfect bottle openers!. . My only complaints:. -No outlets near the bed (this is 2014, people). -No sound insulation between room and hallway. . In a perfect world, every Vegas hotel room would have a button, a la Aria, that turns off all the lights and closes the black out curtain with one fell press. I guess I can't really fault the Mirage for not having that, though.. . The pool is nice, and there are decent food options. I could stay here again!
Great location on the strip. Hadn't stayed here in 17 years but the rooms are still really nice. They've kept them updated and clean. Feels smaller than most Vegas resorts which is nice.. On another note, I am completely against the fact they have a dolphin show on the hotel premises! How can they keep these poor beautiful creatures captive. They really should watch the documentary The Cove and see what industry they are supporting. Because of this I refuse to stay there again until they remove this "attraction" or so they call it.
Not bad not Amazing either... Very basic hotel. Crowd is....... After I got home I got random charges on my credit card and when I called to tell them they said they can't help and if I want I can dispute the charges.
This was my first visit to Vegas and it was amazing! I hardly ever write reviews but, as I enjoyed my stay at The Mirage, I knew I had to!. . I went during Labor Day weekend and arrived on a Saturday night. Checking in was quick and easy. Our rooms were ready and it had a nice view overlooking the pool. . Every place we went inside the hotel was exceptional. From the hotel staff to the staff in every restaurant and store; the service was great! I was amazed at how nice they were (maybe that's the New Yorker in me... idk). Also the food at BLT Burger and Stack was amazing as well. One of the best burgers and steakhouses I've been too. I actually went to BLT Burger 3 times during my stay. Samba House was good, not great but, that could of been because I ordered the all you can eat and after the first few meats, I started to feel sick. However, the service was one of the best I've experienced. . You can pass on Cravings Buffet... only the orange juice and coffee were good. Didn't care for the breakfast and didn't even bother trying the lunch. . 1 Oak is a fun club to go to on nights were you don't want to leave the hotel and the lobby bar is great too. . Check out was extremely quick... I received an email, looked over my charges to make sure everything was accurate and clicked check out. As you walk out the elevators in the lobby, they have a mailbox to drop your room key in. I didn't have to wait on line or anything. It was the quickest and easiest checkout and I didn't have to talk to anyone!. I went with a friend however, this hotel is very family orientated. It seemed to have more families than single groups.  . . The cons:. 1. You pay for the wifi (it's apart of the resort fee) however it never worked. And don't  bother calling the front desk for help with it either. I did have 3G on my phone however, it would take forever to load and sometimes not at all.. 2. No outlets by the bed which to me is odd but, it is an old hotel. . 3. The room key worked when it wanted... if I went into my room and the key worked the first time around, it was a miracle! . . Overall I had a blast in Vegas and the cons weren't bad enough to make me feel otherwise. The pros at The Mirage definitely outweigh the cons: great food, staff, service, and checkout. The only reason why I wouldn't stay in The Mirage the next time around would be because I rather be closer to the center of the strip.
The last time I was there was maybe 4-5 years ago to watch LOVE.  I noticed that the casino floor had a make over.  So based on the pictures, I decided to book this over TI.  I was not very happy with the look and feel of TI when I was there 3-4 years ago.  . I have to say that I was a bit surprised with the hallway and look of the room.  Even though our view is of the freeway and rooftops, the room itself was nicely renovated.  Enough room and nice queen sized beds to top it off.  . I do have a few complaints I'd like to list here for others to take into account when deciding to stay here.  The bathroom is on the small side for a Resort of this nature.  Would have liked to have a bigger bathroom and not have to worry about touching the toilet bowl when coming out of the shower.  Don't need to have to wash myself again when I just did so.  . Others have mentioned that the wireless here sucks and they are absolutely right.  I was getting less than 1mbps and most of the time was like .10mbps.  That's pretty bad for a 4-5 star resort.  Why are we paying a $25 resort fee when most people don't use the pool, fitness center or can't use the internet.  A word of warning.  If you have AT&T and are on the side facing the freeway, you are not going to be very happy.  But I have found at times that using my cellular worked better than the wifi.  Verizon users on the other hand should be getting about 16mbps according to my speediest.  . The last complaint is the TV.  According to their channel guide, there are HD channels.  I don't know who configured these TV's but the HD channels were not HD at all.  It felt like I was in a cheap motel as most of their TV's suck.  To top it all off, I had to be careful where I stood in the room as the TV would lose signal when I stood in certain spots.  From the looks of things, it looks like the TV is running off of rabbit ears instead of cable.  I didn't make any complaints as it would have been pointless and management wouldn't have done anything to remedy the issue.  . The best thing about this hotel however, it that it's pretty centralized to Ceasar's, Venetian & Wynn.  The casino floor is pretty nice also.  There always seem to be people around, but not overly crowded.  I didn't have a hard time finding an open slot machine or finding a spot at the craps table.  I did like that the craps table was $5 during the day.  I would consider staying here next time.
This was our first visit to this hotel but our 6th visit to Las Vegas.. . We chose this hotel based on price (great deal on retailmenot.com) and what the pool looked like since we knew MOST of our time during the day would be in the water.. . The Staff:. Our check in was very easy and since we were there celebrating our anniversary, they allows us to check out at 3pm and waived the $30 late checkout fee. Unfortuantly for us, that was all they could do since we had already paid the hotel in full. . The Bell hop was also very gracious and helpful with keeping our bags safe and hailing a taxi out front for us.. . The Room:. We "upgraded" for only $25/day to a Resort Tower King room which promised a strip view and a few extras we were sure to use. The 'strip view' wasn't straight out of our window and technically we had to crank our necks to the left so that wasn't worth it. What was nice is that these rooms included private elevators to the 24th and 25th floors, spacious bathrooms, dual sink vanity, soaking tub and separate walk-in shower in the bathroom. Those upgrades were worth the splurge.. . ***We lost power in our bathroom and hour before checkout and maintenance NEVER showed, despite TWO phones calls. Very dissapointing and unacceptable .***. . The room's & pool's Wi-fi was nice to use each day and since you're FORCED to pay $25/day for it, might as well take advantage when you can.. . The Food & Drinks:. Vegas has gotten down right RUDE with their pricing. Expect to pay TWICE as much as you would back home (Seattle for us) but at least most of what we ate was really great. We have the best meals at California Pizza Kitchen and great wings at the BLT place but also had a handful of dissapointing meals. This included breakfast at the Deli and a horrible chicken caesar salad at the poolside restaurant. The next day the hubby and I shared a FANTASTIC club at the same place (super big and satifying) so go figure.. . Expect to pay $5 for a coke and $15-24 for a drink with a couple shots of the good stuff while laying poolside. Crazy to think about spending that kind of money but when it's 100 degrees outside, you'll do just about anything to cool down.. . The Pool: Waterfalls, palm trees, friendly serve staff and overall a very relaxing experience. We were VERY surprised to see the same amount of trash (bottles, cigg butts, bottle caps, food wrappers EVERY morning we were there. There is no excuse for this and they really should clean up each night after closing. Makes the place looks trashy.. . The Show:. We saw the Beatles LOVE show and it was honestly the best Cirque du Soleil show I've ever seen, hands down. The staff were very friendly helping us find our seats and chatted with us about our event before we were sat. It's a MUST see!!!
We were very pleased with our stay at the Mirage in Las Vegas.  We booked our trip through Travelocity and got a pretty good rate, complete with a $50 food/beverage credit.  We had an early flight, so we arrived in Vegas around 10am.  Check in is 3pm. Oh no.  Well, turns out The Mirage rocks.  I went to the front desk to ask if they may hold our bags until check in, that way we wouldn't have to lug our luggage around.  She did better than that, she said our room was already ready to go.  Sweet! The woman that helped us was so nice! Great first impression. I will note that you will have a $200 deposit.. no matter what.  We found it strange since our room was already fully paid for months in advance, but oh well.  Resort fees are about $30, which is standard at any hotel on the strip. Our room was gorgeous, we had a strip view and we were on the 22nd floor.  The view was so nice, especially at night.  The decor was very modern, and the room was comfortable.  No complaints.  The walls were a bit thin as we could hear people conversing outside, but it wasn't to the level of bothersome. The bathroom came complete with shampoo, conditioner, face wash, body wash.. yay! Oh, and skip the mini-bar! Unless you want to pay $6 for a water bottle.. . The reason I'm giving a 4 star instead of 5 is because of the hotel itself.  I noticed that the casino in the Mirage was quite smokier than some of the other casinos we visited, but I guess that's just something you have to accept in Vegas.  The pool at the Mirage is also FREEZING! I should have had my husband film me as I got in, because that was the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge right there! This was in August, so it was a scorcher out.  Yet nobody was in the pool, except a few kids of course.  Kids don't seem to feel cold. Weirdos.  Also, I'm not a fan of the dining options in the hotel.  I noticed that other hotels such as the Venetian, Caesar's, Flamingo, etc.. all had food courts.  The Mirage has no such thing. This makes for pricier meals or having to walk off property to grab a bite.. . Overall, the central location of The Mirage is fantastic.  I would definitely consider staying here again.  Now if you guys could turn the temperature up on the pool, I'd be forever grateful!
I used to love the Mirage when I was younger, but my past experience has definitely turned me away as a guest.. . - Arrived at the hotel at around 10 pm. They didn't have the room we had booked available (Resort Tower King), they only had Resort Queen rooms available.  A little annoying since the Resort Tower King is a slight upgrade from Resort Rooms, but it's late and I understand.  They let us know they'll move us tomorrow at noon, and they'll call us to let us know what room we've been transferred to.  No need to return the keys, he says, because they can just change which room the keys open on the computer. Awesome.. . - Next day at 11 am, we call to confirm the transfer.  What transfer?  After some searching, they still can't find any records of a transfer request.  Would we like to initiate one? Um, yes. To a room we originally booked.  Thanks.  Okay, they say.  Hold tight.  We'll call back in a minute.. . - No word for half an hour.  Wecall back.  They're still working on it.  Hold tight, they say.. . - No word after an hour.  We're literally just sitting by the room phone with all of our packed luggage just watching TV, since we can't go gambling or anything.. . -Two hours later: congrats! The room has been transferred! Come down to the lobby for your new keys! Um.. but the guy said you could just do that on the computer. No? Okay, we'll go down.. . - Get to the lobby with all of our luggage in tow.  Your keys? Oh, they've been sent up with security to meet you in front of your new room.  Didn't anyone tell you?. . And even after all this, I was still charged the FULL AMOUNT for the upgraded room.  Complained to the front desk, complained to a manager... nothing.  Are you freaking kidding me?  Get your crap together, Mirage.. . All in all, even though it's a decent hotel, it's honestly a little pricey for being so basic.  There are a lot of nicer hotels for similar prices and a bigger casino floor, so I'm not entirely sure what the Mirage's appeal is supposed to be. Maybe the location?  I'm not too sure, but you'd better believe that I will be enjoying my stay somewhere a bit more organized, thank you.
This old girl is showing her age.  I remember this hotel being built and it was absolutely beautiful.  Comparable to Ceaser's.  Not anymore.. . The Volcano show is still good, but that's the main attraction.. . We will choose another hotel int he future.
I wasn't impressed.  The carpets and counters in my room were really dusty and dirty. Plus my "nonsmoking" room smelled like an ashtray. No coffee pot in the room was rough!!
Here are my random thoughts about the Mirage hotel and convention center.  . . The convention center is very nice. No florescence lights for the most part. Except the chairs they use in the rooms are extremely old and everyone complained about the cushions. The guest rooms need a full remodel in the bathroom. The beds also seemed a bit tired and so did the carpet. But the rest, the TV, the linens were pretty nice.. . The pool I didn't hang out at because it was very loud. It has a pretty waterfall but very loud too. At least the rooms were very quiet so I could go back there for a rest. . . The Beatles love show is very entertaining.. . The connecting hotel treasure Island has a tram but the tram didn't start till 9 AM so that sucked for my coworker in that hotel.
Excellent show and very intimate.  They were ver appreciative of the loyal fans for the past 22 years and got involved with the audience.  I recommend seeing the show and locals get a discount:)
I hadn't been here in a few years and I missed it. I checked out of the palms hotel and went right to the mirage and it was a breath of fresh air. The staff was great, our room was ready early.  The room was beautiful, great view of the volcano. The pool staff was great. The only thing that I missed is that the pool area was smaller than I remembered and I missed seeing the lions on display. The guys at the dolphin bar Trevor and Daniel were super nice, accommodating and talked to us as we ate and drank in the pool area. I know that sounds normal, but trust me in vegas employees are busy. I would go visit them again. I appreciated them making us feel welcomed. :)
so we stayed there for 4 nights The hotel was crowded, noisy, horribly expensive (two regular sized drinks at the pool bar were $30.00 plus tip) about par for Vegas. On day 3 they closed the pool at 4:00 because they had a private event and literally asked about 200 hotel guests to pick up there stuff and leave the pool area immediately so they could get ready for the event. . So since we were in our  swim suits we decided to go to the adult pool next to the main pool. But they wouldn't let us in with out IDs  My wife had hers but since I was wearing my bathing suit I didn't have my license with me but I did have a photo of it and my passport on my cell phone. By the way I am 71 ( that's SEVENTY ONE ) years old!!! The " security guy " , a real rocket scientist said because of ATF rules a picture of my ID wouldn't do.  Now I realize I don't look a day over 65 but come on. I asked him why I could walk up to any bar in the hotel and buy a drink without an ID but not at this bar.  Duh, sorry sir those are the state rules. So from that moment I didn't spend another dime at the Mirage for anything and next year you can bet we'll spend our money elsewhere. I guess they're isn't an I Q test to work at the Mirage.  Gosh if I were getting $15 for well drinks I'd use my head. this was indicative of all the service at the hotel just awful!!
The unpleasantness started when the person driving me pulled up so I could unload my bags. The surly valet wanted us to move and they were not friendly about it.. The check in line was ridiculously long and they did not have enough staff.. Contrast to Mandalay Bay where there is a staff person near the line, helping to direct traffic and answer questions.. I asked if they had a phone charger I could borrow. (Hyatt provides this service.) I was told I could buy one.. Internet in my room was slow. Engineering brought me an ethernet cable. Mac can't use one without an adapter, which they don't have.. They offered to change my room to one with better internet, and I told the manager I could not do that until after 6pm. He said it would be fine until 8pm.. At 6:30pm, I called about the room change and was told that room changes can only happen between 11am and 4pm.. When I indicated that's not what I'd been told, they more or less said, "so sad, too bad.". . Awful customer service. Rude employees. . The only good thing to say is the room is nice. But honestly, there are much better places at the same price point.. . I'd guess they treat their employees like crap and the stuff is just flowing downhill.. . The lighting in the room is dim and the lighting in the bathroom will make you look ill when youre looking in the mirror.
Good hotel - not too pricey and great location. Not luxurious like at the Palazzo but who needs luxurious all the time?. . Front desk people were so nice, especially Sam & Milly who are both friendly, warm and welcoming.. . The rooms are nice and spacious. The beds are big and the pillows are so, tear-inducingly soft. I seriously considered stealing a pillow, they were so nice.. . Complaints: the bathrooms needed more places for you to hang your towels. It felt so wasteful to throw perfectly good towels on the floor but there was literally no place to put them. The walkways were also so windy that it was confusing trying to figure out how to get to the elevators, front desk, restaurants or out the door.
The Mirage is pretty hard to beat when it comes to bang for your buck. It has a central location on the strip and is across the street from a monorail stop (Harrah's). 1OAK is standard amongst competing Vegas nightlife, nothing to seek out unless you are into the guest host/performer(if they have one). The rooms are decorated in a modern aesthetic. The wifi included in the resort fee can be spotty in certain rooms. On my most recent stay at the Mirage I decided to finally check out the Tiger and Dolphin Habitat. The animals appeared well cared for and the place was clean. As my friend and I walked through to see the tigers we  came upon Siegfried visiting the cats. He was so warm and friendly. He spoke with us about the individual tigers and even took pictures with us. I can't say I was around for the Vegas heyday,  but I have talked Tiger with Siegfried!
We got a free night and two discounted nights at this hotel via rewards, so I can't complain too much. However, when we got to our room, I found sunflower seeds and dried corn all over the place (chairs, floor, etc.) The stopper in our tub didn't work so I wasn't able to take a bath. When we went down to tell the lobby next day, they seemed annoyed that there was an issue with the room. They begrudgingly offered to send housekeeping up and a maintenance man, but I told them I didn't want a maintenance man in the room while we were trying to relax. They only offered to change our room after I complained more. No upgrade was offered for our trouble and the staff was rather unaccommodating. Like I said, we had an inexpensive stay, so that was nice. But as far as service and cleanliness of rooms, I'd stay elsewhere. Frustrating to get off of the dirty strip and have to deal with a dirty room.
Ok so i waited a few days after my vacation to review this place so as to let everything settle in. . First off, I wanted to say that i came here having high hopes as this hotel is a staple on the Vegas strip and it came highly recommended. . . CHECK IN:. One thing to note for anyone coming here for the first time, if you arrive before 10am they do not let you check in. Other places, such as the Palazzo where I stayed the year prior, let you check in regardless of time and call you or text you when your room is ready. Mirage does not let you do this until after 10am. I did not know this and was literally waved away by the front desk clerk. Neither did she explain this to me.  She didn't seem approachable enough for me to feel comfortable to go back to and ask ANY questions.I had to call the 800 number to ask this. She was pleasant and answered all my questions.. The bell hop at the from of the hotel was unfortunately very rude to me too. I must've forgot to say thank you because he angrily and sarcastically said "you're welcome!" to me. I guess to point out the fact that i forgot to thank him. My bad for not thanking him but i was just waved away from the desk clerk and trying to figure out why. Im sure Im not the ONLY person who didn't thank him. Is he rude to EVERYONE?! I found myself apologizing to HIM! WTH! Keep in mind theses were my VERY first interactions with the staff. And based on their job positions, theses are the very first interactions most people have. I tried hard not to let this ruin my day. I kept on. . . HOTEL: . One thing you'll notice as soon as you walk in is an odd odor. Im not saying its bad as I'm sure a lot of people must like it. But its not for me, It took about the entire 3 days of my trip for me to get used to it. Its very intoxicating and really hard to take at first. Its like a punch to my face. You'll know what I'm talking about if you go visit other hotels during your stay. Theirs is a bit more subtle. A little smoky too. Other than that though, the premises are kept pretty clean. Crowd is probably a little younger than my liking. With youth usually comes a lot of rowdy behavior and late night hallway shenanigans. I was awoken a few times by this during my stay. Vegas, right?! I just didn't get awoken at other places Ive stayed at on the strip that were higher end. I guess its more normal than I thought. Gym is great (check out my review of the spa/salon). Rooms are clean and modern. Housekeepers, sweet as pie. Always kept us fully stocked.. My clock radio in the room never worked. Never called to get this replaced or fixed as to not deal with anymore staff.. Beds were a little too soft for my taste. I like soft but these were hard to sleep in. . . POOL:. Pool is huge and fun. Very lush and beautiful waterfalls. I enjoyed my time here. You have to get here early to get seats, they fill up fast. They only have about 1 waitress servicing different sections. Greats are good. Mine looked horrendous but tasted great. CAUTION: tips IS added on. Is this legal? So unless you intend to double tip, don't fork over any extra cash if you don't have to.. . OVERALL:. My overall stay here was ok. If everything during your stay goes perfectly and you don't have to deal with the staff, then you should have a very pleasant trip. If you should have the unfortunate luck that something goes wrong and you have to ask for help. GOOD LUCK!. I more than likely will not be coming back here. Would only recommend this place if you don't care about great customer service and are just looking for a place to stay. I work hard for my money and don't make much. When i finally am able to get away for a few days and decide to stay at your hotel with the many options there are, why would you want to be rude?!. I do want to give a shout out to the bell hop on the way out. Wish I knew his name. He was super nice and helpful. Too bad i couldn't have met him on day one.
Without question the front desk staff during my stay was the most courteous and professional that I have had the pleasure to deal with in the many stays I have had in Las Vegas! Of all the fine hotels I've stayed at my time at the Mirage was by far the easiest and most pleasant and it was due to your incredible staff! Well Done!
Went here for dinner at Stacks, great food! Then went to show called Love! It was Awesome!! Would recommend to see it!
