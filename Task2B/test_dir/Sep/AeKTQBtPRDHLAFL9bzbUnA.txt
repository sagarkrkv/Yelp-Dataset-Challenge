Took some friends who were in town here for dinner. The wait was only about 30 minutes so no complaints there. The sushi was good, not the best but it was decent for the price. One big problem - I GOT FOOD POISONING!. . Woke up around 4am and was very sick. I should note that no one else got food poisoning except for me, but nonetheless I have never gotten this sick after eating sushi before and I eat it quite a bit.  . . I would recommend checking out Sushi Kaya. I have never gotten sick after eating there and it is very comparable if not better.
This establishment is the sister restaurant to the Sushi Mon's in town. It is really fabulous. Not only is it delicious, it is also close to work. Also, there is a very cool vibe flowing through here. I think it's me.... . It is normally very busy. Adjust accordingly.. . Enjoy!
We have been extremely loyal customers to Goyemon for many years dining here at least 2x per month and have always praised thisplace as the best sushi house in Las vegas. Lately, not so much anymore. We have noticed since Gio no longer works here that there may have been some kind of employee shake up. The morale now seems depressed and it really shows on some of the front of house employees. Tonight I was totally disgusted with the hostess and the Japanese female server with glasses. We were not greeted by a friendly hostess, and the server was not friendly either. She took our initial order and never came back until I had to ask if we could order more food. This is an AYCE sushi house! Or isn't it? When she took our second round of orders it was like we were disgusting her and it wasn't much. She did not even refill our water cups or drinks. Soon after we finished our first round of food, the hostess asked if we were all done? Really?. We were sitting there looking around and never saw this place with so many open tables. Maybe people caught on faster than we did. Service has gone severely downhill. Warning to the owner, there's a lot of competition out there.. We sure miss Gio. We walked in, he knew our beverages and always came to say hello. He made everyone feel welcome and the place had a happy aura. Not anymore.. We got into our car, drove off and we all sadly said, I don't care to come back anymore. Sad. I hope you can repair the great reputation you once had.  . Sincerely,. A new loyal customer to Soho Japanese restaurant on Jones/Warm Springs.
Its used to be good but not anymore. Service is rude. U will be asked to leave almost after u pay, seriously! I see that they are busy but its unacceptable. The quality of food is going down hill! Oh and all of the hosts are extremely rude!
This is definitely my go-to spot before I leave Vegas. $21.95 for AYCE at lunch?! What a steal!!! Everything is fresh and they don't pile on the rice on the sushi! It still is a little more than most places in LA but I'm not complaining.. . What I Recommend. - ALL THE DESSERTS! Seriously, we ordered 1 of everything. Sooo good!. - Sashimi Salad. - Supreme Salmon Roll. - Tiger Roll. - J.J. Roll. - Salmon Sushi. . I highly recommend the Lychee Sorbet!! It was refreshing and had lychee bits in it! They go a little heavy handed on the crab meat sometimes on the Sashimi Salad but it was really good overall! I love salmon so Supreme Salmon was my kind of roll! The J.J. Roll is heavy but soooo worth it. . . TIP: No Uni or Ebi for lunch. You would have to pay the dinner price of $26.95 instead.. This place is always crowded on the weekends so try going at an off time or make reservations!
With so many delicious restaurants on the Strip, I usually don't take the initiative to venture out and explore other restaurants off of it.  But, since trying Sushi House Goyemon, I realized I've been missing out.  . . Now, let me tell you.  This place is truly one of the best sushi places I've ever been to.  I mean it's hard to imagine that at a city like Las Vegas where Sand and Cactus Trees predominate, you'd find a place like Goyemon that offers its patrons one of the freshest sashimi they ever experienced. . . So, a group of my friends came here for dinner on a Thursday night.  We all signed up for the AYCE dinner special, which was a little less than $30.  My friends mostly ordered the Special Rolls, but I stuck with Nigiri.  I really enjoyed Goyemon's Garlic Tuna along with the Sweet Shrimp (too bad it's only one order per person).  I still got to try some of the special rolls that my friends ordered, and they too hit the spot.. . In conclusion, I'll definitely come here next time I'm in Vegas, or will make an attempt at the other restaurants off the Strip.  Heard Lotus of Siam is also a must go to place...
My husband and I came here for lunch at noon and wow, it was already starting to get busy. . . The hostess had a bad attitude, Which i hope she didn't have the whole time she was working. We got seated right before the lunch rush came in at a nice small intimate table.. . We orded some a variety or Sushi-Nigiri, which i felt were TINY but the fish tasted fresh. We also ordered some rolls which came out in good timing.and for the most part i remembered all of them being pretty good. . . The one roll that i actually rememered ordering was the 911 Roll, and they were not lying, that stuff is SPICY!. . Service was decent as well, our server came back often enough for us to order more once i plate was done.. . As for the menu. I would say this would be the perfect place for you if you like eating just rolls. They have a whole bunch of rolls to choose from. But for other plates, such as hot dishes and all that sort, not much of a selection. But sushi rolls yes.
This place has officially taken the Number 1 spot on my Top AYCE sushi restaurants. So congrats Goyemon!. . After reading reviews I knew the wait was inevitable. This place is small! Very small space. Which explains the wait time. We got there and it was about a 35 minute wait but they do grab your number and text you when your table is ready. The text even says if you need a few minutes reply back and they'll wait 2 minutes. So don't wonder too far.. . Automatically when we sit down someone takes our order. They must know the wait made us extremely famished! Ordered so many rolls (as seen in my pictures). I am a half roll kinda girl. I love getting half so I have more room to try different rolls. . . Some of my favorites were:. Sunrise Roll- This roll had cajun albacore (my fav), cucumber & avocado inside and its wrapped in tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, and white fish! I mean thats an amazing combo of fish. It taste so good! . . 911 roll- Seriously the spiciest roll out there hands down. When we got it I thought, wow what a simple roll but boy I was wrong. It's spicy tuna with habanero sauce. Now I've had sushi rolls with habanero sauce before and it was NOT as spicy as this roll. This had my mouth on fire.... but in a good way! . . Nigiri- Very fresh! The garlic tuna was to die for. And of course my favorite Cajun Albacore! . . Spider Roll- Very large roll of sushi wrapped in soy paper and not seaweed. Might need to bite it twice to finish. Very amazing flavors of the soft shell crab inside. BOMB! . . I honestly loved every single roll I tried. I wanted to keep eating but my stomach would't allow it. The presentation of the rolls and different colors of the fish used was beyond beautiful. I love when my food not only taste amazing BUT looks amazing. Even if I ordered half rolls of everything-- it looked just the same as if it was a full roll. . . service was great! Thanks for a great experience Goyemon! See you for dinner next time for that green tea cream bruele !
Best SUSHI AYCE I have every tried in my life .. this is a must try a place. Service is incredible. Food tastes amazing. Restaurant looks clean and neat. Price for dinner is 26.95 but it totally worth it. After trying this place I would never go back to any other sushi AYCE even my house is 10 miles away.
Probably my favorite sushi bar in Vegas, which happens to be one of the most popular. So, first off, be ready to wait for a table. . . Once you're in, the place is small, but well utilized to fit as many people as possible. The service is fast and accommodating. The entire place is nicely designed and edgy for an off-the-strip sushi place. . . All food has been stellar here, but I'm not a sushi snob, so it's hard for me to be disappointed. For being popular, it's quite the treat to see they offer AYCE, which I get every time.. . One of the best oddities of Sushi House Goyemon is that it's open until 3 a.m. Since I have late dinners, this is very accommodating. . . All in all, with the solid food, great hours, and ambiance makes it one of the best choice for Vegas locals.
This was my first time at ayce sushi and I got to say it was bombdizzle. For $33 dinner, i nearly passed out by our third round. However after some wiggling shifting and fresh air, I recovered and continued to go HAM on them yellow tails. This is well worth your $33 just make sure you do legs beforehand!
Sushi is my favorite meal and THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLACE EVER!!!. . . TIPS: . Come for dinner to get the good AYCE menu!! Menu encompasses one order of uni per person. It's nice that not everyone at your table needs to order AYCE. . . Came early for dinner to avoid the rush. There's not many tables inside so if you get here later, you'll be waiting a while.. . . FOOD: . Oh man. So much good nigiri!. -- YUMMY Nigiri: Tuna, Uni, Yellowtail, Salmon, Seared salmon, Albacore, Unagi, Fresh scallop aka hotate, Salmon roe aka masago (and we added quail egg on top!), Amaebi aka sweet shrimp (came with the tails, which was a little awkward to eat). They also have a specials menu written on chalkboard so make sure to check that out. We tried the salmon belly, which was a little too fatty for my taste.. -- Wasn't a big fan of the Super white tuna . . -- I didn't do any of the rolls, because I just wanted all that fresh nigiri! . . -- Hand rolls: Salmon skin roll was okay, not much flavor.. . . DESSERT: Liked the lychee sherbet. Green tea ice cream was okay, I've had (and made) better.. . . SERVICE:. Ugh. Service pretty much sucked here, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. It took foreeeeverrr to get any of our orders and sushi, and the waitresses didn't come to check on us so we had to wave and hunt them down to get more orders in. . Also, the sushi chef made one of my friend's hand rolls wrong TWICE!!! The waitress tried to argue with us until we showed her there was a shrimp inside instead of scallop. I'm really not sure how you mix up scallop and fake crab / shrimp..... . . OVERALL:. I'll be back when I'm in Vegas again! Hopefully the service was just a fluke (the waitress said one of the sushi chefs was new and so that's why it was so slow).
Amazingly good quality sushi for an all you can eat place!. . I got to Goyemon on a Monday at 8pm with a party of 3. The wait was 50 minutes. The hostess takes your phone number down and sends you a text that updates you when your table is ready. My party and I were able to wait outside until our table was ready. Although there are tables set outside of the restaurant, drinks can not be served while waiting which would have been nice! This place is quite busy and as told by the waitress my party was seated within the 50 minutes. This place is busy so if you are wanting to eat by a certain time I would plan accordingly. I assure you, it is well worth the wait.. . My top favorites on the all you can eat menu are:. 1.) The Hurricane Roll. 2.) The Lemon Roll. 3.) OID Roll. 4.) Jala Jala (like for Jalapenos). 5.) Seaweed Salad. 6.) Garlic Edamame. . I also recommend that you try the sparkling blueberry sake! . . This place was great and I plan on returning soon!
Like most I was weary of AYCE places, I'm glad I took a chance and stopped in for dinner. I was very impressed with the quality of the fish and wide selection of sushi they make. . . Must try's:. . Tiger Roll. Fried Jason . Pork Belly. Salmon Belly. . BEST MOCHI VANILLA BEAN EVER! :)
The food is still good but the service has gone bad. Our server, IRVING, sucks!!! He did not come back to our table for 15 mins even though our table is already empty. He got our drinks wrong. There are servers who weren't doing anything but stand by the back. Some of the servers who are just roaming around doing nothing didn't even ask if we wanted to order anything. Seriously?!? In a place this small and with 7 servers, service has really gone down. I think we waited total 40 - 45 mins if you add up all the times we were waiting for a server. Not coming back ever again!!!
This is my favorite sushi place ever, anywhere. The only thing I don't like about it is the wait. I brought two friends from California here once and now every time they talk about visiting, Goyemon is included in the plan. My go-to orders are garlic edamame, salmon belly, the Japanese Lasagna roll, and tempura ice cream.
As I write this, I'm really struggling on what to rate it. Somewhere between 4 and 5 stars.. . The service we experienced was brash, but to be expected of an all-you-can-eat place.  But there in lies, my dilemma.  Coming here, I was under the impression that it was in fact, a buffet.  I was wrong.  What I experienced was an all-you-can-eat-a la carte place.. . So, basically you order and they make your sushi to order. Because of this, the quality of the fish, and rice is higher than any other all-you-can-eat sushi joints I've been to (though, I tend to avoid these at all costs).  But, due to the fact that it's all-you-can-eat their product is just not up to par with sit down joints (also, I have been very spoiled in my raw fish experiences). . I think I'm going to rate them on being an al a carte place, and give them 3 stars... It was good, but not special.  That's not to take anything away from them, as, previously state - probably the best all-you-can-eat sushi I've had...
Goyemon's service definitely needs work. Saturday around 4:30 and they are slow as molasses even with a packed restaurant. . . The quality of fish has seriously gone down and well the bad service just makes it bad overall. At 430 there's a wait and you would expect it to be amazing AYCE with the wait. The scallop is drenched in lemon juice, the yellowtail was poorly cut, etc etc. . . . Overall really disappointed by the quality. I won't be back for a long while.. . PS. I was in the bathroom for the rest of the night after that. =\ I know that's one of the risks of AYCE sushi though.
Why is it that the more Las Vegas gets over saturated with AYCE sushi restaurants the more the service and quality go out the window? I don't understand how a place with this many good reviews could miss the mark so far. . . My friend and I sat at the sushi bar. First off the sushi chef was very rude. He had a bad attitude and was not attentive at all. We had to get his attention several times though he was maybe two feet away. The chef snapped at my friend when he mentioned that we ordered amaebi instead of ebi which we were served. The chef kept saying you can't get amaebi with AYCE. We both agreed a few times that its ok we will pay for it on the side for the regular order with our AYCE. It was very annoying and frustrating. It was such an awkward meal. I guess that was it for the chef. From that point on everything we ordered was either incorrect or lacked something. I know sushi pretty well. I have been a fan since I was 9, I worked at a sushi restaurant for a long time and learned a lot about it and my friend with me is Japanese. I will say the big eye tuna is tasty! This place just really disappointed me. Not only the yelp reviews excited me but my friends have told me so many great things about Goyemon. Maybe I will have to give them another try.
5 stars!! Best sushi off the strip. 3 reasons.... . 1) All you can eat!!. 2) nigiri isn't overwhelmed with rice. The fish is very fresh and cut perfectly. The piece of fish is actually bigger than the rice.. 3) pork belly, melts in your mouth. Seaweed salad is delicious (different than most restaurants, awesome seasoning added). . If you're daring, take a shot of ponzu with quail egg . . My only issue would be that the place is really small so you'll definitely be on a wait. But it's so worth it! I've been to this place 5 times since I first discovered it. Definitely my new favorite spot.
I had almost given up on all you can eat sushi because generally the quality is sacrificed greatly.  However my boyfriend eats so darn much that I had to keep searching.  We had come to goyemon a long time ago when I was super hungry and opted out while everyone gorged themselves, but this time I was armed with intense hunger.  I like that the nigiri  are not so inundated with rice that they overwhelm the fish.  The garlic tuna was super fresh and had an awesome light sauce which I believe was elevated with some yuzu.  The ikura was freaking awesome, fresh and perfect seasoned which is hard to find.  I also loved some baked green muscles the sauce was so yummy and not bland like some places, and the muscles were not to big.  I prefer smaller sized because the bigger ones can get a bit chewy.  I like that you can order half rolls and that they have more unique desserts like chocolate mousse and green tea creme brule.  The green tea creme brule could have used more of a firm sugar top is was more speckled that a layer of crunchyness.  The chocolate mousse was the perfect size for how rich it was.  I did notice some of the cuts of fish got a little less consistent towards the very end......we ordered a lot for two people.  Our server kept up with us pretty awesome for how busy it was, and the food came out very quickly.  So for being an all you can eat place I believe they earned 5 stars.
Well... I would say the food was good but it didn't "wow" me. Since I've been trying most of all you can eat sushi all over Vegas. I pretty have my favorites! I would point out lunch all you can eat is $21.50 (something! Make that $22) while dinner is $27. I have goyemon 3 STARS :) . . Oh and the service was great! Very approachable and friendly environment
Located near my office this happens to be a regular lunch time take out place for my office. They haven't been consistently great for lunch with dry chicken occasionally & my crispy rice has been over done but for dinner they have been great. I hope they get it together for lunch because we would appreciate it :). As for dinner, there have been many evenings that the wait has been over an hour & our group had to move on to another option. The all you can eat options are great & you can order half rolls which I love because I enjoy tasting a little bit of everything. . Come hungry so you can chow down.
The rolls are cut in different sizes, some being too small, leaving other pieces larger than comfortable to eat. The garlic edamame had too much butter on them. The yellowtail tasted strange but the tuna was the saving grace. The spicy tuna in several rolls was overly salty. . . The service tho was spot on, bussers and servers alike were attentive and very nice.
Top 5 sushi places I've been to.  I'm NOT a fan of AYCE places, especially sushi cause it's usually subpar in quality.  This place has amazing sushi that's quality and affordable.  The best are the garlic tuna nigiri, the crispy rice cracker, and hurricane (got it twice!).  The shrimp tempura, mussels, and green tea creme brulee are also standouts.  Oh, and a warning, the 9-1-1 roll really is SUPER spicy!  Believe them when they warn you not to order it if you can't handle spicy.... phew, sweating just thinking about it.
Small place, but good service and food!  I think I only counted 10 tables here plus a bar.  I came in by myself and sat at the bar, did not opt for the AYCE.  I would def come back by myself, but it looks like the wait is forever for a table.  Which is a good sign of the food, I suppose.
I think I found my all-time fave AYCE sushi bar! Came here on a Thursday evening around 8pm after I weighed-in for my kickboxing fight. Naturally, I had an appetite since I had been cutting weight for almost an entire week! I was in a party 3 and we had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. I can only imagine - and I'm pretty sure this place is packed on the weekends. Service is prompt and professional. The AYCE menu includes the typical nigiri and variety of rolls. They also offer 1 order/person of sweet shrimp and uni. The wagyu beef and pork were also on the menu and are definite "must-haves!" The volcano roll was delicious! Make sure you save room for dessert because that's AYCE, too! Yep, AYCE mochi, tempura ice cream and other sweet treats to choose from! Definitely check this place out before you hit the Las Vegas buffets. You'll leave pleasantly surprised and satiated :)
BEST sushi place I've been to. ALL you can eat, the quality is top notch, and I love the size of the nigiri.  You get to sample so many different types.  The service is quick and friendly, and the deserts are TOO good. Green Tea Crembruleeee is so delicious, and their special Yuja Sorbert was very tasty.  I try to come here every time I visit, and I never leave unhappy.  Definitely quality sushi for a great price. I think they lose money when I come here with my family because of the amount we can eat!
