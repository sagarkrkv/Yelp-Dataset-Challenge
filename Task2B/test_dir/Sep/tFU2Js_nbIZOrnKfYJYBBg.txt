Good Dinner, Better Brunch. . Okay, for brunch, I would give the restaurant five stars.  But the dining experience is all about dinner for me.  Let's face it, breakfast is easy.  Dinner was just okay at Buchon.  The service was strange.  I can't say that it was rude, just very informal.  I will not be returning again for dinner, but I will be back for brunch!
quick tip:  restaurant tucked away to the right of the registration desk at the lobby - not towards the interior of the casino.. . eurostyle breakfast executed on par.  we had omelette du jour, and french toast.. . decent friendly service, the ambience on the outside patio was calming and not too crowded.  pricing was fair - didn't feel like I was getting ripped off.
Breakfast was excellent , food was perfect in Vegas as it was in Chicago....will always return whenever in the area again
Had dinner with my wife here last week. Was very excited to try it.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed.  We ordered raw oysters which were very small with no flavor and slightly fishy.  Then mussels which were very fishy.  Then escargot, which were old. The waiter was OK but never asked how our meal was otherwise I would have told him. I live on an island and eat seafood all the time so I know how it should taste. The formage plate was good and the horseradish was the best I've ever has. That's the 2 stars
Back again! This is a must stop for Brunch. You can relax and enjoy a goid meal with a group or just by youself.  The layout, service and food are all on point but you must like pastries oand bread.  My choice is Petit Dejeuner Americaine with Cheese Danish. Great deal for $22.00 plus tip   . Sit inside by a Window if you can and on your 2nd trip sit outside.  . . If you want something a bit richer try the French Toast.. For an afternoon snack try the lemon Tart or a cheese danish to go.
We headed to Bouchon. This is Thomas Keller's place (of the French Laundry fame in Napa Valley) in the Venetian Hotel, and one of the places I sought out and made a reservation for prior to coming. I have learned that it depends on when you ask someone about their dinner in order to get a valuable answer. Never ask right after - too intoxicated in a good way or too tired/grumpy/intoxicated in a bad way. Asking either Mr. V or myself that night how it was, overall, and we would've advised disappointed. Ask us the following day or even two days later, and my answer changes to good and his to meh. . . Immediately, I liked the atmosphere and the layout of the restaurant. We had the option of sitting outside, which Mr. V vetoed because he didn't want to be distracted by the dozens of walking peoples, which I understood. Aside from the fine white linens, a majority of the restaurant was laid out in exposed cherry and walnut wood. The bar, the tables, the ceiling, the dividers were all exposed wood and gleaming. The ceilings were tall, but there wasn't much draft, which was nice, considering I was wearing very little. . . I ordered a house glass of wine and a half dozen oysters, which turned out to be some of the best oysters I've had in a long time. They were so fresh and gritty, full of salt water and so very briny. It was lovely. Even Mr. V thought so. As I sit and think, I probably could've made a meal out of them, and happily, alongside my house wine. . . The tomato salad with ricotta was delish. It had three thick slices of heirloom tomatoes - red, orange, and yellow- and a soft grating of ricotta drizzled on top of some red bibb lettuce, all the while lying in a pool of freshly minced pesto. It really was yummy. I like having to cut my tomatoes with a steak knife and wiping up leftover pesto with the freshly baked bread. The tomatoes has such a smell that it was like they were picked hours earlier (and quite possibly were), sitting and warming in a kitchen ready to serve hundreds of people. . . My entree was bouillabaisse - which had a pinkish broth. I'm still waiting for that moment when bouillabaisse comes in a clear or white broth, as it's supposed to originally, but this one was the closest I had ever gotten. Wish there was more broth, though. I love myself broth, so the more the merrier. The seafood bits were nicely cooked, and not one was overdone, which is a feat within itself for a kitchen - especially when the food will sit and cook at the table as well. I loved the head-on prawn.. . Mr. V ordered roasted chicken - now, inside, I was scornful because it's bleeping chicken. I avoid chicken or turkey as much as humanly possible, mostly because the birds are just not flavorful. And Mr. Thomas Keller, maybe your chicken is notch, but alas, chicken is chicken is chicken. It was half a chicken, which meant that Mr. V had to eat it slowly to avoid mess on his shirt, but he still liked it and finished it anyway. . . I would go back - but probably more so for the wine and oysters than anything.
I would say that my experience was somewhat disappointing. It's not bad, just not Thomas Keller quality. . . The atmosphere of this place is just swanky. Glossy tile, brass, and wood. That's my favorite part!. . Came here for brunch yesterday by myself and sat at the bar. Bar was more interested in opening than acknowledging me, and the rest of my experience came across this way, save one of the girls that refilled my coffee (which is really great coffee, by the way.. . Ordered the Croque Madame as everyone suggested. I'm confused why everyone adores it so much. It's a $19 grilled cheese with an egg on top with some nice, crisp frites.. It was burned around the edges (not toasted... Downright charred), and the bartender tried justifying it as "well done." It was good, not great. . . I would come back here though for dinner to give them a solid college try. The atmosphere is whimsical and great, and sitting on the patio is a great idea.
Good quality ingredients with good size portions ( not like the small french portions at other french restaurants I've been to. The foe Gras was really good and smoked salmon delish!! Highly recommend.
Food: delicious . I had their croque to Madame. And thought it was amazing. The rest of my table did too. They all wanted to try it. All 6 of them...leaving me mostly without a sandwhich :(. Service: Las Vegas is where my friends and I meet every year. We all live in various parts of the country so when we see each other we want to catch up. Friday night is conducive to this. What with all the drinking dancing and craziness. So we had brunch here and stayed for 3 hours catching up. No one complained and they kept pouring our waters which we needed after our Friday night.. . So I love this place.. Also their butter is made there and is extremely delicious!
Thomas Keller once again proves he can indeed do French cuisine and do it well. Wonderful wine list, cuisine to die for and exceptional service. A must try when in Vegas. Thanks Andy. La grande bouffon.
Had the brunch and felt like there wasnt much savoury dishes to choose from. The cod was fabulous though, really recommend everyone try it out. The french toast was overly sweet and soggy. The strawberry waffle was crispy and nice. The restaurant is clean and spacious. The choice to sit inside/outside is a nice change. This place is ok in my opinion.
I came here with a group of 5 girls for Brunch this past weekend. First thing is, the place is beautiful. I have never left the 1st floor of the Venetian hotel before so it was a nice surprise going up to the 10th floor. They have outside seating but we opted for inside seating. . We got 4 plates to share between the 5 girls and i'm really glad we did, the portions were pretty big. We didnt even finish everything. I really enjoyed the white sausage, it was a mix of pork, veal and chicken. Lots of flavor there and very jiucy...hm..... The rest of the food was great too, but I think my favorite was the regular croissant pastry! Just tasted so fresh. I would come back for the other pastries.. Service was great too, our waitor explained the entrees to us and he was very patient and attentive to our needs.
I took my friend here for an early birthday dinner during restaurant week, . the restaurant was not packed at all and they still had plenty of seating available at a 5pm on a Friday night. . . I made reservations but it wasn't necessary since they had so much spaces, we ended up getting outdoor seating which is a must !! if you are coming here because the view outside is gorgeous and helps you get away from the craziness and fanaticism of Vegas.  There are fountains outside with lots of foliage, and tons of lounging area as well. . . We decided to forgo the restaurant week menu since it didn't seem to have anything special nor worth getting compared to the regular menu. . . We ended up ordering the escargots a la bourguignonne, croque madame with truffle fries!! MUST GET TRUFFLE FRIES, its worth the surcharge of $11. . My friend ordered the pan seared trout with sliced almonds and green beans, which was delicious and oh so tender. . . You have to save the butter garlic sauce to dip the bread in after eating the escargots, I would purchase this sauce if they sold it because that's how good it is.  The croque madame is the best croque madame I have ever had, however I haven't had a croque madame since French class in 5th grade, but this croque madame was pretty freaking good.  The runny egg has got to be the best part. . I wasn't able to finish the fries or even half of my sandwich, so I took it home and my brother ended up eating it . sad day. . . Will come back to try their brunch!!
One of my favorite restaurants on the strip. Everything on the menu is amazing. Brunch is good but for the full experience, go for dinner. Request Kelly as your waitress. You will not be disappointed
If you love yourself, please order the strip steak.
Another Vegas trip, another visit to Bouchon.. . Thewife and I came to Vegas last week to celebrate our anniversary.  We needed somewhere to go for dinner one of the nights and we defaulted to our old standby, Bouchon.  I wanted to go somewhere new but couldn't really decide so we just decided to go to Bouchon since that was a safe choice.  Boy am I glad we did.. . It was a Tuesday night and we had reservations.  We were seated immediately in the upper area of the restaurant, (the left side above the lower area by the pool).  I don't know if it was just a slow night or they had us up there because it was our anniversary but we had the whole upper area to ourselves.  It was very nice.  The waiter Daniel came over and started chatting and then the manager came by with 2 glasses of champagne.  Nice touch.  Daniel was very knowledgable and friendly.  I noticed that they were serving a Lamb Sirloin special that night and I love lamb.  I asked the manager about it and he described to me and it sounded great.  I asked Daniel about it and he said, "I don't know why but they're pan searing it for some reason.  I think it's better grilled."  I agreed with him and asked if they could grill it instead and he said, "of course.". . We started off with the zuchinni blossom appetizer and the wife had a tomato salad that she really enjoyed.  The zucchini was incredible salty fried goodness.  Certainly not healthy but oh so good.. . The lamb sirloin with cippolini onions, fingerling potatoes and escarole was sublime.  . . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?select=xpMDTgaqauAVJESLOKanwg&userid=z8ie74vdxx-28KPHA5EVlg#xpMDTgaqauAVJESLOKanwg. . The wife had trout almandine.  She had a few pin bones but overall liked the dish.. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?select=Ajn0wRJMIJzDfgM3MEnROA&userid=z8ie74vdxx-28KPHA5EVlg#Ajn0wRJMIJzDfgM3MEnROA. . For dessert we had opera cake.  The cake was very good but there was some sort of light brown sauce on the plate that for some reason my brain was processing as tasting like garlic.  It was a very strange sensation.  After I figured out what was giving me that taste I just avoided that sauce.  . . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?select=eTcq_5bEXwcJj-C9_s6bFA#eTcq_5bEXwcJj-C9_s6bFA. . When we ordered dessert the wife ordered a latte.  When Daniel asked what I would like I declined as I don't like coffee.  He was surprised and when I explained to him that I just don't like the taste of coffee he said, "I'm going to bring you something."  I told him OK but I'm not going to like it.  He brought me an espresso martini and it was indeed very good.  He was right I actually liked it.. . We have been to the Vegas and Napa Bouchon's many times but this dinner was the best experience we've ever had at Bouchon.  The food was amazing and Daniel is a fantastic server.  He made the experience truly special.
omg first time i got the leg of lamb do moist and packed with flavor.. and also ordered the petite seafood platter amazing... . . lamb and seafood perfext combo. . great service too
Had a lovely weekday brunch here.  Sat outside where the courtyard setting is quite pleasant.  Ordered pan au chocolat (pastries are to die for) and the corned beef hash (solid, not crazy amazing).  Should have ordered the croque Madame (saw a couple of those bad boys pass by ... Looked amazing).  Service was excellent.
I've been here a few times already and every time is as good as the last. I always order the foie gras for appetizer and it is unbelievably deliciois. Had the Steak Frites medium rare and it was cooked perfecrly. I love the consistency and quality of this place. Can't wait to go again.
I've dined at Bouchon a handful of times over the years. Half the time it's been pleasant and half the time it's been just "meh." Sometimes the food is good but service is subpar or other times service is excellent and food just doesn't cut it.. . I am rating this with my most current experience in mind. We arrived at about 6pm with no reservation. They were kind enough to make a table available for us outside near the pool. The servers were very attentive and our waitress thoroughly went over the specials as well as her menu favorites.  I appreciated the fact that she let us take our time and answered all of our questions. . . What we ordered: . . Deviled Eggs ($5) deliciously simple, can't really go wrong with deviled eggs. Just enough mayo with the egg yolk.. . Steak and frites ($37) server was kind enough to help us split this since we were sharing. She indicated that the steak was typically served medium. I wanted medium rare, my dining partner wanted medium well, we compromised and got it medium. Definitely way too well done for my liking and ended up being quite chewy. It also came with fries, regular or truffle, we chose regular and they weren't anything special. . . Pork belly ($41) special of the day. Ridiculously over-priced for what it was. I don't usually talk about food in measurements but this is kind of necessary. The pork belly was a block about a 2x1.5 inches; about half the size of my iPhone. Half of which was all fat. I think I was swindled. Bouchon robbed me of my money and I kinda want it back. Oh well.  What little bit of meat I did eat was good, but not great.. . Furthermore, I'm aware that typically they serve bread and butter as well as pistachios before your meal. I actually had to request this after our entrees were served. Slightly annoyed? I sure was! . . I think this place is deserving of 3 stars. Half good and half bad... Right in the middle. I will prob come back, but not for a while.
My favorite place in Vegas! By far!! it really reminds me of a Brasserie in France and the food is sooooo goooood that makes me dream about it until coming back. The foie gras from Eiffel Tower is good but this one here is AMAZING! Last time I had mussels that were simply perfect and the meringue with red berries that was heaven on earth. I do recommend this restaurant to any person with good taste. Service is good as well.
Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bistro is truly a restaurant that strives for excellence.  You can feel it from the staff, waitresses, and everyone you come in contact with.  I had the breakfast classic of salmon, capers, cream cheese, tomatoes, red onion, and a French baguette.  A year without a breakfast at Bouchon is something I hope I never see.  Everything I haver ever had here is 5 Star!  I do love Las Vegas!
First, I'll post my disclaimer about Vegas restaurants:. I believe restaurants on the Las Vegas strip are often very overrated. My theory: People are in Vegas to party and have a good time. They often eat at these places while they're having a great time regardless of the quality of the food or restaurant. When they go to write a yelp review, they assume that the high price tag and the fun evening must mean that the restaurant was great. . . Despite all of this, I was pleasantly surprised by Bouchon. It doesn't have that fake night club vibe. The venue itself isn't designed to distract from the dining experience. In fact, it compliments it. It looks and feels like a french bistro without trying too hard. The outside terrace is also a great touch. . . The food itself was also great. I had the steak frites, and a great melon and prosciutto salad. Yes, for the first time, I actually enjoyed a melon and prosciutto salad.  They have reasonably priced wines, and good coffee.
Great, relaxing brunch!. . Food:. I was starving, so I ordered two meals: (1) French toast and (2) eggs, potatoes, and sausage.. . All of the food was great, although the potatoes were a little too greasy for me!. . The French toast, extremely rich, was just enough for me. I hurt myself eating the eggs, potatoes, and sausage.. . I was more impressed with the French toast, since I think I can cook decent eggs, potatoes, and sausage on my own. The four stars is really for the french toast; good stuff!. . Sides Notes. . Ambiance:. If it's not super hot outside, I recommend you sit outside. The restaurant is situated by the pool; ambiance is impeccable.. . Service:. The service was exceptional. Waiter was very patient and knowledgeable. Our waters were constantly refilled. The food came out reasonably quick.. . Overall:. If you're looking for a relaxing brunch, I definitely recommend!
Rarely, if ever, do I feel compelled to start a review by talking about how amazing the service is. Bouchon is just exemplary. The entire staff dishes out 5 star service without a side of snootiness or stuffiness. Everyone is polite, present, knowledgable, patient, approachable. Whether you're wearing shorts and a tee shirt or a three piece suit, you're treated like royalty. Despite this, the restaurant effortlessly balances what could easily become a very formal meal into a relaxed and enjoyable experience. . . Continuing the top notch theme, the food is smart and special. There were interesting concoctions all over the menu from sweet to savory, and it's all incredible right down to the butter!. . Bouchon is a Vegas must, particularly if you're on a culinary quest. On a final note, my husband is an iced tea connoisseur and undoubtedly dubs Bouchon's as the best in the country. Something about it... and now I'm thirsty.
Absolutely fantastic. This restaurant blew my expectations away, had bone marrow, seared foie gras, and the hangar steak. Three very rich courses, but paired with the right wine, fantastic!. . Service was excellent, their timing and planning was perfect in the way they brought out dishes. 3 courses, an aperitif, wine, digestif, took us about 2.5hrs total. $480 between three people. Will come back next time I am in Vegas.. . If you are used to fine dinning and require Michelin stars goes elsewhere. If you enjoy an extravagant, (literally) expertly/perfectly cooked meal, come to bouchon.. . Bon appetit
Bouchon is a must for breakfast. It's not cheap, but it's also not too pricey. It's like a casual version of fine dining. The service is there. The food is somewhat elevated. I've never had a bad meal. The croque madame (heavy) and french toast (light) are my go-to dishes, but everything's great - from the steak & eggs to a side of country sausage.
Classic French food. Found this place cus it was  just down from our room. It's is actually good and service was amazing! First time actually eating authentic French cuisine. They have locations nationwide in NY&They have an LA location too when I'm home in CA(:
