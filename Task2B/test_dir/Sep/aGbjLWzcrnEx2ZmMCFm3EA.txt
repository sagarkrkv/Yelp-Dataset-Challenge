My first time trying BurGR was at an Elite event last year.  We were lucky enough that night, to try the majority of the menu.  It was all amazing.  My table quartered the burgers so we could try different ones.  My faves were the Britannia Burger and the Euro Burger.  I didn't care for the Sticky Toffee Pudding Pop.  Cool idea but I could do with less salted peanut ice cream.  Recently I went back again with a friend from out of town who was staying at Planet Hollywood.  I got the Uber Cheese Burger  and the #4 shake.  My friend got the Farm Burger, #5 shake and we shared Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Everything was just as good as the first time.  We didn't have to wait long for a table and service was attentive.  Prices were average for a celebrity chef restaurant.  I only wish it wasn't such a pain in the ass to get anywhere in Planet Hollywood.
Was awesome. Was told an hour & 20 minute wait. Waited for 45. Didn't have to stand there, they texted us when our table was ready so we could walk around the mall. We were seated promptly and the waiter was really kind. Soon as I seen the Farm Burger, I knew I HAD to get it. Duck bacon, cheddar & a fried egg. Food came out really fast I was shocked being that they were really busy. Everything was so good. I should've gotten two. Great experience.
As stated on my profile, the BF and I are obsessed with sir Ramsey. Our dream is to visit all of his restaurants.. this was our first Gordon Ramsey experience..and a very pleasant one.. Pro's- Our food was absolutely scrumptious -I got the Earth Burgr and the Bf got the chicken one..we both cried while eating. It's like he knows exactly what the person is looking for taste-wise.. and he invents it.. absolutely amazing food.. We got seated fairly quickly and the hostess and manager were very friendly.. The decor is obviously beautiful its Vegas meets Gordon Ramsey.. you can't go wrong with that.. . Con's- Our waiter was talking TOO fast.. like unbelievably, and he didn't mention the specials they had that day .. we had to overhear him tell the table next to us about it.. WATEV'S. The restrooms are outside the restaurant..not a big deal just a minor walk. The wait for the food is pretty damn long.. but its obviously worth it..my taste buds have been grateful. . . I'll be coming back hopefully every time I am in Vegas.. I recommend everyone give this place a try at least one time.
Amazing Burgers! Obviously. When my husband and I go here we usually get one of two Burgers the farm burger or the hells kitchen burger. The farm burger has a fried egg on top with crispy duck breast bacon. We order it cooked to medium and boy is it juicy and delicious! By far one of the best Burgers I've eaten... In my life! We have also had the jalapeno poppers which are super tasty but watch out at least one per order is like the blazes of hell. Dude to me getting the hottest popper once I ended up getting the sticky toffee pop.. It was the bomb and also helped cool my mouth from the intense heat. The French fries are very good too, but the best fries are the sweet potato ones! They have some sort of sweet maple dip or something and it's just amazing! Love this place can't wait until the next time we hit it up!
So disappointed! !! My boyfriend and I where there yesterday for lunch. It was a 2 hourwait so we taught that it was going to be an amazing experience.  I was very excited to eat there since I am a fan of chef Ramsay. I ordered the hell's kitchen burger, very over cooked and no seasoning at alllllllll! my boyfriend ordered a burger with arugula and goat cheese. .he had the same problem with his burger.  Our server wasn't attentive and didn't check on us at all. We couldn't even bring our issues to their attention since everyone was just standing by the pos machines talking to each other. Worst vegas experience ever. Never again :( I want my money and time back! !!!
You know how sometimes you really really really don't want to like a place but you turn out to really really really LOVE a place? That was Burgr for me. . . The wait was an hour. There were open tables everywhere. After 30 minutes and my friend winning $100 dollars, we go back and check with the host and she seats is immediately. Cool! . . Our server Heather was amazing. Super nice and knowledgable. We wanted beers so she showed us a ipad with all the draught beers listed and even gave us samples. . . We started with the Honey Pork Buns. $12 for two buns. Totally worth it. Pickled radish and pickled ginger? Yes please! . . I got the Farm House Burger medium rare. My friend got the one with Truffle and Goat Cheese. Both burgers were full of flavor and all the simple ingredients mixed really well together. We shared Newcastle battered onion rings. . . For dessert..... OMG.... The shakes.... Holy moly.... I got the creme Brulee pudding with oreo shake and cookie. Whatever you do, get a shake. It's to die for. I can't even describe how good it is. Share it, too much for one person. . . Two people with beers, app. Burgers, side, and dessert.... $80 for lunch. Not to shabby. . . I would recommend this place and Guy Fieri's joint. . . I am 95% sure this is better than Holstein's inside Cosmo. There is a 5% of doubt... Eeeeekkkk!
Disclaimer: When we stopped by BURGR, the only thing I'd had all day was a half-yard Fat Tuesday so I was pretty drunk so keep that in mind when reading this review.. . So first off, my family and I are a little challenged and walked all around Miracle Mile and the casino floor looking for this restaurant. If you're coming in from the strip, BURGR's literally right there... by the other entrance 50 feet away from the entrance that goes into Miracle Mile. . . Anyways, so even on July 4th weekend (clearly I'm super punctual with my reviews), we only waited about half an hour for a party of 5 which was sweet because my drunk ass needed food in my system. I ordered The Farm burger and man it was good. The patty was perfectly juicy. The duck breast bacon was a little dry but the egg yolk kind of balanced that out. . . We also ordered the truffle fries & onion rings. I didn't think the onion rings were that special but the truffle fries were on point. They each came with two sauces but I only remember liking the truffle aioli that came with the truffle fries and chipotle ketchup that came with the onion rings.. . The server was super friendly and accommodating with everything. The only snafu was that we ordered a beer which took awhile (basically when we were half done with our food). The server asked the bartender what was up and I guess they make every drink in the order they're received even though the beer would take like 5 seconds to pour. That's not unreasonable but don't expect to have your beer with your food. Overall, a great spot to stop by. Sign up for a Total Rewards card to get a dollar off each item.
Delicous burger. Size was a bit smaller but every bite is heaven. French fries was awesome as well. The ambient is top notch. . . I ordered a few rum and cokes and they were real strong -must for being $10/piece.
After loving Gordon Ramsay for so long, we had to go check out burGR when we visited Vegas! . . The restaurant is inside Planet Hollywood right next to the casino, pretty easy to find, just follow the signs. We came around 11ish and the wait was around 20-25 mins so it wasn't that bad. . . Service was pretty good, except our server... We ordered a coffee shake and he brought out a chocolate shake instead. When we notified him of the error instead of bringing back the chocolate shake and giving us the right coffee shake, he wanted to charge us for an additional coffee shake for his mistake. Honestly, it was pretty disappointing for that to have happened at such a top notch restaurant. Kind of a downer at the end of our meal. . . Anyways onto the food!! We ordered an appetizer of the jalapeno poppers, overall it was delicious ! The sauce was yummy and the popper was crispy and flavorful. It is definitely SPICY - if you can't handle the heat you might want to try a different appetizer! Then we got the truffle fries with the garlic aioli and that was so yummy. The sauce is delicious and fries are always good with burgers :P I tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was delicious, all the ingredients were fresh and the bun was toasted perfectly. The burger was definitely bigger than I thought it was going to be, based on the pictures they looked really small but it definitely fills you up. This burger also had a kick in it since it has jalapenos in it, so if you don't like spicy, this probably isn't the burger for you. My sister tried the Britannia burger which had a mango chutney, and she loved it. If you like the combination of sweet and savory I would definitely recommend the Britannia burger. . . Overall it was such a good restaurant, I couldn't give it any less than 5 stars despite our terrible server. The shake mix-up was definitely disappointing and annoying, but the food was too yummy. Try and check burGR out when you're in Vegas !!
Went to dinner here Friday night. We waited for about 30 mins and thank goodness it was worth every min. U have to try the Farm Burger. It won't disappoint.
I tried this place because my sister's coworker recommended it.  The atmosphere is cool,but you might think you're at Hooters because the way the waitresses are dressed. I tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger,which seemed small for $15. The waitress did mention that the burgers were 7 ounces.  If you show your Total Rewards card,you get to save a dollar.  Unfortunately, I showed my card to one waitress then another waitress served my party's food.
Definitely not as amazing as everyone made it out to be. Not particularly a burger connoisseur, but still not impressed.  . For the price it's incredibly reasonable, considering everything else in Vegas is super expensive. . . Food is good, just not amazing.
We went to Gordon Ramsay BURGR at Planet Hollywood for Lunch.  It was really good, but didn't really compare in any way to Gordon Ramsay Steak.  It is funny how much he yells at contestants on his TV shows about their food being bland.  And I was surprised about how bland both of our Burgers were.  It was good, but fairly expensive and not great.  The best part of the meal by far were the Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Pops for Dessert.  If I were to go back I think I would just get a Shake and Dessert. Gordon Ramsay Steak is amazing in comparison!!!  Don't think if you didn't like BURGR that they can be compared in any way.  Because they are nothing alike and have nothing to do with each other!  They really need to add a good rub or seasoning to their Burgers.  Maybe some Sauces or something.  Just really dry and boring.  I haven't tried Bobby Flay's new Burger restaurant yet, but I have a feeling his is a lot better.  Gordon is my favorite on TV, but he needs to come over to my place and I will grill him a Hamburger.  I think we have found one thing that Brits and Gordon can't cook, and that is a good American Burger!
Went with my wife here for lunch. Loved the atmosphere. My burger and strawberry shake were amazing. Chicken wings had a unique taste (never tasted chicken wings like these before). Will have to go back and give final thoughts about the wings. My wife did not like her banana shake though. .  Overall, a really good BurGR joint ;-). . (09/02/2014)
Think you've tried every burger...... Think again.. . We tried this place just on a hunch and don't regret it one bit. We all thought we tried every burger out there but how we were wrong.. . We each tried adifferent burger, and when it came we split each burger. WE MELTED AT EVERY BITE.. . The wait was not bad and the price was decent. A must try when your on the strip.
Have been to Planet Hollywood  five times, and usually have lunch in Planet Dailies(will write review for that later).....there is usually an insane line for entry to BurGR, and that is plain stupid.....it is a very good burger, but not a great one.. . We ate at about 11:45 pm, all of us were there for the USN GVI and had been traveling all day.  No wait, and they accommodated two of us who showed up 45 minutes later, which was unexpected and very cool.. . Had the "American Burger" American cheese + butter lettuce + tomato. + pickle + onion....and I added bacon(came to about $15.00) protein style, no bun.. . Very juicy tasty burger....i just can't give a burger place a four star recommendation when there is so much damned attitude flying around.  The manager was great, very helpful, but everyone else from our server to the people bringing drinks seemed to want to be somewhere else.. . I would return, for sure.  It was a decent meal at a time of day I wasn't expecting to eat and the prices were fair.....but not cheap for sure.
I would add this to my list of favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  The interior is awesome and the furniture is awesome.  Very comfy dining chairs that is unlike most restaurants because I would always rather have booth seats, but this restaurant did well to make every table awesome.  . . And the food was memorable enough for me to write a review.  It did not matter if it has Gordon Ramsy's name on it or not, the Burger was awesome and had culinary attributes.  This burger definitely tasted better than any chain restaurant burger and alot more memorable.  So the slightly higher price was worth it, but since all food in Vegas is expensive and you could easily pay $10+ for a quick lame burger at some quick food spot by a hotel pool, I think this place was a good value.  Burgers here are only around $15, but it will  taste alot better than any burger you order for room service or by the hotel pool.  . . 2 burgers & sharing 1 fries with my friend (2 people) came out to $41.  Yeah that might sound expensive for burger & fries, but for a culinary experience to experience great food in an awesome environment it's a great value.   At around $20 a person, I think it's a good value especially that we were eating on the Las Vegas strip.  . . For a Las Vegas restaurant that will provide an actual experience, this is probably one of the coolest restaurants you will spend less money at.
Had the Hells Kitchen burger, beat burger I've ever had hands down. Good beer selection too, though I do wish it was a little more well rounded and offered a stout, a porter and a barleywine. But what they did have was pretty good.. . There was a bit of a wait to get in, but it moved pretty quickly. Once we were seated the service was stellar. Our waitress Tammy was great. Will definitely be back.
The second best burger I've had in my life! It's worth the long wait (hour and half) next to the broiler wall (what's that about? But it looks cool.) Worth the annoyance of underhanded theatrics where some people blatantly circumvent the line and bribe the hostess for prime seating (and she accepts the corrupt incentive), worth the slow service (where did our server go, is he even on duty anymore). . ...But boy, is it worth that atmosphere. All that frustration and vexations for a burger that when you bite into it you can't even begin to speak because of it's hold on your taste buds. You're lucky, the food is divine or this would be a back handed review.
Not very please with the service of the restaurant. The wait is incredibly long even after you sat down and It took a while to take down our orders. All which is understandable, but I was baffled when we were about to get seated, a couple paid the hostess money to get seated right away instead of waiting the hour that we did. Wouldn't expect that from the service of a Gordon Ramsey Restaurant. . . Food on the other hand was great! Got the hell's kitchen burger, buffalo wings, truffle fries and shake number five which was coffee and chocolate pudding. ALL DELICIOUS. The shake was incredible, nothing tasted so sweet and wonderful, it was like a party in my mouth. The burger had a good heat to it and was cooked perfectly. The truffle fries are so good especially with the red sauce which is a little like marinara sauce.
I dream of this place at least once a month. AT LEAST. Lucky for me I somehow end up in Vegas. . . . Jalapeno popper - Love them. Spicy with cheddar ranch to dip into, yum! Also, there's always the "extra spicy" one. My friends and I think it's fun to try and figure out whogot it. . Hell's Kitchen burger - UGH, my mouth is watering. The grilled jalapeno can be a little spicy ; beware. I asked for the jalapeno on the side the last time I had it. . . Farm Burger - SOOOO good. You can't go wrong with egg on a burger.. . Shake #5 - The only shake I ever get. Chocolate / Hazelnut pudding on top of coffee shake?! I mean, it's heaven.. . I LOVEEEEEE THIS PLACE.
Dining paradise in Vegas! Besides buffet and fine dining, there are so many good restaurants on the strip.  I would say Gordon Ramsay burgr is one of them!. . In order to avoid the line up, we went to there at 6ish.  Still have lined up when we arrived!  After 20 mins wait, we got seated.  Gordon Ramsay posters and TVs are at every corner.. . The music and background was so loud! May be we're too old for that... so we only ordered 2 burgers, finished and left right the way!. . Mushroom burger -  the mushrooms were so favorable and patty was cooked medium rare.  The meat still juicy inside and the bun was fresh! Hell's kitchen burger - avocado, oven roasted tomato and medium patty also cooked perfectly. . . Both burgers were huge, we just barely able to finish it.  We need bigger stomach for fries and shakes next time!
Best burger I've had yet! . I had the farm burger which comes with "duck bacon" that didn't sound too good, but was 100% delicious bacon. Fried egg need i say more?  The truffle fries where great with the house ketchup, but the truffle sauce was heavy and taste like mayo
My wife and I came here for lunch. I've eaten here before, but it was her first time. So we ordered the jalapeno poppers to start off with. It was really spicy but tasted really good. I can't really handle spicy hot but it was manageable. They come in shot glasses with a dipping sauce. I'd recommend this for a group so everyone can try it. . . I ordered the farm burger medium. My wife ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. The farm burger comes with an egg inside. The egg definitely makes it taste delicious. I think the next time I grill up some burgers at home I'm definitely putting a sunny side up egg inside. The runny yolk gives it a good taste that goes well with the bacon. The Hell's Kitchen burger comes with jalapenos inside. It was pretty good as well. . . This place is a definite must try if you're close to Planet Hollywood and are looking for a good burger. Don't forget to order the truffle Parmesan fries! The sauces it comes with is bomb!
A burger that is as simple and delicious as it sounds. If you want a classic burger they have it. If you want an off the wall burger they have it. Truffle fries!
Burgr is located at Planet Hollywood. I'm a big Hells Kitchen fan so I HAD to eat here. My husband and I went here on a Wednesday afternoon. It wasn't too busy so we got seated right away. It's a relatively small restaurant. . . The waitresses went over the drink menu and gave us a few recommendations. I didn't care for drinks because I was super hungry. We ended up getting the truffle fries and jalapeno bacon poppers. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. The jalapeno poppers are bomb!  They're pretty big and it's the perfect balance of cheese, jalapenos and bacon. It comes in 6 and 6 was kinda a lot for 2 people.  The truffle fries are steak cut and delicious. I got kinda full from the appetizers and didn't even touch my burger at the restaurant.  I ate my burger back at the hotel and it was so yummy.  It wasn't too spicy. It was still good even a couple hours later, so I'm sure it's super good fresh. . . I'd recommend this place if you're gonna be in Vegas!
Juicy burgers with sesame buns! It's delicious even as a to go cold burger, still tasty! You have to get the truffle fries with the aioli sauce! I never had thick truffle fries. I definitely say with thicker cut fries yoy can taste the truffle better. So delicious! Will come back again!
The truffle fries and poppers are super yummy. I would totally go back and service was fantastic and they played awesome music.
Reviews and pictures for this place looked amazing so we decided to order take out from this location (and very convenient since we were staying at Planet Hollywood. it's in the casino).. . You can only place takeout orders in person so we did. The hostesses were SUPER nice and accommodating. Even with a long line of people.. . Picked up our food after 20 min. Burgers were sadly mediocre. I didn't get that wow factor. Just your standard burger with fancy ingrediants. Got the Farm Burger with Duck bacon and fried egg.. . The parm truffle fries were pretty good. LOVED the truffle aioli dipping sauce. My fav part of the whole meal.. . For the amount of money we spent, I woudln't get a burger from here again.
I didn't know what to expect, but boy was I happy!! My bff and I sat at the bar after a 15 minute wait. They estimated 25 min, which I didn't mind. I got the Truffle Paresian Fries with the Hog Burger! It made me want to slap my momma!!! DELICIOUS!!
This place serves up one heck of a burger! There are so many clever combinations of burgers and names that goes with them.  I always like Gordon Ramsay's shows and I always wanted to try a restaurant of his. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it packs a punch. It comes with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomatoes. The meat was moist and juicy, the jalapenos makes it have a spicy kick, and all the other toppings makes the burger complete.  My friend ordered the Damnation Chicken Burger. When you order a chicken burger what do you think of?  Dry? Piece of chicken breast across a bun?  Not this place!  It was a patty style chicken burger that was moist.  It came with hot mayo, cheese, and a carrot slaw.  They also have fries, shakes, salads, and snack.  They have two unique ketchups one being a curry flavor and the other a chipotle flavor.  The decor thereis nice, clean, and sharp looking.  They have a bar where you can enjoy a drink while watching a sports game and having a burger.  Highly recommend this place to anyone.
It was by far the fanciest burger place I had ever been to. The line was ginormous but I'm happy to say, it was worth the wait. The burgers were pricey, but that was to be expected before I even sat down. fries are not served with the burgers, you have to buy those separately, which one order can easily feed 2 or 3. The apple pork burger was unlike anything id ever tasted before.  Though I did not have the appetite to order them, the desserts on the menu looked great also.This place is great if you are looking for a unique and somewhat upscale dining experience. they even let you keep the menu as a souvenir.
Major disappointment. Either Gordon Ramsay's shows are a fake ass front or he needs to get over here to BurGR and get things in order the way he makes it appear on tv. Having eaten at his pub and grill before and having a great experience I didn't think BurGR was going to be the way it ended up. The wait was 2 hours to get a table and once inside it took forever to even get our order taken. The jalapeno poppers we stared out with were terrible and I've had better at. sonic. The inside was still cold. Unfortunately cold food seemed to be the theme of the night. Our fries and onion rings were brought out cold. My burger was cold and flavorless while the hot dog I had was just ridiculously too big for the bun it was on. Our server and many inexcusable reasons why he didn't get our food to us sooner. When you first walk into this place they have flames shooting all over so where the heck was the hot food and flavor? I really hoped for a better burger at this place.
We ordered onion rings and truffle fries for appetizer. Onion ring was a little greasy but the batter is flavorable; on the other hand, truffle fries was much better.. Mu friends ordered burger coming medium. They said the meat was not dry but not that kind of watery juicy. I didn't try anyway.. I ordered soba noodle. I put the dressin on the side. Honestly, I don't like that peanut dressing. It's too thick for me and just like peanut butter.. Soba was overcooked. A little disappointed because i love al dente texture.. However, the dish overall was not bad sinceI like its mild flavor.
It was good, after visiting Gordon Ramsays Steak at the Paris, I was expecting this burger to blow me off my seat like at his other restaurant, but it was just a decent burger, nothing to get off your seat and yell "Oh MY GOD" over. Their sticky toffee pudding push up pops, MUST TRY!!!
Yum. The first time we tried to go here there was like an hour wait. No thanks. But the second time was around 11a or 12p and we got in no problem. The waitress outfits were a lil Star Trek hooch, but the guys got to wear cute GR jeans and some shirts. Shade. But our waiter was a cutie. Anyway, I got the American burger and split some Parmesan truffle fries with my friend. The sauce was interesting and the fries were good. The ketchup was definitely housemade and it was ok, but there was some stronger flavor in it like horseradish or something that I wasn't all that fond of. But my burger was perfectly done (med well), seasoned perfectly and had a nice little char on it. It was pretty big so a couple of us couldn't finish the burger in one sitting. It made for a great room temp late night drunken munchie snack though (we didn't have fridges in our room at PH, so if you get food poisoning from lack of refrigeration don't blame me). Everyone in my party seemed to enjoy the food. Love my Gordon.
BURGR still had a line at 9:30pm, but because I love Gordon Ramsey I had to try! 3 stars is an accurate reflection of my experience. The burgers were tasty, onion rings okay, and coffee shake very yummy.  I would definitely recommend getting the euro burger (aioli spread, roasted tomato, and goat cheese)
This review is for a visit when my family and I went to Las Vegas to attend a wedding back in March of this year.  AS a burger fan, I always like trying new places out, especially in Sin City, where the eateries are as abundant as the slot machines and paid escorts.. . Gordan Ramsay BurGR is located in side Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino.  Watching Hell's Kitchen in the past, I was always curious if Mr. Mean Chef lived up to his high expectations.  BurGR did just that.. . My sister and I went here for lunch while our parents went out to the casino.  There was a line, but it didn't take us too long to be seated.  Once seated inside you notice how modern the restaurant is, coupled with simple color accents or orange and brown.  Nice touch.  The table servers were pretty cool, as the male servers were dressed in all black, while the female servers were very attractive wearing one piece short dresses.. . My sister and I opted to try out the Farm Burger.  The burger features a beef patty with sharp cheddar cheese, duck breast bacon (YES, duck!) and a friend egg on a sesame seed bun.  I was skeptical at first, as I am not too big into duck, but this burger was FANTASTIC!  Full of flavor, the duck didn't taste gamey, and was juicy and cooked with quality ingredients.  No complaints here!. . The side were just as phenomenal as the burger.  BOTH the onion rings and fries were cooked to a crispy, golden brown, and topped with shredded parmesan cheese.  The equalizer?  The ranch dip had cheddar cheese mixed into it!  All these great flavors played off each other, creating a fabulous food medley!. . I would go back here again to try out the other burgers.  A cool touch was there was a photographer who took our picture and gave it to us - I thought it was cool!  Good thing I said something before the picture letting him know I was with my sister haha.  The only gripe I had about my visit was that a random table server accidentally spilled water on my shoulder.  No big deal, as it was just water.  If it was something else, I would've demanded to see Gordon himself!!!  Fellow Yelpers, try out this place before you blow all your money on the tables and slots!!!
Just soo salty... The wait was 20 min but there were soo many empty tables inside. There were large groups and pairs but we were all seated as we were lined up... Which does not make sense in anyway. We ordered the Hell's Kitchen and the farm burger and sweet potato fries. Again burger was sooo salty. We loved the sauce of the sweet potato fries but the fries were half soggy and half crispy. ::sigh::: I wanted to like this place so much...I m just so disappointed. HIGHLY not recommended but you guys will try it anyways. :)
The burger was good but I've had better.  I guess I expected more since this is their specialty.
EuroBurgr, one of THE best burgers I've had in my life!!! Delicious. Get it medium rare, if not, you don't understand food. But try! Pink beef is good.
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!!. . Hygiene,  hygiene,  hygiene! . . I'm writing about the horrific hygiene at this place.   One of the servers was putting on her lipstick and lip liner at the hostess/check in station,  handles plates and silverware.  . . I'm walking to our table I see another lady sneeze into her hands with both hands cupped.  Didnt wash her hands, just started fixing her her eyeliner with her finger tips.   I told my wife, "oh my gosh  hope this person isn't serving peple", and then she walks up to our table and introduces herself stating that she will be our waitress.   I was literally sick to my stomach. . . I asked to see the manager, and about 10 minutes of waiting told him the deplorable practices I observed, and left. I wish good old Gordon was there to throw a fit!!!. . Stayaway if you value your health!
Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and added an egg on top.  It was delicious.  I think I like Burger Bar, at Mandalay better, and I'm usually not a big fan of Gordon Ramsay.  This was a good burger though.  I easily ate the whole thing.  That with a couple of the many beers on tap, made for a great meal!. . We also ordered some sweet potato and regular fries.  They came out hot and crispy.  Service was also good.  No problems and everything went smoothly.. . The main reason that BurGR is 4 stars and not 5 is because there was nothing overly special.  The food is expensive for a burger, but it is a good burger and was worth it.  I did want dessert after the meal, but when the waitress brought the dessert menus, I realized that it was just the 4 milkshakes that I saw on the menu earlier.  In addition, they also do not serve any coffee after dinner.  That was a bit of a pain.  I'm slightly confused why they even offer "dessert."  Overall, good meal, and i'm sure i'll be back one day...
My BF and I decided to grab a quick bite somewhere and ended up here at BurGR, since we were staying at Planet Hollywood anyways. . . There were plenty of seating around 3PM and the restaurant was quite empty, but the hostess still made us wait 5 minutes. Lol! Anyways, our waiter was really attentive and quick. They have the coolest menus ever! It's folded on top of your napkin, and once you open it, there's a picture of Gordon Ramsay. You can also keep the menu as a souvenir too! The drinks are all on the Ipad. . . We ordered the Hog Burger which consisted of mangalitsa pork, cheddar, arugula, and maple butter. The meat was juicy! However, the burger was lacking in flavor. We also ordered the Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings and it was heaven! They give you two dipping sauces- chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch!
Killa burger and fries.... Nice decor and scene... Plenty of flames !! Pricey but hey its Vegas
Best burgers in Vegas! Be sure to try the Hog burger, it's amazing. Best of all, the waitresses are HOT.
BEST BURGERS IN VEGAS!!!!!! I wish they would open one in Florida! The line wasn't that bad! If your eating somewhere that has a long line it's gotta be good!  Our server was awesome, Very quick and funny! We got our menus and ate with our eyes. Everything looked so good. We had just landed from a 4 hour foodless flight so we were hungry! I ordered  the American burger. My husband ordered the uber burger and we also decided to get the fries and onion rings! The onion rings came to our table very quickly and where gone even quicker! THE BEST ONION RINGS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!! They had a generous amount of Parmesano-reggiano sprinkled on them and  some chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip that tasted like sour cream and cheddar chips when you dipped them in it! Soooooo goooood!!!!! Our burgers were next and they where beautiful! I had to try to figure out how I could take abite of it and get everything on the burger in my mouth at once! It was sooooo good! The meat was cooked perfectly the toppings tasted like they where just picked off the farm! We where soo full that we had to take the fries to go! Everything was so good! We had a lot of good food while we were in Vegas. We don't gamble so we were there for the shows and the food! We splurged on our meals because we wanted the best and we got it! Burgr was Definitly in the top 5 places we have EVER eaten at!
British Chefs - 1. American Chefs - 0.. . Way to go Gordy for beating America at their own game. Pow, tough blow. Sorry!. . Ok, joking aside... wow! Hubby and I have been wanting to visit BurGR for quite a while and the wait was totally worth it. Our first night in Vegas with family visiting from England we brought them here and everybody left happy. . The Burger choice that dominated our party of 5 was the Farm BurGR (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww) - $15. Duck Breast Bacon, English Sharp Cheddar and a Fried Egg, oh my! I'm not usually one to have Fried Egg's on well anything really but what a combination. With the Burger cooked medium everything worked in perfect harmony. The Egg was perfect, the Beef was perfect and the Cheddar.. Omigosh REAL Cheese!! I'm getting excited just thinking about it. Honestly the best Burger I have had and I have tried a lot in the last 4 years. . Doesn't it look gooood? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#TEjwrTxroAEuQetkvvbq_Q. . - Fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#f3JKGLIzBcGQ8WBlHkvXJg) - $8. Served with Curry Ketchup & Chipotle Ketchup. The Curry Ketchup was delicious but the Fries themselves really were nothing special, just your average deep fried Potato. You could omit these from your meal and not miss them. . . The Milkshakes here are delicious too, more of a Dessert than a Milkshake due to the layer of Pudding on the top of them. My Husband and I decided to share one during our first visit and enjoyed it so much we ended up coming back the following night just so that we could have another. They do take a while to arrive though, probably due to the complexity of making them.. . - Shake #4 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#3ESC7tVlSjesQ7UnKDuGRw) $9. Oreo Shake topped with Creme Brulee Pudding, whipped Cream and an Oreo Cookie. Get this one! Seriously. Of the 2 I tried this was by far the best and although Creme Brulee and Oreo together seemed a little wrong to me it turned out to be oh so right.. . - Shake #2 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#beA0lKBsYSIdxqCK8lp5Qw) - $9. Strawberry Shake topped with Coconut Pudding and a Chocolate Cookie.. . Service was fine, efficient but not amazing but once your food arrives who needs someone coming around every 5 minutes checking up on you anyway.. . *TIP*. Very little wait on a Wednesday evening - 6:30pm, 5 people = 10 minutes!
As you walk toward BurGr you'll see a line out the door! Don't walk away and think it's not worth the wait! Get in that line and get ready for a gastro-yummified FEAST! We ordered the Chanterelle burger, The Blue burger and The American. We also ordered 1 order of Onion rings & 1 order of the Parmesan truffle fries- these were amazing! The onion ring garlic aoli was better than the rings themselves. They were cool to touch when they came out. The portions on the fries and onion rings were enough for the 3 in our party to share. We had lots leftover. The burgers were Amazing! The buns had black sesame seeds and were perfectly toasted. My Chanterelle had an onion marmalade and Arugula on it. I ordered it medium and it came out perfectly cooked. My sisters Blue burger had Maytag blue cheese and Arugula. Good, I've had better though. Not enough Blue for me.  The American was very good too. Just boring for my taste but my other sister enjoyed it. I also had a better than Starbucks cup of coffee which sounds weird but is totally true. All said I would definitely go back to eat here again. I didn't even mind paying the $89 tab after that wonderful meal! Yum!
If you are a party of two there is a line for you to wait, but if you have a bigger group, they'll text you when your table is ready so you don't have to wait in line.   . . My friends and I all got one shake of different flavors.   I got the Creme Brulee pudding with oreos milkshake, it was the best one out of all them.   But, even with my sweet tooth, I couldn't handle all the sugar, it was straight up diabetes in a cup.     . . All their burgers are delish but it is very salty.   A fair warning.   This is definitely a man's meal, if you know what I mean, not for the faint in heart.
"Go for a meal". Service slow hence a 4. The food was excellent. Chicken and beef burgers were amazing and the jalapeno starter as good. Thesweet potato and truffle fries were big do sharing even between 3 possible
BurGR has the absolute best burgers by far. I loved the food here. The meat was so fresh, juicy, and generously portioned. . . However,what made this the best burger I've ever had??? . The bun!!! I don't know what they do to their buns, but they tasted buttery and slightly crispy, they were perfect. The bun completes the perfection of the burger. . . The time that we went we didn't have to wait, but I know there generally is a pretty decent wait! Wait, beleive me it is so worth it!!!!!!
I love all the different combos of flavors and the prompt service is amazing every time i go there even though they were busy as heck we were seated within minutes. im not a fan of goat cheese i am always getting to tangy of a flavor but this goat cheese burger was sooooo good really creamy and smooth with subtle tangy-ness that slowly builds and the meat is so juicy cooked medium and perfect.
Bon service, cher pour un burger et vraiment sans plus! Dans un pays ou l'hamburger est roi, celui-ci a vraiment l'air ridicule. Nous ne parlons vraiment pas de haute cuisine! Mayonnaise aux truffes delicieuse.
Delicious!!! Got the Gordon Burger. Perfectly cooked. Good Job Christina! She even took a moment to take a picture with the kids!
I can vouch for some one else's comment about hygiene as our server spent most of her time playing with her hair, running her hands through it etc before handing us our plates....not really what I would expect in any restaurant to be honest.. . There is absolutely no organisation to the queue to be seated so there were people stood everywhere and you didn't know who was waiting to be seated or even seen to.. . We were told there would be a 2 minute wait despite the fact there were loads of empty tables and servers stood around doing nothing.. . The food tool ages to arrive and once it did it was cold, our server didn't even bother to come back and check if our food was OK!. . My husband ordered the Parmesan truffle fries and it was like eating a bucket of salt.. . We ordered a chocolate and caramel milkshake for dessert, the milkshake part was nice but the caramel on top was tasteless. . . All in all I wouldn't bother eating here again. Burger probably would have been nice if it was actually hot but the rest of the food and service was utter tosh.
Just had the Hells Kitchen burger and it was AWESOME.. . Service is cute but Not overly attentive- it's Vegas, what do you expect!!. . Burger was literally, mouth watering.  Killed some sweet -potato fries with jalepeno aioli.... . Seriously.  A delicious burger, after leaving Guy's place up the street for a REAL burger !!!!. . F donkey sauce in it's ear!
I'm a Gordon Ramsay fangirl as much as the next person, and after a good experience at Steak this was next on my list to try. Prior to seeing the O show, BF and I came here for dinner on a Friday night- not thrilled that they don't take reservations so the line wraps around the corner for a predictable 30 minute minimum wait. But the hostess was super sweet and the wait went fast.. . BEER BATTERED MAUI ONION RINGS: The cheddar-ranch dip made this dish for me, but wasn't enough to save the rings for my guy, who felt they were overly breaded and not crispy enough. Wouldn't get again but loved the sauce.. . HELL'S KITCHEN BURGER: asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno pepper, avocado, and oven roasted tomato. Looked a bit more delicious than it actually tasted, the jalapeno is a kick in the mouth that is quickly quelled by the cold, creamy avocado and roasted tomato. Wish it came with more than one roasted jalapeno, the first bite of combined flavors was best, the rest only had one or two of the featured ingredients and came off as bland.. . FARM BURGER: duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. The egg makes this, but everyone else seems to say the bacon makes it. I'm not a huge bacon fan but expected to be converted by this one. Not so much. Egg yolk plus medium-rare burger was delish, cheese flavor was lost and overpowered by the other ingredients.. . TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES: After the 'rings ordeal, I didn't think we needed another side but BF insisted. The order is enormous and even with our large appetites we did not come close to finishing. The truffle parm and truffle salt don't hold a candle to the amazing truffle aioli. . . SHAKE #5: coffee shake, chocolate pudding, "praline cookie". Served in one giant glass with two wide boba-style straws, this was a tasty treat. Liked that it wasn't super sweet. Praline cookie is more of a wafer without much flavor.  . . OVERALL:  Food didn't quite live up to the hype: bummed there isn't a mushroom burger with cheese on the menu, but for the two burgers we did order, the cheese was understated with both. Would customize a burger on a future visit, subbing chantrelle mushrooms for the tomato on the Euro burger. Rounding up for quality, as the actual beef was by far the best burger I've had in a damn long time.. . Shout out to the hostess, who was super sweet, brought out a menu to view while in line, was the first of two staff to recommend the HK burger we ended up getting.
Three of us decided to dine at BurGR since we're all fans of Gordon Ramsay and were in the mood for some good burgers. Staff was friendly and courteous.  They seemed a little occupied with flirting with one another. We notice a few of them checking their personal mobile phones multiple times within the 1.5hrs we were there. . The cocktail drinks were very flavorful and fun. . For our meal we had:1) the truffle fries, which were perfectly done and accompanied with 2 house dipping sauces...yumm, 2) Hells Kitchens burger which was very tasty, 3) American Burger which was also perfectly done and flavorful and 4) the Damnation Chicken burger. . The chicken burger was very disappointing. The description on the menu failed to state that the chicken meat was ground meal vs a solid chicken breast. This was a major challenge for me and very unpleasant as I am NOT a fan of ground meats. I am very specific about texture and quality of the protein i consume, nevertheless, I ate the burger. It was very well seasoned and cooked however it was very difficult getting passed the ground meat texture in my mouth :(   . I am a big fan of Gordon Ramsay and felt a little uncomfortable returning my order especially since the other 2 individuals loved their orders. That really ruined the dinner experience for me and it changed my impression of GR, a 'perfectionist'. Just wish the menu had specified the ground meat element of the chicken.
Sat at the bar...bartenders were cute and attentive..  . I ordered "The Hog Burger" which was phenomenal.  Juicy, with a bit of sweetness from the Apple butter. . . I also ordered the truffle parmesan fries with the truffle ailoi...delicious, generous on the parmesan. . . I also washed it all down with the "#4" shake which is creme brulle pudding, oreo shake, and oreo cookie. . . To top it all off my burger was personally brought out by Hell's Kitchen winner, Christina Wilson. . . Great experience overall, great food,  second time dining here.
Had the Britannia burger it was good.. the place was a little loud. Server was knowledgeable about items they offered.. I would go back again!
The wait in line annoyed me for a burger joint GR or not however the customer service made me forget it . I ordered a basic american straight to the point and burger out. I probably should have been a lot more wild in my selection my onion rings never showed but my helpful server took them off my bill and apologized no biggie my fries were enough to share so I was happy to save some money.On the real our server Matt was beyond exceptional and my Ice Tea was the best I have ever had.  Pretty cool tourist experience.  The flavor ketchups were the cherry on the sunday.
For a man that's so popular on television, Gordon got it wrong. The asian dishes on the menu can't compete with China town. The burgers were ehh. I am reviewing this place based on worth and price. It's not worth eating here and spending so much money for the 'experience'. Go down to the linq and find you Fuku burger. Just sayin.
Food was amazing!! Staff was very friendly too. Wait time was pretty long tho, my only complain.
Good burgers but even greater fries and sauces. I didn't like the chicken burger but farm burger and the hog burger (?? The signature one) were both good. . . Love the sauces with the sweet potato fries and truffle Parmesan fries! Will be coming back for these!! . . The sticky toffee pudding pops weren't as good as they're hyped up to be. Too milky for me. . . Attentive service!
Greatest burger in the history of man! Drinks were phenomenal (we ordered then all) and service was outstanding! Try to get on the list atleastan hour prior to when u want to eat
The food here is awesome! Had the burger and it was definitely the best burger I've ever had. The fries...OMGAH the fries were the best especially with the sauce. I will never forget this place.
This was the second time that went Burgr. The first time was just okay. I went such a long time ago that I don't remember much of anything. This review consists of my visit on Sunday 9/21. . . I had a great experience. We arrived at 12pm, and there was no wait. We were seated immediately, and a server came immediately to bring an ipad with cocktails we would be able to order. There were technical difficulties with the ipad, which we didn't mind since we weren't interested in drinking. . . We all ordered the farm burger because it looked the best. I didn't like the last burger that I had, while this one tasted delicious. It was a burger with duck bacon and an egg. I asked for mine to be medium, but I felt like it was more medium rare. I'm not much of a steak fan, so I don't prefer the taste of beef/steak so much. The duck bacon and the egg mixed really well, so it was absolutely delicious! The egg was cooked medium, do when I cut my burger, the egg just spilled onto the plate. Sadly, I lost a lot of my yolk, but that's the price I had to pay. :( The duck bacon was thicker than normal bacon, but it was absolutely delicious. My friend ordered Truffle Fries which were much thicker than I expected. I actually don't like the taste of truffle and I don't know why people put it in everything. But, that's just my opinion. They did sprinkle the fries with some sort of cheese which I did like. They make their own dipping sauces- one of which was ketchup and I forgot the other one. The ketchup tasted sweet and reminded me of tomato juice.  . . The service was spot on. The waitress kept coming over to refill drinks whenever they got low. The waiter brought out our check and when my friend presented her total reward card, he quickly brought her out a new tab. . . The only problem I had was the wait for the burgers was super long. It took quite a while for us to get our food. Other than that, great burger and great service.
Love this place!!! Yummy food!!! And a vegan can eat here too.  The staff is very responsive to special request to plant based healthy eating.  The cocktails are amazing and my husband love the beer list.  The service was awesome!!!!
my poppers were 50% smaller than the picture posted on yelp and not as good as the first time I had them :(  I also ordered the fish burger because when I was in london I had fish and chips at his restaurant and they were amazing. The fish was soggy on the bottom with the cooking oil soaking into the bun, the dill tarter sauce was flavorless and bland it even lacked salt. Pretty sad compared to my first visit I won't be back...too many other outstanding restaurants in vegas!
This is by far one of the best burger places I have been too! The wait tends to be long but don't let it scare you off. . . We tried a lot of different items. . Sweet potato fries. Truffle Parmesan fries. Onion rings. Jalapeno poppers. The many sauces. Hog burger . Hell's Kitchen burger. Cheeseburger. . Everything was a MUST have. The poppers were the best item by far and the milkshakes are ridiculously amazing as well!!
Not a huge burger fan, but a fan of GR. First time here, it didn't disappoint.. Taste is 3-4 stars to me and extra star earned for the service, decor, and the experience.. Several signature burgers to choose from. The chanterelle burger has figgy-onion jam with arugula. This pretty must sums my taste buds so it worked out. The patties tasted nothing more than beef with salt and pepper. I suppose the toppings make the burger.. Decently sized.. . Truffle parm fries were good, however, I found myself dipping the fries in the house ketchup more than the truffle aioli. Hmmm. . . It's a cute, fun place to experience. You also get to keep the menus as souvenirs. Ramsey thought this one out..as I wanted to 5 finger discount it when I first saw it!. . I wouldn't make it my first choice to come back here when in town. Then again, I'm not burger fan.
If you want a taste of celebrity chef food with a price anyone can afford, I'd highly recommend this place.  We had a group of maybe 10 people.  We saw the long line of people waiting to get in for dinner and inquired at the host stand.  We were going to have a long wait for a table that size, but we wouldn't have to stand in line any longer, they'd text us when they were ready, and we were free to gamble and drink elsewhere in the casino while we waited.. . Roasted Jalapeno Poppers 5/5 - Best I've had.  Each are good sized and come in their own shot glass with dipping sauce.  I'm glad I tried these.. . Truffle Parmesan Fries 4/5 - Pretty good, plenty of them, easy to share. . Farm Burger 5/5 - Duck Breast Bacon, Sharp English Cheddar, Fried Egg...that truly says it all.
I love the food here. One of my favorite burger places. I've eaten here several times. Besides the burgers; the gourmet dogs, the onion rings, and the jalapeno poppers are awesome. Huge selection of beers on tap. Service and ambiance are mostly top notch. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars (I'd give it 4 1/2 if I could) is sometimes the bartenders are not that attentive. Other times they are great!
My husband and I split a farm burger and sweet potato fries and were completely full! The burger was delicious and the fries were really good as well! We even got to see Hell's Kitchen winner, Christina who is the head chef there now! It was very exciting since we are big fans of Ramsey and his shows!
Three stars for the following reasons, I'd do 3.5 if I could: fries were not great, tough and almost cold, we were there late at night so they could have been older but I expect more from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Another point detracted for thenoise - this casino is LOUD with loud music pumping through the lobbed and the restaurant is smack dab in the middle with nothing done to tone down the loud outside music. . . Now the good: this is a great burger. Great. I had the American, the meat is flavorful and clearly above average quality. Loved the cheese on this, it wasn't fake tasting and was perfectly melted. Condiments complimented rather than competed with the meat and cheese. GET A SHAKE! It is the best thing there, just wish there were a spoon with it to eat the delicious pudding off the top. A very unique and delicious shake experience.  The ketchup with the fries:  loved the chipotle, despised the curry. Just my personal opinion. . . Service was great, attentive and friendly with water glasses refilled instantly despite the place being packed close to midnight. All in all a good dining experience but not as mind blowing as I would expect from a perfectionist chef.
Pretty tasty food. I had the Hell Kitchen burger with truffle fries. The burger was good. I didn't feel like I needed to add anything to it, but the peppers could have been hotter.  The bun, was fantastic and made this burger stand out over many others. The truffle fries were ok, but not out of this world. I kind of wished I had some normal ketchup as opposed to the fancy, but slightly odd tasting gourmet ketchup.. . I will probably come back to this restaurant again someday.
Awesome food, but Ramsay really won't put his name on anything less.  Burgers are well worth everything, I've been there twice and tried one pork and one normal.  Myfriend's pork he claimed was overcooked, but I thought mine was excellent.  Fries are interesting and out of the ordinary.  I'm not really sure why they have a wait most of the time, they don't fill all the seats all the time, maybe it's to feel more "exclusive."  Wait staff is pretty solid and attentive, but the (female) outfits are awesome.  I want to get my girlfriend one...
Holy crap, awesome doesn't even begin to describe it.  We only waited 15 minutes in line, but it would've been worth a 2-hour wait, easily.  The parmesan truffle fries and accompanying aioli will change your life.
Got here about 10 minutes before open and were second in line. By the time they opened on Saturday morning there were about 20 behind us.  Since we got in so early chef Christina ever so graciously allowed us to get a picture. I ordered the gordon which is not on the menu, ground pork and bacon with avocado, bacon and cheese. My girlfriend got the farm burger. Enough fries to easily split for two.  Gordon burger was phenomenal as was the bite of the farm burger I got which I think has an egg on top.  The waiter asked for how to cook my burger and I responded that I didn't know pork burgers had an option. Regardless both burgers were incredible but I wasn't blown away by the ketchup options, curry ketchup and honey I believe. My brother raved about the ketchup but it's not for me.  Burgers were around $14 to $18.  Great place overall but come early or expect to wait an hour or more.  Also I'd skip the fries at $7 and try the jalepeno poppers instead.
I saw this establishment when I flew in for work and was looking for some burgers for dinner. Turned this app on and Viola!! BurGR, by Gordon Ramsay. So we give it a go.. . Fries are out of this world!!! Specially the Truffle fries. The burgers were good, but isn't the best I've ever had. Sorry guys. That being said, I would probably come back here to try the other burgers or maybe some of the appetizers. They look amazing. (",) happy eating!!!
Don't go if you're vegetarian/vegan. The meatless/portebello burger has good flavor but does not hold together. It's not put together well it greatly takes away from the experience. The fries were cold and hard like they'd been sitting for quite some time. Service was not so good either. No thanks.
Amazing! Great tasting food full of flavored. The service was great and the food was truly great. The price is fair for the quality that you get. I will be going back, I recommend the truffle fries and uber cheeseburger.
Came here for dinner with my bf because the truffle fries and pudding shakes were highly recommended to him.  We were not disappointed!  We also had the Farm Burger and I forgot which hamburger my bf got, but everything was delicious!  The truffle fries were crisp and absolutely heavenly.  My burger was piled high, and the fried egg just made it that more delicious!  I made sure to save room for the pudding shake, which we shared.  We had the chocolate hazelnut coffee shake and I was surprised how good it was. Not overly rich or sweet.  A must try!!
Well you just have to try somewhere with the name Gordon Ramsey on it, even if they can't spell burger!  And try it you well should because it's darn good!. . This has a modern and relatively pleasant interior.  The menu design is amazing, anyone opening it is just stunned, you see it on everyone's faces.  In some ways it's a bit much, this is not your moms burgr place!. . However food is of course the main thing of importance...... . I got the special Gordon Burger.  I felt this to be an original name for a special in a, well, Gordon Ramsey burger place.  Duck bacon, pork burger. Real English cheddar, arugula lettuce, avocado, peppers. Delectable and I mean one of the best burgers I've ever had, the duck bacon is just awesome and flavorful beyond belief, but the whole combination is true bliss - mind blowing!. . Side of onion rings - best I've ever had, thank you England!  Great ketchup too as only is to be expected.  Hello, knock knock - great onion rings and awesome ketchup does it get better than this?. . Service too was pretty good, but I'd go for the food alone with this one.
Soo... This place would receive a 5star if the hostess girl (black hair) tonight wasn't such a B**** to us. She was rude and unorganized.. . My parents and I were excited to try the place out. Overall, this place is a wonderful burger place. Ramsey's burgers are not a disappointment, they were delicious! I hope to try the fries next time.. . Farm burger- delicious and perfectly medium rare! A must try!. . Jalapeno Hell's Kitchen burger- good as well, I enjoy the farm burger more. Not really spicy.. . Hog burger- didn't try, my dad said it was excellent, they scarfed it up! I have to try it some time. . . I will definitely return :) and hopefully not run into the cranky, unorganized chick.
Food was great.  Sweet potato fries were outstanding.  The chili dog was awesome.  Service great.
Sat at the bar, no complaints. The barkeep was attentive! Food came out quick! The truffle fries were amazing, the ketchup taste more like marinara sauce but it was good, the truffle dip was really great! Got the lamb burger it was exactly as described!
Oh my goodness, how do I not have a review for this place already? This is my favorite spot on the strip for burgers. The main reason that this spot up'ed Holsteins for me is that there's something special about the texture of their thick beef patties that almost has a melting effect once it hits your taste buds. I really don't know what it is and I would have never thought that it would make a difference but after coming here, both my boyfriend and I found ourselves looking for that texture and flavor in other burgers. Their brioche buns are amazing as well and also, all of their shakes have a pudding layer. So evil.. . BurGR faves:. Chanterelle Burger-  chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, fig-onion jam. Farm Burger- DUCK BREAST BACON (yes it's that good that it needs the caps lol), English sharp cheddar & fried egg. Euro Burger- truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, oven roasted tomatoes.. . Truffle fries & Sweet potato fries- I know that every burger place has these on their menu but it's BurGR's sauces that set them above the rest for me . . Shake #2: strawberry shake w/ coconut pudding + chocolate cookie. Heaven!. .  Another thing to add, everytime I've come here the service is amazing. All of waiters/waitresses give the same extensive treatment of talking about their entire menu, giving recommendations and having the best attitudes. They are all also very quick without seeming rushed. There are not many places that I've been to where all of the staff members are on the same level of great quality service. Awesome training on management's part.. The only thing I would mention, these ladies and gents need a new uniform!!!! It is the TIGHTEST (not in a good way) most unflattering uniform I have seen! You can see every little dent and fold on them lmao I feel bad for them! Haha But anyways, other than that, this place gets an A+ in my book! Can't wait to go back! :)
I have been here few times and had few of their choices.. . *lines are pretty long, but worth the wait.. . My favorite is the Euro burger adding an egg on it, Earth burger is pretty good too.. . They are very busy and the place is always completely packed up, compare to how busy they are they keep pretty high service standards and employees are pretty nice.. . Its not cheap for a burger, but you are in Vegas so its still cheap meal compare to most restaurants around... For a Burger plus french fries plus drink would run around $30 a person not including the tip.. . Ohhh the french fries very fresh as well and come with two delicious sauces.
Celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.!!! Today is Saturday 1:20pm. The wait line is long, we waited about 40 minutes in line. We had to try Gordon Ramsay burger! Worth the wait!! Yelpers gave great review so we had to try Gordon Ramsey's burger! We ordered the hog burger, the classic american, the famous truffles fries, sweet potato fries, and sticky toffee pudding push pops. OMG! It was the best burger meal we ever had! Cooked perfectly. The dessert made me feel like a child again! Nostalgic feeling! Everything delicious!! Great service!! On our bill there is an iphone attached to the bill to do a survey.
If you love burgers, then you MUST try Gordon Ramsay's Burgr restaurant! This place is currently in my top 5 burger restaurants.. . Food:. I ordered the Farm Burger. The fried egg was cooked over easy, so when you bite into the egg, they yolk will ooze out and create a nice spread throughout the burger. The quality of the meat was on another level, and the cheddar cheese that melted on the meat was the perfect complement.. . Sides Notes. . Ambiance:. The decor was casual with TVs throughout. The eye opener was the wall of fire. Yes, real fire.. . Service:. The service was great, considering the restaurant was packed, and there was a 1.5 hour long wait. Be prepared to wait!. . Overall:. Although I waited 1.5 hours, I would still say that it was worth the wait. Put your name down on the list, and go gamble.. . I highly, highly recommend Burgr!
There seems to be a long wait and the prices are on the high side, but they had the best burgers I've ever had. The onion rings and sweet potato fries were also amazing as well as an attentive staff made this one of the best times I've had in Vegas.
This place should be called fries not Burgr my buddy and I had his chicken burgers they were both terrible ended up sending them back. My burger was suppose to be spicy with blue cheese and coleslaw the blue cheese over powered the burger and there was no spice to it. The only decent thing was the fries but even they had too much parm on them. Very disappointed with this restaurant.
Ever since being a fan of Gordon's shows, I've developed an interesting way I critique restaurants. I've never cared about presentation, or colors, or small menus, or POS systems, or uniforms, but thanks to GR I do. I am a pretty harsh critic and generally treat people the way Gordon does. I'm told that I'm nasty and no fun to be around and just a totally jerk. Gordon does the same and is a millionaire, go figure. . . Anyway, this place is pretty damn cool!  The entrance has a chic Burgr sign, surrounded by glass encased fire. A real spectacle. Normally I'dbe embarrassed to get my large behind's photo taken in front of a burger joint, but everyone was doing it!  The line in front of the sign is long, and you can give them your number to text you when your table ready, a bit excessive to wait over an hour for a burger. . . Got our text and showed up for our meal. Sat down, waiter hands you an iPad to look through drink specials and the like. I ordered a squatters double IPA on draft so I was happy. Some party members got a blood orange cocktail and a skinny girl lemonade. High priced, but that's Vegas!. . Next we looked at our menus, why is Gordon's bust there engulfed in flames?  Why?  Pretty tacky, but the waiter said to keep them.  My girlfriend will like the souvenir, as opposed to the $25 tshirts they sell.  We ordered our meals. I started with Onion Rings as a "snack."  Just call them appetizers. Anyway, they were heavenly. I've never imagined a better onion ring. Hand battered, fresh cut, and the addition of Parmesan cheese was an incredibly nice touch. The ketchup and other dipping sauces were made in house and great as well. I ordered the farm burger, medium, also. It came out perfectly cooked, beautiful presentation, and tasted wonderful. The rest of the party were delighted with their selections as well.. . The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because, come on, it's a burger joint, and it has over an hour wait and comes out to around $50 per person with fries and a drink. That's just too expensive, even for Vegas. Will I return?  Hell yes, because I am a sucker and the food was damn good!. . Note: If someone is a member of total rewards, bring your card, if not sign up in Planet Hollywood first, it's $1 off each item per person, well worth it for 5 minutes to get a free card.
Great food, fun atmosphere, and excellent service.  Thank you Ms. Christina Wilson for taking time for some photos with our daughter Katie, making her your favorite shake, and personally delivering it to her!  What a fun experience. We will for sure be back upon our next visit to Vegas and highly recommend this place if you want a really yummy burger, appetizers, fries, and much more.
We were excited about having a good burger in Vegas... But alas this place wasn't the greatest for the Best Burger. Nevertheless, the burger was just ok. It was expensive for what you got, but then again it's Vegas right?? . The milkshakes were awesome though! I would go just for the milkshake and the ability to watch football on one of their large screen tv's.. Overall 2.5 stars but, milkshake brought it up to a 3. The ambience is fine. The drinks cold! The waitstaff nice. The service was fine as well. Our burgers were undercooked but they quickly remedied the situation.. Probably will not return as there are way too many choices for a meal!
We went on a Saturday night, they don't accept reservations but you can put your name in and they will text you when your table is ready. Or you can wait in line. Our wait was about an hour, but we played roulette until it was ready. The burgers were excellent and the truffle fried were to die for. I had the American burger, yummy! The husband had farm burger and loved it. Be aware the fries are a lot, you cane easily share them. The waiters were nice and the ombiance was casual and nice.
Hands down the best burger I ever tasted ... I had ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and the truffle fries sooooo good ! Service was great . Better get there early because it will be a line outside the door . Great experience . I will be going back :)
First off the ambiance was breath taking without completely killing the wallet. The staff was amazing and professional. Be prepared to chose your favorites! The fries had 2 sauces, the onion rings had 2 sauces and every burger has a variety of toppings. There was quite a wait for a burger place but my husband and I understand cause after all it is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant; but that being said it was about a 30-45 min wait which really wasn't that bad. I would recommend the truffle parmesan fries which on there own is amazing but the sauces will make you keep eating when you're full.
I can't say anything stood out taste wise, but it was certainly pretty presentation. Honestly didn't even like the taste of my burger (I would say In&Out probably tasted better). I had a bite of the dirty dawg, it was good but way too salty. We ordered a few appetizers to share and they were good. But again, nothing super stood out where you couldn't get at your local diner. . . This is what we ordered:. Wings: good, a lil spicy but good. . Truffle onion rings: good. It didn't taste too truffle though. . Sweet potatoes fries: okay. American burger with a fried egg on top: not too good. . Dirty dawg: pretty presentation, a lil too salty.
Went here for dinner around 6:30-7PM. Short line for parties of 2 so we were able to get seated in about 20 minutes.. . We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, the Farm Burger, Truffle Parmesan Fries and the  Shake #5. Everything, especially the fries and shake, were so so so yummy! I would definitely recommend coming here for a casual dinner in Vegas.. . Minus 1 start because it took awhile to get our food after we ordered.
Delicious!  Will definitely be back on our next visit. Sad we waited so long to try it. Had the Hell's Kitchen burger and totally recommend!  Husband had the chili dawg...awesome and not what you think. Go for the truffle fries:)
I am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsey and pretty much watch all of his tv shows, so you can imagine my excitement to finally try some of his food. This was my girlfriends first time in Vegas we flew in early to do a little site seeing and then got to BurGR about 20 minutes before they opened, lucky for us the first ones in line, the line continued to grow until it was almost wrapped onto the casino floor. First impression was great, we were greeted by the 5 different hostesses working that morning and seated immediately upon opening. The server was very friendly and since we had been staring at the menu for some time we knew exactly what we wanted. I ordered the Farm Burger with duck breast bacon and a fried egg, my girlfriend ordered the Euro Burger with a sharing side of truffle fries. Wait time was minimal for our food and everything was cooked perfectly. The farm burger is by far the best burger that I have ever had, complimented with the delicious duck bacon I cannot imagine another burger tasting any better than this. The truffle fries and Euro Burger were also very good, we definitely got our money's worth. Side note the burgers are only 7 ounces but trust me when I say it will be plenty of food, I went into a food coma shortly after and had to walk around the strip to take off the extra weight. I come to Vegas about twice a year so I am hoping to experience this place again soon!
Best burger EVER! Had the Hell's Kitchen burger and Jalepeno Poppers. The poppers were really spicy ( and I like really HOT food) and I have not a single complaint about either one. Will probably be stopping by every time I'm in Vegas.
Believe what you've read about the wait. 25 minutes for a group of 3 on a Wednesday night. It was worth it.  The service was very good. Our server paid attention to refills and brought things out at the right times. . . I tried the onion rings, which really are as good as people say. They come with two sauces and the parmesan garlic one is great. I also had the Hells Kitchen burger. That was fantastic. I didn't finish it all because I wanted to try the fries (very good) and shared dessert with my table. We had the push up pop things, which are good and special because I've never had them anywhere else, but they were also not something I would order again. Their shakes are good. It was odd to see a layer of pudding on top, but it worked. . . I thought that the prices were reasonable for a celebrity chef's restaurant on the strip, about $14 or so for a burger.
The burgers were fabulous, the onion rings were out of this world and the service was terrific!  Lunch hour on a Monday the wait was only a few minutes and the first comment from the hostess was 'thanks for waiting'. Can't wait to return to try something else on the menu. Already recommended the restaurant to family and friends.  This is a MUST Burgr Experience!
Great Farm Burger, this is a must. Also the sweet potatoe fries are to die for...  they are AMAZING!!!!!!
