St Francis is one of those places that once you find it, you love it! We were told to eat there by a friend and we are so glad we did! We loved the decor, the wait staff and the food. We have visited Phoenix twice in the last few weeks and ate there both times. The baker's bread, which you can purchase by the loaf, is wonderful as well as the entree's. We loved the fact that the menu changes due to seasonal ingredients. We will definitely go back!
I got the special which was some sort of salmon risotto dish.  It was decent but nothing special.  My friend and some others got the Pig Dip sandwich, which they raved about and the fries that came with it were good!  I also got the Cucumber Cooler which was light and refreshing!  I really like the ambience and the feel of the place and I'd definitely go back and try some of the other dishes!
The food was good. The service was good. We would definitely come back to try other items on the menu. We weren't super impressed with the selection of food. Cool vibe, though.
The space is rustic, modern, and chic. It was also open and inviting. Great bustling spot for brunch. I made a reservation via OpenTable and after a few minutes of watching the hostess fumble around, she said she located our reservation and we were taken to our table. (Side note: later that day, I received an e-mail from OpenTable informing me that I was a "no show"). . Our experience started out nice enough with prompt service, however, while we were eating, we could not find our server. Our waters and coffees were empty and we were desperate for refills. When we finally spotted her, we could not get her attention. She tended a couple other tables, then stood at the server station while flirting with another server. It was infuriating. Especially with other wait staff walking around the restaurant and no assistance. Do colleagues not help each other? We finally got her to refill our beverages. My mom also requested additional sugar packets for her coffee, however, our server just went about her business, so we finally had to flag down another server and he kindly brought us more. A couple minutes later, she drops off a whole container without a word.. . Thank goodness the food was tasty!. . Cheddar Herb Scone ($5): The scone is a daily selection and I'm very pleased with the one we had. It was delicious! Great texture and flavors. I'm a huge fan of savory scones and this is definitely one of the best ones I've had. I was tempted to order another one if it wasn't for the price tag.. . Cinnamon Roll with caramel sauce ($6): This is HUGE! And importantly, delicious. I really liked the caramel sauce that was fortunately not too sweet. We couldn't even finish half of it, so we took it home and it made a nice snack.. . Crispy Fingerling Potatoes ($11): Tossed with rosemary, sage, and Parmesan; served with lemon aioli. The potatoes were delightfully crispy with tender interiors. I loved the flavors of the fresh, fragrant herbs and salty, nuttiness from the Parmesan. The aioli was also a great compliment. My mom and I love potatoes and we were really digging this dish!. . Farmer's Market Frittata ($10): A thin "pancake" of eggs is topped with market fresh vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, tomato, mushroom, baby spinach), sun-dried tomato, pickled red onion, and cheddar. I was really disappointed with this dish. Pan-fried eggs with vegetables tossed on top is NOT a frittata. Even if I ignored the name, it was flavorless and boring! The vegetables were barely heated through. Silver lining: It's a great low-carb option. Just pretend it's called Vegetable Medley & Eggs.. . Chorizo Scramble ($10): Eggs with chorizo, spinach, salsa, and jack cheese. Served with a slice of Brick Oven Baguette. This was tasty. Solid brunch choice for those that like it a little spicy. Ruben really enjoyed it.. . Chicken Chopped Salad ($14): Mixed greens, avocado, dates, almonds, and medium-boiled egg. My mom and I both loved this salad! The dressing was light and flavorful, but not overpowering. Everything was fresh and I loved the crunch from the almonds. A very generous serving of chicken as well.. . We also took home two Brick Oven Baguettes ($3/each) - bonus: they're Vegan! They seem to have a sourdough aspect? They have a great crust like that on my favorite pizzas.. . The food was (mostly) really great, however, our experience left much to be desired. It's truly a shame. I'm not sure any of us would be excited to return.. . FYI: Complimentary valet only. Really odd considering the lot is very small and when we retrieved our car, he handed us the key since it was so close to the restaurant and exit. So very odd. Anyway, I felt so bad for the valet because it was SO hot outside!
Good food. Valet only. Far too loud inside. Had to yell and repeat myself constantly to a person just 3ft away.. And had to cup my ear to hear others.. One of the bench tables has no back - so you get to either bump into the people in back of you or lean far forward into your table.. Bar is very small.. Won't be back.. Too bad. The food is pretty good.
I have been here a couple of times and always like what I get. The salmon is really nice.
Great food! I really like the French onion burger! It was amazing! This place is a must! I come here often and am never disappointed. Great place for a business lunch or date night.
I am the foodie of the family and my Dad is the one who introduced me to this restaurant.  It was a great addition to the Central & Camelback area that was overrun with chains.. . It is a little bit new, a little old, and cool all at the same time.  I keep trying to get there for happy hour because I know that the bar how that feature where they can open the door to the outside which I love.  I've had the omelette for breakfast which was fabulous and I recently went there for lunch and they also had a breakfast sandwich on the menu.  Not your ordinary sandwich for sure and it was so good. . . Let me preface by saying that they are part of the slow cooking food movement which means that your food is fresh.  I never liked food from other places being prepped so much that is was rushed out before you even finished your salad or appetizers.  Take your time, have a drink and enjoy the atmosphere.
Had an awesome happy hour early dinner.  Great deals on the menu.   Had an ice cold Hefe beer... and split a french onion burger and salad.  Super yummy all around.. . Waitress and staff were all over the service and our water cups were full at all times.  Service doesn't get any better than this.. . Great ambience and people watching to boot.
This place is all I thought it would be, DELICIOUS. The ambiance is cool laid back and fresh. They have an Urban contemporary feel, but somehow rustic in nature. . . Wife had the baked tomatoes and I had the pancake. I recommend sharing whatever you get as the pancake is really RICH, you need to cut it with something savory. Also be sure to add a side of meat if you select these two options. . . Sundays live Jazz brunc from 10:30am - 1:30pm, well worth it! I recommend the upstairs balcony seating overlooking the bar area (#greatpeoplewatching) For the guys going, there is a tv in the bar but most seats don't face it. . . Overall I give them 4 stars for my Sunday Brunch experience. We will visit again for dinner to see the night time Swag!
Cool style, great service, and delicious food. I had a cold when I went and the waitress went out of her way to bring me hot tea and honey. Try the fingerling potatoes and the iron skillet pancakes.
First visit with friends who had been here before. Even knowing the address it was a challenge to find as we drove into a setting sun. Once in the parking lot the complimentary valet parking took over and did a good job welcoming us. It happened to be restaurant week and we chose the three course menu. My wife had to have the pumpkin soup and loved it. I started with Brussels sprouts and chorizo risotto and it was good. The pork my wife had was good and the scallops I had were great. The panacotta was good and the sticky pudding was good too. The albarino wine went well with my dinner. Service was excellent. Somehow it still took 1.75 hours for dinner. Price for dinner for two on the three course restaurant week dinner with wine for one including tax and tip was $115 which is reasonable, I suppose but not "bargain city".
I've only been for breakfast and they try to get fancy with it. Nothing wrong with that but it just didn't taste right.. . I'll review them again once I try their dinner.. . Also, it's super hard to get a seat of you don't have a dinner reservation and it's valet parking only.
We went here specifically because of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives from Food TV.  We even got the Pig Dip that they featured on the show.  It was everything they claimed and more. Cooked perfectly. Amazing pork.  I'm not a fan of mustard, but it was perfect on this sandwich. We also had an appetizer of baked goat cheese. Wow. Delicious. Nice crowd, a little loud and would go back again in a minute. Highly recommend!
Delicious food & lovely ambience. The Moroccan meatballs are out of this world! Delish...
I was telling a friend about this place, and realized I never reviewed it. I couldn't get rwifi eception on my phone when I was dining there. The food was fabulous and the portions great! I had the burger which was so incredibly delicious and mouth watering. I also tried the flatbread with the smoked salmonand that was amazing :-) I went there during happy hours, because I hate to pay retail and love a good deal. lol!  must be the Jew gene!
