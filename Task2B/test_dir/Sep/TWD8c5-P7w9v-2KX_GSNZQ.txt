Exemplary service with amazing pools! Clean, rooms smell really good like Mangoes or tropically. . They have 2 starbucks which is a super bonus but they have higher prices, understandable since it's Vegas.  I highly recommend going to Border Grill and to Citizens for some fantastic eats. . Lots of pool choices and the strawberry mojitos are so refreshing for 108 heat.  . Toptional pool for those Euros!
We stayed here for the weekend. we enjoyed it very much. The hotel has many great amenities including wave pool, lazy river,  spa services, & room services. Loves the Hotel decor -feels refreshing with mamy water flows and trees having the tropical taste. There are many great restaurants.  My most favs are stripsteak & Kuma among the few ones we tried. . Service was great. We had a great time. Will Come Back & Highly Recommend To all!
Pools. . My daughter loved the pools, when we weren't at the pool, she sat at the window andstared down at the pool.  The alarms were set, so she could be the first in the lazy river.  I'm surprised that her whole body didn't look like a prune.  She wants to move to Las Vegas and didn't allow me to return the room key, so she can return to the pool.. . The room was nice, king size bed, a bunch of TV channels (no Disney tho).  The bathroom was large.  It had tub, shower and separate toilet.  The oddity for me, was the window next to the tub.  It was positioned so that anybody entering/exiting the room or the adjoining room could see the bather.  There also wasn't any locks on the bath area.  All not a big deal for adults, but could provide a challenge for those with children.. . For meals, we mainly ate elsewhere.  The menus in house, were a bit to pricey for me, $19 for a California Roll is too much.  Valet was free and easy, so for us, that was the best option.  After the pools closed, one time I was allowed to gamble a little bit.... . Pretty sure I'll be back - I've heard there are pools there  :)
The Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel, our tower room was large and comfortable, and we even had a TV in the large bathroom, and a separate glass-enclosed shower and separate tub. The pool area is fun, with a huge wave pool and a pool bar. We also like the Casino which has tall ceilings and elegant bars through out it. Also, there are plenty of shops to walk to at The Shoppes at Mandalay Place and there is a convenient tram that you can take for free that will stop at Luxor and Excalibur.
They did right by me and gave me a refund for the resort fee. Because we didnot use the resort.  Thank you.
Very nice hotel and the pool area was amazing. The staff was super nice and was able to check us in early. I like that the hotel was not dark and gloomy like the others and the decor was very beautiful. I am planning to do my bachelorette there in the near future. Can't wait!
I've been lucky enough to stay at the Mandalay Bay as a gift from my parents both times. . . The hotel itself maintains a really relaxing spa like atmosphere and despite the fact that it's near the end of the strip you're still within walking distance of a lot of things. . . The accommodations themselves have always been wonderful. Clean beds, clean bathrooms and a friendly staff. . . We spent a bit of time by the pool (though in the summer it's almost worth it to pay the exorbitant cabana fees) and lounging in the lazy river. . . The casino is very nice and quiet compared to others too, which I'm kind of into cause I guess I'm into that sort of thing.
Well it is hard to review such a huge establishment but here we go.  First I love the Polynesian theme and the smell inside the casino.  Next I love the shops at Mandalay Bay.  The rooms are very nice and the restaurants as a whole are also all very good (make sure you try burger bar within the shops at Mandalay bay).  Ok now onto gambling.....well as a serious gambler (table games only) I would probably look elsewhere.  If you like blackjack the games are not favorable due to the rules they have plus many tables are continuous shuffle.  The baccarat room is fine but most tables are not going at any given time.  The sports book is pretty decent.  The Michael Jackson show is amazing.  Shark reef is fun for kids.  The pool has a beach with perfect wave pool to body surf or at least learn how.  Check it out.....it has a cool vibe.....very house of blues esque!
Wonderful property and amazing pool area. It is not inexpensive, but typical for the strip. . . Unfortunately the room AC fan has a serious issue.  Every time it came on it would squeal loudly. I tried various fan speeds couldn't find a way that it wouldn't intermittently squeal. Eventually I turned the whole thing off which made for a very warm night. . . This morning I showed the front desk a video of the issue and they put in a repair order and said they would have it looked at.  No real apology. No timeframe.  I guess I expected more in an industry that prides itself on an amazing experience.  Granted, I'm tired. What a very long night right before a very busy conference.. . Update:  Issue was resolved.  However there was no apology, no follow-up, and a real lack of empathy for the situation.  You truly are one of the masses that come and go without notice.  I'll probably stay here again, but not on my dime.
I got the room for $69.00 just for playing my Vegas i was worth the price and had the pool veiw
We came here to get a cabana and hang out by the pool for my birthday...... . They don't support the military or veterans as they do not offer a discount for anything at the pool which is disappointing.  However, with that being said, we got one and the service was just ok.  They were great at coming around immediately when we arrived and really have a desire to push food and drink on you.  Once you order they do come around pretty often when you don't need them to check up on you, however when you need them they are nowhere to be found.... . The wave pool was fun and the lazy river was very relaxing when you can avoid the kids.  The regular pool was not bad, this area was not crowded and the water was nice.. . Would I go here again, probably as it was a relaxing afternoon, but you really have to watch because the prices change  for the cabana's depending on the days of the week.  . . As for the people who take care of you once in the cabana, they promised us a cord for our phones and forgot to bring it.  So, overall I would rate the service as ok, they were not horrible, but they were far from fantastic.
I scored an awesome deal through Southwest for flight and hotel and got a king sized suite and giant bath tub in it for around $90/night. Our room was phenomenal, bed comfy, TV kind of a pain to work but we didn't watch it often. The bathroom was great. I've never had a bad experience here. The staff is great and very friendly. Everything is kept in pristine condition. The casino area doesn't smell like a smokers paradise as opposed to when we stayed at the Luxor where all of the cigarette smoke in there nearly caused my throat to swell when we stayed lastMay. The shark aquarium isn't the greatest and they don't have many options for food besides the buffet and the small food court they have, but they're doing renovations on that area so they may be adding more. I'll absolutely stay again and again
Came here in July! Super nice hotel. Very elegant and clean. Only downside is they have no fridge!
The pool is by far the best on the strip , unfortunately the location of the hotel is far from everything , the do have the tram but I prefer walking .
Made reservations a month ahead of time to get the suite my wife wanted with a view of the strip,called back and confirmed. $1,200.00 later had a dirty room ,tv in bathroom with tub didnt work ,lamp beside bed didnt work,tall lamp by window didnt work.Went to casino for buffet,TONS of food ......ALL COOLLDDD!! At time oc checkout they tried to charge us for items we ate in room when we explained we didnt,the lady at checkout said"the items are on a weight sensative scale on the dresser and sent somebody up to check,she did take off the charge,after 20 mins almost missed our 6am flight having to get to airport at 4am . TERRIBLE  will never go back worse stay in Vegas
Overall really nice hotel. Nice rooms, beds average. The have a great selection of restaurants with many world class chefs here. The pool is one of the best of you are looking for large space and wave pool for kids. The only complaint is drinks as with many hotels in Las Vegas have got extremely expensive, Red Bull $ Goose $21, makers $19, and espresso Martinis $18, just to name a few. I will definitely come back as it is very convenient with all the different restaurant options...boiler room is a must!!!
Good pool, clean room, good service. From the other reviews I've read on here, it sounds like we may have gotten lucky with our room. We stayed for two nights in a Spa Suite and I found it to be very pleasant. The room was large and the bathroom had a large soaking tub with a television in the mirror. We didn't get a great view (the back side of the Luxor/freeway) but we didn't get a "strip view" room so I didn't expect much. They put a random $200 charge on our debit card, so beware of that. However, we went back down to the lobby and they took it off immediately and waived one of our resort fees. The staff was generally friendly and we were able to check-out from our hotel room. Take advantage of express check-out, huge time saver. Room prices similar to other middle range hotels on the Strip, not amazing, but not bad.
HURT ON PROPERTY AND THEY DONT FOLLOW UP OR CARE:: 7 of us chose to stay at Mandalay Bay for my 40th Bday weekend.  We chose to stay here as we had heard this is the best pool in Vegas.  On the second morning of our trip my mother was entering the wave pool and was knocked down by the wave.  There were 14 lifeguards in the pool and NOT ONE OF THEM came to her aid until I got to her and yelled for help.  Had this been a child this situation could have ended much worse.  From there it just got worse.  She was on the verge of passing out and puking and no one acted like they knew what to do--.  Eventually the fire crew and ambulance showed up and took over thank goodness.  Why would you have 14 lifeguards who i observed later standing and talking to each other vs watching people in the pool. If they had came to her aid sooner the next wave may not have hit her and made her injury worse.  She spent 6 nights, 7 days in the hospital and we were not contacted by the hotel once while I continued to sleep there(though not enjoying anything else since I spent most of my days at the hospital).  When i went to check out I asked for a discount and to remove the resort fee charge since I was hardly there to enjoy the amenities and the answer was shockingly NO.  No apology or sympathy for what my mother or I were going through.  They then turned it over to Risk Managament which finally called my mom 5 days later and all I can say is they are nothing but rude.  When I spoke with her she said the lifeguards are only trained to pull people from the pool and have no other training..REALLY??? she also said if she was my mothers age she wouldn't have entered that pool..but in the end they are claiming no liability...nothing offered for what she has went through.  She had to spend another week in a hotel until she was mobile and had enough strength to travel back to Minnesota.  They said it would take 30 days to do their investigation and there is video of the pool area.  I would love to get my hands on that and prove the negligence of the pool staff.  The hotel is saying they can do nothing if anything until this investigation is complete but what ever happened to people caring?  is it just cause that isn't how we would treat people in the midwest??  . So beware, once they have you there and get your money they don't care what happens to you.. We had pool view, which i wouldn't recommend if you want any sleep.  Bass and music till 1 am one morning and 3 am the next!
We came to vegas this past weekend for my friends bachelorette party so we decided to stay at Mandalay.  The rooms are fairly nice and clean, but we found some BBQ sauce or blood on the ceiling of our room.  Since it was in the ceiling it wasn't that big of a deal.  . . The bathrooms are amazing cause it's huge so for 3 girls it was great!  The beds are soft and comfy.  The pillows could be a little fluffier but it's better than other places.. . The pools are nice.  They have a lazy river so that's fun. And a beach club that's for adults and top optional.. . I would stay here again.  . . The only thing I would complain about is the location cause it's so far so lots of taxis.  But if you don't mind walking they have a free tram that goes straight to Excalibur
On September 28, 2014, A few of us girls got together in Las Vegas, Nevada. We decided to stay at the Mandalay Bay located at 3950 S. Las Vegas Blvd. Las Vegas, Nevada. We were given room 21128 for the night. We did not check into the room until about 1 AM. While unpacking and getting ready to go out, one of our shoes got kicked under the bed that was near the bathroom door. While looking for the shoe, I touched something under the bed. When I pulled my hand back out and looked I realized what I had touched was a condom that was left under the bed.  I washed my hands and finishedgetting ready because I was furious. I took a picture of the condom. We left the room for about an hour. When we came back to the room, I called the front desk so it could be picked up by housekeeping. The woman I spoke to at the front desk sent security up to the room. The security officer who came up refused to come in and pick up the condom that was left there. I asked him to look at the picture of it, but he refused to look at the picture. I went and got my phone anyway so I could show him the picture that was taken. The security guard left, leaving the condom still under the bed. I called the front desk again around 7:30AM or 8:00.  The condom was now under the bed during our whole stay at the Mandalay Bay. When I spoke to the front desk, I asked to speak to a manager. I spoke to Jeremy. Jeremy and a woman came up to the room at almost 9AM to pick up the condom. During that time I told him about everything that had happened. The woman who was with him who I am assuming was the head of housekeeping was smiling and smirking like the situation was a joke or funny.  During the conservation about when the corporate office would be calling, the woman told me they would eventually get in contact with me and it would be taken care of.  I let Jeremy know how dirty and germ infested a condom is considering all the bodily fluids and bacteria that was on there, since no one knows how long it was actually under the bed. Jeremy was very unconcerned about that He said well they picked it up. That was after I had touched the condom. He said that someone from their office will get in contact with me eventually. I proceeded to tell him I was going to be contacting the BBB and the Health Department because this is unacceptable. He told me he would contact the corporate office and they would call me. I still have no received a call back from the corporate office. I called the corporate office myself and the woman I spoke to said someone would call me back, but she didn't know when. I called the Mandalay Bay to confirm that Jeremy had sent over what had happen to them so they knew what was going on. He was not in the office today, so I spoke with another woman who said she was a manager. I believe her name was Amanda. She told me since we checked out and the condom was picked up the issue was resolved and there was nothing she can do for me. I proceed to tell her the story that security refused and it was there for almost 5 hours with their employee's knowledge. She was very rude and did not want to do anything.
Valet attendant Zach was terrible! We pulled up to fix an issue with our reservation, the entire valet was empty and he demanded that we show him our reservation email and then on top of it a tip to keep our vehicle in valet. He was so unfriendly and made our first impression of Mandalay bay a terrible one. Upon returning to the car I told him I thought he was rude and he said "ha! Ok".. I told him I've lived here for 5 years and have never experienced such rude behavior from a valet attendant and he proceeded to look at me up and down and say "I've lived here my whole life, sorry honey". I just was completely appalled. I have always loved Mandalay bay but have never felt so disrespected by a valet attendant.
