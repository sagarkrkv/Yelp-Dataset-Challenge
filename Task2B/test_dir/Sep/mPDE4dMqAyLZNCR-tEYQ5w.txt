Worst show in Vegas. I come from a small town and like visiting the big city to see the sights, but this was a waisted night. Love is a much better show (almost worth the trip to vegas)! I havent seen any other shows in Vegas yet, but the premise of KA is that the story line is boring, people are just speaking gibberish (no talking the entire time), tons of spinning and dancing with sticks, one-two scenes of typical acrobatics, and an awkward video/cartoon movie randomly plays instead of real people. But to their credit some people in the audience actually stood up to clap and a lot of people liked it. Terrible taste in my opinion. Nothing original the entire time.
Loved the show. Hated the concessions.  I was upset because I paid $500 for two tickets.  For this amount of money all I wanted was to enjoy the show and more importantly the experience.  However the sound of a giant bucket of popcorn being consumed next to me was a distraction.  The crunching and knawling at her giant bucket made me want to vomit.  Yes the lady also licked her fingers.   . . I understands that shows are expensive but I consider it a travesty that concessions sell barrels of popcorn to be crunched while I try to enjoy the show.  For me the experience was compromised.  . . As stated the show was very nice, but it will be my last Cirque du Soleil,  I just wouldn't feel comfortable paying for another show and running into the same experience.  . . When is charging enough....enough?  Does popcorn really go with such a show?  What next in this shameless fleecing of the public. How about big buckets of Nachos with liquid cheese to go with the show.  And don't forget your beer hat that holds 40 ounces of your favorite Cirque du Soleil beer.  Now to show your appreciation you must have a Cirque du Soleil bugle and big foam #1 finger.  Because they can't expect you to be able to lift yourself out of the seat to clap.
Amazing show. Probably one of the best Cirque shows I've been to. I saw a few other shows while in Vegas and this made up for the so-so ones we saw the same weekend. There is a story line and excitement. I would recommend this show to everyone. I would also recommend NOT drinking a 32 oz redbull vodka before the show because you definitely will have to use the restroom in the middle of the show!
Great experience. Amazing show! Great for dates and families! The special-effects where exciting.. The stage was crazy!! I couldn't tell you how many stages they had.. . The customer service was Second to none!!
This is my first Cirque Du Soleil show, so I didn't know what to expected.. . From the first moment the show started I was thoroughly impressed.  The music, scenery, and costumes were incredibly.  I found myself enthralled and deeply moved by what was going on.  A couple times I practically jumped out of my seat because of what was going on.  I even though a performer was going to be dropped on me!. . However, the reason it's only three stars is the final fight scene.  I understand something tragic happened that required them to change what was done.  But that was also a year ago.  They are still going with the horrible looking video.  I couldn't tell who was fighting or anything.  It ruined the huge buildup and was a big letdown.  Again, I know something horrible happened when this was done originally.  But they could have easily changed it by now.. . It's a great show and will be perfect once they fix that one gripe I have.  I suggest you find a different Cirque Du Soleil show that has each part actually done live.
Let me preface this by saying it's not a terrible show, and would be great for taking an entire family to (if you can afford it). It's like many things in Vegas, and is way overpriced for what it is.. . First, some of the acrobatics were great, of course, but nothing I haven't seen at significantly cheaper carnivals and other shows. Sure, they had lots of energy, and I know it's a lot of work, but there wasn't a whole lot of actual talent, which is what I expected to see; this is Vegas, this is supposed to be top-shelf talent, and you can't even get some peopel who can actually shoot a bow and arrow?. . It's a very 'busy' show, so I think for many that's all it needs to be in order to be entertained, but if you focused on the individuals, most weren't really doing much. Wow, you can play catch (and drop it a few times), not very impressive. . . The story was kinda hacky, and the performers themselves aren't mic'd so its like watching a TV show in the Sims 3: cheezy, pointless, and lots of gibberish. The fat lady was completely unnecessary; we get it, fat people are helpless and should be laughed at, but come on, it's an ongoing joke throughout the entire show.. . As for the show's storyline, it basically involved the fat lady matriach of a clan, two men-women (women dressed as men) fall in love to quell the spat between two lands, and pirate dudes crash the party and capture one of the man-woman. King of the pirates wants his daughter to marry, then the Fu-manchu dude presents his emo son to said daughter. Emo dude's special talents include whipping his hair back and amateur pyrotechnics, emo dude then gives the daughter a baton they pretend is a flute for some reason. Some bullshit goes on with some of the original tribes being lost, pointlessly annoying giant bugs and crabs pop up on the beach and take up 20 minutes of time for some stupid reason. Pirate king's daughter falls in love with the man-woman, and gives him the flute-baton for some reason. He plays it for a minute. She then does a baton routine with said flute (which was pretty decent actually). Eventually, the two men-women are reunited, fu manchu dude had a plan to take over all the tribes, some 'war' footage is displayed in terrible quality, then they do a happy dance. Oh, then they'll do real fireworks, which sounds cool, but super bright white light in a pitch-black theatre does what? Oh yeah, it freaking blinds you, so you can't even see it. So f*cking stupid.. . As for the actual good parts in the show, the platform was pretty awesome and took some creative engineering. There were hints of actual talent with the baton routine, the hamster cages (you'll see), and the sparkling dude on the corde lisse, and the sets were designed pretty well. But it was also kinda amateurish, I've seen much more impressive acrobatics done by far cheaper acts, and the focus on a lot of stupid bs like the crab and giant centipede, that took up like over 10 minutes of pointlessness, totally made for any 5 year olds in the audience I suppose.. . We got pretty decent deals ($100/ea, nicely-centered seats in the middle of the arena which are definintely the best seats in the house), but still feel like it was a waste of money.
I saw Ka 4 years ago and was blown away! It became my second favorite (Mystere is my fave) until I saw it for the second time last night and became very depressed over the changes that were made. I wish I had not gone to see it again. The Firefly boy dancing with the Princess among the trees was completely cut. This could have easily been converted from a swinging aerial act to a real dance. It would have conveyed the love story between those 2 characters and not have you question why the Princess chooses to marry him after you assume he saves her.. Then the final battle.... Yes, I know a performer died accidentally a little over a year ago, but the battle projected on the wall was unacceptable. It did not look right and it was difficult to tell what was happening. Again, this could have been reworked to make the action take place on a horizontal surface than the vertical one.. Please make some changes, choreographers! Make this the spectacle it once was instead of the joke it has become.
I didn't really like this one. We have been to lots of shows in Las Vegas, but this one was my least favorite. The theatre was really awesome, but the show was not that good. Probably worth going to if you can't find tickets to other shows.
We got 2 for 1 tickets at MyVegas rewards (an online game). We had "premium" seats in the fifth row, seats one and two. It would have been better to sit a little further back because for most of the show, those of us in the very close rows had to tilt our heads back to see what was happening in the air above us, or twist our heads all the way to the sides to see what was happening on the side walls of the theater. . . So far, the Cirque shows we have seen are Love, Mystere, and Michael Jackson, but KA was by far the worst. The show is incredibly long and unbelievably boring. The show consisted mostly of fake fighting and baton twirling. You won't really see any of the awesome stunts that Cirque is known for. . . The big finale was cut out since the death of one of the performers and replaced by a big screen showing a movie of what the finale used to look like. This should be removed from the show altogether because not only was it anti-climactic, but all I could keep thinking was "this is how that girl died, this is how that girl died." This made me very sad.
Probably one of the best Cirque Du Soleil show I've ever seen (I also loved Iris). the stage decor was amazing! The characters and props were stationed around the audience, so it made us feel apart of the show. My only complaint was the battle scene part. I understand a staff member had an unfortunate incident last year, but they could have done the battle scene on solid, flat ground. I thought the projection of the battle scene now is boring and hard to follow. My BF and I were whispering to each other about WTH is going on... other than that, it was worth every penny!
When I was younger, seeing a cirque du soleil show in Vegas was never a priority until I finally had the opportunity, a few years back, to experience "The Beatles Love" show. After that, we decided to try to check out as many shows as possible. This would be my 3rd show and I must say, this was the most action packed out of the other two. . . Right when you walk in to the auditorium the place just looks like something crazy is about to go down. They have this big pit at the front of the stage that's spitting up fire. Strange ninja like warriors come out and start looking and crawling around the audience while people are getting situated. Our seats were located in the front of the middle section but in the very last row for disability purposes. My girl had a roll out seat which made it very easy to get in and out of her seat with a broken leg. . . The staff was VERY helpful and attentive to her needs and even gave us better seats than what we originally paid for. After the show, one of the workers followed us out and even stopped traffic so we could get out of the building quickly. We thought that was a very nice gesture.. . As for the show, we loved the creative use of the stage and the stunts performed in this show the best. In Love, your more captivated by the music that goes along with the stuns and the visuals. Here you are untangled in this fascinating story that takes place with these amazing transitions used by the stage in various ways, creating these illusions that blow your mind at times. There are a few slow and simple parts but I believe those were transitions to set things up for something epic.. . Overall, I would definitely recommend KA to my friends and if the price was right, I'd see it again. Great Job!. . OOOOO. 5 out of 5 Afros
The best cirque show I've ever seen. I've seen mystere and zarkana in LV and two in NY. The set is very detailed and amazing! The stage can rotate and transform to a backdrop. They have an age limit if 5 if you want to bring your little ones. They do question them at the door. . The soundtrack is beautiful too. I definitely recommend this to everyone. They merge technology and art in the most mind blowing ways.
While the costumes were great, the show not so much. It didnt have a lot of true cirgue du soleil stuff.  Mostly dancing and some martial arts. It was quite boring and I fell asleep a couple of times.  Also, the last scene where they just show the video is so lame. I realize that the performer died last year but they had plenty of time to create a new scene.  It was more like a play, not Cirgue Du Soleil. I heard great reviews from people that saw it years ago. I didnt realize that this show was changed to remove most Cirgue Du Soleil stuff.  Lame and overpriced!
The No1DP was in Vegas earlier this year and saw this Cirque production along with "O". He liked both but he loved Ka so much that the next time we were in Vegas he'd take me here. True to his word, this was one of his surprises.. . Showtimes Tues-Saturday in the MGM Grand. It's a big show floor but coming from the main entrance (where all the cars stop for drop-offs and valet service) it was only a 5 minute walk to the theater entrance. The area in front of the theater has props that resemble the huts to the sides as you go inside. No1DP picked up his tickets at Will Call. . . Ticket prices are level with O and Beatles LOVE, which translates to "pretty damn expensive". There's different tiers with different pricesfor each tier. No1DP and I sat 8 rows from the front as this is actually in the same eye-level as the front of the stage. The very first rows are actually cheaper because the stage is slightly above eye level for those rows. According to the pricing guide where we sat was at least $150/person.. . Due to the horrendous taxi situation we got there around 9 minutes late so we missed the pre-show performance AND the opportunity to take photos with the set pieces. I also got to miss the best part of the show: the exhibition of the different martial arts that are involved with the story. No1DP mentions had we gotten there too late we wouldn't be allowed to be seated but the ushers were kind enough to seat us after the introduction sequence.. . What sets Ka from the other Cirque shows is that it tells an original story. The acrobatics and theatrics enhance the story, not the other way around. The story is easy to get even with no spoken dialogue. Ka goes for a fast 90 minutes with no intermission. All parts of the stage are used; No1DP pointed out action happening in the sides I would have missed if I kept my eyes to the center.. . The only disappointing part about the performance is the climax. One part of the production used to be live but a death occurred and as a result this scene is now projected into the wall. I was quite confused when I saw this and had to research after the fact to know what this was.. . The shop sold all sorts of memorabilia related to Ka and the other Cirque shows. Unlike a lot of memorabilia around Vegas the items inside the store look quite nice, especially the well-designed shirts. No1DP purchased the program guide which clarified a lot about the story.. . This brings my number of Cirque shows seen in Vegas to two. I'd definitely recommend this production to other people, especially if they have never seen a Cirque production before.
