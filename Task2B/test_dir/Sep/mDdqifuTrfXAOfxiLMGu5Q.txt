What a dr jekyll and mr hyde dining experience!. . We arrived about 8 minutes late to our 6:15 reservations.  our table wasn't ready yet so we were shown to the bar side / waiting area.. . First impressions,  Great decor, cool uniforms and very easy to tell who is a hostess, wait staff, bar tender, chef, etc.   I also noticed how loud it was in there..  just a tiny bit below the volume of a night club. . . I was there with my wife, 1.5 year old daughter, brother in law & mother in law .  the music turned up so loud it was hard to hear each other and hard to hear the staff.  we were given a tablet to looks at drinks . I couldn't hear what the hostess said about orders .. so we waited for someone to come over and take our drink orders.. but no one ever came. (maybe she said to order at the bar?). . a different hostess came into the bar / waiting area and said our table was ready.. . as we walked from the bar area to the dining area she said something about a cable car or train car? couldn't hear her over the music.   . . as we entered the dining area she told us about the cool neon artwork above us.. again I couldn't hear her. my wife who was next to the hostess had to repeat to all of us after we sat down what she said. (the lights are supposedly the hand movements of Gordon when he makes a wellington). . I was holding my daughter and I sat down. I was given a menu, then despite the fact that I had both hands full I was given the wine menu , which I had to set down immediately.  . . they gave my wife a tablet that had the drink menu on it. (tablet had to reboot before we could use it - no bigie). . everything on the menu sounded great lots of amazing options .   although I quickly zeroed in on all the steak choices .  after just a short bit a staff member came over with a steak cart. it has examples of all the amazing beef cuts.  there is prime, dry aged prime, and real wygu beef.  I really wanted to hear everything about the steaks ... but (bet you can guess) I could not hear him over the music .    . . the wait staff was very attentive and we had no problems ordering a dirty vodka marinti and a whisky sour..  both were very tasty, couldn't taste the alcohol..  I'm assuming its because they were mixed so well , and they were on the big side .  . . so the food we told the staff the Mac and cheese was for our daughter and please bring it out first.  they brought it out very quickly! the Mac and cheese was amazing, best I've ever had. my daughter loved it and we were all eating out of her bowl.    she also liked their yummy breads.  when we needed milk for her again it was easy to get tell a wait staff member who very quickly brought the milk.. . my wife had a seafood plate with various fish and shell fish. she loved it all. my mother in law got the sea bass and also loved it. . . my brother in law and I both had the bone in rib eye, medium rare.   the cook was dead one with a nice red and warm (not hot) center.  seemed seasoned well,. . crazy thing. the steak was tough and chewy.  ? it was juicy and had good flavor, but it was tough and almost had some grizzle on it.. ? very disappointing.   I wonder if they got a bad batch or just a few steaks were tough? felt more like a roast than a steak in terms of tough/chewiness . . my mother in law loved everything she eat, but said she wouldn't want to eat there again because of the loud music.  (house and top 40)  I actually really liked the music that was being played.. just not the volume.  . . I did mention that my steak was tough and they offered to refire and even change to a different cut.  which normally I would do, but there's only so long a toddler will behave NAD I didn't want to push our luck.   not to mention due to not being able to hear the wait staff my dining experience was already ruined. . . 355$ for 4 and a toddler.   I spent 280 for 2 at the mix a year ago so its actually a good value.  but I had a much better experience last year.  . . =/. . we have reservations for the Ramsay grill and pub so hopefully that will be a better experience.. . ** update**  I canceled my reservations for his pub and grill  due to my bad experience at his steak house and went to Bachi burger instead.
Chose to spend my birthday with Gordon Ramsay this year- dined with my BF and his father, in town for the holiday weekend. Food was satisfactory, some items were much better than others; service wasn't quite on par with restaurant price point or reputation.. . BREAD PLATE: Best start to a meal, ever. Three different varieties (lemon herb focaccia, a cinnamon roll-looking thing with prosciutto, and a crispy baguette-slice that tasted like straight-up cheese). All served with the best butter I've ever had, with black sea salt. Breads in order of deliciousness.. . FRENCH ONION SOUP: Skippable. Bouchon's is way better. This one has virtually no cheese but is quite rich, consistency more similar to a gravy than a soup. Very scant amount of onions in the bottom, mostly broth in our two orders.. . AMERICAN KOBE BEEF SLIDERS: Hyped for a reason, they're delicious. Cheese taste could be more pronounced but quality of meat was the star of this dish. Motivating me to hit up BurGR sooner than I'd planned.. . BONE IN RIB EYE: Large portion, great flavor, ordered medium due to table preferences but would have been much better medium-rare. Great crust, plated with a sauce that added just a bit of extra something to it.. . BEEF WELLINGTON: Had to try this at least once, underwhelmed. The pate didn't really complement the beef, quality of meat seemed lower in this dish than in others but glad I tried it. Least favorite dish of the night, actually.. . BEEF SHORTRIBS: Star of the night! Meaty, falling apart, packed a punch of flavor, plated with an amazing gravy sauce with mushrooms and spinach. Would definitely get this again, highly recommend.. . LOADED BAKED POTATO SIDE: Roughly the size of a football, too salty for me to really enjoy but the gouda was delicious and BF's dad really enjoyed it.. . MAC AND CHEESE: Shut the front door. This is my new favorite mac dish. I ate almost the entire dish, and I'll take the over on it being worth 5K calories. Worth it, see you at the gym! Didn't expect the peas in this dish but surprisingly didn't mind them.. . STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING: Another obligatory purchase, but this one was totally wroth it. I'm not a dessert person but this was downright decadent, delicious cake with toffee sauce and a fabulously light but flavorful ice cream. Bonus points for plating it with a candle for my special day.. . DRINKS: Interactive drink menu is on an iPad, underwhelmed by the cocktails but the Justin Paso Robles wine will go with absolutely any of the beef dishes here. If you're in more of a beer mood, the Oskar Blues Old Chub "Knightro" is flipping amazing.. . SERVICE: As I said, the service wasn't quite on par with the price point or reputation of the restaurant. Two drink orders were missed, and despite having an assistant helping out our server it seemed as if we were largely ignored for portions of the evening. Water levels, wait times, and such were not paid as much attention as expected.. . SEATING & DECOR: Highly recommend getting a booth seat next to the kitchen to be able to see the prep station, added extra level of entertainment. Cool bar set in a tube, red lighting fixture based on the arm motions to create GR's famous dessert, small touches that made this place stand apart. Side note, there are easily eight hostesses in black mesh club wear? Awkward costumes, entirely too many bodies in the front of the restaurant.
So looking forward to this anniversary meal with my wife and so disappointed! Great service but the scallop risotto and beef wellington we were so looking forward to was almost inedible. The standards we see on Hells Kitchen were not present tonight.
Omg what a amazing place.  Gf got the beef Willington..  Excellent.  I got the Wagu American rib cap...  Best piece of meat I've ever had.  . Sides need work.  We got the Mac n cheese and the creamed corn...  Nothing special.  Still 5 stars just for the meat and service. . Best sides I've had are at mastros steak house lobster mash and creamed corn.  If you combine Gordans steak and mastros side..  I  would be dangerous.
Echoing the "worth it".  Mighty expensive but you get what you pay for.  My filet was divine and the spinach and asparagus were perfect.  I never had better brussels sprouts in my life.  I saved room for the toffee pudding but I honestly could have done without it.. . Excellent service.  I was surprised to see many customers wearing shorts and t-shirts.  I would have expected this place to have a dress code, but apparently not.  Not on a weekday at least.
Gordon Ramsey needs to have this restaurant on his show Kitchen Nightmares!  My husband with another couple booked this reservation 3 months in advance since we have been excited to try this restaurant for 2 years. We arrived to our reservation on a high note from walking off a craps table with winnings near $1000, we were sad to walk away from the table but excited for dinner (should have stayed playing craps!) it took the waitress 5 minutes to greet us and offer the water selection which we selected tap. They have a tray of the cuts of meat they wheel around to explain our options that they stick in a corner to store rather than the cooler, while the waitress explained the different cuts all we could smell was rotten meat. We mentioned this to her and she admitted it should be placed in the cooler after being out for a few minutes and swapped with another but the staff doesn't have time for that. GROSS! We ordered oysters (excellent), french onion soup (excellent), crab soup (very bland) gnocchi (small and blah) as appetizers. Our dinner was a NY strip (average) filet(overcharred) short ribs(very fatty) lamb (tiny) with sides of Brussels (over seasoned) Mac n cheese (way to much truffle) chocolate layers (good but nothing special). Now we wait......and wait.....and wait.... For our server to get more water and the bill so we finally ask someone to get her attention. Oh, I forgot that now we learn we have been receiving $9 bottles of water (6 of them) remember we requested tap. So manager comes over and we only complain of the water and over truffled Mac n cheese which he apologizes and removes from the tab. So we go back to waiting.  Now I request another manager of which I explain the entire experience to (I NEVER complain as I understand the demand of the business but for this price and for what the restaurant is I am now disgusted) this manager continues to apologize and explain they appreciate the feedback and he is disappointed that we had a bad experience. He additionally took off the dessert. We were not looking for anything to be comped (just the water). So now we wait again for the tab with empty water glasses, after 5 minutes we ask another server to please bring us water. You would think with that being our biggest complaint you would hydrate your customer. I mean we only wanted FREE WATER! Nothing else free, on a $600 tab. We were all shocked that Gordon Ramsey allows a restaurant to run this way and serve the food they do.  I have since read other reviews and all seem similar to mine. Maybe it is time for Ramsey to read them.
Gordon Ramsay Steak is awesome!  Sometimes you are let down when you visit a Celebrity Chef Restaurant.  But not here.  The service is great, the restaurant is very hip and modern.  Don't get me wrong, the Steak was amazingly good.  But I have Steaks as good at Ruth's Chris.  But the best part of the meal was actually the sides and Homemade Breads they make.  And one of the best desserts I have ever had in my life was the Sticky Toffee Pudding with Brown Butter Ice Cream!  The Ice Cream is shaped like a Cube of Butter and is just packed with the most amazing flavor.  5 Stars for sure!!!
+ The Drifter: Bourbon, notes of ginger, bitters, just wonderful~ My hands were too small to hold the massive glass it was served in, but with a drink this tasty, you make it work!. + Beef Wellington: Muy delicioso. Not much I can say about this that hasn't already been said. It was my first time having a wellington of any sort, so I was worried it would come dry (how they cook the meat and the pastry perfectly together is beyond my realm of understanding), but my concerns quickly melted away with each wonderful bite. You're warned that it takes 45 minutes to come out, but I don't think we waited more than 15 minutes. . + Kobe Rib Cap: Ohhhhhhhh wow. I had no idea what a rib cap was until the server explained it. Imagine a ribeye. You've got that massive chunk of meat, sometimes with a bone attached. On the perimeter opposite of the bone, you've got the rib cap in all its buttery, tender glory. Loved this!! The server recommended the bone marrow sauce to go along with it. Honestly, it would've been perfectly fine on its own, but the sauce was delicious and decadent addition to every bite. . . The Brussel sprouts and Mushrooms we got to accompany the meal were good, but got too salty to finish at the end. . . I'm always a little worried about celebrity restaurants because I can certainly see the quality of food deteriorating over time simply since their name has gotten so big and less attention is paid to the food. Thankfully, that's not the case with Gordon Ramsay Steak!
My wife and I have been trying to hit celebrity chef restaurants when we are vacationing. Being fans of Hell's Kitchen and being in Vegas, we decided to try Gordon Ramsay Steak.. . While being taken to our seats, the hostess explained some of the reasons for the design. I had a little trouble hearing her, due to the music being so loud (not uncommon in a lot of casinos in Vegas). We had a nice table near the kitchen, so we could see much of what was going on in the restaurant. The restaurant was busy, tables were full and waiters were constantly moving.. . When the waiter brought the menus, we were also presented with a showing of several of the meats. Reviews had suggested the Rib Key, which I order along with a baked potato.. My wife had the duet of lamb and the creamed corn.. . My steak was amazing. It just melted in my mouth. My wife said it was some of the best lamb she had ever had.. . Our one real nitpick of the restaurant was the temperature. It was very warm. While we were near the kitchen, there didn't seem to be a lot of airflow where we were.. . We do highly recommend giving Gordon Ramsay Steak a try.
I've always wanted to eat at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants food and service was top-notch as to be expected my wife and I enjoyed oysters on the half shell appetizer the Kobe wagyu fillet mignon, bone marrow, pan seared foie gras and creamed  spinach for dessert we split one of his sticky toffee pudding's that came with some sort of butter ice cream that was ridiculously good dinner was very expensive as to be expected for this caliber of food my only complaint was the atmosphere could be a bit more intimate
This meal was disappointing, especially after the many good ones in the past.  Everything we ordered was off tonight. 2 of us had the spare rib and we both had the same disappointment. The meat was fatty and the glaze looked like paint. The spinach on the plate was tough and tasteless. The Mac and cheese was off tonight too. My wife didn't finish her filet. The music was too loud to have a conversation. Gordon needs to visit the kitchen.
My husband and I are Gordon Ramsey fans and even had the opportunity to dine at "Hell's Kitchen" two years ago.  So when we were in Vegas last weekend, we definitely wanted to check out his Steak restaurant.  We've already eaten at his Pub and it was fabulous!  . . Service: The service was excellent and our waiter was very attentive to us...as well as the three other tables right next to us. I also loved how our waiter brought out a whole cart of meat and explained in much detail each cut of meat and how it's prepared. It definitely adds a classy touch. . . Food: . -Smoked beef tartar: Beautiful presentation!!! The homemade potato chips were awesome! Definitely order this.... -Fried oysters: Again, the presentation was gorgeous. It came with 4 fried oysters with a yummy sauce and seaweed. I just wish there were more! . -Kobe steak: It was delicious and just melted in my mouth. . -Beef wellington: Honestly, I wasn't impressed with it. Maybe it's because we were sharing it and the waiter suggested we cut in half so it was brought on two plates? Potato puree was delicious. . -Baked potato: A huge potato that was velvety smooth! It was covered in cheese and had three pieces of thick bacon.  The waiter brought me extra sour cream! Seriously, this was an amazing potato and I have eaten A LOT of potatoes of all kinds, especially being an avid potato lover.  I would return just to eat the baked potato again! . -Mac and cheese with truffles: Nothing special, but I love mac and cheese!  Sadly, it had peas in it...and I hate peas! . -Sticky Toffee pudding: A traditional dessert that is a signature of Gordon Ramsay! And it did not disappoint! It was a creative presentation with a "stick of butter" with a knife in it (which was the homemade caramel ice cream), a small container of caramel sauce, and the sticky toffee pudding.  The waiter poured the sauce on the pudding for us. Every bite was heavenly.  Even my husband, who does not really eat dessert, really loved it! I wish there was more ice cream stick! . -Coffee: The coffee was amazing! It's a special coffee called Las Columb that Gordon orders (according to our waiter).  It came in a french press and 3 alcohol infused chocolate spoons labeled "A, B, C".  A= amarretto, C= chamboard...I can't remember B.! But they really added a nice flavor to the coffee! . . Overall, my husband would return again next time we're in Vegas. The coffee alone would make the trip worth it!
My experience at this restaurant was more "OK" than "A-OK", rendering it closer to a 2.5 than a 3. . . We came here for dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday.  I did note on the reservation that we were celebrating his birthday.  We made this reservation because we love the various Gordon Ramsay television shows, and have generally had good experiences at the West Hollywood location (Gordon Ramsay at the London).  We had fair, but high, expectations; we thought that the food and service would be excellent, but we weren't expecting to be blown away.  . . When we checked in at the hostess stand (about one minute prior to our reservation), there were a lot of young women in skimpy dresses and heavy makeup.  Not very tasteful, but it is Vegas!  The hostess who checked us in was a little snippy, and told us that we could wait in the bar/lounge until our table was ready.  It was crowded, so we declined; the hostess said she would call us when our table was ready.  We then waited for about 15 - 20 minutes in the casino until we checked with the hostess again.  She told us it would be a few more minutes, and then within about 5 minutes took us back to a table in a terrible location - immediately to the right as you enter the "chunnel."  We asked for a table that was not on a main walkway, and were told we would have to wait longer; after about 5 minutes, we were given a table in a better location. . . Other reviewers are not kidding - this restaurant is seriously loud.  It was difficult to hear our servers, and it was also difficult to have a conversation.  We were given the drinks ipad, and ordered the Drifter and Pimm's Cup.  Both were good.  We also ordered sparkling water.  After we had ordered cocktails, we were given the wine list, which was slightly irritating as we probably would have ordered wine instead of cocktails had we been given that option.  The wine list is ridiculously large, and is bound like a children's book.  It is, in my opinion, far too large for the setting and style of the restaurant.  . . After we ordered (appetizers and mains were ordered at the same time), we were given bread service.  It was ok, but nothing special.  The mushroom brioche was my favorite.  The butter with smoked sea salt was served almost frozen.  . . For appetizers, we shared:  . . American Wagyu Beef Sliders:  These were very good, and ended us being the favorite dish of the night for both of us.  The serving is 2 sliders, and I believe an additional slider can be ordered (for an additional fee).  . . Gnocci:  This was very good, as well, but not quite as good as the sliders.  The jamon was a little strange, in that the texture didn't really seem to flow with the rest of the dish.  . . For mains, we had: . . Beef Wellington:  My husband ordered this, and after watching it become infamous on Hell's Kitchen, we really expected perfection.  Sadly, it was mediocre.  The puff pastry was nice and flaky on the outside, but extremely soggy on the inside.  Not all of the fat on the meat was rendered, but the meat was good overall.  It was very heavily salted.  The sides were ok, but nothing special. . . Loup de mer:  I ordered this, and was underwhelmed.  The skin was a little overdone, but the fish itself was good.  The sauce which was served with it was not what other reviewers have described; it was red and tasted of sundried tomatoes, but with a hint of burned flavor.  It was described by the waiter as a "Romanesco" sauce, which led me to believe it was made of the green cauliflower-like vegetable of the same name, but it was not.  It was disgusting.   The grilled lemon was nice with the fish, but honestly, I expect a little more than one half of a slightly charred lemon at a restaurant like this.  . . We shared two sides: . . Burssel sprouts:  These were very good, with a nice bite from the vinegar.  . . Loaded baked potato:  This was mediocre.  The smoked gouda bechamel was underwhelming, and there was also not very much on the serving.  There was a scant amount of sour cream and chives, and three small lardons of bacon.  It was a stretch to call this a "loaded" baked potato.  . . For dessert, we shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  This was brought to us with a candle, but no one sang (which my husband appreciated immensely).  This was not a complimentary dessert, which was fine but felt a bit cheap.  . . Service was fine, but nothing special.  I expected more from a restaurant at this price point, particularly one in a location like Vegas, with a plethora of fine dining options.  . . Given that Chef Ramsay's name is plastered all over the restaurant, with his image emblazoned on the menus and signs, I would expect this restaurant to be outstanding.  As the red light fixture on the ceiling is meant to represent Ramsay's hands as he makes the Wellington, I expected that dish to be nearly flawless.  Sadly, it was not.  Our final bill, with the TR discount and pre-tip, was $224; this is quite expensive for the quality we received.
Decided to check out Ramsay's based off of a recommendation on their Rib Cap. . Arrived a bit early and checked in. Was told to wait by some slot machines while they prepared our table. While we were waiting, the 5 hostesses and one host just stood around. One hostess decided to take a drink out of a large Starbucks cup she had stored under the booth. The host decided he was going to read a text/tweet etc. . . When our table was ready the hostess asked if we had been their before and we stated no. She was barely audible and made some reference to a tube. We then entered into the main dinning area and she pointed to the ceiling where there is a neon sculpture and said something about beef wellington.. . Our waiter was very good and very knowledgeable of their menu. Started with the Market Greens. Rib Cap was very good. Charred on the outside and very tender and juicy inside. Shared the truffled mac and cheese and the asparagus. . . If your a martini drinker, they include an olive burger. It is an olive cut in half with blue cheese and a small piece of bacon. . . The ambiance is not quite there either. I like dance mix but not while eating steak. . . I would like to give this 4 stars based off of the food, however, its the whole experience that makes spending $150 for dinner enjoyable.
We had dinner here on 8/31/14...the meal was spectacular!! I wish I could give it 10 stars! We each had the rib cap steak with foie gras, it was cooked to perfection. From the wine that was recommended to the special chocolate liquor spoons served with our espresso...it was first class, decadent and service was exemplary.. Adrian was our server and Tracey was our host - both of them took great care of us!!. . Chef Ramsey you should be proud...this is what a good (good doesn't even sound "good" enough) restaurant is, your staff is excellent here!!!
Of all the places we've eaten in Vegas, I have to say this is not bad, but not my favorite. My steak was good and the dessert was great, but everything else was bland for my liking. Definitely make a reservation but expect towait a while still.
I don't mind paying for a great meal but this was more on the good side than great. I had the Lobster Wellington, i took the second half of it out of the wrapper which added nothing good to the dish, was kind of soggy. Had the truffle mac and cheese and it was the best thing I ate at this meal. The Brussel Sprouts are good but deep fried so not sure how it added much "green' that my waiter recommended. Also had the octopus and potato salad, good but could have used a lot more octopus and a lot less potato. I also had the sticky toffee pudding for desert, over rated and my friend had the coconut cake which is good if you like really sour tasting things. Overall it wasn't horrible but when you are hyped and then charge top notch prices, then you have set the expectation high and this place falls well short. Go if you must, bring some earplugs because it is annoyingly and unpleasantly loud with music literally BLARING. Solidly mediocre.
Gordon Ramsay, thank you for ruining Mac & Cheese everywhere else we go now... It was the most delicious side dish i've ever eaten, and it had PEAS andi  I HATE peas, but somehow they made it all work together perfectly. My steak was awesome, Wifes Beef Wellington was great, but oh the Mac & Cheese lol If anyone is reading this, you HAVE to try it.
Wow, this place is great.  I watch GR's food shows and I find him to be such an arrogant character and so full of himself that I had to try out this place to see if it is really all that.  Well, it was.  From food to service everything was impeccable.  There was attention to detail on everything. This was the first time I've been to a restaurant that does not put salt/pepper on the table where I didn't have to ask for them to bring it to me!   I started with the Cesar salad, then had the Kobe beef rib cap steak as an entree with the asparagus and baked potato with bechamel and pancetta sides, followed by the sticky pudding for dessert.   I thought the waiter said the sides are single serving but my friend and I shared both and didn't finish them.  Next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely go back!
We ate there last night, started with Pork Belly, had the bone in Ribeye and baked potato.  Then finished with the Sticky Toffee Pudding! It was wonderful, the service was amazing, I am happy we chose this restaurant, great food!
I love Gordon Ramsay and really wanted to try the Beef Wellington. I did, but it just wasn't my thing. I Loved, Loved, Loved the asparagus side dish with pistachio pesto. Sooooooo good. Could eat it every day! Also loved the foie gras appetizer. Overall, awesome. Would love to go back now that I can move past Beef Wellington to something else!
Gordon had melike Woah!. . While we waited for our party to arrive we had delicious drinks at the bar. The "drifter" and the "English garden," unique presentation was a nice touch. . . I was eager to try the beef Wellington after seeing him make it on TV.  That was my order and it was not a let down.  Other dishes worth a mention are: the bone in rib eye A+ sides of potatoes and asparagus also deserve an A rating. . . Must also give credit to the wait staff. They were very attentive and helpful.  Our waiter recommended getting the toffee pudding cake for dessert and it was the bomb diggity!. . The only negatives are that the menu is a bit too pricey, and the atmosphere is a bit lackluster for Vegas.
I just want to start off by saying I am a very picky eater so going to fancy steak houses and resturants always makes me nervous. The resturant itself was beautiful and modern. While waiting for our table, my boyfriend and I sat at the bar and had a drink- the drink menu was very impressive. It had a nice verieity to choose from and none made with vodka which i loved. I ordered the English Garden it was great- great flavors and a beautiful presentation. The wait staff was well educiated with everything on the menu and made great recommendations. I ordered an appetizer as my dinner because like I said I am very picky - the angus beef sliders- I do not regret it. They were amazing - small but perfect size for me. I also ordered a side of the fingerling potatoes- bite sized potatoes with sea salt and a truffle glaze-they were outrageous! Overall I had a great experience and I recommend trying it out.
Brillian! Certainly a must try! We would like to specifically thank our waiter - sadly ive forgotten his name - he is tall, African, but has a muslim name - speaks French, English and recites Bollywood songs fluently. What a great experience. I also noticed we weren't the only ones he was treating like we were at his home...he was this way to all that he served! very good man!. . The food was AMAZING and you must must must try the toffee desert with coffee...oh boy, heaven on earth!
FINALLY!!! We came here on a Saturday night back in June.  . It took forever to get reservations, but FINALLY I got one! woohoo!!!. . We arrived 10mins early, the hostess sat us up stairs.  . . We ordered the special Gordon Ramsey summer special.  Its a special limited edition 5 course dinner.  . Amuse Bouche- Scotch egg. . .delicious and creamy. . First Course- Beet root salad. . . wasn't a big fan of, I just don't like the bitter taste of beets. . Second Course- Scallop Risotto. . . AMAZING! perfectly cooked scallops! flavors blended well.  (I was picturing Gordon Ramsey yelling at the Chefs if the scallops weren't cooked properly, I watch too much hell's kitchen). . Third course- Roasted Beef Wellington. . . OH MYYY GAHHH!!! so delish!!! I never knew abt beef wellington if it wasn't for Hell's Kitchen, always wanted to try it, now I have.  Its so juicy and melts in your mouth!. . Dessert- Sticky Toffee Pudding. . . super sweet! But yummy!. . We left so full that we couldn't move.. . If you love Riesling, you must get the $90 bottle, well worth it!!! . . Our bill was about 5bills, but this place is well worth it.. . Service was amazing and our water glass was NEVER empty.
As a follow up to my original review: I must say I am very pleased with the response from the management of this restaurant. They take these reviews very seriously towards improving their product. Although our 1st experience was not what we expected I do have the desire to try them again now that I know how committed they are to providing the best possible dining experience. Job well done. We will be back.
Five days after we ate here, my husband & I still can't stop talking about how amazing this place is.. . Food: The bread is divine - especially the lemon thyme focaccia. The best steaks we've ever had. I had the American Rib Eye and he had the American Rib Cap. Our mouths now mourn that we'll never be able to have food this delicious again. We'll spend the rest of our lives looking for the same taste.. . Service: our servers Ted & Steve were great! Ted was quick to make drink recommendations (guarantees actually) and he was spot on! He also recommended the rib cap to my husband which may be the best recommendation he's ever received.. . I can't say enough about how great this place is. Everything was above par. This restaurant is what other great restaurants strive to be in both quality of food and excellence of service.. . Thank you for a great dinner!
Did not like it in general ambient is to overcharge , service us excellent but my meat was overcooked , big disappointment.
Gordon Ramsay is my star! Their meats are superb. The right temperature, taste, and feel for all their food. I love the design of the restaurant, the hot girls in their hot outfits, and the great service. I am grateful to get a chance to taste such good food from talented chefs. I believe cost range for meats are $30-90? But please. Make. Sure. I have eaten at places that cost this much but does not taste nearly as good as this place.. . I don't remember if it's a weekday or a weekend we went but we had to wait about an hr for our table. Just to give you a hint.
This review is strictly for the customer service/reservation experience. . . My husband and I have been dedicated Ramsay followers for a long time. We watch Kitchen Nightmares, Master Chef, and even the British F-Word. For us, Ramsay's Steak has been the restaurant we have saved for a "special occasion" for a long time. . . So as a surprise, my husband made a reservation for us to go to Ramsay's for Thanksgiving. He called for reservations in August. Today he called to ask if he could change the reservation to 4 people, and was told the restaurant had no record of our reservation, and was fully booked up. Sorry, nothing they can do. . . Which means, 1) if we hadn't called, we would have shown up on Thanksgiving, and not been seated. And since it is Thanksgiving, we wouldn't have been seated anywhere else either. 2) Our holiday is ruined due to the restaurant's system error. Sure, mistakes happen, but the manager's total lack of interest in doing anything to make up for the mistake was kind of shocking. I definitely expected a higher level of customer service for a place with Ramsay's name stamped on it. . . The experience has definitely put a damper on my excitement to try a restaurant I have been looking forward to for over a year. I don't know if I will ever actually go now.
Food was good. I got the pork belly and foie gras appetizers the first time I came here. Foie gras was my favorite, it was perfectly cooked and paired with a berry sauce. Second time back I got the Japanese A5 kobe, which was just ok. It really melts in your mouth, but I would've liked more flavor. Our party ordered just about every side on the menu but nothing really stood out to me.  . . The vibe here is cool, it's dark with loud music, which make me feel like I need to get ready for clubbing afterwards. It's just loud enough that you can't hear the other people at the table next to you, but fine for conversation among your own table.  The service was somewhat slow and casual.. . Now that I've tried just about everything on the menu, I'm not dying to go back, but if I have time, I might go back to try the signature wellington.
They were late seating is, an that's the only negative! Awesome dinner for five. Would highly recommend!
This has been a place I have waited a long time to attended and after my 6th trip to Vegas I was finally able to go, and let me tell you, it was AMAZING!. . My one caveat is that you will pay for it, there is no economical way to eat here, so if you are not willing to pay a premium I suggest you take a pass. If you are willing to dish out the money,  I suggest you do it right (go big or go home right?) and do the whole experience from apps to wine to thick juicy steak and dessert.. . From the get go, it is made poignantly clear that YOU are the guest of honor, as a host of servers descend upon your table to take immediate and overwhelming care of you. Furthermore, our server was about one of the best servers I have ever had, with great charm and a genuine interest in taking care of us. Our sommelier was also absolutely fantastic, offering us a great recommendations without trying to blatantly drive the price up on us. Please take advantage of their extensive knowledge and care, as they love what they do, and offer an incredible service that you seldom find in other establishments(its not like your neighborhood Chili's will be offering you inside scoop on the grape variations from the Bordeaux region and which one more perfectly pairs with your "Top Shelf Enchiladas") . . Everything I ate here was amongst the best or the best of that particular offering I have ever had. The gnocchi, for example, was hands down the best I have ever had, as it simple melted away on your pallet with a symphony of flavors and layers. The entire presentation of their various cuts of beer is truly impressive and you simply can't go wrong, Our table decided to do a mixture so that we may all try the different cuts. I must admit that my personal favorite was shockingly Ramsay's signature dish, the Beef Wellington. They warn you it takes about 45 minutes to prepare, but it is oh so worth it. Across the board, these are amongst the best cuts of beef in the world, and you will surly be on the benefiting side of things. Your taste buds will be treated to a celebration flavors so few are truly blessed to have experienced. . . On to dessert! (and trust me you will not want to skip out on dessert) This is the sweet exclamation point on what is a truly otherworldly culinary adventure. Please do yourself a favor and order the Toffee puddings, and buckle up as your mind is about to be blown! Words can no do this dessert justice, so just take my advice and go for it, you will not regret it.. . So with that, I wish all of you who are about to embark upon this journey a Bon Appetit, and hope that you enjoy your sojourn as much as I did. Remember, keep an open mind, be adventurous, and for the love of G-d don't wear shorts or sandals to a HIGH END RESTAURANT!  =)
We chose this place for our 15 year wedding anniversary. The food was great, the service was not as expected for this type of restaurant. We order a salad as an appetizer and that took 20min. We had to ask our server to confirm that we stated as an appetizer. She went to check and came back with the salad. So either she forgot to state " As  appetizer " or its because she was to busy speaking to 2 guys and the bar that she frequently visited. We still tipped her 20%. But for a $32.00 tip she should be paying closer attention to her tables and their needs. I won't drop her name But it start with a J.
Ate there on Sept. 22.. . This may be the best meal I have ever eaten. Period. The food, service and pacing was phenomenal. One downer--the music could have been toned down a bit. It's a steakhouse; the atmosphere should be a bit more refined. . . We ordered the Wagyu beef (the real Japanese stuff). We were going to split ten ounces of that (damned expensive at $32/oz., but it's something I'll probably never eat again because it is so expensive but everyone should try it once) and a 21 oz. ribeye. Our server made a mistake and brought us only six ounces. Besides saving us a hundred and thirty bucks, it turned out that both that and the ribeye were quite enough. The ribeye was probably the best I've ever had and it PALED to the Wagyu.  . . Our server (Charles) made sure the meat was sliced and placed in the center of the table so we could help ourselves. We split an appetizer (the pork belly) and each had a side (truffle fingerling potatoes and creamed corn and each side is enough for two),  dessert (the sticky toffee pudding and it's to die for).. . As I've alluded to, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Yes, you're paying for it. But, share an appetizer? Split the steaks? No sweat. Except for the noisy atmosphere, I don't think I've left a restaurant more satisfied.
So, what the heck is a vegetarian doing checking in to a steakhouse?  Well, I got married this week in Vegas.  This is where my husband wanted to have dinner.  I called ahead of time and they said they could accommodate so I told him he was in luck.. . The restaurant is beautiful.  All the girls are dressed in black.  The decor of the restaurant is very pretty.. . When we sat down I asked the waiter what I could eat.  He told me they always have a veg-friendy option and that night it was a vegetarian risotto.  We also ordered a side of brussel sprouts because I was not sure how big it would be and if I would still be hungry.  My husband ordered a filet mignon.. . Ironically this was probably the best dining experience I had in Vegas.  As Ramsey would say (sometimes) on Hell's Kitchen, 'the risotto was cooked perfectly.'  This food was so delicious and there was plenty.  Even the brussel sprouts were fantastic.  My husband said his filet was very tasty as well.  . . For dessert we ordered the dish Ramsey is well known for...the 'Sticky Toffee Pudding.'  This was one of the best desserts I have ever eaten in my life.  The cake is warm and a hot caramel sauce is poured over it.  There is also a serving of brown butter ice cream that looks like a stick of butter.  It was incredible.  My husband ordered a coffee and even that was served with chocolate infused with liquor to mix in.. . Next time I head out to Vegas I will definitely eat here again.
Way too pretentious (and I don't mind a bit of that!) From the 20 minute wait in the lounge (which seemed intentional) even with reservations, to the massive neon light on the ceiling "representing Gordon Ramsay's hand strokes while he cooks" (granted, it IS his restaurant), to the wheel 'o meat they cart around the restaurant on a mirrored trolley, to the bland Wellington we waited 45 minutes for then had to send back because it came out well done not medium rare (I am even more shocked they let it leave the kitchen this way). It also seemed one of our waiters needed to get 'permission' from someone managing the kitchen in order for us to send it back. The best part of this meal was the british ale onion soup that we started with. Hubs also liked the Caesar salad with scotch egg.. . They have an army of staff assigned to your table but somehow the service gets lost in all of this. (Head waiter, Sommelier, Jr Waiter, Water Guy). Who is who again? . . For a $400 bill (for 2 people, wine and tip) I expected to like more than the soup.
