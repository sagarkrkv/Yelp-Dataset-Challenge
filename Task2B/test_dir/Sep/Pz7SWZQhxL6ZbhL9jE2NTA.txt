Hard to offer a review on this one.  The place is really quite amazing.  It is on the topfloor of the Delano hotel, sort of a sister hotel to the Mandalay Bay. It feels like a hidden, out of the way oasis in the middle of the strip because it doesn't have a casino, the entry is from the garage for the Mandalay Bay and the place is just quiet and reserved.  The restaurant itself is striking, with views of the surrounding area and the minimalist decor making you feel like you are somewhere "special".  . . What's the problem here... yeah, I'm not talking about the food.  We didn't order everything on the menu, but I thought we ordered enough to get a good feeling of the overall foodie experience and it's just not that special.  We started with the charcuterie plate which had various cuts, but I've had much, much better.  We also ordered the gnocchi appetizers.  This was the best plate we had.  The gnocchi are light and airy and not too dense and the light sauce doesn't overpower the simple taste of the gnocchi.  Great on that one plating, but nothing else came close.   We ordered the boneless rib eye and it lacked juiciness, taste, everything.  They provided sauces with it... and the steak needed the sauces.  That shouldn't be the case with rib eye.  The sauces weren't that good either, they lacked any real flavor, just bland.  . . We ordered various sides, the fries, the asparagus, the mushrooms and, again, nothing stood out.  Very disappointing, the food just didn't live up to the atmosphere.
Although my tab was 200$ for two people... The food was really good. We ordered the lobster curry, tuna tartare, and some pasta dish. The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh. All in all, this place is the best once a month date night spot forsure.
Fantastic view - Uppity food!. . Went here for a business dinner and stopped off at the lounge first with a large group.  The lounge has a upscale vibe, contemporary decor and beautiful view.  Head straight to the outside balconies and check it out.  Most Amazing view atop the Delano Hotel behind the Mandalay Bay.. . The restaurant is all white decor with touches of red with a humongous white bobbled centerpiece chandelier that you cannot miss.  There are large tables for groups and cute mini-egg shaped booths for two.  We did the pre-fix menu which included wine pairings and were somewhat disappointed. Each entry basically consisted of tiny miniature food on large white plates.  I don't care for food that needs to be explained and that's basically what this was.  Every time a new course was served we were all trying to figure out what it was.  There were a few items that seemed as an attempt to woo you into thinking they were trying to hard such as a pina-colada flavored warm cocktail served in a martini glass.  Not the most refreshing.  And a madeline cookie for desert.  Not what you would expect from a high-class restaurant.. . The women's restroom did offer a view although not easy to appreciate through the glare of the restroom lights.  Not that its the best viewing area, go outside for that.. . Although we did not care for the food, giving it 4 stars for the Lounge view and the wonderful service by our waiter and attentive staff.  They were attentive without being instrusive and extremly friendly.. . Will return to this lounge forsure!!!!
This review is for Mix Lounge and not a restaurant experience. The lounge side is darker interiors compared to the white and clean dining area. . . We came for some place to sit and socialize after dinner and listen to some deep house while enjoying the city views.. . This is definitely one of the best views in town. Lots of the tables are set up to where you can face the view and there is also outside balcony seating as well. I much rather come here than a 30 minute ride on the High Roller. It's higher and at least what you spent went to drinks/food.  I may utilize this balcony for a cigar one of these days.. . It's a little dead on this sunday, but I don't mind that as I go out to hang out with friends instead of preen to be seen. I'm not into that whole packed like sardines club party experience really. . . Check if they have drink specials as they were running some this evening, but I was not fully sure when these happen. There were $10 cocktails and some snack specials which is not bad for "on the strip". . . For the views, house music and space to socialize I would definitely be back.
The service alone is 5 stars. The first time we were taken care of by Randy, and we were all extremely pleased with his service, knowledge of both the restaurant and the city, and his general attitude of going the extra mile. The next time we were taken care of by Scott, and once again superb service.. Our group enjoys a nice glass of wine and once again Mix did not disappoint.. . The food is delicious, specially the wagyu beef. I'd say more but my screen would start being covered in drool.. . I wish I could give more than 5 stars.
My boyfriend and I chose mix for our 10 year anniversary dinner. It was more than we could have hoped for.. The Delano hotel is stunning. It was our first time seeing it. You take a very scenic elevator ride up to the restaurant. The restaurant itself is gorgeous with a dark, sexy lounge at the entrance. We walked by a very large and CLEAN kitchen (where the magic happens). The dining room is large and modern. But we were sat in the patio. OMG the view is UNREAL! You can see the end side of Luxor and the entire lit up Vegas Strip! The most romantic table in las vegas and we were sitting at it!. The rest of the experience matched the beauty of the view. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable giving us great recommendations and really making us feel special. We had the borabora (a cocktail that takes your tastebuds on vacation!) and did the tasting menu with wine pairings. All the food and wine paired wonderfully. The vegetable salad was delicious and light. The gnocchi was so light and fluffy, perfect little potato pillows. I had the bison and my boyfriend got the filet. Both cuts of meat were cooked to perfection and tasted so good with all the components on the plate. We were brought out a pre dessert in a martini glass. A little sip of coconut heaven!!! The housemade sorbets are a must! I got the exotic sorbet and it was the perfect finish to an amazing meal! . Thank you so much to Mix for making our 10 year anniversary so very special and unforgettable!
My first visit to this restaurant--overall was very good.  The  views are excellent, I thought the service was wonderful--Matt , the sommelier, was excellent.  Started with the Lobster salad--wonderful presentation, had just the right amount of seasonings.  This was followed with the scallops--they were prepared well, how ever, the mushrooms that accompanied them seemed to me to be too earthy for this light seafood.  Had the Foie Gras accompanied with a wonderful date and raisin compote--sweet and delicate.  Tried the charcuterie plate, was surprised with the simple yet tasty samples of prosciutto and rosemary cotto ham . Main course was the Lamb--excellent preparation and presentation.  Seasoned very well.  Finished every thing off with the chocolate souffle--very light and flavorful.  Overall had a wonderful time, atmosphere was very upscale and modern, as I said earlier, the views are great. Definitely a good place to visit.
