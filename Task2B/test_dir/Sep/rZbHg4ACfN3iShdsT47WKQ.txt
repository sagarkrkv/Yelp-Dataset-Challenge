Amazing food. Great service. Sunday family special is such a huge value! Don't miss that Mac n cheese or the adult strawberry lemonade. Go here!
Very good service and very good food. The place is nicely decorated and the whole meal is affordable. The food is very tasty and very well cooked.. . As a French, my only regret was on the chicken: although the sauce was very tasty, I believe that the quality of the meat was rather poor. But I guess it is complicated to find a good "poulet fermier" (free range chicken) in the US ;-)
According to Tripadvisor Bobby Q is the Highest Rated BBQ in Arizona. Bobby Q is a very large old fashioned looking restaurant. I don't know how old it is but to me it looks a hundred years old with Giant Old Trees shading the parking lot. As you walk in you do get hit with an aromatic BBQ aroma. . . We were quickly seated and our server gave us a fast run down on Bobby Q. We learned that everything is made in house and the meats are smoked with mesquite wood. They also start everybody out with what I recognize as Johnny Cakes with soft whipped butter.. . I had the BBQ Pulled Chicken Sandwich with Pecan Cole Slaw. The Chicken was falling apart tender and laced with sweetness but not too much. A small amount of skinny fried onions were added to my sandwich on a soft grilled roll. The coleslaw was drip free and fresh and crunchy.. . My husband had a much better value item called the lunch sampler plate with 3 meats and a side. He enjoyed everything. I tried a taste of the brisket and for me it was too succulent and fatty but for my husband who likes fat he thought it was just right. My husband ate the macaroni and cheese I have to say it tasted like processed cheese. I didn't like the macaroni and cheese but I know most people do like this style. My husband liked the beans too he said they were packed with all kinds of meat ends.. . When you're all done they present you with a bag of Fresh Made Thank "Q" Cinnamon  Sugar Donuts.. . Not my stye of BBQ but I still thought it was good and plan to return for dinner.
Every visit for the past seven years have proven to be consistently amazing. Great service, flavorful food. Pretty much everything on the menu is AMAZING!
Bobby Q's entrance off 27th Avenue is subtle and in a quiet area and one of the first things you notice pulling into their lot through the small driveway flanked by bushes is that the place (and its lot) is huge.  It's obvious from its construction, that this building has been here a long time and the massively tall trees in the parking lot confirm that.  I actually parked in an "adjacent" lot next to the main one and had a decent walk to the restaurant's entrance around the corner.  The much larger bar facing the lot is NOT the entrance to go through to access the restaurant.. . Before meeting my date here, I took a look at the menu and had a mild sticker shock.  The prices are not unreasonable for a Valley restaurant; but being that we usually eat in $ or $$- restaurants, it was quite a bit more than what I'm used to.  The important question, however, wasn't whether the prices were "high", but whether food quantity and quality justified them.. . We started out with drinks.  I had the Strawberry q Lada ($9.00), which was quite delicious, with the strawberry and pina colada blending very well together.  While waiting for dinner, they also brought cornbread for each of us with butter, which was also quite good, though had it been hot instead of lukewarm,it  would have been excellent.. . My date ordered the half baby back ribs with cole slaw and baked potato.  In her case, this was very much worth the $20.00 ... and I frankly can't imagine what the "whole" for $6.00 more would have been like!  For out came what I can only describe as half of the brontosaurus ribs they used to dump on Fred Flintstone's car; an overflowing bowl of cole slaw and a potato almost as big as the half-ribs.  I ordered the "smoasted" half chicken and can only say, that presentation is everything.  It didn't seem close to half a chicken to me; but since it was served in cut up pieces and on a large plate, that might be the reason why I thought otherwise.  For sides, I had the fully stuffed baked potato (still huge) and the grilled vegetables, which, I can honestly say, should have been double the amount while the potato could've been half the size.  Since my date picked out the restaurant, it was obvious it was a favorite place for her and her husband.  As the "newbie", I was very impressed with the taste and while my plate didn't seem to be overflowing like hers, it was more than enough and worth the price.  Before tip, my tab came out to $27.08, including tax.. . Service is prompt, friendly and attentive (perhaps a bit too attentive, when you're trying to talk).  Interestingly enough, once the credit card was run, the waitress, who had constantly been checking on us throughout the meal, left us to talk in peace with only an occasional server interrupting to see if we wanted more water or Diet Coke.  Though the restaurant is nowhere near as big as the annexed bar, it is pretty roomy with dark, wood colors and a very high ceiling.  . . DIABETIC ALERT:. ------------------------. . A glance at the menu will tell you that this place is pork and beef heavy.  There are only two chicken dishes and its obvious by what comes out, that chicken is not their specialty.  A diabetic will have a very hard time eating "healthy" here.  The more serious you are about watching what you eat, the more problems you're going to have navigating the menu.  This place should more likely be considered "a-once-in-a-very-long-while" treat.  Looking around tonight, most of the patrons had waist sizes that wouldn't surprise anyone coming here.  For the most part, only the wait staff was thin/proportionate, though not always.  While the food is very good, the staff hospitable and the atmosphere welcoming, this restaurant would probably elicit a big frown on your doctor's face, if he knew you came here ... and probably give HIM a heart attack, if he heard you came here regularly.
Well guys, was extremley disappointed.You really need to employ a good pit master. Brisket was way way overdone.Pulled pork was flavorless. St Louis ribs were also way over cooked. Not impressed. You should also have someone  visit the Carolina's to taste what "real Carolina BBQ sauce tastes like. (you were nowhere close). This just goes to show that there is really no good BBQ joints in Phoenix just pretenders. The only enjoyable part of the meal was the cornbread and he sugar donuts.By the way keep hiring the kids as your waitstaff. They may be cute, but they have no idea how to wait on tables. Very disappointed.FYI way way way overpriced
The St. Louis style ribs here were on point. Very tender, very smoky, very much reminded me of the ribs I had at Pappy's Smokehouse in St. Louis, MO. The one knock on it was that it was a tad too salty, but I'm not one to complain about a little salt. They were so good we impulsively ordering a SECOND rack of ribs, only to realize that we were too full to continue soon thereafter.. . The Q-Rolls stuffed were amazing as well, especially with the chipotle dip. Imagine a buttery pastry wrapped around smoked brisket, and you get the Q-Roll. If you had to get one appetizer, get this.. . The best part is that they give you free donut holes at the end of your meal!
Excellent service! Came for lunch on a week day, the ambiance was perfect for a BBQ - not to mention the insanely good mac and cheese!
Great place if your looking for some good ol' comfort food. The ambience is fun. The cornbread is really good. Good enough for the wife to forget about her so called diet. If your debating on coming here stop it just get your butt in here! I always try different items on the menu and so far I haven't been disappointed
This place is amazing. Party of 4 ordered pretty much one of everything and it was all incredible. We eat at a lot of BBQ places around the US - one wouldn't expect one this good in Arizona. . . Portions are big. Lots of wonderful options. Highly recommend it . . The only weird part is the club. We went on a Thursday night - late. At 10pm - a club opens up next door. Not really our scene. I've never seen a BBQ place transform into a night club.
This might be my longest review ever. You don't have to read it, but you probably should. . . How this place has over 700 reviews to begin with is beyond me. Not even Amy's Baking Company has that many reviews and, as you might know, was heavily trolled after it aired on Kitchen Nightmares. They must be handing out money to folks for writing this shit. Or they're planted reviews. What's even more baffling is that it has a solid 4 stars. Methinks something is not quite right, but whatevs. Let's move on, shall we?. . This place is truly bizarre. I've been here maybe a total of 3-4 times since it first opened many years ago. It's a BBQ restaurant / club-lounge thingy. And as I learned for the first time at happy hour yesterday, it's apparently two different restaurants. At least, that's how everyone acted. My boss had made reservations for us in the Q Lounge for their Friday happy hour. Apparently you can just walk in (provided you're 21) and eat a buffet spread for free. But not until you get past the LAUNDRY LIST of dress code rules. Yes, a restaurant that serves BBQ, near Ghettrocenter, has a fucking idiotic dress code. Seriously some of the dumbest shit I have ever seen. I thought I was in metro Phoenix at a BBQ restaurant, not a Scottsdale nightclub. The list includes asinine things such as: No white t-shirts, no hats, no sunglasses, no sandals, and must be a cougar. I wanted to be like, mo' fucker, do you know this is PHOENIX? We wear sunglasses upon walking up. We wear hats to shade our faces from the blazing sun. We wear sandals, often times fashionable ones, so our feet don't get all sweaty. And white t-shirts? Now you're just acting foolish. Of course, my boyfriend whom I invited, was wearing a white t-shirt, with a nice button-up collared dress shirt (it was unbuttoned), a hat (a nice one, like derby style), and sunglasses because um, to shield your eyes? He was asked to button up his shirt, remove his sunglasses (no shit Sherlock, don't we all once we get inside?), and remove his hat. Mind you, he's a nice dresser, not some hobo with tattered clothes (usually). Had I not been invited by my boss to this happy hour, I would've bounced right then and there. It all just seemed like some giant, corny joke.. . Time for a paragraph break. It helps your eyeballs if you break things up. I'd like to point out that the actual restaurant portion does not honor said happy hour. That's right, you must go to the 21+ side with the fun dress code rules to have happy hour, even though it gets insanely crowded with nowhere to sit. Oh wait, you CAN order a happy hour beverage, but you have to get up from the table and walk your ass to the bar. If you order a beverage at your table, it'll be full price.. . I will now talk about the redeeming qualities which merited that killer 2-star review. The food is very good. The mac and cheese is the cheesiest, and all of the meat is incredibly tender. A wee bit overpriced, but not awful. They also give you free freshly-made donuts when you leave instead of a damn dinner mint. That's pretty dope. The staff is very kind. Our sever, Alicia (sp?), was very sweet and accommodating. Kudos to her.. . Lastly, it's confusing as shit to get into this place. The parking lot is weird, and if you've never been, you'll have no idea where to enter. The Q Lounge vs the restaurant portion. Two different places, remember. Even though...it's...not.. . Note: Just don't dress like you live in Phoenix. You might not get inside to the dopest dance club in all of metro Phoenix.
Miracles do happen! I'm blown away by the kindness of strangers from this restaurant! My dear friend (71 yr old) Millie lives in Phoenix (AZ) and is home bound ---her bday is tomorrow 9/21. She has been craving BQ from this restaurant all summer long! I called this restaurant (from Ashland, OR) and begged if they could please deliver food to Millie. This restaurnt only delivers for large catering job.  Not only did this place deliver her food----they gave her BQ ribs, brisket, baked potato (all the fixings), baked beans, their famous mac & cheese, cinnamon donuts, banana cream pie with a pink candle ---FOR FREE!  I also happen to mention that Millie did not even have milk in her house --- so they delivered her big cups of milk.  The delivery person's name was Jason (coincidence---just like her adoring son) and he so kindly made her a plate of food and put the rest of the food in her refrig. He even texted me a  picture so I could see my dear dear friend, Millie. I am touched by the kindness of strangers----KUDOS and heart blessings to The Managers - Joe, Rennie, Jason, the amazing chefs, and the owners of BobbyQ's Restaurant in Phoenix----THANK YOU ALL ---- !  This is truly a random act of kindness!  . . Please---If you are ever are in Phoenix - try this place ---- tell them Millie sent you!  Eat savory BQ in honor of a woman that can no longer walk. . .  http://www.bobbyq.net. . THANK U---I can't stop crying---you made her birthday so special !!!!  . . KINDNESS TRULY DOES MATTER!!!!  I am so so touched!  Bless all you who made ths amazing food====and Millie's day so special.  . . I have posted this on Facebook and yelp. I am ever so grateful.
Had the BESSSSSSST BBQ ever.....can't wait to come back again! Matt was a great server, he made sure we had plenty of drinks! The food was at our table in a flash, couldn't believe how fast it was!!!! The place was gorgus!
What a great place in not such a great area. This place is excellent. The building itself it very cool; the inside decor is unique too. Our food was fantastic. We had the spinach and artichoke dip app and shared the huge meat platter. All the meat was smoked to perfection and was just what you expect with good BBQ. Our service was great. Hostess was very friendly and didn't make us wait. Our server (Christian?) was also on point. Never missed a refill and was super efficient. This place is defiantly up to par. I will highly recommend to anyone. Even though it's a far drive from my area. Plus they give you these amazing little donuts before you leave! Just another thing that makes this place exceptional.
My only time to the restaurant was a nice experience.  I loved, absolutely loved, the Q-rolls - they are the best!  The starff was super-friendly, and our server, Trisha, was just delightful and had great personality.  The only area lacking was the salad dressing ... I tried both their Caesar and 1000 dressing, and neither of them were tasty.  So, another order of Q-rolls!
I've been in Phoenix for about 9 months now.  I had a serious craving for only 3 things since relocating here from Maryland.  That is UTZ potato chips, a real deal Holy Field Crabcake and some good soul food. . .  I've tried Honey Bears because that was deemed the best soul food in Phoenix.  What a joke!  I'll save what I thought about Honey Bears for their review.  I tried LoLo's Chicken and Waffles - I'll save that one for their review as well but I will tell you that it didn't stand a change to those Bobby Q's Beef ribs... Man my mouth watered when I typed that!. . Seriously, nothing else compares,  The sauce, the meat, the seasonings, the flavors .. good Lawd!  The roasted corn, the cute little bags of doughnuts they give you after your meal really is the icing on the cake!. . I've only been once but remember EXACTLY how good everything was I've tasted.  I think I should take a trip to Bobby Q's this Sunday
I guess you'll love this place if you're a heavy flesh eater that eats just about anything covered in sauce.  But for someone who saves their palate for quality meat, I would recommend saving your money.  The bright side, is that you'll get a choice of sauces, but other than that the food is not memorable.  I have not been back after finding red jelly (I suppose that it was congealed blood from a chicken that was too young - I'm not exactly sure) on the joints of the bones.
Insanely good! A must if you love BBQ! The beef ribs were like a tender ribeye! We got the hog heaven with babyback ribs, beef ribs, bbq chicken, and brisket! With roasted corn and Mac n cheese. Just simply awesome! Highly highly recommend! Come to find out it's the old Bobby McGees! Our table server, Jack, was very knowledgeable and accommodating as well.
You need to make a reservation for this place because it is always packed. It's always packed because it's amazing. The entire family loves it.
Well I always heard about Bobby Q's and when I got a chance for a carry out I jumped on it...I should have went with my son and his dad. They had been there the night before so I munched on their leftovers when they first went (Flintstone beef bone)...man my mouth is watering just thinking about their beef ribs and corn. Awesome and Oh so good. Well I got their chicken (and mind you I was ribbed out from munching on leftovers). My son and his dad got the ribs again and when they came with my order (the chicken) I was very very very disappointed. So bad that I was trading it for just a bite of the rib. My son liked it and thought I was crazy but it just looked like 1 breast or cut thigh. I was looking for a two pc or something. Oh well. I enjoyed the corn, the cornbread and the gravy. All in all I will stick to their beef ribs when I go.
Having read the high reviews of this place, I've been wanting to make the drive over from the East Valley for a while now to give it a go.  Not only were we more than impressed, it's definitely now on the list of must-have BBQ, even if it is a 45 minute drive away from us!. . First off, I was looking forward to the cornbread since so many people have commented on it.  It was right on par - I even caught my picky 8 year old licking his plate to get all of the crumbs, which is a first.. . I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese, my husband had the sausage and brisket with mac and cheese and fries and my son ordered the mac and cheese as his entire meal (notice a theme).  Soooo many people have commented on their mac that I made sure to mention it and we all ended up ordering it and loved it.  Even though it was absolutely fantastic, that wasn't the highlight.  My pulled pork sandwich was the best I have ever had and I finished that thing off without it ever being put down.  The meat was fall-apart tender and the sauce was a perfect blend of flavors for me (oh look, now I'm salivating again).  My husband loved his sausage and brisket and is already working on figuring out what he is going to order the next time.. . Then there's the staff, everyone was extremely friendly and made you really feel welcome.  Our server (Victoria?) was very sweet and perfectly attentive.  Overall though, the place just really made you comfortable.. . I would be remiss if i didn't mention the 'Thank Q's' doughnuts.  What a fun idea!  They are just the finishing touch on a great meal, great service and great experience!
