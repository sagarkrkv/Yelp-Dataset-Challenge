Decent food at crack prices....DONT buy a soda! $5 for a hobbit bottle, no refills-lame
Got here early for dinner. Not many people were in the restaurant. Service was good not great. Ordered the chips and salsa for appetizer.  Then shrimp mojo and 20 vegetable fried rice for main course.  Shrimp mojo was ok. Says it had garlic blackened flavor. It lacked flavor in my opinion. Would not order it again.  The fried rice on the other hand was extremely good and the presentation was awesome as well. It had loads of mini sized veggies throughout. We like spicy so we asked for a side of hot sauce. They brought out some very spicy original hot sauce which helped add some kick.
I really do like it here especially when I need a little LA fusion fix...
The idea of this place is a lot better than the execution.  Taking two typically low cost food cultures, smashing them together into a high end restaurant just disappoints.  We had some good things, we had some bad things.  All in all, I would have been happier with take-out chow mein and a random street taco.
Wow. Why all the bad reviews? I eat here every time I go to Vegas! China Poblano is pricey, but I definitely think it's worth it. The service is pretty slow, but the restaurant is usually packed and the servers are nice. I always have the chips and guacamole, the lettuce wraps are my favorite, and the papas fritas with mole sauce is pretty good too. Everything is shareable, so we usually get a few other items. I love this place.
The menu is very large.  Almost TOO big... I recommend that you do what we did and turn over some decision making to the waiter. . . We had the garlic shrimp...which should be labeled with a DONT EAT ON A FIRAT DATE logo or come with a bottle of listerine...JEEZ!  It was excellent.  . . We also had the mini burgers, liked them so much that we ordered 2 more!  . . We also had the tomato bread or some thing?  Listen, it's Vegas, there were cocktails involved, I don't remember what it was called!  Order it; ridiculous.. . We went crazy and then had the fig jam cheese for dessert.  It's $30, and totally worth it!!!
I wish I were more hungry when I came to China Poblano. My boyfriend and I on a whim decided to eat here while in Vegas and we were not disappointed. We tried a handful of things: ceviche, queso con chorizo, and tacos. If you're a cheese lover, please get the queso con chorizo. It was easily the best cheese appetizer I've ever had in my life! . . Atmosphere is really great and a fun, casual dining experience. The staff is spot on and paced perfectly. My only recommendation is that this isn't a quick in and out food experience. If you go, make sure you plan on staying to enjoy!
Came with a party of 8 waiting in their lounge area to be seated when all of a sudden I realize our orders were being taken and silverware being placed at waiting area. Ordered ceviche good but nothing at all special small for the price. Husband ordered 2 tacos and bowl of noodles which was tasty. I was left not full I asked waiter if we could have salsa &chips, which was brought out after asking for them you would expect automatic especially for a high priced restaurant. Salsa was not special. Food is Pricey for such a small amount of food. Was hungry after an hour and a half later.
My friends arrived on a later flight and hadn't eaten their dinner yet, so this was the first restaurant we found here just by walking around the second floor of the Cosmo. The place looked interesting with it's very casual atmosphere, and so, although I was kind of skeptical about a place serving Chinese and Mexican food, we decided to keep an open mind as it looked pretty decent. But boy, was it a bad mistake coming here.. . The hostess was nice enough to seat us right away even though the place looked relatively full. The server came over and welcomed us and asked us what we'd like to drink.....but I had a hard time understanding her as it sounded like she had laryngitis or something. Anyway, we decided to try a mix of dishes since the server recommended we perhaps try 2 Chinese dishes and 2 Mexican dishes just to mix it up. We  didn't want to order too much since it was pretty late so went ahead and ordered the Chips & Salsa, Beijing Glass noodles, Dancing Eggplant.....then we looked over at the next table and the dish they ordered looked interesting so we asked them how and what it was? ...it was the Gan Pung Ji Chicken and they told us it was very good! So ok, we went ahead and ordered it just to try something different.. . Oh boy. The eggplant dish had a thick black sauce over it that totally overpowered the eggplant ....kind of tasted like and overly sweet Hoisin sauce, but whatever it was, we didn't like it at all. The eggplant itself was cooked ok, but would have been tasteless without something on it, but not that strong. Next, was the Beijing Glass noodles which is more like a small noodle salad where you have to mix all the ingredients together yourself. Something tasted off about these noodles, and again, we didn't like it at all. Next was the chicken dish. It's basically a fancied up lemon chicken type dish. sauce was starchy and way too sweet.. . I think the best part of the dinner was the Chips and Salsa which tasted fresh...and together with our Coronas and red wine....somewhat made us forget about the Chinese food we had just ate. . . I can't say I will ever come back to this place as there are so many better places to eat in Vegas. And the prices of the dishes here are not cheap for what you get! Next time I think we'll stick to a real Chinese restaurant for real Chinese food.
Tasting menu is huge ... Loved the different tastes of the menu.. Great spot for a long dinner for a great value
The food was unique and full of flavor. My favorite were the Asian street tacos. The meat was very flavorful. I do not recommend this place if you are looking for good meals though, the portions are very small and a bit pricey. The place was so cool and very colorful!
