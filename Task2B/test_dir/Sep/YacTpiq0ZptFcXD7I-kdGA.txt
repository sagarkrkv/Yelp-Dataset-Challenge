Ridiculously Delicious, Best Price Ever, Great Service by Michael Jackson (LOL - yep that's his name) and just a huge surprise all around.  2 of us ordered the Buttermilk Chicken which was - seriously - finger lickin great.  We were a bit Steak'd out after 3 nights of dining and so decided on the Fried Chicken thinking how bad could it be - OMG - you've got to try it.  The bone in filet was also scrumptious - even rare.  The pecan pie desert was straight out of my home town in the South.  Four 4 people I almost fell off my chair when I got the bill it was so low.  For incredible food, exemplary service, great value and a beautiful atmosphere to eat in - ya gotta try Delmonico's... Who knew???  WOW
This place is a little gem.  Yes it is very pricey but the service combined with great food make it a great place to dine.  We had the NY Steak and Rib Eye along with the truffle chips, buttered broccoli and the chocolate cake. First the service is impeccable five star all the way.  The hosts have only a few tables and are very accessible while not being overbearing.  They have assistants that are every bit the professional as the hosts.  Was treated very well.. . The food is amazing.  The steaks are quite large and bone-in meaning great flavor.  I think better than Ruth's Chris even.  The sides were good the truffle chips are highly recommended!  and the pop-overs that they start with are good if not a bit heavy.  . . The chocolate cake was also great.  The place is pricey for sure but you get what you pay for here.  Highly recommend this place for a great experience!
Juicy ribeye and tuna salmon tartare . . The service was very good here. I really loved the ribeye, tuna salmon tartare, and their complimentary bread. The price is decent for an upscale dining restaurant. . . I tried other dishes my friends got and they weren't as good. My friends didn't really enjoy their filet mignon. I tried the pork chop and I thought the sauce was very salty. The bacon appetizer was good but tasted a bit salty as well. The creamed corn was very good but I didn't really like the bread crumbs on top of it. The creamed spinach was just ok. The potato side dish was just ok too. . . If you have an occasion you are celebrating they give you a sorbet. They also gave us a small mousse type dish for being there for the first time so that was nice. The decor is simple and had a nice ambiance. It's a nice place to try in Venetian regardless.
Previous to this review, I thought of Delmonicos as a 5 Star Place, but there have been some changes that I really dislike. Mostly the bread. They replaced those amazing Parker House rolls with some nasty Navajo Fry Bread, it's nasty, and greasy, and I don't like it.  . . Other than the bread f*** up, I like Delmonicos. The chateaubriand for 2 for $100 is a great deal! This is the real reason I come here. It comes with asparagus and garlic smashed potatoes. I add an order of sauteed mushrooms and am in heaven. . . The service and atmosphere are also top quality, but because of the rolls being gone, I am giving this place a 3 star rating until they bring them back.
Fantastic food, great service.  Much more expensive than what we usually spend on dinner, but so yummy and worth it!  We both had steak for dinner, with sides of salad in the sherry ving., garlic smashed potatoes, and the pecan pie.  I wish we had room to finish the pecan pie, but could only get through half.
Ate at the bar here and had a great experience.  Service was attentive and the food delicious.  Ordered the bone in ribeye --- enjoyed the spice rub and the meat was very tender.  Sides of broccoli and mushrooms were great.  And for a Las Vegas steakhouse, the prices were not obnoxious (a la the nearby Cut).   The banana cream pie is incredible --- great way to end your meal.
The chicken andouille gumbo is perhaps the best I have ever had and the salt and pepper crust on the filets never disappoints.  I make sure to eat here every trip to Vegas - the food and the service are impeccable.  Also love the Abita products these folks offer (both beer and root beer).
Five star service the bone in rub eye was a good size and so favor full and tender that I ate the whole thing , the strawberry shortcake was unbelievable . Unlike anything I had before, my wife loved her scallop and macadanina bread pudding. In fact. It was the olmy bread pudding I liked
The first time I was here, the steak was great.  We came back today, and the steak was a bit overcooked thought it was still real good.  The garlic mushroom side order is a must.
This is solely for the Chef's Table experience.. . The bar area, dining room, and professional wait service is on par with spendy steakhouses. The vibe is casual, yet classy and not stuffy or pretentious, but imma talk more about this other thing going on near the kitchen. . . If you want to catch a glimpse of the restaurant's inner sanctum, with a backstage-VIP-behind-the-scene view of organized chaos that is a proper kitchen service (and willing to pay for the private room setting), then prepare for a premium dinner. Anyone with an unbent iPhone 6+ can snap selfies and food pics these days, but you need just a little more than reservations for this opportunity. . . Our group was ushered through the dining room and towards the kitchen door, then guided into a side room that was separated from the dining room area. Glass panels allowed us to see the various kitchen workstations. In this fishbowl room, it was cramped quarters, like dudes crammed into a submarine mess hall, but you kinda just get used to it and settle in for the experience. Battle stations!. . The food (photos uploaded) was brought in by a team of waiters and chefs and placed in front of us in unison at every course. Each tasting was beautifully plated and delicious. Course after course was brought in, and they even paused mid-service to allow diners to return from their nicotine break before bringing in the next round of plates.. . After all these dinner courses, there isn't much room left in the tummy for dessert. I was expecting maybe something light and sweet to cleanse the palate. Suddenly, these giant platters of everything from the dessert menu appeared! It wasn't just one or two items. So much decadence and it was a surprisingly wonderful grand finale to a spectacular meal.. . For the amount $$$$pent, we could've went for bottle service, made it rain, or get swindled at a rub-n-tug joint, but we indulged on a magical evening of delightful food pr0n. Would go again if I hit a Vegas jackpot.
I would recommend this to anyone that's in Vegas and wants a good steak. The bone in ribeye was certainly amazing, along with appetizers. And I think the price is very reasonable. . . If I have to complain about anything is that I didn't like the Caesar salad cuz it was drenched in dressing. But everything else was super yummy. . . Here is what we ordered:. Tuna and salmon tartar: omg so good. Combined with the crispy chips, I could order two of it for an entry next time. . . Fresh oysters: tasted very fresh. . BBQ Shrimp: got it despite yelp reviews say not to. Thought it was pretty good. Nice bbq sauce. . . Lobster bisque: good but too salty. Tasted better with bread. There were big chunks of lobsters though. . . Caesar salad: it was made table side. Nothing spectacular, and way too much dressing. . . Bone in rib eye: Amazing. . New York Strip: pretty good but wasn't as good as the rib eye. . . Salmon: forgot the exact name but it was very good. It had like gumbo style things on the bottom which made it interesting. . . Garlic mushroom side: good . . Garlic mash potatoes: just goes so well with the rib eye.
Best steak in Vegas!!! Service was GREAT! The side mushrooms was bomb!!! It's a must go when in Vegas! Well go back there again!
