Seriously?!? I was so unimpressed with the food here. . I would rather eat at P.F Changs than come back to Tao. Yes its a beautiful restaurant, but the food is just too salty, un original, expensive. . . There are soo many places in Vegas, this is my least favorite place.
Very disappointed. Tao was recommended to us by multiple people and I thought that it had a good reputation so we decided to try it for our last night in Vegas. The service and food was not quality at all. Another review said pf changs was better and it is sad to say but true. The service was not on the level of other restaurants that we went to when here- server was not that helpful in helping to pick what to order, didn't come back to get our entree order until after apps arrived- we felt that we were bothering her by being there. The food was nothing special. Very disappointed- we hope it was just an off night for the restaurant.
We had a truly fantastic dining experience here until the very end.( I will get to that point in a minute. ) We were sat right next to the big Buddha which made for a fun dining experience. Our waitress was fantastic and everything was spot on. My girlfriend and I ordered a round of Sushi and split one of their small plate entrees of the sea bass. We liked everything so much, we ordered a second round. We truly enjoyed our experience at Tao!!!!!!!. . The only negative: We were there at about 10:30 pm and as we were finishing, we were asked if we were interested in going up to the nightclub. We said sure and they stamped our hands. When we walked up, the guy told us we still needed to go outside and stand in line . . . even though we had dined there. I thought for sure I misunderstood, so asked him again and he was extremely rude. At that point I asked the hostess and she showed us the line. Sorry Tao . . . we had better things to do than stand in your line after we just dined at your restaurant. So . . . off to the next place!!! Way to take an enjoyable experience to a ticked off experience in a matter of minutes.
I am usually NOT the one to write bad reviews but this place only deserves 3 stars because their food was actually pretty tasty. Let me start off with how crazy pack and loud this place was, I thought I was inside the club already. We had reservations & we still waited about 25 min to get seated & did not get out drink order till another 15 min or so. Finally after 30 min we got to order our food which also took another 20 min to come out. Our waitress only checked on us like once & service just sucked overall. I will never go back to this place again.
By far, this was the BEST experience I have ever had at a restaurant. From the ambiance to the food-- but most of all to the service. Our waiter Josh was outstanding. It was our friend's 30th birthday, and we wanted to make it special. But we had no idea what to order. After asking a few questions, he surprised us with course after course of FANTASTIC food. He knew what we wanted as if we had been friends with him for ages. More importantly, he believed in what he was serving. Because of his passion for what he was doing and for the food he was serving, it became contagious. WE LOVED JOSH! . . Josh if you are reading this, THANK YOU for making our experience one of the best experiences we had in our trip to Vegas.
One of Japanese sushi chef was so embarrassing.. The way he talks makes us want to leave the restaurant.. Very dissapointing management.. . Food was just ok. Another salty Asian dish you can eat anywhere. I would not come back for this service and the food.
Food and presentation were great! Service could have been better. I feel the restaurant is just too busy and the staff can't keep up. We really waited a long time for food and even for refills of water.
This place is absolutely beautiful. There's a huge lot up bar with a lounge area when you enter and the restaurant is just immense. Make a reservation if you're going with a group and ask to be seated near the huge Buddha; it makes for some great photos. I was with a large group and tried a bit of everyone's dish so I think it's safe to say that everything is delicious here. My favorite is the pad thai. A bit pricey but what isn't pricey in Vegas? This is the place to be for dinner.
If I could give no star I would but the service made my night. We make a reservation at 10:30 and she told us that it would take 5 minutes. That 5 became 10 then 15 then 5, we sat at 11:45 yeah i was so upset and disappointed we had Josh as our waiter and kinda make it up for it very nice and took time with us . But in general I would never go back very trashy too not worth my money
I had a pretty good experience at Tao, and would recommend people check it out. I'd maybe give it 3.75 stars.  Here's a random collection of thoughts:. . Service: my waitress was cheerful and pretty cool. The people at the front, however, along with the reservations girl, were aloof in the "too-cool-for-school" kind of way. Also, this place doesn't give current wait time if you call and ask them, which is unnerving (is this a problem specific to Vegas?).. . Atmosphere: 5/5. This is where Tao earns its stripes. It is a truly beautiful restaurant, with a big golden Buddha resting in the center of the restaurant, framed by lots of red booths and dark lighting. Think of it as a PF Chang's on steroids. Beautiful inside!. . Food: Nothing to write home about, about on the level of PF Chang's, but still pretty good. I tried their Orange Chicken ($28), with white Jasmine rice ($5), and it was fairly tasty (though I wasn't blown away). I also had the vegetable egg rolls ($12), and those were pretty good as well, but again not mind-blowing. . . Story 1: I came here alone (I was in the area on business), so I kinda felt like the guy in forgetting Sarah Marshall who comes to the restaurant, where Jonah Hill says "aw dude, you came alone? Do you want a magazine or something?". . Story 2: Also, I ran into multi-billionaire, and Venetian owner, Sheldon Adelson right by this place. I looked him right in the eye, he looked me in the eye. And then he looked away, and I felt poor.
I always overlooked the fact that Tao was a restaurant as well as a nightclub. Hard to imagine dining at a place where I've seen girls drunkenly run around barefoot at 2am.. . Prior to coming in, I of course had to check yelp for pictures and reviews. I was sad to find that the salmon served with udon noodles was no longer available. Also, the menu seems all sorts of confused, but I had to remind myself it's an Asian bistro... Meaning fusion; and it definitely was. They serve everything ranging from Japanese shabu to Chinese dim sum to Thai pad Thai noodles. . . A friend of mine insisted that we had to eat here because she never leaves Vegas without eating here at least once. Why? Because he's obsessed with:. . Chilean Sea Bass ($39) miso-glazed sea bass on top of a bed of veggies. Just a little sweet and all sorts of delicious. My friend did not steer me wrong. Portion was perfect and I left happy that I wasn't stuffed and excited I had room for dessert :)
I was here on Tuesday night - around 10 pm.  The food was okay, ordered a pad thai while the hubs ordered pepper steak. Drinks were strong worth the money. My only disappointment was that our server NEVER came by to ask how everything was and or of we needed anything.
It kills me to write this review. This is maybe the most disappointing dining experience I've ever had in Las Vegas. I brought a group of 11 here last Thursday night. Our waiter's name was Bobby. He strongly suggested a pre-fixe menu due to the size of our party - it would come with appetizers, main dishes and dessert for $60 a person (pre-fixe means we have no choice in what gets brought to out table, FYI).. . So after we agree to the dinner, the appetizers made it out in about 20 minutes; and honestly, they were great. Fried pork buns, spring rolls, short ribs, some kind of seafood dumplings and three rolls of sushi. Our table of 11 seemed satisfied with the amount of food we received for the first course. Also, I thought all of it was delicious. . . Unfortunately, this is where our fun ended. About an hour later, our waiter comes to our table for the FIRST time since our appetizers were dropped off and asked if we were ready for dessert. We said, "Ummm, we'd like our dinner first!". He acted shocked that we hadn't eaten yet. He left, came back a minute later and said that all of our food was delivered to another table accidentally and that he'd have a new round of food brought to us very quickly, maybe 10 minutes. Well, 20 minutes later, we started to get upset. I told Bobby that we had been waiting too long for our dinner. He tried to claim we had only been waiting 45 minutes, including the mistake. But I disagreed and he got a little upset with me. He told our table 3 minutes and our food would be out. So we waited. Again. Ten more minutes went by and I walked over to an assistant manager and asked him to please get our bill right away because we were leaving. I said we'd be happy to pay for our drinks and all the appetizers. He said that was fine. Moments later the food finally came out. But it was too late.Almost 90 minutes had passed and four people had left our party. . . Two minutes later, Bobby comes back to the table and announces that dessert is on the way - mind you, we didn't get any dinner. I told him to talk with his manager - we had already agreed to pay for what we consumed and we wanted to leave. He got more and more visibly upset with me and our group - he was also having words with the assistant manager after I demanded the bill.. . We finally got the bill and it was $327 and change. For appetizers and about 13 drinks. We tipped %15 percent, even though our service was awful; and he never gave a true apology for screwing up our dinner. . . What stinks, is that I was the reason my group went to dinner here! I convinced them to go - and we all had an awful experience. Even worse, literally no one from the restaurant seemed to care in the least. Seriously, even the assistant manager admitted it was a long time to wait for dinner, yet after being there for a total of 2 hours, they didn't even comp the drinks. . . Needless to say, I will never go there again. And 10 other people will never go again either. Its a good thing Las Vegas has so many awesome places to dine. And for that reason, you should avoid this establishment!!!
Amazing, from beginning to end! To start, the decor makes you feel like you're truly in Asia! The service was impeccable. A lot of team work, very friendly and knowledgeable.  I had the Tao martini, delicious, the couple sitting next me saw mine and ordered one as well.  I started out with the lobster wontons, oh so yummie! In a nice hot pot, so they stay nice and hot, I'd say its a good appetizer to share.  Then I had their vegetable fried rice, very good and the molten chocolate cake, awesome!!! Can't wait to go back! I def enjoy this one more than the one in NYC.
We went as a company on business. The service was outstanding and the food was better. If you want a meal, cocktails and a great place to visit, this will blow you away. There was not a food they served that did not please the palate.
This is another restaurant that I ate at while on my honeymoon.  We stayed at the Venetian and thought it looked like a fabulous place.  . . The restaurant itself is beautiful.  There are tubs filled with flowers as you walk in.  The decor is really pretty and there is a huge Buddah statue in the restaurant.. . They have a nice sized menu.  I would have given them 5 stars but there were a couple of things I found weird.  I am a vegetarian and told this to the waiter.  He helped me out by telling me what was safe to eat.  There was a side of broccoli and he told me it was made with chicken stock.  The food tasted freshly prepared (which for the price I would hope it is) so I don't really understand why the dish could not be made vegetarian as other restaurants do for me.  I ended up ordering vegetable fried rice and asked if they could add pineapple because I saw they used it in another dish.  The waiter told me he could ask but was not sure the chef would do it.  They did not as he tried to make a nice gesture and brought me some raw pineapple on the side when my rice came out.  Again, I think it is weird that the chef would be so rigid.. . Other than that I have to say the food was delicious.  My rice was very good.  The vegetable dumplings were so good we got a second order. The vegetable sides I was able to order were tasty.  My husband had a pepper steak dish and said other than some peppers being overwhelming was good as well.  . . During the reservation we were asked if we were celebrating anything so we let them know we came to Vegas to get married.  They did bring us a surprise dessert which was a great gesture.  It was a huge fortune cookie that when cracked open contained what tasted like both a chocolate and a vanilla mousse.  Whatever it was, it was adorable and tasted very nice.  I did enjoy the experience and the food and would love to eat here again next time I visit Vegas.
