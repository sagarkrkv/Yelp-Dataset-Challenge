My girlfriend's BBQ chicken nachos were not any good and the hot wings had a weird taste to them that made me feel sick. Won't be eating here ever again.
We only had about an hour to eat before we had to go to a show we had tickets for, so we decided to stop in BLT Burger.  It didn't look very crowded which was a plus.  Service was very friendly, food came out fast, ambiance was great.. but one thing wrong. The food was just not good! I had the Tex Mex burger, which came with chili, cheese, jalapeno, sour cream, and avocado.  WOW, that must be packed with flavor right? Wrong! Another thing I didn't think... I ordered my burger medium, but it was rare as all get out.  Now reading the reviews.. I see that's common. I should have gotten well done if I wanted medium. Bleh. The place is overpriced, we paid $60 for 2 burgers, 1 order of fries and 2 drinks. :-/ Will not be back.
I had BLT burger last night and it was absolutely delightful ! I split the tex-mex burger with my friend. We also got the loaded waffle fries topped with sour cream,cheese and jalapenos. I had an apple cider beer and the half-sours (half pickle half cucumber) they have will rock your world. Try one. I will absolutely be going back. Nice guys that work there also.
We are constantly on the search for the best burger in town. During our last vegas visit, we checked out BLT Burger given the rave reviews it had gotten. It was okay... I mean prices are ALWAYS high in Vegas, folks, so let's not even discuss that. Let's talk about the important thing - food!. . The shake was really good, we had the oreo cookie shake and it was plenty to share. The fried dill pickles also hit the spot and the breading was really tasty. Our burgers came out and unfortunately the bacon was wayyyy to well done and that turned us off a bit. Other than that, they were tasty. I didn't like that there was no lettuce, tomato, onion served alongside the burger. That should always be available in my opinion in case you want to add some of that fresh crisp to your fried goodness. . . The service was slow, but waiter was very friendly and seemed to enjoy his job, which is always a nice change from the disgruntled, hungover waitstaff you can run into at some Vegas places :). . I might return to try it out again, but would most likely opt for Burger Bar instead.
fired pickles are never a disappointment.. However the sliders werent good at all.
I love this restaurant!  This time, we had the 80 burger and the classic burger (plus cheddar and avocado).  They came slightly more well done than we ordered (the burger ordered med-rare arrived medium, and the burger ordered med-well arrived well), but were still juicy.  We ordered the fat fries and the curly fries, both of which were great.  Our server, Missy, was fantastic - the perfect mix of chatty but not overwhelming, and was totally on top of service.
This was a great place for burgers my turkey burger was awesome and the server was great.
The OREO milkshake was OUTSTANDING...probably one of the best I've ever had.. . The burgers were huge and pretty good but a tad bit overdone. The onion rings were also overdone but at least there were TONS, enough to share with a few left over.. . The wings are worth a mention though. Very hot & crispy with a great dipping sauce, their version of ranch. Wish they served them with carrots and not just celery but don't want to pick cause they were REALLY good wings.. . Our server was nice, when she was around but thankfully we were on vacation and in no hurry.. . Would I return? Probably not. Just nothing there to really go crazy about, especially not for the $55 we paid for lunch. That part still kills me but it is Vegas so...
Loved the food here! We were looking for something quick and casual and found this place at the Mirage. There was a small line but it was constantly moving - took us 5 minutes to get seated.. . Service was excellent! We loved our server for his friendly suggestions and amazing attitude... just made the meal taste even better.. . Highly recommend the American Wagyu burger... medium done. It was perfectly tender and juicy, way better than some burgers I've had at more famous, chef-backed joints. The flavor of the portabello mushroom mixed with the truffle aioli...  just mmmMmm! . . Also liked Grandma's Treat (shake). Sweet but not sickeningly sweet, and just the right amount of Makers Mark blended with the caramel so the alcohol flavor came through but it was still easy to gulp down. I actually preferred this one over any of the ones at Holsteins but I'm sure those that love their hard liquor will disagree with me.
Ate at BLT with a group of friends during a small convention. Overall great place with strong service. Only drawback is that they offer almost nothing for those that are trying to watch what they eat. I mean, yeah, it's a burger place and the name tells you what you're getting into. I can accept that. . . Ordered the veggie salad with grilled shrimp. The salad is about the only thing you can order if you're trying to be careful. With that said, it was very, very good. Lots of vegetables, great dressing and the shrimp add-on was outstanding.  . . Prices are a tad on the high side, but it's situated on the strip inside a mondo property. It is what it is.
First thing we ate in Vegas after checking in to the Venetian across the street. . . Ambiance - 4 Stars: We liked the decor. Cool Edison style light bulbs, Wood ceiling, and the kitchen area behind the bar was pretty cool as well. . . Service - 4 Stars: It's a burger place, so nothing over the top to be expected. Service was on par, waitress wasn't overly pesky nor was she invisible. . . Food - 4 Stars: I ordered the BLT burger w/ American cheese and the Fat Fries with a Nightrider milkshake. The milkshake came out first, and I almost wish this is all I had! It was super delicious. The burger was quite good as well, not the best I've ever had but definitely top 5. I wasn't a huge fan of the Fat fries, but got them by recommendation from the waitress. Fiance had the I-80 burger, curly fries, and Tucan shake. These were all super delicious, and she really enjoyed it. . . A bit expensive, but as we later found out - all the food is inflated quite a bit. I was sort of shocked when the cost of a burger and fries was around 20 bucks, not including the milkshake. Our bill was around $80 for two, which is a large amount for 2 burgers. . . If you're looking for something better than the Food Court for lunch, I would certainly recommend BLT Burger.
Quick lunch after walking the strip in the blazing heat!.  No wait even thought it was lunch time on a Saturday. . Our burger good, got crisscut fries and the wedges. Burger was a little small and small side portions. . . The 4 stars is for the excellent service. Our waitress was so friendly and our water glasses were always promptly refilled-much appreciated for the Labor Day weekend Las Vegas heat :)
The burger was great.  It was a good size, but not too big that you can't finish it.  I got the 80 - BBQ, bacon.  It was delicious and cooked perfectly. I also got the waffle fries, which were good as well.  It was $15 just for the burger and another $5 for the fries.  This price was pretty steep considering it was just a regular sized meal.  I'm good with the size of the meal, but would prefer a lower cost.  I balanced the thought of the high cost with the fact that it must be good quality ingredients.  I was staying in the Mirage and was going to the Beatles Love show so I placed my order to go, ran up stairs to change clothes and then grabbed my food to go.
High quality ingredients...very flavorful burger made with 3 meats.  Best meal at the Mirage.
Located on the ground floor in the Mirage. Probably the Best Burger I have ever ate !!!. The meat was juicy and flavorful, just the right mix for a perfect burger. I had a well done burger w/ bacon, cheese, lettuce and tomato. We had waffle fries, regular fries and sweet potato fries, all were good but not great. I prefer the fresh cut boardwalk style french fries.The ambience is of a nicer, classier restaurant. The food came out quickly and our waiter was attentive to our group quickly fulfilling any of our requests for refills and condiments. I highly recommend going to BLT Burger to satisfy your burger urge !
Probably the best burger and shakes I've had in my life, and belief me, I'm a burger connoisseur.  The week special burger was unforgettable - Angus, Portobello, Spinach, and Gouda. Paired this with a great shake which included a shot of espesso, kahlua, baileys, and coffee ice cream. The only negative was that the food was a bit cold for restaurant temp, but who cares, the food was amazing.
Over priced food! Service was great! Milk shake was amazing! Curly fries were luke warm like they had been sitting around for awhile. The burger was exactly as described, but not special at all. The I-80 was rather bland.
Basic burger and onion rings were good not great. Decent meal if you're at the Mirage but otherwise I'd look for another option if I was inclined to go elsewhere.
