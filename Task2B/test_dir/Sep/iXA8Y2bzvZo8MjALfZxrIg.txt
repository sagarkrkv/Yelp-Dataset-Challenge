The food and drinks here are to die for! My drink was a bit strong but still amazingly good and the burgers were to good to just eat one (if I had any room left in my stomach that is!)
After all these years finally made it here. Went about 10pm Wed for my daughters 21st bday no wait we were seated immediately. Had a great waitress Cindy. We all ordered something different as usual so we could taste different things. A fish sandwich w/fries, a salad she wasnt feelin well only came with lettuce tomato and cucumber, 1pork taco &1 beef taco  beans that we had to pay extra for, what tacos no beans and rice included ludacris, and a steak that came with fries what no choice of fries mashed or baked and no veggies, 1 soda 2 margaritas $105.00. This had to be the most disappointing meal i have ever had, mainly because we had wanted to dine here for so long. I could have bought a better looking salad from the grocery store, my daughter only ate 2 bites of her fish sandwich it was made with grouper and disgusting, my other daughter said her tacos were ok beans too salty, now for my steak cooked exactly as ordered but soooo much salt it was ridiculous. The margaritas watermelon & strawberry were void of fruit flavor and alcohol. I guess we should have ordered what they are famous for the giant order of nachos which were coming out of the kitchen constantly. Give them 1 star because of the service.
Live music, great drinks and the nachos were to die for. Enjoy with a group not alone.
Love Margaritaville!! Great people watching on the deck outside the bar, great show inside with the hottie sliding into the margarita glass & a fun atmosphere. Its on the expensive side but its Vegas what do you expect?
Sad to see less than 4 stars! Yes it's touristy but it's absolutely an experience. You must get a margarita blender and sweet potato fries!! Nachos are good too! Everyone was sharing their margarita's! We had a great time even waiting for our seat, in the guest shop, at the bar, and talking to guests and staff!
I usually don't like these giant touristy places but Margaritaville is awesome. I wondered in here my very first time in Vegas and thought the atmosphere and decor was a bit cheesy but after my second margarita and first 10 minutes into their volcano nachos I was in love. Their pricing is great considering it's in Vegas right on strip across from Caesars. The portions are HUGE... so it's the perfect place to just sit and fight off a hangover and fill your stomach. The service has been perfect every time I've been. The last time I was there the place was packed I had a waiter who was on point the entire time, knew everything about each beer and entree we asked about, had our waters full the whole time, and even drew a detailed doodle of himself on the receipt. . . MARGARITAVILLE IS THE $H!T !!!
Huge place. Hostess wasn't overly friendly. We got right in and got a table. Server was great we started with volcano nachos which are enormous! That is a meal within itself and very good. House margarita was good. We did catch the show they do with the chick going down the slide into a blender. Pretty cool.
