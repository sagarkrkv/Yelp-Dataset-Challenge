Absolutely love this hotel.  I'm a local and my boyfriend and I stay once a month there!  . We get treated like royalty!  Never had a problem with anything.  And when we had, it got solved right away with extra perks on the side.. We usually stay there or Cosmo but we like this casino better since the crowd in there is more mature than the loud younger crowd of Cosmo... and we are under 30 so it's not like we can't handle that atmosphere. . I always recommend this casino to all my friends when they come visit ;)
Aria is a great place to stay in Vegas! It is close by anywhere you need to go. . . My group got the corner suite, and dayumm the view! The suite was smaller than expected but there are little things that made up for it. . . First, I am deeply impressed with the main bathroom. It is every girl's dream! The lighting was perfect for girls to get ready and perfect their look for a big night and also spacious to fit many girls at once. The half bath is also great too!. . The bedroom was blocked from the living room with a sliding door and had an amazing view of the city. You could control lights, curtains, tv, music, and room privacy with just a push of a button (same goes for the living room)! I have never slept on such a comfortable bed. After a night of partying, 3 friends and I were chilling on the bed and we all knocked out within minutes because it was ridiculously too comfortable. There is a closet with an iron/board as well!. . The living room was small in my opinion but still cozy. The TV was nice to relax to and also gives you options to bump up the music for your pregame! There is a small bar and fridge, but no coffee maker? Or it was hidden somewhere. That loss made my mornings rough. . . The location was golden though. To get to Marquee, you just walk across the bridge. To go shopping in Planet Hollywood or eat at Earls, just another bridge again! Partying to eating to sleeping was within a 10-15 min walking distance from each other.. . I definitely recommend the corner suite to couples or groups. I went with a group of 12 and we fit comfortably, and the 1.5 bath really helps out with crowded bathrooms!
Just got back from  my ninth stay at Aria.. I have stayed at every other 4 and 5 star hotel in Las Vegas and keep coming back here.. Rooms and corner suites are great.. Most comfortable beds in Las Vegas !!. Easy walk to Monte Carlo(connected indoor walkway),Bellagio,,Cosmo and PH.. Dealers and Pit Bosses have been very friendly... You don't have to dodge as many strolling tourists as there are at Bellagio,Caesars, and others.. Great restaurant selection.
According to the front desk staff, the Aria had a *planned* system downtime for over 40 minutes at 4pm this afternoon. It took us over an hour to get checked in- that's an hour of my vacation wasted due to someone's poor planning.   . . The front desk staff kept saying it will just be 10 minutes- even when it was clearly well over 30 minutes.  If you must have downtime at prime check-in time, at least you could correctly communicate the situation.  . . Next time, you might want to try scheduling your computer system outages overnight.
I have been at the Aria a total of an hour and still haven't managed to be able to check in due to the incompetence of the operations here. First, the self parking is about a mile from the front desk through the entire casino. While typical of a Vegas casino, it's still incredibly annoying. Then, hopped in the line with about 20-25 people in front of us. About half way through the line they stopped checking anyone in. Eventually some agent came through the line saying they were "updating" the computers and it would only take 10 minutes. 10 minutes later another employee came through offering water saying that the systems would be up any minute now. Another roughly 10 minutes have passed. And, what looks to be a manager, Reginald, strolls through the line not addressing anything unless asked. So, I asked how things were going about 27 minutes into the wait. He told me that in fact, this shut down was scheduled. Yes, the Aria thought it was good to shut down their systems at 4PM to update it. Well, it's now 4:37 PM and no sign of the systems being up anytime soon, yet everyone is so assuring saying " it should be up anytime." Reginald also told me the shut would take 5-15 minutes. Yet another lie considering at that point it had already been over 20 minutes. Poor, poor communication, execution, and operations on the part of the Aria. Haven't even seen my room yet and I will absolutely never stay here again.
The best hotel is Las Vegas! Excellent service, excellent food, I love their Buffet - truly the best. The room was great, we checked out from this hotel today. Next time I am in Vegas, will go there. This is the place where they really treat you like a queen. . . Pools are amazing, everything is so clean and of high quality. . . And all restaurants that are located in Aria are excellent, especially Julian Serrano.. . Thanks so much for providing high quality 5 star service.
The best hotel ever. . . Clean , modern, up to date, beautiful, and worth every penny.. . This hotel is in the perfect place on the strip AMD is amazing. Jaw dropping from the gate.
We stayed here for a nice long weekend over Labor Day. We were able to check in upon our extremely early arrival from the airport. That was great and I'm glad they accommodated. Our room was beautiful. Very adult. Dark shades. Dark walls. Dark furniture. Not bright and crazy like other Vegas hotels we've stayed at. I'd actually decorate my house like this. We had a view of the pool, which we scoped out every morning to get the best seats. . . They even brought a refrigerator to our room so we could store our own water. It was very prompt. After a incidence with the pool at XS my phone needed some uncooked rice to soak in. They accommodated the strange request. Housekeeping gave my husband several shampoos that he enjoyed. Their vanity kit came w a much needed makeup removal wipe. Maybe more for their sake that my mascara doesn't smudge all over their linens and towel. . . The hotel was beautiful. Beautiful architecture. We had a nice workout in their fully equipped gym. $50 for a yoga or workout class was too pricey. They had great treadmills with screens and tv and synced your workout. But too bad they didn't have a USB for the iPhone 5. Not a biggie. I'm not one for looking at my workout anyway. . . Loved the pool. Great sun. Cold water jugs perched everywhere. We had to chase down waitresses sometimes. But their delicious refreshing alcoholic drinks and food hit the spot. The furthest pool seemed a bit dirty. Mostly drinking adults. Smaller and just seemed trashier. . . Loved it. Will definitely stay for another visit.
Super clean and beautiful hotel. We got a standard king room & loved it. 25th floor overlooking the strip. Loved the remote control of the whole room from the bed! Speaking of bed.....omg. The.Most.Comfortable bed EVER! Easy access to our rooms never had to wait on an elevator. They have 3 pools and club liquid pool. Awesome pools. Yes the drinks are $15-30 but they were delicious as well. Lol. You can bring your own drinks to the pool in a cup...but they will check your bags you bring. We ate at the buffet....it's was ok needs bigger selection. Ruby our server was the best ever though. We also ate at Julian Serrano had happy hour tapas and drinks 5-5:30. Have to try the dates and the calamari! Tried out cafe aria for breakfast and it was good typically entree is $15-18. This place is worth the $$$$
On arrival at 3pm (check-in opens at 3pm) was told that our room was not ready and was still being cleaned and they where unsure of how long it will take. To compansate use they gave as $50 resort credit. However one member of our group was not happy with this and complained and we was given a room within 5 minutes plus the resort credit!!. . The room itself was very nice (two twin double city view) clean and tidy. The view was okay not what I expected but I think I'm comparing it to The Cosmopolitan which I stayed in 2 years ago and that had amazing views so I maybe biased.. . The hotel has amazing restaurants and facilities, staff are very friendly and more than willing to help.
We stayed here in July.  We were only here for one night.  The room appeared nice and I liked the remote curtains.  However, the next morning when we got up to get ready, I went to run a bath.  There was a bobby pin in the bathtub.  This might not seem like a big thing but it made it obvious that no one had cleaned the bathtub prior to our staying there.  So after deciding on a shower...I removed one of the towels from the folded ones under the vanity and there was a wad of used tissues behind the stack of towels.  Gross.  When we came home I replied to the auto review that the Aria sends and listed the complaints.  After a few days the reply Igot was basically..."Sorry, we will forward your comments on.  This isn't usually the case.  We hope you try us again!"  That's it.  I would expect more from a place that touts itself a luxury hotel.  There are too many other options in Vegas to bother going back to a dirty hotel.
The rooms are nice, spacious and we had a nice view of the strip.   but can somebody tell me WTF is a resort fee, and why are all these hotels charging it?.. thats ridiculous , its to use the "amenities" none of which we used as we were just there over night.  I think they need to let people choose weather or not they want to use the amenities..  aside from the long lines to check in, the staff was friendly and the rooms were nice and clean.
For a standard room, it was very spacious.  My favorite part was the shower and tub in my room.  I have stayed at a couple hotels in Las Vegas and the Aria is by far my favorite.
The Aria hotel and casino is beautiful, clean and does NOT smell like smoke!!!  The casino, lobby and restaurant decor is fresh and inspiring.  The rooms are large with open skyline views of the strip or surrounding mountains.  The hotel staff were super friendly and helpful.  The business center staff and conference center was outstanding!  It is in a great location on the strip in the center of everything.  We walked up and down the strip visiting different hotels and casinos easily.  The Venetion is at the other end so takes a while to walk to see, but truthfully most everything was on the the Aria end!  The pool area was very nice and restful as well.  Hotel rooms were very reasonable at around $180 for a high floor (mid-30's.)  Very quiet in rooms and fun in the common areas.  This is the nicest and cleanest place I have stayed on the strip. The check in line was a bit long at times.  If you want your room in the morning pay for the guaranteed early check in or you may not have a room available.  This resort is outstanding! We will definitely be back!
Aria's customer service goes above and beyond typical customer service! I called them with a ridiculous request and Steven was so happy to accommodate me and try to trouble shoot my problem! I think 99% of people would have laughed at me and hung up the phone but Steven was patient and funny and so happy to give me exceptional service! My girls and I are going there tonight just to meet the guy!. . In this age of resignation and technological disconnect it is so unexpected and delightful to come across someone who actually cares!. . Thank you Steven!
My stay at the Aria was for Business and Pleasure, but it felt like pleasure most if the time. Here is the good:. . The rooms are fun! Modern with automated controls that do everything from open and close the blinds to controlling the lights. . . The Pools: instead of having one large pool they split it into multiple smaller pools which opens the space up for more chairs and cabanas. The wait staff is great andthere to get you almost anything you need or want. . . Staff: From checkin to checkout, the staff is there to make your stay wonderful. I told the front desk attendant that my Fiancee was visiting Vegas for the first time so he shifted our room so we had a view of the strip. Our blinds broke at one point and within 3 minutes a tech knocked on our door and had it fixed in 5 minutes. The maid noticed we used certain bath products more than the other and without asking, stocked extra.. . Here's what could be improved:. . The conference food was sub standard. We had a white fish that no one could eat or identify.  The AV equipment caused some problems throughout the day and some rooms were 90 degrees while others were 60.. . Besides Jean Phillipe, the other dining options are not so great. Other hotels have buffets that are significantly better than Aria's the Buffet and the Aria cafe is ok at best. Instead go to Wicked Spoon or Gordon Ramsey Burger. . . Finally the price of onsite items are insane. For example a bottle of sunscreen is 38 dollars so plan ahead
Can I just move in here? Love this place. Check out the lobby bar... Manny is amazing. Best drinks.
Got a city view and it was gorgeous (worth the extra upgrade)! Some tables were a little dusty, but overall it was clean. Our first room had someone's medication in the fridge and I called to make sure the room was cleaned and they said the bar wasn't checked, so they switched us to another room. Easy to do since they just change it on the room key so you don't need to go down to the lobby! Pretty high tech with the remote to control curtains too. In a great location, has the Crystal Shops right next door which takes you to Cosmo also. . . Shower was open and spacious. Love bigger showers, hate when you pay for a nice room and the shower is tiny. There's a nice big tub too but they don't have any bubbles so bring you're own if you want a little bubble bath (= Beds are comfortable. The only thing I didn't like about the regular room was no fridge space. They have a fridge filled with all of their good for purchase, and if you move it they automatically charge you. Where do I put my leftover food!? . . Also stayed in a 1 bedroom corner suite and the main bathroom was amazing. The tub faced the view. So spacious and homey. The suite had an extra fridge to put your own stuff in so I didn't have to worry about where to put extra food or drinks. Wish they could just do this is every room. . . Pools are nice (4 stars): Gets pretty crowded, and the pool bar can get packed at times also. When I came here a couple years ago I had the best passion fruit mojito, but the bartender said they couldn't make it this time, wth! Got the margarita instead, which was good still, but not as good as that passion fruit mojito. Really expensive drinks!. . Service (5 stars). Great, no problems.. . Room Service (2 stars). Oh my the food was gross. I ordered a breakfast burrito and tried the margarita pizza. The pizza was okay, the burrito I could barely eat. It just smelled bad and had no flavor! So don't order room service..wish I went across to Cosmo for late night secret pizza instead.
We stayed at the Aria labor day weekend and we weren't disappointed. The location is perfect! It's right in the middle of the strip and is connected to other hotels by tram. We were seeing a concert at the Cosmo, so it was very convenient. IT was also close to the MGM grand and other hotels with night clubs worth visiting.  The casino was nice, but not too crowded and I really enjoyed the pool. It was easy to sit and relax without having to fight people for a lounge chair. The rooms were clean and moderately priced, but I have to take away one star since they did not service our room when we put the light on. After I called and complained, they did the room within half an hour, but I think if they have a light to tell them to "service" the room, they should do it at that time. We were out from 6pm until 3am and our room wasn't serviced. My advice, call housekeeping when you leave the room so that the "rush service" you room. Other than that, our stay was pleasant and the staff was super friendly. Would definitely stay here again!
Stayed here for 3 nights for the first time (we have stayed just about everywhere in Vegas over the last 30 years).  Excellent location, directly next to Cosmo which is a great hotel (check out the Bond Bar) and the Crystals shopping center with every major purse and jewelry store.  There is also a really good pub there which is less expensive than the hotel's eateries.. Room was modern and nicely appointed although the bathroom fixtures were kind of cheap and they have this strange connected shower/bathtub combo that was a fail.  The room had smart controls for everything, by the third night I had it figured out and then I checked out.. Staff was the best thing. When you called the front desk, the concierge and even the valet parking you got a HUMAN on the first ring!  When is the last time that happened in a hotel.  Every employee was wonderful.  I can't say that about many places I have stayed.. The casino was pretty good.. The restaurants are all way overpriced.. The main thing I felt here was that the hotel was kind of generic nice.  Beautiful but no soul.  Definitely go back with the right deal.. . Mig, not turning cartwheels but pleased
My Boyfriend and I had a great time at Aria.  It was my boyfriend's first time in Vegas and I had been once, stayed at MGM before.  Aria was a lot more modernized than MGM. The room was beautiful, two person stand up shower, and the view was amazing. There is a lot to see in Vegas but every day we were excited to come back and hang out in the room because it was just that nice. Great experience, will recommend to others!
I've stayed at Aria back in 2010/2011 and our recent stay was a great refresh on why I love it so much...  . . This go round, we stayed at Aria for three nights and I must say that it is as excellent as I remembered.  Where do I begin?. . The rooms are...  Oh my gosh - if you do not get a good night of rest in this bed - you are truly missing out on something OR perhaps you're out all night partying/gambling.  The beds are the best part of my stay. They are cozy and the rooms are well ventilated and spacious.  The automated curtains and lighting are also super fun and the block out shades help with sleeping.   I also love the bathroom layout.. the shower and tub.. genius! I always bring extra cleaner - scrub the tub down - and then relax for a nice bubble bath. . . Second thing you must do while staying at Aria -- order room service! You may think that Vegas is all about the nightlife... but trust me, order the Belgian waffle and a side order of the chicken tenders for a lovely take on the chicken + waffle craze. Enjoy it while in your pajamas and it beats anything happening on The Strip. ;). . The customer service is always top-notch - the staff is always friendly, knowledgeable and courteous.  I look forward to our next visit. . . ps. . The sports book is now smoke free! Which was a welcome treat for me as I do not smoke and hate hanging out watching the games with my husband while suffocating in smoke fumes.
Great room and even better in room dining staff. Check in line was a little long but everything else was easy thanks to the technology available (TV check out from room). Valet was easy and quick service each morning. I would stay again or recommend to others.
Clean, great location, friendly service, spacious rooms. Great place to relax at but still be in the center of the party scene. . . Decor is more formal/modern with high tech devices in the rooms and the amenities are good quality. Definitely a place I'll reconsider when visiting Vegas!
This is my fourth time staying at the hotel and I must say that the quality of service, venue up keep, and overall hotel experience is NOT what it used to be. We pay way too much money to stay here for it NOT to be up to par!!!
Just came back from a stay at the Aria and I absolutely fell in love with the hotel. The hotel is beautiful and service is great from the staff all around.. . The room - Spacious with the most comfortable bed I've slept in. My girlfriend and I don't normally sleep for 8 hours at a time but we did at the Aria. . . The casino - Dealers were very friendly and were not robot-like as you can find in other casinos. Very comfortable atmosphere.. . The spa - $30 will get you an all day pass to an excellent spa featuring hot tubs, ice pool, eucalyptus steam room, sauna, salt room, hot stone bed, infinity pool, as well as drinks and snacks. An easy way to spend a few hours to unwind.. . The pool - The hotel has 3 elliptical shaped pools. The water temperature was just right and I loved the entry to the pools. The only problem was that the pools were too shallow - only 3 feet deep.. . The only issue I had was with housekeeping. For some odd reason, they failed to make up my room 2 days in a row. That was very odd.. . But overall, I loved the hotel and will definitely go back for another stay.
I will go four stars although many aspects are five star worthy.  The hotel is gorgeous clean offers lots of security and amenities.   We stayed during fight week and even at its busiest it did not seem nearly as crowded as Caesars, Bellagio or Venetian.   Those hotel attract lots of tourists in addition with there guests.. . Food was excellent in all the locations we ate.   Service was impeccable and friendly.. . Here is the big warning for all (listen up because you will thank me), you must get room that is opposite of the Cosmopolitan.   There is a day club and night club outdoors at the Cosmo.  It is loud and is open until 4am.   You can here the loud thumping of the music all day and night.   I am literally listening to it as I type this.mm you have been warned!. . All in all I woud recommend and plan to visit Aria again in the future.
1st I should tell you that this was my 1st trip to Vegas.  I stayed in one location for a night before my reservation at Aria.  However, I walked through many of the other hotels during this trip (at least 10).  I really liked the beauty of Venetian, Bellagio, and Caesar's, but Aria is PERFECT for me!  This is why.... . Atmosphere:  I loved the contemporary feel and decor.  Nice colors throughout.  I like the high ceilings.  I am glad the casino was small as I didn't have to smell like smoke when I walked to the elevator to my room.  VERY CLEAN.  I REALLY enjoyed the music being piped through the hotel, which is dance & techno.  My husband and I could of easily been caught dancing in the elevator.. . Staff:  Very friendly.  Great service in all areas.  I even had a service in the spa.  There was inconsistencies in the room service.  Each time my room was serviced I ended up with different items in bathroom.  . . Room:  I loved my room.  Again contemporary.  Nice decor.  Easy to sleep with subdued colors.  Bed I was comfortable and felt like it kept my body temp.  Can I take it in my luggage?  It's all automated.  GET THE LESSON FROM THE BELLHOP.  We  didn't and regretted it.  I was located in a room looking out to Cosmopolitan; this was NOT IDEAL as they have a day & night club.  Loud and distracting.  I was able to block it out and fall asleep, but my husband was not.  We will be asking for a room far from that next time.  EXCELLENT in-room dining for breakfast, although costly.  . . Pool:  Simple pool areas.  Bathroom facility was very clean.  HIGHLIGHT- Aria provides spring water stations with cups for pool guests.  Very thankful as I drink a lot of water and didn't have to go far for it.  Have friendly waitresses, but could use more.  Good system to get food delivered.  Think Aria should consider a system to gain waitress service for drinks.  I've seen some resorts use a little flag.  . . I WILL BE BACK.
As a first-time visitor, I was extremely impressed with how beautiful and fancy this hotel is. There is so much to look at, just walking around on the first floor which is the size of a small shopping mall (it was more than a quarter mile walk from my hotel room to the convention center, according to my fitbit). . . I thought the room was very cozy and nice-- I loved the walk-in shower/tub. Housekeeping kept me well-supplied with little shampoos/lotions. Wifi is free for the basic level, or you can pay $49 (!!!) to double the speed for 48 hours.. I wasn't much a fan of the touch-screen remote to control all of the lights, TV, curtains, etc. because the touch pad was sensitive and would sometimes skip past the channel I was trying to get to, and the lighting setup was confusing. Go to turn off some lights and it ends up turning off EVERYTHING and shutting the curtains. . . The pool is decent, but definitely more adult-oriented (no slides or fun stuff for kids). . The gym was great -- they provide towels and free water bottles. It's a large gym so there are plenty of machines available. . . The convention center was gorgeous and, I'm not sure if this is a reflection on the hotel or the convention I attended, but they provided refreshments and snacks at every break (so every hour) and the breakfasts and lunches were the same food you would get in The Buffet (AKA super yummy without having to fork out $$$).
Really nice centrally located resort hotel and casino. Compared to some hotels it wasn't as smokey. The building is airy and has a lot of art. It also has a lot of food to choose from. They are all pricey restaurants, so be prepared to pay a lot for your meals. We were here as a family so we didn't get to the casinos. The hotel room was beautiful. Simple design. Comfy bed and nice bedding. Combined shower and bath tub. The neat thing was the controls for the lights, curtains, room temperature and TV. The control panel is by the bed. Starbucks is located on the Promenade level. Or you head over the the other Starbucks at The Crystals is which is connected to the Aria. It is a super fancy mall with high end brands (Prada, Gucci, Miu Miu, Stella McCartney, Hermes, Tom Ford, etc). If you are looking for not mainstream shopping, the Mile Long mall is about a 15 minute walk. As well as mainstream food.  As for this place being good for families, there is the pool, walking around the strip (my daughter loved the M and M store down the road), or riding the tram. Others or bring some things to keep kids entertained (tablet, small toys, coloring books). Overall this resort is clean, safe and isn't as smokey.
Just finished an awesome 3 - night stay ... Overall great! Never felt that 'overcrowded' feeling I oi ft en get at the offer large Vegas resorts.  Staff was consistently great. Food was delicious (especially the 3am pizza at 550 (sp?)).. . Only two things bugged me;  no in room coffee in the am and the room remote was cool but a pain to change the tv. (not so bad,  I mean, who goes to Vegas to watch TV? )
Unauthorized Charges on my Credit Card:. . I booked a reservation at the Aria and ended up cancelling that one and setting up a new reservation after finding a better deal for being an MLife gold member.  However, the Aria still charged me a deposit for two reservations and refuses to assist in the removal of the other charge.  Their phone help has been giving me the runaround.  I'm now on the phone with my credit card company to get them involved.  I have to say this is incredibly disappointing and leaving a very bad taste in my mouth.  I'm hoping this situation can be rectified and I get the chance to enjoy my stay in a few weeks. Until then, I recommend double checking your credit card statements for unauthorized charges!
Overall, our 5 night stay here was pleasant. The room was nice, and because it was my birthday they sent up some macarons. . . The cons: . Shortly into our stay we noticed that one of the bathroom sinks wasn't draining properly. We aren't big complainers so we just shrugged and started using the second sink instead. However, by the 2nd or 3rd day, both sinks were clearly clogged and it would take around 30 minutes to drain. My husband would shave, and because it took SO long to drain, the hair would still be there once the water finally drained-- it was gross, to put it shortly. We decided to talk to the management in the morning (to see if we could get upgraded or moved to a different room with properly working sinks). . They claimed that they couldn't move us to a different rooms because there weren't any available-- which is interesting because we had just seen a huge line of people checking out, and in addition to that, it was a week day which is when hotels are less busy.  . Instead, they offered to send maintenance up and gave us a $50 dining credit. We assumed the sinks would be fixed right away, but it was already late into the afternoon and the maintenance person didn't show up, so we called the front desk again. They fixed it by that evening. . Honestly, it would've been nice to have gotten a discount on our stay since we had to go through a hassle in getting our sinks fixed. Oh well!
This hotel has great service and amenities. I was thoroughly impressed during my stay. The gambling was on par for the other higher end casinos. My friends and I enjoyed Haze nightclub (entry included w/hotel stay). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the off strip location. However it is conveniently adjacent to the Cosmopolitan.
I booked Aria via Expedia promotion. It was great package deal of airfare and accommodation with $75 food/beverage credit!. . When we arrived, the Check-in service was quick and front staffs were friendly.. Our room was clean and comfortable, however, no safe in the room. The hotel room space around 500 sq ft, just a bit small than other hotels. . . The remote-controlled options in the room was interesting, it was difficult at times to get some things to operate the way I wanted them to. . . If they have promotion deal in the future, I probably would stay here again.
Stayed at Aria for 4 nights on New Years in a corner suite. Room was spacious with a foyer,  1/2 bath, sitting area (w/flat screen & desk), king bedroom, and bathroom. The sitting room had a butler's pantry with mini-bar and separate fridge that had an ice maker in it - had never seen that feature before in a mini-fridge and it was a great addition. Bedroom was average sized (not huge, but spacious enough that we weren't tripping over each other). The bed was the best I've ever slept in. In fact, we're considering purchasing one from the Aria "at home" site. The only thing lacking was closet space.. . The standard rooms have a big armoire area when you first enter, but that is not replicated in the suites. Instead we had a smaller closet and a dresser. The dresser had a mirror hung over it, which was a bit of a waste of space since you have two mirrors in the main bath, one in the  1/2 bath, and a full mirror over the butler's pantry. Would suggest that they replace the dresser/mirror combo with a full-sized standing armoire. The bathroom was fabulous. Two vanities with lots of storage (including a drawer). A free-standing whirlpool tub and glassed in shower w/rainshower head. I thought it was a steam shower at first due to the glass and in-shower bench, but it isn't. The toilet probably cost more than my first car --- had a control panel on the wall with heated seat, various "washing" options, and a dryer. As most other reviews have noted, the whole room is controlled via a control panel. . . The spa was incredible. It's $30/day to use the workout facilities and spa area. Kind of steep, but they waive the fee if you get a spa treatment. You can also purchase 3 days for $80 and it's good for use for up to 1 year. I didn't get any treatments, but I did use the gym and the spa. You are provided a locker with a digital lock, robe, and flip flops (standard for any good spa). There's a steam room, sauna, large hot tub, smaller hot tub, and cold plunge pool in the gender-specific locker rooms. The outdoor deck adjoining both locker rooms has a hydrotherapy pool that overlooks their Liquid pool --- this was my favorite part of the spa. In the co-ed area there is the shio salt room and ganbanyoku beds. I really didn't get the point of the salt room. You just sit in there on these vibrating chairs and absorb the air. The ganbanyoku beds are basically hot marble slabs that you lay on. They were surprisingly comfortable and very relaxing. The locker rooms also have an extensive collection of sodas, teas, coffee, water, and fruit selection (included in cost). They are also equipped lotions, razors, combs, toothbrushes, hair gels, hair dryers, etc so that you don't have to bring anything with you. . . The casino is not huge, but it's not small either. Blackjack and craps start at $10 during the day. Most lower-limit BJ is dealt via auto-dealer (boo). Poker room never looked very busy. Drink service is good at the tables, just so-so at slots. Ate at the cafe (Vettro) for one meal. It was pricey, but decent quality. It was also about 2am and the entertainment provided via the people-watching was worth the price of the meal alone. Also ate at the Wolfgang Puck Brassiere in Crystals (adjoining Aria). Very good and not unreasonably priced. Checking in wasn't too terrible and we were able to get into a room around 1pm. The only big issue that I had with Aria was the check out process. I just don't understand how such a technologically advanced resort doesn't offer expedited checkout via the TV. We had to actually go downstairs and stand in line to checkout. I don't get it....even Holiday Inn Express offers TV checkout. Weird. Overally, a great place. It's less than a 5 minute walk to the strip - probably even faster than navigating through MGM. We've stayed at multiple resorts in Vegas (MGM, Monte Carlo, Palazzo, Mirage, TheHotel at MBay, etc) and I doubt that we will ever stay anyplace but Aria again. Comfortable rooms, great casino, amazing food selection, and convenient location make it a winner for us.
Booked a room here this past summer. I was delighted with the view of the room. The room was big enough for two or more people. I had the room to myself but did have friends over, and it was not crowded. This room definitely made me want to lay down and enjoy the room itself. The restroom was great, very spacious. The toilet had its own little door for privacy. The shower was small but there was a bath tub. Did not use the tub, so no comment there. The casino itself was big and well kept. There is a bakery place downstairs, with delicious crepes. Be ware, the morning lines are long. Plan ahead. Will stay here when i do come back. First time in Vegas had to stay at Aria. Treat yourself!
