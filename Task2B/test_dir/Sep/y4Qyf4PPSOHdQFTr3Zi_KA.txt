It nice in here but I never win in here  I just don't know why I have no luck.
Man. We had such a weird stay at this place. My husband's family is local and we were looking for a nearby resort to stay at for visits. We are skeptical as to whether we found it at Red Rock. . The pros are the staff. A lil' shout out to Ronnie who took care of us when no one else seemed able. Also, Britney at the pool really tried to get us our food, against all odds; we appreciated that. . FRIDAY, 8/29: So, let's start with check-in. When I got to our room the CD player was broken and there was an old, half used bottle of lotion left by the bed. Nasty. So, I called the front desk. I wish I remembered the name of the manager who "helped" me. I think her name began with an "s", she was around 5'2" with long dark brown hair. She sucked. . Her first question was short, "Well, what do you want us to do?" First, I'd like you to stop being a bitch. Barring that, could I please have a new room? She offered to sendsomeone up to clean the room again and to look at our CD player. If I wanted to wait around for housekeeping and a maintenance man, I would have hung out with my landlord for the weekend. It was 8:30, I just wanted to settle in for a few minutes, shower, and pick up my husband at the airport. . I asked for a room change, which really seemed to put her out. And when I added that our room was overlooking a parking garage and was there any way we could have a better view. she cut me off numerous times, assuming she had some idea of what I was going to say. We didn't care if we were looking at the pool or Red Rock--I was perfectly happy to look at the strip, I just preferred not to look at Level 4 of the East Garage. . Long story short: We were eventually moved and got a better room, but not before the the manager unloaded her obvious stress on me at the start of my "relaxing" weekend. I really wish I remembered her name. She was working Friday, August 29 at 8:30 pm. That's all I've got. . SATURDAY, 8/30: On to Saturday. We get a couple's spa massage package. When my massage therapist calls my name, she followed through by snapping her fingers, saying in a chirpy voice, "We are just trucking through these!" That is NOT the first thing I want to hear before a massage. You're going to TRUCK through my hour of relaxation??? And truck she did. She was *fine*, (good pressure, adequate technique. Didn't really listen to my specific requests though)   but about 10 minutes before the end of my massage she says, "I'll be right back!" Is gone for two literal minutes (a long time in paid massage time), comes back and gives me the roughest head massage to finish. Seriously, I've had noogies from my brother that were more relaxing. The kicker is that she took two minutes out of my massage to deal with "maintenance issues", but didn't give me two more minutes at the end. . Whatever. I headed back to the spa, with a plan to relax in the jacuzzi only to find a layer of blackened scum floating on the top. Gross. . We head back up to our hotel room with a plan to hang out in our room tub and drink some bourbon. . When we get back, we realize housekeeping hadn't refreshed our glasses, so we call down for clean glasses and an extra robe. An hour passes... we call down again. 30 minutes pass... we call again. 20 minutes pass and we get our requests--finally learning that they had asked housekeeping to bring us our stuff. She had been cleaning other rooms. . SUNDAY, 8/31. We go out for breakfast. Come back. Our room is cleaned... and our housekeeper had respectfully chosen to leave our dirty bourbon glasses from Friday and Saturday there for us. Apparently she thought we were taking up a collection. . MONDAY, 9/1: Our last day. Housekeeping comes knocking at 8 am. We hear the room key and have to wake up after a VERY LATE night, to turn the paddle lock. Pass out. 8:45, housekeeping is back. Granted, there is a DND button by the door, so it was partially our fault. But... 8 am? We're checking out in three hours.. We decide to spend our last few hours hanging out by the pool. When we get there we want to order breakfast by the pool. Only "today only" they don't start serving until 10. Totally fine, but it seems like a bad call on management's part. It's a long weekend. A very busy long weekend. This is generally the last day of people's stay. Why would you make brunch an hour later? . Anyway, not a bad weekend overall but, as you can see, there were quite a few glitches here and there. Also, the staff at the Red Rock were consistently helpful and pleasant (except for that stupid bitch manager... Friday, Aug. 29 @ 8:30 p.m. HATE HER)--so that's a plus. This place is fine, but it's not anything more than that. It's a shame because we live in LA and since my husband's family lives in Summerlin, we were looking for some place close to stay during our regular visits. Sadly, we may have to continue on with our search.
This is my 2nd time staying the resort is nice and family friendly EXCEPT for the pool area. If there is an event which happened twice while we stayed they will close the pool early and everyone has to leave. There was no notice given either. The pool closes regularly at 7 p.m. And when they close early at 3 now where do you take the kids? I give half a star on that basis and I was told that there was only an assistant manager on hand and he was busy the day I complained.
If I could give this a negative ten star review, I would love to! The staff is extremely rude. Everyone walks around like they didn't want to be there with long faces except the receptionist but still. Receptionist was really nice, but would of been nice if she check the schedule first. . . I went in ten minutes early, waiting for an interview. I was not told the person had a client, and won't be done until 1230, and the interview was at 11! After the receptionist went to the back and came back up, one of the ladies, if that's what you want to call her, receptionist told her the situation. Instead of giving an attempt of apology or try to fix the situation at first, she called me a liar a few times, and I had the wrong day for the interview, it was yesterday. The person who was suppose to interview me called me yesterday after 430, so how did I get the days mixed up? Last time I check, 430pm is after 11am of the same day. Very rude and unprofessional. If this is how you treat a potential employee, is this how you treat your current employees and guests?
Update on the Red Rock, on day #2 (of a four night stay) I get an email saying my reservation has been canceled! Very strange since it was pre-paid. Go the the front desk where the perky young lady tells me they had a "glitch" in the their system and they had to cancel some reservations, and then reinstate them. Problem is the email never said anything about re-instating the reservations. Note to hotel manager - learn how to communicate with your customers.
The wife and I stayed her for a few days last week for our anniversary.  The hotel is nicely decorated and the staff is friendly.  The rooms are decent sized, not large, not small just kind of in the middle.  The resort has ALMOST everything you could ask for to keep you there without having to go to the strip, (casino, spa, food court, upscale restaurant, movie theater, bowling alley), but the one thing they are missing is entertainment.  The act that they had coming when we were there was Asia.  I guess that would be a cool show if you're in your 50's.. . The spa is magnificent, great decor, nice gym.  There's even a private lap pool that is adults only so you can just sit by the pool or get in some laps without having to worry about kids getting in the way.. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-rock-casino-resort-and-spa-las-vegas-2?select=nSRyzMe55dTLRVOgLkvxvw#nSRyzMe55dTLRVOgLkvxvw. . The pool area is very nice.  There are probably about 10 different pools you can get into so if you don't want to be around the crowded main pool you can take a dip in one of the smaller pools around it.  The pool cocktail waitresses all wear skimpy red bikinis, AWESOME.  There are even a couple of gambling tables by the poolside bar that have dealers that also wear red bikinis, also AWESOME.. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-rock-casino-resort-and-spa-las-vegas-2?select=nSRyzMe55dTLRVOgLkvxvw#_eJhlclYL4iSG9GQDWpLLg. . All in all the Red Rock is a nice little resort.  The staff isn't quite as attentive as at the Encore, (I keep comparing everywhere I stay in Vegas to Encore because it was so fabulous) bu they were very nice.  About the only drawback to Red Rock is that it's so far from the strip and the shuttle only runs every other hour.  If they had shuttles that ran to the strip every hour it would be much more convenient.  Many times we had food or show reservations and had to get there over an hour early because the shuttle times weren't very convenient.
My wife and I love gambling at the Red Rock as it is a beautiful place however getting a rooms there is another story. You make a reservation for a room like us as we had a reservation for a non smoking king room and when we got to the front desk they told us that they only had queen beds in which they can't guarantee that you will get what you booked for as that is not at all the way to do business. They also tried to charge us for the room in which we were not going to stay in at all unless we got what we wanted as I had to fight the hotel manager for a full refund. A reservation should guarantee exactly what kind of room you are requesting with no if's and or butts. These people obviously do not understand what a reservation is for and the purpose of it as that is a lot of bullshit that you don't get what you requested as we ended up going elsewhere to stay.
*Housekeeping department needs bigimprovement *. . As a local,  I actually would give their casino five stars. Great atmosphere,  two Starbucks, food court,  and movie theater, all in all its a great place to hang out. But this review is merely for their rooms. . . I've stayed at Red Rock three times in this few years. The first time when I checked in around midnight,  the room was dirty and  looked like housekeeper left in the middle of the cleaning. How can you not have the room ready at midnight? it's not like I did early checkin. . The second and third time when I stayed at Red Rock,  the rooms were ready but only looked clean on the surface. There was dust everywhere,  on the mirror,  tables,  and bathroom. The sheet gave me rashes. . . It just seems like their Housekeeping department doesn't have a schedule of full cleaning,  they just come in make your bed,  pick-up trash and leave. It doesn't look like a professional cleaning service at all. . . I will still come to play at Red Rock Casino but will not give their rooms another chance. Stay at JW Marriott if you are looking for a better hotel room in Summerlin.
My husband and I stayed last night and we agreed that we will not be staying here again. It wasn't a horrible stay, but it was very overpriced.  The bed was pretty comfortable but it was super short -- not sure how a tall person would be able to sleep without their feet hanging over the edge.  The decor was nice, especially in the hotel lounge area and nightclub/restaurants, but the furnishings inside the room were not that great: some of the lamps and light switch plates were crooked on the wall and the amenities (soaps, etc) were subpar.  The shower was very weak. When we checked in, we were given someone else's rewards card by mistake: oops. The worst parts:. 1. The constant, continuous, very LOUD, AWFUL pop? music.....inside and outside -- there are speakers in the parking lots so as you can hate it as you leave (we left at 4am - yep, that's nice for the customers...)  My hearing was definitely damaged. . . 2.  The casino is SMOKE-Y!! My clothes were immediately saturated and I fought a headache the entire time.  There are signs marking the non-smoking slot machines, but the signs were generally ignored. People lit up everywhere. Ugh.. . 3. Service was mixed. Most people were nice and helpful, but we didn't appreciate that there was no posted information stating what the hours/prices for the unlimited buffet were and everyone had to stand in line for 30 minutes only to be unpleasantly surprised by the menu prices (sign in casino -- $14.99 -- reality on Sat. at 4pm: $25+/person.) Why do the cashiers have to deal with all this negative energy upon ringing people up?  An easy solution: get a sign that shows hours and prices!!  The buffet was okay, not great.  Not one person I saw in the casino had a drink and we were only offered a drink once.  We were approached many, many times, however, about getting a rewards card. Bleah. No thanks.. . 4. The pool area was confusing -- lots of little shallow pools? Uh....ok..looks like a setup for some weird parties, not swimming. . . Meh says it all.
