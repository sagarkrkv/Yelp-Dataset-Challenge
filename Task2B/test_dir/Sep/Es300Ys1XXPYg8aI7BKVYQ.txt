Usually, whenever I'm in Las Vegas with friends we always hit up XS and are never disappointed. Came here for New Years Eve once to see Deadmaus and it was fabulous. Unfortunately, this past weekend I came here for my bachelorette party. All of my girls and I bought tickets for the David Guetta show. We got in line at midnight and got inside the club at 12:45pm which wasn't too long of a wait. Once we got inside it was terrible. The club was so packed!! And not in a good way. There was no room to move. I've never seen it like that before, but granted it was Labor Day weekend with David Guetta. The place felt like a fire hazard though. Honestly, if a fire or emergency would have broken out I'm pretty sure people would have gotten trampled and died. It was extremely overcrowded and unsafe. I'm surprised they let that many people in. We had one drink and then decided to leave.
Giving it 4 stars because it has potential to be a 5 star but I seriously felt like they let too many people in the night I went. Monday June 23 (day after edc) it was beyond packed too forever to get drinks. 1 hour to get drinks umm that's a little too much. But overall I had a great time. More like the time of my life haha. Note to self don't go to Vegas when edc is happening
Only con would be:. . Understand that stamps come off in the pool. The security nearly threatened me when I tried to tell him. Get waterproof stamps. This is a pool club. Duh.. . Other than that:. . Best club in the world.
Seriously waited 2 hours in line to pay $55 cover to gain entry. Once we got in the club was not packed enough to justify a 2 hour wait. I fully understand that these clubs get busy and need to control the flow of people. This was excessive. It was only done to line the pockets of the bouncers and door men that were greased from average Joe's sick of waiting in line. The club itself was great and I enjoyed my time there (finally) but I will never return to a place where I was treated so poorly even paying a $55 entrance fee.
Horrible experience. A buddy of mine got a table at this club, I stood in line for 2 hours just to join the table. When I finally made it I the front (after most people in front of me kept leaving) they tell me there are no more table joins allowed. Bouncers (aka hosts), were letting all kinds of people in. They were taking money left and right to let huge groups in that weren't even standing in line. It was very frustrating, very unprofessional, I know they're there to make money but man, you gotta draw the line somewhere. People were getting out of this club and saying that it was impossible to move around as they oversold the venue. If you didn't have a table and tried to get a drink, good luck. Better buy 5 of them at once if you want to get drunk.. That was my second and my last time going to XS. If I could give 0 stars I would, but yet again, they don't give a crap and this review will probably won't even make a dent.
I love Vegas nightclubs and XS is definitely one of the best ones there is. The venue has an indoor area along with an outdoor pool area and it's absolutely gorgeous. If you go on a busy weekend, expect it to be absolutely packed so make sure you get in line somewhat early. My girlfriends and I got in on the guestlist thanks to Michelle, who is a wonderful promoter that always replies quickly and is very helpful with getting you what you need. She usually hooksit up with free drink tickets too! Amazing! If you need to find a promoter for XS, I would definitely recommend her. Her number is (908) 770-3570 and you can text her. . . Minus one star for some rude bartenders, and also for it being so packed sometimes that it takes half an hour to swim the crowd to get to the bathroom. Also, if you leave at prime leaving time aka 4am, expect a long ass line for the taxi!
WOW.. . My boyfriend and I went to see Skrillex on 8/29 at XS and it was a phenomenal show. First of all, the venue is absolutely flawless. It has reserved booths, couches, tables, cabanas and a bar in the middle of the pool area. It also has a perfect-sized dance floor in front of the DJ stand. It may get a bit crowded (they do let about 11,000 people in during the course of one night 10PM-4AM) but what's the nightlife like without getting pushed and shoved once or twice ;) Be sure to get there early though, or you may be waiting in line for an extended amount of time!. . The service is great from what I experienced. The staff is constantly clearing finished drinks around the club and maintaining it as much as they can. The bartenders were super good-looking and very sweet! . . The DJ before Skrillex played a good show too. I actually enjoyed when he was playing a bit more because less people were on the dance floor and my boyfriend and I got to stay upfront all night. It was amazing. Skrillex killed it, obviously, and the lights/effects/bass were all up to par.. . Thank you XS, for a fantastic time!
5 stars for the show, 1 star for service lack and overloaded capacity.. . Went to the Skrillex show last weekend, staying at the hotel we had access to the hotel entry line.  It was an easy-to-follow process and easy to get in.  Once you're in, stay.  If you leave, there's a good chance you won't get back in!  To say it was crowded was an understatement, it was a complete safety hazard!! If you were to fall down on the floor, there's a good chance you'd be trampled.  The music was awesome, but after things get going, it's hard to get any kind of service.  $20.00 drinks at a bar that is 5 people deep means you aren't likely to get a drink either.  If you open a tab, your credit card will be held at one of the bars, and you're then required to only access that 1 bar.  Yes, the club is making money hand over fist, but it's unfortunate it takes away from any kind of customer service.. . Unfortunate the star DJ doesn't show up until 1:30 AM, especially when the hotel line requires you to be in the club by 11P.  Unless you spend $4,000 to $10,000 (no joke) for inside table service, there is nowhere for you to sit.  Even after 4-5 hours of dancing, everyone needs a break and somewhere to park it for a few moments.. . Will I return?   Yes.  It was a great show, just hope the club management takes a moment to improve the end-user experience.
This is my favorite club in Las Vegas! The venue is massive and has a great atmosphere. The instant you walk in, you're amazed with the atmosphere of the place. Great decor, great service, great ambiance. . . The venue has an outdoor pool area that you have to walk through to get to the indoor area. It has two bars inside and one outside. They book great acts and every time I have been here, I've had a flawless experience. Just be sure to get in line around 9:30 because it gets pretty packed.
Fuck Sid. Worst promoter ever!!!! But deadmau5 is a resident DJ and will blow your mind. XS rocks. Sid blows.
Fun night club in the Wynn/Encore casino. Used Michelle as my promoter, great girl. Got 2 free drink tickets and in for free for me and my two girlfriends. Definitely recommend using her, just text (908) 770-3570 for the hook up. Quick responses too which is much appreciated. Xs is a fun crowd lots of seating inside and outside. Outside is around the pool and some chairs/lounges are used at night in the pool (you don't get wet). Fun times in Vegas!
This is the nightclub that all others are compared to.  Hands down the king of nightlife.
XS is the most stunning club out of the Vegas clubs. I have a preference for clubs that have a pool and a large outdoor area. I feel trapped and claustrophobic in clubs that don't have an outdoor area. However, the dance floor indoors is small for a club this size. I can't get over the funky feet smell indoors every time I go there too. It gets super crowded on Fridays and Saturdays so I try to avoid those nights.. . I had the most fun during EDC week on a Monday. Hot, friendly Europeans that night and people more likely there for the DJ. Most of the time, the club is filled with my Asian people. Lol.. . RE: Their staff. The promoters I have dealt with have been polite, returns my texts promptly, get me in with a drink ticket or two, and every once in a while, to sit at a table which I haven't gotten a chance to go to yet. The wait on weekdays are not bad at all. They go by pretty fast. No issues with the bouncers and staff.
Went for Sunday night swim, beautiful grounds, I didn't get in the pool but I felt the water it was nice and warm. I'm not totally in to techno music but it's what I expected from vegas. Thanks to Michelle for getting us on the guest list with free drink tickets! Give her a call 908-770-3570 Facebook: www.facebook.com/michelle.vivalasguestlist instagram: Michelle_vegasnightlife
Tips:. . 1.night pool party really means you can come in your bathing suit ( i know it feels weird to do so but if you want to enjoy the pool like many people did, do it!). . 2. you rolling with all of your 7 boys? well unless you get bottle service it might be a while to get in, so you don't mind...ahem...asking the bouncer if their is a faster way in ($20 a person), then you will be waiting a while. we were in a line of about 30 dudes, all the woman were already inside, so we paid the "express" fee and got in right away...hella worth it.. . . . . The place is huge and i really like how they have set up the place, no matter where you are, its a party in every section. From pool floaty animals and things, to craps table, to badass DJ and effects inside. no matter why youdecide to come here, its gonna be a good time!
Wow this place has changed since I was here last time. Most las Vegas clubs are pretty cool at taking care of locals but not XS. I came to XS with my bf for night swim. When we walked in the line, we made the bouncers know that we are local. They said the line will be about an hour but we will get in for free. Since we are getting in for free, I asked is there anyway we can get in the faster line since we will be taken care of. One of the bouncer said there is a way and he said that with douche look on his face. I didn't know what it means until about an hour wait in line where no body was moving except a few people and we wondered why. We discovered that some bouncers are asking people if they want in faster line, they can pay $25 extra. I was curious to whether that $25 would go to the club or not. But ofcourse, it went straight to the bouncer pocket. I believe in tipping the bouncer sometimes when they are nice to you and give you good service but this is straight up asking people for money and scamming. They are obviously holding line so they can ask people for money. I am a girl so I don't have a problem getting in but I still think this is the unethical scam that this people are running. I studied hospitality and I am not sure what kind of business these club management is allowing it's employees to do. I hope that this issue will be fixed.. . I am not a cheap person and I will take care of people but not to rude, awful service people. I am not gonna recommend this club to my out of town friends unless things are getting better. This is embarrassing to the entire service culture. This is supposed to be 5 stars property but I am not seeing this.
Oooolala! I have been here for both the nightclub and for the XS Night Swim. What a great time! Such a cool idea. Go on a less popular night; the less crowded the pool is, the better. . It's such a gorgeous place. They have. A huge dance floor and an outdoor area with casino tables and the huge pool. This is by far my favorite club in Vegas. . If you don't get bottle service and have to make the line, don't worry bc it goes very quickly although it looks very long.
We came, we saw, we destroyed! The only way to do a bachelor party is to go to XS and drop most of your cash here vs going to any strip club. We (12 guys) showed up around 10 30 and only got in around 11. There were several check points and lots of money passing hands just for us to get to our table!! Yeah that's right,  we were still in line even when we had bottle service reserved. Come early because the tables are first come. The girls are gorgeous including the waiters. We jumped in the pool during Zedd and no one stopped us. Started an epic pool party. In all my friends and I agree that this was one of our greatest nights together! . . "Ya"ll don't drink this, this here is for the bitchez", separate bottles for people because it's the greatest night of your life! . . Tips. wear dress shoes,.  don't try to buy drinks for girls, they'll hang out with you if you have a table (no place to sit). try to keep up with your stuff if you jump in the pool, will get lost/stolen
Had fun with my friends. We came here to watch Zedd perform, and he was amazing. The venue is nice. You can dance inside or chill outside by the pools. Fresh air at clubs is always a plus in my books.
Got bottle service here last weekend with the guys and it was awesome.  The bouncers were rude, but I think they always are to guys so its nothing that im not used to.  The girls that brought out our bottles were smoking and so were all the others hanging around our table.
everything you've heard is true. just go. and show up really early (regardless of which night of the week it is).. . but in particular, go for the sunday night swim. it is like nothing you've ever been to.
XS is the best nightclub in Vegas! If you don't want spend a lot of money put your name on the guest list. I went to Vegas two times and I contacted the promoter Michelle (+19087703570) and we didn't pay to go to the club and in addiction we had 2 free drinks each person. I really recommend it!
Best place to club when in vegas! Went for a last minute getaway with my bf and michelle hooked us up! No waiting in line and hooked us up with drinks. I love her.. . Hit up my girl Michelle for guestlists and tables. She will take care of u! Promise!! 9087703570
Great club! Awesome lights and friendly service! Pricey pricey drinks, I recommend getting drunk gambling first.
After visiting Tyrst first, XS looks like a lesser twin sister. I understand the whole "ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality, but I was disappointed in how it looks virtually the same, maybe a little bigger, but definitely with less wow factor. Encore/Wynn group, you could have done better! . We (4 girls & 1 guy) were able to get on guest list for Skrillex on Monday night. We saw that the entry was listed as $25/$35 respectively each. We were comped (even the guy) so that was nice. The line/entry area was crazy, as in I felt like I was waiting in line for a Disney ride with the way it snaked around in a sizable room. . Overall the experience was ok. I personally was more amazed at how many people were there on a Monday night. I was on vacation, but were all the other people on vacation too? And is every young person made of gold in LAS? It seems like dropping several Gs on a random Monday is a common occassion.. All in all, it's a great club especially comparing to anything anywhere else I've been to. Great sound and light. But comparing to Tyrst, it was a little underwhelmed.
IDK...I say it's a 3.5. The obvious statement of yes it is a beautiful club. Still not sure how all the promoter stuff works but we got in. It was a whooping $70 on the night of David Guetta. It was pretty fun and all but the unknown DJ was way better than David Guetta and I paid to see David Guetta for like an hour since he wasn't that good..... . The outside of the club is beautiful and vastly big. The nice outside pool is a nice addition to the club too. Still paying $70 for this club made me gave the same rating as Light despite me enjoying my experience at XS more. Also...although it was a vastly large club, at some point in the club it's like a zombie horde has arrived in the club and you will not be able to move as well as you think you could. Fighting through people if you ever want to go to the restroom, paying $$$ for drinks that are 1/3 the price outside of the club, and giving so much more space to the people that has seatings. To conclude, the dance floor is quite small in the inside because about 30% are closed off for the people that have seatings which is really annoying and you just squish off with strangers you don't know. . . Will i be back? Possibly...but not sure if i'm down to pay $70 again.
A club you must go to when you visit LV.. Sadly its mostly edm, house or whatever.. But its nice during the summer especially being able to walk around the pool and not freeze to death.. One thing I hate about this place is all the rude people. Is it really that hard to say 'sorry' or 'excuse me'????? I guess i need to start being rude because i get weird stares for being nice!. Drink prices are outrages! We ordered the same drinks at two different bars and the prices were about a $15 difference!. Came during iHeart Radio weekend and got lucky enough to see usher and chris brown perfrom together! sure made up for the rude jerks in there.
It's crowded, well run, impressive, and can either be very cheap or expensive (depending on how hydrated you are).. . Last night me and my girlfriend went to see Zedd.  The couple we were going with were on the promoter's list, so entry was free.  They definitely like women in this place because they kept yelling for all the ladies to move to the front of the line and all the men to move to the back.  With an even ratio, they were fine letting us go on and the line moved quickly.  They also handed the women a free drink card.. . If this was it, I'd say this place was awesome.  But once we got in, the club interior was packed, and there was no seating outside, except for bottle service.  When my girlfriend got drinks, I asked her to snag us 4 waters.  $40 later, we had 2 pints of water.  That killed the experience.  I figure there was no cover and they did give the ladies drink cards, so there was plenty of value, but it was a disappointing surprise.
j just came back from XS....  and back in my room in Encore.  My shoes are off and I am looking forward to room service.  Wow.... I must say David Fogg as an opening DJ, you really stunk it up.  What were you doing?  Hip-hop?  EDM?  It was painful listening to your crappy set.  How in the world did a classy place like XS allow you to torture the high paying customers for 2 hours.  When you finally left and the main DJ came on and tried to give you props, it was total crickets and no one applauded.  I bought tickets in advance for XS which is a great club, but I came early ~ 11pm.  DO NOT COME EARLY!  The opening DJs suck.  Come around 1:30am when the amateurs get off the stage.  XS is a great club but make sure you don't have to listen to crappy opening DJs.
