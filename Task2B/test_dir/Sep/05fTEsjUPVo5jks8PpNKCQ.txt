As a visitor going off strip is usually only done based on reputation, including the advice of locals and sites such as Yelp.. I am happy to report that Rollin Smoke more than lived up to it's great reputation. . We arrived a little early (11:30am) for lunch, which was fortunate given that we just got ahead of the locals and the lunch rush.. We ordered 4 different selections off the expansive menu and were all heartily pleased.. Great brisket and pulled pork, amazing flavour, delicious sides.. It is not fancy, mostly banquet seating but let's face it, BBQ is about taste, quality and selection. . For visitors without rental cars it is only a short taxi ride from the strip. . If you want a great BBQ experience at a reasonable price, Rollin Smoke is for you!
Yummm!! I can see why this place is so busy , best bbq I've had in vegas. I got the pulled piggy sandwich,  with the bacon potato salad. The pork just melts in your mouth!  It comes on a sesame seed bun which is alright , but delicious nonetheless.  My hubby got 1/2 rack of baby back ribs with cheesy mac and waffle fries. He hasn't said a word since he started eating ;) I tried it and let me tell you the ribs are smoked to perfection.  The mac and cheese is delightfully balanced , and the waffle fries are crispy and not too greasy.  Two thumbs up! Oh and we got it for around $37.00
Good barbecue is one of the most rewarding finds in the culinary world. First, one has to learn about the place, then one has to hunt it down, then one has to resist the urge to leave... because NO barbecue restaurant worth it's prices boasts the most upscale  atmosphere or structural amenities. . . But then the food comes; and one is suddenly more happy to be sitting at that grubby, sweaty little picnic table than they could have ever anticipated. . . So, that being said, Rolling Smoke Barbecue is the finest quintessential barbecue experience I've had in fifteen years in Las Vegas. . . I learned about Rolling Smoke from one of their newest team-members, "Chef" Nick. He's been a close friend of mine for years, and he has been doing an amazing job promoting the business. He greeted me when I came in, too, which was classy. . . The service otherwise was gracious and friendly, the Atmosphere was as modest as barbecue gold mines can get, and the food.... . Wow... The food.. . The ribs, brisket, and pork I purchased practically melted in my mouth, leaving behind only the subtle texture of the meats' not-so-subtle spice rub; a rub that thankfully doesn't overpower the undeniably robust flavors of the proteins themselves. . . ...A flavor that makes it completely understandable that the restaurant is perpetually inundated with a line of hungry patrons. Don't worry - though - the kitchen has it down and they churn out an order every fifty seconds or so.. . Oh, and at just over $15 (prior to well-earned gratuity), this barbecue meal is certainly worth the price. . . Please, go check this place out. It will leave you entirely satisfied and grateful that you stuck around.
Good smokey bbq with some very nice owners. Typically going to Vegas it's the same restaurants or small food/snack shops that keeps the stomach satisfied, but on the last trip a couple friends decided to come here for a birthday dinner. Upon reaching the premises my nose was hit with the mouth watering smell of bbq.. Our party of 18 or so people were given a spot at an empty room and were greeted withgreat enthusiasm and hospitality. My gf and I were probably the 4th to put in the order of the Outlaw burger and the Rib Plater special. After waiting in the room slowly everyone started to get their food and were enjoying the dinner while we waited. After coming in to check on us (forgot the gentlemen's name) he explained the food was forgotten or being remade, which I can't remember, but long story short they got us the food and also gave us a free A LA MODE Black berry cobbler.. . Rating of the burger and ribs. . -Jaw dropping sized burger filled with such tasty bbq flavor that's complimented with the onion strings (DROOOL). -Very flavorful sauce (More on the tangy side) on the ribs and the meat slides right off. -The cobbler is something that needs to be ordered either by you or someone in your party. I was so full after the burger and a few ribs but was able to have a bite off the cobbler and it was amazing. Full of flavor and just takes over all that meat/bbq flavor in your mouth.
Amazing BBQ, I had the BBQ chicken wrap. It was very good, but that alone wouldn't get me back. Its all about the greens! Best collard greens I've ever had. Place is small, but part of the charm. Definitely worth the visit!
It is not often that I give a BBQ restaurant five stars. I found the food to be very, very good. If this place was in KC or some other BBQ city, I'm not sure that I would give it five stars...Maybe I would. The meat (ribs, chicken, brisket, & pulled pork) was succulent, mouthwatering, flavorful, tender...I could go on and on. You get the picture. The sides (beans, mac & cheese, greens) were cooked perfectly with a southern flare. The sweet tea was oh so yummy. I didn't have a dessert, but I will next time. The service was fast and with a smile. The only thing that bothered me was the place was very smokey (the smell). It was a good thing, but it lingered in my clothes after I left. To most people, I think that is a good thing. To me, it's just one of those things that I perseverate on. LOL...I can't wait to go back.
This is really good food!  They really know how to make bbq!  I particularly like their bbq shrimp.  Brisket is pretty awesome too.  The employees are friendly also. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys good bbq.
As with anyone who has been to Vegas a few times, you grow sick of the options on the strip, so one of my goals was to find a few places off the beaten path for us to try this next time around. . . BBQ is really the reason I started yelping and everywhere I go, I usually seek out a BBQ place to try, so when I saw all the positive reviews of Rollin' Smoke, naturally I was a bit excited. . . After our first long night in Vegas, we decided to skip breakfast and hit up Rollin' Smoke for an early lunch. Our cabby didn't know where it was, but it was a fairly quick ride from the strip.. . Walking in, you are greeted with a glorious, thick, smoky smell that always accompanies good BBQ. As with all my BBQ reviews, I usually seek out a way to try out most of the meats, so we ordered the three Pit Specials (3 meats, 2 sides) and one order of the Beef Ribs. We quickly realized we ordered too much food for the four of us, but it was no matter, it was all delicious. The meats:. . The Pulled Pork - The pulled pork was flavorful and moist, with a moderate smoky flavor. If you like pulled pork, you won't be disappointed by this. . . The Hot Link Sausage - Despite how good the other meats were, the Hot Link made a good run to be one of my favorites. This isn't like most hot links you see which are red in color, both on the sausage meat and on the casing, with that annoying spicy flavor that seems to linger forever. These had a reddish-brown casing and a very delicious and unique flavor too them, with a nice spiciness as well. Definitely recommend. . . The Ribs - The baby backs were delicious. Moist, tender, fall off-the-bone good. They seasoning added some nice flavor as did the moderate-to-strong smokiness. Another awesome dish.. . The Brisket - The brisket we were served was from the lean side and had a nice smoke ring to it and despite being from the lean side, was not dry at all. Very solid brisket and only due to the greatness of the other dishes was this our least favorite. . . The Beef Rib - Holy crap, the other reviewers were not wrong. This thing is amazing. It should be called The Flinstone or Brontosaurus Rib. It is massive. It has an amazing bark, strong smokiness, and tons of meat. It wasn't too gristly either, like many beef ribs tend to be. You get two ribs for 15 bucks and you think that is steep until you receive them. That will be more than enough to fill you up. A must order here. . . The Sauce - I think good BBQ can be graded as to whether it needs sauce, and the BBQ here stands on its own. However, the sauce was pretty good if you like sauce. The rust-colored sauce starts out sweet and ends tangy and is fairly runny too. It is great for dipping and doesn't overpower the  meat. . . So the 4.5 star rating for Rollin' Smoke is spot on and consider this to be a 4.5 star review to match as well. This Arkansas-style BBQ just made it on my mandatory to-do list in Vegas for each trip. If you like BBQ, don't pass this place up.
Four of us stopped here for lunch after hiking yesterday.  This has been bookmarked for a long time so I was glad we were going here.. . We ordered on the right side where you enter and then waited at a table on the more dining room side.  I ordered the meat trio with pork, ribs, and hot link.  I also showed them my Yelp check in offer for a free pudding with a sandwich which they honored even though I didn't order a sandwich.  Since the trio is more expensive, I guess it doesn't matter.. . I could tell from the time we walked in that they did their own smoking.  The place is heavy with the smell of smoke.  In fact, the first thing I did when I got home was to change my shirt.. . The trio of meats was OK.  The pork was lukewarm at best and was dry.  It needed their BBQ sauce.   Two of us had gotten that and both were the same so there was something not right with the heating in the kitchen.  The meat fell off the ribs and was very good.  I'm surprised I liked them as much as I did.  The hot link was also good.  As a side I got the kicken beans but there was nothing these beans were going to kick.  They were just normal baked beans with some spice.. . The banana pudding was OK.  It was nothing special and I'm sure it comes from some kind of bulk make your own package.  The serve yourself soda was great.  I was really thirsty after the hike and I went back and refilled several times.. . I guess I sealed the deal yesterday and realized I'm really not a BBQ person.  Lunch was OK but it's nothing that I would crave nor go out of my way to get again.
I am so very glad I tried this place!!! I felt like I was in Texas and it was great!! . . I'm not gonna say more than TRY ROLLIN SMOKE BBQ!!!! You WILL NOT be disappointed when the cook brings your food out! GO HERE!!!
Sooooo good!  Our group went for lunch and you know it's gotta be good when there is a line-up out the door and into the parking lot.  Despite the crowd we ordered and were served within about 20 minutes.  Between us we tried the brisket, pulled pork and chicken.  Consensus was the brisket was the best but all were thoroughly enjoyed.  The atmosphere was pretty basics so don't dress up and expect to leave smelling a little"smokie"..... Very good and great price, you won't be disappointed.
I saw Rollin Smoke on the tv while in Vegas....decided to try something different.....what a disappointing meal. While trying to decide what to order a young very pleasant waitress/server offered a suggestion....can't remember the dish...but it had 3 diff kind of ribs, she said it would be enough for both myself and husband to share - I would strongly disagree the portions aren't that generous. An older man took our order...unfriendly, he'd be better staying in the back. The meal came with one drink...he slipped another $2 pop on the bill - the order came with a bun....in fact that is a slice of stale bread which the remainder of the meal is stacked upon...interesting! We also ordered a side of onion rings. Food arrived, minus onion rings - they would follow per server. The waffle fries were stone cold....I went to the front - grumpy guy wasn't there so I mentioned it to a server...she could've cared less, I offered her one to touch, it hadn't felt heat for some time, she declined, she said she'd get us fresh ones.....10 mins later, ribs gone - fries arrive - 3 mins later the worst onion rings arrived. I will say the ribs were good, but the kitchen obviously is disorganized and they need new frontline people. I will not follow the recommendations of any tv show again....McD's would have been a better choice for overall satisfaction.
Rolling in deliciousness! . . As a local, I have found it difficult to track down the best bbq in Las Vegas, but after walking into Rollin Smoke I was assured I had come to the right place. The intoxicating smell of authentic bbq smokiness gave my sense of smell a run for its money and my hope was that my taste buds would follow along in happiness. I was so pleasantly surprised as the ribs, pulled pork, brisket and chicken arrived at our table. We ordered the four meat, three side combo to be able to try a little bit of everything. The sides we picked included the jalapeno cole slaw, bbq beans, mac and cheese and an extra side of dirty Vegas rice and cornbread. You know you've come to the right spot when everything you try is finished with an mmmm sound, a smile and a look of agreeable satisfaction to the person you are dining with. Just to describe a few, the brisket had an intense flavorful smoke on it you could see and was tender and delicious. The ribs were perfectly large and full of rich meat with a sweet intense spice rub. The jalapeno cole slaw was crunchy, a little spicy and had just enough dressing without drowning it. The mac and cheese was the perfect cheese sauce to noodle ratio with noodles cooked just right without drying out the dish. The cornbread was cooked perfectly,  sweet and salty with a warm layer of melted butter on the bottom that made it a little more guilty of being just so good. We look forward to going back and letting our friends know this is where they can find the best bbq in town. Thanks for bringing great bbq to Vegas!
I eat BBQ all over the U.S. during my travels. This was excellent!  Hand rubbed with great flavor. Not as spicy as Texas BBQ, but way better than the St. Louis and other sweet sauces.  The hush puppies were deep fried to a golden brown. The Jalapeno, cornbread and spices inside were the perfect blend of sweet, spicy and texture. . . I had the Trio of Brisket, BBQ spare ribs and pulled pork. All were melt in your mouth tender with the flavor profile you expect and desire for good BBQ. . . We will definitely be back!!!
Though I'm not a big fan of the sauces. The food is really good and it's priced right
I've been here several times for lunch because it's close to work and the food! It's a location that leaves a lot to be desired. Very sketchy area, no ac in main room, terrible and tiny parking lot and I wonder about the neighboring businesses and the cleanliness of the area. I was introduced to Rollin Smoke by their food truck at a convention I worked. Their ribs and brisket have amazing taste, flavor and texture. I just wish they would change locations now that they've grown in popularity and business.
Back here again!  If you guys are into bbq and are in Vegas, check it out.  Great service and awesome brisket and ribs.  Always friendly staff is awesome and the prices are more than reasonable!  Missed the owner this trip.  She's normally there all the time cleaning up and speaking to all her guests.
Stopped here after a concert... They were out of everything we wanted to try, we were left ordering hot dogs. The food was super greasy. Tried drying the fries with napkins due to them being soaked in oil. We had to just throw them away. The hush puppies were actually really good. I don't think we will be going back.
Mmmmm. sooooo goooooood!. . Every chance I get I sneak away here on my lunch break from work.. The meat is so tender and flavorful. I must say I use a gallon of their delicious barbecue sauce on my pulled piggy sandwich. Sorry not sorry. When I get back to work everyone is so jealous when they smell how amazing I smell from all that smoked barbecue goodness.. . Prices are great and you get a whole lot of delicious food. Sides are pretty delectable too. I typically go with the corn bread though, it comes with two big squares.. . I leave this place so happy, full and smelling of smoked meat but it's so worth it!. . Not to mention the staff are super friendly and will remember you since you'll become a regular here.
This place just feels like a BBQ joint. Doesn't fit the Vegas 'profile' of hype, glitz, show & glitter. When I ask if I get my own drinks and the reply is, "Help yourself and feel like you're at home." that is the hospitality of a real Q place. Nothing fancy here. Paper towels on a roll (not even perforated) for napkins, plastic utensils, picnic tables ... and the food is for real. Ribs, brisket ... done like it should be with long cook times & plenty of smoke. Outlaw burger & BBQ meatloaf, excellent. Totally satisfying.
WOW! So Great. . My son and I went there for late lunch. I ordered the Biggie Dad, (brisket, pork, and hot link) on a bun with pickles, mac n cheese. My son got same. We really 3 enjoyed it. We back and order one to go, and the Guy ask me if I was local, said Yes! He ask me since I had on my Danica Patrick shirt if I like Nascar, said yes. He gave 4 free tickets to the truck race this weekend. How cool is that! A great place to return back too.
Amazing beef rib & baby back pork ribs!!! Super cute place & great prices...the outlaw burger was ok..not so great as i expected it to be..
Holy mother of God this place is fantastic. The moment I stepped in to this place from the smell alone I was expecting gold and I was not disappointed. I ordered the Outlaw Burger and is was huge, and delicious. The brisket was tender and smoky and the burger was moist and perfectly cooked. . . Others ordered the pork and I got a sample. It was melt in your mouth good, savory with just a little sweet. This is one of the best BBQ places I've ever been. If you're in Vegas, to hell with Gordon Ramsay, Wolfgang Puck, and those other celebrity chefs on the Strip, and get thee hence to Rollin Smoke.
Great hole in the wall find. I had the brisket sandwich and waffle fries and my sister had the trio combo with brisket, ribs and waffle fries.  Her brisket was the ticket! The couple next to us recommended Mac and Cheese and the catfish. Can't wait for the next visit.
This is one of my favorite little hidden secrets in Vegas!!  Great prices,  great good,  a gem in my book.  This was my 2nd time here and just as pleased as the first time.  I had the BBQ meatloaf last time,  which was amazing,  I would call it one of their signature dishes for sure.  The ribs are great,  the chicken was a little undercooked today but great flavor my friend said.  I got the catfish as the guy there told me it was the best in town,  and that it was,  big claim but he came through and delivered.  Light,  flaky,  crispy with a ton of flavor,  served with hush puppies,  I got the greens as a side and it came with cornbread and a drink for $10.99. You can't beat that!!!  It is on my foodie list and highly deserved!!
I don't know why it took me over a year to come back. Rollin Smoke deserves more of my visits.. . I brought a friend in today for dinner. It was her first time, so she spent a few minutes to look at the wall-sized menu. I also found myself staring and trying to decide what to get. I wasn't feeling up to tackling a big portion today, so I didn't get the outstanding Outlaw Burger again. Instead, I went with the Catfish Po Boy ($8.99) and a dessert of Country Berry Cobbler (free with purchase of sandwich and Yelp check-in).. . I spent some time nibbling on my friend's Dad's Favorite, which is actually a sandwich (and thus qualifies for the dessert, although we didn't know it at the time). The brisket, pork, and hot links were all pretty tasty, although my friend could have done without the hot links because she is even more heat-averse than I am. She definitely went for a soda refill at least once.. . My po boy took upwards of 10 minutes longer to come out, which I felt was a good sign. It was worth it for that catfish. It was quite moist and flaky, properly seasoned, and lightly crunchy on the outside. The catfish was definitely the star. No complaints about the spicy and tartar sauces, which I ended up spreading all over the sandwich. Lettuce was fine, lemon was helpful, and tomato brought a nice lightness. Only thing I would have liked is if the bread was buttered or something. The bread was merely toasted, and it actually looked a bit burnt, but thankfully had none of that off-putting flavor.. . The country berry cobbler actually came out at the same time as the po boy. Unfortunately, by the time I was ready for dessert, the whipped cream had died. I actually had the peach cobbler last time, and while I would probably take the peach if forced to choose one, the berry cobbler is also very good and has enough of a tartness to offset the sweetness. It was also still warm, since it was served in a foam bowl, but I'm thinking that it contributed to the downfall of the whipped cream. I'll have to remember to try to ask for a delayed dessert presentation if I do this again.. . I noticed that at least 3 tables had people doing the AYCE, and that made me wish that I hadn't had lunch today. I definitely want to try the all you can eat option some time. I enjoy that sort of thing, and I would finally be able to get my hands on all of their meats at once. Maybe I'll be ready to bump it up to 5 stars on that day, but until then, I still highly recommend Rollin Smoke Barbeque to all lovers of meat - and catfish.
Wow - simply the best meal I had in Vegas last week.   Much better than the very high priced restaurants on the strip.. . I had the baby back ribs, and a colleauge had the 4 meat plate with chicken, hot link, brisket and ribs.    My baby backs were better than any I have had - ever.   Great smoke flavor, tender, and simply delicious.    . . I'm looking forward to my next trip to Vegas and visit to Rollin Smoke.. . Wooooooo  Pig Sooooooie
I went to Vegas last weekend and we ate here for an early dinner on Saturday. We got there at 5:30pm and already there was about 10-15 people there. There was 6 people in our group. Everyone's food came out pretty fast but unfortunately they forgot to put in my order so my food came out last. Because of that, the manager (or I think it was the manager) brought me our a complimentary dessert which was awesome. As for the actual BBQ, it was pretty darn good! Can't beat it for the price too. I've had BBQ in Houston so it's not the same but as good as you can get for outside of Texas and especially in Vegas!
I had best, most tender ribs from this place! My family has been dying to go here but it's a little out of the way for locals, so we finally made our way here. The line took about 20 minutes and it was a little cramped inside, but there seemed to be enough seating. I got baby back ribs, mac & cheese, criss cross fries, and peach cobbler. The ribs are. so. good. Seriously. As well as everything else. Best BBQ I've had in a long time.
Came here with my boys the other day.  This is definitely a gem located in a hole in a wall in the middle of red light district.  We were a little skeptical at first but since the reviews were great, we decided to go inside and try it out.. . The place is not that big but it is full of people.  It smells great inside... something you would expect in a bbq joint.  You pick a table then go to the guy where you can place your order and pay.  They will then bring you your food.  Drinks and utensils are self served.  . . The menu is filled with great selection of yummy food. We ordered the following (our eyes were bigger than our stomach for sure):. . 1) The Pit Special (4 choices of meat + 3 sides) -  We picked the brisket, pulled pork, double on the spare ribs, corn nuggets, bacon potato salad & mac & cheese.  The brisket was disappointing coz it was dry. The pulled pork has great flavor. The ribs is perfect! I love love the ribs... glad we doubled up on this.  The corn nuggets and bacon potato salad are amazing!  The mac & cheese is ok, had better.. . 2) Meatloaf + corn bread for his side - my son loved this one. The meat taste great but the onion rings are overpowering for me (not a big fan of onions). Now the corn bread is to die for!  It's moist and totally delish... one of the best that I've had. . . 3) Chicken Wings (Buffalo) + Waffle Fries - my husband loved the hot sauce but he said the wings was alright (he had the hot sauce on the side). The waffle fries was not bad but it wasn't great either.. . 4) Banana Pudding - this was disappointing for me. It taste like it came out of a package. . . Overall, this place is definitely a keeper for us.  We are all looking forward on coming back to try the other food on their menu.  The price is not bad, food is great, ambiance is casual & food servings are good size.
