4 hr wait?!?  Hell no. Purchased the $20 express line only to be disappointed by the food sooner than later. Yes, the selection is quite expansive, but the quality and taste were subpar for Vegas standards. Dry meats, sushi with higher-than-normal rice ratios, and a Reno-esque seafood station...no thank you. However, the cheese and charcuterie section--props to that. I will not be back. Will be at Wicked Spoon or the Buffet at the Wynn instead.
Before going to Vegas, this buffet was recommended by so many of my friends. After looking at hundreds of reviews on Yelp,  I was convinced I needed to try this place out. . . They have this high tech way of putting your name on the list, but given all the hype, the wait was still insane!! 204 minute wait, according to my ticket! . . My family was hungry so we opted for the express line (extra $20/ per person). Seriously , if you have the money and don't want to wait, it's the way to go.. . Anyways, the food was very underwhelming. There was nothing at this buffet that stood out to me. They had a bunch of stations you could grab food at, but everything was just ehh.. . I was very disappointed and will not be coming back here. . . Try it if you must, but beware of long lines, outside and inside the buffet, not so great food, and a hole in your wallet from the cost.
This is probably the most overrated buffet in Vegas. I heard good things about this place when they first opened, but when I visited a week ago for dinner, it was overcrowded with very long lines on the meat and seafood stations. I had to wait more than 15 minutes on the seafood station line! And for what?! Crab legs that were overcooked and oysters that smelled like women's makeup! The meat station was little better but it did not make up for other shortcomings.
I have wanted to try this buffet for the LONGEST TIME!  It opened about 2 years, and I did not have the opportunity to go yet. My best friend was visiting and she also wanted to try it.  She did the 24 hour buffet and paid an additional $30 to go to this buffet. . . We went for Sunday brunch. The holiday pricing was $52.99 for brunch and about $64 for dinner. Ouch. There was a total reward discount, so we went off to get a card. They do have a new check in system where you enter your information, and they will text you within the time. We were told we would be seated within 2 hours and 30 min. After an hour they texted us, and we were to wait in line for about another 40 min. So, I guess the text is the estimated total wait time. . . The Sunday Brunch came with unlimited mimisas, and we both never tried it. So, we were like why not. The lines for seafood and meat were super long! There was a lobster benedict that tasted amazing! There was a cheese pizza with mushrooms and I believe it was riccota chese that was amazing! I also tried the lamb chops that were pretty tasty. Their Asian station was awesome! The pork shumai and everything tasted amazing.. . In order reviews, they had a souffle station, but when I went there, I only saw a crepe station and a shaved ice station at the dessert station. . . Now, why the three stars. The wait time for everything was horrendous. After waiting in that long line, we would still have to wait in long lines and wait. Plus, it was super expensive. It was good, but expensive!
Every time I come to sin city, I make it a point to eat here. It's not like THE best I've ever had (in Drake's voice) but I enjoy it. Fancy-ish buffet so it comes with a not so cheap price but they have an extensive plethora of food from different ethnicities so my palate is satisfied. My most recent visit here was back in June and I was actually pretty surprised how authentic their pho was when the hubby to be grabbed a bowl (since somebody was shit faceted the night before). It was tasty and my weird ass was eating my desserts whilst taking a spoonful of the broth each bite. I love the salty and sweet combo let's just say. I'll be back next time with my big appetite!
Meats were really dry.   Have had better Chinese food at subpar Chinese buffets.  Oysters were not high quality.   Neither was the rest of the food.   Highlights were meatballs, warm crab legs,  and deserts.   But not worth the four hour wait or $20 extra per person for express seating.   There are better buffets in Vegas by far.
Not impressed at all!  Mostly lunch items at breakfast time. Most of the breakfast items were cold and not very well prepared. . . Bellagio's buffet is MUCH better!
I've been here for the Champagne Brunch ($36+) and for Dinner ($50+). This place is okay, both times. Somewhere, people have claimed that this is the best buffet in town, but I've had better. There are lines everywhere. Average 45 minute plus wait for the line to get into the buffet and then there's the crab legs line, about 10-15 minutes long. . . Brunch: . I went to the Champagne Brunch this past Sunday. There were a few parts of the buffet that I liked, like that they had crab legs for lunch and the brisket and the service. I didn't get the crab legs though, because the line was too long. The red velvet pancakes are good only because they come in tiny portions, just enough for you to try, but they were hard and not at all tasty. Tried getting a lox bagel but the cream cheese was too hard for me to pull the knife out of so I ended up just getting the smoked salmon alone. The dim sum was okay and everything was mislabeled. New foodie adventurers would have been confused the whole time. . . Dinner:. FYI The last time I was at this buffet for dinner was a few months ago. It was a so-so dinner buffet. I had the crab legs which were good like any other crab leg buffet. Also had a cut of the prime rib and that was okay.. . Overall, nothing too memorable but the lines. Service was good. Food, okay.
To be fair, we didn't actually eat here....but that was the problem. We got there and got a ticket to come back in 2.5hrs. Frustrating, but we walked around and came back 2.5hrs later.....just to wait in line for another 45min to pay. Then we were lead to ANOTHER line to get seated. This line was huge. We waiting in that line for 10minutes without moving one step, and decided to give up and go elsewhere. Thankfully we just made up a story that we had a show to get to and they gave us a refund. I should also note that from the seating line you could see inside the buffet and there were even lines for the food. This experience would have taken up our entire day.
This place was so overrated. We went just for the experience because we were on vacation in Las Vegas. Compared to the other Las Vegas Buffets, this one is not worth waiting for and there are much better ones out there such as Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon. The wait when we got there to get our ticket was already overwhelming and that was just the beginning. The ticket for the approximate wait was 176 Minutes (3 Hours) but we waited anyways. FACT: You could pay $20 per person to cut to the front of the line. After that long 3- Hour wait, you need to wait once more but to pay for your meal for about an hour or two. It was very pricey ($300 for 4 People). After half a day's worth of waiting, my family and I were not even impressed. The food was typical Vegas food. Though I only give the overall food a 6/10, the dessert bar was what made it the real deal. I gave a 10/10 for the dessert's bar because of the variety and taste. TIP: Try the horchata (Mexican rice drink) in a bottle.
4.5 (-.5 on price) Really great buffet.  Dessert AMAZING... didn't include alcoholic drinks. But we did order sangria..yes delic. Ok for the experience but a bit to pricey for me. def a one time thing bc it's over $50 per person  yikes! ..love the crab legs steamed and cold..yum with melted butter.  love the cake pops..mm good! Bit nice and classy. Great friendly staff n server.
Great experience here. My boyfriend and I came to this buffet on the last day of our little Vegas trip. A lady named Valerie was at the register, she was a pleasure. She was very sweet, talking to us and asking us questions - making us feel very welcomed. The host who seated us was also very welcoming. . . The food was great. There were an overwhelming amount of options but everything we tried was good. Don't skip out on the taco station, it was really good. The cooks will make you fresh tacos right there and then you add whichever salsas/toppings are preferred. We didn't save room for dessert, so I can't comment on that. But all the savory food was great. . . The buffet entrance is right next to the entrance for the pool so we stumbled out there after our meal and took a little food-coma nap by the pools. Totally recommended.
I came to this place for dinner buffet over labor day weekend wtih my family and everything was delicious!  I had been to other buffets in Vegas but it was my first time here.  The others I had been to were okay, nothing amazing, but I will definitely say that this one is now at the top of my list.  . . Surprisingly, we arrived at 7pm on a Friday (of a holiday weekend) and only had to wait 25-30 minutes to get seated.  That was awesome because I was STARVING.  Upon walking inside, I was already overwhelmed by all the different food options.  I ended up trying as much as I could and honestly liked pretty much everything I tried.  They have a huge range of things to choose from- soups, sushi, tacos, oysters, crab legs, fish, meats, etc.  I personally tried a few of the chef special hot dishes and liked them a lot (although I don't know what they actually were).  The ox tail soup they had was also perfection, along with the mushroom truffle soup.  Aside from the main options, they also had a humongous assortment of dessert- macarons, cakes, pastries, crepes made to order, and gelato!  I ended up sharing with my brother and essentially trying a bite of everything.  I'd definitely recommend doing this if you have expand your stomach enough to do so ;).. . In the end, I walked away feeling super full and regretting my life decisions (like eating that last mousse, or going to buffets in general)... but after recovering from that, I'd definitely go again because I just can't pass up all the deliciousness that is there :P.  This is most definitely my favorite buffet on the strip.
Service - very good.  If you use your card to get the small discount, they get your name off of it and will call you by it. . Setting/layout - poor.  Being by the pool, it is a nice view, but the cloth on the chairs showing so much dirt and the chips on the bowls and plates, it gave me the feeling that it has been around forever and is ready for a remodel (I think it has been about 1 year since this place opened?). . Food -  poor.  There really wasn't much that was memorable, and more that is done just as well in places that charge half the price.  The only things that they severed  that I would even think of ordering at a restaurant were the mushroom & truffle soup and the red velvet whoopie pie. . All things considered, I would much rather go to the Bellagio Buffet, save the $20/person and get better food
Was so exited to come here for dinner, but after eating the food I must say it was overly hyped and not worth it! The food was either way too salty or over cooked, even the dessert was not that good. I won't be coming back here again.
I have to say that I was disappointed with this buffet.  This was my first time and I had heard many good things, but sadly I won't be going back.  . . The good: . - we went early for dinner @ 6pm so there was no wait to get in and no long lines (when we left @ 8 pm there was a decent line);. - the ambiance was nice, good floor layout for tables and easy access to the food lines;. - bottled juices - i think fresh squeezed/juiced and very tasty (my fave was guava, also had strawberry, pineapple, and two or three others) . - goodvariety of food to choose from, excellent carved meet selection (prime rib, rack of lamb, two types of sausage) and great seafood selections (oysters on the half shell, cold snow crab, crab claws and hot king crab), standard asian food fair, srandard pizza selection and small pasta area combined with the chef specials.. - cute finger pot holders given, but sadly there were no hot plates to use them on (all plates were cool to touch for me). . The not-so-great:  . - the price @ 100 for two for dinner is steep (this is the price on a Thursday nite, Friday and Saturday the price increases $3 per person);. - while there was a lot of food to choose from the quality/taste of the food was just so-so: my wagyu burger was not warm from sitting on the line and the top burger was hard and crunchy; the dim sum was rubbery both the skins of the shrimp dumpling and the hard skin of the custard bow I had; some flavors were bland or needed more seasoning; I expected stellar food for the price and it wasn't there;. - although we went early to beat the crowds it felt like most of the food had been sitting for awhile (most plates dishes were barely warm) with exception of the seafood;. - the hot king crab was hidden in the chef special section and you had to know about and ask for it. - no explanation on the chef specials (3 small plates but were all labeled chef special and no one around to explain what it was). - staff service was pleasant but slow (slow to get our drink order and slow to clear our plates). - the kicker for me was towards the middle of our meal a staff was clearing the table next to us and tipped over a bowl on the way to his platter of dirty dishes pile with something that had liquid and rice in it....  the angle of the tip sprayed the rice and liquid in my direction (you could see the rice trajectory on the ground in a triangle shape - yes it was that big).  it hit the arm of my chair, my cheek (this is how I was alerted of the spill) and some landed on the corner of my table.  yuck.  when I turned to see where this had come from, the staff just said "sorry" and continued his cleaning of the table.  it was another 5 to 10 minutes before a different staff person came by to sweep the rice on the ground.
One of the best dinner buffets we have had! Fresh quality and a lot of different variety of food! Yum! Def going back when we go to Vegas!
We came here during the Labor Day weekend. Boy, the wait was LONG! We waited over 2 hours to get in. The food selection was great! There are a lot of choices and numerous stations. The seafood such as crab legs, oysters, crab claws, shrimp cocktails, and crawfish were fresh. We also tried their oxtail soup. It was pretty good. The dessert station was great as well. They have all kinds of cakes and pastries, gelato, mochi ice-cream, chocolate covered strawberries, as well as crepes. Overall, the food and services were great. It's the long wait that makes us rethink whether to come back again. That's the only reason for knocking off the one star from my review.
I enjoy food but my taste runs a bit all over the map from a hole in the wall to 5 star.  The buffet delivers all my wants and needs in one place and it's a buffet.  While the crowds can get heavy on the weekend it's still kinda of worth it and much better than Wicked Spoon. . Juice bar, chicken and waffles, pho, dim sum, sliders, stone crab , desserts and more.
This buffet was the one of two buffets I had on my must go to list while I visited Vegas (other being Wicked Spoon). We ended up going around 1pm which made the price for each person $35.99.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The waitress called me by name (since I paid) for the entire meal and even asked my friend her name.. . There are seven different sections including seafood, sushi, breads, cheeses, tacos, meats and even fresh juices. They also have a separate bar for desserts including gelato. The food was delicious. The standout for me was the sweet potato tots. The desserts were so amazing and were my favorite part as I am a sugar lover. I would recommend this buffet, especially if you can make an earlier time so it will be the lowest cost. The price was the only downfall for me, besides the bathroom being up the entrance making you walk all the way out of the buffet to use it.
A large selection of food from all over the world. Great atmosphere and ambiance.  Quality of food is on par with a 5 star hotel. But did not have lobster and king crab that I was expecting for this kind of price.
2.5 Stars. . Although they claim 500 items on the buffet most of it is crap.  The best thing in there was the smoked turkey breast.  I found the other meats fatty and no flavor.  The crab legs were okay, the are in pots and you haveto ask for them.  The pizza and the meatballs were not good.. . The oysters are opened but not cleaned or loosened up so the slide out, living in LA they do not seem that fresh either.. . For over $50 it is just not worth it, it is just as good as Golden Corral. . . We would not return.
I really love the selections they have here. the meats and seafood section is great and i like how you can get hot/cold crab legs. One of my fav buffets here in vegas.
I had read other reviews rating this buffet as over-hyped, and from my experience, those reviews seem to be pretty true. I went there with my family on Thursday evening for dinner and the wait was about 30 minutes long. I was eagerly looking forward for their seafood and steak offerings, but it was quiet disappointing to see that the options were quiet limited. For the seafood options, they had about 5 cold-seafood choices including cold crabs legs and cocktail shrimps, and for the "so called steak items" they only had briskets and prime rib. Whereas when i had called them earlier that day to inquire about their dinner speicals, the phone operator had clearly mentioned to me that the dinner menu will include lobster tails and at least NY strip steak. I paid about $230 for 4 people and had read those "best buffet in LV" reviews, so may be my expectation was a bit higher - but Bacchanal Buffet definitely did not meet what I had expected given my positive experince with Bellagio's The Buffet and Cosmo's Wicked Spoon. . About the foods, they have a small Chinese section with horrible dim-sum options. Then they have some cold cuts section followed by Italian (with steamed crab legs that were surprisingly good), Mexican station, American section including beef cuts, sliders n fried chicken, and the small seafood section. The dessert section is in the middle of the dining area but it was way better than the dinner items. . In short, I wont be coming back to this buffet in the future, but my three stars goes to their dessert section, wagyu sliders, fried chicken with waffle, beef tacos, and may be couple of more other items. . My recommendation - if u are really seeking for a "good tasting food" in contrast to varieties of options, this is not the place for you. They are over priced than any other buffets, and is not worth the wait and money. I would rather get those $50, 24-hours acess buffets for all of my three meals all day long, or would rather look into some good eats in Thai and Malaysian options in the city. Bacchanal was a disappointment.
Bacchanal buffet is a relatively new buffet in Las Vegas located in Caesars Palace. It's definitely on the pricey side, about $58 per person.  The wait can be long if it's a busy day. If you're super hungry and want to eat right away, there's an extra $20 charge.  I wasn't lying when I said pricey!. . This buffet is nicely decorated and they even offer taking your picture while waiting in line. . Let's first start off with how HUGE this place is. In the back is the Asian foods, then there's salads, Mexican food, American food, and sea food. The seafood line gets long as they have crab legs and oysters. They also have steamed crab legs near the salad.  . . Dessert area is good too!  I had the shaved ice and tried macaroons. The first time I was here, they had bomb pistachio macaroons. Recently, I got green macaroons thinking they were pistachio, but they were green tea!  Disappointing!  I guess they switch it up. Oh, the horchata is good!!. . Buffets for me are kinda a waste of money because I can't eat a lot in one sitting. Bacchanal buffet is a good place to try out but it's a bit pricey for me to eat here often. Give it a try if you can. . . Ps, if you or someone in your party are a total rewards diamond or platinum member, you can bypass the line!. . Minus 1 star for the rude worker!  He was directing people to go in the right line. My husband is a diamond member. We paid and proceeded to the diamond line to get seated. This RUDE worker rushed to us said wait wait go in this line (regular line).  He didn't even ask "excuse me, are you diamond."  It was just an assumption we were idiots and can't read the signs. He didn't even apologize. I tried to look for him later to get his name, but darn I didn't.
Amazingggggggg. Pricey, it was $59.99 for dinner but if you have your M Life card it's $49.99. The food was great, the meats were amazing, prime rib, brisket and even the lamb chops, YUM!. . The seafood was decent, some of the oysters were a bit sandy.
WAIT, PRICE, AND SEATING . first off.... a 218 minute wait? ridiculous. however, they let you check in ahead of time and will contact you when you are coming up next. so, you're free to wander around as long as you make it back on time. however, this long wait was almost entirely attributed to the fact that it was labor day weekend, and it was early dinner. our bill came out to over $800, but we did have a party of 11, so it turned out to be over $70 a person - a bit steep, but if you take in the fact that they're a new-ish buffet, it's dinner time, and it's a holiday weekend, it seems somewhat reasonable. . . as soon as it's your time to enter, you are handed a branded rubber contraption that helps you grab hot plates without being burned. then, you are swooped away to your table. we had a group of 11, so we had a semi-private glass walled room that was sort of away from the main dining area. everything was neat, pretty, and perfect. the dining room doesn't look big, but then you notice the back rooms and you're just pretty blown away by just how big this place is.  . . . SERVICE . the service was amazing. everyone who worked there was courteous, kind, respectful, and non-judgemental. they made everyone feel very welcome and seemed overall happy to help you. we had someone come to our table about every 15 minutes to take plates away, bring beverages, and to ask if we needed anything. although coming around every 15 minutes sounds excessive, they made it happen in a way that wasn't annoying or seemed like they were trying to push us out. . . FOOD. there's a HUGE selection. some things that stand out are the fresh juices in the glass bottles (strawberry, agua de pina, jamaica, horchata, strawberry juice, etc), a taco station, a noodle station, and a custom shaved ice station in the dessert area. . . i tried the things that many people suggested - their prime rib, macarons, chicken and waffles baskets, their fresh juices, and their watermelon/feta salad. . . prime rib - great salty/savory flavor around the edges, tender on the inside. kind of flavorless towards the middle, but that may have been my fault, as i forgot to get a side of au jus. . . fresh juices are delicious. horchata's not as sweet as i'm accustomed to, but you know it's fresh. very light. a bit thick, as they grind up the rice and don't strain it as many times to get all the rice grains out. the agua de pina is not so sweet, either. in fact, everything's a bit light. the mango one tastes like a mango snapple. i loved the strawberry one - i added it to the lemonade i ordered to make a strawberry lemonade! very yummy. . . chicken and waffle baskets - chicken was breaded wonderfully. even though it took me about 15 minutes to get to and was not as hot as when i got it off the burner, it was still crunchy. breading was insanely tasty, and chicken was very moist. the waffle, however, wasn't as great. it was mealy and had very little taste; very dry. abandoned that after the first bite.. . the watermelon and feta was great. very refreshing and rich at the same time - a perfect combination. they added a vinaigrette that complimented it perfectly. . . macarons are yummy. perfectly crisp, soft towards the middle, impeccable feet. i tried the green tea ones, which were a bit sweet, and grabbed some sesame ones thinking they were salted caramel. . . their cold crab legs are extremely salty, and can only be had after an enormously long wait in line. because i didn't want to be rude, i waited in the atrociously long line just for the shrimp, which was right before the crab legs. next time, i may just ask the people around the shrimp if i can just nip in and grab a few pieces instead of waiting 20-30 minutes for the shrimp that obviously no one else in line was waiting for. (TIP!!! : if you're looking for warm crab legs, go to the asian station, where there is  little to no wait !! many people stood in line only to get to the front of it and were disappointed that it wasn't what they were looking for.) anyway, the shrimp cocktail sauce was delicious, but a little sharp - a little too much horseradish, but still tasty. the shrimp's a little brown. . . their lobster chowder is a must try, as is their pasta. . . dessert is great, as well! just be wary if you have any allergies, as they don't properly label a lot of things in the dessert section. i bit into a beignet only to find it was raspberry jam filled, and into a cake that had something i was allergic to. so, be wary. . . only gripe were the other patrons. they're rude and cut in line unapolegetically. however, food's great and these unsavory people will not stop me from coming back whenever i'm in town again.
This buffet is very good, however, I don't think it warrants it as being #1 on so many Vegas Buffet lists.  It is just as good as the other top tier Vegas Buffets. It's a toss up.   After I've tried everything, the main things I gravitate back to are the ribs, oysters, salmon sashimi, and the creme brulee.
You will pay more for admission to the baccanal than it takes to fill up your car's tank. You will wait an hour to get in line and then another half an hour when in line waiting to be seated. It is worth it!. . All I can say is that I ate my weight in steamed crab legs and then got up and asked for more! Best crab on the strip; the rest of the food was awesome, too. The only part I didn't enjoy so much was dessert, but I'm not sure if that's because I was feeling pretty miserable after eating too much or if the sweets were legitimately not as good as everything else.  . . I tried everything except most of the sides- I was a woman on a mission and had no room for fillers, aka, veggies. I don't remember it being very vegetarian friendly, either. I mean, there are vegetarian options, but nothing nearly as appealing as everything else. . . If you're like me and seek out buffets for the crab, this is your place. I ate at 2 other buffets offering crab legs in the same week and nothing compared to the baccanal!
Bacchanal has a lot of food options but there weren't really any dishes that stood out to me. So, if you prefer quantity over quality, then this is the perfect place for you. . . I appreciate the check in process, where you first check in at a kiosk. They print out a receipt with an estimated wait time and text you when it's time to go back to pay and get in line to be seated. Beats having to stay in line the whole time! You can walk around the Forum Shops while you wait.. . I have been to Bacchanal two times this year and I think that's more than enough for me. I'd rather go back to The Wicked Spoon!
Great food n desserts! Although sushi are not very good. Macaroons are very delicious.
Lots of choices. Enjoyed the crepe made in front of me. The roasted tomatoes and roasted mushrooms were especially good. We came for breakfast and will be full until supper. We will be back.
Best part of this buffet were the desserts, mainly the cookies and the oreo souffle!  Watermelon juice was refreshing.  Everything else was overly salty, like the king crab legs, extremely peppery or bland.  Do NOT try their pad thai!  It was so peppery!  Chicken and waffles lacked flavor.  Sweet potato tater tots were decent.. . If you're going to spend $50, just go to the buffet in the Wynn or Wicked Spoon.
We went here on a Friday afternoon around 1pm.  The line up was minimal. . This buffet is overly hyped.  They give you these plastic dish holders so you can grab a clean hot dish and be okay. Very ingenious.  Though we never used them. But I can imagine it can come in handy once in awhile.. . The food was ok, above average for a buffet.  Lots of variety.  Good service. . I think it's slightly over priced for a buffet but will probably eat there again and try the dinner menu. . . It's one of those places that had good marketing and "had to" try at least once.
For being $52.99 a person and surrounded with hype, I came in on a Friday night expecting a great buffet. I left very disappointed. Many items seen on yelp were not available. I'm guessing they've cut back on their offerings.. . The prime rib lacked flavor. Everything else tasted average in comparison to cheaper buffets nearby. Mochi ice cream wasn't on display (????) they only gave them out upon request, and when I finally got it... They were pretty much melting and falling apart. . . They have crab legs, yes, but so does a $35 buffet. The seafood selection was pretty limited.. . The lamb chops and the sliders were really good, but I fail to see why this place carries so much hype with a high price tag. I really wanted to love this place, but in the end, it is just another "average good" buffet that appears fancy. . . I might give it a second chance, but I won't be looking forward to it.
One of the best meals and buffets I have ever had in Las Vegas!! . . We came here for a Monday Brunch and had an incredible meal. As a local, I usually try to steer clear of buffets but after a little stay-cation at the Paris I got on yelp and decided why not. Everything we had was so incredibly delicious. Usually at buffets, you get overwhelmed with so many choices and then underwhelmed with lack of flavors. This was not the case with Bacchanal. We took our time and tried as many things as we could and were incredibly happy with each choice. The po-boy slider, the chicken and waffle, the sushi, the donuts, the red velvet pancakes, the slider, the fresh sushi, the mushroom grits, the lobster biscuit and gravy, the crepes, the cheese spread, the dessert spread- we enjoyed it all. Every item we tasted had its own unique flavors full of real quality ingredients. We were incredibly happy with all the items we tried and loved the different "chef specials" that were created so we could try things not usually on the buffet menu. The service was great and we left happy and desiring our sweat pants. Just the way you are supposed to feel after eating at a buffet. =)  I will definitely be recommended this buffet to my local friend and out of town visitors.
A friend heard this was one of the best buffets in Vegas. Definitely one of the newer ones. I was disappointed from how my friend hyped it up. The venue was nicely decorated and has a lot of options. However, the food wasn't that great.  The hot and sour soup tasted like a bowl of soy sauce. The brisket tasted like charcoal. They didn't have sashimi but did some sushi and rows. The fried chicken batter sucked, and that's supposed to be the best part of fried chicken.  Cevichi wasn't bad. The prime rib blew.  From this, I didn't even bother with the desert. Desert looked pretty so I didn't want to ruin that image with how bad it might taste. Definitely had better and not coming back.
For 50 dollars a person i definitely think it's worth the money if you know what to get. Me and my girlfriend went and filled our table with endless plates with all different types of foods. The wait wasn't as long as we thought it would be. Over all a great experience and delicious food.
Pros: atmosphere and appearance, accepts credit, dessert customizability (shaved ice, and ice cream selections),. Cons: food looks better than tastes, hard to get waiter's attention, $$$$. . The Bacchanal is very expensive. I think it was $50/person when my family and I went for dinner. You would think that for that price, the food would be delicious and the experience would be amazing. I won't say it was completely bad, but it definitely wasn't worth $50. My family and I had to wait maybe 10 minutes after paying to be seated. I didn't like how low the salads were. It was a little inconvenient to get salads because of all the physical barriers that I had to overcome (ie position on low counters, and far from edge, window guards make it hard to reach in). I really only enjoyed the chicken and waffles, the salads, and the ice cream/sorbets. Though there were tons of things to choose from, and after sampling everything, I can live without most and that's why in the end, I felt that $50 was way too much. It is a little lower on my scale of Vegas buffets, just below the Wicked Spoon.
Lava Cake, Lava Caka, La-va Cake.... . This isn't the real Caesar's Palace, but Bacchanal is a real buffet. After a more than modest face-lift, this grand buffet has talk of being at the apex of Vegas buffets. You spend Friday, Saturday night, glowing in a whirlpool of stupendous hedonism, soon to arrive at the calm of the storm and experiencing  Bacchanal is a perfect filling station to rejuvenate for the long ride home. Expect to attain a fast pass and wait 2 hours, ideal for gambling time and to ride up that appetite. Look for long lines of hanging tongue awaiting an array of Crab Legs, ideal protein cuts like Prime Rib and Lamb Shanks, and then petite yet prominent desserts as Gold-flaked Tiramisu and the heavenly Lava Cake. And if you leave a tip, the cute waitress will rub your tummy to ease sudden pregnancy of top-notch gluttony.
This place was supposed to be the new Wicked Spoon (better! cleaner! newer!). It was good but I wasn't really blown away or anything. I came on a Monday and luckily only had to wait 10 min (I think my review would have been less stars if I had to wait over an hour for this). . . Pros:. -Really new and the layout (esp if you're seated near the front) makes you think "Oh shit there's MORE??". So I guess if you're into that.. -Food is good overall, really good selection. . Cons:. -None--expect maybe the wait if you do have to wait a long time for this. . . Like I said, this buffet is good but it wasn't OMGAH amazing. . . Although...I DID notice they had a shave ice stand near the dessert and that made me super happy because I've never seen that at a buffet and it was good. But....you know, it's ice and condensed milk so you really can't go wrong with it.
Best buffet ever!  Hate buffets, until this one!  So good,  worth every penny,  tons of selection,  food was fresh and hot which is hard at a buffet. Desserts are my fave,  no words to describe how pleased I was with this buffet! Amazing!
Not a fan of these buffets, it's just mediocre food to me, mostly junk filler.  I come here for the crab legs and prime rib, they were excellent.  Crab legs were good mixture of snow crab and king crab.
2nd time here but I think I won't be back unless I have to...the wait time is scary.. We had been waiting for 3 hours to get in even though we did get the number ticket.. We got the ticket at 5:50 pm and they texted me to come back around 7:10 pm and I thought the wait time is not bad but right after I came back I had been waiting for 1 & 1/2 hours to pay and another 30 minutes to be seated.. In the end I started eating my dinner at 9 pm.. After 3 hours wait I duet feel hungry anymore so I paid $65 (including tips) per person without eating a lot!! Not worth it!!!
Pricey and nothing special. I mean it is a buffet so I wasn't expecting a magical experience but warm food would be a plus. Some dishes were nearly room temperature. I will say the staff was very friendly and attentive.
Awesome buffet!!!! Caesar's buffet is by far the best in Vegas. Come early if you don't want to stand in line forever. A little on the pricier side but well worth the money.
Good selection of items. They Have A Minimum of 300 Items at any given time. You might not get to try all the items haha...it's definitely worth the visit.. The CUCUMBER juice is must try but it is only available till 11 am. If you got sweet tooth, save space for dessert ;)
Not worth the money. The buffet set up was not good. We only thought the was two station. Surprise the sushi, asian, fruit and salad station was hidden. You have to walkaround the corner to see it. The dessert was the best. Seafood was not up to par on seafood. Crab leg was not good. Oyster was great. We were not in the mood to eat the hidden station after the disappointment of the lack on seafood selection.. Waitress should have told us since it was our first time here. . Save ur money and eat at the Rio. Better buffet. Bigger and better seafood selection.
I must say, this time around was way better than the first time I came in April 2013. Its $50/person on a weekday dinner.  Thank goodness we didn't have to wait in line too long!. . MY FAVORITES:. -the raw oysters: juicy and flavorful! I expected them to taste plain but they had their distinct oyster taste. The bad part about it is that they always run out, so you have to wait until they shuck more oysters and there's always a line.. -snow crab legs: always good and taste even better with the hot butter. Most people miss the butter because they didn't know it is in what appears to be a glass beverage jug. A girl even asked me, "What is that?" Clearly, it is hot, melted butter!. -clams, mussels, scallops: the clams were cooked in a really creamy sauce and it was delicious. The mussels were simmered in white wine and tomatoes, but the meat was a bit small. The scallops were still in their shells with spinach, sauce, and bread crumbs (reminded me of an Oyster Rockefeller).. -fresh juices: near the Mexican station they have jars full of different juices. The guava and Jamaican tea were good! . -desserts:  the mango gelato was my favorite! The lava cake was moist too.. . They have a very long buffet- seafood, American, soups, Mexican, Italian, Greek, Japanese, Thai, Chinese, desserts. The prime rib was dry and the soups were okay. I'm a soup fan but the chicken noodle soup and the tomato bisque were mediocre. They have a ramen, pho, and udon station too! Three different noodles, three different broths. The ramen noodles were too undercooked and had that flour taste. The pho was better but the broth was super salty. My BF said the sushi was good though. I was amazed at the Chinese station because they had porridge with lots of condiments and ginseng soup! The desserts were so-so. I took a bite of everything and just left it. . . Overall, it was okay. I didn't think it was worth $50/person. The only station worth eating here is the seafood station. Our neighboring tables expected the food to taste better too! One table even asked to speak to the manager and head chef to complain about quality and taste...
Throughout the Vegas trip we kept hearing about the... . "..#1 BUFFET IN VEGAS..". . ..."#1 BUFFET IN THE NATION.". . . I just had to see if this #1 thing was the real deal. Each person was about $50...there was an extremely large line. If you wanted to go in faster you could pay more $$. . [Location]. Inside Caesar's palace. Very large areas to sit inside. Fancy BUT COMFORTABLE CHAIRS. . . - - - Selections- - - . . Obviously you develop a plan. Seafood, expensive food, uncommon pricey food, high-end version favorites, and comfort foods.. . [Asian section] (So much variety: Chinese- Dim Sum, Vietnamese-Pho, Indonesian, Thai, Indian, Japanese- sushi pretty good)= 4 out of 5. . [Mexican section] Didn't try. Looked good. . [American/Meats]- Hit or miss with some, Mac and cheese was light but creamy. . [Pizza] SO GOOD. SAUCE IS LITTLE SWEET.. . [Seafood] Heard crab legs were ok-good. I tried the salmon and that was delicious. Lobster corn chowder was nice but kinda salty.. . [Veggies/Fruit] Pretty small, less veggies but more fruit (fresh). . [Dessert] Impressive: icecream, cookies, freshly made crepes. .  ----------. . Overall: Filled me up, seemed like some items were lacking in something, worth the trip and experience.
Features:. -This buffet is located in Ceasar's Palace.  When we came, the line was streaming long.  Luckily, we had a card that allowed us to walk straight in.. -The inside is huge!  Lots of tables and extremely spacious.  . -Depending on what you try, I would recommend to consume the seafood (especially crab legs), sushi, Chinese dishes, udon, and ramen.  Those were especially delicious for me.  . -The dessert bar had a lot of sweets from shave ice to cookies and cakes.  . -Champagne and mimosas are free! Drink up!. . Improvements:. -They could definitely improve on the pho (taste), dim sum (har gou was cold and hard to chew), and fruits (did not seem as fresh).. -Service was a little slow.  I asked for ice twice and finally got it almost ten minutes later.. . Tips:. -To avoid long lines, come early or go with someone who has the Diamond Card.. -They had carrot, orange, apple juice, and almond milk in cute little jars.
Really tasty but wasn't blown away.... . So I have been dreaming of coming to this buffet for years but my friends and family never wanted to wait in the 2 hour line.. . I was in Vegas on business by myself and a table for one was only a 30 min wait. I approached paid the $58.00 and waited with deep anticipation.. . So the waitress explained to me that I was in for a treat and not to eat the bread because there is so much to try.. . I started with a little of everything from the world of China, Italy, Mexican, Meats and seafood.. . I was super impressed with the set up and variety of all the foods as well as the quality.. The only thing for me is this two be world renowned and so expensive I was expecting things I have never seen or tasted before.. . I'm a certified (by my family) Crab leg queen!! I will devour the legs so quick you would think I had build in claws and butter and lemon in my veins.. . So excited that they had Hot crab legs, I hate cold crab legs! They were sweet and good but for the price I would have preferred to not have them pre cut. Anytime you expose the crab meat to boiling water outside of the shell it will loose some of its flavor. If you are ever in Honolulu the Pacific Ocean hotel has THE BEST CRAB LEGS YOU WILL EVER HAVE! NOT PRE CUT JUST PURE MASSIVE SWEET GOODNESS!!! And not to mention that buffet is only $35.00.. . I also loved the truffle and goad cheese pizza and the scallops Rockefeller.. . Much like the rest of the yelpers the dessert area seems so great but really the options aren't that diverse. No Key lime pie, no cobblers, no candied walnuts etc. I was your basic chocolate lovers dream, lava cake, carrot cake, cup cakes and crepes. I didn't finish any of my dessert it wasn't worth the calories.. . My favorite part hands down about the whole buffet is the fresh Aqua Frescas in little personal glass bottles. Things like that make you feel like you are paying for something different.. . Food was good but for the price and the normal wait time I wont be back..
Pros: . Huge selections. . Dessert was my favorite of all. . Servers were amazing.. . . Cons:. Long line.. . One bad thing on that day was a group of teenagers next to us of about 10 of them were so loud, obnoxious and they thought they were being funny at all.  Yes, you can have a good time but at the right place. This buffet is for family, couple, or for everyone who wants to savor the food selection and not feeling being on a frat house. They were lucky my stomach was bothering me at that time and don't feel like to confront them. Fortunately, the manager came over to them and explained to them to lower down their voices but that was after 2.5 hours. Heck, it wasn't a victory for all of the diners at that time.
The price that people pay for dinner at a buffet is not worth it for me.   But for brunch, OK, I'm game.   Went here for brunch, I love their wide selection.   Not offering what's in your typical buffet, like many items had lobster in it!   SCORE!!!   They have bottomless mimosas, I'm pretty sure you'll end up with a hangover because it's probably cheap champagne.. . But like most buffets, many foods look appetizing but it's not mind blowing.   I did enjoy their meats, soups, and deserts selections.   Woohoo, gelato in the house!   When it's hot outside, you can take a cone of gelato and bring it out.   . . I must say that out of all buffets, this is one that I enjoyed most because my friends and I were able to select different things we've never had before and share because in the end, it was something that didn't taste as good as it reads or looks and we don't want to waste food.   . . They did have a lot of things that I did enjoy trying though.   This is a must try buffet for everyone who comes to Vegas.
Hands down the best buffet ever! What more can I say? The service was excellent and the food was beyond amazing!
It's a great buffet, don't get me wrong, but it's just overhyped. The Prime rib was great, and the seafood selection was great, but all the other food was just meh. It's a great buffet overall, but not worth the ridiculous price. For the money you could eat at a really good restaurant and order as much as you want, and the food quality would be better.
Came here for brunch and it was worth it. Talk about never ending food! This place is by far the LARGEST buffet I have ever been to. Maybe I shouldn't eat for 48 hours before hitting this place up. . Breakfast was good! The Benedict's were delicious and man, that lobster Benedict is a MUST EAT. They have fresh squeezed juices and a ton of pastries to choose from. . Their "Asian section" wasn't too impressive... The Pad Thai was very dry and the noodles were crunchy as hell. I took one bite and didn't finish the rest. The dim sum wasn't great either, pork bun was yummy though!
This is hands down the best buffet in Las Vegas. I've eaten at some of the best, including Bellagio buffeting Wynn buffet, and dabbled in some less expensive ones such as the Planet Hollywood and M buffets, and this is by far the BEST. The food selection is great, as the buffet offers you the range of different cuisines you would expect from a top notch world class buffet. What separates this place from the rest is the quality. The beef brisket was one of the best I've EVER had, including those at buffet joints in the south. The curries are fresh and taste straight out of Thailand. The Italian meatballs are very well made and authentic, rivaling even those of Rao's next door.  For those of you who only come to buffets to eat seafood...this might not be the place for you. The seafood is good but similar to Wynn and Bellagio. For those of you who come for a top notch culinary experience normally not offered in the mass produced mass consumed aisles of the buffet--this is definitely the place to go!
Eating here was a much better experience than your standard all you can eat buffet. It is far more classy and elegant than the typical Vegas buffet.  They had a pretty large selection of foods. Mostly everything I had was good, but nothing in particular blew me away. The display of the food was magnificent. They made each item feel like you were taking something special.  The carving station had the largest selection of meet I have ever seen served in one place. Dessert items were cute and delicious. I would love to come back one day.
Don't believe the hype. I think this place is overrated, overpriced, and not worth the money. Two people would roughly cost almost $80. The selection here is no where near wicked spoon. Go elsewhere like to the cosmopolitan. I would even rank some other buffets way better than this one off the strip.
There was a very large selection of different foods. Went there for brunch. The Asian food was surprisingly very delicious. The line to get in was ridiculous. My favorite was the dim sum. But overall, a good variety of foods for all types of moods.
Decided to try Giada's new restaurant at the Cromwell for Sunday brunch, heard such good things about it we had to give it a try. We get there and the wait is about 2 hours away! Well next time we will not go on a weekend and will call for a reservation first. So what is our next choice? Well, Ceasar's Palace is just across the street for the highly touted Baccanal buffet. We get to the entrance and what do we see? some kind of "fast pass" system like they have at Disneyland, the machine says to register for a line ticket and wait time it between 58 to 68 minutes. Really?! they have it at such an exact science that they know it will be 58 minutes? not 47 or 61 minutes? oh wait, if you don't want to wait with the masses they will let each person in for $20 more! What a deal huh?. What is the strategy here? we can't let you in right now or even let you try your luck and wait in line....hey! what shoulld you do with a hour to kill inside a casino? gamble maybe?. So at the Baccanal buffet you can't even wait in line to see if maybe by some kind of miracle you get in within 1/2 hour or ? Overall, diners beware you can't just walk in, you are put into a take a number system, unless you want to pay the toll to get in now.
For $48 you get a brunch buffet.  You check in at the computer station and wait for the text message.  The wait today was supposedly one hour at noon but it was only a 20 minute wait for a group of 6.  What was worthy of filling up the tummy? Udon (add whatever you want that you can find ex. onions), prime rib, boiled crab legs, green tea brulee and bread pudding.  Don't get me wrong, everything was good quality! However, you enjoy the food more when you haven't wasted stomach space with other essentials.
Today we had a good friend come into town and she wanted to try a "good" buffet.  Hearing all the hype and doing research of the city, we decided to try the Bacchanal Buffet. From the start, we knew it was going to be pricey coming in a little over $50 bucks a person.$175 for 3 people with tax.. Ugh. Having never been,  we wanted try it. Initially entering the buffet it looked great, there was plenty of food, no real wait for anything you wanted. Unlike a traditional Buffets where the food is placed in metal pans and set on a steam table to keep it hot, this one was a bit different. Most of the food was placed in nice ceramic pots, sitting on a granite countertop for the guests to take from. The problem was I immediately seen is that the food was never that hot. By the time I dished something onto my plate and walked to my table it was almost cold.  The meat section had plenty of meat selections to choose from, being a baby back rib lover, I tried the pork ribs twice and both times they were pretty fatty. It was a bummer.. My wife said the crab legs were just ok, not great. The best part we all thought is the buffets dessert section, where we filled up on gorgeous looking sweets that did taste as good as they looked. Overall I can now say I have now tried the "Top Buffett" in town, however I don't think I would ever go back. For the price I expected better quality of the food. I have been much happier at a smaller off strip buffet for a fraction of the cost.  Conclusion, was is bad? No, Was it worth the $$? Definitely not, Was it an experience, Yes.
We dropped by here for a late Sundaylunch. First of all, endless mimosas?? Sweeeeet. My friend downed 8 of those, so I'm pretty sure that alone made up for the buffet price haha. Heavy drinker, woot woot!. . Love the setup. Very spacious and crisp/clean feel, with chandeliers made of wine glasses and walls lined with glassware. The food was spot on for your typical Vegas buffet. Lots of choices, ranging from Chinese food and pizza to crab legs and prime rib. The dessert selection was awesome. Crepes, shaved ice, gelato, pastries galore.. . We left stuffed and content. Happy I got to try this one out, since we usually hit up Bellagio or Wynn. . . One gripe was the wait list process. We had to wait 1.5 hours just to grab a late lunch and when we finally got our text to "come on down," it was to come on down and stand in another line for about 30 min to get to the cashier, pay, and wait some more for a table to actually open up. Really?? I guess it didn't help that we were all hangry :P
Really enjoyed the buffet hear. I don't think their set up is efficient to handle the all the people that flock in. But big crowds mean they are doing something right. The brisket was so darn good. I wanted to keep coming back for more. Jonah crabs and snow crabs were good as well. The pork was way too salty for me. And the crawfish was okay. I has better. Enjoyed this place for the experience. But I prefer the buffet at the Rio.
My favorite buffet in Vegas.  Food was great, as was the service.  Some of the highlights:  large shrimp that didn't look like they were just thawed out as at other buffets; sweet potato tatertots; made to order street tacos...and the list goes on.  Friendly service as well from start to finish...  I like to go during the week for late breakfast (after 1030) when lines aren't so long.
If you are looking for a buffet with many choices of food, Bacchanal Buffet is the place to try.  So far this is the best buffet I have been to in Las Vegas.  Wherever they place you, there is always a station of food near you.  They have two types of crab (hot or cold), they will cook street tacos on a big stove, chicken and waffles, a bunch of asian food, all kinds of meats and seafood, different juices, a good selection of desserts (yes macarons are there), and many more items.  If I was to name all the foods available the list will go on and on.  The food selection is just insane.  The service is good as they clear plates away often from your table.  . . When I see a pot full of food that I like I would grab a bunch.  If you are like me, it will get you full and then you can't try other foods.  What I like about this place is the presentation for some of the items.  They line up small dishes of the item and it's like a sample size.  The decor is nice and very pleasant.  . . This buffet is really popular so obviously the line can get really long.  The price for dinner buffet is between $50-$60.  The method on obtaining a table is not painful.  First you check into the buffet using one of their machines by placing some information like name, party size, and phone number.  Why the phone number?  Because they will text you or call you when your table is ready.  So during that time when you are waiting for them to call or text you, you can gamble or have a drink to kill some time.  . . Tip:  My friend and I played video poker/blackjack at the small bar near the entrance of Bacchanal Buffet and thebartender comped a drink since we played on the machine.  It's only 25 cents to play each hand of blackjack/poker.
Bacchanal Buffet is by far the best buffet I have ever tried in Las Vegas and overall in my life! A few friends and I went for Sunday brunch/lunch, and the wait was only around 20-25 minutes. The quality of the food is superior, and I highly recommend going to this buffet. First off, the mimosas are bottomless. How can you go wrong with that? The food ranges from dim sum to pad thai to yellow chicken curry to clam chowder to steamed crab legs (that are already cracked open for you) to shrimp (that is already peeled) to dishes that are served on little hot plates. The variety is endless. In addition, the atmosphere of the buffet is classy, modern, and elegant. I was blown away by Bacchanal, and I would definitely go back again.. and again!
I am a regular to Vegas, 2-3x times a year, and have been Diamond with Caesars for years.  Can't say I was very impressed, and most of that hinged on one thing.  Not the food, not the drink service, but the staffing in terms of keeping the tables clear of dirty dishes.. . 4 of us went on a busy Saturday night, naturally it was at capacity as would be expected. Got seated and every empty table we saw was stacked with dirty dishes.  At a $50+ price point for dinner, hire a few more bus staff.  We went up for a second round, came back to the table 10-15 minutes later (yes, buffet is that extensive) all the dirty dishes glasses, etc were right where we left them.  And no, they didn't have a good quantity of food or drink in them, they were clearly done with.  Again, at the price point of $50+  per head, in surroundings that reportedly made it the most expensive buffet to build in Vegas, is the expense to clear tables really that much?  Even the tables that had been vacant for 20 minutes were untouched.  That's a lot of lost revenue by not being able to seat new customers. (Did I mention it was $50+ apiece)?. . To top it off, on the way out I saw a manager near the exit, and mentioned that while the food was good, they need more staff to keep the dining room clear.  His response, that there are plenty of staff, they're just union and lazy.  There's a sentiment for you. I wanted to reply back that perhaps it was more due to poor leadership, management, hiring practices, or just cutting corners on staffing...but restrained myself.  . . Bottom line.  Go next door to Mirage.  Maybe the food isn't quite as high end (but still very good), but still very good, well staffed, clean, well organized, wine and beer included, and save yourself some money.
Best buffet I had in Vegas so far. Amazing food! Pretty pricey as expected but its worth it!
Wow, I've had my fair share of buffets in Vegas and this one holds my medal as of yet. I certainly never eat my share of buffet prices, but the quality and choices got me. There are a few themed sections such as Japanese (with sushi and soups), Chinese, Mexican, American with carving station and mini burgers & hot dogs and seafood all on it's own. Not to mention, a whole dessert bar with mini macaroons & several ice cream choices!. I enjoyed the snow crab legs as they were meaty and sliced lengthwise for easy peeling. The sushi (salmon) was good to me. I did have the stone crab legs which were quite hard to eat as the meat was stuck to the shell. If I'm not mistaken, this can be an indication of overcooking. Sweet and sour soup was pretty yummy and I've had plenty in my lifetime. The mini burgers were quite "meaty" and chosen mostly for its appearance.. Drinks (non-alcoholic) were included within the price (I only mention this because some buffets do not include beverages).. . Buffet ended at 10 pm on Thursday. We arrived at 9 pm and was still seated at regular price of $51+tax/person! The food discontinued serving at 10:30 pm and was plenty of time to eat. . . Service was sufficient and pretty good. . . I'm not quite sure what the other reviews experienced, but I'm going to attribute that to really high expectations.
EXCELLENT buffet. . A little expensive ($60+/pp), and yes, you will wait for at least 30 minutes to get seated, but amazing variety and VERY good food! . Asian station, American comfort food station (w/amazing Mac & cheese, btw), Mexican station, seafood station, meat station, plus a great variety of juices and an exceptional dessert bar. Best flan I've ever had!. Totally worth the price, and the wait, especially if you like seafood.
The saving grace for this place is it's Kind Crab legs. If that goes away, I would not come here again.. . The process to wait is absolutely horrific. They have a "pre-sign up" system and it tells you to come back at a certain time. The time it told my group to come back was in an hour and thirty minutes. I definitely did not expect to be seated immediately at the time the system told me to come back, but I also did not expect an additional 45 minutes to wait to be seated. What is the point of having this system when you're just going to have to wait AGAIN? It makes no sense. . . The rest of the food was not amazing and didn't blow me away to justify the almost 2.5 hour wait.
Wowowow. Best buffet in Vegas if you're down to just go all out on your diet and wallet. It's about $50 which isn't too bad, but the quality of the food compared to other buffets I've been to is top drawer. All I remember and need to remember about this place is the seafood bar, the prime rib (soo goood), lamb chops (even betterr), and the endless dessert bar - I was in heaven! They have mochi ice cream, creme brulee, cakes, and so much more! This buffet is huge and the setup is really nice. Completely worth it!
Yum yum yum!!!! Best buffet in vegas!!!! There is everything and anything your heart desires! Service is phenomenal too! Save room for dessert, and the best part is the big guy cutting all the smoked meats yelling out WELCOME TO BACCANO
This was my second visit to Bacchanal! The first was 25 year ago, then it was amazing and mesmerizing. It was my first BIG VEGAS Dining experience. I remember that long walk back to that corner and those steps that are now gone, boy that was a fun night! I ate so well and drank wine, service was so good and kind, I felt special, and have always loved Caesars Palace since!. . Today I had lunch at the new Bacchanal, I have had it on my short list for some time and although dinner wasn't in the cards this trip lunch today worked out just fine.. . Lets start with me breaking the cardinal rule of no pasta, but I couldn't help myself because I had some BBQ in front of me. both were missteps. The BBQ sauce was off and the meat was too smoky. It was tender and generous, and the mac was grainy and overcooked but still an awesome effort from any buffet. . . The salad bar had been devastated and almost all of the veggies gone and not replenished but I had some arugula, field greens and Maytag Bleu Cheese from the next station, and red wine vinegar, it was stellar..  . Other stand out Items included Chinese BBQ pork, California Roll, although the F&B manager would be proud of the amount of rice used (lots). I enjoyed the Shrimp and crab but not the lobster corn chowder from the seafood station. The Deserts are very cool and all bases are covered. The Peanut butter and chocolate pop was my favorite, but the Oreo mousse was also delish!.  . I had 6 small plates including desert all were good or better, service was efficient and friendly, what more can you ask for. As far as value it was fine, I knew the price and never felt cheated.. . Will I return, you bet, only for dinner! and we shall have wine and celebrate the abundance of food before us!!! I actually cant wait.
Absolute must! I'm Vegas born and raised, and this is beyond the most amazing buffet in Vegas ever. They have EVERYTHING here! Any and all types of food you want that have. Any type of meat anything honestly. When you come herebe ready to spend 3 hours and eat your heart out. Please go there!!!
It was my birthday on September 22, 2014, we usually go to the M resort for the seafood buffet, this time we decided to go to the Bacchanal Buffet instead, what a great decision.  I would vote this the best buffet I have ever been to in Vegas.  The presentation of each station was overwhelming.  The food was delicious and the desserts would blow you away.  I would recommend that if anyone is looking for a great buffet, Bacchanal is the one.  Wanted to go back the next day the food was so great.  Staff wonderful.
I wanted to find a good buffet during my stay in Las Vegas and decided to try Bacchanal. I was relieved to see the line was short around 11:00am today (Thursday) so I decided to try it out. For $38.91 I was pleased with the presentation of the buffet and choices of food as well as the spacious dining area and cleanliness. The beverage server was friendly and kept filling my glass. This place is huge. I didn't realize that there was a second section around the corner from the seafood, meat and potatoes section and Mexican food section until later on which had the salads and a huge Asian food section. There was also the dessert section with an amazing gelato/sorbet bar. My favorite section was the seafood section. I didn't feel like eating any shell fish but on the other side of all the shellfish, hidden away I was very pleased to find a selection of baked Alaskan cod, lobster corn chowder and shrimp with grits each in individual metal containers. The presentation of the cod was beautiful, something you wouldn't expect at a buffet. As far as desserts my favorite was the Creme brulee and Nutella coffee crunch gelato that I topped with Crushed Oreo cookies. Overall I was glad that I came here and felt it was worth every penny.
Always have to hit up a buffet when in Vegas and this is one that should definitely be on your places to eat. Came here on a Sunday brunch ($44/person with unlimited mimosas) and it was worth every penny! The seafood selection is the best I've seen at a buffet by far. I especially loved the crab legs, which you could have boiled and warmed at the pleasure of a staff standing behind the buffet area. And the crab legs are already sliced, opened, ready to eat! No getting messy involved. There is warm butter you pour into a mini cup and once dipped in there the crabs were to die for! I returned twice with full plates in hand.  Also can't pass up the jumbo shrimp, although an oxymoron, these shrimps were the jumbo-ist! The seafood special from the chef's were also delicious, I tried the lobster benedicts-YUM!!!. There is also a Mexican bar, Asian selections, cheese, salad, sushi, a huge variety of meats, pizza, traditional American food, anything you could think of this place has it. And it is GOOD. I thoroughly enjoyed the dessert section which could have reviews entirely for itself. Loved, the crepes! There is a lady who will make them fresh, and add Nutella and powdered sugar if you desire. Then you have a choice of strawberries, bananas, and raspberries to add to top it off! I had two servings of crepes. Ok, we were here for 3 hours and definitely got our moneys worth. . The decor is modern, and sheek, fancy for a buffet and the service is EXCELLENT! She was attentive and cleared our plates immediately when she saw we were finished, and refilled our mimosas always on time =) And the wait wasn't that bad, although you have to pull a number for wait time, our ticket said a 90 minute wait...we waited for 15 minutes tops. I guess it's just a protocol they have to abide by.
Worth the price and wait. If you have no patience then Definitely don't come weekend or holidays.  Lines take a while. Unless you do the kiosk. But plan to eat wayyyyy later than planned if they're busy. They have 9 live food stations. All of them fresh, delicious and plenty of varieties. Their service is great.. . Tacos are to die for..and desserts...well good luck! Even more so if you get seated right by them. . . Oh and tip your waiters good..they deserve it!
Thursday buffet dinner time! Woot woot!! Worth the price! Bf and I went to go eat early because we didn't want to wait in the long line (previous yelpers complaints). There was no line and no wait! We went around 6pm. There are 9 different stations to eat from. I loved the seafood selections. They have cold and hot crab legs at different stations. Seafood, mexican (street tacos), soups, meats, sushi, chinese, american comfort food (chicken & waffles, mini burgers and mini hotdogs), meatballs, pasta, salad bar, fruit bar, and juice bar. The most impressing part was the dessert place. Oh my! I should have tackled dessert first before eating the main courses. They got everything from gelatos, cookies, mousse cakes, cake pops, creme brulee, green tea creme brulee, dipped  chocolate strawberry and suger free sections too. After we overeating we saw the line being super long. We are glad we went early.
Went on a Tuesday nite and the wait was only about 45 minutes. Not too shabby. Now for the food. The seafood and dessert stations are amazing. Endless King Crab, Stone Crab,  Shrimp and Oysters! The crab was really tasty and make sure you try the warm crab station in the Italian section. I did not try all of the stations. I grabbed a slider, tacos, nachos and some pad thai and was not all that impressed. . The dessert station is a dream- loved the chocolate covered strawberries, desserts on a stick and the shaved ice. The shaved ice is on request so make sure to try it- awesome flavors + boba. Skip the cookies (meh).. Ooo and drinks are included so don't try to cheap out by getting ice water. Pepsi for dinner and hot tea and coffee for dessert. Service also top-notch
During my stay in Vegas for the Labor Day weekend, how can I not hit up a few buffets. One of the buffet I went to was Bacchanal Buffet located inside Caesar's Palace. Once my friends and I got pass the 3 step waiting n paying process we were able to indulge in some very yummy foods! The first station I went to was the meat station. WOW they had all kinds of meats prime rib, sausages, brisket, etc. I was only interested in the prime rib. The handful of pieces I had were perfect. I splashed on some horseradish cream and I was in heaven. The next station I went to was the Asian food station -of course! I was surprised they had chow fun and some of my favorite dim sum selections. I was not too impressed with the Italian station and I don't really care for crab legs. The last station I went to was the dessert area. WOW everything was so delish. My two favorite items were the apple pie and the thai ice tea  ice cream. I repeated those items at least 4 times in addition to all the other foods I have already ate. Vegas would not be Vegas without buffets, and I am glad Bacchanal rasied the buffet standard pretty high.
OK, This buffet is pretty good. I mean, a lot of the food is good. There is a lot of variety and choices to choose from, but it seemed smaller than I thought it would be. The wait is kind of long when you get in just to get food. It's really expensive to get in. On a holiday weekend, for 2 it's $136. Damn.. The ambiance is lovely. I loved being able to have a slight view of the pool and the decorations are minimal, it seems. The seats are comfortable and the staff are very attentive are they never kick you out no matter how long you stay there.. I loved the experience here and I did get to try a lot of good food. The macaroons are delicious and the shaved ice is a nice touch since so few places do Chinese shaved ice  compared to Hawaiian shaved ice.. Luckily, I don't like seafood, but if you do, the wait is long. There is always a long line and I've seen people go in quite often to get the food. I enjoyed the assortments of pastas, cheeses, and meats. I liked the little bottles of juices and horchata, too! They are so cute. Of course, leaving here, I felt sick to my stomach with food, but it was a good experience.. Would I come back? Nope. Not even a little, but I have no regrets trying this place.
I've been to this buffet a couple times.  I am not super impressed with this place. I feel the quality of food is lacking. The wait is almost always very long, although they recently implemented their texting method, which they didn't have when it opened. I hate the layout of the food here. Only good thing this place has is that they have a large variety of food and i like their fresh juices in the bottles.
What are you doing reading this review when you can be drinking unlimited amounts of horchata in glass bottles and eating foods from various parts of the world at bacchanal buffet? . . Worth the money. Always finish Vegas off here before heading back home. It's my favorite buffet!
Can I say jaw dropping, salivating mouth and let me stuff my face with endless delightful, good looking and grand variety of feastful food!?!  . . YES and most definitely YES!. . While my girlfriends and I were walking to the table that the hostess was directing us to, I was looking left and right on what the whole buffet place had to offer!  While at it, pre-determining on what to get! . . My eyes were on the savory selections of meat and seafood haven side!  I loved the prime rib, lamb chops, garlic string beans, king's crab legs (were a bit on the salty side), shrimp and oxtail broth with topped green onions served up on the side!  Those were to name some of the highlighted favorites that night!  Don't get the creamy mussels and clams!  A few had a bit of crunch sand to it and I felt like my tooth chipped a little from the grinding of it!  Their oysters didn't look fresh, so I didn't get that.  I dislike the grogginess down the throat when swallowing raw oysters that are not freshly shelled!. . I did leave space for macarons!  My all time favorite dessert!  They had ice cream, creme brulee and more!. . If you are unlike me with carnivor-ing, seafood-ing, then I would suggest the salad bar, dim sum, sushi, tacos and/or pasta bar!. . I would say one of the best buffet (costed $65, it better be) quality restaurants - especially in Vegas!  I also do like the machines that take your reservations so you won't have to wait.  It didn't give us a concise estimate wait time because it over estimated from 90 minutes to an actual 20 minute wait time frame.  A margin difference, I would say. . . I would surely be back for more nom-ing, nonetheless!
Not really worth the $52.99!. Seafoods on hand are crab legs 2 ways (hot/cold), defrosted oyster, crawfish, clams, & mussels. None of them are any good!. . Crabs are salty! Crawfishes are peppery! Clams are blend! Oysters are NOT fresh!. . Sushi is hard.. . I think the only good items were corns & congee.. . Again not worth $52.99!
I was so disappointed at this buffet. I don't eat seafood, so I can't speak for that. Very little choices and subpar quality for the price.
Overpriced low quality food.  For months I heard my friends tell me to go to The Bacchanel. I went there tonight and to be honest it didn't meet my expectations.  The Asian and Italian sections were simplistic. The Chinese food lacked flavor and it seemed I was eating food from any other China Express or food court restaurant.  The Japanese sushi rolls were not fresh and you could see it was low quality fish/crab. The Italian pizzas and pastas were nothing special. As far as the meats, the sausage was ok, but the lamb was so bad I spit it out (I wasn't the only one).  I did not try the American section as I was already dissapointed. I would definately not recommend you to stop by. I think you can eat much better food for the $126 I spend for two.
I usually take my out-of-town guests here once and that's it.  It is a rather large buffet and can be overwhelming with its 500+ items ready everyday.  I enjoy it when I go there simply because its a different food experience every time.  Yes, some complain that its $52.99 pp  but how many times do you come to Vegas or even attempt to even try to conquer this epic buffet.
Went in a Saturday around 6pm and wainted for about 40 minutes. We got seated all the way in the back fr everything.. The cold seafood (crab, shrimp, oysters) was good. The hot seafood was alright, some of it was dry. They had burger sliders which was also amazing. . The macaron texture was good but i didnt like the flavors they had when i was there. Creme brulee was awesome!
A foodies wet dream! Over 500 items. And none are 'throwaway' items. Each seemingly prepared with full attention. Any of the items can easily be featured at a four star restaurant. So much too choose from. Worth the $50 plus especially when a lot of the other dining establishments cost a pretty penny and you don't get what you pay for. Definitely must be checked out on your next visit.
Bacchanal is a place I will continue to visit every time I come to Vegas. We went on a Saturday around 1pm for their brunch.  The $45 per person price included unlimited mimosas, which seemed to be better than average, and they did not skimp on the alcohol.  Wait time from when we first got in line until we were seated was a reasonable 20 mins.  Our waiter Carlos was polite and prompt with our drinks.  The selection was seemingly limitless with their buffet areas broken out in sections, ie a seafood section, breakfast, mexican, italian and asian. Sushi to sashimi to crab legs and claws, it was all there and never in short supply. I started with breakfast, some corn beef hash, bacon, chicken and waffles and red velvet pancakes. All delicious, however the red velvet pancakes were nothing special. The pizza was delicious, as well as some of the ribs they were serving.  If you like desert then you certainly want to save some room, boutique pastries to gummy bears, my favorite was the mango Italian Gelato, I added some to my mimosa and ended up having 3 more. Highly recommend Bacchanal if you are in Las Vegas.
this is my second time at bacchanal and I'm not sure what the hype is all about. the first time I came, I had a fantastic dinner at Picasso so I thought my palette was spoiled but this time I had a side by side comparison and I think wicked spoon has this beat hands down. my girl and I wasted so much food because it was too salty, and the meat was so overcooked.. . add the long wait and expensive price and I'm probably never coming back to this buffet. they aren't going to hurt without my business but I can't take the hype anymore.
One of the best buffets I've ever been to!  I hate to admit this (a sin in my family really..) but I am not the biggest fan of buffets.. I admittedly don't eat that much, and I always feel like I'm torturing my tummy to get my money's worth ): Also, they're a wide selection of food that's usually mediocre at best..  Bacchanal (however you pronounce that), however, definitely changed my mind!  Yes, there were MANY MANY choices, but I honestly did not feel pressured to have to eat everything, because the seafood section was amaaazing!  I cannot tell you how many times I went back for more seafood, especially those fresh oysters. And crab legs. So good. Really the highlight of the buffet I thought.  Their carving station was pretty good too, I enjoyed my ribs a lot. But wow. The seafood.. . Warning - the wait can be kind of torturous, but they have this electronic system where you sign up on the machine and they text you when you need to come back and get in line, which is kind of nice so you can walk around and do some shopping or gambling while you're waiting.  The wait IS about an additional 15 minutes after they text you though.  Also, the "estimated wait time" that they show you after you sign up might not be very accurate.. I'm assuming it's because people drop out. Our estimated wait was 90 minutes, but it only took about 20 for them to textme back. So just be prepared for that!
First off, Id like to say that I had the highest hopes for this buffet. Seeing fellow yelpers reviews/photos made me soo excited!! . . STAFF: very friendly and attentive. Our dirty plates never sat on our table for more than five minutes. I also think it's very helpful that they give Bacchanal first timers a tour of the buffet.. . FOOD: mehhhh. Many of the "hot" dishes were not very hot. It was more like cool/room temperature. It is not fun to eat cold lobster corn chowder (I was VERY excited for this). . . TIPS: wear long pants or a maxi dress! While I was in line for the carving station, someone had dropped a plate and the glass had shattered and got caught between my sandal and foot. There was also a woman between me and the person who dropped the plate. Good thing she was wearing a maxi dress! Lol. . . SIDE NOTE: good thing I looked at yelp pictures before the buffet! There were absolutely NO signs for the food. Like uhhhh I think this is clam chowder? Could be cream of mushroom soup. Who knows!
This rating if not so much for the staff but the food.  The staff was pleasant - can't complain there.  However, for the price and with all the buffet options in Las Vegas, this place does not deserve to have the highest rating on Yelp. Bacchanal should be in the middle of the pack. . . The husband and I were visiting Vegas in September.  We did a buffet a day.  Mirage's Cravings was the best.
Bacchanal is my favorite buffet in Vegas so far. It has the widest selection of foods that is also good quality. There's been too many times where I've been to a buffet that serves oysters, but the oysters aren't fresh. That's not the case at Bacchanal. The oysters were super fresh. The crab legs were amazing as well. You can get them either hot or cold. There's a separate area that serves hot crab legs. . . They also have all kinds of foods like Chinese food with some dim sum, Japanese food like sushi, sashimi. There's a soup station, a Mexican station, a meat carving station, Italian station and more. . . The first time I came here my friend and I both ate six plates each. Yes, you read that right. SIX plates EACH. Yes we are girls. Yes, we love to eat. Now, this time we came even more prepared and we topped that six plate with EIGHT plates each!!!! Yes! Next time it'll be more :). . Now, the BEST part of the buffet is the DESSERT!! I am a huge dessert person so dessert means everything to me. Their dessert section is amazing!! They have everything from macarons to cheesecakes, pies, crepes, ice creams, sorbets and even shaved ice. However the BEST thing that I've had from their dessert section is their green tea creme brulee!! Omg, it was probably the BEST creme brulee I've ever had. And I've had a lot of creme brulee's in during these 22 years of my life. . . Yes Bacchanal may be pricey, but if you have money to splurge on an awesome buffet, then this is definitely the place. Besides, it's Vegas, so who cares? :P
