After reading some of the scary yelp reviews about this airport, I was worried about flying in and out of here. However, It wasn't bad at all. When we arrived, we got our bags quickly and got into the taxi line.  There was about 10 people in front of us and we only waited for about 5 minutes to get a cab.  When we came back again a few days later to go home, security line only took about 10 minutes or so.  Only thing that was annoying.. was that we walked all the way down to our terminal so we could grab some Starbucks.  The Starbucks in our terminal was closed for some odd reason.  There wasn't a sign or anything to explain.. so we had to walk to a complete other terminal to grab Sbux there.  No biggie since we had time before our flight, but I would have been sad if we didn't. The slot machines in the terminals are a fun way to kill time.. but unfortunately, they also kill your money.
I am going to miss flying out of this airport. For being such a large airport it is definitely a breeze to get in and out of. I usually fly united and they are out of terminal 3, which during the day is less crowded as most of the international flights leave later. . Terminal 1 for being so big due to Southwest is actually very easy through security. . . If you need to play slots they are available everywhere in the airport. . . Only negative thing is the luggage sometimes takes a while to come out. Otherwise great airport
Airport itself was fine, fairly clean and new, nice Southwest Skycap service outside.. . TSA at this place was horrible though - I get it can be a frustrating job, especially if a fair number of the passengers are non-English speakers, but that is no reason to berate them.  A couple of the staff were much more engaged in making fun of those that didn't understand than keeping the line moving.  So not only did I feel like they weren't paying attention to the security issues, they were justplain mean.  No dialogue, just yelling more and louder at people who didn't know the routine or immediately comply.. . I fly a fair amount, and usually encounter agents that treat you with respect if you do the same - not the case here.
Come for the parties, booze, jacuzzi, pool parties, and slots. McCarran is the hub for 99% of all travelers that frequent Vegas for any reason. They definitely give you the touristy Vegas feel: slots, poker tables, and lots of sports bars. Booze is all around you, along with the standard expensive airport food and merchandise. Nothing too special about McCarran other than the typical Vegas slot machine and some rad flickering LED screens near passenger pickup. So far, my experiences are good and only experienced one delay out of the handful of trips I've taken to and fro.
Nice airport. Has a lot of slot machines and places to get food/drinks.  Pretty big airport. Looked relatively clean (as clean as an airport in Vegas could possibly be). Reeked of cigarettes, Welcome to Vegas! On the way out: Checking luggage at southwest and getting my boarding pass was very quick. There was a bit of a line but the whole place was pretty well organized. Security was fast and friendly. My gate was super far away, but I guess that just depends on luck. Over all, good experience, no complaints.
During my Vegas Vacay, I had to drop off one of my friend, who had to get back home. I was surprised at how close the airport was to the strip. Maybe it was down time for the airport, but there wasn't much traffic and very easy to navigate. Great job city planners of Clark County!!!
Poor airport layout. Never enough phone charging stations for the amount of people flying through here. Not super clean. Busy always. Wear your walking shoes. Also be prepared for disgruntled workers at the restaurants. 3 stars for location close to the Strip.
It was my first time flying into Vegas from San Diego and vice versa. It was so much better than driving the 5+ hours. The flight was about and hour. It goes by fast. My wife at came in at night, so we got to see the Vegas lights coming in. The airport it pretty nice. Has random slot machines here and there to pass the time if you're here for a while. They have a few good places to grab a bite to eat. I'm thinking if stopping by the Popeyes restaurant to get some food for our flight out. . . After flying, it's going to be hard to drive again. Hopefully the flights will be cheap the next time I'm deciding to come to Vegas.
Feel like I'm at this airport all the time so I know it like the back of my hand. Can't complain. Security lines never take too long no matter how crowded it is, there is always plenty of seating,  gate areas are clean and have free wi-fi. What more can you ask for? Just wished there were more places to eat in the terminal. Since there's not really any good options, I would highly recommend eating before arriving at McCarran if possible
If you're going to run into delays at any airport, it'll be this one. There are nowhere near enough restaurants, shops, bathrooms, or outlets, and they schedule many more flights to depart and arrive than they can handle. It's a no-brainer that Nevada was never prepared for accommodating large amounts of people, but they shouldn't keep adding flights and airlines that they can't accommodate, because people are not getting in and out as they need to. I've flown through here at least 200 times and a majority of those times there was a slight delay departing, although the flights usually arrive as scheduled. It's a disorganized disaster and I'm certain they have the least competent air traffic control team in the country.
Nice music lighthearted jazzy beats and clean bathroom.thanks for the free wifi too none of this drama of watching a video clip first like lax. I prefer this chill music ... I should also mention I am early for a flight and I am NEVER early for a flight so this experience is making me want to be those people who are an hour early for their flights because I've never been so relaxed waiting to fly home from a trip.
Easy to get around, nice wide concourses & plenty of food options.  But there's very minimal recharging stations, so you'll end up battling over a lousy outlet to plug in your charger, and the constant noise from the ever-present slot machines that line every available wall will grate on your nerves in a hurry.  If I have to lay over here, I just pray for a short one.
I have always been happy with McCarran airport.  Always clean and I love the free WiFi. Keep up the good work.
I really didn't like this airport.. . Aside from the fact that it's Vegas and there are slot machines everywhere. The airport doesn't have electrical outlets next to seats or on them. Or even charging stations near the terminals. There's a separated little area for people to charge but it's not near their terminal and there isn't decent seating that people are sleeping, and sitting all over the place. This airport is a mess and given how much money they must be making, they can do better.. . I did want to mention that the free wi-fi is very helpful, but it isn't if you have to sit on the floor to charge your laptop far far away from your terminal so you can't even see the updated boarding time.. . The food inside this airport is pretty bad too and I honestly don't really understand why. Everywhere is better than the Vegas airport, why???. . They really need to improve everything here.
For a city full of metaphorical 'filth' and 'sin', Las Vegas has one of the most clean airports I've ever seen. There are places to sit, eat, shop and check e-mail, read a book or just practise some mindful stillness. It's orderly and it covers the basics, while you wait. Plus, a vending machine of Benefit brand cosmetics. And if you need to scratch your gambling itch, there are ample slot machines for the playing. . . Don't be fooled by the gadget plug-in stand charging you $3.99 for 30 minutes of battery life. It won't work and it takes forever, and the cost is rather high. You would need your phone or other item to be nearly at full, in order to see any significant change. There are no plugs in the wall for using tech gadgets, so ensure you find a space at the tables attached to the wall, alongside the terminals. This is a minor issue, but was not as troublesome as LAX, surprisingly. Maybe not as many people pushing and shoving for sockets? . . Security is also incredibly efficient here. Shoes are not required to be removed, nor laptops from their cases, and they use various other methods of facial recognition and safety that are not widely used in the United States. The lines are long, but move fast.
I love Las Vegas!  I live in northern San Diego, and the drive to Vegas can be a 5 hour drive. With traffic, it can definitely be longer, especially the trip back to San Diego. The flight from sd to Vegas is approximately 50 minutes.  . . I came in on a Tuesday night so it wasn't too busy. There was no cab line but it looks like it can get long. It looks like the line to get into Splash Mountain at Disneyland!  I've been told the line goes by fast though.  The cab ride to the Cosmopolitan Hotel was about 17 bucks.  . . I had time to eat while waiting for my flight to go back home. The airport is pretty big and there's a few food choices. I was debating on Nathan's or Popeyes. I ended up getting Popeyes and it didn't disappoint.  . . Unfortunately, this airport isn't new enough where there are outlets next to the seats waiting at your gate. There are few charging stations if you need to charge your phone. I'm assuming on a busy day it can get hard to get a plug. Just try to have a full charge when you get here. . . And yes, there are slot machines at the airport!
I love this airport because I love Vegas! Hahahaha. . BUT, with that said, this can be one of the busiest airports I've been to, and it's mostly because I come in on the weekends, when everyone else is pretty much coming and going to vegas.. . But as far as the airport design is concerned, you have to take a tram from certain terminals, depending on your flight...I believe AA, US Airways(now american), and Southwest are definites for tramming it to baggage, but not sure which other airlines.. . ARRIVING - be prepared to get into a long line for taxi service.  The line moves incredibly fast as the taxi cab system setup here is second-to-none as far as efficiency is concerned, but the line IS long.. . DEPARTING - arrive early, a TON of flights take off around the same time, so security lines can get quite long, but once you're past security, it's pretty much smooth sailing.  . . PARKING - short-term parking if you're picking up a friend is easy and convenient.. . CAB RIDES - it's cheaper to take side streets to the strip by about $6 or $7, just emphasize that you wanna take local streets and not the freeway, which can end up costing you about $25
I really like this airport. They have done a great job remodeling and upgrading it. It's nice and clean. The tram system is very smooth easy to use. Lots of shops and bathrooms. Plenty of restaurants and bars to relax in. They also have a few enclosed smoking areas if you have to smoke.
I've been to tons of airports and this is actually a good one, they have the whole monorail system implemented here to take you from where you enter and go through TSA to where you can access the gates. Just like the strip the stores and restaurants here have big and lit up signs.. . The first indication that you are in Sin City when you arrive and step off the place is the numerous slot machines spread all throughout the airport. I even saw an enclosed room with slots and they allowed smoking in there, odd for an airport to have that but ok.. . There are plenty of shops to get tourist nic nacs, books and etc. but they also have regular retail stores such as Coach and The Flip Flop Shop. They also have a wonderful selection of food and beverage places here. Cinnabon, Jodi Maroni's, Chili's, and CPK just to name a few.. . I wouldn't mind having to be here for a few hours waiting for a flight because the slots, shops and restaurants will keep me occupied.
This is not one of my favorite airports. It is usually crowded, maybe to the point of over crowded and needing expansion. Baggage pickup is somewhat difficult. And the worst, everyone exits at the same place and has wait in the same crazy cab line. Lots of thingshere seem like poor planning to me.
Why? They have a ton of Wells Fargo ATMS here. If I need to take out cash I can do so without paying the ridiculous fees at the casino. Taxi lines are relatively fast and so are the TSA lines. I say.... I'm a fan because it's efficiently run (for the most part) and it's not an intimidating airport. . Hello- Jersey Mikes, Popeyes, Wendy's, UFC, Brighton and Hudson News!!! All of the pretty shiny oldish slot machines take advantage of me every single time too. I would play the quarter machines over the penny slots. Lower max bet!
This is a great airport. The TSA staff are always friendly and efficient, the food selection is pretty good, it's well-kept and there are videos playing in loops about airport security starring Vegas performers like Carrot Top and the Blue Man Group.. Terminal 3 seems a little cold and heartless and half-deserted most times of day, but it's better than many other airports I've visited despite that. The only major issue is a lack of dining *before* security; Terminal 3 has a Starbucks and the main one has a Tex-Mex joint. Once inside you'll find sit-down places and the ubiquitous Sbarros and Burger Kings.. There are recharge stations but there could always be more; there's often a crowd during even somewhat-busy times. All in all, a nice place to pass through or fly into or out of; drop by one of their many slot machines of you want that Vegas gambling experience whilst there.
Every other airport is lame compared to this place. Talk about a city that never sleeps! This airport is 24 hours and yes you can gamble your life savings away while waiting for your delayed flight on spirit airlines. the best thing to do when you get to the baggage claim is yell loudly "VEGAS!!!!" And you'll blend in with the underage teenagers waiting to head to the clubs to listen to their electronic uncle uncle unce unce.
Love that you don't have to go through too much security drama at this airport. They get you in and out.
I realize that a lot of people bash this airport but as a frequent business flyer and local this is one of the best airports in the country for USA and Canadian city non-stop flights.   Flying non-stop is important and as the 9th busiest airport in the country it moves a vast amount of people efficiently and in an energetic and clean environment.   If you want to experience truly crappy airports try using either LAX or its little cousin Ontario.   They both resemble 3rd world airports with dirty and closed amenities and hordes of people. . . On my wishlist I would like to see McCarran develop a cell phone waiting lot and a reduced price for long term parking.   Other than that it is a fine airport!
Decent airport easy to navigate through. Slot machines are readily available giving you that Vegas vibe!
It's Vegas!  But one of my least favorite airports.  It just doesn't seem to have that Vegas feel anymore and it always takes me longer to get though.   I will say I away seem pretty happy to get there and very very happy to leave there!  Wonder why that is? :)
Just when you think it's time to go home and get away from all the gaming, there are slots all up in that casino. Of course though, right? You are still in Vegas! . . The airport itself is located 5 minutes from the beginning of the strip, which makes picking up a friend or catching a cab yourself super super easy and convenient.. . There are plenty of different food choices inside the airport (unlike some other cities) if you get there early and are hungry.. . I hate driving to Vegas, so I think I found my new alternative!
For the most part I love McCarren in airport it's in and out!! And Southwest is the best!! All the workers walking around are so friendly and nice and helpful. It's also fun to play the slots while waiting on a guest to arrive..
Why does it have to be so cold here??. Nobody check the temps in this freezer airport??. 2 stars for finishing with the construction but non for the climate control!. Please keep this place airport temp, thank you : )
Being that I take the overnight flights I have good experiences at McCarran. I walked right to the security desk practically waking the guard up and passed with ease and right through the scanning area. Plenty of stores and eateries stay open late and the fact that there are slot machines seem to keep that dream of hitting a jackpot alive for some people. Free WiFi is what I take advantage of, watching something on Netflix of HBO Go makes the time fly by while waiting to board. Definitely an easy airport to navigate through if you are departing or arriving. Even though passenger pickup can be crazy at times, I find it convenient to pick up friends or family without having to pay to park, which is still an option.
Place is huge.. . Has added a new terminal (#3) which I only have arrived at when using JetBlue.. . When using Southwest I have arrived at Terminal 1.. . Many food options. Place is really organized.. . You can catch taxi and shuttles here.
