I took my cousin from Pasadena to the Scottsdale location and the service was horrible! I had to keep asking the waitrss for things and finally she just stopped coming to our table. Yes I understand they were busy ( Full of white people ) and they had to focus on the other guest but what about us? My cousin asked for the waffles with the whipped cream and strawberries and the waitress asked if she was sure? I assume she asked cause my cousin is overweight !! We got the meal without the cream and strawberries and took the hint. We paid and left and will NEVER RETURN!!
This is one of my go to places to feel great about myself. I work by the Scottsdale location but have fallen in love with the downtown Phoenix location. The people there are so great and combined with yummy food you can't help but feel good when you leave. I always am tempted by the specials but keep going back to the #8. Try it out if you get a chance. You won't be disappointed.
My favorite Chicken & Waffles spot. I have actually intentionally took a layover in PHX on my way to the West-coast and take a cab with Luggage just to enjoy there inviting hospitality, Food and KoolAid in a Mason jar on tap!!! And now I get word that there's one in the PHX Airport... I'll be there soon.
We've been fans of Lolo's for years and just stopped by again today for lunch. Seriously great food. We had a chicken and waffle plate, and a catfish and red beans meal. Everything was wonderful, including the service. It might strike you as a little pricey, but they give you plenty of food (the corn bread muffins are a meal in themselves). Always a long wait but totally worth it.
This is my first time coming back to Lo-Lo's since it's been renovated. I really liked the grungy, homey, non-corporate feeling of the smaller location. The food seems to be about the same but the ambiance changed it all.
Amazing! Most people do the Scottsdale location, but you really need to check out this original location ( the 1st LoLo's) and see how it all started. For some reason I think the food taste better here.. . Update the 1st local is no more but has been relocated to a new building just a few doors down the street. Also there is now a location inside Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor Airport.
Smack your mama good food. Found this place by accident and it was the best accident of the year. Their service isn't great, but the food.is so good you won't notice.
Our FIRST visit for lunch.  Had a WONDERFUL time.  Greeted at the front door by the manager.  When we sat down, AJ, our server, energetically pointed out all the fantastic food on the menu.  I got the veggie plate with Smothered potatoes, Spicy green beans, fried okra, and mac and cheese.  Was so much, had to take most of it home.  Cornbread was huge with a mound of butter on the top.. . My lunch partners got the fried chicken salad which was great with candied walnuts and avocado.  Another got the Chicken Tender basket.. . The food was incredibly hot, fresh, and delicious.  Service was prompt, friendly, and highly attendant.  . . These folks KNOW how to do it right.  A friendly and welcoming environment.  We will bring our friends and come back soon.
Today, I was very disappointed by the rude reception I received at the Central Phoenix location.   This employee brought it to my attention in a very harsh and annoying way that I used the wrong door.  I had read reviews about the Scottsdale location.  Customer Service is not favorable.  I will never spend money here again.
If you're like me from Los Angeles & looking for a replacement for Roscoes then this is NOT the place. I wish they would just call it LoLo's & not get my hopes up. The food was decent nothing special. Good size portions & our server was wonderful!  Maybe we came on a bad day cuz our eggs were way overdone & potatoes under done. I wish the waffles were crispier but now I'm just being picky.  The chicken was decent but seriously nothing compare to Roscoes so that's my mistake for thinking anything could. I may go back & try their lunch or dinner & see how that tastes. Complimentary valet at the front was great & they give you a cold water on the way out.
My husband is from the south and is very particular about his fried chicken.  He loved it!!  The staff is super friendly and I really love the fried green tomatoes.  I can't wait until the Gilbert location opens.
Lolo's Chicken & Waffles!! Where do we start. . . We had a large party (12 to be exact) and everything turned out great. Seating policy is that everyone in the party must be present before the party is sat, so even if certain people come early to reserve seating, you won't be put on the list until everyone arrives. . . Cannot remember our servers name but she was fabulous. Did a great job. Ordered #4 with two waffles and two chicken and it was awesome !! . . However, the best part of the meal was the sweet tea. If I could come here everyday for that sweet tea I would. (This is not an exaggeration. That tea was brought here by the tea gods themselves) . . Highly recommend!
The building is adorable, brick wall warehouse feel. Complimentary valet is also nice. OH & they gave me my beer in a paper bag, hood style, which was pretty cool.. . As far as the food, I should have just ordered appetizers because my meal was horrible!. . Appetizers included fried pickles, fried green tomatoes, & fried corn fritters. All of which were delicious.. . I ordered the veggie plate which was just a ton of bland food.. . Service was slow, our orders were wrong, and overall the food is nothing special but very overpriced.. . I don't think I'll ever go back.
I just experienced this restaurant for the first time tonight and I have to say I was very skeptical at first.  Chicken and waffles couldn't possibly go well on the same plate..  But it was amazing!  Delicious!  And the employees were all very fast and efficient.  Every person greeted us with a smile and I left with absolutely no negative thoughts. I'm going to recommend this restaurant to everyone!
I heard about this restaurant and had to try it.  Did not disappoint.  The parking lot was full and there was a wait to eat on a Monday at 2:00.  It was worth it!  Unbelievable fried chicken, waffles were amazing & the sides..,,WOW!  My husband went back the next time he was in town and brought home food to eat family style for the rest of us.  No leftovers.
Food was excellent as always. Chicken was seasoned to perfection and waffles were fresh and hot. Worth the wait
Went to Lo-Lo's for lunch to try the Phoenix version of chicken and waffles. I ordered the Toy Toy and added 2 wings to the meal. I'm actually glad that I ordered 2 additional wings because my wings seemed pretty small to me. I have had chicken and waffles from the east all the way to the west and these were just ok to me. I would certainly go back and try other dishes and encourage all who have never been to check them out. The lemonade happened to be my favorite part this time around with the perfect blend of lemons and brown sugar.
