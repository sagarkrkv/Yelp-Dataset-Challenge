I have never tried a Korean Mexican fusion so we had to come here and see what it was all about. Pretty good food. Couldn't taste much of the Korean fusion, but all still good. . . Fish taco (4 stars): Liked these tacos the most. Had the most flavor. . . Shrimp taco (3 stars): Shrimp are so tiny! Wish I would have known it was baby shrimp. . . Chicken Fries (3.5 stars): A little bland. Needed more flavors. We loaded on hot sauce haha. I lived in San Diego for 4 years where Mexican food ruled, so these cannot compare to the pollo asado fries I would get down there.  . . Complimentary Cips (4 stars): Crispy and good! So addicting to munch on.  . . SERVICE (5 stars). Everyone was really nice. . . ATMOSPHERE . Almost like a fast food restaurant but not since you can sit down and they will come to get your order. Clean tables. Got pretty busy towards closing time.
If only this place was closer to where I lived!. . Anything with the word Bulgogi here is amazing. I had the burgers and it was just an amazing mouth watering experience! It's kind of like if Roberto's met a hole-in-the-wall Korean joint.. . You have got to try this place!
What a great idea to fuse Korean and Mexican. The atmosphere is very relaxed, its looks kind of divish, but the food is so good. You cant go wrong with any of the tocos, I wish they would open one on the South side of town.
Very small place and gets crowded during lunch rush hour, but my review isn't about that.... . There were so many choices I didn't know what to get! I tried a little of everything so I ordered:. . Bulgogi burrito. Bulgogi fries. Bulgogi Kim Chee taco. . . The burrito was tasty and bulgogi was tender. I love that it had Kim Chee (you have to ask for it) which gave it an extra tang. I wasn't too fond of the rice, as it was lacking in flavor and a bit mushy. . The fries looked delicious at first, but was hard to eat as the cheese quickly cools making it hard to have a perfect bite. I thought it was just ok, and would easily skip on my next visit. . The taco was pretty tasty, the only con is that there's too much liquid from the Kim Chee that it makes the tortilla soggy and breaks it. It was pretty messy. . . All in all, the items were good, but I'd just stick to the burrito. I'm eager to try more items off their menu since I enjoy the Korean Mexican fusion concept.
Wejust beat the rush, but the line can get pretty long. We saw it build up while we were there.. . Korean and Mexican fusion. Sounds a little weird right? Maybe, but the food is good!!! I'm not as high on it as some of the other Yelpers,  but I still put it pretty high on my list.. . So what's actually pretty awesome about this place is that they have ZERO problem splitting checks for you. Unlike other places that say they will but give you this reluctant only-if-I-get-a-good-tip attitude, our server split up our party of 12 with NO problem. Go in, eat,  pay your bill, bounce. You don't have to sit there for 30 minutes trying to figure out what everyone ordered and how much they owe for tip.. . Bulgogi Burrito ($7.50). Pretty huge burrito. I had to split because it was too big. The bulgogi portion is plenty, which is always nice. However, the taste of the bulgogi wasn't anything spectacular to me, just "pretty good".. . The tacos were pretty popular at our table, so I'd definitely recommend getting that.
Don't judge a book by it's cover. Not the prettiest place, but the food was outstanding!  Service was great. I ordered the tacos: shrimp, bulgogi, and carne asada. Excellent! My daughter (9 years old) ordered a burger and fries. It was tasty too. A new found gem!
Great food and flavor and the bulgogi had an awesome taste. The staff was friendly and its great food with a great price. I recommend the bulgogi fries to everyone
This place is putting out some pretty tasty food.  It is located in a small outdoor strip mall and you might miss it as it is tucked away in the corner.  I have been here several times and each time the food is very good.  I usually order one of the fusion items, which is a nice mix of Korean and Mexican.  I have had the bulgogi  and spicy pork tacos which are loaded with meat and other ingredients; these are delicious.  I have also had the spicy pork fusion torta, which was huge and very tasty.  This was a great mixture of flavors.  The fusion (bulgogi) chimichanga was also great.  The dishes are very flavorful and loaded with ingredients.  All of the dishes I have tried thus far have a great mixture of texture, spice and complexity of flavor.  This is deffinitely one of my go to places when in that part of Las Vegas
Awesome food. Everything fresh cooked. Must visit if in Vegas
Asian-Mexican Fusion! I recommend the Bulgogi Nachos..they are amazing. As much as everything pretty much. So much food for $! Don't be put off by the sketchy neighborhood, cause you know it will be good
Don't eat here. Just finished my meal. Ordered the kimchee fried rice which already comes with an egg but I wanted it scrambled. When I got my bill they had charged me $1 for the egg.When I asked why, the manager said for labor. Never in my life have I experienced something so ridiculous as being charged $1 for a scrambled egg instead of a fried egg.
Bulgogi fries and Kim chee fried rice is bomb!
**A divey, mom-n-pop shop serving up fusion Korean-Mexican food. Food is tasty and prices are cheap. Seems to be a favorite amongst the Yelp community. I recommend the Pork Belly Fusion Taco.**. . Some burrito-guru site rated KoMex in the top ten best burritos in the US. Hahaha... no. Whatever... it got me to try this place, twice. . . Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad place. If you like the famous Koji Taco trucks in LA, you'll like this place. And the prices are really reasonable. I pig out for around $15 (including tax and tip) but you can easily eat here for around $10. . . FOOD: KIMCHI FRIED RICE, this dish has a lot of potential, but for some reason the meat gets lost in all the kimchi and rice. Second time I went back I got three meat choices instead of one (for $11) and I liked how the pork stood out from the kimchi but the beef still got lost in all the flavors. This dish is so frustrating because I wanted to like it, so bad! But it just falls short on my palate. Maybe next time I'll ask for 3x the pork. . . PORK BELLY FUSION TACO $2, This is my favorite dish here. There's satisfying slabs of pork belly, on top is a crunchy corn salsa and cabbage. I liked the corn tortillas too but I'm not sure if they're homemade. . . FUSION BURRITO WITH BULGOGI $7.50, believe it or not, their famous burrito was my least favorite dish here. Just think of it was carne asada burrito made with bulgogi instead of carne asada. It sounds good in theory but the bulgogi got lost in the translation here. I think a bulgogi taco would taste better, the proportions would work better. . . MEXICAN BURRITO WITH CARNE ASADA $7.50, actually tastes better than it's fusion cousin. It's a good carne asada burrito, nothing special, I really like their pico de gallo. . . NEIGHBORHOOD is a bit sketchy. It's located in a run-down strip mall off of Decatur North of the 95. The place is divey and small but clean. Service was okay. I  liked the complimentary chips, guacamole and salsa. Their salsa and hot sauce are really good.
I love Komex. I recently tried a place with the same concept in Atlanta and was highly disappointed. Komex has set my Korean fusion standard pretty high I guess. The bulgogi nachos are amazing. I definitely  recommend.
We ate tony Roma's the night before, it was pretty good.... That being said this place blew that food out of the water! I will be going back Everytime I visit Vegas
This place is divey.. clean.. but divey.  It's like the Roberto's of Korean Mexican fusion except I probably would have preferred Roberto's. Maybe I went in with the wrong mindset, I'm used to Korean food being somewhat healthy and I know depending on the Mexican food you could be looking at the perfect post-drunk grease or something you won't feel ashamed of after you've consumed it.  This food made me feel like I was clogging my arteries midway through the meal. The flautas with spicy Korean pork were somehow bland.  I don't even know how this is possible when spicy pork (mewoon daeji bulgogi) is anything but bland and it's the filling.  I got corn tacos with kalbi and spicy pork, they were okay.  My friend was destroying the kimchi fried rice, I'm not the hugest fried rice fan so I don't feel it's fair for me to try and review it.
I was very excited to try this place, meaning I paid almost $60 in cab fare to come out and try this place (we stayed at the Bellagio), but I was so disappointed!!. . The meat was not tender at all, especially the pork. The chicken is tasteless. The misubi was way too salty. The portions was not huge as many yelp reviews said it was. The only thing I liked from the mountain of food is the beef kimchi fried rice. But it wasn't spectacular. Any decent korean place will taste just as good. . . Here is what we ordered:. Beef kimichi fried rice: very good. . Combo two meat plate: horrible. Chicken was tasteless. The pork was like ground pork, mushy, which was really weird. . . Pork belly misubi: way too salty. I took one bite and threw it away. . . Chicken wings: okay. Drenched in sauce. . . Shrimp and chicken tacos: okay. Nothing too special about it that you can't get from a taco truck.
I heard of this and had to try it. Korean mexican fusion oh my it was delicious. A little mom n pop place that serves huge portions of great food at an even better price. At table of 5 and we all ordered plates 2 appetizers and an extra plate of rice and we only paid 65.00. Anything with the bulgogi and you can't go wrong. The bulgogi flautas and the chicken fried rice were my favorites.  We got lucky and got a table quick but it soon filled up and there was a wait. You must try this place.
