AVOIDING THIS PLACE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN DONT BE FOOLISH. I just had a dinner last night and their fishes are not fresh at all so in the morning I threw up and found out I'm food poisoning. All I threw up was albacore, scallop, and some tunas !
It was just "ok" if you don't know what good sushi is them you will probably love it.
A Vegas fav!!! I come out to Vegas ever so often and this is a usual stop. I usually get AYCE which is around $22-$23 a person--don't quote me on that. What's really good is the salmon and other fish collar that is underneath the appetizer section. Other than those two items, you can find the typical menu items that you usually find in any sushi place. Dessert also comes with AYCE with a choice of one mochi ice cream ball or a scoop of regular ice cream.. . My only complaint about this place is the location. Every time I've been here, I've either seen people get into fights, couples cussing each other out, or have a ton of shady people approach you for money. But once you get inside, all is well and yummy!
Gross & ouch for my mouth. While eating there was something that kept poking the inside of my mouth. I wanted to throw up the food. . . There were fish bones inside the sushi roll and when I had asked one of the workers they said it was normal and that you can eat it. The sushi is so gross here and doesn't taste fresh at all. . . . Service needs to be worked on tremendously also. We had sat down BEFORE these 3 other men but however when we wanted to order she said she'll be back. Next thing we know she wastaking the other people's order and then left and never came back for our order. Someone else had to take it. When she had came back to our table she was showing much attitude and didn't seem to want to tend to us at all. . Will never be coming back.
There were 13 of us. This sushi place accomodated all of us and put us in a seperate room that had a table big enough for all of us. Even when we were still waiting for the rest of our group, they had reserved the table for us. All of us had All You Can Eat, must I say it is worth it. This place is very efficient, you order, a few minutes later yimou'd be eating some of the best rolls and appetixers you'd ever have. Our servers were Andrea and Ingrid, then an Asian lady with a #1 tag on her uniform. They were all nice and friendly. I definitely recommend this place, specially to sushi lovers and to people who likes to eat out with groups of friends!
Been here a couple times and it's been a hit and miss. I ordered the garlic tuna and could barely stomach it-by far the worst I've had. It just didn't taste right and was off and weird. The other rolls I had were decent as well as the appetizers. . The bento box I had was the only thing I've enjoyed so I'm just going to stick to that if and when I come here . . There are so many other choices for ayce sushi that's the same price and better quality. Not my favorite, but it's an ok place.
Looked for a place to eat in the area , opened yelp and saw a four star four for this place, I have to say that I agree. . Food is great, price was great ( $20.99 for all you can eat lunch 11am-3pm) and service was on point. . I was reading that some people had a problem with the service - I don't know if they were reading your comment or what but I couldn't take a sip of my water and someone was there for a refill. App came quick also. . Go there during lunch , sit for an hour at least and enjoy the food :)
The best Sushi Restaurant I've been to yet all the way around. The staff, quality of food and service are top notch! I've tried many different All-You-Can-Eat Sushi Bars and so far I have not been able to find another that's remotely comparable!
My boyfriend and I are from Orlando, and had just completed a Death Valley NP trip. We were looking for some fantastic local food away from the strip, and had to try this place considering all of the YELP reviews. We arrived at 3 minutes before 6:00 p.m., just at the cutoff of the Happy Hour special. Fortunately, the waiter rushed us to our table and got an order in for us so our ticket would be clocked in before 6:00 p.m.! Nice!. . Our waiter was extremely attentive, knowledgable, and very nice. He made sure our waters were always full. My boyfriend ordered only 1 beer, but our waiter took such a liken to us, that he would bring him another beer (for FREE!), three more times! Wow!!! . . The head chef visited our table as well, and asked if we had tried his signature dish yet. Why no, we haven't!!! He ordered for our table a plate of yellowtail sashimi with sauce (for FREE), for us to try. All this, while knowing that we are from Orlando and won't be a repeat customer anytime soon. . . The fresh was surprisingly extremely fresh, I mean, we are in the desert here! Happy Hour has some incredible deals and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!. . We were charmed by the staff and how pleasant and attentive they were to us!!! We can't say enough about how please we were with the service, on top of, the spectacular food!
I've tried so many sushi places here in town and this one has been by far the most superb one! Poaw the sushi dude is amazing!!! I'm a regular there so I never have to order anything. Plus they have hamachi Kama which most places only have salmon Kama if they have Kama. The house always treats me to a large sake! Super friendly service and fresh food!!!! Love love love this place!!!!!!
Monkey only supposed to have a beer with friends before leaving town...  And jeez, we just left our new favorite restaurant. . . Guess we beat the Friday night dinner rush at 530p. Seated in about 20mins, servers are numbered, move quickly, take your orders and zip away in a flash. It's a busy AYCE, so they gotta move!  . . Kudos to server #12 (Go HAWKS!!!)who took note of everything:  who is eating AYCE and who is not, got every single order delivered and kept a sharp eye out for every time someone wanted another order. Somebody... Ordered extra Collars and guess who had to put them all down to avoid the Leftover Food Charge. Eat it all or they will charge you for that dish. Not this Monkey!. . Monkey do:. LG ASAHI - of course!. SALMON KAMA - huge hunka fish. HAMACHI KAMA - charred slightly but perfect and also a big fish. AGEDASHI TOFU - plentiful . and then helped kill. HAMACHI KAMA. DBL SALMON ROLL - salmon avocado over rice, not so smoked salmon & cucumber. . SOFT SHELL CRAB(deep-fried) Eh. . SEAFOOD SALAD - Wow! Big pile of raw fishes!  . . We wobbled outta there to find families and groups waiting probably forever to eat. At $23.50 ea for Dinner, it's a good deal if you want more than 2 rolls and a beverage. Monkey's coming back(before 530p) for the seafood salad, collars and a beer. Count on it!
Love this place! It's my favorite! My roommate and I come once a week. Best sushi in town!
Been going here for years all you can eat at the top of line sushi and are the chefs here fast the service is great
If you want to throw down all you can eat sushi, this is a good spot. They have all the standards with a quite few specialty rolls. There are times at dinner there is a long wait. Its not 5 star worthy, but for the money it's good.
I have been coming to this sushi place for years. In my opinion it is hands down the best sushi place in Las Vegas. Every time i sit down they remember my name and the first few dishes that I always order. They make my dining experience personalized and fun. The fish is always fresh and delicious. I would recommend Yama sushi to anyone I know!
Really not sure why this place has 4 stars. My husband and I have been here several times and its always been ok not great. Well a few days ago we went to try it again and it was horrible. The server we had was extremely rude, forgot about our drinks and sushi. Once we actually got our sushi (we ordered rolls and nigiri) it was disgusting, lacking flavor and did not taste fresh. We asked to speak to the manager and she promised it was fresh well it wasn't and we couldn't even finish our first order. We both ended up feeling miserable after and will not be back.
I wanted to see if all the reviews about this place were correct.. They didn't do this place justice. It was the best sushi I've had in a long time. I went for the unlimited sushi and I couldn't stop eating. It wasn't after 32 rolls that my stomach said no more and I decided to tap out
Dinner price is about $30/person after tip.  I think it's pretty well worth it.  The fish was fresh and came out in a timely manner.  A lot of the rolls are california roll based, as expected, but decently flavored.  They also serve large sweet shrimp and uni (1/person) which were very fresh.  . . I like this place compared to other AYCE sushi places because of the variety.  They have tons of rolls and appetizers to choose from.  Make sure to try and call ahead of time to make a reservation - or be prepared to wait a long time.
This place tried to kill me I explained to them that I could not have anything with shellfish (shrimp, real crab...etc.) I AM ALLERGIC!!!!!!!!they even wrote it on my ticket. I ordered several rolls on the 3rd roll  what do they do they serve me a roll with shrimp in it. I did not realized it contained shrimp because there was quite a bit of topping on it. My mouth felt tingly I instantly started drinking water to help with my reaction. I called for a manager of which was not prompt at all, she was so worried about the bill being paid for my two friends (of which she did not charge me for mine) instead of me getting medical attention. By God's grace I did not consume a whole lot I did not need medical attention. Even though I did have a mild reaction.......BEWARE!!!!!!!! they don't follow instructions!!!!!!
The All You Can Eat is EXCELLENT... huge menu to order from including appetizers, soups, salads, and desert to go with the hashimi and sushi rolls (over 60 different ones).  You can order half rolls to in order to be able to try more rolls without having to eat any entire roll.  Some items can only be ordered once per person (denoted by a red heart), but it's not a big deal.. . You must get the seafood salad if you like sashimi (that is the closest you will get to sashimi when getting AYCE).  It is excellent.. . Great deal for only $24 for dinner.... if you get 2 rolls and a drink, it's usually more than that.. . Military discount only if you are in uniform.
