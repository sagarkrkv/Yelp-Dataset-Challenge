Wow, we came hungry, then couldn't move...lol. . I love me some steak., and the Flank was perfect. All the meats were great.  When it came down to deserts,  I was done. Wifey ordered the Cheesecake. Just 1 taste,  and I fell over.
This is a MEAT LOVERS DREAM!! The first time I went to eat here, I thought I died and went to Heaven. WOW. Ok, back to the review......I have eaten here many times (I try to go about every 3 months) and everytime its simply amazing. If you like MEAT and I mean high quality, delicious, hot of the grill MEAT.....then this place is for you! Its AYCE (all you can eat) so GO HUNGRY. There is a delicious well planned Salad Bar that is very good....but I go for the MEATS. The server will bring you: HOT and FRESH bread balls with cheese inside, Red Skin mashed potatoes and some delicious Fried Bananas (those sides are bottomless and AYCE). The price per person is about $45 (adults) and I think the kids are free or a minimal charge. Drinks are pricey, Desserts are good....but you will be too full to eat it..... no free refills on sodas :( ....................but I go every chance I get! I love this place!
I come here once a month with some friends for very important "meatings"! This place is as they say in Brazil, "is baest". After trying the other Brazilian steakhouses in Vegas this is the business!
I have to give this restaurant 1 star because of a single employee's lack of interest in doing her job. A friend and I went into the restaurant a few days ago to see if they were open for lunch. We saw a young woman working at the podium and asked if they were open. She was on the phone, looked at us, and held up 5 fingers. Not being sure if that meant to wait just a minute, we stood there and waited. After maybe 3 minutes, she showed no intention of helping us or even getting off the phone. She wouldn't even look at us as I made it clear that we were looking for the website to see if they were open. She was on the phone still, now laughing at the conversation. It sounded like a personal call. I asked once again "so you guys aren't open?", and got completely ignored. So we left, not able to dine there since we weren't able to find out from them if or when they'd open. We could smell food cooking from outside, so we assumed they were open. After we left, we took our business to a nearby competing restaurant, and I had probably best steak I've ever had in my life there (Filetto Di Manzo Toscano at Brio Tuscan Grille). I recommend everyone try the steak there. The service is also far superior, as their employees aren't making personal phone calls and ignoring customers.  I would have liked to try Texas de Brazil, but honestly with such a bad first impression, it doesn't seem like it's worth it.. . This happened on Tuesday, September 9th, around 12:35pm.  I would encourage management to look into who was working the podium at that time and have a talk with her about priorities.
I'm normally not a meat eater, but this place had me tasting everything. Everything was very good and the service was great as well. Everyone was very nice and helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone and just make sure you come ready to eat. The chicken Parmesan, filet mignon and beef rib was the best that I liked out of all the selections of meat brought to our table and their lobster bisque was on point! LOVED this place :)
This place is beautiful and close to the Mandalay Hotel. The food is great.. The service is a little lacking professionalism, but okay.. I don't think it was worth the money you pay for what it offers.
Where a man can be a man and eat like a dang Viking.  Slabs of meat come at you in waves.  So many types of meats in so many cuts.  A man is in heaven.  It's costly but Damn worth it.  You pay for what you get and then some.  I've been here several times and never ever been disappointed. Lunch is cheaper with almost the same amount of meat cuts
My wife and I met an old friend who was in town and hankering for a really good steak, . . The absolute best part was our server, Anne. She set the tone for our entire meal. She was perfect in every respect. It was our first time and she explained everything  in what sounded to me to be a genuine and very charming Brazilian accent.. . This is not the place for our vegan or even vegetarian friends...This is a meat lover's paradise, with a non-stop  delivery (if you have your little coaster turned to green) of some very tasty, chicken, pork, lamb, and beef... it is brought to you on giant skewers and either slid off onto your plate in a medium size portion or sliced off a very large piece, like with the leg-of-lamb. If you leave your coaster on green you will be offered different meats every 5 minutes or so... turn it to the red side and they won't bother offering any when they come by.. . The salad bar is very impressive as well, with a great selection fruit and veggies.  It is easy to over do it on the salads so beware if you want to have room for the delicious meat offerings.. . I did not care for the "traditional brazilian bread" on the table... It was more like very salty cheese balls than bread... with the meats and all I surely went way over my normal daily sodium intake.  If you eat here regularly you would probably be lucky to make it into your 60's ... this is a special type of meal that should not be eaten regularly.. . The desserts... (yes we had to try them) were just so-so with the creme brulee getting the raves over the banana pie/cake and the pecan pie . . We had a couple of bottles of red wine between the 3 of us and it was priced with what is pretty much the standard 400% to 500% markup over what you would pay a Lee's liquor. . . Our total bill was a little over $280 plus a 20% tip which is surely shared with all the meat servers.. . Location at Town Square makes for easy parking, easy access off the freeways or Las Vegas blvd.. . We had a reservation for 5:15pm and arrived about 5:05 were seated by 5:15.  The place was already starting to fill up.  It is a big place and seemed pretty full by around 7:00pm.  It is a little loud but no problem at all having conversation with our old friend.
Ehhhh...  Meats were good. Salad bar is alright for what it is. Don't really know what to expect if you haven't been here before. And I hadn't been. Not too impressed but it was good. Three stats due to one incident with the bully style waitress. 4 stars if she was not such a biatch about sharing a piece of meat!!
Oh my lord. I cannot praise this place enough. . . I came to Texas de Brazil with friends on a recommendation, and I paused midway through dinner to text and thank that person profusely for the rec. GAHHHH it's so good! Walking into the restaurant was already a good start, as the decor and set up were really nice. We were seated almost immediately which was very nice considering we were all ravenous. We were greeted with an amazing looking salad/app bar and holy crap, I did not know where to start. My friends and I all chose the full meal selection (includes meat as well as salad bar), but you also have the option of doing the salad bar only for a slightly lower price. . . Just the salad bar alone was incredible, and my plate was stacked with food before even getting to the meat. My friend who is a bit of a health freak went crazy over the salad bar and thought everything she tried was delicious and really well-seasoned. I really enjoyed everything from the bar as well. I'd recommend the smoked salmon, caprese salad, and bell peppers. SO good. Also, the cheese bread they bring to the table is quite tasty :). . The meat at Texas de Brazil is fantastic. For me, the BBQ pork ribs and sirloin steak stood out the most. Both were well-seasoned and just melted in my mouth. My friends loved the meat and I'm pretty sure we were all having a foodgasm at some point haha. The fact that you can eat all the meat that you want is incredible. Not exactly cheap ($50/person for full dinner) but worth every penny IMO, especially considering how much we all ate. Servers were nice and accommodating, giving my friend any dessert piece she wanted since we were celebrating her birthday :) if you like incredibly attentive service then you might not find that here, because we did not see our waitress very often and had to look around and wait a bit to order drinks or request for something, but we had a grand time eating and talking so it really didn't bother us. However, the servers that were carving the meat did come by frequently so that was a plus :). . Their sangria was delicious. Probably the best that I've tried and would go back just for that aha. And the mashed potatoes and caramelized cinnamon bananas that they bring are a nice touch. Both really good.. . All in all, if you're in Vegas and looking for a nice place to go to dinner, I would highly recommend going to Texas de Brazil if you don't mind the price point. Because after sitting down, you will most likely be getting the full dinner option if that was not your original decision already ;) The meat, food and drinks we had were just delicious and we had a really nice time there. I can't recommend this place enough. Just do it, I highly doubt you'll regret it :)
Had reservations for 9:30, still have not gotten a table yet and its 10 now. This is amateur hour......bbye
