I was trying to plan a vacation, and stay here. I called asked for a nice room, was told since I don't have a players card with them I was only allowed to have a standard room. I remember coming here for over 30 years, I never have thought, I would be told I can't stay at a hotel. Thank You Rhonda! Your service on the phone made it clear I can't stay here. What Great Customer Service! Zero star if I could.
Circus .......Circus.. A place for all age groups. Wait time is approx. 20 mins, they don't repeat the same again n again.. The perform different kinds of entertainment everytime.
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #8:. well, the super-creepy leering clown neon sign out front sets the stage for this joint; I suppose my advice to you before you come here is to gain 40 or so pounds, go clothes shopping at WalMart, and have 2 to 4 rugrats to drag along; if not, Circus Circus has plenty of low-end eateries to pack on the pounds, low-end touristy shops for the wardrobe, and I believe they even rent out loud & hyperactive children if you don't have any of your own; OK, I'll quit being mean now...; the place is surprisingly large; there's a strange separated annex building with more slot machines; a 2nd floor of low-end shops & eateries surrounds a humongous amusement area that I am sure most 4 to 10 year olds would love; best craft brew bet = shockingly, the Circus Spirits store has some decent craft 22 oz. bombers, including Tenaya Creek, at very reasonable prices
I just stayed here again (Casino Tower) and I was very happy with my stay as i had been the last few times i 've stayed. I do not have any problems at this hotel and I find the Casino Tower rooms to be my favorite. I plan on continuing to stay here.. . Parking can be an ordeal as ths hotel is very busy and check in lines can be long but they have many agent windows open (more than other hotels) so the line will go down much quicker.
This place was built into the 60's and it shows. The whole place smells like Lysol because they've used so much of it over the years. The rooms are really cheap for a reason, they are old and basic. This place attracts low end clientele and families with lots of kids. It's filled to the brim with super cheap souvenir stores and gimmicky shops.  If you are desperate, this place will do in a pinch. But, avoid it if you can. Ironically, they have the best steakhouse in town (seriously).
Circus circus is a bit beat up, but it is still fun to go to. The dinner buffet is pretty decent, but could use some work. It also gets pretty busy there and the crowds are ridiculous, but it is a fun place for families and anyone who wants to have a fun time! (:
Room was clean but that's as positive as I can be.  Very little water pressure in the shower.  Tiny soap bars. Only 2 towels.  No tv channels to speak of.  The casino and midway smelled horrible.  Very out dated will definitely go back to our regular spots on Fremont Street!
It was a last minute booking. We needed to stay close to the Wynn but didn't want to pay Wynn money. The stay was cheap. Do not stay anywhere other than one of the Towers. The Manors (or whatever they are called) are just motel styled meth labs. Not worth it. Cough up the extra 10$ and stay in a more decent room.
This hotel is definitely run down but it's also the cheapest hotel on the strip & was one of the first ones to be built. There's fun games for the kids on the lower floor. The service was fine. However, I would recommend staying somewhere towards the middle of the strip because this is far from everything else.
If you have kids Circus Circus is a decent idea otherwise do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. This place is run down and old and smells like mildew. . . I normally stay at The Quad so my expectations are not that high but circus circus still didn't meet them. We stayed at circus circus manor which is actually more of a cheap motel than a casino hotel. This place smells like mildew, the walls and ceiling are super thin, it is similar to a cheap apartment I used to live in. I can loudly hear the people up stairs walking across their room. I can hear conversations and tv from the people in the room next to me. . . Lastly the location is not great. It's a long walk to anything to the point where you are either taking a cab or walking 2 miles to get to anywhere interesting. If you have to drive or cab everywhere you might as well stay off the strip in somewhere nicer that is just as inexpensive. It's cheap for a reason.
If you win - you lost !! They wont pay your win !!! Service is unnessecary because nobody cares and service buttons mostly doesnt work.. staff is unfriendly and the old ladies who serve cocktails are just disgusting!!! Buuh...
People, stop booking the manor rooms and then complaining about them.  The west tower and casino tower rooms are fine - large and clean.  The hallways have a pleasant scent.  The casino was clean.  The Adventuredome was clean.  Sure there were kids walking with their parents (not in the gaming area) but none were unruly.  I saw worse kids at the grocery store yesterday.  There is security all over.  The bus stops immediately next door at Slots-A-Fun to head south or directly in front of Riviera across the street to go downtown.  Bus passes are $8.00 for 24 hours and we got four rides each out of them.  We have absolutely no complaints about our stay.
Circus Circus gets a bad rep but it's really not as scary or run down as everyone makes it seem. It's definitely not the Aria but for the prices, it's decent. The rooms were clean (except some towels that had suspicious stains on them but easily fixed with an exchange from the maid cart) and the Westside Manor isn't as fancy but you pay for what you get. My friend and I made a last minute trip to Vegas for a concert and this was in our budget, close, and relatively safe.
The show in the Midway was great. Loved the.clown and loved Oksana the ballerina who hung from the ropes
