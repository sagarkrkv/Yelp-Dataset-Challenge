Awesome vibe .. Brian tick is the promoter you want to get a hold of !!! He will make sure u have a great experience and he has great advice !!!! Thanks brain Tickes
I haven't been here for the day club but I've been here twice for the night club. This is one of my favorite clubs in Vegas and should be on everyone's Vegas clubbing line-up.. . Getting into Marquee was confusing. They have about 6 flights of stairs and for us girls in heels, this was a huge no-no. There is an elevator in here... but I have no idea where the elevator started because it was no where near the entrance. . . There are three rooms and an outside pool lounge. I've only been to the pool lounge and the EDM room but they were both super fun and the music was great. The dance floor is big and they book big name artists. I saw Kaskade and Armin Van Buuren here. Love the atmosphere and the decor, and the servers/people who work here are very accommodating and nice. Overall, there is no way you wouldn't have fun here. But if you're a girl, bring some flats or something because those stairs are killer!
Ok, where do I start?. Who designed this place? The main dance floor is the size of an average 1bd apartment. Then you have several tables around, but you cannot touch them, even if you arePUSHED into them (what happens really often, since 50 people can make that dance floor crowded). EXTREMELY RUDE STAFF (except to the nice girl at the bar outside). The security guy decided to move those lines that separate the dance floor from the tables CLOSER to the crowd, even though there was a WALL right BEHIND IT and - of course - the crowd would push the damn thing back into the wall anyway. WHAT IS THE POINT OF PUSHING EVERYBODY AGAINST EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO HAVE ONE FOOT OF ROOM TO NOBODY? . I see many people here complaining about stairs... This is a one star review and I even took the elevator up. It's further ahead from the entrance that says Marquee in front of the bar in the main floor.. The crowd was so bad, pushing around, rubbing their dicks into girls when we would be pushed to each other like sardines.. But then it comes the worst part.... At 3 in the morning they closed a part of the outside. Then at 3:15 they started pushing everybody towards the inside because, apparently "they need to get people pumping inside" HOW? THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO ROOM THERE. Ok... Then we decided to stay right next to the outside bar, just to find out that if we wanted to go to the restrooms, we would have to stay inside.. Terrible TERRIBLE experience. Make yourselves a favor and go to LIFE, at SLS, where you actually have SPACE to dance.
I've been to Marquee several times.  Every time I leave, I get the same feeling. It was alright. Marquee is often packed. Both, the EDM main stage and the hiphop small stage down stairs are jammed packed. The lights and stage are decent, but nothing special. There's a floor with pool tables and lounges, but its reserved for VIP. . . Stairs. Flights of stairs everywhere. Its just that's what it is.
I was violated and abused by security at this club. They dumped all of my things in the pool.  They took my hearing device so I could not hear them and refused to let me have it back. They then arrested me for trespassing even though I couldnt comply with what they were asking from me because I could not hear them. No matter times I pleaded for my hearing device so a I could hear a reason for why I was being held in the office with handcuffs but they refused. I was treated very unfairly and will be getting a lawyer. I have several marks on me and I really hope I can put a stop to the way the security treats there customers.
Don't. Waste. Your. Time. (or your money). . The staff is friendly and all, but it's Vegas.  That much is to be expected.  Sadly, the Cosmopolitan's "toptional" pool fails to live up to any other expectation you might have.  Toptional is their word... it basically means that female guests can take off their tops, but only while they stay confined to their daybeds.  They waited until my wife went for a dip in the pool before explaining the restrictions, she was not amused.  Despite the younger crowd, this is a boring place where you can go if you want to pay for the privilege of sitting down.  ALL the seating comes with a steep food and drink minimum, no matter how dead it is.  You won't have trouble meeting the minimum, though, thanks to the watery and expensive drinks. . . They almost earned a second star because some of the food is actually pretty good (and their kitchen stays open a little later than the other pool's), the music is nice, and the layout has a lot of potential if you bring a big group top liven it up.  And it is a nice place to take a nap once your do order a few drinks.   But I was hoping for something much livelier, and I was hoping that Vegas' initial lunges for my wallet would be a little more subtle than this, so no.
Ok,so first trip to Vegas AND it's our honeymoon! I wanted to live it up and get good taste of the Vegas experience! Who knew Vegas was so conservative! . . My husband and I came to Marquee specifically for the "toptional" aspect. I don't get a chance to go topless often, so this was a major draw. When we got there we were told that unless we wanted to sit at the bar we would have to pay a food and beverage minimum, $100 for 2 chairs up to $1000 for a cabana complete with it's own infinity pool. . . Since we planned on spending the day there, we opted for 2 chairs. Most pitchers of mixed drinks were $75, (up to $150) steep but good. I have to say if you're going to do that, the Margarita is the most potent, choose wisely :). . The day we went was a Tuesday, so no cover, which was nice, but not many people were there. My top was the only one off all day, and I was only allowed to stay that way on my daybed. I had to put it back on to get in the pool or go to the bar.... . Overall, have to say waitstaff was pretty cool, drinks were good, but I really don't understand why I need to wear a top to get in the water, sorry.
I wish I can give this place a zero star. . . Marquee night club-HORRIBLE. Our group with 7 girls went there with a group of guys who reserved a table on 8/30 night. The door did not let us get in with the boys. The entrance fee was double that night from $20 to $40. So we all paid $40 to go in to have a good time. But when we got in, there were way too many people. We literally had to push people to walk. The security was mean and just kept yelling at us to "keep moving" when you did not know where to move to. Because it was too crowded, I decided to leave earlier. Then there were five-level of stairs that you have to climb to get out. I took off my heels because it's too painful. It's like you were going to limbo with endless stairs. I finally got to the ground level then I got yelled at the door by a guy to ask me to wear my shoes. EXCUSE ME! I was about to walk out from this place. Why you are yelling at me??? Overall experience: over pricy, SUPER RUDE staff and security, way too crowded. . Marquee day club: RUDE STAFF. My girlfriends got VIP passes so we decided to give marquee day club another try the next day on 8/31 because some girls heard good things. Most of my friends went around noon and got in with VIP passes. Me and another friend went later and arrived the door around 3:05 pm. We asked the door if we can get in with the VIP passes. The door guy went to talk to a bald guy who seems was the guy who was in charge the door. He then told us that the VIP pass was only good until 3 pm. We tried to tell them that we have 5 girlfriends were inside and we came here bc of the passes. We also asked him where it said on the pass that the entrance was only good till 3 pm bc i could not find it anywhere. The bald guy then said the pass actually ended at 2 pm instead of 3 pm. At this point, we were super confused. He then told us it is only $20 to get in and asked us to pay. He yelled at us saying "it's only $20. You cannot even pay $20. It is very cheap" The bald guy was super RUDE and OUTRAGEOUS. . Well! It's not about the money. that guy ruined our mood so we did not even want to go to this place anymore. We left the door to gamble. Overall experience: SUPER RUDE and SNOBBISH staff at the door!!!!
Labor Day Weekend 14' . . Marquee Nightclub: (2 stars) . . Music: Armin was the DJ of the night and since I am a huge fan of Armin there are no complaints on this aspect!. . Attendees:  In the words of Magic, Why do you gotta be so RUDE?!!!!. The nightclub was full of rude & inconsiderate people on Sunday night!  I was literally stuck in the front of the stage for more than 2 hours because no one would let me get out. I am not one to resort to violence but seriously people need to just calm down and move aside for people! I had a friend that went on Saturday for Kaskade and she said that it was just as bad if not worse! People need to remember that we are all there for the same reasons and that is to have fun and enjoy the music, so I hope people can learn to be more courteous!. . Security: Thank you for pulling me out of the crowd when no one would let me through & thanks for saving me from the creep that was harassing me !. . . Marquee Dayclub: ( 5 stars). . Music: I really like Tritional's singles, but this was my first time ever seeing Tritional live and I thought they were really good. Although they are not as big as Kaskade and Armin they still managed to put on a good show!. . Drinks: It was open bar for ladies so I took full advantage of it! Although all drinks were free from 1-2pm on Labor Day, remember to be courteous and tip the bartenders it just feels like the right thing to do. . . Security: Clumsy me managed to lose my wallet, but the head of security conducted everything in a professional manner and  eventually everything worked out because a kind soul turned in my wallet ! . . Attendees: Everyone seemed to be really chill and much more enjoyable to be around in comparison to those from the night before. . . . Final Verdict: I don't know if I would come back for nightclub ever again butdayclub is a automatic YES !
As this place has gotten less busy it has gotten a lot easier to get in. They put on a dang good party. Now the problem is that their just aren't enough people coming here so it isn't quite as packed with attractive people. But there are still a goodly amount!
** REVIEW FOR "Marquee Dayclub" ONLY **. . (3.5 stars). . My cousins and I came by on a Friday at around 11:30 p.m. When we arrived, it wasn't terribly crowded. The house DJ playing that day stuck to EDM, but had a bit of variety here and there.. . Venue itself isn't entirely large. I really wish they had more seating/standing space, especially more space for dancing. I'd highly suggest grabbing a table if you can.. . Bartenders are accommodating. Wished they could mix their frozen drinks a bit better.. Prices for drinks are typical, ranging a bit above $15. However, they give free, cold water. That's a winner in my book!. . Overall, it was a cool pool party. I just wished this venue was a bit bigger.
2.5 went a weekend with friends that go to vegas..and since they stayed at the cosmo they wanted to go so i figured I wont fight them (i go to vegas a lot) and let them see for themselves. (nightclub). Highs-. the music is good. . Lows-. overcrowded as hell. 1500 for a table which you can get a better deal at other clubs. . its not a bad club by any means nothing too great and nothing too bad  but I prefer Tao, The Bank etc
This is a good club.. . It's huge, with an inside, and an outside (both very big) and a few other rooms (only open on busy nights) and you get a really great view of the strip from certain parts. . . The music inside is EDM and the music outside is top 40's and hip hop. So there is something for everyone. . . Girls on the guest list get open bar. . . One complaint would be how packed it gets inside and how they don't allow you to stand in certain parts because of how much they pack the club. . . I also HATE THE EXIT-- They make you walk down about 7 flights of stairs. . . Picture this, groups of DRUNK girls, in Vegas, in HIGH HEELS, walking down 7 metal flights of stairs after a night of drinking and dancing. That is just MEAN. . . I really don't get why Marquee makes girls do this... Install some exit elevators like EVERY OTHER rooftop club in Vegas. So weird. Basically cruel. . . So if you decide to check out Marquee.... Bring some extra flats in your purse for exiting the club..
This club went downhill from the first time I went in 2012.  Overcrowded to the point you're constantly shoulder checked by someone, which in turn, gets you insanely hostile.  Forget about dancing since you'll never get into the dance floor past 12 AM because it's closed off.  Dare I say that it's about as good as Hakkasan and I reaaaaalllly despise that club.
One of the better dayclub options. Just don't go in the pool as our group of 5 all got sick the next day. And avoid the bottle rats. Pour them drinks without alcohol. I find it entertaining to watch them think they are getting drunk without alcohol.
The bouncer in charge at 1:30am was really discriminating on who will go in and who will be turned away. Horrible experience especially for POC.
I love this night club!! One of my favorite anywhere, but especially in Las Vegas!!. . Has an indoor and outdoor area with DJs. Marquee always brings in great DJs and performers. The dance area is always monitored and even though there are lots of people, you don't get crushed like at other clubs.. . Drinks are crazy expensive though...but where aren't they on the strip? . . Overall, just a really great club with several levels.
ONE WORD PROMOTOR! Message me for a promoter guys! They HOOK you up with everything, FREE GUEST-LIST for GUYS & GIRLS on a Saturday night on 9/6/14 to see KEVIN HART? Don't mind if we DO! 3 girls & 3 guys come before 12AM and there will be a short line and easy access to the club. Come after that and except a LONG LONG wait to get in the club. . . The club was pretty big compare to other clubs in vegas. The floor was jam packed, the DJ that night was Eric Dlux and hosted by Kevin Hart. There was an outside area too! Good if you wanted some fresh air! Though I suggest staying inside because that were the good DJs at! Plus they blast you with this air thingy you might not be able to see things for a couple a second and they're not cheap with those damn confetti! They hit you with that shit a couple of time LOL. Security was okay, they weren't so tight on it like checking your purse or patting you down, which is good. AMAZING view outside, great pools! . . Cons: FUHHHing took forever to get on those damn elevator, you have to wait in line to get in the line to get in the elevator to get up to the club. GROSS.... they try to fit so many people inside one elevator LOL & the worse part is everyone has to go down using stairs! Guys are whatever about it but GIRLS we wear friggin HIGH HEELS, trying to hurt our feet even more ahahahaha and while buzzed? No-No-No. I suggest you take off your heels or bring flats.
BRIAN TICKETS! Brian was such a huge part of my weekend. He's a promoter for the marquee and can also have you put on for other guest lists. I was more than accommodated and got in free to every place I wanted. He was great at communicating with me and responds quickly! The club itself is great as well! They cater to different kinds of music lovers ! A must visit while here in Vegas !
Nice venue , spacious and has a couple different rooms to meet your musical needs. Suggest getting bottle service here to make sure you have somewhere to sit since this place gets packed. The venue although pricey is money  well spent in comparison to some other popular venues in the city.
Ok so just for starters I am now 40 years old and a little removed from my nightclub days.  However my host got me into this place (I gamble a lot) so I sort of skipped the line and went in to this table service area where we had bottle service.  I loved the experience.  The DJ's were very energetic and played very good music all night.  When they bring out the champagne it is like a circus show with minor fireworks and girls dancing on top of a guy (just order a bottle of Dom and you will see).  Very good looking crowd.  I had a good time and would go back and have the table service.
If You Can Get On A Guestlist I Would Suggest That, If Not You Will Have To Pay. But I Went To The Marquee Day Club On Sunday 9/21/14 And Had An Awesome Time The DJ Set Was Great And The People Are Good looking And Fun...The Drinks Are Pretty Pricey, The Girl At The Bar Was A Bit Rude But Ill Let That Slide She Seemed A Little Busy And Irritated. All In All It Was A lot Of Fun. I Also Went To The Nightclub On Monday 9/22/14 And I Think That Was The Best, It Does Get Super Crowded But You Can Also Go Outside To The Pool Area, We Met Some Really Cool People And Got To Hang Out At Their Table And Have Some Drinks Everyone Was Friendly, Marquee is Deff The Hottest Club I Have Been Too And So Far My New Favorite. I Still Wanna Try Hakkassan Though So We Will See.
Benny Benassi was awesome over Labor Day weekend...... Wear good shoes......u will be standing all night.
The energetic, off-the-wall, and endlessly entertaining environment at Marquee Dayclub may have just been the most fun I've ever had between the hours of 11 AM - 5 PM: . . My girlfriend and I had Double Date wristbands for Kaskade's Summer Lovin' series - meaning that we had access to both the Dayclub and the Nightclub within the span of the same day. We really just can't get enough of Kaskade. . . The first of the two shows took place at Marquee Dayclub, where we had no problems at all as far as finding the correct line to check-in and claim our wristbands at. The girl who put our wristbands on even went so far as to cheerfully make sure that they weren't too tight on us - a gesture of kindness that I don't witness too often in the clubbing scene.. . I've learned some handy tips for those not familiar with Marquee Dayclub: . . - I'd advise getting to Marquee Dayclub early - that's your best bet for getting a pool towel to use. That towel, in turn, will allow you to stake your claim somewhere near the pool area (assuming you don't have a chair/cabana on deck, of course). We had little trouble getting a great spot near the main Dayclub pool, being that we arrived at around 12:30 PM or so. This being said, we may have arrived at this day party a bit too early - Kaskade didnt come on until almost three-and-a-half hours after we arrived (although Amtrac had the party rocking all day long!).. . - Free water is provided for on both sides of the bar towards the back of the venue, behind the DJ decks. It's got hints of cucumber and is consistently nice and chilled (and never empty), so you've simply got no excuse for paying for bottles of Voss water otherthan for the sake of looking bougey. . . - There are blackjack tables at the ready, all prepped to take advantage of drunken passerby. My advice - don't be that guy. I didn't see a single soul walk away from that table with any look on his face (only the fellas bought the bait) other than that of complete and utter defeat. . . One rather sketchy transaction took place after the lady and I bought a Daiquiri from the bar stationed at the back of the Dayclub. My girlfriend paid with a $100 bill, and it was a good thing I went through the trouble of counting our change back - our bartender shorted us on change by twenty bucks! You would think that it's a common practice for someone working in food/beverage service to count cash back for a customer (especially with larger denominations), but this server made no effort at all to do so. Of course, after her mistake was identified, our bikini-clad bartender was happy to correct things ("Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetie!"), but I was still suspicious. Frankly, I wouldn't have been surprised if she would've contested this claim, had we not caught it right then and there. . . On the flip side of things, the overall vibe of Marquee Dayclub is laidback, sexy, and irresistibly fun. For me, dayclubbing doesn't exude as much of a pretentious sort of vibe as nightclubbing does, and this was certainly echoed at Marquee. From the group of Asian girls proudly parading around with a massive Kaskade cutout head (which they were repeatedly lending out to other groups of attendees for photo ops!), to the group of gay guys that couldn't stop complimenting my girlfriend and I on how great we looked with one another, the place was filled with folks who just wanted to have fun and take in the experience of a complete departure from the real world. . . Coolest of all were the lucky partiers who had booked VIP cabanas that day; in addition to spraying the crowd with bottle upon bottle of Cliquot (we're talking like a college tuition's worth in champagne here, folks), the dayclubbers in one premium cabana kept providing my girl and I with free Heinekens - all in all, I must have anywhere from $30-40 thanks to their generosity! I felt like I was on the set of an episode of "Entourage," or something to that effect. Needless to say, the crowd at Marquee Dayclub made the "Summer Lovin'" feeling seem all the more real for us. . . Speaking of, Kaskade himself delivered a set that was perfectly geared for a hot Las Vegas day. While it wasn't as diverse as his Marquee Nightclub set later that night (review coming soon!), I nonetheless enjoyed his mix of melodic build-ups and electro house breakdowns. Per usual, everyone's favorite funky Mormon DJ exceeded expectations. . . Needless to say, Marquee Dayclub was a bit of a departure of the norm for me. The Dayclub bug has bitten me, and I'm downright addicted.  . . (After a quick power nap, and with hangovers still in tow, my girlfriend and I made our way to Marquee Nightclub later that evening...but it looks like I'll just have to fill you all in on that next time!)
If I can give this place a zero, I would. Completely overrated, and the crew running the front were just plain rude. Not worth the time or money.
