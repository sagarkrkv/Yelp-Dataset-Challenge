I was weary because of the sensual side to it, but this is easily one of my favorite Cirque shows. You have to go in expecting anything, but the side and in-between acts were funny, and the acrobatic talent was amazing. There was a good mix of different acts and even if you've seen most Cirque shows, this one certainly won't bore you. I really liked the crowd involvement. The theatre itself is unique as well!
I would describe this as a a So You Think You Can Dance/Burlesque show... not enough Cirque.. . The pros are it has a few very stunning silk acts and a great pole balance act. The hosts are very funny.. . The cons are just not enough cirque acts and no real story, more like a variety show. It was worth seeing at the dress rehearsal price but I wouldn't want to play full price.
Absolutely stunning!!  We spent the $300 for the couch seats last night. I don't know what else everyone is complaining about on here. I've see all the cirque shows and this by far is the best one. All natural women and smoking hot men-especially the one with the pink Mohawk!!!!!!! YUMO!!! Go see it!!!
Great Great Great Show. Must watch. The acts and the message it brings to the public is something to really live by. Grab one of the big drinks from the front and just enjoy the 1.5 hr show. It is definitely a must see!!!!
Sorry but we have been to a few Vegas shows like Le Dream, Jersey Boys and a few others, but for money we paid out it just wasn't worth it, they should of had more acts more action, I could have gone to a strip joint and paid less
Pretty fun! Not for everyone, but if you have a sense of humor or just like to watch... this was entertaining. Drinking helps. The preshow is a lot of fun too. Comfortable seats and great theater, you pay for how close you want to be.. . If you are not shy go for a front row seat or the couches.. Probably get your best prices at NY NY with whatever deal they have, although Travelzoo did have a deal we used in spite of not being Travelzoo fans. (Travelzoo can be pretty erratic and they are NO help if you get into it with the vendor. You bought it, you own it.) We sat up on the front sides and you sure are CLOSE, but you miss a little of the front stage action and maybe some of the perspective of the higher acts.. . Some Excellent acrobatics and moderated fauxsexual scenes, moderator host was excellent.
Sensual and risque routines showcasing truly talented performers. Includes dance routines and more typical Cirque moves. Had some comedy and audience participation mixed in too!  Explores the spectrum of sexuality and includes lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, orgy, drag and s&m aspects.  Come with an open mind or you may be uncomfortable. I was 100% entertained.
We loved this show and thought it was fabulous. It was erotic, humorous, and very visually entertaining. It is definitely for adults only. Try to see it with someone you love. If you are offended by sexual material, do not go to see it. I would go back and see it again for sure.
I went to a Zumanity dress rehearsal that I got discounted tickets for through my company. While I thought it was entertaining at times, I felt that it was a bit all over the place. The only real common theme was topless dancing...? Definitely not the best burlesque or Cirque show I've been too.. . There were a few standout performances,  specifically our Mistress of Ceremonies, and the "Breakfast at Tiffany's" scene. The bondage acrobatics scene was also really good. Many of the costumes were beautiful. As a whole, I'm glad that I didn't pay full price, but I did enjoy myself. . . All in all, if you can get discounted tickets, I would say go for it, but if not, then try one of the other Cirque shows
