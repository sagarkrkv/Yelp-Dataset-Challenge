Other than the clown element, I really enjoyed O.  Fire, water, and acrobatics all made for an enjoyable performance.  However, if there was a story, I had no idea what it was.  But to be fair, we sat in the VIP suites at the back of the theater.  Private suites that seat four (although we had only two in our party) with a bottle of champagne, chocolate-covered strawberries and truffles.  So I probably spent more time counting how many chocolates my husband was taking over his 50% than paying attention.. . The private entrance came in handy when my husband claimed he set an alarm for 6 pm and yet I woke up at 7:10 wondering why I was so well-rested.  After the fastest costume change ever, we literally ran to the theater and arrived just after it started, but did not disturb anyone.  The cocktail server whisked in just behind us to open the champagne.  I was miffed at my husband for missing the chance to get our photo, but a photographer came to our suite before I had a chance to start bitching.  . . Sadly, the $335 per ticket price did not include a photo, which I looked hideous in, but yet I still felt compelled to buy both for $90 so I could study at my leisure which one was less ghastly.  I am just grateful he told me to pose in such a way to hide the arm fat.  I later got an email that I could buy a digital download which I would have rather done to begin with so I could work my wonders with Photoshop.  So before you buy a photo with the stupid album you might not want anyway, ask if you can just fill out the card with your email address for the download.  . . I probably wouldn't see O again, but I thought it was a great show and really enjoyed the suite!
Aunque conozcas Cirque su Soleil, "O" es absolutamente espectacular, el juego de agua y el escenario lo hacen sorprendente. . Si vienes a las Vegas debes conocerlo
Enjoyed my first viewing of "O" tonight. Certainly one of the best Cirque du Soleil productions and one of the best shows on the Strip, and also a special night for me.. . I was lucky enough to enjoy VIP seating. My +1 and I did have to stand in line at the ticket booth and in line to get through the doors, but we were attended to quite well when we entered the theater. They showed us to our private VIP seating area, which we ended up sharing with two other VIPs (four per booth). Did I mention VIP? OK, good!. . One of the employees presented our wine bottle corresponding to our previously selected red wine. It was a delicious Faust Cabernet Sauvignon 2011 (the ticket said 2010, but I'll forgive them), one of the best wines I've enjoyed in my admittedly limited experience. They let my +1 taste it and then poured when we were satisfied. Afterward, we got to enjoy the entire bottle, even to the point that they provided, without asking, plastic cups for us to enjoy the rest of the contents of the bottle after the show. Damn, I'm glad that I wore something decent instead of the usual shorts and T-shirt.. . They also had a nice selection of chocolates for us to enjoy, (Look, I know you probably want me to talk about the show itself, but there's plenty of reviews about those, and not a lot of reviews that say "VIP," so just indulge me for another paragraph.) For each pair of VIPs, were two chocolate-covered strawberries and four chocolate truffles (hazelnut, dark chocolate, mint chocolate, and some unknown fruit). The strawberries were delicious, as were their chocolate coverings, and the truffles had really great chocolate with flavorful creamy fillings. I actually have no idea what I was thinking when I declined the employee's post-show offer to shower us with more chocolate. I am sure that I would have enjoyed them as much as I did the first time.. . So, the show. Lots of great live music. Creative use of the water, the rising and falling stage floor, the backdrops, and all the suspended props and apparatuses. Great acrobatics, strength, twirling, and contortion acts. My favorites were what I call the "pendulum airship" and some of the fire spinners. The acts were interspersed with performances from the clowns, who of course are funny. Also enjoyed the supporting actors and performers (including some audience plants, although lucky real audience members do get to participate too) who move the play along and provide lively background.. . There is often so much to pay attention to that you'll miss things, so there will be plenty to see if you return for another viewing. On a VIP seating note, we had seats in the "Loggia 200" area, above the very outer edge of the lower bowl, and while it was harder to see details of costume and facial expressions and whatnot, I thought that it was easier to keep all the action in line of sight than if we had been sitting a lot closer. I really wonder how people with balcony (nosebleed) seating handled their circumstance. One more VIP note: it's surprisingly a lot more relaxing when you can stretch and lean forward and wave your arms around without worrying about obstructing other people's line of sight.. . Coming in to this, I had in mind a previous show that I've also seen once. This is a different animal than Le Reve, which is a non-Cirque production. I think both shows make great use of their performers and their space. There is a lot of vertical and horizontal space utilization in both. You can say that both have good music, dancing, comedy, and lots of water usage. If I had to choose just one, I would probably take a long time to think about it and choose "O" in the end, but you should check both out if you get the chance.
Best Cirque Du Soleil show in Las Vegas!. . If you are deciding on a show to see in Las Vegas you cannot go wrong with O. Put simply, go see it! It's close to impossible to be disappointed with this masterpiece.. . O on paper and by word of mouth  throughout the local Las Vegas community is rated one of the best shows to ever hit the strip and 2 minutes into it you will see why.. Acrobatics, synchronize swimming, pyrotechnics, diving  and comedy are parts of the show that will leave you amazed. . . Without throwing spoilers into this review I will say you will see a character in a bathtub rowing across a pool and blowing fire. Now if that doesn't get wanting to see more I don't know what else will.. . The best new seats in the house are the new VIP balcony booths. I highly recommend getting this as you will have your own wait staff, drinks and something to nibble throughout the show. The views are  also incredible.. . The show is just under 2hrs long so make sure you have either eaten or gone to the bathroom before as it's a thrill a second. I can't say enough without spoiling it. Highly recommended.. . Overall. Drinks: 5-5. Service: 5-5. Entertainment value: 5-5. See it again: Yes in a heart beat
I don't get it. I really don't. What is all the hype about with this show?. . O is considered to be one of the top shows in Vegas but I found it to be the worst show I've seen so far. And I've seen about a dozen shows in Vegas.. . Granted, the stage is amazing but the show itself is terribly boring. It mainly consists of glorified synchronized swimming and diving, 2 sports I avoid watching during the Summer Olympics. So why should I pay $150 a ticket to watch it live?. . There was an act where a half dozen performers swung around on some wire grid in and took turns diving into the water. After they were done, they posed and waited for applause. For what, I have absolutely no clue. Anyone could have done what they did.. . Even the clowns weren't funny. All of their jokes were painfully obvious.. . I had never been as bored in a show as much as I was in O and considering its high price tags, I was very disappointed. If you're looking for a Cirque show in Vegas,One, Mystere and Ka are all better by far.. . O may have been amazing when it opened about 15 years ago but now it lacks any kind of creativity, energy and awe factor. It was a giant waste of time.
I wished Bellagio had an electroshock therapy vendor to administer temporary memory loss.  That way I could forget about every other Cirque show I've seen and "O" would blow my mind like it did the first time I saw it in 2002.  Sign me up and please hand me that rubber thing that stops me from biting my tongue.. . The writer and director of the show, Franco Dragone, is freakin brilliant!  How in the world does one conceptualize a show like this and then explain to others how it's all supposed to work without being shoved into a windowless van with a one way trip to the funny farm?  I can only imagine the conversations he had before it got the green light:. . . Dragone: "So honey, it'll be a stage that will change from a big assed pool with 1.5 million gallons of water and back into a dry stage that can be walked on  throughout the show.  And then there will be a ton of synchronized swimmers and the theatre is going to look like a 14th century opera house.  I was thinking during dinner last night that there should be a guy in the show that will set himself on fire.". . Mrs. Dragone: "Yes, dear. (rolls eyes)  Don't forget to mow the lawn tomorrow.  We have company this weekend."    . . . Later in the day..... . . Dragone: "Aerialists! Clowns! Contortionists! Trapeze! People on a Russian swing and swimmers everywhere!  Sometimes it will all happen at the same time!  Lots of leotards too!". . Dragone's ex-college roommate: "Yeah, yeah.  Sounds sweet.  Pass the bong already.". . . Sure, there are detractors that say it's too pretentious and artsy fartsy.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  After all these years, "O" is still inspiring, a welcome escape from reality, and a "can't miss" show in town.
'O' my heavens!. . With many of the Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas, O rises to the occasion with an amazing show.  The setup is similar to the others in town with many different talents showcased for enthused audiences.  With the water aspect being the center theme, it opens up a multitude of stage variations.  One moment it is a solid stage... then next it's an open pool of water.  Incredible to see!. . I was given the opportunity to experience the new VIP suites.  Pretty incredible with a perfect view.  Chocolate covered strawberries and truffles are waiting for you!  You have a waitress there to assist the entire evening.  She is there for any drink or food orders.  She was so polite and friendly.  Her service was impeccable! . . O is definitely one of my favorites and would love to see it again!
Outstanding show, opulent theater, outrageously talented performers: that's O!. I've been wanting to see this show since my first visit to Vegas and the wait was well worth it. Show itself was amazing, the characters and scenes made me think of a Dali panting brought to life. . . As at other Cirque shows, there is little to no story line- this show seems to be more of a dreamlike world and I enjoyed the mostly instrumental music. . The introductory scene is always a can't-miss moment: from the oddball characters interacting with the audience prior to start, to the way the opaque red curtains are removed to show the unique stage. The various stage transitionswere by far the most unique aspect of this show specifically- I now have much more respect for my former college roommate, who was a synchronized swimmer.. . Favorite performances were the girl balanced on her head (you'll know her when you see her), the endless ladder going up to the ceiling, and the black-and-white-striped dancers with the metal rack- think Jabbawockeez on steroids, in midair, over water.. . If you ever have the opportunity to see this show with VIP tickets, it is quite a luxe experience with a great view that allows you to see the entire stage without the constant neck-swiveling to make sure you don't miss anything.
I'm a Cirque du Soleil fan. They make everything seem so easy. The core strength of the performers is just remarkable and awe-inspiring. . . The first time I watched "O" was 10 years ago with my little cousin - we were sitting in front and center. It's a wholesome show and safe to watch with kids. I still have the music CD to this show. I got to watch it again on date night. VIP tickets include seats to the VIP suite, bottle service, chocolate bon bons and chocolate covered strawberries - which made the experience more exquisite. Nothing has really changed since the first time I've seen "O". . This show involves clowns that won't scare/annoy you, zebras, live music, whips, boats, unicycles, carousel horses, synchronized swimming, trapeze, ladders, fire and dream-like elements. There were a few hiccups during the performance which the boyfriend found amusing since you don't see that all the time.. . One of these days when my core is as solid as a rock and bones removed from my body, I'll join CdS. They make yoga look like child's play.
Love.. Check.. Ka.... Check.. Mystere.... Check.. Zarkana... Check.. "O"... I can now check this one of my Cirque du Soleil list! . . This particular Cirque show was simply O-utstanding!  If you're stuck trying to decided between the slew of Cirque options in Vegas.....I would suggest you see "O" or Love - they're tied for my top spot. I do feel that Love offers more pizzazz  in the acrobatic realm. However, "O"  delivers an elegant and artistically refined performance that will not disappoint. . . The focus of this aquatic themed show is the breathtaking aerial acrobatics, synchronized swimming, spectacular diving, and a bit of humor. As other reviewers have stated, the stage seamlessly transitions from a pool to a solid surface throughout the performance. It is quite magical. There is so much to see during the performance that you won't know what to look at. The showmanship of the performers is breathtaking!. . Go ahead and Treat-Yo-Self to this show. It's worth it. It's Vegas. You'll love it.
The only Cirque show I had seen before was KA, and that was really good. The O show was very impressive as well. The different is that (besides O is water themed) is that O doesn't try to tell a story with the performances, and the stunts while impressive and expertly choreographed, I just think KA was slightly better.. . O stage is really impressive, many moving parts to the "pool" platform, and lots of crazy dives and acrobatics. Highly recommended, too. Limited view seating starts at 120$ and are actually pretty good seats. I dont think there was really any "bad" seats. Even limited view seating which starts at $120 is worth it.. . Tix4Tonight usually won't have O, so you need togo to the Bellagio directly.
