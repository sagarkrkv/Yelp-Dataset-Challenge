An awesome blend of athleticism, beauty and danger set in a fantastical world that stimulates your senses visually, musically and in touch.  Not sure how it compares to Cirque de Solel, as I have not seen one before, but the show was definitely worth the price of the tickets.  Skip the VIP seats and go for a section in the middle rows.  You will definitely get wet in the "splash zone".  I also recommend getting pairing your tickets with the optional Wynn's buffet dinner, called "The Buffet", for an additional fifteen dollars per person.
Le Re've is probably my favorite show in Vegas. The view is good no matter where you sit, and the whole show is breathtakingly beautiful.. . There is a circular stage in the middle immersed in water, and the audience sits around the stage. The performers enter and exit from the water and the ceiling, and the moves the pull off are simply amazing!. . Biggest props are definitely to whoever choreographed/designed the show. They definitely went all out with their imagination but were still able to create it in real life.. . This show is definitely on the pricier side, but, as cliche as it sounds, it's worth every penny.
Le Reve is a show with great acrobatics, impressive synchronized swimming and dancers with flair.  However; the story is weak and the music mostly uninspiring.  I almost preferred the parts that did not revolve around the main female character.  It was hard to follow the lovely couple dancing to the sudden change of rock music with demons....then random screaming and angels flying or dropping with high dives.  There were also sudden scenes with disco music and tables in the sky. If the theme was love is risky or everyone has to deal with temptations then I guess I kinda get it. Luckily, these tickets were comp'd.... . I was definitely entertained and the dancers were truly talented, but the story was downright laughable at times.  There was a dancing tantrum in the water and a silly bed scene. The high point was the ending which was actually visually awe-inspiring!  If I paid for this I likely would have been very disappointed, but all in all it was a good show.  The theater is strikingly beautiful and as many have said there are no bad seats!
A very unique show that must be watched! Amazing performance and staging effects!! We got the cheapest seats which were in the front, second row.. Best seats to be honest.. Got a couple drops but no big deal. The front got a little more splashed.. Hehe. Good seats anywhere really but why pay more than you have to, ay! Music and lighting really complimented the performance which was throughout the entire show. There was a storyline to the show but I couldn't pick it up.The shows duration was just enough but there were a few sections where ti was a bit long and repetitive but still glad to have experience thus spectacular show! Bonus thing was that non flash photos are permitted!! So don't forget your GoPros :)
I thought this show was another Cirque production ... see one, see them all. However, a friend said I really should see it cause it will be more than I expected. True! Thoroughly enjoyed it. . . I let the ticket reservationist chose the seats for me. She did good. Performers went up and down the stairs near the aisle seat. There was activity near the seat. The whole production was colorful, beautiful and fantastic.
I have watched some of Cirque du Soleil shows at Vegas. But Le Reve - The dream is slight different form others.  . . The show performs at Wynn Theater, every seat is a good seat coz seated around the stage.. . It goes with acrobatics on water, dance, magic all in one!  It's fantastic show and I got captivated from the beginning and few scenes so romance.. . If I never see any other Cirque du Soleil shows, it's the best show at Vegas!
I hate to give this beautiful show 2 stars, but I felt that it was very unorganized. There were barely any acrobatics, and the flow of the show made no sense. After having been to at least 5+ Cirque du Soleil shows, I thought that this one was extremely sub-par (it's not a Cirque show).. . The music and fog are great, but there is a significant lack of theme, acrobatics, and special effects. The view from most seats are great, unlike Cirque shows, but there just isn't much to see. The romance theme didn't make any sense, as it jumped from the couple to groups of people, then back to the woman with the rose. . . If you have limited time in Vegas to see a show, you can pass on this and won't regret it.
