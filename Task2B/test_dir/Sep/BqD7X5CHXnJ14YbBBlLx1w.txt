We hit happy hour 4-5:30. Got the dates, calamari, choriZo & tuna. The calamari was the best we have ever had so ordered another one! The happy hour sangria was delicious :) typically happy hour drink is 5-6 and tapas are 6.50.
This establishment gets a solid 3.5 starts. I came here on my trip to Vegas with my boyfriend. I was excited to try all the different tapas. While some of them were delicious, they were not as amazing as I would of liked them to be! The drinks were creative and delicious though.. . We got the: Spanish Iberico Sliders, Traditional Spanish Chicken Croquetas, Coca Vegetarian, Atlantic Salmon, and Flan! All were delicious, but not out of this world! I wish all the dishes had better flavors. . . Overall, really noisy ambiance, mediocre food, and okay service - I will probably not return on my next trip to Vegas!
So get my money on time, if they not money, decline. I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind. Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?. Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that at...JULIAN SERRANO! - Iggy Azalea (fancy). . I would normally never intentionally wait 40 mins for a paella in Vegas (where time is money). Since it was Labor Day weekend, we had more time and because I've walked by this place so many times, we finally decided to try this place for a late lunch. Most of the tapas were strong in flavor, including the steak, but the seafood paella stole the show. The lobster, clams, mussels, and shrimp all blended in together and its a dish we would never be able to replicate correctly at home so bravo! Dessert was also yummy.. . I'd recommend a paella and 2-3 tapas a person and you're good to go for a pleasant dining experience!
The restaurant is beautiful, service is good, the food is presented beautifully. We got the baby back ribs, White Sea bass, pan manchego, and stuffed dates. While the food looked delicious, the vast majority lacked substantial flavor- something tapas demands. When you charge as much as this restaurant does for tapas, I expected small plates packing a huge punch of flavor. My baby back ribs tasted almost freezer burnt with this somewhat too sweet sauce. The ribs were plated over marble potatoes which were bland themselves. My pan manchego was tasty but I think it'd be hard to screw up bread, tomatoes, and cheese. My husband did enjoy his stuffed dates which I found too sweet. He felt his bass was overcooked. Overall, very disappointing, overpriced meal.
Tapas 101:. . A glass of wine, a plate of tapas.. A glass of wine, a plate of tapas.. A glass of wine, a plate of tapas.. Repeat until full.. Siesta.. . Don't  be intimidated by the almost 100 selection menu.  . . Don't order more than one plate at a time (this isn't dim sum).. . Do take your time.  Savor the flavor of simply prepared, quality ingredients.. . While the kitchen excels at traditional tapas, do not pass the  tuna-raspberry skewer.  A multi sensory dish opening with the aroma of sesame and essence of raspberry, textural contrast of the silky cube of ahi against the seeds, the contrasting temperature of ingredients.  It just works.. . To the traditional.  Top props to the monkfish and pisto.  Beautifully pan seared, moist monkfish paired with a mix of eggplant, zucchini and tomato.  Vinegar adds a good acidic zing that brightens the flavor of the fish.  Excellent mixed seafood ceviche with perfectly "cooked" shrimp, white fish and octopus bathed in lime and cilantro.  Other standouts, gambas a la plancha (prepared head on; oh the head fat..), tender octopus whose oceanic flavor is heightened by the earthy paprika, calamari a la plancha simply dressed in olive oil, and a very simple plate o anchovy fillets.  . . Not into seafood?  Excellent rabo de toro (braised oxtail), falling off the bone, served with Iberian pork atop a very creamy, mashed potato, an excellent Iberian pork shoulder with it's deep, porky flavor, and a sublime plate of imported pata negra (ham from the black footed pig).  The hazelnuts of the pig's diet is very prominent in the complex flavor of the ham.. . Many repeat visits.  Service is consistently excellent; friendly and accommodating.  . . Very good wine list with well focused selection by the glass that pair well with the dishes.  Vegas resport pricing.. . Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....
Excellent Tapas + Great drinks = GOOD TIMES!. . Went to Julian Serrano in July party of 4.. . My wife has severe food allergies so although we are self proclaimed "foodies" it is always difficult or down right scary for us to try new places but as soon as we arrived and explained the allergies to our server, we were assured that they will prepare everything for our table to make sure there is no cross contamination.. . we ordered a bunch of tapas form the menu including,  spanish iberico sliders 9/10, the meatballs 8/10, the pan tomate 10/10, patats bravas 7/10 and the "Bomba" 9/10 which are these bad boys here in the picture!. . BTW Yelp guys! the Menu on this page is currently linking to the wrong restaurant!. . Washed it all down with a pitcher of sangria which was a little too sweet for me but good nonetheless. Everything was very fresh and of the highest quality. we enjoyed our meal and the staff was very nice and helpful. . . We will definitely be back to try more of their menu offerings which could make my rating from 4/5 to a 5/5!
Came here this past weekend after being buffet-ed out in Vegas and wanted a bit more refined dining.  There was no wait for our party of five on Saturday at around 6, so I guess the trick is to come early because they were packed when we left around 8 or so.. . We ordered several dishes, including the crispy artichoke, foie gras, fried chicken wings, and the valenciana and serrano paellas.  The paellas could easily feed three people per serving, but they do take up to 40 minutes to make.  They were delicious!  The rice is moist and flavorful, and they don't scrimp onthe ingredients here either (as they shouldn't because one paella is easily 40+ dollars).  Between the two, it's hard for me to decide which one I liked more, although the serrano was definitely appealing given the baby back ribs and fresh kale in the rice.  . . The fried chicken wings were easily my second favorite dish.  They were crispy on the outside, featured lots of meat on the bones, and were sweet and tangy in flavor.  This dish came recommended to us by our server, and it was a great pick.. . The crispy artichoke was good, although not super memorable.  I remember thinking that the "tapas" style seemed a bit odd given that the size of the plate and portions were quite large.  Not sure I'd order this again but would probably want to try another veg.. . The foie gras was quite delicate.  It's always a treat to be able to order this since you can no longer get it in California.  It came sandwiched between cooked apple slices that were a bit mushy too and a sweet sauce.  I'd probably get it again just because it's a treat!  . . Service:  This was a stand out.  Our server - Pedro - was friendly, efficient, and so helpful.  He liked to chat and joke with us, and overall made the dining experience really enjoyable.  . . Service:  Looking for a nice meal in Vegas and tired of all the buffets?  Check this Spanish tapas restaurant out.
I really enjoyed my dinner at this restaurant. It exceeded my expectations. For a busy restaurant to have professional and timely service is quite difficult yet Julian Serrano didn't skip a best. . . The food left my palate begging for more. From the appetizer to the desert you can appreciate how much detail they devote to the taste and presentation of the food. . . My suggestion is to try the lamb.
We ate at Julian Serrano in the Aria on a whim during our stay in Las Vegas. I really didn't know much about it other than it was Spanish food. As we entered the restaurant, the energy was electric. Many people obviously really enjoying themselves, waiters bustling to and fro, bars lined with people eating and drinking. We ordered several small plates and everything was fantastic.  Perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  Raw yellowtail wrapped around shredded crisp sweet potato was one of the greatest pieces of fish I've ever tasted. Amazing.  Gambas in a spicy tomato sauce was also super delicious. Perfectly cooked and so fresh.  Gazpacho with lobster also incredible. Rich and delicious.  Whitefish ceviche was also perfect: very citrusy but also balanced.  Even the olives were outstanding!  I can't say enough about how wonderful this meal was.  And not so very expensive either. We spent about $100 for two of us with two glasses of wine. Not bad at all for such great food in LV.
I was in Vegas Labor Day weekend and ate here twice. It was bomb both times. i loved it. I accidentally happen to go on the second day during happy hour and that was cool.. . the food is very good, small plates which i like. quality over quantity. . . You should try this place.
I had this restaurant on my list for several years and I finally got to try it couple of months ago.  The place was lively, cute and fun.  Got to try a lot of interesting items on the menu and loved everything.  The sangria was flowing all night and was delicious.  Can't wait to go back.
Visited for lunch during Fall Restaurant Week and their prie fixe was just $20.14. I haven't always heard great things about the restaurant, so admittedly, I'd written it off as a place that wasn't worth my time or money. I'm glad to say that I was impressed with the selections and enjoyed my meal.. . First impressions: Gorgeous space! I like how open the restaurant is and what a great decision with the beautiful Aria lobby next to it. The decor is has a touch of elegance and great colors and patterns. The large, heavy armchairs were comfortable and a nice change from the simple dining chairs.. . Lobster Gazpacho: Chilled Spanish tomato soup, lobster meat, and cherries. The soup had a light and rounded flavor, however, I couldn't necessarily taste the lobster. If this wasn't a gazpacho, it would be really delicious served warm/hot.. . Wild Mushroom Soup: Shiitake, crimini, and oyster mushrooms; mushroom foie gras crouton. This was another first course option. The soup had a surprising depth of flavor that I wasn't expecting from mushrooms (not sure if the broth was just mushrooms). Delicious. Also, the mushroom foie gras crouton was really nice.. . Salmon: Scottish Salmon, creamy whipped potato, and horseradish cream. The salmon was well-prepared and all of its accompaniments worked nicely with it. Solid salmon dish.. . Rib Eye Steak: Roasted Chinese eggplant, french fries, and mushroom demi sauce. I ordered my ribeye "rare plus" and they delivered! It was absolutely beautiful. I wanted to sing a symphony. Besides the steak being perfect, the demi sauce was delicious and I loved the eggplant as well. The fries were great.. . Flan de Turron: Almond creme custard, whipped cream, and turron. Okay, this dessert was honestly one of the best desserts I've ever eaten. I love custard, however, I don't always find flans always pleasant because the texture needs to be just right. This flan was perfection. The custard held its shape, but was extremely creamy and the flavors of the turron and the flan created this explosion! What a great way to end a meal!. . I would like to come back and try some of their tapas, but the prices are a deterrent. For now, I would definitely recommend a meal here during RW.
So delicious and so many amazing choices to please everyone at the table. Great service and friendly staff. I can't stop thinking about organic pork chop, scallops and braised short ribs. Flan for dessert... YumYum!!
Even though this is a beautiful venue with nice service, the food is supremely overrated. I am in full support of splurging for good food but there wasn't anything special about the food to warrant the cost. I had the ceviche, mussels, and paella. Each of the dishes were disappointingly bland despite the fact that they were described similarly to how the dishes are prepared in authentic Spanish restaurants. The only thing I found to be surprisingly unique was the sangria. Unfortunately, that's all my tummy walked away feeling satisfied with. Also, keep in mind that this is a tapas restaurant so the portions are tiny (smaller than typical tapas servings). If you insist on eating here for the beautiful experience/ ambience, be sure to order accordingly.
Awesome tapas. Black rice is the BEST! And the tuna cones...and the ceviche...and the grilled calamari. YUM!
