Great Food! Average Service and Very Loud Inside! We were there 08/19/2014 our first visit to the Mesa Grill. We had a large group (10) and were put in a back room with another group. This are was VERY loud and we had a hard time talking together. The service was ok, but not to the level one would hope for from a Name like this. The food made up for most thing the Lamb was one of the best I have ever had! We will probably go back and try again!
Sunday brunch was great! My husband had the pork sandwich, which was perfectly balanced in all the flabors. I had the spicy chicken sweet potato hash, moderate spice, great brunch dish. We both enjoyed our meals, but noticed other tables were offer the daily special and we weren't and the worng meals weere brought out initially, but quickly fixed... otherwise good service!
Went here for dinner. I dined here a few years ago and it was excellent. I was surprised this time. It was very disappointing, especially for the price. The steak wasn't very flavorful and the tuna was bland. Even the baked potato wasn't that great. Definitely wasn't worth 9 bucks. Anyway, hope they get it together. If you're in Vegas and going to spend 150 on a meal, spend it somewhere else.
Not sure why it's labeled as Southern food.  I'd call it more like Southwestern.  I had the rubbed pork dish which has been a staple on their menu for many many years. And with that special sauce on the plate made from one of the special kinds of chili peppers....  Excellent! Excellent!  It's a must try if you ever get there.  Drinks were really good especially when you have that fancy smoked flavored shot added to your drink.  Incredible!  It is a nice place.
We were a party of 9 for my mothers wedding. The moment we walked into Mesa we were greeted and the entire experience was excellent. Our waiter Arnel was very professional and even offerred suggesstions on wine selection and food / sides, he gets a 10/10. We had the mango ahi which was more of a seered ahi and it was excellent with the green peppercorn sauce (a small sliver of mango to accent the dish would have been perfect) . We will definatly come back here , from san francisco to pensylvania to st. Louis to arizona, this place by far is our numbetlr one. Thank you for everything and the cactis fruit margharita is to die for!
Food is decent but way overpriced.  It felt like they were trying too hard.  My hubby wanted the lamb but as soon as he ordered they ran out.  So he got the 22 Oz steak that is huge and has a good spice to it.  I ordered the Tina steak and it was seasoned well but so cold which made it taste off.
You can't go wrong with Bobby Flay!. We had one of the most delicious meal here.. August '14. . Food:. We ordered three-course meal.. Mine was Roasted corn soup, smoked shrimp taco, and flan. My wife had Rough cut tuna nachos, spicy chicken sweet potato hash, chocolate mouse(or something like that).. The started bread they gave us was very different than a typical started in any other restaurant (regular bread with butter).. Corn soup was a brilliant blend of sweet and spicy. Tuna and shrimps were fresh. Each sauce has quite unique taste (Guacamole is probably standard). The spicy mango sauce (if I hear what the server told me correctly) was heavenly; it blends well with the guacamole and salsa. Sweet potato is cooked through such that it has texture (not like baby food) topped with perfectly cooked poached eggs.. Chocolate mousse dessert has 2 different mousse that complement each other taste very well. The caramel chunk provides a nice texture. . In summary, food was very good.. . Service:. Waiters are very friendly and attentive. They also know the menu well and were able to provide useful recommendation. We had a nice experience the moment we stepped into the restaurant. . . Overall, the restaurant exceeded our expectation in both food and service.
A few days in Vegas and many planned culinary experiences planned. Our first is Mesa Grill. What a great start to our dining experiences and expectations. Excellent service, fantastic food and drinks. Congratulations to both front of house and back of house is what was our only experience that exceeded expectations. . Thank you from both my wife and me.
Bobby flays place is exactly what'd you'd expect from the southwest flavor king. I ordered the corn tortilla soup and man it was spicy and delicious!  For the main I got the spiced pork tenderloin sandwich. Definitely a must try. You have to come to his place with the expectation that everything will have his signature kick to it. . . I came on a Tuesday day time and there was still a small wait for lunch. I recommend calling in a reservation if you're dinning in for dinner.
Lovely Tex-Mex experience. The chile relleno was beautifully presented and tasted great. The banana creme pie was also delicious. Caution though. This place is a bit pricey. Had a $14 margarita. My husbands lamb was $45. He said it was delicious though. We will come here every time we are in Vegas!
Food was good but a little too spicy for me. The complimentary bread was even spicy. I really couldn't enjoy my food because it was freezing ! Apparently it is always like that because they offered all the woman in my party a shawl!!
Still as good as ever. I went last night. It was the first time going in almost 3 years. Well, I don't know why it took so long to get back here. It is hands down my favorite restaurant. Just the blue corn pancakes alone are enough to bring me back over and over again. . Last night i went with my beautiful wife and everything was excellent as usual. We had tiger shrimp tamales and blue corn pancake for appetizers, both were perfect. I had the veal and my wife had the lamb, both perfect. We both had a couple drinks...traditional margaritas and prickly pear margaritas, again, both perfect. . I love this place. The flavors are unbelievable. Now of course I know that is a matter of opinion because not everyone likes the same flavors, but I will say this and this is not opinion. Everything is prepared to perfection. They get everything right. From temps to presentation. From timing to service. From pricing to ultra high quality. This place is amazing.
Food was good but there are better around.  It was too salty for me but we could get in without reservations and that is not easy in Vegas now.
Gorgeous place of course. Very modern, bright and open, it's Caesar's Palace and they really wanted Bobby Flay; as tasteful and modern as Southwestern can git.. . We went for lunch late on a Wed afternoon during a conference break and it was surprisingly slow there at 1:45. Breadbasket is delicious of course with those Jalapeno corn muffins, beautiful works of art at half yellow and blue corn swirl. We started by splitting the Blue Corn pancake BBQ Duck which was smoky with low heat and just yummy.. For our entrees we had a Lamb chopped salad and a Chili Releno that looked even better than it tasted, and it tasted fantastic. They manage to get a very light batter on the chili and then somehow seal it with the cheese inside so that it 'blows up", really impressive. The lamb was a perfect medium rare and the salad good sized for what are generally small portions here. Presentation all Bobby Flay.. . Service from Michael was attentive, even relaxed considering there wasn't a dozen people in the restaurant, so come late our usual plan. They are definitely pushing drinks like most Vegas restaurants and you can see the disappointment in their faces when we order our usual lunch time iced tea and a water with lemon, no ice.. . Highly recommended and not crazy pricey, but still a $75 lunch with one appetizer and two entrees and one ice tea. Do it.
Came here for lunch with 4 family members during restaurant week. Most of us chose to order off the regular menu since we didn't think we could eat everything on the pre-fixe menu. . . I was really impressed by the menu and creativity of some of the dishes. I'm a big enough food network fan to know of Bobby Flay's reputation and his specialties. The lunch/brunch menu I felt was a little light- not as many lunch options as I would have liked. I had the green chili cheeseburger, knowing that BF rocks burgers. It was super delicious and one of the most melt in your mouth burgers I've ever had. Everyone I was with also enjoyed their meal. My favorite part of the meal was the bread/pastry basket. Not only did we get bread, but also jalapeno biscuits, blueberry scones, and chocolate muffins! Never have I experienced a bread basket quite so wonderful. . . Service was great, but the ambiance was lacking. I'm not sure if it was because we were there for lunch, but it just seemed kind of bland and dull. Not too busy and not quite the scene would imagine for a BF restaurant. All in all, great burger though.
Love this Resturaunt and everything wonderful ( wouldn't mind if they lowered the prices though ) exceptional service ( we had 3 people serving us ) Delicious food and Dessert ! If your ever in Vegas Treat Yourself !
Loved the Bobby Flay version of the Chile Relleno with eggplant and cheese filling, and also the grilled spicey chicken.  Margaritas were also top notch!  Absolutely recommend to others!
White peach margarita was so delicious!! Had the salmon for lunch and it was the best I have ever had!
I went as a party of 3 for lunch. They did not allow hats in the dining area but theyare allowed at the small bar. Highly recommend the roasted corn soup for an appetizer.  It was amazingly delicious and what you come to expect from Bobby Flay with his spicy flair. Just the right amount of heat, zest, and lightness.  . . For an entree,  I chose the "New Mexican Spiced Tenderloin Sandwich". This was sadly underwhelming.  Thin slices of pork and not crazy pork flavor.. . Dessert, we shared a nice big piece of a coconut cake. I'm not a big coconut type of person but this dessert was amazing. Great deep and rich flavors.
Exquisite. Exquisite. Exquisite. I came here with 3 others for dinner and enjoyed our experience. We had a reservation and were seated promptly upon arrival. The service was fantastic and the food was even better. I had a NY Strip steak, which was nice and juicy. The portion was large enough for 2. I'm not a huge fan of corn but their corn is to die for so I recommend getting it as a side. I find myself craving this meal at times. . Kudos to Bobby Flay. This man does no wrong. A meal here is worth a flight to Vegas. :)
This was my first time frequenting a Bobby Flay establishment, and I wasn't disappointed. The service was impeccable, it got the point where it was borderline creepy how on-point the entire waiting staff was. All I can say is, the nice guy charged with watching my water glass better get a raise ASAP because he redefined the term "attentive." . . Due to several factors (okay fine, one factor: Vegas taking more money than expected), I ended up dismissing the many delectable looking meat entrees and ordered the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon. And holy mother of food, was it sublime. . . On a more minor note, the bread is also a gamechanger. It might not be the gaudiest or most hyped restaurant on The Strip (or Caesers for that matter), but Mesa Grill is a top-notch option for anyone looking for a quality fine dining experience.
So convenient to go to when staying at Caesars Palace.  Delicious food!  Great atmosphere!
