Walked in and thought it was bloody boujie.    But boy was I wrong. They sat us in right away and I didnt even have to slip them a 20 to be first in line. There service was impeccable. We changed tables as many times as the color wheel from twister. The waitress gave us her recommendations and the lamb burger was to die for. The first bite I took was filled with creamy savory feta and carmalized onions that just make u think of being on vacation and remembering the first step u took out of the plane watching the sun set in the horizon. Yes it was like an oasis in my mouth accompanied by a savory but lean and juicy lamb patty that was perfectly spiced. The lamb was so delicious I had to buy the chef a shot of patron. Kudos chef ramsey. I was so stuffed that I couldn't make room for dessert. So I excused myself from the table and threw up in the restroom so i could have some of their world famous bread pudding.  I cant even begin to describe the bread pudding. Its consistency was more like a cake that crumbled as it touch my lips. The ice cream was light and whipped with crunchy peanut brittle that made me pause from reading shadesof gray. Yes it was that good.  Chef ramsey left my loins on fire. Kudos!!!!
Our group of 6 wanted to try this place for the first time so tonight we went for dinner. Most of us were ordering a burger when were told that they did not have any, but the server did offer us lamb burger as a substitute...How can a restaurant such as this one not have any burgers left on Labor Day weekend?! We left the restaurant and will not be coming back!
I really wasn't too impressed. I didn't feel like the menu was very diverse, but even then - what we did order was just OK. I ordered the sliders with fries and the group I was with all tried other parts of the menu: salad, salmon, burger.... . Would I give it another chance? Maybe if a friend really wanted to try it, or there wasn't much else open. A visiting friend asked if they should try it recently and I suggested other places with more flavor and a better menu.
Service was great. The food was good as well. Had the burger, wife had the pesto chicken sandwich. Pub atmosphere reasonably priced for vegas.
Since I've eaten at pubs throughout England I was a bit disappointed.   Obviously,  you are only paying for ramseys name, because if this is how he cooks then he needs a new profession.  We ordered pretzel sticks, bangers n mash, and fish n chips.  I've fried fish that tasted better.  The fries were so limp they should be put down.
Tonight we had one of the best servers we've ever encountered. For you foodies out there, Julio knows how to pair food/beverages. A must for a great experience in LV.
Went for lunch... I've had better.. . With 300+ seats and 3+ turns per meal, it's a factory.
One of the better meals I've ever had in my life.  Came here as a large group for a fun dinner out. Server was awesome. He was outgoing and fun. Food was amazing. Everyone shared and we had a great time!!!. Ordered the beer braised short rib and it did not disappoint. My friends were all jealous. Compliments to the chef who came out to check on us. He talked with us and asked how we liked the good. Props man!! We were greeted by the manager as well half way thru. All around a top notch establishment.
Was very excited to eat at a GR place since my whole family watches all his shows and I own several of his cookbooks. Ordered the burger medium it came out raw. However they didn't refire it. They gave a whole new burger. The fried calimari must have been baby squid as the ring size was infinitesimal and all breading. Then the fish for the fish and chips just didn't taste good at all. However the star was the 3 mini pies. Steak and ale, Shepards and chicken pot.
We went with 14 people and one of the burgers where raw inside and 2 of the people had to wait 24 minutes after we all got our meals and the food was ok. The bills came out and everything was wrong and it took over 1 hr for them to figure out and the overcharge was almost $100.00. I don't think Gordon would stand for this if he oversaw the restaurant he would tell his staff to get the f out... Very disappointing
We had dinner around 5 and we're able to catch the last of happy hour drinks. They were out of a couple tap beers but the food was excellent. The food did take awhile to come out but the woodburned chicken salad with shrimp was definitely work it. The avocado dressing was the shizzle. My boyfriend had the club and he wouldve liked it more if the toast was cooked a little less. It was so toasted that it was cutting the roof of his mouth.
When something has Gordon Ramsey's name on it you expect a well run restaurant, top notch service and excellent food. Unfortunately our entire group left disappointed on all 3 points. Here is where they failed..... - seated late for our reservation (large group of 16). - staff could have been friendlier . - The washrooms were gross (a reflection on what the kitchen looks like?). - the food was mediocre, disappointed and expected better!. - one burger order came out raw. - the waiter got the order wrong then tried to place blame on the 2 people which ordered. - they had to wait 25 mins for the right order while the rest of us ate our food. The food came once everyone else was done eating.(was told it would be 7 mins). - was told bills could not be separated...they had to do a minimum of 4 cheques- despite our telling 3 servers how to separate the 4 bills at the start of our meal it didn't happen. We had to wait for an additional 30 mins for the bill to be separated...we also had to calculate taxes and gratuity ourselves. . - the entire experience was a 3 hour ordeal which is much too long when u want to get out and experience Vegas!! . . The good points.... - sticky toffee pudding!! . - truffle fries
Service is awful. Food is so so. We waited 30 minutes for the food to arrive only after our server pointed out to us that we were at Gordon Ramsey spot and not Applebees or Denny's. Uh no shit! Meanwhile folks that sat down after us got their food before ours ever came to our table. We did not order anything complicated that it took 30 minutes to get to our table. The communication was poor from the server to us.
Pricy pub food that doesn't stand out from the rest besides their lobster roll appetizer and sticky toffee pudding which was amazing.
Five stars for the food and beer selection here.. . I like food, I like beer. Give me really good food with a really good beer spin that around with some really helpful service, and we are talking.  The secret to getting the best experience here is asking your server what are the specials and recommendations.  On multiple occasions, the server led me onto a tasty new adventure.  One of their highly recommended beers is the Scottish Innis and Gunn.  The server recommended this very crisp and refreshing ale to me.  It has become the centerpiece of what I am basing my dinner on.  Do not be afraid to ask them what they would pair your food with.  My servers on the occasions I have gone here, really sold the food choices by their descriptions.. One evening, I tried the Shepard's Pie.  Very flavorful, very moist.  It is lamb based, rather than ground beef.  The potatoes on top were just so soft and melted in my mouth.. Another one to try is the bacon cheeseburger.  Sounds simple enough, but that bacon is maple bacon...  The server told me that the bacon starts the day before.  It is cut up then soaked overnight in pure maple syrup.  It is then cooked with more syrup. I am telling you this right now, IT IS GOOD.  It is gooder than good. The chef that afternoon even came out to check on some tables.  I told him right there, "Best thing I ever put in my mouth.". Service was top notch.  Friendly, knowledgable servers that know the menu and the beers available. Do not be afraid to use them to help you decide on your meal.  They know their stuff.
Vegas weekend! !! Had to come here being a fan of Ramsay...  I have to say drink choices are incredible... food even better took a little time to get here but soo worth it.... portions are small but delish ...  will be coming back
The service was horrible! The last time we spoke to our server was when he took our orders. He never came back to check up on us. And he wasn't busy at all running orders and checking on his tables because the times I did see him on the floor was when he'd bring the bill to his tables and serve them water. We were able to catch another waitress that was serving the table next to us to grab us more water and steak sauce, and she wasn't very pleasant. Our bill came out to $225. No gratuity. Sorry, not sorry.. . The food was OK. I ordered the prime rib. It could've used more seasoning. The restaurant was laid back. This was definitely not a place for kids.
Updated to a 3-star for the prompt response from the restaurant manager who promised to look into the service we received that night, extended his apologies, as well as an invitation to try them out again... I look forward to taking up on his offer when I'm in LV next.
Took my brother in law here for dinner because he is a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay. We made reservations, asked to be by the kitchen, and also mentioned it was a birthday dinner. They didn't relay any of that information when it came time to dine but at least they had our reservation on file. . . Service was awful during our visit. My brother in law ordered the Onion soup and they brought it out to him without a spoon. We had to flag down our waiter and ask for the spoon. They were also "conveniently" out of their house wine so we were forced to spend more money on wine with dinner. . . When it came time for the bill we had to wait about 10 minutes for him to bring it. . . If Gordon Ramsay knew how terrible the service was at this place he might make a visit and set them straight. At no point should the waiter tell me that $17 calamari is justified no matter the quality because we are in Caesars Palace. To be fair, the calamari was decent. . . I am only giving 2 stars because of the terrible service. The food was good, not great. I can get better at my local pub for a lot less money.
Great food! Loved the ribs and Mac n cheese lobster, . Our drinks were a bit to strong if a little lighter I might have had two drinks instead of one. . . Overall I had a great time
The service was amazing! The bartenders are so nice. You need to get the truffle chips!!!!!!!!!!!
Food was good, only thing is that in our party of 7 they tried to charge us an automatic 18% gratuity when this is not stated on the menu. For most places is when you have an 8 group. Awful experience, even they called security.
AMAZINGLY good!  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere was very relaxing and staff was very knowledgeable.  Look forward to going back again.
Food was good but portions were small and expensive for what you got. $22 for a pot pie.  Thought it would be larger but about the same size as a frozen Swansons. Got five medium scallops and 3 out of the 5 clams had no clams in it. I know vegas is expensive but this was too much.
Ate there last night.  We just had Fried Calamari and burgers.  Calamari is crispy and tender and not overly breaded.  Burgers were delicious-- cooked perfectly with great toppings-- caramelized onions, crispy bacon, cheese sauce. The best was our lovely waitress Kim. If I ever went back I'd ask for her. Very personable, friendly, funny and attentive.
The restaurant is very nice inside*. The staff was very courteous and attentive.. I had the sirloin steak... Perfectly seasoned , quality beef flavor,awesome asparagus and mashed potatoes. The dish was excellent and all balanced out great.. I tried the lollipop chicken drummets and they were great* nice bleu cheese sauce.. The sticky toffee pudding was amazing as well. I sampled some beef sliders, and they were also very good
I have eaten at his steak house and it got great marks. His burger place is good. the pub sounds like a grand concept but it does not measure up. food is average at best and that is stretching it. The prices are over the top. 4 beers and appetizers at lunch and a bill of 140 at lunch for 2 people.... I seldom comment on price-- more than willing to pay for good food but this was not good while being over priced. Vegas ahs many better choices.
None of us enjoyed our meals.  I got a BLT.  I didn't think it was possible to ruin a BLT. It was not edible.  I'm pretty sure if someone served that to Gordon he would spit it out.  The service was almost as bad.
Underwhelmed.  Gave four dishes a try and all of them were mediocre. I had high hopes for thier famous fish and chips, but to my disappontment, it was nothing special.  I've had better elsewhere at 1/3 the cost.  Food was bland, beer was warm and portions were small.  . . I hate the feeling of spending good money and leaving the restaurnt hungry.  . . One saving grace for this place was the excellent service of the staff.  Our server was fast, attentive and addressed everyone at our table by our first names.  Impressive. . . Too bad I can't say the same for their food.  As Golden Ramsay says... 'Shame'
Amazing! We stopped in for some food and drinks while visiting Vegas on 9/5/14. Our server was very accommodating and suggested a cucumber wine spritzer that was out of this world. The lobster roll, sliders and clams were all delicious! The manager stopped to check on our table, we were so impressed with our service we told him he needs to get our server a raise. Awesome atmosphere, will be back for sure
I would not come back.  The prices were high for bar food and there were several misprints on the menu.  I expected more from Gordon Ramsey.  Food was average.  The one good thing was the devil eggs... If you find yourself there, get them!
Great Decor and the food was good.  They had all the College Games on their many TVs.  Our server was clearly working a section that was too big for her, but other than that things were fine.
Nightmare happy hour. 25 popcorn cold for $5. Bacon wrapped datesa ???? Unknown. Cold . $5. So small.  Like one slice of bacon !. . gr. U should be embarrassed . This would. Never pass on your show. . Minus 5 stars
Gordon, I'm surprised. Was really looking forward to the experience, but overall, kind of disappointed. Good is a bit overpriced, but expected for Vegas.. . I had the Bangers and Mash, wife had Prime Rib. Quite frankly, both wee under seasoned. My Banger quite small. :) and the mash was too creamy. Wife's prime rib really needed a bit more seasoning. Horseradish tasted really watered down.. . Service was good, though it did take a little longer than expected for the entrees, especially since our appetizer came out super fast. We also had the "DIC" desert. Keep in mind, there's Bourbon in the caramel, so be aware. It was delicious, by far the best part of the Menu.. . Overall, for the price we paid two, the Baccanal Buffet would of been a much better value and experience.
Came here for dinner last week while I was in LV.  The setup and decor is nice and classy.  I know there were some negative Yelp reviews about the service but our servers were great.. . I had the Braised Short Ribs, which are very meaty and cooked pretty well.  It was a big piece of meat, which was good.  The cut of meat was kind of chewy though so disappointed for the price I paid.  Taste wise, the ribs were pretty good.  I left the sides, they weren't that awesome.  I also had some wine and a Guinness beer. . . The restaurant was extremely loud so it was hard to hear other people talk.. . So overall, I would say this place is very overpriced, the decor is cool, the food is not bad but ok overall.  Bring your wallet, it's Vegas.
I was so looking forward to coming here. It was the one place I told my friends that I really wanted to go. I don't think I have ever felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant in my entire life. We went at a non-peak time, restaurant half empty, just to grab a couple of drinks. We told the hostesses and waiters we were just getting drinks. Took nearly 30 minutes to get first drink order. Then our waiter complained about us to hostess since we were not ordering food. He grabbed everything off our table and was super short with us. Hostess then came over and apologized and said we weren't being rushed out, but could move to another table. Since we were done with our drinks, we just opted to leave. I would have loved to come back, but there is no point. I am not a fussy diner, I don't send food back and never write negative reviews but, this really ruined an experience for me that I was actually really looking forward to.
My new Husband and I went to Pub & Grill because we LOVE Gordon Ramsay and watch hells kitchen & master chef every season! The waiter, Taylor, was EXTREMLEY helpful to us in picking out the best entree's to have. I had the Grilled Lamb Burger - YUMM! My husband had the Grilled NY Strip - DELISH!  Our server overheard that we had asked for Ranch dressing and instead of leaving me to use the blue cheese that was brought to me - he brought me a number of options one of which included a cheese dip (which anyone who knows me knows I cannot say no to cheese dip)! Everything was amazing - I cant wait to go back one day!
So you would think a very public british chef that makes a tv career reforming failing restaurants with "Kitchen Nightmares" or spends his time mentoring (read: for the most part screaming at and using a marine sergeants approach in the kitchen) up and coming chefs would really have a venue baring his name locked down tight.. . Sadly no. Just no. In fact "HELL NO".. . I came in with a group of 5 people to celebrate a birthday and try an early dinner since the latest winner of Hell's Kitchen had arrived 2 weeks ago. From my experience I feel like a bad friend for suggesting the place.. . Really when you goto a restaurant there are 3 different things that you rate the place by: atmosphere (looks), food, and service. You measure your expectations of these things by location, chef, and price. So lets run down the list shall we?. . The place itself is on the main casino floor of caesars casino and they had a great time decorating it with a lot of british pub flair that still is up beat and modern looking. So really they nailed it here. The bar area is very inviting and tvs on the walls make it comfy and the restaurant area is equally inviting. . . The problem of course is when you go to order the actual food. As I said we came in for an early dinner (6pm) so the venue was fully staffed and maybe only 20% full with patrons. This should be an easy task for the staff. But, my experience rendered that assumption otherwise. To be fair our waiter was extremely up beat and full of suggestions and we were sat quite quickly so I can put most of the onus of service issues on back of house. But upon ordering it took almost 30 minutes for the table to get their alcoholic drinks. That just doesn't ring well with anyone. Especially a group of people that are in the mood to celebrate. Whats even worse is the food took well over 40 min before appetizers and starters came out with one of the more attentive managers checking in on us the entire time being very shocked that food was moving so slow that I could have walked into the mall, ordered food at any other place, taken it to go, and eaten it before our starters came out. . . So lets talk about whats really most important, the food! Since we were in a group of mixed friends that all love to eat we kind of did a one of everything approach to our starters and shared whatever came out. This would be cool if there was some hit or misses but, in our case the entire table just got more disheartened right up front after the long wait which is kind of a great way to crush the excitement and spirits of your guests prior to the main course I guess. The sliders were way over cooked, the fried calamari was bland, the scotch egg was downright forgettable, the toad in the hole should have stayed in whatever hole it came from as it was absent of any real flavor, and the lobster roll had an odd after taste to it (more on this later). The only positives here were the fries and the lollipop wings. In fact we scarfed the fries because they were the only thing stood out as not just edible but tasty with the included aioli. . . So lets say if you order starters the only thing nearly worth while are the fries. From a british gastropub? Wrong on so many levels.. . So now lets move onto the main course. Something you would want to do in a decent time after the first round of food. But, the kitchen staff had the idea of letting us wait till we were really hungry for it before serving it. Yes I am being sarcastic, no it wasn't cool, and as you can guess it was far from worth the wait. So the main course comes after 2 more rounds of drinks that took to long and a manger was still "shocked" at the food service time. If you're counting at home do the math and you can see this is entirely too long. The next round of food included the wedge salad that wasn't even a wedge and the dressing didn't even have the right to call itself Bleu Cheese as it lacked any flavor and was so watery we wondered what the dressing did to offend the chef, the scallops that hey were cooked perfectly yet lacked any trace of seasoning, the lobster mac & cheese that we all agreed should have skipped the lobster, the chicken pot pie with a perfect crust yet lacked any flavor from the inside ingredients and the short rib that was so unbelievably void of the texture and flavor that it was sent back with the question of why a place like this would serve something that is supposed to be flavorful and tender but comes off like a bad croc pot version of pot roast. The one shining positive was the BLT which we all agreed just nailed it.. . So after trying almost half the menu we are left with fries and the BLT being the only things that are positive standouts? At this price point?!?!? Are you kidding me? . . When it comes to dessert the sticky toffee pudding was however to die for. . . Oh remember the lobster? Yeah all 3 people that had it felt slightly ill after. This place is a kitchen nightmare. Such a let down and a terrible experience.
Food is very good. Atmosphere is well planned. But our waiter was snotty and not friendly at all. Barely spoke as he took our orders, just nodded.
Ok it's been a while since I actually stepped foot in this joint but I'd just like to share our experience from the one time I tried to eat here. . My girl and I are at Caesars looking for a bite and I decided on Ramsey's pub n grill so we stood at the hostess desk for a good fee minutes before we were even spoken to by one of the 3 girls in miniskirts that were talking to eachother. Then we are taken to a seat in the bar area next to all the kegs that were used as the divider for the bar area and the seating area. We were not asked if we wanted to sit at the bar, my girl always will prefer a booth but we were not given that option. . We were seated and left alone for about 5min before I had to flag down a busser to ask for a menu. Looking at the menu for about 5-10 more minutes we were never approached by another employee at all. We were not offered water or drinks or asked if we were ready to order. Now considering the fact that by the time we each have a meal and a drink we were looking to spend close to $100 for burgers we elected to just get up and walk out. As far as the food goes I have actually eaten wings and a burger from here while playing poker in Caesars poker room and it is pretty good food from what I have seen. Having said that I cannot say the same for their service in my particular case. I'm sorry with me you only get one shot at my business I really see no reason to go back after my initial experience. I would rather go to Bachi Burger by my house and only spend $40-$50 for an even better quality meal that you will get here. . . Sorry Gordon I just call them the way I see them , from watching all your shows I was honestly shocked by the service we encountered. End Rant!!
After dinner...also at at Caesar's shopping forum....we decided to have some more wine and a snack to go with it. We stumbled across this place on our way to the casino and decided to give it a shot since it was Gordon Ramsey's place. The place was packed and very noisy, and there would have been a 20 minute wait if we decided to sit in the dining area. We then decided to sit at the bar where we were free to seat ourselves.. . I can't comment on the dishes here, but the "Nachos" we ordered were out of this world. I actually thought they were actual corn nachos, but they were in fact kettle fried potato chips (English style I guess) with a sour cream sauce, melted cheddar cheese, and red chillies on top. All I will say is, it was so so so hard to stop eating them! ...yes, they were that good! Together with a glass of wine or an ice cold beer, this'll make an excellent pub snack.. . Service was good and the waitress was friendly and attentive. Definitely a nice buzzing place to get together with friends.
We went for lunch and the atmosphere here struck me as strange... I thought we would be walking into an authentic, laid back, English pub and what we got was a formal, sit down, dining experience with a traditional bar menu. It's even hard to describe and this is why I can't score this more than 3 stars. Maybe we made the mistake of sitting on the restaurant side vs the bar? But a pub should be a pub (as in the name).. . Our waiter was fabulous and I fell in love with him a little bit, but it is too bad about the uniforms because he looked ridiculous as does everyone else working here. @GordonRamsay you need to rethink this choice, I don't care who designed them.. . Food was good and my fish and chips were enough to feed an army (and so was the price).
