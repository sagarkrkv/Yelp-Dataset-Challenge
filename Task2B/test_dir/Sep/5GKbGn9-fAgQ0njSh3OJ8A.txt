The restaurant is gorgeous inside, but we ate out on the patio and it was also beautiful some of the nicest bathrooms I have seen! I tried the Lavolini which was super tart and delish!. We had the kobe rice balls for an appetizer they were crisp and cheesy. The garlic bread was amazing.. My friend had the seafood alfredo and said it was one of the best she ever had and I had the mushroom and chicken ravioli great portion size and also very good.. . No dessert we were too full but everything was fantastic.. Our waiter was also super attentive and very sweet.
Lavo is my fave place to dine in Vegas! I love the Kobe beef meatball, the creamy lobster bisque soup , the garlic bread w sauce, everything is so YUMMY!! Quality of food is top notch! Def go and eat any occasion!!! It's the best!!
LOVED it!!! I made dinner reservations for my friends bachelorette party on Friday night. We booked the "Lavo Feast" which was served family style. We had the pizza and calamari for appetizers, salad, Spaghetti, chicken Marsala, mashed potatoes, asparagus, and dessert. The dessert was just ok and I felt the calamari could have been more crispy, but other then that I thought the food tasted GREAT! The service was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was perfect for our bachelorette party and after dinner we were able to walk right into Tao's night club (Bring your dinner receipt). Well worth the money. I highly recommend it!!
One of the best on the Vegas Strip... Kobe Meatballs, Veal Parmesan and the Ricotta Cavetelli were the most outstanding!  Also check out the Peanut Butter chocolate layer cake.. out of this world and can feed a table of 8.  Great atmosphere too. There is a lot of competition, but this one you will not be sorry for if you are looking for not your average everyday Italian restaurant.
Best. Meatballs. Ever.  Nuff said.. . Okay, I'll say more. Seriously this place was amazing. I'm getting hungry again just thinking about how great our meal was. We were in Vegas during restaurant week and 4 out of the 5 of us ordered off the pre-fixe menu. We shared one of the kobe beef meatballs with ricotta and tomato sauce to start. This was amazing!! Served in a mini cast-iron skillet and served piping hot. Gah. Amazing. We were also served fresh garlic bread, right out of the oven. One of the best starts to a meal I've probably ever had. We also had a bottle of Malbec which really set off all the rich dishes. . . For my pre fixe menu, I had the arancini, penne ala vodka, and strawberry shortcake. Unfortunately the rest of the meal didn't quite live up the start, but everything was still fantastic. Arancini was soft and fluffly, and penne had a great vodka sauce (penne was a little al dente in my opinion). I only had a couple bites of my dessert since I was so full at that point, but that was also wonderful. . . Service was absolutely fantastic. We had several different waiters buzzing around us throughout the course of the meal clearing plates, filling water, and checking on us. Our server was super friendly and outgoing- even bumped my mom out of the bad mood she was in. Wonderful Italian on the strip!
Decor was great. Food was great with incredible desserts . Staff was excellent. Unfortunately, our waiter was not so attentive and acted as if he was too busy. Restaurant was half full! To management: we were the party of 6 placed in the back corner round table and was seated at 7:30pm Monday night
i know the dinner here is amazing and deserves 4 or 5 stars, but i came here for brunch which i thought was average. . . the ambiance is trendy, with a relaxing outdoor seating area. the service was great and i really liked our waitress; she was super nice and helpful. both the ambiance and service truly deserve 5 stars, the food however is a 3. . . you start off brunch with a basket of pastries, which i thought were more delicious than the food honestly. our server said that the pastries change all the time, but you could tell they were fresh and homemade. i ordered the make your own omelet, while my fiancee got the nutella and banana crepe. the omelet wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but the side of homefries that came with the dish were very yummy. i'm not a big fan of crepes, but i thought the nutella and banana crepe was pretty good. the portions here are pretty big as well, so come with a big appetite.. . it wasn't the worst place i've been to for brunch, but i would consider another restaurant during my next stay in vegas.
Everything about Lavo is yummmm! Starting with the DELISH garlic bread, then the corn side, artichoke and margarita flatbreads, and all 3 pastas (rigatoni, penne, and ravioli)! The only dish that wasn't great was the eggplant parm. It had seitan in it that have it a weird texture and taste. . . Best thing on the menu: DEEP FRIED OREO DESSERT!! The batter taste a bit like a beignet with powdered sugar and of course the yum yum vanilla shake that comes with it! Eat it right away while it's still hot!
MEATBALLS!! That's all you gotta know about Lavo (the restaurant) . . Staying at the Palazzo means having an array or restaurants to choose from. My friend and I wanted something convenient, Italian, with outdoor seating availability. We chose Lavo. . . We actually took quite a bit of time looking over the menu; having trouble deciding on a pasta dish, meatballs, or a signature dish.  Our eyes were definitely bigger than our appetites. After having decided on an order of Kobe Meatballs with Ricotta, Salmon Oreganto, and the Chicken and Mushroom Ravioli, we quickly had a change of heart.  The waiter gave us fair warning that the first two dishes would be sufficient, and boy was he right.  We cancelled the ravioli and ordered: . . Kobe Meatballs with Ricotta ($22): holy meatball.. this thing was ginormous! The waiter wasn't kidding around, this could easily serve 3-4 people; especially after serving us the complimentary garlic bread. The meatball was juicy and tender, although a bit salty for my taste (I am very senstiive to salty foods) but to anybody else I'm sure it's just the right amount of salty.  Perfect when paired with the garlic bread.  Definitely something I would come back for in the future. Hell, I'd even come, sit at the bar and order just the meatball.. . Salmon Oreganato ($29): this too was a bit on the saltier side. We honestly probably could have done without this had we known the garlic bread would be so filling.  The fish was pretty good, not too dry and very flavorful.  The cucumber nestled underneath the salmon helped balance the saltiness of the fish and was very refreshing.  . . 20 Layer Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake ($13):  This was quite a hefty-sized cake.  Pretty good bang for your buck if you're sharing among 4+ people.  Between the two of us, we barely made a dent.  It tasted like a peanut butter cup... and I LOVE peanut  butter cups.  I will say, I am not a fan of the chocolate shavings they put on the outside of the cake.. too crunchy and adds to the already over-sweet taste of the dessert.
Excellent food!! Colby meatball amazing. Definitely ho to this restaurant when in Vegas
Horrible service and horrible food. The seafood pasta was under cooked and had a very fishy taste. The chicken marsala tasted like chicken teriyaki from a cheap Chinese restaurant. Worst chicken marsala ever!!!! Do not eat here. Even their bread came out cold with their cold red sauce for dipping.
Too many great places to go, would NOT recommend. Food wasn't anything great, very pricey.  Meatball was ok, wait staff was off and on. Disappointed. And wish I would have gone elsewhere. Don't think this restaurant has the class for this hotel!!
I've traveled a great deal for work and have been a part of many restaurant openings. I have frequented Lavo, Las Vegas, Nv. about 10 or more times. . On half of those occasions I witnessed staff treating patrons as "second class" to other staff members. One instance I witnessed a girl had fallen down their step stairs in the club. They escorted her out, accused her of being drunk and banned her. . . In the restaurant one evening a patron was leaving when he was run into by someone running down the stairs. I heard the patron say as he pushed him off, "Watch where you're going." A fair response. The other person took an aggressive stance and threatened the patron. As it turns out the other person was an employee. . . I have never cared for the attitude at a business that the customer is there for the benefit of the employee.
