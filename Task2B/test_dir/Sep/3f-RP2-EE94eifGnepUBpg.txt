Just an ok show. Not worth the time and money!. A live band would have been better otherwise we could just stayed home and listened to our CDs. . Lots of dancers and I guess they tried to describe the songs, but they look so disorganized on stage!
There were few parts that I liked but I wasn't so entertained in general. Hopefully the other shows are better
Fantastic show, of course. . . Go for the Beatles. Don't go for a cirque show. Little to no cirque culture or jaw dropping stunts incorporated into this show. It is mainly just a bunch of performers dancing to Beatles songs but damn is it entertaining. Seeing the songs come to life is really inspiring. . . This show is a Vegas bucket list item for sure. I know many people who see it multiple times from different seats for a new perspective (360* stage).
This was one of the best shows I've ever seen. The music, the light show, the performances were all 5 stars. We got our tickets late and were up in the highest part of the theater and even those seats rocked. That is my favorite part of this show, no matter where you sit you are going to see a great show. You can't say that about every cirque show.
It's starting to become a mission of mine to check out all the different Cirque Du Soleil shows now.. . I got introduced to these shows not too long ago and ever since I watch my first ever show maybe 2 years ago, I'm hooked! I've been wanting to see The Beatles show for some time now so we decided to score some tickets on our last Vegas trip.. . Upon walking into the theatre, I seriously loved the psychedelic runway into the entrance!! It was all very '70s! We got the lowest priced tickets were in the seating area c or d. They were only $70 so we didn't really care where we ended up seating. However, when we arrived inside, they moved us closer to the stage because they were some empty seats in the theatre! Score!. . One thing I absolutely loved about the The Beatles show was the way the theatre is set up. The stage is right in the center and the seats are surrounded around the stage al wherever you're sitting you're going to get a good view. Even if you the balcony seats you're going to be able to see the stage pretty well. I actually recommend getting the seats a little bit further up bc sometimes the acrobat will be up in the air and you won't be able to see them sitting so close to the stage. . . The show itself was pretty good. They focus more on the songs and the themes of each song than they do for stunts and tricks. I admit the other Cirque shows had way more impressive stunts but I really enjoyed watching them perform to some of the old Beatles classics.. . If you're a Beatles fan you're going go absolutely love this show. It does a good job on representing each song and doing justice by adding some creative and impressive choreography to each song.
My 4th time in Vegas but this was my first show in Vegas, second cirque de soleil (first one was in New York). One word, wow! I enjoyed it very much last night, the acts was amazing and the costumes were fantastic with very great details involved. They really used the venue space well and were very creative with the props and the design. It was really amazing how they put the whole show together. Hard to put in words but you will understand when you've seen it. Didn't matter where you sit as they designed it well for everyone to enjoy it. So don't waste money on the better seats. It was very unique and I was bopping along the entire time to the Beatles music and was at the edge of my seat the whole time. Really worth it!!
Great show! So much talent in one room. We sat a little high up but I don't think there's a bad seat in the house
We chose this show for two reasons - Cirque and The Beatles.  . . First: Cirque - we saw La Nouba in Orlando and have been Cirque lovers ever since.  We have bought merchandise (posters, CD's, DVD's, masks, etc.) and visited several shows.  You normally can't go wrong with Cirque.  They are extremely passionate about their product.. . Second: The Beatles - The greatest music for a single band of all time.  No other band has the depth of catalog.  The Beatles/Cirque partnership was one we were looking forward to experiencing.. . The review:  Our experience began with the entrance ... the rainbow floor, the Fab Four on the wall.  The anticipation was awesome.   The "Hard Days Night" drink purchased prior to the show was incredible.. . Our seats - I splurged for Gold Circle seating (the most expensive theyhave).  I was hoping it brought an advantage - great view, becoming part of the show, or something for almost $200 per seat.  These seats offer leg room but nothing else.  Leg. Room.  We were disappointed.  . . The show - Again, we are experienced Cirque patrons.  This performance was more dance show than acrobatic/athletic.  Dance would have been fine if that was what we were expecting, but we were expecting more.   Great interpretation of the music, but overall we did not feel our experience was worth the money.. . Th Cirque experience and brand is phenomenal but this show didn't measure up.  Others enjoyed this much more than we did, but they didn't spend as much money ... that obviously was not Cirque's issue and was clearly on us.  We won't likely spend that much for seats in the future because our expectations could not be met.  . . We recommend visiting other Cirque shows in Vegas.  We will during our next visit.
I cannot say enough wonderful things about this show! I have seen it twice now and cant wait to go back and see it again! If you are a beatles fan, this will not disappoint! Every seat in the theater is a good one so do not worry about missing out if you purchase seats in the cheaper sections.
I've been to the Beattle's Love show. To be honest, I'm not a huge fan. The first time I saw the show, I fell asleep. It might have been because I was super tired or it might have been because it's just not my cup of tea. I am not a fan of the Beattle's music. The second time I watched the show, I did not fall asleep, but I did not enjoy it. It is a cirque du soleil show so there are many cool aspects t the show. They do have the usual acrobats. There were acts that were impressive, but if you don't really like the background music, then you won't really enjoy the show. . . The show did a great job with relating the Beattle's music with the different events going on in the world during that time period. They do have huge projectors. The best place to view them in my opinion is going to be section 209 or section 200.
The best in my opinion
Scored a free complementary ticket with the purchase of one from myVegas slots! It works, upload the ap and play! For a Sunday night 9:30pm it was packed and a full house. Ok, so I'm not from the Beattle era ( Ithink I knew two songs) but the overall performance of the show was, ok. I have definitely seen better Cirque Du Soleil shows (La Reve, Ka, Michael Jackson One) which I thought were much more entertaining, but it could be because I didn't witness the upcoming of the Beattles first hand? Don't get me wrong, people around us loved it, standing ovations and all I just wasn't feeling it as much as expected. There's not really anything specific that I could even point out that was extremely cool and I guess that says it all in itself. Definitely would not go see this show again, maybe with my Mom if she wants to go.  The theatre is pretty small, the stage effects were cool, but overall I would give this show a B-.
what a really fun show!  It was really well paced and had a great selection of Beatles music.  The story line runs you through the decades.  The use of multi-media is really great and any seat in the house would be an incredible show.  it's a circular stage so there is stuff going on everywhere - it's hard to know where to look!!. . I thought the Cirque stuff was a little less insane than some of their other shows.  don't get me wrong - stunning and fun to watch but it didn't seem as over the top/awe-inspiring as some of the others I have seen when it comes to the athleticism and "never before seen" type stuff.. . But the show was packed with a great story, amazing costumes, graphics, dancing, etc., and I loved every minute of it!
The best show that my parents and I experienced during our 5 day stay in Vegas!. First of all, I was amazed at an employee that helped us find our seats. This gal Leland was her name, could see that my mom was struggling to walk the steps to the third floor balcony. She immediately contacted her supervisor to see if there were 3 seats on the ground floor. She went above and beyond her job... She was so empathetic to us and never did my mom feel like a burden but a guest to the show. Leland is the kind of person who any company wants in management! She found us tickets to the ground floor, didn't accept a tip, made us feel that it was her duty to help us! She alone was worth more stars than I could give! . The show was spectacular! The music was fabulous! The performers were so talented and so perfect! The Costumes, the skills of the dancers, the acrobats, the crew to make the show come to life, the genius of it all was mind blowing. I can't stop thinking about it! You have to see this one!
I've seen 6 or 8 Cirque shows and this one takes the cake!  Fun,  exciting, great music, venue is awesome. There isn't a bad seat in the house.
Words cannot describe. AMAZING! Best Cirque show I have EVER seen. Highly recommend!. . We had just had our nuptials and to celebrate, I chose this show. (Pats self on back). We were sporting our wedding attire. The crowd greeted us with congratulations and asked us to kiss--we did. . . My husband had never been to a Cirque show prior. Hands down it was the BEST show he has ever seen. (Yay for me and my choice--in both my husband and this show) His favorite band is the Beatles so it was a total win-win.. . There is NO bad seat in the house. We did not go cheap on tickets nor did we go all out. We had a great view of everything. My mouth was open the entire time in awe (he sang every song out loud).. . If you are thinking of taking in one Cirque show...see Love. You will have a wonderful time!
AMAZING!!  Best show on the strip!!  I didn't realize how many Beatles songs I actually liked until the show.  It was one incredible acrobatic feat after another which is no surprise for Cirque but add the music and the story of Beatles it all came together as the most impressive Cirque show I have ever seen. ("O",Mystere,LaNouba,KA) this is a MUST see on the strip.  Make reservations at FIN for pre show dinner- it's pretty good and right outside of the theatre.
I felt every emotion during this show. I don't think you would even have to be a Beatles fan to get into it. Well worth the money!
Just saw the show on 9/27/2014. It was great from beginning to end. Do not be late as it starts on time like all Cirque du Soleil shows. But, this show is not like the rest of the Cirque shows. There aren't a lot of acrobatics or death defying stunts. There's more dancing, acting, and comedy and it flows more like a musical. The costumes, props, and sets fit the music soo well. It's very hippie 60's and the set designs I think are meant to make you feel like you're high and hallucinating. Everything is soo colorful and some of it is really weird but somehow goes with what's happening on stage. The music of course was great and was so much fun to sing along to. They have speakers built into the seat's head rest which makes the experience even better. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was my favorite. . It's a great show for those that want to see something a little different than what Cirque du Soleil usually does. And there isn't a bad seat in the house since it's not a huge venue like "KA." Even the ones that are 'obstructed view" were not obstructed at all.
