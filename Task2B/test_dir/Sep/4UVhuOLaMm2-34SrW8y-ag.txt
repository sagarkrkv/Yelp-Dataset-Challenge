Warning! Japanese Fave Ichiza Shut Down Yet Again by SNHD - this is the ninth time!!!   Chef's favorite Ichiza did it again. The Japanese izakaya at 4355 Spring Mountain Road was shut down Sept. 2 for the ninth time since 2008 by the Southern Nevada Health District with 50 demerits.  http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2014/09/05/japanese-fave-ichiza-shut-down-yet-again-by-snhd.php
This is an absolutely authentic Japanese restaurant. No pho, no fusion, no frills. I ordered many items and none I'd had before, like rice in green tea with salmon or a cold bochoy and sesame salad. My friend and I also had the 5 Kinds sashimi and a variety of other dishes...and lots of sake I must confess. The only problem was I was too busy eating and enjoying myself to remember to take pictures.

Nom Nom this place was good.  We came here twice after long days of work, and it was a great place to refuel.  We really enjoyed what we ordered.. . The exceptional dishes were the Tofu and Sashimi Salad and the Wagu Beef and Garlic Fried Rice.  The salad sounded like an usual combination to me, but my friend promised that it was good - and it turned out to be very delicious both times we ordered it.  The lettuce with the sashimi and tofu mixed with their dressing was perfect.  The other hit was the fried rice. It was nice and moist but not mushy.  The garlic chips were a perfect addition, and who doesn't like Wagu beef?. . We also had their sashimi (salmon and yellowtail) and an Spicy Eggplant and Shrimp dish.  All good. . . The only complaint is that it's difficult to see what to order if you've never been here before.  My friends knew what to get, but they have so many things written on random pieces of paper on the wall, and their menu didn't seem to have all the good things on it.  So a newbie with no friends with the inside scoop may rate this place lower because it's just so darn hard to spot the good stuff!. . This is, yet another, must-stop place for me on future visits!
Been in this plaza and ate at two other restaurants there, I'm surprised it took me this long to find Ichiza! The food here is sooo delicious. . . It was a little annoying to find consistent information about when they are open, their website (on the home page and the contact page) and yelp have different times listed. Their door says 5pm-2:30am with the last call at 2:30am. I guess this means they don't have happy hour anymore?. . I went with one other person, we sat at the bar. It's an open kitchen, so we can see what the chefs are doing the whole time. . . We ordered and shared:. beef tongue skewers. chicken yakitori skewers. crab meat fried rice. yellowtail tartar. tuna tartar. salmon sashimi. beef tataki. . Everything came out perfect. The tartar was so yummy, we had to order both the tuna and the yellowtail. The salmon sashimi was the best I've had thus far, it was so buttery and fresh. Our bill came out around ~$70 because we ordered two large beers, but it was definitely worth it for the quality. I'm probably going to come back here every time I'm in Vegas now.. . It's located in a small plaza with limited parking during dinner time.
So many delicious specialties: skewered chicken gizzards, savory egg custard, grilled whole squid, Kirin on tap, and I'm just barely scratching the surface here. Do yourself a favor and take a break from the overdone strip and hang out here one evening.
