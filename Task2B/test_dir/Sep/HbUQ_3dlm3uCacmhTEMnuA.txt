The service was amazingly wonderful, made reservations online and was seated within minutes of arriving there. The servers were very nice, answered all my questions and gave good advice on what to order for appetizers. Ordered a couple of appetizers. The hand-cut wagyu tartare, which was very good and never had anything like that before.  Ordered the NY strip medium rare and it was a bit plain and not cooked like a medium rare. Service was fast and got in and out of the restaurants relatively fast. Beautiful restaurant with a great table/chair setup, felt very comfortable and was not too dark for dinner time.
I'm not a big meat eater, but I do appreciate fine dining. Craftsteak is one of those restaurants that has a small menu, but makes sure that everything on themenu is perfected. . . In terms of steak, we ordered the porterhouse, ribeye, and filet. Out of all three I enjoyed the filet the most. So tender and melted in my mouth. For the other two meats, I really couldn't tell the difference. The texture and taste was similar for both, except the porterhouse came with a special sauce. . . We also ordered the potato puree, some kind of mushroom, the heirloom tomato salad, and the monkey bread for dessert. The potato puree WAS TO DIE FOR! Extra yummy mashed potatoes! The mushroom was just meh. You can probably tell my feelings towards it since I don't even remember what kind we ordered. I loved the tomato salad. Very fresh and light compliment to the heavy meat dishes. . . And finally, the monkey bread is something you have to try here. It's absolutely delicious, but it does remind me of a less sugary version of a Cinnabon. The banana ice cream was a nice touch to take away some of the sweetness of the decadent dessert.  . . . Fabulous service with multiple waiters. This is a given with the price tag you pay to eat here and with Mr. Colicchio's name hanging above the doorway. . . If you are a dedicated carnivore, this place will be a delight for you taste buds, but remember that you pay for what you get as this place is pretty pricey.
Wow! Food + Service + Atmosphere=The perfect night out!! I went here with a group of 10, and was surprised to get a reservation within a few hours on a holiday weekend! I had never been here before, but a friend suggested it would be the perfect place to get a nice meal. Boy, was he right (don't EVER tell him I said that)! We ordered the chef's special for the 10 of us. It started with salmon, scallops, and five different salads. Next was the wagyu steak...it included perfectly cooked ribeye, filet, strip and skirt steak. Yes, I said perfectly cooked skirt steak...it's possible! We also got perfectly cooked Japanese eggplant, risotto, fries, pureed potatoes (server even provided extra...we will get to him in a little bit). We were stuffed, and still had dessert coming! Holy monkey bread!! It was covered in caramel,and baked to perfection. Also served, was fresh fruit, chocolate mouse, blueberry creme brulee (more like a tart if you ask me), and multiple scoops of sorbet (pistachio was my fav)! This place was to die for and definitely a win for any foodie.. . Now onto atmosphere and service. One thing I liked about Craftsteak was the variety of people. There were couple enjoying a romantic dinner, but still areas for big groups! Kevin was our server and he definitely is doing the business well. He immediately convinced all of us to order the special, was knowledgable about the menu, and let's be honest anyone that can deal with my group for a few hours is ok in my book! Kevin took care of us and was friendly and professional. . . I'm definitely going back!
Bad experience with a very rude server. Manager was great and offered to take one of the entrees off the meal- then offered us a round of deserts- which was very generous - but it still ended up being very expensive for a less than pleasurable experience. Food was really good but not amazing like we heard. Kudos to the Manager- but when you still pay $300 for a bad experience- I have to give them a 1.
We came with no reservations and set at the bar. The food was amazing. The bartender was very nice and professional. She recommended us to share a steak since the portions are big, we did and we didn't even finish it. It was very nice of her (since the place is not cheap..). The wine was delicious.. Overall very nice place.. We had fun!
Nestled in a corner of the MGM Hotel and Casino sits this fine dining steak establishment. . . In Vegas on a business trip, my colleagues and I had dinner here and were quite pleased.  Our server, Joe, had his hands full with our bunch (9 of us) and he handled it like a champ.  Cocktails and appetizers were served with promptness, making the hungry patrons happy. I chose the organic lettuces salad and hamachi. The salad was lightly coated with a lemon vinegarette and pleasing as well as cleaning to the palate. The hamachi was perfect!. . My main course was the 10 oz filet (the smallest you can order unless you order surf and turf). I cannot recall having a steak cooked more perfectly. It could have been cut with a butter knife. . . And for dessert, I enjoyed a mixed fruit bowl which included a selection of berries, melon and my favorite....fresh fig. . . I have already begun suggesting this place to friends and other colleagues.
hmmm. what can  I say? it was definitely tasty. atmosphere takes the stars down. I expected a little more swank and a little less shorts and frat crowd. that's all I can say..... Location was in the MALL - had I realized this, I would not have made the reservation. Service was pretty good, and food was as expected. I won't rush back to this place.
The dry aged (non wagyu) ribeye served at Craftsteak is in a class of its own. Prepared as simply as possible and not uber salty like other steakhouses.
Got porterhouse for 2, lobster, lobster bisque. Sides included  risotto, potaots au gratin, spinach and corn. . . I didn't love the steak. The lobster and lobster bisque were amazing. Sides sans spinach were awesome.. . I've been to Heritage and thought it was a lot better. . . If I had to go to Craft again I would try the Wagyu.
Just ate here last night......it was awesome. Ribeye was cooked to perfection. Sides were- grits, squash, corn as well as the Caesar and Arugula salad. Had the monkeybread for dessert as well, everything was great. I liked it better than Old Homestead.
We eat here last week. Second time for me. This time our steaks were not hot . When we shared that with them,. No apologies just OK we take take them. Back and warm them up . Second time around still not hot ! Manager then checked in and asked is how the " flavor of everything was" like he really did not want to know , we eat At lots of great Restaurants . If you want a great steak there are many better choices in Vegas than here.
I was excited to try this place,  but unfortunately, it fell short for me. To start, the restaurant itself is nice, but unfortunately we were there on a Friday night and got seated in the back at a large round table that made me feel like I was at a conference room having an expensive meal.  The food was presented well, but was just ok. The cocktails were not great...lacked flavor (other than the taste of hard liquor) and looked boring.  The only positive at this place was the staff.
We were a party of 12 and we had the Chef's Beef Selection for 10 . It is served family style. We started with the shrimp cocktail for the table and several salads we enjoyed the Baby bibb buttermilk blue cheese with bacon. (reminded me of a wedge) and we loved the Italian buffalo mozzarella, wild arugula and roasted baby beets. Our meals had 24 hour short rib, rib eye, NY strip, flat iron , hangar and filet mignon. These were accompanied by asparagus, sweet corn, Japanese eggplant, mushroom assortment, potato puree, risotto (snap peas, prosciutto, scallions) and white corn grits. Just when you thought you were on food overload they brought out all the desert. cinnamon monkey bread, soft chooclate cake creme brulee tart and assorted sorbets.. The deserts were not as good as the meals. If you go as a group I would recommend the chef tasting vs a la carte we had plenty of food and were able to taste alot of different meals. Staff was attentive and had good suggestions.
the ambience, decor, and the staff are excellent. I've had a couple fine dining experiences and this one was magnificent. I love cooking and I think I can do steak pretty well but what I love about what they offer here is they give me a product I can't make myself and my was it delicious. you're definitely in for a treat
We went to craft steak mainly because I had Ka tickets and wanted to eat some place close. Craftsteak fit the bill. Plus it came highly recommended from a few co-workers so we decided to try it. We had 6 pm reservations. When we checked in, we were immediately seated. The ambiance was elegant and quiet, perfect for a fancy dinner. We decided we weren't going to stuff our faces too much so we skipped the appetizers. I ordered the surf & turf with scallops and an 8 oz filet mignon. The steak was perfectly cooked and so tender but still retains its "beefiness." The scallops were exceptional. Not over cooked and served with a lemon butter sauce. My friend and I split a side of risotto. I still dream of that risotto. Very rich and heavy with peas and prosciutto. Part of me wanted to stop eating my streak and just eat the risotto. . . Service here was excellent as you would expect from Mr. Colicchio. And the other thing worth raving about is the bread! Salty, sweet, bread. This restaurant far exceeded my expectations.
Great ambience but the food doesn't cut it.  The only thing that was pod was the free dinner rolls that were buttery and had sea salt on top to offset the sweetness.  . . Got the $55 ribeye that came luke warm and under seasoned.  By far the worst ribeye I've ever had at a nice steakhouse.  It was full of fat too.. . The risotto was horrible.  Sour like something we bad and it came with huge cherry tomatoes, very unrefined.. . Short rib was delicious, highly recommended.  Scallops were just whatever and the carpaccio was good, savory and worth trying.. . Service was excellent minus out main server.  He didn't do much but the other help was amazing.. . Monkey bread was recommended so we tried it.  Very very very sweet, too sweet.  I y thing that was good was the banana ice cream but I wouldn't get this of you for like your deserts too sweet.. . Overall, it was a bad steakhouse.  Skip it
Came here to celebrate our anniversary and had high hopes since we've heard great reviews for the LA location. The restaurant was decorated nicely with classy decor. Our booth felt private and overlooked the rest of the tables. . . The service was somewhat spotty. The hostess was pleasant, our main waiter was nice but seemed to have disappeared toward the end of dinner. The guys who brought our the food were very nice and attentive.. . Appetizers:. 1) sea scallops- came with 3 large scallops which were perfectly cooked; however the taste was lacking. It had a very light lemony butter taste but it just didn't stand out. I would not order this again.. . 2) wagyu tartare- this was one of my favorites. Delicious and flavored just right. Came with plenty of crostini to spread that delicious meat on. If you like tartare- try it!. . 3) rib eye steak- very big disappointment!! It was more than $50 and came lukewarm. Seasoned and cooked well but the temperature really killed it. It was also way too fatty and we had to cut large chunks of fat out to eat it. I love my fat but it wasjust too much.. . 4) braised short ribs- this was very flavorful and tender. I wish it came with some sort of starch to balance it out. Eating this by itself was a bit too salty and it was difficult to eat a lot of it.. . 5) risotto side dish- I really liked this one with red corn, prosciutto and cilantro. Great flavors and risotto cooked just right!. . 6) monkey bread for dessert- got this because of all the fantastic reviews. It cane warm and soft but way too sweet for my taste :(. . Overall it was an extremely pricey meal for subpar food. I'm disappointed Tom!
