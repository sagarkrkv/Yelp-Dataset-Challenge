Arrival date: 08/01/2014 Departure date: 08/02/2014 . Room Type: Resort King . Special Requests: .  Guaranteed Late Check-Out . Number of Guests: 2. . This is supposed to be a member of the Leading Hotels of the World and a Five Star/Five Diamond Resort. I have been to the Bellagio plenty of times, but during this visit I did not expect this. I was repeatedly insulted, screamed at and called out to a confrontation by an assistant manager. And worse I was thrown out like a dog out of my room for no reason. . . I had a complimentary two day stay at another Five Diamond Resort and I decided to stick around in Vegas for a while longer because my check out from the other resort was on a Friday.  So, I booked a room at the Bellagio. I booked the basic king size standard room and I paid an additional fee of $30 dollars for a guaranteed check out, or so I thought..  . I arrived early and I do not know the exact reason why I was upgraded to a suite, and I was reassured that my upgrade would not affect my late check-out. I decided to do what I came to do, which was play the table games. I played for almost five hours and gave a very generous donation to the Casino in the end. The drinks took their toll on me and I needed time to recuperate from my fatigue and I have insomnia issues as well, for which I take strong sedatives to sleep. That is the reason why paid for a guaranteed late check out because I just can't get up half way through my sleeping cycle.. . It was approximately 10:53 am when my wife called the M-Life Desk to inquire about any comps for my play the previous evening. M-Life made my wife aware that they had me in their system checking out at 11:00 am. My wife woke me up and told me what they had told her and I told her perhaps they had made a mistake because I paid the fee to check out at 3pm and that the front desk would know better.. . My wife spoke a front desk staff member and they did not provide her an explanation and told her that we had to check out immediately. That is when I took control of the situation and asked to speak for a manager. I was transferred to a manager named "Jay" and he told me that I had to exit the suite immediately because housekeeping was outside ready to clean it and that I had to leave immediately.. . I asked Jay if he was the General Manager and the highest authority in the hotel, and he told me that he was. Jay came off the bat with a rude tone and disrespectful tone. I pleaded with Jay and advised him that I had paid for the "guaranteed late check-out". Jay screamed at me and told me to exit the room at 11 am or that he would have security come and kick me out of the room. I once again pleaded my case with Jay and he told me that the hotel was at high occupancy and that he needed me out NOW!. . I asked jay for time for me to pack my belongings and leave because I was being threatened to be kicked out of the room I had paid for by security. Jay advised me I had a 20 minutes to get out because once again, housekeeping needed to clean that room NOW!. I told Jay that this was "bad costumer service" and for him not to speak to me in such a way because I was the guest. Here's when everything took and unexpecting turn for the worse. Jay the 'self-proclaimed' highest authority in the hotel begins to scream at me in a very loud and disrespectful tone. Jay's reply was "Service!!!?"... "I AM NOT YOUR SERVANT!!!" At this point, I was afraid and shocked by the way I was being treated in such a prestigious hotel by a manager. Jay was out of control, and I felt that no one would believe such an account of events. I began recording the conversation because this Jay fellow was out of control. Jay humiliated me by telling me that I am just a "Pearl" member and that he doesn't have to offer me much. He was very rude and sarcastic and unprofessional.. . I then spoke with someone from M-Life who connected me to the assistant of the real hotel manager, Mr. Hamlet. The assistant that I spoke with was named was Connie. Connie spoke with me over the phone and told me that everyone at the Bellagio is a VIP regardless because we are guests. I then invited Connie to listen to the conversation that I had with Jay. We began in the computer room for guests, and Connie said that regardless of what was said and what happened the costumer was always right. However, she told me that Jay had been honest about raising his voice towards me and being bothered by him being called a servant. Connie was somewhat defensive of Jay because she advised me that no one likes to be called a servant. . Here is the link to the conversation with Jay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxpynOBJzLg&feature=youtu.be
This hotel is wonderful! hands down, beautiful architecture, and a great water show! Everything is extremely clean, the location is amazing, as it is literally located near the center of the strip. At night time, they play the water show in front of the fountain. Although there is a set schedule for the showing, its never really gone off on time... Also, if youre exiting the hotel, dont bother to sit at the ramps and make sure you arnt leaning towards the guardrails!! There have been huge trails of ants which is insane (hopefully they fixed this issue). The staff overall was very professional, which is nothing less expected from a Five Star Five Diamond Resort.
We paid for extended check out at 3 pm but were surprised to be locked out of our room at 11:20 for an odd reason. It took security over an hour to come up and let us back into our rooms. There is absolutely no reason for a computer system to automatically check someone out when they were told by multiple people beforehand that the extended check out was in place.
The casino is beautiful, though the room we got was mediocre. Soap scum on the shower head, and bath tub faucet, cigarette burn on the bed sheets, and a suspicious stain was found on the bench at the end of the bed (gross). I stay at a lot of hotel chains for my job, and I would say I have stayed at nicer rooms through Best Western. This was my first trip to Vegas, and I would have never imagined that somewhere as prestigious as the Bellagio would have had this many problems. . . The manager was very agreeable however, and waived some of the charges, and also offered to set us up with something 'nicer' the next time we come. I give 3 stars for how well the manager handled my complaint, though I doubt that we will be coming back anytime soon.
We booked the Bellagio because we had been impressed with the garden area andgeneral grounds on previous trips to Vegas.  Unfortunately, the room was not near the same level as the public areas. . . We stayed in room 25099, which has several issues:  the air conditioner does not work effectively, even when set at 60 degrees; there are two chips on the toilet seat; the caulking in the shower on the inset shelf was peeling off; the housekeeping did not come even though we did not have the privacy sign on our door; the furniture in general showed signs of wear; and the linens were low quality.  Also, I had noted on the reservation that it was my husband's birthday, and they didn't do anything special at all.  . . The pool was nothing special, which was surprising to me given the higher-end image Bellagio portrays.  . . The check-out process was lengthy, and I was unable to express checkout due to a linked reservation.  They should probably have more staff at peak checkout times, as there were a lot of people in very slow lines.  . . On the plus side, I forgot my razor, and the concierge sent us some disposables for me.  . . We will definitely not return to the Bellagio, as there are many other options on the strip.
amazing free  gym!
Had a three-night stay here with the GF to celebrate our six months together. Since watching "Ocean's Eleven" as a kid, I remember dreaming of staying at the Bellagio someday - in large part because I wanted to walk around and utter that cheesy Andy Garcia line - "In my hotels, there's always somebody watching" - to anybody that would listen.. . We got a really killer deal on our mid-August stay - thanks in part to the GF's discount through AAA. In comparison to other standard room rates that we had been scouting out (Wynn, Cosmo, etc.), the Bellagio offered the best bang-for-the-buck. . . Unfortunately, due to some awful traffic on the way into Vegas (go figure, it was a Friday), we didn't arrive at the Bellagio until around 9 PM. Surprisingly, the check-in desk was still completely slammed with people - but it's a ton of fun to people watch! The lady and I had a ton of fun seeing who could count more Rolexes and Cartier LOVE Bracelets among the crowd of folks trying to check-in.. . We were given a room on the fifth floor of the Spa Tower, on the non-fountain side. I'm not sure if the floor really matters when you're on the side of the hotel that isn't facing the Strip; perhaps this was a slight on the hotel's part (due possibly to how young my girlfriend and I look/are), but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.. . The room itself oozed sex appeal and a sense of contemporary edginess. Being that I never got the chance to stay at the Bellagio prior to its big renovation, I can't comment on how much of an upgrade this facelift provided. What I can say is that the room's beautiful indigo trim and wood furnishings gave off a very "new school Vegas" feel. The free wifi, - which was very reliable and lag-free - was also an excellent touch. The wall-mounted flat screen was surprisingly large for a standard room, and families will be happy to know that the setup accommodates video game systems. The real star of the show, of course, was the much-hyped Bellagio bed. While I won't delve into details, I'll point out that I had little trouble getting a good night's sleep on this fluffy cloud of a bed - no matter what state I was in!. . All this being said, there were little things about the room that detracted from these otherwise-perfect accommodations. The glass door to our shower didn't close all the way; its rubber hinge seemed to get caught in the marble doorframe. As a result, tiny puddles of water would start to accumulate outside the shower if we forgot to place on the ground. . . Also, it's a shame that standard Bellagio resort rooms are equipped with such spacious mini-fridges/freezers - yet these same fridges provide no extra space for guests' food/drinks (because they're filled to the brim with minibar items). Thus, this creates some problems if you're bringing home leftovers from a meal. It sorta felt as through the drive to make a profit seemed to supersede a potential opportunity to offer guests a welcome - and very practical - accommodation. I'm not sure if this is standard practice on the Strip, but I was nonetheless surprised.. . Between going out to Hakkasan within an hour of arriving in Vegas and making two visits to Marquee (Dayclub & Nightclub) the following day, my girlfriend and I knew that we'd need to stay somewhere where we could take a break from the action. Thankfully, Bellagio provided that welcome sense of cleanliness and serenity that we had been hoping for. In spite of the fact that the hotel's clientele was (on average) about a generation older than my GF and I, I seldom felt as though we were out of place at Bellagio. In fact, it was kind of refreshing being able to make our way back to the hotel after a long night of clubbing and have an empty Conservatory to drunkenly wander through. . . (^ I'd highly recommend giving that a try, by the way; a walk through a tourist-free Conservatory is breathtakingly serene, and a visit during peak hours does not compare in any way whatsoever.). . Where the hotel really won me over was with the little customer service touches that made our stay so memorable. From chatting about my last trip "back home" with a fellow Filipino who delivered our bags to our hotel room, to being greeted with a big smile from the Newsstand (general store) clerk on the three separate times that we ventured into her shop to buy chasers, I never felt that "cooler-than-you" attitude that I sometimes encounter when indulging in the finer things. I appreciated the staff's down-to-earth attitude and consistent cheer. Hell, even from the guards manning the elevator lobby greeted us with a smile and a pleasant "good morning" towards the end of our trek back from Hakkasan.. . In spite of the fact that we stayed in a standard room, my girlfriend and I felt very much at home in the Bellagio. Once we finally manage to recover from the financial gut-punch of our past Vegas weekend, we'll set our sights on our next trip - and chances are likely that the Bellagio will be playing a major role!
Came here for family vacation, not my first time in Vegas.  First try at checking in they told me I can't check in since the room was in my dad's name.  I said my name was on it too, but was refused service.  I told her I had two confirmation numbers, one for my dad's room and one for mine and the one for me had my name, but she refused to look at my paper because she said "I could have printed it out anyhwere"  I got back in line and talked to someone else, and surprise they said I could check in, so the first woman was not only rude, but wrong.  . . Before leaving after our stay, they had some construction up, and hotel "security" workers trying to manage people for safety reasons. Hotel worker "Michael" calls my family "You people", singles us out to block our movement while other people are allowed to pass, then when my dad tries to move he shoves him in the chest.  We complain to the head of security at the Bellagio, and get a pretty shitty apology, and told there isn't much that can be done other than an internal review.  I don't think any hotel workers should be able to put hands on a customer and shove them.  . . Pretty much a terrible experience from start to finish.  Would not stay here again.
Though I prefer to stay at the casino-free Four Seasons down the strip, the Bellagio surprised me with its newly refurbished rooms and pretty darn good service. The fitness center is large enough for a hotel of this size, which is important at 6am when everyone and their mother wants to get a run in before their first meeting. Of course one of the big draws to the Bellagio is its exceptional location. Primo strip real estate. Also, I have to admit, listening/watching the fountain show from your room is pretty cool.
My husband and I along with his family were walking around after an awesome lunch at Noodle no. 9 and came back to the Bellagio to go hang out at the Bellagio Cafe for a little while before heading out to the airport to catch our flights back home. As we were walking through the lobby of the Bellagio, they were taking down their garden ornaments, and there was places that were cut off and two men who were security funneling and stopping traffic through roped off areas that people were walking in and out of.. . As we were walking through the tall man said to us "Do YOU PEOPLE not understand when a man tells you to stop that you have to stop?!" -- to which I didn't ever remember the other guy telling us we had to stop, and if he did it was an honest mistake as I was at the front of our group and I wasn't particularly feeling too well as I was a bit anemic at the time. He continued to be rude to us as I walked past and I told him that he "didn't have to be so rude" and we continued onward. The use of the phrase "you people" particularly bothered me because my husband and his mother are Korean, and his younger sister is half Korean, while her father (my husband's step-dad) is a white male.. . Just the way the guy said it to us, and REPEATED it over and over again as we kept walking, each time more loud and more rude didn't sit well with me. So I scuttled ahead to find a place where I could sit down, because I was so upset at just how rude that guy was. People make honest mistakes.. if we walked through and the other guy told us to stop which somehow all 5 of us seemed to have not heard, then we would have apologized, and that should have been the end of it. We were all so upset with how this guy treated us, that we decided to head back to the hotel lobby and just leave for the airport -- well to do so, we had to go back where that guy was.. . As we were approaching people were allowed to walk through the pathway and we were going with the flow of traffic. He then stopped us again, even though people on the other side were being let through (like traffic on a two-way road) -- which made absolutely no sense. It was pretty clear that he was singling us out because of the indecent before hand. My husband's father told the guy that the situation was ridiculous, and continued to walk forward as people were still being allowed to walk through on the left side of us. Once he did that the "security guard" (as he called himself) physically put his hands on Jason's father and pushed him. My husband's father then told him that his actions were uncalled for and was physical assault to which the guard responded by pushing my husband's father further back with his chest and getting up in his face repeating that he was a security gaurd, and he had the right to put his hands on him and kept telling us to "look at the badge" meaning his name tag with his name Michael on it and where he was from - San Bernardino, CA. My husband's mother was appalled and told him to get his hands off of her husband, and the guy touched me telling me to get back even though I never even moved from my original position, nor did I try to even start a confrontation.. . We had done nothing wrong. We were on a FAMILY vacation in Vegas. None of us have ever been involved in any crimes, nor were we being aggressive in any manor. It was uncalled for and made for a horrible ending to our vacation.. . We then waited to file a complaint with the head of security, in which we got an apology -- but he said the manor would be looked into. And the more we had talked to him, the more it seemed apparent that they probably had other incidents happen with Michael. Unfortunately we weren't able to file a formal complaint on paper with the hotel as we had to leave to catch our flights back home.. . Not only that, but in the beginning of our vacation, my husband and I went to check into our room with our confirmation email printed out (which had 2 confirm numbers for each room that his father had reserved) and the lady at the check out desk told us that we couldn't check in because it was only under my husband's father's name -- although we told her we had ANOTHER confirmation number, that also had my husband under another room's list and the woman was rude and said "I don't care, that's only a piece of paper. It doesn't mean anything." and when we went to another teller, they were more than nice to hear us out and we were able to get our room.. . Other than those two incidents, we had nice clean rooms and had a good time otherwise. However since the security incident happened the way it did, never again will we be staying with the Bellagio....
Visited from Aug 29 - Sept 2 and had a great time! The previous two times I've been to Vegas were for business and I stayed at the Mandalay and  Excalibur. The staff and employees were so nice and accommodating! The people who took my room service orders literally had me laughing out loud on the phone. One day I went back to my room for a quick break and the cleaning lady was there. We had a great conversation on the sites in and around Vegas while she was cleaning. I really can't think of a better place on the strip to stay.   The room was very clean. I had a great view. I didn't smell cigarettes. It's an easy walk to the rooms and you have to show your card to get to the hotel elevators. One thing I do want to mention is that it was really hard to get dinner after 7. The lines for every single restaurant in the building(s) were WAY too long. There is no such thing as a quick meal, unless you plan on room service.  Oh and wi-fi sucked. Bring your own, or wait until you get on the strip and use your cells data plan.
Casino is great but the security in maroon blazers are very rude, they just stand there mean looking and when you ask a simple question like where can I wait for security to bring back the ID I misplaced he rolled his eyes and said , and I quote " wait where they told you to wait " well ... That was the problem the security on the phone just asked what color shirt I was wearing, the lobby is pretty big and it was packed so I just needed to know an exact location no need for attitude by a security.
Its nice but a bit overblown in that it is not as great as its reputation may have you think.  Definitely well appointed but the lay out of the casino and the restaurants leaves a little to be desired.  Of the casinos in Las Vegas, it is not on my top 5 list.  Although, to stay there is nice and the restaurants are good.
Stayed 9/8, 9/9 for a conference.  Beautiful hotel.  Top notch.  King room was expansive, clean, and comfortable.  The Fiori di Como by glass sculptor Dale Chihuly is beautiful.  There's another Chiuly sculpture in the casino.  The fountain show is wonderful (f anything it is too short).  The shopping is cool, but expensive.  We learned about the monorail on our second day ... wish we had known about it earlier.  We wanted to visit the art gallery but ran out of time.. . The only concern is the air conditioning ... it IS Vegas, but the HVAC didn't make the room as cool as we wanted, but we weren't overly too hot.. . While here, visit Olives and Jean Philippe Patisserie.
I feel we were in one of the hotels in Atlantic City. It's very casino-hotel-feeling! Over-all, it was ok. We stayed for 2 nights.. played a little bit and went to the bar. Walked on the strip. It was fun. Had a great time! Hotel staff are courteous. Hotel is pricey... what would you expect a summer weekend nights?! Had fun though!
Overall decent experience. For a nice hotel, I do think it is lacking. The rooms are up to date but the bedding/mattress are lacking. Paid for and enjoyed a great fountain view so that was a plus. Bathroom was nice, nothing special, but the vanity faucets leaked when in the on position. Not sure I would return to stay, more likely to return to a newer more modern hotel like cosmopolitan (good experience and great view as well last year). Check in was a little hectic with no apparent organization in the lobby. If you want a great view of Vegas (if you pay for the right room) and decent accommodations, then you may like Bellagio.
Yes the hotel is nice and clean but this one star review is for how greedy they are.  You have to use a ice bucket to keep your drinks cold.  Yes they do have a fridge but it's completely full with there extremely overpriced drinks all on sensors.   You move it you get charged.  And the sign says it's for my convenience.   How is going down the long hall to get ice convenient to me?  Paying a couple hundred dollars a night you should be able to use part of the fridge.   Next time we are staying on Fremont Street.  Drinks and food is 1/4 the cost.
Excellent cirque du Soleil show. Very . poor help. Jonathan our photographer told us to come back anytime for our photos (which cost $45) the following day. We arrived at 1pm the following day and staff told us they wouldn't be ready until he arrived at 5:30p. Unprofessional, especially for a hotel of this stature. Do your job correctly.
Bellagio is a really nice, quiet and calmed hotel. the dancing fountain is phenomenal. I think is very expensive to stay here but it is in the middle of the strip. This hotel is more older people so its more quiet and calm.If you like a little more hype Planet Hollywood is the hotel.
I don't go to Vegas frequently , just once every a few years.. So when I go I like to stay in a nice hotel, because I do not gamble, I at least want to enjoy the hotel.. I was just disappointed how old the room looked and felt old and kind of dirty.. The good thing is that they are remodeling the hotel.
This is an absolutely gorgeous hotel. Every single detail is just wonderful. There's a lovely flower garden in the center of the lobby that changes every season. It is gorgeous for photos. I do with that they had an indoor pool or jacuzzi. I was a guest here during New Years and wasn't able to take a dip in the pool bc of the weather ... but then again, very few Vegas hotels have indoor pools. . The service is impeccable; you will be treated like royalty. . Eat at their restaurants and buffets; you won't be disappointed.
Beautiful Hotel, however they really rip you off with prices. If you have extra money to throw away, this is the place for you
Now in general I've spends multiple weekends at Bellagio and loved it which is why I've come back time and time again.  This last trip with my girlfriends left a bad taste in my mouth.  2 things.  When I packed up and went home, I realized that I had left a dress of mine hanging in the closet. I called Bellagio's lost and found.  I told them my room number, where i had left it and what it looked like down to the size. They told me nothing was left in the room and there was nothing in lost and found that resembled the dress. Disappointed, i left it at that. What can i do, I am more than positive that was the only place it could have been because it is no longer in my possession and I remember hanging it in the close next to the tv. . . Then I get a call from my friend who stayed in the same room as myself, she told me the following.  On checkout, we had sometime before our flight back to los angeles.  We then check our bags into the baggage deposit for a couple of hours. In my friends duffle along with her clothes and shoes was a small purse resembling an camera case.  When she arrived back home to unpack, the small purse was gone. The purse had a bit of money in it. My friend then called the Bellagio as well. She spoke to the Valet manager. They did not find it (not a surprise) and was told that it happens alot.  It happens ALOT?! That is not an acceptable answer. It should never happen esp when we stay at a 5 star hotel. That why we pay a higher rate because we believe it would be an honest establishment with out fear of theft to our belongings.. . So...pretty much I'm going to assume that my dress that i left hanging was taken(not put in lost and found) and my friend's purse that was hidden in her duffle was stolen purposely.  My friends and I are sorely disappointed and will probably stay at another casino resort for next get away.. . **Ive posted the same review in Tripadvisor
I have always walked around this hotel on each visitto Las Vegas - the corridors, shopping, etc are all great.  Everything is beautiful and well kept. The lobby and conservatory are a definite stop, especially during the holidays.. . On this past visit, I was able to attend a gathering at one of the penthouse suites, and I must say it's very nice!  The views of the strip and their fountain show are fabulous - you can even tune into the music from the suite to watch the show with it's full effects.  The suite comes with a living area, bar area and a bedroom.  Both the living area and the bedroom had the great view.  It will be fabulous to be able to stay in one of these suites in the future!
I love this place - I really do. Every time I come to Vegas, I have to make a stop at the Bellagio. Whether eating at Noodles, or the Buffet, or just walking around the grounds - it's always a great time!. . And of course, the fountain show never gets old!
Very well appointed hotel. They seemed to have missed nothing. I have stayed all over the strip and this is among the best. They truly manage to keep everything classy, including the gamblers. . . Rooms are simple and luxurious, but extremely comfortable.
I always park here when I have to walk on the strip and also check on the floral arrangements. I usually get parking on lower floors. Hotel is clean for the crown and the fountain is great. I have neverstayed here as its beyond affordable for me.
The Bellagio is one of my favorite Vegas hotels!  It is in a great location on the Strip, beautiful flowers, amazing Chihuly glass, excellent restaurants and comfortable rooms.  The staff is beyond professional and my stay went off without a glitch.
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! We have stayed there several times and I have no desire to stay anywhere else on the strip.  From the drive up it is impressive.  The Chihuly blown glass ceiling in the lobby is beautiful!!  We get a room facing the fountains every time and my wife will turn up the sound on the TV that is synched with the fountains and watch it every time if we are in the room!  I love the casino, the bars, the pools, the restaurants, the botanical garden, the spa and the fitness center!!  I have been in the others and it's just not the total package like the Bellagio.  If I want single deck black jack I can walk next door to Ceasars.  The Sports Book is the BEST as well.  They have the "O" theatre and the buffet is truly international and amazing!!  My favorite fine dining restaurant in Vegas is just through the Botanical Garden called Michael Mina and the best thing they have is the Lobster Pot Pie!!! Just wait for the presentation :) The Bellagio is all class and has my business for as long as it stays that way!!
Not a luxury experience.. . Booked one of the top suites. The VIP service was not courteous nor accommodating. Experience was not personalized to my needs. At no point do you feel pampered or catered to.. . Spa ethics are questionable, my mom was misled about the cost of a treatment and then forced to pay. This would never happen at a true luxury establishment.. . Casino is a zoo. Buffet is a joke (the food itself is not bad but generic) but long waiting lines even with the VIP pass diminish its appeal. The pool is mobbed.. . In short, this is a Wal Mart experience, not a luxury experience. If you smoke and like all you can eat buffets, you might enjoy it. In this case, get a regular room and it might be worth it.. . But if you want to be surrounded by people who are actually committed to serving you and are looking for a genuine luxury experience, try the Four Seasons Las Vegas.
I usually wouldn't do this, but the bellagio has plenty of reviews to offset this 1 star.  Hopefully it will still be considered with the utmost importance though!!  . . Dear Bellagio:  Fix your ventilation system.  I should not throw up because the smoke in the casino is that unbearable.  If every other casino on the strip can successfully remove the smoke, so can you!!
meh
What a disappointment of staying at #bellagio ! Thought this will be the most famous hotel in Vegas, it turns out to be theworst experience! The hotel room sucks and small, with the same price but lower, we got a way better room and view in #cosmopolation next door. Yet, the service is really really bad! We call and ask if we will have somewhere to microwave our food and can if we get folks and spoons, then I was being transferred from front desk to room service to dinning service, by the end we have been told that we need to pay for the folks and spoons! Last but not least, everything in the room is charged for money, no free water nothing is free expect the wifi, oh wait! We actually pay 28$ for wifi which is included in the resort fee! #theterribleexperienceever
