LOVE Cibo.Ambiance and amazing food :)
Pretty much the best pizza I've had in awhile. I ordered the Diovola under Pizze Rosse. Remember to get there early as you can as there is not much seating in there and can get super hot. Parking sucks as well.
I'm giving a 3/5 review because we had a great time its a fun place! beautiful terrace and good staff ! my only disappointment was the flavor.I was expecting to be the best because of the reviews and the photos, it wasn't memorable let me put it this way!The distribution of the  veggies on the pizza was clustered. An even distribution of the vegetable allow you to appreciated all the flavor.  Big story but this is a place that has a lot of potential and I am happy to see an  happy local business thriving!
Boyfriend and I went to this for date night. Such a cute and friendly enviroment! Highly recommend. However, we waited awhile for our waitress to reappear but she was super friendly and helpful! Loved this place!
Service was good, food was AMAZING. Also, the vibe of the place is very fun. Reminded us of Flagstaff. And considering the quality of food, the prices were reasonable. We were very pleased!
One of my new favorite pizza places.  People have been recommending this place since I moved Downtown, and I am glad I finally decided to take a few friends there for dinner.  The pizza did not disappoint.  The friendly, service oriented staff was happy to make recommendations and highlight some tasty choices on the menu.  I will definitely go back.  Only down side for a vegetarian - double check the menu descriptions (lots of prosciutto).
The best pizza and crepes.  i had the crepe with fresh fruit and ice cream. i'm not a big crepe fan, but I crave theirs.
What a wasted opportunity. Great location, one of the best patios in Phoenix and the opportunity for an authentic hand tossed French/Italian pizza ... The location and ambiance deliver, Unfortunately the food just doesn't. I had a great time. The service was good but the food was below average. I sampled three pizzas - all were bland - not bad - but not up to any reasonable expectation for a $16 personal pizza. The pesto salad was short on pesto and there are no draft beers available. The best part of the meal was the Lemoncello at the end   We deserve better Phoenix
I have nothing to say about the food because we did not get a chance to order any. Do not come here for service. . . After reading the rave reviews on yelp, my family and I decided to drive out to it from our hotel in Scottsdale. . . We obviously came for the pizzas, but were told that we would be unable to order anything from the "dinner menu" although both yelp and their menu stated that the lunch menu ended at 2pm, which is when we got there. Our waitress told us that those were both incorrect & if we had checked their actual website, we would see that it is actually 3pm (as if we weren't thorough in our research and must triple check). We explained to our waitress Erika that we were from LA California & if they would be able to make an exception. She said no, but upon further requests and asking to see a manager she left and did not return long enough for us to realize that service is clearly not a priority at this eatery.  . . My sister cleared the bill for the drinks and we left without a single apology or accommodation from the restaurant. Very disappointed.
Hands down my favorite pizza spot in Arizona. The margherita pizza is phenomenal. The whole basil leaves are a nice touch. I use to work right next door so we ordered from here frequently. Here are some items I suggest:. . -Meatballs. -Margherita Pizza (any pizza really). -Tuna Melt. . The ambiance is pretty neat at night. It's homey and cozy. One of my co-workers actually proposed to his wife here! . . Haven't had a chance to try the drinks yet but I hear they do a good job!
Handsdown the most delicious prosciutto sandwich I've ever had!  I came here for lunch and had the most delicious meal ever!  . They make their bread and it's so light and crispy- so worth the $$$ and trip!  My meal was about $9 for lunch.. . Staff was friendly and quick.  They even have valet for your car!  This place is a house turned into a restaurant.  Very clean and I would 100% recommend this place!  Can't wait to come back!!!!!  Might be my go to Friday lunch spot!  . . You won't be disappointed you came!
I love the outdoor dining, but feel a bit claustrophobic inside. Expect long wait times during peak hours (and potentially slow service), but the food is good and the staff is friendly. Based on the wait times when I've visited, I've only been twice. Both pizza's were delish.
Good food, loved the pizza and salads.  I'm definitely coming back! Cute place and awesome staff.  Ask for Shane!  :)
After so many rave reviews of this place, we decided to give Cibo's a try. In a nutshell - the most underwhelming and flavorless meal we've had in a very long time. We should have anticipated what kind of meal this was going to be, by the dirty side plates brought to our table.. . We had the Ostia salad - "Romaine hearts tossed with our homemade chick pea dressing, topped with oven roasted herbed croutons, shaved pecorino romano, crispy parsnips and black pepper." Our romaine lettuce was spoiled, and rotting, the dressing had absolutely  ZERO flavor, and the salad overall just generally lacked any flavor at all. We then had the Procida pizza -"Mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, asian pears, chopped arugula, goat cheese and black pepper." It wasn't bad, but it was just - eh. Again, lacked flavor. The goat cheese had no flavor whatsoever. . . Our service was fine, but the girl who cleared our plates was very unprofessional. We let her know (and showed her) our rotted salad leaves, and she just replied with - "Oh...sorry." That was it. Also, as she was clearing our plates, she put others' dirty plates on our table as she tried to stack ours. At that point, we knew our complaint was going to fall on deaf ears. . . We've been to just about every pizza joint in the valley, and this was subpar, to say the least. I have no idea what all the hullaballoo is all about. We will definitely not be going back, which is disappointing, because we truly had high hopes for Cibo's after all the amazing reviews.
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I have a gluten allergy and their gluten free pizza and crepes are the best in Arizona! I have never had a bad meal there. . They also have house made limoncello!
Appetizers - Good!. Wine - Even Better!. Pizza - Amazing! . Dessert - Banana Thing with Nutella on it! Whooop! Slam dunk on a perfect meal with my cousin and her two teenage sons with appetites unbelievable! . With only these few hours available to spend with my relatives, it was spent at Cibo, nothing could have been better time spentwith relatives, outside on a cool fall night of last year! Yep, experience was that memorable that I thought I should yelp about it!
Cibo is a great place to go!!. They have a large patio and indoor seating as well. Cibo has great appetizers such as the burrata.. It is a fun place to go for a dinner date or lunch with the girls. The pizzas are good and the crepes are amazing. Service was good. Love this place!
I was visiting from California, and only came to Cibo because it seemed like the only edible place (that had good reviews) in Arizona. The exterior was surprising, it was basically a house that was converted to a restaurant. Once you walk in you immediately feel at home. I also loved how all the awards or that they have won were placed on the wall. . . Now... on to the food. I ordered pizza, I got half Diavola and half Genova. The Diavola is Tomato sauce - mozzarella and spicy salame and the Genova was Mozzarella - basil pesto - onions - roasted potatoes and grated parmimgiano. Hands down the Diavola was probably the best pizza I have ever had in a restaurant. It is a must get! Now the Genova, was good but it could have been better. I've never had potato on my pizza before but I felt like they were a little undercooked. Besides that it was also really good and had good flavor. . . If you are visiting AZ then definitely go here, you won't be disappointed. I just hope they expand to San Diego!
I just couldn't wait to try this place out and I Heard how awesome it was.. We ordered a margarita pizza with anchovies on it, what they brought out was an artichoke pizza, they took that away and brought us a marinara pizza with anchovies on it.. No cheese or basil. I ordered the homemade roasted pork belly sandwich I think it was called after asking the waitress what her favorite dish on the menu was. It came out soggy she didn't offer ketchup or anything to put on the Fry's but I wanted malt vinegar her she provided it i'll sonic vinegar. Anyway I'm gonna give this place a benefit of the doubt and go back because it really was cool place that  has a good vibe to it.
Cibo is such a fun place to go for a delicious Italian dinner.  The setting is an old converted bungalow style house in a residential downtown Phoenix neighborhood.  There is complimentary valet parking (recommended).  The front of the restaurant is a large tree covered patio with twinkle lights glowing in the evening.  There is often live music outside on the weekends.  The wine selection is great and the servers are helpful in selecting the right wine to accompany your meal.  We always order the burrata as an appetizer followed by their amazing pizza, salad and the decadent Nutella crepes.  Our favorite pizza is the Diavola.  The meat is spicy and delicious.  Adding ricotta cheese to any of their pizzas is an option that just takes the pizza to a whole new level of yumminess!  Service is attentive and relaxed.  I highly recommend Cibo.  It would be a great place to take out of town visitors or to celebrate a special occasion.
I came here a few months ago and the atmosphere is fantastic! My girlfriend loved it. The pizza is very pricy but very authentic. We liked it... I do not remember the name of the pizza but it had truffle sauce and mushrooms on it... WOW. I definitely will be coming back.
Surprised I never wrote a review for Cibo but to be well fed with dessert and a bottle of wine for under $60 bucks you can't go wrong here.
Amazing place to eat some yummy pizza! The calzone is HUGE and mouthwatering good! Such a cute and romantic place, too. If the weather permits, you must sit outside. The lighting and live music really make your dining experience unforgettable. Really can't go wrong with this place! Looooove :D
