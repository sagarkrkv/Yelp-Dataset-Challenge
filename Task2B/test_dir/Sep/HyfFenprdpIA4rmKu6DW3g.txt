I can only think of one bad thing about coming here. The wait.. . Everything else, I truly enjoyed. Freshness of the food (mmm.. pan roast), entertainment from the servers and chefs (Dolores is hilarious!), and location (right next to the tables!). I'll keep coming back here every time I am in Las Vegas.
Attempting to be adventurous, my gf and I wondered off the strip to try this "restaurant' recommended by so many yelpers.  We took a cab that cost about $25.00 to the Palace Station Casino, where this little shingle is located.  Skepticism soon crept in as I observed that the "bar" sat no more than twenty people at any one time, and the casino interior appear outdated.  Still, we tried the combo pan roast to see what all the fuss was about, after standing on line for about an hour.  Both my gf and I were blown away by the taste of the pan roast.  Even at "mild", the food was full of herbs and spices set off a cascade of pleasure pumping neuro chemicals in our brains. Afterwards, we stuck around to play pai gow and two deck blackjack tables with $5.00 minimums.  The card play was extremely fun and definitely changed my view about the Palace Station Casino.
We came here on Labor Day at 12am and waited for 2 hours. The waitress said it would take 3 hours but we still didn't mind. There were about 10 parties ahead of us. Also, I didn't know this place was actually a BAR. It's surrounded by the slot machines and there areno tables. So everyone is sitting at the bar facing the cook and waitress.. . Oyster (half dozen) - $12. So fresh! They shuck the oysters to order and I saw them throw away oysters that aren't Oyster Bar approved. So it's nice to see that they care about the quality of their food. We were debating on getting the dozen since it was only $6 more. I regret not getting the dozen.. . Combo Pan Roast - $23. My husband and I shared and it was a perfect portion for us. The cook gave us 2 bowls of rice and didn't charge a split plate fee, which we thought they would. I think they just gave us less rice each. The shrimp was so great. It was not overcooked and just the way I liked it...a bit undercooked. The crab was shredded in the sauce which I don't prefer but it was still good and the lobster were in chunks.. . Service - Our waitress was so kind and fast! I forgot her name but she kept moving and serving everyone. I also saw the cook go around the bar to clean the table. I thought that was cool since you don't ever see that! Definitely a team oriented restaurant. The cook also joked around with us that they ran out of oysters.. . I'm from southern california and this reminded me of The Boiler in Chino Hills. Oyster Bar is a great find but it didn't amaze me as much as I had hoped.
Come heavily armed with patience. . . 2:30AM: tired, drunk, obnoxious, and hungry people standing around does not make for a pleasant 2 hour wait. There was only 1 cook and 1 waiter/busser/food runner working their asses off, and 1 other person not doing much other than clearing out buckets of dirty plates, attempt to shuck clams, failing, and then getting the cook to do it for him. It is only possible for 6 orders to be cooking at once, and each pot takes around 45 minutes to cook. Almost 3 hours have passed (T_T). Atthis point, we're just so tired and worn out that nearly nothing would be worth this long of a wait. . . To cap it off, while we were waiting for our orders to finish cooking, they reloaded their pots of gumbo base and pan roast base out front for everyone's viewing pleasure. Not quite something I wanted to see! The gumbo looked like minced up dog food and the pan roast looked like someone's vomit. . . Stick with the Combination Pan Roast. Imagine a seafood-loaded tomato soup with rice. The Etouffee was excessively salty and nearly inedible.. . All in all, Oyster Bar was not worth venturing off the strip for. However, if you do  decide to go, I recommend going at the beginning of your Vegas trip, when you may have more patience to wait for things.
Only had to wait about 30min-45min which made it a good experience and worth the wait.... . But...... . If I waited over an hour and a half I probably would have been disappointed.. . Yes the food is good, but of course a lot of prepping is involved to make the bar manageable by a cook, a server, and a "barback." In reality, this is quick dining, watch your food get assembled in front of you in a contraption not seen too often these days, and then slurp it down so the next group can get seated. It felt pretty rushed with the server and cook working as a team to keep those barstools turning, but I completely get it. It's not the type of place you'd go with a group of 6. . . We had the pan roast combo and bouillabaisse. Both were delicious and filled with seafood. I do wish I had asked for it spicier. My request for medium was barely a hint of spice. I must say the dinner roll they serve was delish! Menu was moderately priced. . . Would definitely eat here again, but definitely avoid prime time lunch and dinner.
There for my birthday, been here before and loved them,! But this time was very different left the strip of Las Vegas to come here for my birthday dinner that shows much I love this place! Got there at 7:30 the hostess said its about a 20 minute wait pulled a little note pad out of her pocket wrote our names down and said stay near by. An hour later I saw another couple walk up and get seated before us, ask the hostess why and she said they were on her lists 1st. For a $100 meal there should be a better process of notifying the patrons then a note pad. Then at 9pm we were seated, told the waiter and hostess we were there for my birthday but never once even got a happy birthday. Not very personal and disappointing. The waiter seemed rushed and was not knowledgable on the menu or dishes, again not wanting to socialize with us, a table of 4 girls who were sober! On top of all the crappy service, long wait to be seated, then a 45 minute wait for our food, we all got sick from the food, and spent our last night and my birthday throwing up from my $100 birthday dinner!
We went at 1:40 am and waited about 40 minutes. It's a tiny bar that seats 18 people. From 1-9am, they have moonlight specials: 1/2 dozen oysters for $10, $3 draft, $5 wine. . . They are a well oiled machine. Every transition is seamless. Watching the chef cook in the steam kettle was a show. . . We ordered oysters, combo pan roast, and New England clam chowder. The oysters were very fresh; the house made cocktail sauce was phenomenal. The pan roast was delicious. I didn't like the chowder nearly as much as my boyfriend. It was a little runny. Great experience overall.
Hands down, the best pan roast places I have ever eaten. . . Ordered the combo pan roast and it's large enough to share with another person. The spiciness level ordered was an 8 and there was a slight kick but nothing to set you on fire. Came with rice and an individual roll.... . . Cheap beer so that helps... Looking forward to returning one day. . . Yummy! They don't take chips as payments (FYI)
Thank you for living up to the raving reviews!! Absolute great experience. I will be eating here as much as I can while i'm in town!!
Some of the best food I have EVER eaten. . . The "bar" is in the middle of palace station, has a little over a dozen seats, and there is always a line. They are extremely efficient and if the patrons are eating quickly, we usually get in pretty fast.  . . It is the definition of a hidden gem. . . If I don't organize this I'll go on raving for centuries so I'll make a list of awesome:. . 1) There's a particular guy that works here, he's the only server/host/food runner. That man, is Steve. He seats all the guests, he takes all the orders, he brings you the food, and he is simply, amazing. He must see thousands of people a week, but he recognizes us when we come in and is as attentive as the amount of business will allow, which is impressive. He is a large part of why we come here. . . 2) The food is absolutely amazing. I've had the Clam Chowder, I think New England (?) but I usually stick to a pan roast with an extra scoop of rice. It's amazing. I can't go on enough about it. I literally dream about it. I'm salivating as I write this. . . 3) Despite the fact that its in my least favorite casino and I will normally do anything to avoid it (the casino), I will still come in here, and wait up to 30 minutes standing, in cigarette soaked air, simply because I love this place so much. . . 10 stars!
Gumbo and other savory dishes were good. It was fascinating to watch the food being prepared. The raw oysters and clams were not very good when I went. They were too big and were hard to enjoy. So if you're looking for a warm, filling meal or really big raw seafood then come here. And, of course, be prepared to wait in line.
Amazing! Freshest of fresh mussels oysters and salads! The perfect place to go on a hot summer day in Vegas! Ice cold beer and great key line pie! Staff works hard!
Yes, go here. Since every positive comment possible has already been made, I'll offer a data point instead: 21 people in front of us on a Saturday at 7pm took about 2:15 to get a seat.
So this place located inside Palace Station is so fuckin amazing! I love seafood and Ricardo and the other lady there are jokesters so if you can't take a joke or get offended easily don't eat there...  My girls and I went there one night to try to get dinner and the line was long.. It would be over an hr wait so we came back the next morning/afternoon.  Luckily no line!! We ordered oysters and clams so start.  I ordered the lobster pan roast and it was great. This place is open 24 hrs. Def a spot to come back to.  Very similar yet different from the boiler in chino hills.
I heard the buzz around the Oyster Bar. Dont know what took me so long to try it but I finally did. I ordered the Combo Pan Roast and it is so freaking goooood. Five effing stars with a bonus ef!
Anyone who spends time in Vegas really must stop at the Oyster Bar at least once. . . The name tags of the staff at Palace Station say they love locals, and it seemed like most of the folks in the 18 seats were locals. The locals sitting next to us said a certain chef should be avoided, but everything we had was delicious. . . I would recommend the Bouillabaisse and add the lobster. That's what Josie had and it was simply wonderful. My Palace Station pan fry was good, but not like the Bouillabaisse!. . Be prepared to stand in line for at a minimum of 15 minutes - it's literally a bar with 18 seats as others have noted. You'll stand in an open line right next to bar and they don't rush anyone, so relax!
This is definitely a good place to eat if you are a fan of creamy, seafoody based soups, chowders and gumbo. However the menu isn't too extensive so if you are a picky eater, it's probably best you move on and eat at a different spot. . . As the 1000 other reviewers mentioned, the limited seating+popularity of this place = long lines at all hours of the day. We went early (Vegas early) on a Sunday morning and the wait wasn't too bad, but there was still a wait. . Our chef was super friendly and amazing at multitasking. Between socializing with  customers and cooking the pan roasts and chowders, he was shucking oysters and cleaning pots... He asked me if it was my first time and I told him I had been to the Chino location before but not the Vegas one and he said that the Chino location and the Santa Ana locations were actually unaffiliated with the Oyster Bar. Those were started by a former chef of the Vegas location... In comparison to the unaffiliated "Boiler" in Chino, the taste and the price of the pan roast are pretty similar.  The biggest difference is the Boiler has a much larger menu. . I got the house special pan roast but next time I will order the crab pan roast. The house special had way too many shrimp (I think there were 8 or 9), a few overcooked lobster pieces that was a bit rubbery and not enough crab. I usually order a 6 or 7 spice level but this time I opted for a 2 because I wanted to try some of the many complimentary hot sauces....However I tried some of my fiance's very hot and spicy gumbo (he got an 8) and after singeing my tastebuds, I decided to try non spicy food for a change. The pan roast is so creamy and salty, it tastes just fine on its own. . Service is good considering there is only one server and one busser, but this place could really benefit from an expansion.
Usually I would question the seafood in Las Vegas because its so far from the ocean...but Oyster Bar never disappoints with its freshness! I must mention I lied when I said Bacchanal was the only place in Vegas I would wait in a line for; Oyster Bar inside Palace Station is the only other place I won't complain waiting in line for. Although, I do wish they'd buy up more space on the floor and put in a couple extra tables.. . . Everything they offer here is ahhmazing -both for the taste and view ;) As in their name, oysters, here are superb and a definite must order when eating here.  I highly suggest the combo pan roast which consists of shrimp, lobster, and crab. And (not or! lol) the gumbo. Just do it. You will not regret it my loves. . . They charge an extra $5 if you share entrees but its totally worth it because the portions are very generous. There are no take out orders -which although can be frustrating, I do appreciate it because that means your food is as fresh as possible. And for those of you who like to fill up on soft, buttery bread, they offer that while you wait :). . Another thing I really enjoy is that you can watch the whole process of your delicious foods being prepared, cooked, plated/bowled right in front of you! The chefs are all so nice too. Makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable. Last, for those of you who are going with another person who can't quite handle the heat like you, you're always welcomed to adjust the level of spice in your dishes. But I'd suggest nudging the ones who can't handle the spice, to the plate ;P seafood is always more yummy when its spicy!
Aholy cacophony of flavors bursts with every spoon full.  I'm not big on their New England clam chowder but the etouffee, pan roast, and bouillabaisse gets 5 stars.  Wait sux but worth the experience.  Make sure you order extra to go. :-). The place needs a bigger seating/serving area.
It's disgusting don't go!  Please make the lines shorter for me.
My husband and I travel to Las Vegas several times a year. The highlight of our trip is when we visit The Oyster Bar inside The Palace Station. We usually order The Combo  Pan Roast. It's always amazing! I'm talking if I were to pick a last meal, The Combo Pan Roast is it. The Palace Station is a bit run down, but don't let it deter you from visiting this gem in the desert.
Amazing food!!! This place is a hidden gem.  The food is well worth the wait in line. Grab a few drinks at the Irish Pub across the way and drink them while you wait and chat with friends. The seating you see is all the seating Oyster Bar has. We ordered a dozen raw oysters and shared the Combo Pan Roast. Delicious! They have draft beer as well. The seafood was very fresh. Big suprise being so far from the coast. Great service to go along with our meal. We will definately go back next time were in Vegas!!!!!!
Love this place. Always a must when I come to Las Vegas. . Dozen raw oysters are shucked in front of you and the pan roast/soups too! Oysters taste very fresh and decent size (not too tiny or meaty for me).. The combo pan roast is a must-try! Nice and creamy/saucy goodness with rice and seafood is heaven! The etouffee was also delicious.. You can choose your level of spiciness from 1-10. I enjoy spice just a tad and a 4 was quite spicy. Still enjoyable though. Portions are quite large. 12 oysters and a pan-roast combo with rice easily fills 2 people up with moderate appetite. Unless you want left-overs, order your own.. . The service is always great the past 5-6 times I've came here. . Wait time can be a bummer of minimum 30-60 mins. But this place is open 24-hours so maybe try going during off-peak meal hours.. . There are no more than 20 seats and it is sitting directly within the casino slots.I don't know other chefs that work the front counter, but Bob is a pretty funny guy.
I've been to a few of these steam kettle cooked joints. Ritter's in Costa Mesa, The Boiler in Chino Hills, Texas Star in Texas Station, but Oyster Bar in Palace Station is THE BEST.. . The clam chowder is the creamiest, with the most big pieces of clam; the least amount of sand.. . The pan roast has the most shrimp, crab and lobster.. . The bread is hot and not stale.. . Plus if you go at the right time, you get Ricardo (the Filipino chef). He is the BEST. Pro tip: go on New Year's Day morning and for sure you will never encounter a line.. . Yes it's pricey (for me) but you can bring leftovers home and add more shrimp in there for another meal. . . The minus is 99% of the time there is a huge line, and people don't give a shit they are holding other people up; like they are done but just sit there and gab. It's just the trade off I guess.
My second  time at Oyster Bar and it was amazing.  I came with a party of five the first time and we ordered the seafood jambalaya,  combo pan roast and oysters. Everything was very flavorful and the oysters were delicious!!!  The only real drawback was the wait.  . Expect to wait for an hour to two sometimes but you can't really blame this on them when  the food is so good. It's off the strip inside Palace station so you're going to have to take a taxi if you are staying on the strip. . The waitress and the chef Bob are very attentive.  They interact with the customers and are very fun to talk to. Definitely a must go to place if you like oysters and pan roast!!
Only get the pan roast.  This was my second time here and I tried the gumbo which was okay but not even close to the pan roast.  Service was friendly and very nice.  Worth the wait. Will try the clam chowder next time I go.
Believe the hype. It is THAT good! . We went on a Friday night around 8:30pm and there were about 10 ppl in front of us. We waited for an hour, and yes, it is so worth it!. . We got the half dozen oysters, combo pan roast and the combo gumbo. Oysters shucked right in front of us and tasted fresh. The gumbo was loaded with seafood and flavor but the combo pan roast stole the show. Unbelievable... So flavorful and so creamy. Perfect comfort food and honestly perfect everyday food because it's just that good. Absolutely loaded with shrimp, lobster, crab and delicious flavors. Ricardo made our dishes perfectly. . . This will be a must eat every time I'm in Vegas now!
Wow. I came in with no expectations because I wanted to experience everything first hand. The half she'll oysters is a MUST and r he combo pan roast is AMAZING!
This place fails on so many levels. The largest issue is that no one seems to be in charge here. They have a cook and 2 waitresses.  They lack adequate seating which leaves a long line of hungry people waiting at least an hour to be seated.  I attempted to eat here on a couple of occasions but didn't because of the line.  When I saw a short line on my last night I decided to try it. The waitresses leave dirty dishes in front of empty seats for 10 minutes + only extending the wait for everyone. . . Once I was finally seated a waitress dropped a roll in front of me after a few minutes.  I wasn't actually greeted for another 10 minutes. The waitress who spoke to me asked what I wanted to order and at that point I had to request a menu because she didn't notice I sat there with nothing. I did order something because of the amount of time I had invested. I got a Caesar salad with shrimp to get something quick. The waitress was rude. 'That's all you want?' Followed by a sigh & smacking her mouth. . . The salad had 3 shrimp on it, powdered cheese that 5 year olds eat on spaghetti,  a limp romaine lettuce. . . Save your money & TIME.  Go anywhere else!
Best Gumbo period, and I'm not even a big gumbo fan.  I need to come back and try the pan roast.  Only like 15 seats so expect to wait.
