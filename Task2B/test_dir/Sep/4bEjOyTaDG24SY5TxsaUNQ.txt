My husband and I visited Mon Ami Gabi in Vegas for the first time 2 Saturdays ago. It was during my 1 night/1 day surprise birthday trip, so we stopped in after seeing a comedy show that evening in hopes we'd have a splendid meal. . . Being that it was somewhat late, we were a bit limited as far as restaurant choices went. Normally we hit up buffets, but past 10 p.m. many are closed. So off to this restaurant we went.. . We LOVED it! . . We were seated right away, which was nice. They have outdoor seating and indoor, and we were inside, which I prefer. The ambiance was casual, but respectable. It wasn't hoity toity or uncomfortable, it was more fun and could be classified as 'an experience.' The lights were dim when we arrived, and candles were lit on each table. The place was still bustling when we were seated a little past 10.. . We were given a mini sized baguette off the bat, with butter and a pickled carrot salad plate courtesy of the chef. While our waiter was very much American, the few servers who brought food and water to our table appeared to be French, though I can't be positive if they actually were or if that is part of their job. My husband and I didn't understand some of things that were said to us until we gave it a few minutes of thoughtful consideration after the fact.... . . "Ohhhh, he said CARROT salad.. Oh okay. Man, I was so confused for a second. Now the world makes sense again.". . We started our meal with onion soup. I am a huge onion soup snob. My husband will eat anything labeled 'onion soup,' (including impostors from the likes of po' folk establishments and fast food joints) whereas I, personally, KNOW the proper production imparts a very specific broth color, and I know the appropriate flavorings required to be regarded as somewhat authentic onion soup. This, my friends, met my standards. The bowl was gigantic, so my husband and I shared it, and it was lovely. Onion-y, cheesy, bread-y...... Sigh.. . Onion soup... My Love.. . For our main courses (Because we're piggies*), he ordered a steak frittes entree, and I ordered a hanger steak frittes entree. Both of our meals arrived in a timely fashion, and came with a huge serving of their version of french fries. They appeared to be pieces of potato shaved off and fried. Crispy in some areas, a good chew in others. Well salted. The steaks were good, but I admit I make a better hanger steak at home. . . ---If you haven't tried a hanger steak before, also called a butchers cut, go to Whole Foods and get a couple. They are often lower in fat than other steaks, and they are soft and divine and easy to portion out. I make mine with a smoky spicy marinade, and it is amazing. Amazing like I almost cry when I take my first bite. Every time. . . "Oh my gosh, how did I make something so miraculous? Sniff sniff. It's like my hands are a gift from the heavens, and I was created specifically to make hanger steaks."--- . . Of course, of utmost importance in any civilized person's life is dessert. Basically, I plow my way through meals just to get to dessert. Sometimes, I order dessert for dinner when I go to restaurants, because that's how smart I am. Skip the savory, all that chewing ich! Let me eat cake!. . We ordered the "La Grande Profiterole." Or something like that. It was a puff-type pastry, filled with a rich vanilla ice cream, that comes with a vat of fudgy warm chocolate sauce. The server who brought the plate to us first poured a bit of the chocolate sauce on top of the dessert before exclaiming something I still haven't deciphered, and after he left, we poured all of the remaining chocolate over the top of the unfamiliar dessert. . . Chocolate sauce is to dessert what Ketchup or Tobasco is to dinner. Am I right??? I think that's on the SATs. You're welcome, high school kids. . . It was amazing! Delicious! Stupendous! Superb! Excellent! Decadent! Rich! Sinful! The pastry was light and clean, the ice cream was smooth and heavy, the sauce had a deep almost alcohol-infused flavor, though that's just my opinion. Great success!. . I cannot wait to go back to this restaurant again in a year. I will salivate as I daydream and relive the memories for the next 12 months. I recommend!. . PS - Our waiter was lovely. He was so polite and patient and efficient. And quite tall. . . *Despite our copious food intake, neither of us are unhealthy or pushing any limits with our bodies. We ride bikes for miles every week and eat pretty healthily at home. Yet, I still sleep on a pile of sugar. It's just so supportive.
Greeted promptly and seated. The ambience of the restaurant was cute. I think the patio seating would be a great choice when the weather is a little more pleasant. Enjoyed the strawberry brioche French toast, prefect touch of sweetness definitely not over bearing. Steak and eggs was tasty, this dish will fill you up.
Good view but okay food. I'd rather go to Bouchon in the Venetian for brunch if you want good brunch food. But they don't have the same amazing view. . . FOOD:. Chocolate Croissant (4 stars): Flaky with a good amount of chocolate. . . Strawberry Vanilla French Toast (3.5 stars): Nothing too special. . . Croque madame (3 stars): Salty and it smelled weird. Pretty small also. Although I love their french fries, that was probably my favorite thing here.. . VIEW (5 stars):. If you get a seat on the patio you get to watch the Bellagio Fountains go off every 15 minutes. Beautiful view. You also get to people watch and see people take pictures of every little thing!. . SERVICE (5 stars):. Our waitress was really nice. She acknowledged our special occasion but we did not get anything complimentary. . . Basically you're coming here for the view, don't come for food, and don't come to sit inside. Inside was still nice but at least outside you have an outstanding view that balances the average food.
I had to write a review just to say their smoked salmon is to die for! A must try!! Food was delicious, we had an order of their oysters, smoked salmon, corned beef hash w/poached eggs and the steak bordelaise (bomb!), Only problem was that the service fell a little short (I'm guessing because it's LDW) but overall a great place.
Our favorite place on the strip.  Great food, great prices and great staff.  Especially Billy, Robert and Diego.  Thanks guys!  We like the bar counter next to the outside patio.  Always great service and get to hang out with locals. . . D & S
This place was amazing in every way! From my wait at the bar to the service for lunch, it was a great experience. Had a deliciously crisp cucumber martini made by the bartender at the front. I could drink those all friggin day.. . My friends and I ordered the goat cheese and escargot for appetizers. Both were very tasty. I ordered the seafood crepe for my brunch/lunch. YUM. It has a wonderful cream sauce on the inside with peas. You get three large shrimp and two large scallops. Both the shrimp and the scallops were wonderfully seasoned and cooked to perfection. DELISH. OH, and I almost forgot about the baguettes! SO YUMMY. I think the four of us polished off three loaves of that before we ate our entrees. We love our carbs, lol.. . The staff was very friendly, Service was on point. Food came out in a timely manner. Wish we had one of these in STL!
Went here with my boyfriend on saturday, really good!!. . Service was awesome! . .  Tomato summer salad was not what I expected, but I loved it!. . Great vegetarian options! The vegetable farcis was sooooo good. And my boyfriend loved his steak. . . We will be back.
I intensely love this place. This is only the second French restaurant I have eaten at, I love this place.. . 1. Sitting on the patio is a very special experience. there are tiny little birds that hop around you trying to find bread crumbs. the patio is the epitome of romantic!. . 2. I have never had fresher grapefruit. . 3. Organic yogurt parfaits? YES PLEASE.. . 4. Orange juice is magnificent. . . 5. Breakfast menu is just perfect. Goodness yes...I love breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi!
Great location!  We had breakfast here two times during our weekend inVegas. I eat gluten free and the gluten free french toast is AWESOME! Seriously good. It's a wet french toast, with fresh whip cream and fresh fruit. REALLY GOOD!  Location is great right on the strip. You will have to wait for an outside table but we sat in the atrium which was open and sunny with a view of the action on the strip. Service was a bit slow but I would say both our waiters were experienced and professional. We watched the one deal with a difficult customer very well. I was about to tell the customer to take a hike but the waiter remained friendly with the jerk.  My wife had the waffles one day which she did not love. Had the french toast (non GF) the next day and she loved it.  Bread is definitely their specialty!  The breakfast menu was not huge but was quite broad.  Overall solid 4 stars and we will be back!
Little more than a restaurant that masks itself as a French restaurant but in reality is little more than French-ish cafeteria food. Good cafeteria food it may be, but calling it a French restaurant is generous. A friend and I both had different steaks that, for the price, I expected to be quite good. Instead, our cuts of meat were both mediocre quality and the "red wine reduction" I had with mine, resembled au jus more than a reduction. Would not recommend this place if you're used to real French food.
Came here for my birthday dinner with a special friend.  He made sure to get a nice table between the inside and outside with the perfect view of the fountains at Bellagio.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The food was amazing.. . We got.... Escargot - delicious!. Salmon tartar- perfection!!. Duck Country pate - delicious!. Trout almandine - light and well seasoned fresh fish that came with perfectly steamed beans.. . Everything was perfect and the cherry on top was the creme brulee.  Had one of the best birthdays here with my friend.  Looking forward to coming back and trying other things on the menu.
Great food. We frequent every 2 months or so. We really enjoy the location and the option for outdoor seating. Sitting outdoors puts you right in the middle of the buzzing strip action and a great view of the Bellagio water show.  I highly recommend the steak or a fish special. Moderately priced for the amount of food you receive.
Check in on labor day weekend for breakfast. Never a fan of a tourist spot restaurants but its always cool to try new things. Couldn't decide and my phone shut off from partying so hard to tell what to get aha. Had the steak and eggs and it was okay, coulda been better, 4oz steak was flat and small. Friends had seared tuna sandwich - it was huge but a lil too salty and old. And the special steak - which was really good. We were also in the middle room so it got a lil chilly from the wind blowing out. Definetly would like to try againn
Located inside the Paris Hotel.  Lovely ambiance, great service and awesome food.  . . Love their French toast with blueberry sauce and fresh blueberries even though the first time was so much more amazing than the second time.  They unfortunately cooked it way too much and it was quite burned the second time around but I was so hungry I didn't send it back.  :(. . . Their prime steak sandwich is actually super tasty. The slices of meat are very tender and juicy.  Love their dipping sauce.  My mouth is watering as I am talking about it. Also their chicken Brie sandwich is very yummy.  Good portions too so you could share.  . . Unfortunately haven't had a chance to sit and dine outside with the lovely views of the Bellagio fountain because the few times I went were extremely hot outside but I will once it starts to cool down.  . . They have such amazing bread & it's complimentary.  Be sure to have some but control yourself from eating the whole batch so you will have room for your meal.  ;). . Very enjoyable experience!!!
I know it's a chain, but it's still one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!. . When my flight gets in late, no worries, this place is open late.  And the later you go, the better chance you have of getting a spot on or near the patio where you can watch the Bellagio fountains while you sip your glass of bordeaux and await the most delicious steak frites with bearnaise sauce and pureed cauliflower.  Pureed cauliflower, you say?!  It's absolute heaven!  I've gotten several others addicted to this stuff as well.  I'd almost make a take-out order anytime I was in the casino of just pureed cauliflower if I wasn't always in a rush!. . Love this place!  It will continue to be the first dinner I have every time I visit.
Zum Fruhstuck - speziell im Sommer vor 0900 bei ertraglicher Hitze - auf der Terrasse einfach herrlich! Das Fruhstuck war wirklich sehr gut! Die Bedienung ist sehr freundlich - ein Tischwechsel war kein Problem... Man sollte spatestens um 0830 hier sein, sonst gibts keinen Platz auf der Terrasse!. Preislich nicht billig, aber man bekommt auch was furs Geld.... Beim nachsten vegastrip kommen wir wieder!
Found this place on the way to bouchon. It was 8:30 am, already hot, and the patio at The Paris was way too good to pass up! Not on any of the must-try lists I'd seen before I booked our honeymoon, I wasn't sure about the detour.  The doorway is divided by a velvet rope, for exiting and entering customers. On our way out at about 10am, I could see why.. . The bar and dining rooms are spacious and there's an atrium area next to the large patio, where most people were sitting. These were all good signs.. . The coffee is excellent, and the mimosa is the perfect strength. Off to a great start, I debated between the ham and cheese crepe  and the mushroom omelette. The omelette won since it included a fair amount of brie. My husband chose the strawberry and vanilla waffle, which meant I got to try some of that as well, love being married :).. . His waffle came with a saucer of freshly whipped cream, to add to the fresh strawberry slices already topping the waffle. Our omelette came with hashbrowns and toasted baguette slices. I also got butter and jam for the toast.. . I couldn't finish my half of the entrees, but they were both very nice! We were also given a dessert menu, but even my husband, after his breakfast and a half, couldn't eat another bite.. . The patio was gorgeous, perfect for strip-side people watching. I loved the decor as well. And on the way out, dozens of people were on the other side of the rope, waiting to be seated. Mon Ami is a great start to Vegas scale festivities!
I've been to Vegas so many times and walk by this place.... Finally got to try it for late dinner with friends. Have to say it was surprisingly pleasant. Ambience was nice   dim lighting, excellent customer service, and delicious food. . Everyone raves how nice the patio seating is...I didn't get to dine on the patio . (Too hot!) Maybe on a cooler night. . Food: We ordered a few appetizer... Smoked salmon, oysters, escargots.  All delicious and flavorful. Main dish I ordered caramelized sea scallops. Which I highly recommend. I did try my friends steak... It was tender and super tasty. finished off with house coffee... Loved it. Strong and sweet just how I like it  Will definitely try this place again.
Came here for a bachelorette party. Big group of about 25 girls. The restaurant arranged a separate section with a prefixed menu for us. $60 +tip/person for a 3 course meal (not including drinks). Arrangements were made ahead of time and finalized about a week prior. Very accommodating and great for holding special events with big groups. I ordered the following:. . - Warm Brie: AMAZING! Highly recommend! . - Filet Mignon: Juicy & cooked perfect!. - Chocolate Mousse: Creamy & delicious!. . Everything about the meal was perfect..right down to the veggies that came with the steak. My friend ordered the sea scallops gratinees. Tried that and also very good! . . Service was OK. Servers were very nice and professional. However the food could of came out faster. Although we were in a big group, this was prearranged so they should have been a little more prepared. Dinner was set for 8:45 PM but the first course didn't come out til an hr later. However once the first course was served, the rest of the food came out in a timely manner. Overall good experience and I will definitely be coming back. After reading some reviews I hope to get seating in the patio next time!
Took my BF for dinner here on Labor Day to celebrate his 30th birthday and had a memorable experience.. . We opted to wait 15min, though we had reservations, so that we could be seated in the pavilion. Worth the wait! The walls were opened up to a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains, but you still had the comfort of the air conditioned dining room and seclusion from the strip crazies walking past the patio.. . The entire front of the house staff was sweet and attentive, really provided genuine service. It slipped my mind to let them know it was my BF's birthday celebration since the real day was 2 days before, yet the service was as though they really wanted our night to be remembered. I let the server know and she said she'd take care of it.. . The food was amazing! Baked goat cheese appetizer was inspiring! Mussels mariniere was cooked perfectly! The baguette was perfect for soaking up all the extras. We each had a steak frites, he had the bone in rib eye and I had the bordelaise, a pounded steak with caramelized onions and red wine sauce. Both were delicious and we were unable to finish.. . We enjoyed our meal with a carafe of the "Frangia" which complimented each of our courses. Would've loved to try a dessert, but we were too full, so the complimentary profiterole for his birthday was perfect.. . Will definitely go again on our next trip! Can't wait to try their brunch!
A surprisingly chill (and delicious) place to drop in for a late breakfast on The Strip. Can't speak for it after dark, but assuming it probably gets a bit out of control. Will definitely consider it again for a morning pick-me-up.
This food was great and so was the view. The only reason why I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars is because of the service... Our server seemed bothered that she had to wait on us and was flat out rude the whole time.
I went here for brunch, and it was terrific.  The patio was nice and shady in the morning, the wait staff was friendly and kept our glasses full, and the coffee and mimosas were excellent!  . . I ordered a strawberry vanilla waffle with a side of bacon, my wife ordered a mushroom and brie omelette.  Both entrees were absolutely delicious.  The waffles were crispy, light, and sweet.  The bacon was cooked perfectly.  The omelette was something to be savored. . . Great menu, great atmosphere conducive to conversation, and great way to start a day on the strip!
We had breakfast here on our last morning in Vegas,and it was excellent.  Although it was busy, our server was fantastic.  We also lucked out with a great table in the area which is open to the sidewalk.  . . My husband had the eggs benedict special, which had sliced lamb shank in place of the more traditional Canadian bacon. He thought this was excellent.  He also had orange juice, which was good.  . . I had the mushroom omelette, which was excellent.  I loved the jam which was served with the accompanying toast.  I also had coffee, which was never empty, thanks to our server.  . . Both dishes came with breakfast potatoes/hashbrowns, which were good.
Eggs florentine are where the magic's at, waitress recommended a Brie/heirloom tomato version...impeccable. hash browns have the perfect crunch, coffee is good, not great. Sit in the 'glass room' and watch the water show. Overall, fantastique food in decent portions & good prices, visually stunning and beautiful french vibe.
I always wanted to try this place.  The location is amazing and of course you want balcony seating for the incredible Bellagio views.  . What was really surprising is how great the food was.  The seafood lunch platter was absolutely steller.
The wait to get in was not too bad at all.  Once we were seated, the service was good and efficient.  The food is quite good, but I'm not sure it is worth what they charge.  You can be seated right on the strip in front of Paris Hotel Casino.  My and my daughter had dinner and a drink and it was a little over a hundred dollars.  I wouldn't go back just because the expense did not match the quality.  But, if you want to sit in a nice restaurant, eat good food and be on the strip, and you have some money to burn, this is a good place to go.  It is always busy, so make a reservation.
This is one of our favorite places on the Strip for a lunch or brunch. . . Great quality of food, great atmosphere and staff. Try to get a seat outside if the weather is not too hot. . . The extensive menu is sure to satisfy everyone's needs but I highly recommend the crepes and the eggs Benedict!. . We will definitely be back :)
It was okay... The eggs Benedict was bland but the hash browns were good. It was a nice atmosphere but the food is nothing special. I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 3 because the service was excellent!
Our favorite restaurant for steak.  This is one of few restaurants on the strip that I would recommend.  I'm usually one for variety but the filet mignon with red wine reduction is so good that I cannot bring myself to order anything else.
Overall a really great restaurant!. . I love the location, it's right on the Las Vegas Boulevard with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountain show. . . The food is delicious, I had the salmon and the Trout and both were excellent. . . Their sangria and their cocktails are FANTASTIC!. . Also, the bananas foster with ice cream in a crepe is just delicious. . . I love coming here, plus the prices are very reasonable considering the fact that you are getting a delicious meal on the Las Vegas Strip! . . Such a great place. I highly recommend checking it out. But if you do, make a reservation! They are always busy.
The muscles were out of this world along the best seats in the house - across from the fountains, refreshing coolness in the shade, and spicy bloody marys.
I loved having brunch here. I made reservations through open table and was seated quickly. The service was excellent and the food delicious. I tried the fruit bowel in a cantaloupe cup. It was actually on the breakfast menu & even though we arrived for brunch they had no problems letting us order it. If you go for a celebration they will also give you a cream puff with ice cream. This was the highlight of the meal. I highly recommend everything here.
I'm going to be one of "those" people and complain about this well-established and popular joint. I made us reservations so the wait was a non-issue. Our server was a true gentleman and was knowledgeable about the menu, so that was also not a concern. But the food was where I was a little bothered. First let me say that the bread and presentation is delicious and well-thought out, respectively. I was super excited to eat the Steak Frites, which is usually one of my favorite combinations, but very disappointed in the fact that they use grain-feed beef and are proud of it, as described on the menu. EW. As a quality meat lover and Paleo-enthusiast, I cannot support commercial farming by ordering that, sorry. As a result, I ordered fish, which I realize is a "no-no" at a Steakhouse. Under the circumstances (I was actually grossed out), I felt no other choice, and let's say I won't be ordering that again. The frites, which I did try, where totally not the way I imagined them to be, as they were a weird shape and not delicately fried like I hoped. Our starter was OK...the warm brie, but since I'm not a fan of hazelnuts, I wouldn't order that again, either.. I hope I'm not insulting anyone in saying that you would only like this place if you're used to eating mediocre quality food. If you buy Organic produce and Grass-fed meat and hit the farmer's market for seasonal, fresh food, don't bother.
Not always what you pay is what you get. Because it's Vegas, the majority of restaurants go for, at the least, $25 per person. Here, price is equivalent to mediocrity. My party of 3 paid almost $100 (including tip) for thin steak, 4 scallops and a tablespoon of salmon tartar. I've been to France and portions aren't THAT small. . They sat us in an area where we could view the strip. Nothing special. But at least the servers were friendly and consistently check on you.
This would get 5 stars if the fries were less like potato chips and more like frites.
I have been here a couple times and it never disappoints! . I came here with a group of 7 girls this past Saturday for brunch. . Since I was one of the only girls who's been there before, I recommended them try the escargot, of course, they loved it! It came with 6 pieces of escargots and we used the bread to dip with the remaining of the sauce, delicious! We went through 4 bags of bread haha.. I shared my prime rib sandwich, and that was a good size. Even sharing it, i still couldn't finish my half, so I pulled out the meat and ate that instead of all the bread. . The steak frites that came with it was my fave part of this dish. The most intriguing part was that it was like a cross between a fry and a potatoe chip. . The rest of the girls got their own individual plates, and said that was too much food for one person, so I might recommend sharing a plate. . We sat outside in the patio and there was a wonderful breeze, fun for people watching and you get a great view of the Bellagio water fountains from across the street. I definitely would come again and would recommend this place to anyone. . Dinner would be best time to try this place, and make sure to sit outside.
We ordered snails for appetizer. The meat is tender and good to eat with baguette.. My order was salad. Love toasted baguette added in the salad.. Didn't try my friend's steak. Looks nice though
Love Mon Ami Gabi for Dinner. Maybe not the most interesting and eclectic Dinner menu in the village but very solid nonetheless - a menu full of all hits, no misses. Staff were very accommodating of our stroller, which makes a nice change for the area. Only complaint was over-attentive waitstaff clearing clearly unfinished meals away
Beautiful restaurant! Build your own bloody mary, authentic French cuisine, I loved it. I thought service was great, but it was the morning after a very long night so I was preoccupied. I will definitely go back again another time. I had the Salmon Tartare and it was was as good as you could expect. I really wished they had steak tartare, maybe that was on the dinner menu. The only complaint I would have is that the corner table in the pavilion room actually smelled like Paris a little bit (more authentic points!), which if you know Paris, it is a little stinky. A slight sewer smell but not enough to lose my appetite :)
Dinner reservation for 9 for a bachelorette party weekend. Not a long wait once we arrived, especially for a large group. Love the look/feel of the place. Really great patio seating and views of Bellagio's Fountains during dinner. I had the trout amandine (trout, almond slices, preserved lemon, French haricot vert green beans) for my main entree, the crusty bread was pretty good too. Others at the table went for the steak frites with different sauces, the seared scallops, and one end of the table split an appetizer. I'm glad I received a fairly large piece of fish; the seared scallops only came with four scallops total for the price. The steaks were generous but I didn't feel like red meat that night. Didn't opt for any dessert since we had to get to Drais by a certain time.
I had a business dinner there and it went great. The staff put us at a beautiful table on the patio and made sure there was no sun in our eyes so we could talk business. Great food too.
I came to Mon Ami Gabi for lunch with my mom and sister. We sat inside because the 100 degrees beating down on diners on their patio didn't sound appealing. Their restaurant is nicely designed because although we were inside, we weren't really inside because the cafe portion is open air leading out to the patio. I really enjoyed the luxury of both the air conditioning and  outdoor seating. . . Their menu had a good selection, but not many options. For my entree I chose the chicken, mushroom, and kale crepe. I imagined my entree to be a dinky crepe, but I was very wrong! The crepe was huge and delicious! . . I'm giving Mon Ami Gabi 3 stars because it is good, but not amazing. I would come back again.
Cappuccino in a bowl - my favorite!  Best for brunch over looking the fountains.  If it's not too cold outside, wait for outside seating. It's worth the wait!
Mon Ami Gabi is a great restaurant for a number of reasons: 1) the decor and warm, dark lighting inside make you feel like you're in a Parisian restaurant; 2) delicious French food; 3) outdoor seating with great views of the Vegas strip; 4) real French people serving you; and 5) fairly reasonable prices.. . However, the drawbacks are 1) they won't tell you how long the wait is if you call (ridiculous!); 2) the wait can apparently get pretty long.. . I came here on business, and had the goat cheese appetizer in a tomato sauce (it is AWESOME) and their most popular chicken dish without the bacon. Both were very good, but the appetizer stole the show. My waiter was French Canadian, so I practiced my high school French with him. Service was efficient, but not overly friendly or talkative - probably owing to how busy it gets here.. . THIS IS NOT A CHEAP $$ restaurant, unless you get one cheap entree. More likely, you are in the $$$ range. Just fair warning. That being said, for French food, it isn't obscenely expensive.
Delicious! ordered two steak frites, one with filet and both with Bearnaise sauce. The star should be the steak which was good but man I loved all the frites! I ordered my filet medium rare and I may just be being picky but it was more on the rare side. I still loved it either way!
We were here for a conference and had 18 for the "team dinner".  with  a big group it is more about service than food but was surprised food and service were suburb.  They suggested 6PM for the  reservation because of big group.  We were sat at very nice long table in the dining room so felt like on table, rather than a few just shoved together- did not feel awkward with big group.  They had dedicated wait person for out table -Very VERY good service ! which is usually hard w big group.  Dinner was great - food was well done, i had the steak w blue cheese - awesome !  simple but excellent.  They served all 18 at same time (9 waiters came out together).  I was " in charge" on picking ( add some stress :)  )and "big boss" said it was great choice (whew).  we did look out at outside seating - next time, wife and i r going to do that cause looked great
We came here for dinner.  The onion soup was excellent but the entree was not as good. . . We each ordered a steak and three of us wanted mashed potatoes instead of frites. All of us got frites.  I think it is inexcusable to serve three incorrect entrees. The waiter did bring the mashed potatoes after we complained. I am not sure why they ask how we wanted our steaks cooked as they are so thin you couldn't possible get a rare steak. Price was equivalent to mediocrity as we paid 27.95 for really thin tasteless steaks.. . I do have to say that the waiter was polite and efficient and the bernaise sauce was quite good covering up the tasteless steaks but I wont come back.
We had lunch at Mon Ami Gabi and it was a very nice experience. We made reservations for 12pm and we were seated promptly. We sat outside and enjoyed the view. The complimentary bread is nice and fresh. I had the Frangria which was delicious and refreshing. I ordered the small and got 2 glasses out of it. I ordered the Shrimp and Scallop Crepe and my husband ordered the Chicken, Apple and brie sandwich. Both were excellent and the pomme frittes were delicious and perfectly seasoned. We will certainly go back again next time we are in Vegas.
Ordered the daily special and steak Classique. Enjoyed our food, good service and the fresh hot bread is a fantastic starter.
I've been here a few times and I don't think it has ever disappointed me.  Mon Ami is situated right in front of the Eiffel tower, overlooking the water show at the Bellagio, with outdoor seating for those who love to people watch. . . During the summer nights, I would definitely recommend sitting outside and enjoying the warm breeze while you enjoy their delicious food.  Seriously, this is the perfect dinner spot. It's like a show and dinner type of dining experience.  There's always something interesting happening on the streets of Las Vegas that you're almost guaranteed to see something worth talking about over dinner.  Think you might run out of things to talk about during your dinner date in Las Vegas?  Bring your date here.. . On my recent trip to Las Vegas over this weekend, I ordered the jumbo crab cakes and the salmon and spinach salad. The saladwas absolutely delicious!  Salmon was cooked perfectly and the dressing was mild and good.  The crab cakes were average.  Definitely not the best I've had and I definitely wouldn't order it again. . . Despite the crab cakes, my previous experiences have been good so I would probably go back on my next visit.
I don't think their is a better restaurant  in Las Vegas.  . . Frangria, steak, frites and watching the Bellagio fountains.
Features:. -For Hors D'oeuvres, we had the Wild Escargots de Bourgogne.  The roasted snails with garlic-herb butter was so delicious, each escargot melted so softly in my mouth.  Do listen to yelp reviewers and order this!. -We shared the filet mignon (3 of the 3 ounces) and it was delicious.  Although, I do recall that we ordered it to be medium rare, the meat came out nearly well done.  Regardless, the meat was still good.  This gourmet meal was well prepared.  . . Improvements:. -I wish we got what we asked for (medium rare filet mignon).  . -The bread was too hard, I had to peel it apart to eat the inside because it was scratching my gums.. -Atmosphere is nice but a little too dark.. . Tips:. -Make sure you try the escargot!. -Make a reservation in advance to ensure a table.
Ate here last night, everything was great!  Had a steak, baked Brie and sangria's.  Great view of the bellagio's fountain show, if you siteoutside or close to the outside area.
Great French place for creeps, French onion soup, scallops, and salads! Had a little trouble this visit with loosing our complete order but they made it right!  Also, believe it or not, try their Sangria with Fresh french bread and Onion Soup!  The perfect concoction for a weonderful afternoon staring at the Bellagio Fountains!
Amazing- we had a working lunch at an outside table with climate control. Our server, Ryan, was professional, knowledgable, quick, humble, confident, a great listener and had a fabulous smile; and he served us quickly. Ironically, they messed up my order (granted- I asked for subs) but he fixed it promptly and it was so good, I would order it again. In case your curious- I got the fillet of grilled chicken, Brie, Granny Smith apples and caramelized onions with butter lettuce leaves instead of bread and a side of mixed fruit. I pared it with cold champagne and it was fabulous. My colleagues loved their meals as well. The view of people watching and the Bellagio was super fun too. I would highly recommend this place.
Best place in town for breakfast especially on patio views of strip. Love gigantic cappuccinos!  Delicious goat cheese and spinach omlette. Fresh french toasted bread. Professional wait staff!!! Fairly priced.
1st lunch in Vegas on 9/11/14.  Party of 4.  Sat outside and did have a view of Bellagio fountains.  Found the menu a little limited.  Loved the crepe; I believe I had the mushroom one.
For years now we've loved going to Mon Ami Gabi. We always hit this place for breakfast when we go to Vegas (3-4 times a year). I recently broke with my ham and cheese crepe tradition and ordere the french toast. ZOMG. This is the best french toast in Vegas (I've been on a crusade to find it).
40. ?. . . !
Perfect view of the Bellagio fountains if you're lucky enough to be seated outside, or are willing to wait a few minutes at the bar for your patio table. Food and service were both outstanding, as usual. Waitress was very nice and attentive, but not overbearing. Noise level is obviously fairly high since the place is bustling 16 hours a day and the doors to the strip are open, but not 'STK' loud, if you understand that difference. Been here several times and have never been let down, for the price you will be hard-pressed to find a better place to eat in Las Vegas.
Great service- overpriced food :-/
I usually stop by here at least once for brunch when I'm in Vegas. It really is a great spot for dining. I got the chicken, apple and Brie crepe last time I went and it was delicious. The crepe was freshly made and the taste of the Brie, chicken and apple really complemented the dish as a whole. After my meal I will satiated and satisfied. I had one skinny mimosa which was good but it was also $11. The food is pricey but hey, when in Vegas..
I dine here every visit to Vegas.  The food is consistantly delicious and the staff is awesome.
My friend and I had to be in and out within 30 minutes. The Waitress was a star. She got us exactly that with pizzazz (friend caught her giggle as she passed by us since we were being so silly trying to eat everything within 10~15 minutes lol). They were also very understanding and accommodating even though we kept pushing our reservation back at the last minute. Food was very delicious, and this was very much noted amidst all the rush. Will definitely go back if I'm back in Vegas, this time with more time to actually savor the flavors.
My favorite meal in Vegas, especially for breakfast.  Ideal location across from Bellagio.
Good food in general, steak and veggies were well prepared. Didn't care for the fries, they were like greasy potato shreds and most unappealing. I thought it was a little pricey for what it was. Service was excellent.
I've been a regular here for a while.  When I say regular, I mean more like a "been coming here a few times a year" type of regular.  There's not much more that can be said about this place other than it's awesome.. . Service is consistently great, and the food is always very good and a great value considering the atmosphere.  I dove in to the bloody mary bar on my last visit, and though I'm not a huge bloody mary type of person, the selection of ingredients and selection of whatever quality vodka you'd like makes it something anyone can enjoy, as long as they're in to having a drink with brunch.  . . This is one of those most stop kind of places if you're a local and have some visitors in town for the first time.  The patio is nice, but really anywhere in the bar area is just as good and usually a much shorter wait if you're coming in on a whim.
Great dinner! Got a cream puff included for my birthday!
We went there with a couple locals and enjoyed the meal very much.  I had the Beef Wellington - something you don't see very often, and it was absolutely perfect.  Even the spinach that it came with was good, and I hate cooked spinach.. Service was excellent.. Only issue is the price - hefty, but by Las Vegas strip standards, it was a good deal.
food is still great but I've definitely noticed the quality of the coffee has lowered...
The service was top notch, both the bartender and waitress were very accommodating.  The oysters were as fresh as the staff recommended, however the main course and desert were completely lackluster.  The steaks were barely adequate, and my date's filet was tough as cardboard.
Really good food and excellent service! The terrace is really nice. The location is perfect, with views to the Bellagio fountains. We had the steaks with different sauces and they were all really good. The meat was cooked just like each one of us said they wanted it and the quality was really good. I had the sea scallops which were amazingly tasty! The only thing we didnt like was that our table was right under the air conditioning and some of us were cold. We asked the waitress to turn it down but she couldnt and instead, she brought some blankets. Totally recommendable!
This review is of our experience and not of the food (we didn't get that far). Had a reservation for lunch - this was a place I was super excited to try out given all the great reviews. We walked in and the whole place reeked of smoke, but it's LV so most things smell of smoke. We were passed off to the girl to seat us and she took us to the little greenroom/sunroom area which was was like a freaking sauna. I asked her to be seated somewhere more shaded and she points to the table next to this one and says we can sit there. Mind you, there is indoor seating, with people sitting indoors, and in the shade. I completely lost it - they had already asked my seating preference at the hostess stand, I had asked for indoor seating - she said sure and took proceeded to take me OUTSIDE.  I just sat because if I opened my mouth any further we were going to have problems. Our waiter approached, took our drink order and we asked for Sweet N Low - and were told that they don't have any - who doesn't have Sweet N Low??!! We, ultimately decided to just leave. Sweat was pouring down our backs and things weren't going well otherwise. Horrible, horrible service experience.......then we had to find somewhere else to eat on a Friday afternoon at lunchtime. Double angry now!
For a place whose specialty is steak, I had the toughest bone-in rib eye I have ever eaten. Too bad, as the rest of the meal was pretty good but no excuse for shoe leather like steaks at a steak house! My wife's' filet mignon was done nicely and the sides were decent but I couldn't honestly recommend this place.
We had lunch here with friends who were visiting. First, it was pricy...but expected, due to the strip location. The reason they get two stars is because the ambiance was lovely, service was just ok but the food quality was fairly lousy. The sangria was good as was the baguette they brought for appetizer. I ordered Quiche Lorraine (French Restaurant, right? Should be good). It was about 30 seconds from being burnt. It was so "well-done" the eggs were dried out. Portion was very small considering it came with about six potato chips on the side for $14 or $15. My husband ordered Macaroni Gratin. It was also dry and flavorless. He sent it back and ordered a hamburger, specified NO RAW ONIONS! It was cooked to order but raw onion on it and NO CONDIMENTS! The waiter dropped it and ran. Never came back to check on us. Finally had to grab another employee to get new lettuce and tomatoes that were contaminated by the onion and some condiments. Not in any hurry to go back.
Came to dinner with a girlfriend and had a lovely time. The ambience is perfect for a night out. We dressed up but didn't feel over dressed as attire ranged from typical tourist to LBDs. . The service was good. The bread was fresh, soft and delicious.We ordered the Tuna Nicoise salad and Steak Frites with Bernaise sauce to split between us. The salad was superb, and sadly left us a little full to thoroughly enjoy our steak, which was delicious as well. . Too full for dessert, but Mon Ami Gabi gets two thumbs up!
Strolled in around 10 AM on a Sunday morning. There was a wait for outdoor seating (which is great for people watching!) Since I was starving, we decided to just eat inside as there wasn't a wait.. . I ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs and my fiance ordered the cinnamon apple waffle.. . We totally wanted to go with crepes or something French since we were eating here, but it's what we were craving at the time.. . The corned beef hash and eggs was the best I've yet to ever have! The corned beef was sooo yummy, and the poached eggs were cooked perfectly! . . His cinnamon apple waffle was great too! It came with a side of house made whipped cream which was super light and fluffy- yum!. . Breakfast here is great and next time we're in town, we'll definitely stop in for dinner!
My guest and I both ordered the Filet Mignon Merlot and at $37, we were anticipating a delightfully juicy cut of prime beef. Oh the disappointment when the first bite was dry, tough and full of tendons. We sent them back hoping for better. Sadly the next steak was just as poor in quality despite being seasoned, well seared and cooked to the right temperature. The manager eventually appeared and apologized as you would expect. Surprisingly he then admitted knowing about a problem with their meat provider's product quality. The biggest disappointment was that they still chose to serve these steaks in the first place. Perhaps the $$ should be $$$ and the current 4-star rating needs updating.
For what they're going for, and what they actually provide, they need to work harder.  It's good... but should be better.. . Big black hair in the food... very uncaring service... food was on the lukewarm side.  Sure, what I had was tasty (berry crepe with lemon creme), but everyone else had a very meh to bad meal.
I was SUPER psyched about going here for dinner.  Some dishes were excellent, like the french onion soup, the frittes, my filet mignon, and the FREE bread.  But some dishes really missed the mark: steak frittes (the skirt steak) and the mussels were inedible.  To top it off, the $30 corkage fee was excessive and the service was really really lackluster.  It really didn't feel like they cared about the customers.
excellent food.  had the filet-au poivre--perfect medium rare, with excellent taste.  Paired nicely with a great bordeaux.  Terrific service!
This place was okay.  The restaurant is crowded and loud.  So don't go if you are looking for a quiet romantic evening.  The cocktails were ok, not up to Las Vegas level.  Not a place to go if you are want to eat health either.  Everything has meat, cheese and is covered in oil.
This is my third time dining at this restaurant and we have went here twice during this trip in Vegas.  Once for dinner and the other for lunch the next day. The service is immaculate here and servers are always making sure we have everything we need. . I had the steak frites au poivre.  Price was $27 for the entree which was very affordable.  The peppercorn sauce was very flavorful and wish I had a little more. We also had the chicken pate appetizer which was also very delicious as well.  We sat outside for dinner because there was a cool breeze that was very nice in the Vegas heat and it was fun watching people pass by. Recommend this place for families that want a nice dinner without having to get all fancied up.
Review for Friday Lunch. . We sat inside since it was quite sunny outside.  Their patio dining is First-Come, First-Serve, and when it's not HOT... it's great to sit outside and people watch. Sitting inside, it's quieter and cooler.. . My friend and I enjoyed a lovely leisurely lunch where we could catch up and gab and enjoy a wonderful lunch.  . . She had the mussels which came in a butter garlic sauce and that was truly lick-the-plate-clean worthy.  And I had the crab cake and a small side salad.  Perfect for a lighter lunch.  We also each enjoyed a glass of white wine.  (What's great is our server let us try the wine first before we decided we wanted a glass.  Not everywhere will do this... so this is a PLUS in my book.). . They also provided French bread fresh out of the oven.  So much for trying to keep it light.  The bread was great for soaking up the mussel sauce/juice.  :). . Service was professional, polite and just-right!  We never wanted for anything.  :). . (By the way, they are open for breakfast too.)
They used to have the best cheese plate here.. what happened?
Always a gem to people watch and enjoy some amazing food on the heart of the strip. Recommend the Caramelized Sea Scallops and a glass of wine :)
The steaks, frites, fish, service and ambiance were wonderful. They let you sample the wines on the buy the glass menu which is a unique treat.  Watching the water works at the Belleville across the street while dining was the icing on the cake. This restaurant is a great Vegas experience. Reservations are a must as out is hard to get a table after 7.
We had a company dinner their so I am unsure of the price per person but it was good. The appetizer with various cheeses was really good.
We went on a Friday night around 9. We had to wait about an hour, but it was easy to wait around being at the casino. I had the half chicken plate, it was delicious. The food was great, or waiter was fast and friendly. It was a great atmosphere and great  food.
Breakfast here was my first meal in Vegas. The view is amazing if you can score a seat on the terrace but even if you can't the food makes up for it. I am a huge fan of kir royales and eggs Benedict for brunch. It's practically impossible to get an real kir royale (made with creme de cassis) in Hawaii, so of course I had to order it when I saw it on the menu at Mon Ami Gabi. It was perfection. I also ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict which was amazing. Hollandaise sauce was creamy and rich but not salty. (If I could put hollandaise sauce on everything I would) The English muffin was a tad on the chewy side but no complaints from me. My friend had the strawberry waffles which she liked, and the portion size was perfect. We weren't too stuffed but felt satisfied.
Review for Saturday Dinner.. . As a girl who lived in France for half a year, I had a lot of expectations for this restaurant, which were met but not exceeded. . . The restaurant has two seating areas, one inside - which is very reminiscent of restaurants in Paris, and the other is an inddor/outdoor patio with a view of the Bellagio fountains, which was really nice planning on their part. The ambiance was really nice and the dim lighting gave the restaurant a very romantic feel.. . Now onto the food. Like I said, I lived in France for little while so I was both really excited and really nervous to try this place - excited because I love and miss authentic French cuisine and nervous because I know what many dishes are supposed to taste like. The waiter gives each table a fresh baguette in a paper bag along with creamy butter and carrots, all of which tasted just as I remembered while I was living abroad. . . For our appetizers we had the warm brie and the escargot, both of which were delicious! The only criticism that I have was that the escargot was already out of the shell, but I am pretty understanding as to why that was. For escargot newbies, dip the bread in the garlic and butter sauce for an excellent and flavorful bite! We paired these dishes with the COTES DU PROVENCE (Le Provencal), a rose from the southern part of France (which is known for their rose), and it was great.. . For my main course I had the Chicken Grandmere (or grandma's chicken) which was very simple, but tasty. . . I would definitely come here again, but maybe for breakfast.
This is a must for a great French breakfast.  Sit in the patio area.  You'll love it!!
Ridiculously good! From the skate fish to the escargot. Top notch, top notch! The steak au poivre was delicious too.
Wonderful experience, great service and exceptional food.  Only reason I did not give 5 stars is it is geared towards tourists, like everything is in Vegas. We went for a special dinner, to celebrate a special event... it just lacked the "wow" and "over the top" I was hoping for
