If you're coming to Vegas, you should stay here. Here's why:. 1) The price-to-quality ratio here is great. You're going to get a fantastic room, centrally located on the strip, for half the price of the surrounding hotels.. 2) The location is also great. You can walk indoors to get you within a three minute outdoor walk to Planet Hollywood, the Bellagio, Paris, the Flamingo, and Cesar's Palace.. 3) The customer service is excellent. The rooms don't have refrigerators but, if you want one, they'll bring one up. They give you twice the amount of towels as people in your room, and make the bed around when you leave your room.. . The only downside: the casino is where people go to die. But if you're gambling in your own hotel, you're not doing Vegas correctly.
Excellent value, excellent location, excellent people.. . The front-desk attendant who checked us in was super nice and helpful. HL at the Tequila bar was extremely kind and welcoming, had great recommendations, and really provided a lot of entertainment himself.. . I don't know that there's a better place to stay in Vegas for the price.
Stopped in Vegas again just for a night as we were making our way back home to L.A. Because our last visit was so outstanding, we did Bally's again... Truly disappointing from our first visit, and maybe our expectations were too high, but overall it wasn't TERRIBLE. The room we got was clean, but a used bar of soap was still in the shower from the previous guests. We got a nice view of the Venetian and the new "high roller" ferris wheel which was nice. No real complaints, but we won't be staying here for our next visit. It's just not as nice as the other hotels on the strip although it is in a GREAT location.
First off, I don't gamble. Even in the midst of a gaming paradise, such as this. I was here for a show, and had about an hour to kill after exchanging 1/2 price vouchers for tickets. . . This was after dinner, and my husband and I weren't looking for alcohol, just water. We ended up paying $9 for 2 20oz aquafinas from a hallway concession by The Paris. The lady was so sweet, she offered me a bag for the super hot, but impossibly uncomfortable Betsy Johnson stilettos I was now carrying.. . Still about 15min away from doors opening, we sat at the machines. Didn't spend a dime, but a cocktail waitress graciously brought 2 coffees. . . When the doors finally opened, at least 2 ushers asked us where our seats were. We meant to buy mid-range ticket, but the girl at the ticket booth misunderstood and sold us the least expensive seats. No big deal, thought we'd be able to upgrade at the Bally's box office, but not. The second usher was trying to up sell us, I thought, nope he just upgraded us to a stage-side table! That was very cool!. . The show itself was good, classic showgirl/ showboy number with lots of music, choreography, sequins, and tasteful nipples. The story line was kinda weird though. Getting the upgrade was the best part, definitely a fun experience.
This review is just for my phone experience. . . I called to be connected to the Indigo lounge since there is no number listed on their Yelp. The lady I spoke with connected me to nothing because my phone call was automatically hung up. I called again & spoke to another woman who transferred me to the BEVERAGE DEPARTMENT! Which is not even front of the house! The lady from beverage gave me a number which I've been calling non stop & keeps saying all circuits are busy, try again later. Non of the women I spoke with who provided no name for me to mention were friendly or helpful.
Do not stay here!!!  Drais across the street BUMPS all night like someone is pounding on the window.  Even The managers recommendation was to stay somewhere else when I called to complain.  At least he was honest.
For me, the stay here really depended on my room selection.  I stayed in the older tower the first night and was pretty miserable, it felt like sleeping on a rock with springs.  The room was very outdated, but large.  I switched to the Jubilee tower the second and third nights, and while the bed still wasn't as comfortable as I'd preferred, I was able to sleep and for a hotel bed I'd probably give it 4.5 stars.  The room was pretty awesome looking, very modern.  Certainly worth the extra $30 a night.. Do be warned, you will be charged an extra $23 or so a night for resort fees, which includes wifi access for two devices and gym access for two people.  I never was able to actually find the gym.. Also, in the older tower, my lungs were burning the whole time because it smelled of smoke so badly.. Overall this hotel is in a good location if you want to be on the strip, it's central to everything.  The new tower has very nice rooms.  There are plenty of restaurants (this building is combined with the Paris hotel, so you have easy access to tons of places from both).  It offers two shopping malls, and the casino is quite large.  It also boasts the strips only gay nightclub, which was tiny and didn't seem very popular.
When I first found out that we would be staying at Bally's, I was pretty indifferent since nothing about Bally's really stood out and made it appealing for me to stay at. However, I was quite surprised by the wonderful experience I had.. . Per Yelper's reviews, I requested we got a room in the Jubilee Tower, which supposedly is the new, renovated rooms. They were more than happy to give us a room there and we had a nice view of Paris Hotel and could even see the Bellagio fountain/show from across. The room itself is very clean. Bathroom is nice. Bed were comfy! There's a sofa if you happen to have extra people in your group.. . Edward (Eddie), one of the bellhop guys, is so entertaining and funny.. . I hear a lot of complaints about parking at Bally's but we always valeted our car and didn't have a problem. It is an extra plus that it's right there on the middle of the strip and close to everything! I would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat.
If I could give it a negative or an atomic bomb, I would.  Avoid this resort at all costs.   My husband and I make the trip for a week every year from Phoenix.  We have stayed at many Harrahs resorts but this must be the red headed stepchild resort.   Bad, bad, bad is this only thing I can say.   Do not stay in the Jubilee Tower unless you don't want to sleep at all.   It is across the street from the Drai beach resort on the roof of the Cromwell.   It is so loud the windows rattle and you can feel it in your teeth.   After waiting downstairs at 5 am they did move is to the older tower with broken lights and little air conditioning.   The waitresses were somewhat pleasant but the front desk and front desk managers were rude and abrupt.   They forget you are the customer and it feels like they really don't care.   Watch your bill closely as they will double charge you the resort fees "on accident" and then say they don't know what happened.   I will never stay here again and I would recommend you don't either.   Paris is nice but Ballys is the pits.
For our first time in Vegas we decided to go for the RCPM show over Labor Day weekend.  We booked our room late and everything was very expensive but Bally's had a very decent price so we went with them.  The room was spacious which we appreciated.  A nice large room, king sized bed and large bathroom.  Bed was not very comfortable and pillows were terrible.  All the staff we came in contact with were very nice and while I wouldn't be opposed to staying here again it wouldn't be my first choice. We liked that it was mid-strip but we just weren't wow-ed with anything.
These stars are for the mere fact that Bally's has two things. Star Wars Video slots which is a VERY HARD game to come by and they have it right next to Deal Or No Deal and Clue! Second, they have the best brunch in Vegas with their 'Sterling Brunch'. I have not stayed in Bally's in a very long time so I can't speak to their rooms but I want to start a trend and make the older hotels on the strip more popular...who's with me?
I've have stayed in Las Vegas many time but most recently at this casino and let tell you it's was nicest casino I've ever stayed at their new tower is really nice and clean the shower was really nice as well would definitely stay here again without hesitation unlike other casino in Las Vegas.
First, let me say that I'm a bit grumpy about Las Vegas in general. But this is about the hotel at Bally's. We stayed in the Indigo tower. I'm assuming this hasn't been renovated recently. Not sure. It didn't look run down. But the features of the bathroom and the lack of convenient electrical outlets reminded me of bygone eras. The room was clean. But there was a scent of mildew, so I could tell there'd been water damage. The shower is a bathtub with a shower curtain. Ugh. They really need to install a proper shower. There is no fan in the bathroom, so the things you don't want in a bathroom linger. Humidity, smells, etc. The Air Conditioner BLASTS air loudly and forcefully into the room. It's very uncomfortable to have cold air blown over you periodically through the night.The bed was fairly comfortable, with the exception of the pillows which were like spongey balls. It was very difficult to sleep with my head bobbling around trying to stay on top of the pillow without sliding off. There were three pillows on the bed and all three were terrible. The outlets in the room were NOT located with the modern traveler in mind. I travel with a little power strip so we can plug in our phones near the bed. But if I hadn't had that thing, they would have been on the floor, far away from either bed because they didn't leave any accessible outlets near the bed. I had to move the bedside table and unplug the alarm clock in order to plug in the power strip. . . The elevators were clean and fast and quiet. Very good for a tall hotel. The hallways were clean, bright and wide. The vending machines were irritating. I had to go to four different floors to find one that would take $1 or $5 bills. I'm NOT going to put a credit card into a hotel vending machine. Ever. And a few of those said bills only and then wouldn't take them.. . The housekeeping was competent although not very detailed. . . Checkin was a bit ridiculous. It shouldn't be that slow to check people in. Hell, you could do it with an automated system. If an airline can check you in on your phone in two minutes, surely a hotel could manage to do it in 5.. . The food court has comfortable seating. The hotel signage is good. The staff seems friendly. I didn't eat at the restaurants, except for the food court. . . The price of wi-fi is outrageous considering you have to pay per device. It's not unreasonable that a couple might have two phones and a laptop or tablet. So that would be nearly $40 a day. That's unreasonable.
