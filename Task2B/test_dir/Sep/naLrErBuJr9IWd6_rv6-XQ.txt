Expensive. Most reputable steak in venetian and palazzo.  I think it it better than delmonico and carnevino.. . Decor is more chic than the other two.  Known for having their steak charred and blackened. Quite different than their competitors. Special occasion dining experience due to price.
This place has a good vibe. I love the music they played, some good classic rock.  . . My friend and I ordered the New York Sirloin Sampler which consists of the following: . American Wagyu From Snake River Farms 4 Oz*U.S.D.A. PRIME Dry Aged 35 Days 4 Oz*True Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef From Miyazaki Prefecture, Kyushu 2 Oz*. . It was amazing.  The wagyu beef was so tender that when I bit into it, it was almost as if it dissolved. I felt the meat in my mouth with my tongue and I could literally break it apart without using teeth.  Amazing!!. . We also got 2 sides, the fingerling potatoes, which said they came with bacon but actually came with chunks of crispy pork belly, and the Nantes Carrots, Sun Chokes, Turnips, Thyme Honey. Both were good choices.. . For dessert, we got the banana cream pie. It was partially frozen which was unexpected and therefore, ehh alright. I've definitely had better.. . All in all, great quality food, high prices, good ambiance.  Would be a great place for a special occasion. So glad we went.
Can things get better than a fancy dinner in Vegas? I was in town for a girl's weekend and wanted to enjoy one indulgent meal. We decided to make a reservation at CUT since Wolfgang Puck is such a renowned chef. We were not disappointed. I started with the Crab and Shrimp Cocktail, which was fantastic. The portions were much larger than expected. They even start you off with a huge selection of bread, so don't make the mistake of loading up on carbs. In regards to the steak, we had to try the American Wagyu Beef. I ordered a Filet Mignon (6 oz) with caramelized onions and the peppercorn sauce. It was the best steak I've ever had. It was so moist and perfectly cooked. We got the creamed spinach and mac and cheese as sides, and this was way more than enough food. To top off our meal, we ordered the banana cream pie, which was fantastic. They also served some small dessert samples which were okay, but I would recommend trying one of their house made desserts.
I was here on a Saturday sitting at the bar waiting for my friend to show up before heading to the club. I put my order in and which was the Rib Eye with bone and I have to say I'm really disappointed. I know at the when they are cooking the steak they charboil it in 1200 degrees for a bit, but for my steak they left in there too long. I was pretty much all black on the outside and medium in the inside, not tasty at all. I placed an order for my friend who was running late, same steak and his came out looking much better. At this time the bartender/waiter noticed that I was scrapping the char off the steak and informed me if I wanted another one. I told him it was okay since we had go to XS and there would not be enough time. Left about a quarter worth of steak on the plate with most of my sides since it ruined my experience for a last night. Never coming here again.. . Good thing we had bottle service at the club, that made the night better.
Amazing service....food was perfectly made , will recommend eating here to all friends and family, return trip will return.
Loved it!. My husband and I came here on our last night in Vegas as our splurge dinner, it was SO WORTH IT!. . This is a place where servers brings by a plate of steak to compare the cuts. There was a tray of bread options as well and a wine list on a tablet. . . The dining room is beautiful, I thought the pillows on the seat was nice. The only thing missing was an outdoor space with a view.. . Everything is a la carte here, so be prepared for that. My 28 day aged New York strip was delicious medium rare. My husband's American Wagyu Black Angus hybrid New York Strip was delightful as well. We chose creamed spinach topped with an egg  and fingerling potatoes with bacon as sides. . . I couldn't finish more than about a quarter of the 12oz steak, so the kitchen boxed it up to go with some pretzel rolls to go with room service-eggs the next day.  A great idea!. . For dessert, we debated on going to Jean Phillipe at the Bellagio, but wound up staying for blueberry upside down cake.  It was very good, small but sharable, and the plate was dressed with "congratulations" in chocolate :)
We went here for the last night of our honeymoon, and CUT is exactly the sort of place that lends itself to that special an occasion.  It's very expensive, but you are getting what you pay for both in terms of the quality of the food and the level of service. . . The service is as over the top as it could possibly get without being intrusive.  Friendly, knowledgeable, and always on hand.  There are plenty of good wines to choose from (we both had an excellent malbec).  The food is something to be experienced... my wife and I both had a New York strip, but I opted for the American Wagyu and it was sumptuous.  We added a side of fingerling potatoes (which were excellent) and creamed spinach (which was also very good, but my wife liked it more than I did). . . Dessert here is delicious.  It isn't going to steal the show from the main course, but that steak was a nearly impossible act to follow.  The blueberry upside down cake was great way to put a finishing touch on dinner, though.  . . I highly recommend CUT if you're looking for somewhere for a truly special occasion.
This was our 5th time to Cut and it has been nothing but amazing. We always marvel in the consistency. Everything from the drinks, to food, to service has been the exact same every visit - spectacular. I'm not a steak eater but the short ribs and fish are incredible, and my husband has been ruined for any steak we can get around home. We could live off the mac and cheese and baked alaska. Can't wait to go back!
Don't need to say much. The service is perfect.. u have like 3ppl serve ur table and the wayagu steak is melt in your mouth.. what else can you ask for with a glass a red wine.. uhmm..
Cut was a special experience. It was my first time eating at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant. I went with a large group of friends. The service was exceptional, the atmosphere was fine, the space was clean and well organized. The food was superb. They had a cool selection of breads for the table, one of which was a house made pretzel roll. I really enjoyed that bread. The steak was also great and cooked to perfection. The flavors were amazing. I recommend Cut.
Amazing meal! Everything was delicious!! Even though we were a large group we didn't suffer with service. It's a fabulous menu!
I had my birthday dinner here Friday and it was one of the best meals of my life! The steak tartare, the onion bread, the whisky flights...literally everything was spectacular, including the service. We can't wait to make reservations on our next trip to Vegas!
Dined here with a few co workers in April 2011. No jacket required which surprised me considering my bill was well over $100. Felt I should have had a three piece suit on spending that much. While the meal was quite expensive, the steak was without a doubt the best I have ever had. I had a Wagyu NY Strip on the bone. It was simply amazing. The sides were delicious (I believe I had the mashed potatoes). The servers were always coming around with fresh bread and each time there was something different in the basket. Service was what you would expect spending that kind of money. Our server brought our steaks out, cut them in front of us then arranged the meat back on the plate and served us. If you feel like splurging on a delish steak this is the place to do it
We had dinner here for my Fiances birthday after heavily debating which of the many steakhouses in Vegas to dine at. We are serious Foodies, and are certainly not afraid to spend serious bucks on a delicious meal. With that being said, I do believe this is the most I have ever spent on a meal for 2 people. . . Ambiance - 3 Stars - . -Different decor than your normal steakhouse. Lots of metals/mirrors gave it a bit more of a modern feel Leather benches (if you're lucky enough to get a booth) with leather table tops were nice. We thought the decor was a bit "cold" due to the usage of sharp edges and more modern materials. . -The seats in the middle of the restaurant did not seem appealing at all. The chairs looked like something you would sit on in a conference room at your office. . -It is LOUD in here. There is not an lot of space, and the use of hard materials   everywhere causes sound to bounce in every direction. They could really use some sound absorbing materials on the ceiling to cut down the noise. We were lucky to be sitting right next to each-other in a booth, because if we weren't we would most likely have been shouting across the table. . . Service - 4.5 Stars - . - Immediately seated at a nice booth, with reservations. Wait staff was attentive. Items were brought to the table in a timely manner. Steak was carved and plated table-side along with the side dishes. Sides were also refilled by the wait staff as they were consumed from the plate, which was a nice touch. . . Food - 3 Stars - . - All of the items brought out prior to dinner were quite good. Bread sticks, cheese pastries, and the assorted bread tray. We did not get any appetizers as to not spoil the, assumed to be, spectacular cut of beef we would receive for our main course. I would give the "breads" an overall 4.5 stars. The focaccia and pretzel roll were both really tasty. The bread sticks were buttery. The pastry was buttery. And of course, the bread was served with butter topped with Rosmary and smoked sea salt. . - Main course: 34 oz. Wagyu Porterhouse for 2. Sides: Cavatappi Pasta mac & Cheese, Qubec Cheddar, Shaved Baby Squash, Wild Field Mushrooms. . - Wild Field Mushrooms: 5 Stars, these were delicious and a great addition to the steak. Generously Buttered. . - Shaved Baby Squash: 4 Stars. Nothing too special about this, but it was a good change of pace from all of the butter used on everything else. Fresh & Crisp, seasoned lightly. . - Cavatappi Pasta mac & Cheese, Qubec Cheddar: 3.5 Stars. It got old, quick. A good take on Mac & Cheese. I'm always a fan of Mac that uses more elegant cheeses than just yellow cheddar or even american, but this didn't have that "comfort" feeling you normally get with Mac. After one spoonful it gets old. Thick, cheesy, buttery. . . - 34 oz. Wagyu Porterhouse for 2, served medium-rare: 2 Stars. This isn't the first time that we have had a Wagyu porterhouse at a steakhouse, and we had high expectations. Unfortunately they fell very short. Even before choosing a restaurant we knew we wanted Wagyu. It was served with 5 different sauces. We sampled them, but normally don't take sauce with our steak - as the beef itself should be the star. . .  After all the build up from the waiter about how the steaks are 100% Wagyu, and our past experiences with Wagyu and Kobe - I was SERIOUSLY excited. My first impression was that it looked small. I would say we were served something more along the lines of 24-28oz. It was not a "pretty" cut of meat, it looked a bit beat up, grizzly, and fatty. When he brought it out my heart sank, and I immediately knew this was not going to be the mouth watering heart melting piece of beef we had set out for. . . The steak had just the right amount of salt/pepper/garlic/onion on the outside. The beef itself, however, did not live up to the hype. The Filet portion was extremely tender, and decently flavorful (for Filet). The Strip portion had around the same flavor quality as the Filet, unexpected. The beef did not have that glorious taste you would expect from a fine piece of meat like this, especially for the price. When you're paying triple digits for a steak, you expect it to be superb. The overall flavor profile for the steak was Butter. The beef was not rich tasting at all, and was actually quite bland.. . Dessert - 5 Stars - We didn't order anything, but the hotel concierge made note that it was my Fiances birthday. They brought out a generous slice of the Banana Pie which was absolutely amazing. Served on a plate with a scoop of ice cream, and Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce. Dessert was probably the best part of the meal.. . Cost - 4 Stars - It's inflated, but it's Vegas. . . Maybe our taste buds were off that night, or we actually did receive a sub-par cut of beef, I'm not sure. The Asst. GM, Matt, gave me his card and assured us the next cut of beef we received from them would surpass our expectations. With all the 5 star reviews, I would probably give it another chance.
hands down the best culinary experience of my life.. . i know i've reviewed a couple of steakhouses, but this place is by far one of the best meals i've had. my fiancee and i were super excited to come here for his birthday dinner, since we're both such steak lovers. . . we were seated the minute we arrived, which was amazing, because typically steakhouses make you wait 10 minutes past your reservation time (i never understood why). immediately, we had our waiter and another server take care of our utensils and water glasses; i can honestly go on and on about how impeccable the service was at this place. they really have all of the fine details down when it comes to customer service, which added to the amazing experience. . . we both started off with caesar salad, which wasn't on the menu, but our waitress was more than happy to have the salads prepared for us. the salad was prepared on butter lettuce, and topped with amazing shavings of parmesan cheese, creamy caesar dressing, and anchovies. you could really taste the quality of the ingredients used. the salad also came with two bruschettas topped with what tasted like garlic aioli, fresh cherry tomatoes, and basil. very delicious! we were also served different types of bread, four different kinds to choose from to be exact, and you could ask for as many as you wanted. . . for the main dishes, we ordered the 35 day aged new york sirloin, 21 day aged bone in rib eye, cavatappi pasta "mac & cheese", and onion rings (no,we couldn't finish it). wow. best steak ever. i definitely couldn't finish it all, but i did save some room for the delicious mac and cheese (i highly recommend ordering this side dish!). i'm not a fan of onion rings, but i absolutely loved these onion rings. the batter was very light and super crisp, which you don't typically find with onion rings. . . since it was my fiancee's birthday, the restaurant provided banana cream pie for dessert. the dish was accompanied with creme brulee, chocolate sauce, and roasted banana gelato; it was rich but super light at the same time.. . i highly recommend this restaurant for a special date night or celebration. you will not be disappointed.
I recommend this steak house. The steaks are delicious and meaty. I enjoyed eating  the steak. The bernaise sauce was delicious.
This is just an awesome steak house.  Portions are not too big, everything tastes great.  Had the Wagyu ribeye and it was perfection.  The corn and lobster soup appetizer was also amazing.  Thanks for a great meal!
One of my favorite places to eat.... I've been here often enough, quality of food and service is always amazing!  Explore there menu you cannot go wrong my favorite appetizer are pork belly, crab and shrimp, octopus is really good.... Steaks are never disappointing right temperature and oh my Lamb the most delicious Colorado lamb ever!!!!! And make room for the apple crusted dessert yum!
Fur einen Sternekoch hatte ich mehr erwartet. Das Personal war sehr schnell und hoflich typisch Deutsch exakt und perfekt geschult. Wir haben das Dry Aged 35 Tage bestellt. Den Cut gab es nur bis 12 oz beim Ribeye. Als als alter Steakliebhaber ist mir dieser Cut zu schmal und  so war es dann auch. Mein Resumee zu teuer fur zu wenig Gesxhmack. Wir haben in anderen Steakhausern in USA fur weniger schon besser gegessen. typisch Las Vegas viel Show und +++++ . Mehr wir 3 Sterne kann ich bei 300$ fur 2 pers nicht vergeben.
Best steakhouse that I've been to so far in Vegas.  Blows away Bellagio and Palms steakhouse.
Another great meal in Las Vegas!  A friend of mine and I had a great experience Monday night at CUT.  I started with a glass of champagne and we shared the butter lettuce salad with a champagne vinaigrette...simple, but delicious.  We both enjoyed the wagyu beef filet and it was melt in your mouth good, but very rich.  We shared the creamed spinach and mac 'n cheese sides...both of which were sinfully good too.  I don't think you can go wrong at CUT.  However, this place isn't cheap, so come prepared to spend a mini fortune for this culinary treat!
The food is really tasty here. Well seasoned steaks and side dishes dont disappoint. I highly recommend the fresh summer corn salad and the slow roasted beef. This was a meal we were drooling over, weeks later.
