Little Richies was the best thing about this place. It was our fault that we went on labor day weekend, thats why the price was a bit high but we managed. There is a staff member by the elevators who checks your room card before u can get on which was a bit annoying. The room was small with a great view. The bed was very firm. The reason why i gave this place 3 stars was the bedsheets had a handful of disgusting stains.
This place is  good. Checking in was fast and easy. The walk from anywhere was short compared to all the other hotels we previously stayed at. We had the strip view 2 queen bedroom. It was a small room with a fantastic view. The bed was okay. After pulling apart the blankets, the last layer of bedsheets had blood stains. We know it wasn't from any of us. I'm not sure if the maids just missed it or what. It just makes me wonder how often the blankets, sheets, and pillows have been left there unchanged person after person. The air conditioning sucks. I'd say the more expensive rooms would be nicer. The pool is small, so if your going in the summer then watch out what time you go in the pool. It gets super packed. We could see it from our room and the water had looked brown when there were a bunch of people in it. The shops and restaurants were really great.. . All in all I don't think I'll stay here again. I would love to come back just to visit though.
Called to book pool cabana for me and my client in town for a trade show outside of pool hours (9pm local time tonight): I was told to call back during pool hours.  The pirate show was closed but not listed on the website.  Put this back on me...this town has plenty of business, too much business and they don't know what to do with it.  (In my opinion.)  Haven't stayed here for a while for a show, quite surprising.
I would gladly tell visitors to stay ANYWHERE else in Vegas.  There is nothing good about this hotel except location and the rooms were nice.  The customer service is non-existent.   Rude workers at check in. Waiting for 15 minutes at most food places before even being acknowledged. (there was NO line) Then another 20 minutes before any service.  Pool is small and SUPER crowded.  By 2:00, you cant even move if your in the water.  Not fun, not relaxing.  There are many more reasons NOT stay at this hotel.  The prices arent even great.  Definitely consider staying at one of the MANY other hotels on the strip.  I even emailed a complaint to the the hotel direct and havent heard a thing back.  Again, horrible customer service.
We stayed here on a whim after driving through Death Valley and Mount Whitney. My friend said the rates would be really low and low and behold after checking priceline.com we got an incredible rate. I have always wanted to stay on "the strip" but was very disappointed with my stay. Check in was fast, staff was friendly, room was clean. They have a Star Bucks on property but you are not allowed bring anything purchased from any of the stores into the pool area. This was probably the stupidest thing I have ever heard of. They had two "guards" monitoring all the people for outside beverages. So if decide to buy something at Starbucks, about a foot away, from the pool entrance - think again. The pool was tiny and incredibly full. The pirate show is gone and what was most disappointing was the water has been drained from area around the pirate ships displayed out front. It was an eye sore to say the least. For the price I paid I am not going to complain (too much). Oh one more thing added on to the room rate is a resort fee...  yes, you will have to pay extra to use the incredibly crowded pool in which you cannot bring your Starbucks or anything else purchased at the hotel.
Stayed here for two nights - very average, nothing special at all. Got the rooms from Hotel.com, paid $80 with tax and the useless resort fees. The room's window were very small making the room very dark. All of the furnitures and appliances were old. Refrigerator was not working, "free" wifi was down due to technical problems, mattress cover was dirty, iron had burnt remains stuck to the plates and the television was down too. I thought about calling the front desk with these issues but didn't want to waste my time as I was there for 2 nights only. Honestly, I will not be coming back to this hotel in the future. I'd rather pay little more and stay in a better hotel. 2 stars for the bed comfort level and decent bathroom.
I had a king deluxe room on the 26th floor. The room was nice and comfortable and the bed and pillows were fantastic. The shower was clean and felt great. No complaints at all and the staff was very nice and helpful.. The pool was relaxing but the drinks out there  were a little more costly than I was expecting. $17 for a medium sized (maybe 16 or 20 oz?) frozen margarita.
Got a tower suite for 5 days. For the price, the room, service, and overall hotel were very good. The bed could have been more comfortable, but we were very happy with our stay.
One of the more reasonably priced hotels on the strip. I liked the spot on the strip where it sat, as I hadn't made it down that far before. Lots of shops next door. Once the boardwalk is done being under construction, I'm sure it will be even better. The first stay was right over the pool, which is fine if you are here to party, but being here for work, I had some trouble sleeping. The second stay (within a week) was a suite. Pretty awesome space (way more than 1 person needs). Great hotel for Vegas with lots of casino action, bars, and restaurants.
This is not a good spot if you like clean modern hotel rooms. I upgraded to an executive suite and the couch is so nasty as well the ceiling has the popcorn style. If I didn't already change one room today I would actually ask to be changed again. This is more of a large motel.
Great hotel, we stayed for a long weekend for my husbands birthday. Check in was busy but they have so many people behind the desk it was quite speedy. I was aware of the resort fee, so that was fine. We had a beautiful delux room with everything promised on the website. Comfy bed, lots of pillows, large soaking tub. The pirate show is cancelled but the ships are still there for now. Nice staff, check out was quick and easy too, and you cannpt beat the location.
The suites were spacious and had two full baths! Definitely coming back for a get away trip. Great prices for rooms
Got a double deluxe room on the 26th floor in the West Tower for two nights (a Fri/Sat). Great views of the strip (facing Mirage, Paris, LINQ, Venetian, Harrah's, etc.) and also overlooking the TI Pool area. Express check-in cost $33, extra room keys were fine. Only dined at their Pho place/coffee shop during our stay (not buffet). We were able to walk to the Fashion Show Shopping Mall via pedestrian bridge, as well as Wynn/Encore hotels. I did get a couple of sale items at the TI giftshop on my way out. Have already seen Mystere (Cirque de Soleil) during a previous stay in Vegas, but it is still their main show in addition to other headliners. The Buccaneer Bay pirate staged show I remember from way back and its Sirens of TI sucessor both have ceased. I didn't stay and play any of the slot machines this time around.
What do you call a review full of dissatisfaction? YES, you got it right if you answered, COMPLAINS. YOU!...Yes YOU My Friend! have won a 5oz. Bar of Soap absolutely...FREE!. . 1. Early checking price $40. Fine. But, making people stand in line for 1hr. 17mins. in early check-in line without any announcement of computer issues, NOT Fine!. . 2. Asked for discount(hello there's an Indian at the door) on early check-in price due to long wait. Rejected. NOT Fine! But, Free extra bed and a Champagne - eh OK!. . 3. Hair dryer full of dust. POOF right in my gelled up hair, NOT Fine! But, I still rocked the style at the club. Fine!. . 4. No ice cub picker in the ice bucket. NOT Fine! I mean, its a Suite c'mon now. NOT Fine. Call the cops on it. eh May be not.. . 5. Refrigerator died in the middle of the night. NOT Fine! We still finished all the beer. Fine.. . These might not be major issues but hey its still a minor one if you book a suite and gotto go through all this. But, whatever VEGAS trip was still off the hook. Might not book a room at TI again.. . Book a room here if you are cheap and don't care about the above issues. . . Cheers!
This is hotel is pretty standard, and OK if you don't plan to spend a lot of time there. I will say that the hotel is clean and well staffed, and pretty comfortable. . . The rooms are nice enough, again- pretty standard. The hotel itself doesn't offer very much by way of entertainment, nightlife, or dining. TI works if you're looking for a decent value and ease of moving around the strip. The good parts of TI is that you're close to Mirage, Venitian, Palazzo and other resorts that have better offerings. Everything here just feels super plain and boring. The restaurants are average at best, and there's really barely any  shopping to speak of. Meh.
I love the treasure and pirate theme here. It is a very fun experience. However, my problem was that I was made to wait for one hour when checking in and gambling was a real problem. I was asked for ID on several occasions while I was gambling on the slots even though I am clearly an old man. Why would they bully me like this?
This is the absolute worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The absolute worst service in the world. To start off with, I booked a room that had one king size bed for my fiance, daughter, and I. When checking in they completely messed up our reservations placing my family in a much smaller room with one queen size bed. At check in I complained to the manager and they showed me the smallest fine print which pretty much said "first come first serve." I found this very upsetting when I booked my family for our original room. Once in the room the issues kept stacking up: TV didn't work, thermostat was screwy, and room service was slower than molasses. Next day they gave us our original room and reimbursed us for the first night. My third night my daughter accidentally flipped off the bed then vomited all over it. My fiance called down to explain the situation and whoever she spoke with on the phone was rude beyond belief despite the situation (house keeping was more concerned of the well-being of my child). When I went downstairs to complain to the manager about the rudeness his staff presented he treated me as if I were some insignificant teenager. I was outraged and I even saw other customers in line walking out of the hotel and making remarks such as "forget this" and "let's go to a different hotel." The best thing after all of this the manager could offer me was waiving the $28 resort fee after telling him I wanted to check out now and catch the next flight home (WHAT HOTEL HAS RESORT FEES?!?!?!). Anyways save your money or spend a little extra more for a different hotel.
The rooms here are OK. They are very adequate but not special. The Hotel has a great location and is very convenient to Convention center and most other things in town. The prices are very reasonable compared to others in town. So if you are here on business or vacation and want to stick to a budget, this is a good choice.
T.I isn't the greatest hotel to stay in by any means, but if you're looking to stay within a certain budget and you want to be in the middle of the strip, the location is on point. . . It's definitely an older hotel with kind of an older crowd and obviously a gimmicky theme, but if you like to do things on the cheap it's a solid spot to make things happen. . . Gambling in T.I certainly has it's perks too. The tables have a lower buy in and are a little bit more casual than some of the other fancier LV strip hotels.
Sorry TI, I am not impressed. We dropped a grand for 5 nights. Booked a king bed non smoking. Were told at check in that no king bed non smoking rooms were available. Anything for the inconvenience? No. Got to our two queen bed room and the bathroom is dingy. As in fixture falling off in tub area. Mirrors were not clean and there were someone else's hairs in my tub. Went to the buffet the first morning, not a huge selection of items, and then my husband and I were stuck on the toilet for about two hours each with Montezumas revenge. The only good thing about this hotel was that it was reasonably quiet and the bartender at kahunaville. Save your money and go to a $50 a night hotel.
We have stayed here 4 times now and really like it! Great rooms. Great price. Just wish the bell desk and valet were quicker. We waited 45 mins for the bell desk to get our bags and an hour at valet for our car.
TI itself is a pretty nice hotel. However, the service we received was sub par. . . We encountered several minor issues that kind of tainted our whole experience.. . 1. We paid extra to check in early and to check out late ($60+). We were awoken the next day at 8am by housekeeping asking if the room could be cleaned at that time since we would be checking out. Since when is late check out at 8am? . . 2. Later that day we went down to the pool and ordered a drink at the pool bar. We asked to charge the drinks to our room... little did we know you have to authorize the hotel to allow you to charge things to your room and apparently this is done at check in--this was never mentioned to us. I suppose it's a good thing, just more of a pain that anything else. . . 3.The third thing that happened during our one night stay occurred at the buffet. Included with the resort fee that you pay is a 2 for 1 buffet deal. Don't forget to bring along the coupon in the envelope the front desk gives you when you check in or you will be accosted by the cashier and accused of not being a guest at the hotel. I understand where this is coming from, but the manner in which we were spoken to was completely unprofessional and uncalled for. Upon returning to the buffet with the coupon that must be filled out with your name and room number, we were let in. The lady did not even look us up in the system..so what was the big deal earlier?. . Overall, TI was an ok experience but I don't think I will be staying here again. The right hand doesn't know what the left handis doing here..hopefully they can figure it out.
Fun place. Always lots going on. Independently owned. Machines usually let you play which is good. Most servers on the floor are good but like anyplace, always a couple of different ones. Haven't much yet explored acting other then gaming but probably will eventually. I have seen the rooms. Good views. Nice and look new.
Clean and in the center of a lot of action. Within walking distance (if there is such a thing in Vegas) to the mall, the Venetian and more. The casino itself is on. Restaurants and shops not too exciting. But the location is great and our room was very clean and large. Would go back for sure.
Yesterday when we arrived to the Hotel we found out that for mistake we had the reservation for last week. I'm very dissapointed because when I mention the promotion on TV for 69.00 dls a room and 2 buffets free they didn't HONOR the promotion and I end up paying much more than my old reservation. Believe me that if we stay is only because the inconvenience of looking for another place. I love to stay here always but this is my last time. To  many more hotels to choose from.
