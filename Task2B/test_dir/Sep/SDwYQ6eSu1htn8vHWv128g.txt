I went here with my girlfriends on a weekday at lunch time, and we were seated right away. The wine recommendations were excellent, and the food was great. I ordered the tomato and mozzarella as an entree, and it was delicious. My friends ordered a variety of food from salads to sandwiches, and we were all impressed. Great experience!
Only missing a star because of parking. The food (esp. the bruschetta) is excellent!
Absolutely love this place! The food is amazing. So full of flavor and each meal is prepared with careful attention to detail with the freshest ingredients. Always trying new wine with great recommendations from the staff. All that combined with a fair price & terrific customer service will always keep me coming back!
My first dinner in Phoenix turned out to be a very good one thanks to Postino Arcadia. . . It's classy yet casual, good for dinner (if you're more of a snack person) and relaxed despite the more dressy ambience. . . Each bruschetta used what tasted like locally sourced seasonal vegetables. I especially loved the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes bruschetta (of course, you can never go wrong with BURRATA!). . . The waiter also made an excellent recommendation for beer (dark beer lover speaking). I forget the name but ask for the darkest beer and you won't be disappointed. . . Overall, a refreshing first time dining experience in Phoenix!
Honestly, I want to like this place more. They have a great wine menu, but I was here recently and the waitress seemed in a hurry to be done with our table (we were 2 quiet people, by the way). Also, there is no need for valet parking. Just another thing to worry about for the customer, and kind of a rip off. Next time I'll park a few blocks away.
I really enjoyed this place, and my expectations were moderately high since this wine bar is considered Yelp's 100 best places to eat.. . I came solo and had a leisurely lunch where I wanted to order both a selection of bruschetta and half-sandwich and salad combo, but upon the waiter's recommendation I just sampled one of the bruschetta - the warm artichoke spread, which was incredible, though I gotta admit it didn't come out that warm.  It tasted like it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while before waitstaff had gotten around to picking it up and delivering it to me. Ultimately it came out kind of cold, but it was still incredibly good, so I can't complain too much (except I can because I'm Korean like that and prefer it when my food is hot off the fire hot and my drinks are icy cold).. . I also had a glass of white wine which was completely forgettable, Hannah's field salad, and 1/2 Tuscan Tuna Sandwich.  I don't typically go for tuna sandwiches, but it sounded perfect, and the pickles and the mustard added just the right hint of piquancy.  The salad was nice too, though a little sweet for my tastes; all in all, it paired nicely with the tuna sandwich.  I love the kale and quinoa combo.  . . This is a fun place to come with friends, so that you can shareall of the different types of bruschetta.  If I came back and didn't order anything but a few different bruschetta, I wouldn't feel like I missed out. :)
I just moved to Dallas, TX from Phoenix, and my husband and I have been constantly seeking something that is HALF as good as a Postinos. Not only is the wine selection great, but the bruschetta is life changing. I always ask for the servers favorite vegetarian options.. . Try the creme brulee (and thank me later!)
Been wanting to eat here for a long time since I frequently go to LGO,  Chelsea Kitchen and Ingo Tasty Foods.. . Ate here on a Sunday after church,  not to busy as compared to dinner time.. . Valet service for the car which parking is very limited. . . Not a drinker of wine or beer so automatically limited our choices of the place which very much revolves around the wine selection. . . Had the Autostrada Panini with the salad and the food was just not that great tasting. There was barely any meat in the sandwich. The Panini was ok but the combination of dressing and meat was not to my taste. . . I could see how this place could have a great concept with the wine bar, but for food they need to put more effort and expand the menu.
It has a nice place that I can recommend to my friends who needs to drink and to unwind. To eat and to relax. The food is good. Personally, I love Autostrada Panini.
Postinos is a great place to go!. They have a great selection of bruschettas... They also have a great brunch on the weekends. . Their catering is also great, as my sister used them for my bridal shower. . Great wine, food, and atmosphere... love it.
Absolutely spectacular, as always. I only wish I had a bottomless tummy cuz I don't want to stop eating here. Ever. Keep it up guys !
Great vibe, great food, great wine. Get there early.
Went last evening for the first time. This is a wonderful place! We had wine, shared bruschetta and dessert. Service was impeccable. The bruschetta had fresh ingredients and very tasty and the creme brulee was delicious. Our server was attentive. Will defiantly go back!
