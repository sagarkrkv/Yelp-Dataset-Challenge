The original in New York is better due to its mystique and aura generated from the movie.  The one in vegas does not have the "it" factor and seems out of place.. . Again. Awesome desert place. Frozen chocolate is da bomb.  I had the bachelorette hot dog once. Humongous but expensive.
Fun place to take kids and out of town guests.  Inside is cute.  Desserts are the best, frrrozen hot chocolates, sundaes, etc.  Other food is hit or miss.  My last visit for breakfast, food took forever, eggs in eggs bene were overcooked.  Burgers and sandwiches are usually ok.  Nothing special and overpriced, like most tourist places. Portions are large so don't be afraid to share.  There is usually a wait so make reservations.  I've made them on the opentable app as we walked over and skipped the line.
First time we tried this place 6 months ago and it was amazing with huge portions. This visit a couple of days ago I was a bit disappointed when they were serving brunch. I didn't like much on the menu so I got the Margerhit pizza with spinach and artichokes. I was not disappointed!! Very delicious. I just wished they were serving lunch already.
Price was a little over priced for the mediocre food. Nothing truly impressing of the food, but dessert was a go. Tried out the fried Twinkie sundae, and was pressed with it, but a little on the sweet side.
PROS : . Frozen Hot Chocolate!. friendly employees (minus one). clean, casual. good food. . . CONS : . hostess at front copped an attitude . crowded (make a reservation!). tables are close together (make new friends?). . . OVERALL :. . Based on the reviews I was a bit wary of going here, but the Husband and I had a surprisingly good experience. . . We purchased a Groupon and had no problem getting a table even when we showed up 25mins before ourselected time. We strolled in a little after 1p on weekday and there wasn't a line.  Now, I'm sure if you wanted to sit outside (in the LV summer heat? you're nuts!) then you'll have a bit of a wait, but that's to be expected. One negative was the hostess who seated us, she didn't greet us nor said much. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and chock it up to her having an off day.. . On a better note, our server was awesome! He was friendly and attentive. He even told us how they made the grilled cheese sandwich, ha. He was also on top of everything, refiling our drinks, making sure we got our Groupon and Total Rewards credit/discounts. No issues here.. . Food was good (we loved the fries!). It wasn't amazing, but it was good. We saved room for the Frozen Hot Chocolate because every table was getting one or two. It was good and the regular size is more than enough for two people to share. . . Verdict? Yum! Sure this place may be a bit overrated, but so what? If you haven't been before, you should experience/try it at least once.  We enjoyed ourselves and would definitely come back.
Horrible customer service. Waitress was not friendly. Hostess was bothered when asked for an extra kids menu for my son to color on.
I have been wanting to eat here ( heard so much about this place) and finally here I'am. My husband and I stayed at Caesar and we got a complimentary frozen hot chocolate with a purchase of a meal. There was a wait to be seated, but wasn't bad ( went on a Tues @1:30pm) waiting for 15 mins for our waiter to take our orders. I ordered the Foot Long chile and cheese hot dog($17 with Total Rewards card) with sweet potato fries(additional $1) and my husband had the seared ahi salad($18 with Total rewards card). The hot dog for me I didn't like for one thing it has beans (not a bean person) I prefer Tommy's, but the ahi salad I like and for the frozen hot chocolate it's ok. I probably won't come back.
Does anyone remember that scene from "The Simpson's Movie" where Ned Flanders makes that super sexy hot chocolate and gives it to Bart? Well guess what y'all? I had that super sexy hot chocolate!!! The frozen version of it! I've been wanting to try this place forever.  I went in New York awhile back, but the nearly 3 hour wait caused me to leave.  So, I tried it in Las Vegas! Situated on the strip, in front of Caesar's Palace, it's a great location.  Excellent people watching opportunities.  We had dinner elsewhere, so we only opted for dessert here.  They are pretty pricey, but the servings are massive.  More than enough to share.  We sat at the bar, the server was friendly and poured us glasses of iced water as soon as we sat down.  My husband and I decided to share the frrozen hot chocolate, ($16) and our friend got the banana split.  The server told him that he should probably get the smaller size of the banana split, since the one he opted for was massive.  He was right! When he got the small size, it was still the biggest banana split ever.  Everything was incredibly delicious. . . The only reason I'm docking a star is because our friends wanted coffee, but were told they would need to go inside themselves and order coffee as he can't make it in that area.  So, they went inside and were told by the employee inside that the server should have actually gone in and ordered it for them. Hmm. Also, about halfway through our visit, there was suddenly an odd smell at the outside area.. The place is right on the strip so it could have been coming from there, but regardless..it was kind of gross, and I'm glad we were pretty much done by the time it appeared.
I went to Serendipity 3 a couple years ago but didn't get a chance to do a review.  I really enjoyed their service.  There was a very long line to get in.  Once we were seated, however, the food came quickly and was hot and yummy!  The waiter was really fun and cordial.
Serendipity 3 is located at Caesar's Palace. . I have ALWAYS wanted to try their Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. . . (This review is way overdue.) My husband and I came here the last time we were in Vegas. They have a breakfast and lunch menu. I ordered the original Frrrozen Hot Chocolate at $12 and my husband ordered the Thai Beef Salad at $18. The Thai Beef Salad is made up of Marinated skirt steak, iceberg, Napa cabbage, cilantro, jalapenos, tomato, Asian pickle, Thai sesame dressing, nestled in a coconut shell.. . Overall, our bill came out to over $30 for a frozen hot chocolate and a salad. To be quite honest, the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate was a total let down. It didn't really have a rich chocolate burst of flavor nor did it have a nice icy or creamy consistency. The consistency was actually kind of chalky/powdery.. The Thai Beef salad was decent and had good flavors, but the portion wasn't that big and it was quite pricey to top it off. The service was just okay.. . At least I can say I've been here and tried it. But the Chocolate Blast a Baskin Robins is so much better in comparison (which iskind of sad). . . Anyway, I don't think I'll ever return.. . 167/100 Reviews for 2014
I really hate to give this place 1 star, but I don't think it deserves much more than that after my most recent visit. I had been to this location once before about 3 months ago and it was a decent experience: nothing outstanding or overwhelming. The frozen hot chocolates are a great novelty to try, but it's heavy even for someone with a sweet tooth like me. . . Fast forward to Labor Day Monday, 9/1/2014. My boyfriend and I checked in at the hostess stand and then waited 15 minutes for our table. It all went downhill after we were seated. After being seated for about 5-7 minutes, we looked around to see if there was a server around our area - our table and the table next to us seemed to be the only ones without a server coming around. After we'd hit that 10 minute mark, I managed to flag down a server walking by and asked her if she was the server for our table. She said no and pointed at another woman who she thought was serving our section, and she proceeded to go over and ask her to come over. I saw the other woman shake her head and continue with her business. . . The server I talked to then came over and reluctantly said she'll be taking our orders now if we're ready. (No apology for the wait - it may not have been her fault, but the gesture would have been nice.) I appreciate that she was going to be serving us, but she seemed like we had totally ruined her afternoon and it just became more of an unpleasant experience. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and she had her own assigned tables to take care of - but if she didn't want to help us, she could have found a manager or talked to the hostess about who the proper server should have been.. . The waters and food came out at appropriate wait times. The Meat Madness Pizza was extremely salty and my boyfriend found it inedible after eating 1/3 of it. I got the alfredo with chicken, it was edible but for the price I had expected better flavor. Portion was large and I didn't finish more than half. The garlic bread that came with the dish was hard and the spread was rubbery. . . By the time we stopped eating our food, we were no longer in the mood to order a frozen hot chocolate. We got our check, mentioned to our server that the food wasn't great and she sorta gave us a nervous smile and walked away. . . I'm not sure where the mis-communication happened with our table and the server assignment, but I kind of wish I had gotten up and left when the idea was on the table. The frozen hot chocolate was good when I had it, but I won't be returning to this establishment again unless someone dragged me here.
Went for lunch.. . Frozen hot chocolate not as good as NY location.. . Crabcake salad decent... but not good enough for a return visit.
Came here after having dinner elsewhere specifically for the frrrozen hot chocolate and it did not disappoint! Really delicious and something I will definitely order again.
Superb decor. Outrageous deserts with huge portions and lots of options. Very well designed restaurant menus. We make a point to stop here while in Vegas. My advice: share a dessertor come hungry! Also in my opinion they should just do desserts because they are so good at it - which would simplify the menu.
Deserves No stars imo. . If all you want is a good frozen chocolate drink go get a Frap from Starbucks. . Wait staff is subpar,  except if you are a table full of only young girls then the server will flirt with yall.. Husband and wife team we got ignored.  He actually stopped dropped off water and said he would be back but never once asked for our drink order at anytime at all.. We should have left when we said but decided to order their nachos.  I can't stand places that try to fancy up nachos and ruin it.  They pile it high in a rectangular dish so only the top chips have anything.   The bottom is all soggy and the rest in between have nothing.  Hardly any cheese and that's what makes nachos.. That is all we had plus water.  . Not worth eating here and especially at their overpriced hoity toity food.
My review is solely for the desserts at Serendipity (I can't even remember the last time I ordered real food here)!. . We mostly come here for the frozen hot chocolate, which is a steal if you check in on foursquare - free frozen hot chocolate with any purchase of $10!  So last time, we decided that our $10 purchase would be a cheesecake - I know, a $12 cheesecake?? We were pretty skeptical too, but we really weren't in the mood for much else. So lo and behold, our cheesecake comes out, and it is LITERALLY the HUGEST cheesecake I have ever seen. It could feed a family of 6. At least. There were 3 of us that day and we took over half of it home. And cheesecake is my forte too.  It was seriously incredible, I still rave about it. Not just for its size either.  The cheesecake itself was a lighter/fluffier consistency than most, which normally would bother me, but it made it much more doable to eat a LOT of it. It also wasn't too sweet, which was perfect for me. The crust is a mac nut crust and though I prefer graham crackers, the nuts were pretty good too.  Like I said though, expect to be taking most of it home or back to your hotel (:. . Oh, and the frozen hot chocolate!  That's always a must if you come to Serendipity, isn't it??  Be sure you're sharing! Delicious and refreshing, chocolatey, just go try it, you'll see what I mean (:
This place is totes undelicious. I really don't want you to waste your money. This place boggles my mind because it's crazy expensive, but nothing looked appetizing that I saw.. . We ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two. If you throw some Swiss Miss in a blender with ice, sugar, and milk, that's what you pay $12-16 for. If this review sounds mean, I am just terribly disappointed. The drink was crunchy from the granulated sugar crystals that didn't dissolve at all, so I probably took 5 sips of it to verify I wasn't insane before abandoning it. It was terrible and disappointing.. . I don't know if this place once was famous for product quality, but every dish I walked by looked quite unremarkable at best. Pizzas were limp and salads were massive plates of pale iceberg. We were sitting at bar seats along the rail and had to go to the bartender if we needed anything, including paying the bill.. . All in all, "disappointment" sums it up best. Take that big cash anywhere else and get a quality meal.
My friend talked this place up big time. One star lost for the price. $11 I paid for a "Shake" basically. It was good but I'd never want to spend that much. Another star lost because the menu needs to be updated! My top two frozen hot chocolates I wanted-strawberry and mint-no longer served I was told. So I was stuck to regular frozen hot chocolate. Bummer.
This was our 2nd stop for Restaurant Week, this visit wasn't the greatest. I've been here before, for a birthday lunch, and was thrilled. This visit we came for brunch. We got to the hostess and asked to be seated outside. We were notified quickly that a table was open, the table right next to the entrance without a view that obviously no one wanted. I'm not sure if this was because we are locals, we were ordering from Restaurant Week menu, or that was really the last and ONLY table. This process had already taken longer than necessary so we did not fight it. Since we knew what we wanted we ordered immediately, the mixed berry smoothie, cinnamon bun hot chocolate french toast, and the hangover omelette. We waited for around 20 minutes to get our smoothies and another 45 to get our meals. The omelette was luke-warm in the middle and the french toast was good but soggy. The waitress was EXTREMELY nice and noticed we weren't pleased, she offered to take it back and was super apologetic(I wish I remembered her name). All in all this has not scared me away for life but I wish I had a better experience, especially after talking them up so much.
A bit over priced for the quality of food but overall everything was good, not great just good.
I wanted a burger so bad and heard good things about this place. Unfortunately on the weekend they have a brunch menu, so the only burgery was a breakfast burger. The presentation was great and the burger was good but a little plain. My husband had the hangover omlet and really liked it. I would come here again, we sat outside and had a great view of the people walking on the strip, people watching is always fun.
They did a cosmetic refurb but man! They should refurb some of the employees! I had an opentable reservation for 10pm on a Sunday night. We got there about 10 minutes early but checked in with the host who was like a robot. I said no, I have reservations. She said - the wait is 20-25 minutes. CLEARLY, she didnt understand. Anway we got there waited 15 minutes and then were seated. The waitress saw us 2x, once for our order and once to bring us the order. I got the White Frozen hot chocolate with amaretto. It was basicallly cold milk with whipped cream. . I got back from a great trip in Vegas to an email from opentable saying that we missed our reservation and if we had anymore flakes we would be disbarred ! I don't think so !! I know that the rude heffer who seated us didn't check me in on the open table reservation. . . Lets get it together, it's such a cute place that the employees should be a reflection of it! . . BTW the waitress was a hispanic girl with dark hair and an awful tattoo of 1/2 Marilyn Monroe/Skeleton with a hairy chest on her left arm.
I can't speak for the restaurant in general, but my experience walking up and getting a frozen hot chocolate can be summed up in two questions. Is it good? Yes, Is it worth the money? probably not. Even for Vegas prices.
I spent years driving by wanting to try it. Last October I went for my birthday and I was super disappointed. White chocolate frozen hot choco was too sweet and the carrot cake sundae was mediocre. I went again last night in hopes that they were just having a bad night when I went the first time. But I was let down again. The chocolate blackout cake sundae was overwhelmingly sweet once again with no depth to the flavors what so ever. I would have gotten the same effect if I made my own at home with Hershey's chocolate sauce. When I am charged over $20 for cake and ice cream, I expect it to be pretty outstanding which Serendipity 3 just can't seem to do.
You must have the fried Oreos!!!!!! Do not leave until you have this party in your mouth. Stick to dessert- the savory items don't really rival all of the other awesome Vegas options. Come hungry- The portions are the reason why we are all deemed "fat Americans!" Can't really go wrong with the dessert menu and you don't even realize that you've entered yourself into a competitive eating contest until your order's up!
I know this place is known for it's desserts but we came in for food... I ordered the nachos... The portion size was huge but unfortunately it didn't good... It was way too salty... Maybe if it wasn't so salty it would have tasted better... I'll come back to try the dessert next time
I've eaten here a handful of times since they opened. Overall the food isn't super special and honestly sometimes they come out lacking flavor or a tad overcooked. . . I'm a local and usually when I'm eating here I tell everyone the food isn't great but the desserts are good. The frozen hot chocolate is a must every time I eat here. This place is one of those places you have to enjoy at least once so I always suggest to my customers and visiting family to come here for dessert at least. . . This place gets REALLY busy due to the name and location. I suggest to call for reservations or otherwise eat at the bar ( which isn't bad at all). Service in my experience is ok . I have no complaints for their service efficiency.
I'd give it 0 stars but the burger was pretty good. To start off, at least half the diners come in the wrong door. The hostess/check in table is so confusing to seemingly even the employees. Not to mention the outside diners food goes right past everyone standing waiting for a table. So, if you sit outside know that I might have sneezed on your food. (I didn't really, but it's a possibility) after the long wait, takin to a table, tell the waitress you have a groupon and get ready to be treated like garbage and slowly! When we finally got our burgers, after being brought a water and not asked it we'd like something to drink, we were asked if we wanted our frozen hot chocolate then. Since we waited over 20 minutes for burgers I thought I better answer yes. It was brought in about two minutes. Great. Now I have a melting frozen dessert while trying to inhale a burger. . . This place desperately needs to revamp its check in process and how their employees treat diners with a coupon! Will never eat there again!
OK, the frozen hot chocolate is over rated.   I don't get it.    The desserts are mediocre to me.   But, 5 stars for the food!   My goodness, it is delicious.   I don't remember what we ordered, but I would definitely not mind coming back here again, just not for the frozen hot chocolate.. . But if you were to order the frozen hot chocolate, I would take it to go and not order in.   You get more in quantity to go and I think it's cheaper than when you dine in and get it.
Overrated. The frozen hot chocolate was nothing special and They seriously need to change the layout of the seating.
This Serendipity location is HUGE!  I have to admit that I like the smaller New York version more.  You get a 50's diner feel here, whereas I expect a small dessert-cafe feel (I know, an unfortunate side effect of the movie is expectations of fans!).  The plus is that we didn't have to wait for a table. And overall our server was quick.. . We had the hot chocolate and snickers sundae.  The hot chocolate was great, and the Snickers sundae was HUGE.  Both are large enough to share.  The fried Snickers was surprisingly good with a good cruchy crust and slightly warm interior.. . I don't know if this place is good enough for me to tell others that you MUST go while in Vegas, but if you are a fan of the movie and have time...pay them a visit!
This was the worst place we visited while going to Las Vegas.  I was incredibly disappointed on various levels of my experience here.. . First, it had been raining the day we went and while we were seated in a nice area to get a view of the fountain it turned into a puddle as soon as the rains picked up again.  One would think that they would have asked us if we wanted to move to another table that wasn't being affected by the rain?  However, that wasn't the case at all.  Instead, a few of the servers came by and laid down additional towels to soak up the water while we tried to eat our food.  This not only presented a horrible smell but really, it could have been a potential risk to the restaurant should myself or someone in party happen to slip because of the water or towels.  . . Second, the service.  Well, there was a lack of it to be honest.  While they were changing shifts the young lady laying down the towels began to complain about the fact that she always had the ethnic tables and upset that she had to work the side that was being damaged by the water and worse yet that she even had to work.  Mind you this was all in Spanish.  Low and behold, the "sweet" smile that came to fill our water glasses was the same young lady complaining in Spanish.  At this point, I was starting to become irritable.  I work in the retail and service industry, while I expect the best out of my staff, I usually expect the worse when going to a restaurant but this was starting to draw the line.. . Finally, the food.  We went for lunch and let me tell you, I could have had a better lunch at the local Denny's.  The food was soo below average.  We ordered the steak sandwich and hot dog.  I would only recommend eating a real meal at any other place and then coming here for desert.  The food here was so lack luster.  Honestly, after all the let downs, I didn't even care to try the dessert.  I just wanted out of there.... . I went for the experience, just to say I had gone.  However, I wish we would have taken our business and our unsettled tummies anywhere else but there....
Been wanting to try the frozen hot chocolate since Oprah shared it as her favs.  Waited in line for about 20 minutes.  It was worth it. G family tried 3 flavors. Original, Oreo and white chocolate.  All good!
Meh. I was so excited for the frozen hot chocolate that I was easily let down. . . No takeout until 11AM unless you go to the bar facing he strip. Menu says $11 for a frozen hot chocolate, $10 with reward card but I was charged $13! Ahhh! Why did you charge me a different price? I didn't bother asking because I'm not giving any more business to the place after this experience. . . Additionally, the frozen hot chocolate  isn't even good. Tastes like a bad version of blended Milo. No thanks.
We walked in and half the restaurant was empty, was we were excited to get in right away...or so we THOUGHT. A 30 min wait with empty tables is never a good sign. I asked the hostess why and she said the kitchen was behind. No excuse in my book. That is bad customer service. Get more people helping know the kitchen then. They didn't get our service that night.
Our food was brought out cold.  It took so long for the waitress to come back to check on our group and we were hungry because no one ate before our drive out to Vegas, we ate some of it anyway. We finally got someone else over to our table to make them aware we were served cold food, and the manager's solution was to send it back to be prepared again, so we had to wait even longer for our meal. We were already over the whole dining experience and besides we had eaten some of the cold food anyways, so the dinner was a bust!
The frozen hot chocolate is heaven, I would go everyday for that if I could. That being said, everything else is too expensive for the quality of the food, plus its on the strip and the staff is hit or miss with how friendly they are. Go for the Frozen Hot Chocolte anyway.
OMG- This place! No really, This place! Talk about killing a weeks worth of gym time....and SO COMPLETELY WORTH IT! . . Have only been for Sundaes. It is my sister-in-law's favorite place to go every time she visits LV. So I can happily blame her! LOL. . Seriously! AMAZING! Love Serendipity. I personally recommend anything with the word fried in the description! And unless you are really an big eater. One sundae will feel 2-3 people. But you will want to taste a couple different ones!
I saw 3 stars on Yelp and thought, "Screw you guys! It's gotta be amazing! I'm trying it anyway!!" Any place that charges $15 for some frozen hot chocolate HAS to be serving the BEST frozen hot chocolate EVER, right?. . Wrong. Really freaking wrong! We ordered the frozen hot chocolate with peanut butter, and there was barely any PB... the frozen hot chocolate tasted like Swiss Miss... not even joking. We were looking at each other like, "Are we being Punk'd? This can't be for real.". . Want to come to Las Vegas and get screwed? Visit Serendipity 3 and pay $15 for a dessert!!
The food here is no better than Red Robins if not worse. . . Frozen hot chocolate was good but only because we got it for free (with coupon). Otherwise, I would not have been satisfied paying $12 for it. . . Atmosphere is fun & service is good. But food here is dry, unbalanced, and basic. Everything is overpriced but I guess that's just Vegas. . . There is a groupon deal going on that made this place bearable to me. Otherwise, meh. Don't come here with high expectations.
Very disappointed. My friends and I walked here all the way the from Excalibur hotel. And the food wasn't amazing. We had to return a burger because it wasn't made to our order but it came back hecka salty. The steak and eggs sandwich looked so amazing in pictures but what a disappointment when it finally arrived. And the frozen hot chocolate? Over rated. Tastes like Swiss miss powder hot chocolate. . . I hate to give a bad review but it was simply over hyped, over rated. . . The staff was really nice though. So one star for them.
I would describe it as mediocre at best, we wont be back. Service is pretty slack, food was underwhelming. I had wayvu sliders and they were rock hard little hockey pucks nowhere near worth the $15 they ask for them. Snickers sundae was good but only had 4 fun size snickers on it, kind of a rip off, it had tons of ice cream but for something called a snickers sundae I was expecting more snickers. Save your money and go to the Peppermill for their banana split instead!. . We wont go back to serendipity!
I've heard great things about the Frozen Hot Chocolate here but, every time I'm in Vegas, I never have a chance to try it. Luckily, I finally got to try it on my last trip.. . What We Ordered:. - Frozen Hot Chocolate with no whip cream. - Ahi Tuna Salad. - Wagyu Beef Sliders. - Chili. - Sweet Potato Fries. . The Frozen Hot Chocolate lives up to the hype!!! It was soooo good!!! It was not overly sweet. I was in heaven! The Ahi Tuna Salad was fresh and tasty. My friend enjoyed her sliders and Chili! The sweet potato fries were a little on the soggy side so I really didn't enjoy them. :( I will be back though for the frozen hot chocolate!!! :)
We went here about two months ago, and I'm just now writing a review.  The atmosphere is very upbeat and fun, definitely good for a family.  We went with my 2 year old rambunctious daughter and there was definitely enough to keep her occupied.  I had a pizza which was good but not great, and we also had a GIANT chocolate sunday, which was AWESOME.  This is a perfect place to go if you want a causal lunch and are in or near Caesars.
What we ordered:. Frozen peanut butter hot chocolate. Onion rings . Crab cake sandwich . ABC burger. . Pros: the frozen hot chocolate was amazing and the onion rings batter was tasty. My husband like the crab sandwich but didn't think it was anything to write about.. . Cons: SERVICE was terrible! Worst I have actually ever experienced. ABC burger wasn't worth the money.. . I would go back to order a frozen hot chocolate from the outside counter so I don't have to deal with the awful service and  dining experience.
Yes, it's pricey. But, yes, it's delicious.. . I had 17 of my friends here last Saturday night for my birthday, and we were all pleased with the service.  We were out in two hours, which is good time for such a large party and they accommodated everyone.  Their menus are humongous, and we couldn't fit them all on the table, but like that matters.. . I even got a free happy birthday dessert.. . Yummy, classy place for dinner. :)
Getting a picture here was on the list for a scavenger hunt I was doing. We also got bonus points if someone could eat a sundae in under 2 minutes so of course we had to try it. . . The basic sundae was just ice cream, some sauce of your choosing, and a little whip cream. It was 1) very big, and B) very expensive ($12 for the basic, prices go up from there). When we got it I took a look, roughly weighed it and threw in the towel and passed it to another dude (who actually got it down in 2 minutes). . . I saw the stuff other people were eating there and it looked pretty good and they had unnecessarily large portions if you're into that. The prices were astronomical for the food too. I would never come here of my own choosing unless they slash their prices by 40%.
