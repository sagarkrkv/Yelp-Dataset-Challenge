Possibly the best buffet I've been to. I tend to shy away from buffets because I always fear and suspect the large quantity of food takes away from the quality. That for sure did not happen here. Everything was good, but since the selection was so large I'll keep it to the best parts. Even if you take 1 out of every 10 items you pass you would have to make like 5 trips to even get to the end and you still would have only tried like 10% of everything. The dessert selection and quality was restaurant quality. I am of the weird sort that thinks ice cream is better than gelato but this gelato was great, not too sweet. You can tell every dessert was cared for and prepared from scratch. The crab was plentiful and already cut so you can just peel the meat out. My biggest pet peeve at buffets is the carved meats. They are always so dry and rubbery. I had the prime rib here and man was it perfect. Moist, medium cooked, and delicious. I WOULD ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS BUFFET AND WILL BE BACK MYSELF. I was with 2 picky eaters and 1 VERY picky eater and all three of them loved it. Bartender was really nice too.
The Good:. Selection -- VAST....seriously the largest buffet I've ever seen. Asian food was uniformly good -- better than most, but not the best I've had. Service was attentive. Gelato and desserts are amazing -- highlight of the meal. Cream of mushroom soup was exceptional -- freshly made, with good quality mushrooms. . The Bad:. Much of the food is not warm (particularly the woodfired pizza that had a good taste, but cold cheese is not appetizing). Calamari is hideous -- the worst I have ever eaten. Clam chowder was like wallpaper paste (taste & texture). . Overall:. Probably didn't get our money worth, because we tried a bunch of stuff, but had a bite or two and left the rest.  In retrospect, paying the same amount for table served dinner would have been better.
Okay, some may not agree with my 5-star revieslw but is based on price for the value and quality and quantity of the food.  . . This buffet will not have the bells of having oysters or the variety of crab (crab appears at dinner time fri/sat nite), but it does have a great variety of quality tasting food.  . . I particularly like the asian soup options - they have 5 or 6 preset options (egg noodle, rice noodle tom yum, won ton, etc) but they are willing to build whatever you ask for.  Also in the dessert section they have a warmer plate for warm chco chip cookies (they are the best).   They have the standard stations: salad; pizza; meat carving with ham, sausage and beef selections; mexican; asian/chinese with a few dim sum items; sushi rolls; american with a couple of soup options; and dessert.  . . Service was good.  A little slow picking up the plates but brought around drink refills without having to ask (although Harrahs properties dont seem to have Dr Pepper or Pibb options).   Also, chefs behind the line are friendly and ask if you need help.  . . Be sure to check out my tip on getting discounts.  Otherwise be sure to get a players card (Total Rewards card) for a discount when you pay at the register.
As a local this place is a little bit pricier than most other buffets. But I really enjoyed this buffet a lot.. . My husband and I have been on a weekday and a weekend and this place is worth the price. . . It has a lot of variety! There is an asian section which includes an awesome noodle station. A Mexican station that actually offered MENUDO (which is delicious by the way) There is also a small chinese DIM SUM area too, which has things like crispy pork and roasted duck.. . The seafood section was nice as well. Crab legs, as well as shrimp. And their sushi was actually really fresh. . . They also have a pasta section which is goood as well as and awesome soup and salad bar at one end of the buffet.. . And if you like to drink they have a bar in the middle of the buffet that you can purchase drinks from.. . As for dessert, it's a nice surprise. I like the gelato which has a lot to choose from. And the dessert bar, I actually got lucky once and grabbed the last French Macaron which was also very delicous. . . And service is actually really good. They refill drinks when low and keep a postitive attitude.
This weekend my friend suggested we go here and I was more than happy to try it out. We came during their Sunday Champagne Brunch, $29.99 per person. Which considering I'm not much of a drinker, sucked that I had to pay the champage price. It would be nice if they offered two prices. One for unlimited champagne and one for without.. . Anywho at 11am there was no wait and we paid and walked right in. The amount of food available is immense. Try as we might, neither my friend nor I could possibly try everything. There was a soup/salad section, American, Asian, Mexican and breakfast sections. Also there were meat, fried, noodle, sushi, bread and dessert sections. All the hot food was kept hot (which can somtimes be a problem at buffets) and any empty or low food trays were being constantly replaced. . . Overall the food was about the same quality as most of the other Las Vegas buffets. Our server kept our drinks full and our table clean.. . The reason for only 3 stars was because I was fairly unhappy with their dessert section. I found it to be lacking when compared to other Vegas buffets. There was cheesecake, some pies, gelato, mini cupcakes and some cookies. A semi pathetic dessert section if you ask me.
Everything here is disgusting, except maybe the fresh fruit. If you've got taste buds stay far, far away. . . I sampled plenty of things including chicken, steak, veggies, Asian rice, seafood, Mexican and dessert. Something is off with everything. Either the taste is wrong or the texture is weird from sitting there too long or from being terribly not fresh because it's all frozen. Chewy chicken and spices that make you wonder if what you're eating is expired...  Yikes!!. . Frowns all around. I'm sure there are hundreds of other buffets to eat at in Vegas, not to mention thousands of establishments to get yourself a bite to eat.. . Good luck!
If you're looking for the typical buffet that's slightly higher priced like the rest this ones good for the kids but I still like to stick with Ellis Island Casino for steak and eggs only $8.99... Gotta love the old school price!!!!!. .
Back when this place first opened it was silly crowded and very very good.  I remember that this was the go to place for a buffet.  With all of the new places sprouting up the Carnival World Buffet has dropped in quality.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a nice buffet.  The food is very tasty, but over the years it always seems to have the exact same stuff.  We used to go to the seafood buffet but realized we mostly ate the crab only and the Carnival World buffet has crab and lots of it.  They are starting to crack it for you and that kind of takes away the feel for puling out a whole chunk of meat.  If you are in the area or staying at the hotel I suggest that you try it at least once to judge for yourself.
I Love me a good buffet!!! Came here on a weekday lunch.  Our waitress was nice and attentive.  The food was good but much of it was cold/ room temperature at best.   There is a vast selection but really not much more than I am used to at other buffets.  The Pad Thai was surprisingly very good as it is a difficult dish to make taste good if you are not a thai restaurant.  And the other impressive part is that they had Rice Porridge!  It is such a warm childhood memory and i only get it when my mom makes it for me.  I have NEVER seen it served in public before.  Its kind of a traditional home meal.  The dessert bar was a little confusing.  Had beautiful desserts in the glass case but yet had a sign that said, "for dispaly only" without all its counterparts available to eat.  Store bought desserts that weren't all that.    My biggest gripe is the price.  It was $22.99 for lunch!!! but all food at the Rio is horribly expensive so I figured that at least this way I get what I want for the same price as I would pay for a soda/burger/fries.  We did get a discount coupon from the Tix4Tnite booths for $2 and that knocked off $9 per person.  I would not pay more than $16.99 for this lunch buffet.
My husband and I went here on our vacation. We had never went to the Rio or the Palms, so it was fun for us to make the small trip out there. I had a Groupon for Carnival World. This was probably the best buffet we went to on our vacation. The only issue was the long long wait (we went for dinner around 6:30PM). The selection was very nice and we were both surprised that our favorite dish was a tofu dish!
