It was a fun place to stay, I really enjoyed the roller coaster!  Our room was the spa suite.  It was ok, however, for the price we paid it could have been more... We looked out over a lighting area and we had no view since they put us behind a false building wall.:/. It was ok, but I was disappointed and wished we had a view.  Aldo, the water in our room smelled metallic as well.
So this place eventually won me over because quite frankly we didn't start off on the best foot.. . Reservation was for a Park Avenue, King Bed Room.. . I arrived on a Sunday around 7:30PM and was told that they no longer had king bed non-smoking rooms even though that's what I reserved.  So they gave me a double bed room, 12th floor.  Upon arriving I was less than pleased with the room.  The desk was in the middle of the beds facing the back wall.  It was awkward.  The view was crap (to be expected for the lower paid rooms) and lastly the window blind was stuck open!  It couldn't close.  That's no fun when you're trying to sleep while the sun comes up.. . I went back down to the reservation desk to pick up my complimentary buffet vouchers as I forgot earlier.  This time I met with a different person.  I mentioned that my window blind was broken and asked if there were some way to fix it.  Instead he said he could move rooms for me and I asked if there were a King room available as that was my original reservation.  Rest assured (just a mere 20 mins after my initial check in) a King room was magically available!  I'm not sure if the original female check in person did their due diligence.. . The king room worked much better for me because I got a bigger bed (obvious) and the desk was to the side of the room.  And I got a higher floor (27 versus 12) with a slightly better view.  Everything else between the King Room and the Double Bed room were basically the same.. . It was pretty easy to walk from here to MGM, Excaliber, and Tropicana hotels.  The Hersey World store was a nice place buy some souvenirs.  I enjoyed the food court area some nights if I were a rush to get a bite to eat.  You get a younger vibe at this hotel than like...Tropicana.. . The Brooklyn Bridge area was nice to hang out and listen to street music.  . . And it was pretty affordable to stay here.  I would return.
It's your basic Las Vegas casino...nothing fancy. If I get food here it's typically Chin Chins...because of the sexy hostess that works there and their food is pretty good!! Lol Or the Starbucks.. . The bar under the Statue of Liberty light sucks...but that's due to TERRIBLE service. . . Chin chins and Starbucks...outside of that, you're on your own!
i loved the SPA at tyhe hotel Kristine and steve are excellent at nails and pedicure care i had a wonderful time and the price was right . the taxi service from the hotel was great also i had a room with two double beds very clean i would recommend this hotel to everyone that visits vegas
Recently decided to stay a night here, it was my first time staying in a room here instead of only visiting the Casino or restaurants. I was too tired to care about the price and they had only non smoking rooms so I opted for that to save an hour of waiting around. The room is only 400 sq. Feet but the space is put to good use. It has a nice feel to the place. I was impressed by just how clean it was, especially the shinny white bath tub/shower combo, and the amazing blue tile. The pull out vanity mirror and oversized ice bucket were nice settle touches. My absolute only complaint is that they have no good channels so I never watched TV, and they pump way too much house scent into the ventilation system. Maybe it would have been a nice touch for a smoking room, but to a smoker in a non smoking room, I found it fairly over powering. Check In and Check Out took forever. The express checkout kiosk was broken, and only one girl was working the desk and in no hurry whatsoever. I feel the room was worth no more than $80 all fees included. I paid $107 and felt for that I ought to of had a mini bar or fridge included for that at least. The pillows are among the best I have had at any hotel and I am picky, worth mentioning :) On another note, the Sic Bo Machines have yet to make a come back after they were yanked out, and the main staircase up to the Arcade and Roller Coaster was closed off, so you had to walk the round about way.
Surprisingly a good hotel! Not sure I would pay retail price to stay here, but when booking via priceline and getting 30-40% off, heck yeah!!. . Great place, with lots of great restaurants, and centrally located!
First of all when we checked in to our room the door didn't lock the lock was apparently broken. Really? Ugh I had to go downstairs and complain and asked the front desk to give us a different room. So inconvenient we had to carry our stuff to a different room. . . I had to ask them for and upgrade for the inconvenience. Room service is bad they charge for everything $30 for a robe per day $30 for a refrigerator. This was the first and last time I will stay At New York New York. Btw the rooms are old fashioned and creepy .
One of the older hotels on the strip, but it's sure one of the classics.. . I've never been on the famous roller coaster, but I've heard nothing but great things. It's $14 per ride.. . The rooms are typical, normal rooms. Nothing fancy. Just a regular hotel room. I do like gambling here because they are a part of M Life. If you haven't already, sign up for an M Life card, and you earn points for gambling,  going to shows, dining, etc.. You can redeem these points for food and rooms!. . I would probably stay at the hotel if I want looking to spend a lot,  but if you're looking for a nicer hotel,  go to Cosmo or Ceasar's.
"No complaints". 4 nights and no issues. Rooms were nice and house keeping efficient. Well located and walking distance if you are up for it. Deuce bus stop across the road. Lots of bars and restaurants in the hotel, you could probably never leave the hotel. Cvs next to the hotel also
I would rate this as OK. The rooms are OK, but not great. We were satisfied, but not impressed. The casino and dining are fine also. The New York feel is cool. The location is good. Overall this is a good place to stay and a good value.
Loved my stay here.  I would give it a 5, but my view was a roof with mechanical equipment.  Staff was awesome.  Everyone was friendly and helpful, including Security.  Piano Bar was a blast and made my trip.  Very fun place to stay.
I went through several casinos during my recent visit to Lost Wages, and NYNY stands out as the most . . . um . . . different.. . When I saw pictures of the exterior, I always thought "cheesy".  Wnen I saw it in person, I thought "cheesier".  If I would have booked a room, I might have thought "cheesiest", but I'll leave that to people who did sleep here.. . I love roller coasters, so I planned to go on this one.  Then I got to the entrance, and found that it's $14/ride.  That is beyond steep.  I didn't ride.  My coworker, who was also in Vegas at the time, told me that she did ride it a while back, and it's so rough and throws you back and forth so much that it hurts.  At my advanced age (I've been 29 for many years now), I don't feel like booking a chiropractor after riding a roller coaster.. . Now for the good:  The Hersheys store.  Like World Of Coca-Cola and the M&Ms store, this one is overpriced.  But you can get a Hershey bar customized with your name on it.  And it has a chocolate Statue of Liberty at the inside entrance;  cool.. . New York New York:  a good resort hotel to walk through if you want an "only in Las Vegas" experience, and if you want to hope that what's built in Vegas stays in Vegas.
Only reason I gave them 1 star is their Sports Book.  Completely unprofessional and rude, In the middle of the 4th quarter they changed the Monday night football game to Americas Funniest Home Videos. We asked for them to change it back and they just refused.  Then the manager came out and bitched at us for complaining.  Who comes to a sports book to watch AFV?
Been here for four hours, still waiting for room that I reserved. Crap service, rude employees, and it hasn't even been one day.
We went to family nearby who proposed NY, NY for decent clean sensibly advanced, upgraded lodging. They were correct. At the cost we paid, quality was great. Was NOT loud whatsoever... yes, we heard thrill ride and incidental exciting ride clamors... be that as it may nothing excessively noisy. Restaurant choices were phenomenal... while numerous other of bigger super-uber become mixed up in-them inns around NY, NY had just smorgasbords or extravagant consuming alternatives, New York, New York offered about six or more boutique eating choices... counting Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, Starbucks Coffee, a sandwich shop, and others. For the price we got, we're really happy and would return.  Not five star, but then we didn't pay for five star either, great value!
Loved the New York New York. Staff was friendly, great service, hotel room was clean and beautiful. We had a view of the roller coaster and also the MGM grand. We were able to check in early, our room was ready for us which made it very convenient to drop off our luggage and freshen up before hitting the strip. Casino and restaurants were great as well! Definitely had a great stay!
My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary. We booked our room months in advance and requested early check in, which you pay extra for. When we arrived at the hotel our room was not ready and they told us then that early check in is just a request and it is not guaranteed available- even though we paid for it... It was such a hassle to deal with the front desk and finally after much back and forth the girl who was helping us got a manager who (kind of) took care of us and got us in a room.... Not the room we requested .. It was on the back side of the hotel.... But none the less we got a room. That did not start our trip off on the right foot, but we rolled with it. . . When we finally got to our room, I heard a loud constant noise.... They put us in a room that was next to some kind of generator (?).... Electrical (?).... There was something in there and the entire trip we had to deal with that constant high pitched running noise... . . We ventured out to check the place out.... Originally from NY, I was super excited to stay here.... But I quickly realized that there was nothing to be excited about. Customer service at each and every shop/restaurant, etc was HORRIBLE!!! . . Let's start with Greenwich coffee.... We went to get a coffee and I asked the rude girl for a mocha. She asked me what size, and I asked her what sizes do you have? She said small or large.... I asked 'well what size is your small and what size is your large?'.. Her response with eyes and mouth wide open with a head bob was 'we have small.... And we have large...'.... Umm that's okay and I put up my hand and said 'actually, I'm good'... She walked away without a second thought.... FYI little girl, when I asked what the sizes were I was hoping for the ounces, so I know how much I would be taking in. Never gave that place a second thought.. . Went to the other coffee place 'Il Fornaio' and they were much better.. The girls were nice and the coffee was good. They get really busy and they handle it OK. I was a little frustrated one of the mornings when I went and ordered 2 small vanilla lattes, one regular and one decaf.... When I got them I tasted mine and realized there was no vanilla. Being really busy I went to the barista and asked if there was vanilla and she said no they were regular, I asked her to add it and went to the register to let the girl know, my exact words were 'I don't think the girl heard me ask for vanilla so the barista is fixing my drink but can I pay for the difference?' She said not to worry about it but 'next time make sure to ask for it'... I was only fairly annoyed with this because it was obvious they were busy but that's the exact time you need to hone in and listen to your customers orders, it was clear to me that neither of the register girls listened to me.. They were overwhelmed, but they were polite and accommodating. . . Nine fine Irishmen... Went in there and waited about 20 minutes for our server.... Ended up getting up and going to the bar instead.... Bartender was cool, not the best bartender but he was nice. Food was AMAZING... We went back here a few times this trip for the clams... . . Did not know they had a 24 hour shop in the hotel. This would've been nice if someone had told us at check in... It was unfortunate we toughed out midnight heartburn after drinking so much and didn't see this shop until the day we left. Really front desk people--- would have been nice to know that was there!! . . Okay let's talk about the casino... Craps dealers were talking about their weekend the whole time and missed paying us out at least 3 times during our game. That was really not cool... Don't waste your money at this casino... If you like the ambiance of Vegas and to people watch, go somewhere that's busier and more professional. The casino was empty by midnight... Was not worth it. . . Went to il fornaio restaurant for breakfast one morning and server dropped us some water and disappeared.... So long we ended up leaving and going off site for food. Luckily we tried this place again and sat at the bar and had really good service and the food was really really good.... . . All in all, the food here is good.... But the service sucks. Definitely better places in Vegas to spend your money.
Stayed in the Empire tower. Sad, tired affair - saggy sheets, hairs in toilet, smells from wash basin, beat up elevator. Everyone of the toilets on the casino floor was spattered with feces. Food options are sub par.. . Until management has the decency to do a major upgrade, they should not align their name with that great city.. . Yuck.
I've been coming and staying at MGM resorts for some time now. Have always had a wonderful time but this last time was a complete let down! Not only was the hotel run down and elevators all dirty but I swear I had bed bugs in my room. I woke up with bites all over my legs and spoke to management about it. This is the first time I go with my infant since having her, I'm just happy it wasn't the baby that got bitten.
