Not a buffet I'd go out of my way to visit again- really a 2.5 stars rounding up. I love the Wynn and there are some solid dishes here but service was practically nonexistent, and for a weekend special brunch ($40pp), the execution should have been higher.. . Most impressed with the seafood: smoked salmonmelted in your mouth, plentiful fresh shrimp with cocktail sauce are my go-to, variety of mini sushi rolls to pick from, baked red snapper dish was divine.. . I loved that they had a dim sum section, but everything was overcooked: paper wouldn't peel off bottom of barbecue buns, gyoza were falling apart, fried shrimp rolls were stuffed with shrimp but flavorless.. Many options for dessert, but I'm not a sweet tooth so it didn't sway my initial ratings. Best items were the PB-chocolate-pretzel ice cream and profitroles.. . Prime rib was tasty (as it is almost everywhere on the Strip) , lots of brunch options I had no interest in taking advantage of (pancakes and omelets made to order), but many things clearly sitting out or not cooked properly: eggs benedict with watery eggs, several condiments that didn't get refilled, etc. It wasn't til we were about to leave that they even refilled the empty lox trays, which is ridiculous for a brunch buffet.. . Speaking of refills, drinks at our table were only refilled when we asked. Empty plates were cleared, but waitress acted as if drink refills were simply not her job. Very bizarre.. . Would go to the Bellagio buffet instead in the future- lower price point, higher quality and more options, better service by far.
A few years back, this buffet was sold as "The Best Buffet in Vegas."  A few years back, it was.  However times seem to be changin'.. . Good news is, the line seems to have greatly reduced, perhaps there are obvious reasons for that.  Interesting to see them wanting to monetize the waiting process.  If the line does become long, you can opt-in to pay an additional $9 each to move to the front of the line.   Where else can you monetize a buffet line other than Vegas, right?  Seemed a little tacky.. . We went to the buffet on Friday morning after our flight in.  We got there during lunch time.  The buffet was "fine" and "adequate."  I didn't find it overly special or exciting, but knew the Saturday Brunch Buffet would be super!   Went there the next morning, and it was about the same as the day before, just a lot more money.  The food all seemed to be dialed in.  I was extremely bothered to pay so much money to be met with powdered eggs and floppy bacon.  Breads were a bit stale, the dim sum was limited, soggy and lackluster.  Overall, I was completely disappointed and most likely won't return.. . Hope they can make some quality changes to make things the way they once were.
One of the best buffet ( besides Caesars) on the strip! Especially the breakfast is awesome! Don't miss ur if you are there!!
Great selection and very delicious food.. The waiting at line was awful though. We waited like an hour and a half and while we waited breakfast changed to lunch... Ughzzz
Very beautiful environment! And they have heavenly desserts! Love the food and the place.
Best buffet in Vegas in my opinion. Definitely the best buffet for vegetarians. Had vegan tofu scramble, vegetarian tamales, vegetarian enchiladas, vegetarian spring rolls, two kinds of Asian mixed vegetables, fruits, oatmeal, grits, coconut and berry concoctions, yogurt. Lots of non-meat options. My husband's an omnivore and he loved it too. The best buffet and it's not even the highest priced. I would recommend it to anyone.  . . P.S. The desserts were good too. Loved the profiteroles and lemon tart. Can't go wrong with gelato. Kids would like the rice crispy pops and candy apples. . . P.S.2 Breakfast is the cheapest option. Prices go up for lunch and up again for dinner.
Their selection is absolutely extensive.  The quality and taste are the exact opposite.  We tried about 15 things & only 2 tasted good!  $35 makes it definitely not worth it.  Bottomless mimosas though for $10, i believe.
I only ate here for brunch and let me tell you I was NOT disappointed!! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the food, oh my...the food was unbelievable.  By far, the best brunch I have ever and probably will ever go to.  They had such a gigantic array of food that I got overwhelmed just looking at the different dishes.  They even had whole turkeys and prime rib that you could choose from, fresh ice cream - not the vending machine kind.  Everything tasted fresh and you could tell that it was quality food.  Some other buffets lack in taste because they have to cook such a large quantity, but not here.  Seriously, words can't describe how much I recommend this buffet.  My cousin said that you have to go to the Saturday brunch, since any other morning they only serve breakfast items.
. . 
I like the food here, but I don't think that it's worth the price especially for dinner.   It's not that worth it.. . I do love their meat and dessert selections.   But the rest are mediocre to me.
i was expecting more for the high price. I don't mind a high price if the experience is memorable. Unfortunately the food here was lacking variety and taste. We went for breakfast and I felt like everything was geared more towards lunch which is not what you want at breakfast. The food was very cafeteria tasting, which some people really like but for over 20 dollars its just over priced. They did however, offer great service!
***** Lunch buffet review *****. . Bottomline: Don't come here for lunch. . . While the variety of food may seem plenty, it really isn't. Let's count:. 1) Salad / soup . 2) Cheese and salami . 3) "Seafood" (blackened salmon, red snapper). 4) Pizza. 5) Italian (mac and cheese, ravioli). 6) Bread. 7) Meat (no prime ribs, only beef/pork/turkey). 8) American (fried chicken). 9) Bread (that's right, 2nd bread station that looks exactly like #6). 10) Mexican (quesadilla, tamales). 11) Chinese (fried rice, potstickers). 12) Fruit / yogurt. 13) Sushi (california rolls). 14) Bagels . 15) Desserts. . Each station has about 3-4 items and half the items look unappealing. The seemingly okay looking ones taste pretty bland. In fact, good luck chewing anything you put into your mouth. Obviously this place doesn't really care about the lunch eaters as they churn out uninspiring crap from the kitchen. Even the desserts were almost inedible -- I have never seen such poor selection of desserts and they taste horrible as well. Spend your money elsewhere or wait until dinner buffet.
We had the buffet at the Wynn on a Friday for lunch and were very disappointed. The selection and taste of the food was mediocre at best. The $25.99 price per buffet was definitely not worth it and we felt ripped off. We expected much more.
So dissapointed. Will not revisit!. $50pluspp. Setting; Yes it is quite beautiful,  bright and very clean.. . . We mada a 20 minute walk in 90Degrees from the Vennitian hotel, with high hopes.. . We waited in line for 50Minutes,  then when we were seated we didn't get our beverages for 20minutes.  I actually had to ask a bus server for a glass of water for my daughter.  . Maybe they were short staffed?. . Food was ok not great. . What I ate;. Pot stickers were soggy, chicken soup bland, meatloaf ok.... Sushi roll soggy. Cheese plate (Cheddar cheese). Bread pudding and Anglais sause a winner!. . . My only repeat station was the antipasti station, ( cheese salami, pesto, and toasted bagettes.) Sadly had a few bites of my selections and didnt finish most of my choices.. . It was a Sunday and they were definitely busy, but the quality was not pesent, I far prefer Bellagio.
I came here right after I landed in Vegas last weekend. Lunch was $58 for 2 people.  Honestly the options especially on the premium side were lacking. I'm talking no prime rib instead pork loin and turkey. Salmon hand rolls were ok.  Crepe station only for dinner. My standouts were the great hand scooped ice cream options, pork and shrimp dumpling station and the pizza with a cooked egg on it. For the price the bellagio has better options for lunch if you ask me. You don't have to take my word for it, go to both and the ceasars buffet and decide for yourself.
3.5 stars.... . I guess 2014 has now seen the 3rd round of cutbacks (I have been coming here for years so it's only why I notice)...if you look at the pics of some awesome looking stuff and expect to see it on the buffet you'll notice the pics were most likely from 2009-2010. . Round 1 (2009). Take away the king crab...replace with snow crab. Take away rack of lamb...replace with lamb loins. Round 2 (2012). Take away lamb loins...replace with kobe beef. Round 3 (2014). Take away kobe beef replace with street tacos. . Also some obvious replacements were a huge ramen noodle station in place of something I forgot what used to be there. Didn't see one person in the whole 90 minutes get an entire bowl of ramen noodles...because you just paid $40 to eat more expensive food..so why would you?. . The fish was way overcooked...all 3 different fish that I tried. Mahi Mahi, blackened salmon, even the sea bass...and it's hard to overcook sea bass.. . The prime rib was decent.. . Yeah, I'm doing a lot of complaining because it's not what it used to be in it's heyday but what really saves this place are the desserts. Probably the best buffet desserts in town (aside from Bachannal)...high quality desserts (see pics). Throw in a strawberry crepe and 3 profiteroles and that capped off my 8000 calorie meal. . . I really thought of giving this place 4 stars due solely on desserts but if I gave it 4 stars, did the 2006 version of the Wynn buffet deserve 7 stars?. . "A-ok" I'll be coming back.
I'm here with 10 people and we are each going to write a mini review! Ps everything is amazing!!. - best service! Thank you Lisa!!!!. - the baconnn mmmmm. - everything is super fresh and the service is excellent. - I must to come eat at the buffet wynn. Thanks god for America!!!!!. - So I'm gluten free and I found sooo many options. I had the blue corn pancakes which were amazing. Unfortunately, Angela, the lady making the pancakes had a really bad attitude but thankfully the chocolate chips were sweet enough to change the bad taste in my mouth. Also the baby carrots were unreal, the chicken sausage was amazing and the iced coffee was delicious!! I also loved our waitress she was SO nice!!! . - Thank you for the amazing service Lisa. The omelette station was incredible! Along with the chicken sausage. For dessert I highly recommend the carrot cake and the sorbet. . - Wow first of all the fried chicken was amazing!! Highly recommend it. The shrimp is bomb but the cocktail sauce is aight. Do not get the orange juice it's really sweet and doesn't taste natural or fresh. Also stay away from the sushi you should go to a sushi restaurant if you want bomb bomb sushi not a buffet trust me.. -fav part if breakfast was the yogurt parfait. Also, they had blue corn pancakes for those who are gluten intolerant. Ice cream looked really good just was too full to try!
Decided to eat here for breakfast before we made our way back to Los Angeles. . . EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!. . Never going to eat here again and never going to recommend anyone I know to eat here. . . Initially, the price you pay ($47.00 for 2) didn't seem too bad. You expect it to be that price. It's a buffet right? When you take your first lap around the buffet you'll notice how dismal the selections are. There's breakfast cereal... BREAKFAST CEREAL!!! I just paid $23 to have fruit loops?!? Then that's when you realize the price is ridiculous. . . If you continue on you'll notice each station has some sort of an egg dish. Lobster frittata, scrambled eggs, egg white only, eggs benedict, and then an omelet station?!? Who can eat so many eggs and how lazy do you have to be that you can't come up with any other dish other than plain egg whites?!?. . After bypassing the numerous egg dishes and the prepared cereal bowls of frosted flakes and fruit loops, I went looking for the lox and bagels. I find the station and a line of people thinking that maybe the lox are really good. I remember them being pretty good so I make my way over to the line. I get to the line only to find that people are waiting for the staff to put more lox out. The woman in front of me says that she's beenback and forth from her table several times hoping that they had replaced the lox. She went on to say she's been waiting for at least 40 minutes. 40 MINUTES!!! We ask the man behind the glass to put more out and all he says is "more coming." Yes we know, but WHEN?!?. . This is where I decided to tell my wife to finish her plate and to stop eating because we were going to wait 45 minutes at our table drinking only our coffee and juice and drive off to go have breakfast elsewhere.. . Seriously people... DO NOT WAT HERE!!!
My family and I came on a Friday night and each person cost about $40.99 and with tax out to around $44-45. The place was beautiful and the decor and placement was fancy... But the food was JUST OK for the price. Not too much/good quality seafood.. Their meat selection was pretty good but that's about it. Their desserts are very limited too. For the high price and "fancy status", it was pretty disappointing.. I expected so much more especially since their casino/hotel has a "luxury" feel to it... . Not worth the money.. For just about $5 more you can go to The Bacchanal buffet and it is honestly the best, most amazing buffet in Vegas. Wynn buffet is honestly just worth $20. save your money!
Part of the reason for my recent Vegas trip is because my dad wanted to try this place after hearing me rave about it from a previous visit and because he saw this buffet on a travel show.  Also, as I said in my original review I consider any Vegas trip where I don't eat here a failure of a Vegas trip.  While this buffet is still the best I've eaten at (pending trying any of the other top of the line buffets in Vegas), I have to dock the Wynn 1 star for this visit unfortunately because the crab which in my previous visit were giant legs and the meat easy to take out was not the case this time.  The crab, while still a decent size was not of the same quality as before and were definitely smaller and with less meat.  The fresh oysters while tasty were not shucked properly which led to a little more effort to get at the meat which considering the quality of this place shouldn't have been an issue.  Overall, those were my only complaints as everything else was simply top notch and delicious as I expected of this buffet otherwise and I think I freaked my dad out with how much food I put away, including two plates of desert (come on, with so much good stuff to choose from for dessert, how could you not take two plates?)
We decided to visit the Wynn while on our honeymoon.  I was so excited to eat at a restaurant at one of Steve Wynn's hotels because I heard he was vegan and all his restaurants were very vegan/vegetarian friendly.  We did not do a regular dinner there as we already had other places booked so we decided to try the buffet.. . We thought we were going to breakfast.  Perhaps this was our fault for not reading the sign more carefully.  It was brunch when we got there.  So, in addition to the $16 a piece we paid to get into an express line and bypass the hour wait it ended up a lot more expensive than breakfast.. . The problem with this and any buffet I have visited is that it so hard to eat the amount of money you paid for.  It was over $100 for my husband and I to eat.  There are only so many pancakes, bagels and cupcakes one can eat at once.  I would have rather had another fine dining experience for the amount of money we paid.. . With that said, for a buffet this was pretty good.  For me I was glad to see an abundance of vegetarian friendly food for me to eat and some of it was labeled vegan.  I thought that was very cool.  (I just don't think it is worth the money).  For everyone else there are of course traditional brunch items like bacon and whatever else usually shows up.  . . Next time I visit Vegas I would love to return to the Wynn and eat from one of the other restaurants.  To me I would rather spend $100 on the dining experience.
