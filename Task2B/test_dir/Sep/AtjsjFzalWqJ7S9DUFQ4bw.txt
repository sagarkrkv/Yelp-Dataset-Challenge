I just LOVE LOVE this place! Stayed about 5 times here now. I'm an Identity member love the perks wish we had a little bit better perks to rooms but hey maybe in time. Gambling here is the best I go hours with out noticing, drink service is awesome, Every time I come one particular cocktail waitress always remembers my drink. Shes pretty amazing I believe her name is Shar. Wicked spoon hands Down best Buffet on the Strip. So worth driving from Phoenix.
Best hotel in LV....literally. I've stayed in almost every hotel/casino in LV so I kinda know what I'm talking about. . Great decor, great food options, great rooms, comfy beds.. Milos is an absolute must...best restaurant in LV hands down...impeccable service and food quality/preparation. . The casino isn't stinky and smoky like the rest of LV .... Pool situation: great, because you have options. I go to the quiet one because fist pumping and crazy loud music just isn't my thing.... Art...there is cool art all over the place. . Full room service menu 24 hrs a day...love it.. Go there...oh and just a little top...the SLS hotel may the newest on the strip but it might also be the lamest...avoid if u can.
Just wanted to express my appreciation for this hotel! I had my second stay here yesterday (a year a part from each other) and it was just as good as the first. Very consistent! . . I didn't have a chance to hit up the main pool last time I was here, and really enjoyed lounging at the Boulevard pool this go-round. It was chill, but still lively and had decent music (surprised us, as we are both snobs and my bf is a dj haha). The people were great too. Good vibes. Great hot tub also!. . Special thank you to host Michael for the incredible view from our 1 bedroom terrace. It truly made my boyfriend's first time in Vegas very special. See you soon!
love this hotel.  have stayed 3 times.  but i digress.  . . If you LOVE THE SMELL in Cosmopolitan (and who doesn't ---- it helps balance out the ubiquitous inevitable second hand smoke and booze stench in all vegas casinos):. . GRAB SOME WOOLITE DARK, OPEN IT AND TAKE A HIT.  . . You will be magically transformed back into a world of hipster suites with terrace balconies overlooking the 'lagio fountains, long-ass lines for the subpar Marquee club, and a buffet of inefficient plating (*where the only "wicked" involved is the fact that the dishwashers have THAT many extra plates to wash). . Whenever I miss Cosmo I'm gonna wear my favorite "clubbin" shirt that was washed in woolite dark, take a deep breath in of the fabric, and pretend im in a better place .....
The only negative thing about my experience staying Labor Day weekend at the Cosmo is that I can never ever stay anywhere else in Las Vegas again.  From start to finish my experience at the Cosmo was 5 star.  . . Some friends and I decided on staying the weekend in the Terrace Balcony rooms, which is so worth it.  The views are absolutely amazing at night, and the size of the room was really nice.  The hotel in itself is stunning, very modern, without being over the top, very classic, appealing to both men and women.  I really liked the organization of the hotel, and the layout.  Literally, all weekend I had whiplash with all of the very beautiful people milling about.  I didn't know where to look first! . . The staff and service was also top notch, from the waitstaff, to the check in to the concierge,  and everyone in between was super friendly, and responsive. . . Honestly, I could have stayed there and never had to leave all weekend, honestly, the only time I did was to see a couple of shows and a dinner at Nobu. . . What I really liked about the hotel is that it appealed to different demographics.  As a 35 year old, I felt completely comfortable, although there were lots and lots of 20ish people running around.  Sure, the Cosmo is a bit more pricey than other hotels, but so absolutely worth it.  Without a doubt, I will be back.
The Cosmopolitan was very disappointing. Our biggest let down was how dirty the entire place was. For what we paid for a room, we definitely expected the place to at least be clean. Service is pretty crappy as well. Finally, this is not a place to go and feel relaxed. It's a club and party scene, not for couples looking to get away or families. We just didn't expect that since it's not cheap. . . We arrived early and had to wait in a long line to check in. After waiting, we finally got to the front of the line. The check in process was quite easy and seamless. Since we were there early in the day (about 12:30 pm), our room wasn't ready, which is what we expected. We were told that we would receive a phone call when it was available - between 3 and 5 pm. The call came promptly at 3:02 pm which was great.. . Meanwhile, we figured we would get lunch at one of the many restaurants onsite. Our friends chose Milos. The food was mediocre, but the bill was pretty steep for lunch. The menu was pre fixe three course meal. There were no complaints, but everything was pretty standard. The lobster in the pasta was pretty chewy and subpar. Service was also a little off and pushy. Not so laid back and relaxed. Definitely had a certain way of running things - drinks took forever as well as dessert. . . We wanted to hang out at one of the many pools afterwards, but found ALL of them to be a party, club-like pool scene. We were told that the Bamboo pool was more laid-back and great for relaxing. We headed there and it was definitely not the case. It was so packed and obnoxious. . . The room and entire hotel was pretty dirty as well. There were many places that the dust was piled up and obvious. The windows hadn't been cleaned in a long time and even the shower glass still had fingerprints on it. Not up to standards of a hotel that charges $300 a night in an area that you can get a room down the street at the Luxor or MGM for half of that and have a clean space. Drinks were also over-priced.. . If you are looking for a trendy, party spot, this is it. Otherwise, STAY AWAY! Dirty, overpriced and pretentious!!!!
Rooms at the Cosmo live up to the price.  . . Comfy bed. Tub for two. Spacious shower. Separate bathroom. Living room area. .. and my favorite, balcony with a view of the Bellagio Fountain as well as the strip. . There are plenty of clothing shops, restaurants, and bars within the hotel that are also great.
I am giving the Cosmopolitan 2 stars and I will chat about both the good and the bad.. . The Good:  I love the environment.  The rooms are great and most of the staff are helpful.  There are plenty of food choices and good shopping.  If you are looking for a great place to sleep this will do.. . The Bad:  It deals with doing events at The Cosmopolitan.  On two occasions, events were done here and both went less than stellar.  The main problem was invited guest's rooms should have been posted to a master bill, however half of them had their personal cards charged.  It took days to fix this issue.  Equipment that had been sent to the hotel took hours to get to the meeting room, while we waited to set up.  While, like I had said most of the staff was accommodating, one of the front desk managers was extremely rude.  While I would have been okay with it being me that she was rude to, it was one of the guests we had invited.  She may have been having a bad day as part of the issue had something to do with their computers.  The agreed upon price for rooms were also wrong.. . while I think that staying there as an individual would be fine, they won't be getting event business from me again.  I have other choices in hotels that take great care of events and make those events effortless and flawless.
Sexy, upscale, sleek, chic and sophisticated  old school glam with modern lines, The Cosmopolitan does not disappoint! . . Highly recommended and with great reviews, Cosmopolitan had one essential feature I wanted for our Vegas honeymoon destination; a great pool. In fact, it has three including one that bills itself as "toptional". Cosmopolitan's and more specifically Marquee's concept of this differs widely from mine, by the way, but this does not cancel out the fact that everything is absolutely gorgeous!. . Located mid strip, close to the shops at crystals, and across from miracle mile, it's super convenient for shopping. Several great restaurants are on the premises, and although we got to experience only a few, I feel confident in saying the food is EXCELLENT!. . Staff or Co-stars as they call them, are all very courteous and accommodating!   From allowing a very early check-in to having our room cleaned outside the schedule, valets, and room service, everyone we met was great. We booked a city room and were given the opportunity to upgrade, but I was more than happy with our accommodations!. . My favorite room feature was the floorto ceiling glass wall of the shower! This way you're never without a view, from either direction ;)
There are a few reasons why the Cosmo is my favorite hotel if I have to stay on the Strip.. 1) If you stay in the West Tower, you don't have to walk through the casino.  You check-in and then the elevator is right behind you.  This is a HUGE bonus for me since I'm in town for work and walking through the casino is a drag.. 2) The rooms are modern and comfortable.  I feel like one person did the design for Caesar's, Palazzo, and Ventian... so it's nice staying somewhere that is arranged differently.. 3) Beds are SUPER comfortable.  Although I hate feather pillows... . 4) The gym on the West Tower (14th floor) is open from 5am until (I think) 8pm.  I'm a morning gym-goer and have had no issue getting a machine.  The gym is also really clean and the staff is friendly.  One downside is that the women's bathroom smelled like someone had died and they'd tried to cover it up with air freshener.  (Seriously seemed like a plumbing issue.). 5) The Cosmo has several fun bars sprinkled through the lobby -- one right by registration and then the Chandelier bar, etc.  Again, everyone is friendly and it doesn't reek of cigarette smoke.. 6) The Cosmo has some of my favorite restaurants on the Strip, including HOLSTEIN'S.  I love that place.
My wife and I stayed at the cosmopolitan during our last Vegas trip. This was our first time staying here so we were excited to see how the rooms looked. We initially thought we booked a room with a balcony and little kitchenette but found out that they did not have this room available when we checked in due to us booking through my wife's conference room block. This wasn't a deal breaker but it would've been nice to see it. We did luckily end up getting the view of the bellagio water show. This was a plus as we got to watch the water show from our room everyday. . . The room was nicely decorated. The bathroom shower had a window to the room. There was a curtain that you could pull down to put some privacy as well. It was weird that there wasn't a clock in our room or a radio. Not sure if it was just missing or what. We just had to use our phones to see what time it was.. . The casino is decent. The table games get kinda pricey especially at night and on the weekends. I like playing low limit tables but +$25 gets too pricey for me. They had a lot different games to play. Not a bad layout.. . The restaurants are on the second floor as well as the wicked spoon buffet and a few shops. They have a nice chandelier bar at the front of the casino next to Las Vegas blvd. . . It was really nice staying here as it was walking distance away from a lot of places. All in all, I would probably like to stay here again. If you stay here, make sure to try to get the view of the bellagio water show!
Another visit to the Cosmopolitan and it remains my fave LV place to stay! . . The Casino is beautifully decorated and makes you feel glamorous just by being there! The service is always courteous and competent. They don't kiss your butt - most exude an air of confidence because they know they will take appropriately good care of you. This visit, they bumped our room which was a bummer because we were with another couple. Though it was a slightly nicer room, this meant they were stuck with a sofa bed...so the Cosmo ended up taking $50 off our bill. Withmy casino rate, we were able to upgrade to Fountain Views for little to nothing extra plus received $150 in resort credits which we gladly spent on a late night Room Service meal. If you want Room Service, get it and you will be pleased, I promise. It will take 30-60 mins but everything we have had over multiple visits has been as good as most restaurants.. . The rooms are all decorated with the same touch of glamour. We have stayed in a few different rooms and have always opted for the Fountain View. Totally worth it. The view of the strip at night is gorgeous. One other thing I love about Cosmo is that everything above their basic rooms offers a balcony. If you haven't noticed, that's rare in Vegas. For me, it's pretty important. . . The gaming here is on par with any other nice casino. They have a plethora of bars and restaurants to check out. I've been to most of them and they are all nice and every place we have eaten at in the Cosmo is fabulous even their version of a 24-hour diner...they have some incredible Truffle Tater Tots.. . Marquee is the day and nightclub. I've been a few times at night...Saturday night ran us $70 per couple which was higher than Drais but at least you aren't totally blocked off from the pool area. What I dislike about Marquee is that it's run by Tao so it's not really part of Cosmo. So, the only perk you have of being a hotel guest is a slightly shorter line. But, that's Vegas.. . We saw the Bamboo pool from above and it looked nice and relaxing. It would be the appropriate pool for kids or those that don't want the pool party scene. We opted for the Boulevard pool and are happy we did. It was a mellow pool party compared to what I imagine Marquee would be like (or compared to the always popular Hard Rock Rehab party), but it was still a pool party. It was for hotel guests only so things stayed small. Kevin Hart was here for the weekend so he had bikini clad chicks walking around and supposedly was giving out free mani, pedis and massages. The downfall was that the pool closed at 5PM so they started pushing us out at 4:45.. . Bag check is always quick and I admire how efficient the Taxi guys are...they keep the Taxi line moving so you rarely have much of a wait. . . Until next time, Cosmo.
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!. . I live in Las Vegas, and I LOVE coming to the Cosmopolitan! . . I have stayed here with friends when they were visiting from out of town and really enjoy the accommodations. Beautiful decor and very clean!. . I've have also visited the Cosmopolitan many times for drinks and dining. I it is a beautiful property and I always enjoy their customer service!
In LOVE with this hotel!! I recently stayed at this hotel for a bachelorette party in the 2 bedroom city suite. The pictures of this hotel do not do it justice!! The room was absolutely ineradicable and on the 45th floor!! So large and had the floor to ceiling windows with views of the Bellagio fountains. The walk in showers were fantastic and the beds were very comfortable. The TVs even have XM radio! The room surprisingly came with a pull out couch which was perfect, all of our guests were able to get a bed. The mini fridge comes fully stocked so there really was no room for our own drinks unless you take everything out. . . The Boulevard pool was a great, but hard to find with the two towers. We ended up getting buckets of beer (5 per bucket) for about $37 which I felt was very reasonable. They also have small cubbies along the edge of the pool to put belongings in since all of the chairs were always full. The pool its self was deeper then I expected but they have ledges all the way around to sit on.. . All of their employees were so helpful which made checking in and out so easy. This hotel is by far my favorite in Vegas. May be pricey, but well worth it. I cant wait to return!!
Amazing  luxurious and fun Casino.  we stayed here with a bridal party and had a blast, night clubs, food, casino, rooms all top notch.   state of the art technology in the rooms, great views, balconies. Great rates had friends at the ariea and we had the better hotel!! favorite on the strip
LOVE! Favorite hotel on the strip!!! Everything is fabulous! Stayed for 5 nights with our 9-month old while my husband was attending a conference. Service was excellent all around. At check-in, the West Towers were recommended since it was a little quieter with amazing balcony views of the bellagio fountains & strip. A complimentary crib was delivered within an hour of arrival. The rooms are beautiful & spacious. No smoke odor throughout the hotel. All the restaurants were surprising baby friendly with highchairs available! We even took the baby with us to the Bamboo pool which had a sophisticated crowd yet relaxed atmosphere. Perfect central location with easy accessibility to City Center & The Crystals with the Sky Walk. The garage also conveniently features green lights over available parking spaces.
Fav place to stay on the strip! The balconies are my awesome on a cool night. Great staff! Love Chico in VIP, Vance the bellman and the valet guys are superb! Awesome views of Bellagio fountain!
Definitely the glitz & glam of the strip.. Literally! Its shiny interior with endless/giant chandeliers sparkle from front to back. . . Everything about this hotel is so appealing.. with its bright and sexy decor, modernly designed bars, fancy suites with balconies and panoramic views, and the atmosphere you see in James Bond films.. . I've been fortunate to have stayed in the Wraparound Suite twice. Huge room, perfect for groups.. and with the entire corner balcony open to the view of the center of the strip, it's pretty amazing!. There was one king bed but so much living room/sitting area to crash in, that it was not problem to fit a group of 7. The one Summer weekend we were there, some of us slept on the couches in the balcony.. You can't beat the view from here, day or night. The Cosmo is located in the heart of the strip so you'll have some sort of nice view wherever your room is.. . I love the bars here, especially Vesper. They make some fine cocktails and use top-shelf, fancy-named liquor.. . Marquee is one of the more popular day/night clubs in Vegas right now.. always a fun but crowded time.. . I think the Cosmo could have better restaurants. Wicked Spoon Buffet was good until Bacchanal opened and killed every other buffet. I like Secret Pizza though.. it's quick and pretty good(amazing when you're drunk).. . Don't come here to find lower limit table games.. especially on the weekends. One time there were only $25 craps tables going on.. . A great hotel all around, don't double-think about staying here.. it's definitely worth it! It'll be hard for any other hotel/casino to top this.
My best friend and I just spent this past weekend at The Cosmopolitan for the first time. We had the 1200 Square foot wrap around terrace suite and it was beyond beautiful. We by far had the best view of the strip, especially at night. The hotel is BEAUTIFUL, the casino was immaculate! It's very pricey but so worth it if you can afford it. We had an unforgettable time.
First *legal* stay in Vegas, and I left satisfied.. . My cousins and I stayed the Cosmo for a joint 21st birthday celebration. This hotel has this modern, glamorous and intimate feel to it as opposed to plain ol' glamorous many newer hotels have. And lemme tell ya, modern and elegance creates a very 5-star experience.. . The hotel appeals to a younger, hip crowd with its modern stylings and classy decorations. Older guests, tourists and families are obviously welcome, but don't expect to feel a relaxed and old-fashioned vibe many other casinos hold.. . Upon check-in, we decided to upgrade our rooms to Terrace Studios (2 queens) with a view located on the west end. The hotel rooms were a bit on the smaller end, but nonetheless given that Cosmo touch: modern with the glam & glitz.. . It should be worth noting that the Cosmo sacrifices comfort in exchange for atmosphere. Our room albeit incredibly fancy did not have that comfort and homey feeling I've experienced in other hotels. Is it a bad thing? No, not exactly. But it's something worth pointing out.. . Also, the room I was staying in was fairly dirty, something I wasn't expecting from such an extravagant hotel. There were spots and dirt in the bathtub, questionable marks on the floor and, the worst of them all, disgusting stains on the balcony chair pillows. We couldn't remove them either since they were attached to the chair, so we had to flip them over and deal with them. Yikes!. . However, aside from all the dirt, our party decided two key factors that made our stay pleasant: the balcony and the convenience.. . The balcony in the Terrace Studios is amazing. If asked, I highly recommend upgrading to rooms with views facing the fountains. You won't regret it. The view is absolutely breathtaking and makes the perfect picture-taking opportunity for any time of the day. There's just something about soaking in the view with a drink in hand that really adds on to your experience at the Cosmo.. . As for the convenience, the Cosmo is located smack middle of where all the action is. It can be hard to leave the hotel since everything you need is in the hotel or near the hotel itself. Need cheap dining options? Right across the street are some fast food restaurants. Need to pick up a few items from the store? Walgreens across the street has *almost* everything you need (for the right price, anyways).. . Staff here are friendly but a bit slow. The front desk did manage to send people to our door whenever we needed something, but it wouldn't arrive until maybe half an hour to an hour later.. . Casino is nice. Definitely not as much variety with the slots, but there's a respectable amount of table games. Tables are especially hot at night.. . All in all, the Cosmopolitan is definitely worth checking out. Everything is decked out in a chic and elegant flare, something only the Cosmopolitan could only pull off. As for staying at the hotel itself, it's worth staying here at least once. Just like their tagline, the Cosmopolitan has just the right amount of wrong.. . By the way, have you guys smelled the hotel's second floor near the west end elevators? It smells like soap. So good. They should sell candles with that scent. I'd buy 100.
I feel like this is the most glamorous spot on The Strip.  From the super chic and glitzy decor and the uber-blingy chandelier bar that makes me squeal with excitement each time I walk through - I love the Cosmopolitan... . . Luckily, this visit to Vegas I actually got a chance to stay in their rooms for two nights. I'm thrilled to have experienced it and was totally bummed to return home to my dull master bathroom. . . We are already plotting to turn our bathroom into something that makes us feel so decadent.  . . This will now be our choice hotel to book while in Vegas.  And did I mention they have an actual balcony?! Unheard of... it's so rare to actually get fresh air while staying in a hotel room - this was so nice to have the window open while lying in bed listening to the buzz of the city.  . . Love it! Cannot wait to return!
Cosmo is impressive walking in. My family and I were excited upon checking in. I came with my senior citizen parents and my sister who was attending a medical conference. The studio was great in looks, but found out 5 of our lights didn't work!!! WTH?! 5?!!! We had someone come in and change them, but they said the reading lights above each of the beds weren't going to work throughout our stay, because well, they don't have any in stock. I have a feeling they don't plan on ever changing those suckers out and they're broken for good. We got comped $100 food credit for that, but really, if you're paying for the studio and you're there for a conference, I know it's vegas, but both reading lights above the bed?!!! those were the only lights that were above the bed. I've stayed at the Aria and the Trump and come to vegas almost yearly. This was a first. We were on the west end and it looks like this the more quiet tower and definitely the one that gets less love in terms of upkeep. The carpet outside of the 41st floor elevators looks like its buckling up and already in bad shape. Not good- the Aria is an older hotel and it doesn't look like this. The elevator video screen was perpetually broken and had handprints on it all day long. however when we used the east tower elevators, they were clean and videos working fine. . . We also used the pools- it was great. But if you're looking for a real pool experience where you swim in water taller than 4 feet, book yourself at the Aria where there are three real pools where people can actually swim in. The pools here were more for drinking and walking in and mingling. It's definitely a more party, youthful vibe, although it was all ages at the hotel and pool. My dad and I were the only ones swimming in the pool. hahaha. . . Parking experience here is much better than at the aria though. That was very helpful. You just get in an elevator from parking and you're already in the casino. Not true with aria or Trump (trump has the worst parking situation- only valet with no true parking lot connected to it). . . I would stay here again for convenience (parking and location). But don't plan on being wowed with your actual room (maybe bathroom) and don't be surprised if the carpet in the hallways looks yucky or if your lighting isn't working.
It's really a shame that I have to give the Cosmo one star because I really did enjoy my stay there. What I have not liked is how they have treated me since my stay. Prior to my stay we had a price set (it's in my confirmation email) of $1017 and with tax figured it would be about $1100ish. It was for the Wraparound Terrace Suite (which was really nice). When I was checking out of their hotel, I tried to do so on the TV until I noticed a charge of about $3300 (3x agreed amount). I called down and explained what I had in my confirmation email and they said stuff about upgrading twice (only did once), so I figured it'd be best to go down and explain.  . . I came down and spoke to the cashier and he brought up these two upgrade fees (again bogus) and other fees totaling the $3300, in which case I showed him the confirmation email I had received. I told him that this is what I had agreed to pay for the room and wouldn't have booked it if it was going to be that much. I was not going to pay more than what I had agreed to. He spoke to the head cashier who was behind him and then went and talked to someone hire up behind the scenes. . . While the original cashier was speaking to someone in the back, the head cashier was nice and said we would get it taken care of.  The original guy came back about 10 minutes later stating that they (the Cosmo) had messed up and they were going to remove all the charges that had been added on and I was just going to have to pay a little over $800 (I had put a deposit of $320 a couple months earlier) for the remaining balance.  I'm looking at the receipt as I type up this review. Everything seemed fine and we were on our way back to NYC. . . Now, a couple weeks later, I'm looking at my bank statement to find a charge for just under $3300 from the Cosmopolitan. I called to speak to them but they are saying in a phone call that I agreed to this amount.  I had got cut off in my original phone call and had to call back when booking and that's when I agreed to the price in which they sent me in my confirmation email ($1100 roughly). I have the email and the receipt from when I left the hotel and never authorized this ridiculous charge but they are yet to refund me the approximate $2500 they overcharged me. This cannot be legal and I now have my bank looking into it. They really have put a damper into the vacation experience there. Well, back to Encore we go.
Classy and top of the line.   The Wynn has the best mattresses hands down but the Cosmo is easily 1b you will sleep like a baby...... Probably has the best entertainment anywhere in Vegas and easily the best shopping anywhere in Vegas you could go here and never have a need to go anywhere else
We were impressed with the Cosmo.  We have stayed in several other Vegas hotels and were excited to try this one out.  Its beautiful on the inside and the rooms are nice and spacious.. . We upgraded to a room with a balcony and view with the Japanese bath tub.  That was all very nice.  I enjoyed the patio which faced Aria and the tub for relaxing.  The room was pretty clean (I went through with anti-bacterial and wiped everything down).. . Overall the gambling, food and drinks were quite expensive but that also means a lot of the lower class and/or partiers stay away :-). . Its centrally located so you can easily walk to other casinos.. . The various restaurants although expensive were very good.  The buffet is disgusting and a joke, would never go back.  The Pablano restaurant is super yum but the portions are small.  The burger place is also very good with yummy milkshakes.. . Mid way through our stay we upgraded to a view of the Bellagio fountains and that way fun!  We got to watch the show and watch people.  Only bummer was that room was slightly dirtier and the patio was pretty gross (needed to be clean- used q-tips were out there, etc) and the phone didn't work by the bed.  We told the front desk about it and they seem unconcerned.. . All in all we would most definitely stay here again.
If You Like Noise, Drunk Kids, This is the Place for You. . . The Hotel in general is very nice but with 20 and 30 something drunks kids stumbling all over the hotel, the unusable public restrooms.  If you got rid of that the place would be great but they are catering to these kids with the all day and night clubs, and they simply do not have enough staff to keep the public areas clean with all these slobs!!!!
An very nice, but extremely overpriced experience.. I have been to vegas man times and this was the first time at Cosmo.. Lobby = Nice. Rooms = Nice. Casino = Athletically nice, but awful odds on certain games. i.e.  BJ paid 6:5, which is just awful odd. Plus no poker room.. Price = Way over priced. I wouldn't go back unless I got some kind of "deal". Henry's was a nice place for breakfast, but pricey.
My best friend and I visited this resort for 3 days and have a new favorite spot!  The surroundings are divine, you hear fun eclectic music throughout....the best part though hands down is the staff!  We were met with cheerful, knowledgable and attentive staff wherever we went.  Will definitely be returning!
Super modern hip looking hotel entirely. The hotel for young aged adults. I was surprised right when I entered the main casino entrance. The illuminated columns gave you the illusion that a lady was on the other side (inner of column). Room had a great night view.
This is my new favorite hotel in Vegas. Really efficient and service-oriented check-in/registration process - they come over to get you in line and also have iPads at the desk so you can browse while you're waiting. . . My room was upgraded to one with a balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountain and had a small kitchenette with a fridge/freezer and microwave. The room was huge with a sitting area, two TVs, and a large bathroom and shower. Everything in the room is very modern, perhaps almost too modern given that it was hard to figure out how to turn off all of the lights. . . The common areas of the hotel are beautiful, especially the bar with the huge chandelier. For those people who like efficiency, the parking garage with color-coded lights by parking space is a sight to behold.
Ok so I love vegas and I have been to most of the casinos.  I really like this newer one as it has a nice vibe with adequate and a nice gambling floor.  There are many different styles of restaurants so I am sure you can find what you are looking for.  I did not stay here but I will next time.  I like the design and the way it is decorated.  Stop in for a drink and see what you think.  I have a feeling you will stay and play!
I had the pleasure of staying at the Cosmo to celebrate me and my cousin's 21st birthday. . . The property itself is beautiful: starting from the lobby which changes the scene via screens every so often, as well as the vintage yet modern art scaping the halls, to the doghenge, giant heels, etc. There is also this fantastic smell that hits certain part of the hotel. If they sold this scent, I would definitely buy it to put in my room, car, bathroom... it's great! Fat Tuesday in Planet Hollywood, Walgreens for all your alcohol and convenience needs, and a McDonalds, Subway, Panda Express are all very closeby for quick bites to eat.. . The service: good. The front desk agents were very helpful and walked out from behind their desk to welcome each guest they were helping in -- not something you see at every hotel. The lady we spoke to was very kind with answering all our questions and in trying to accomodating our requests (such as asking for both of our rooms to be to each other), although we did have to pay an extra fee per night to get a view of the Bellagio fountains as we were booked in the Terrace Suites. This upgrade fee was definitely worth it. Whenever we called for more towels or other items, it did take quite a while for the items to get to the room but I understand it's a large property. Also, phone operators were very knowledgeable and helpful. Only thing I must complain about is that housekeepers come knocking on your door to clean your room early in the morning... 8am? I mean we're in Vegas, where most people are probably hungover in their room each morning. Also, elevators are pretty slow.. . The room: we were booked in the Terrace Suites, but upgraded to the City View Terrace Suite. The bathroom is huge... probably the same size as the area the beds were in. What is awkward though is the shower will have you completely exposed so if you are sharing the room, you will need to lock the whole bathroom and everyone's access so they won't see you showering away. There was a living space area, and two TV's that you could ask for a free audio jack to plug your phone in and play music to (perfect if you want to blast music while pregaming.) The beds were so-so, nothing special and weren't the most comfortable in my opinion. The balcony was awesome!! We got to watch the Bellagio fountain show every quarter past the hour from our room, and there is a seat outside where I helped myself to take a nap one afternoon.. . Nice property, the opportunity of a balcony looking out to the heart of the strip, and being in the middle of the strip... not bad Cosmo, not bad. Thanks for making my 21st fantastic!
I love how unique this place is. It's different than any hotel I've ever stayed at and is delightfully a little trippy. This marks my 4th separate time staying at the Cosmopolitan. I'm not a crazy gambler, just happen to have conventions here on a regular basis. This is a fantastic place to have conventions. Every time I come, I recognize how much better this hotel is for conventions than other convention hotels. . . Let's dive a bit deeper into the pros and cons of this hotel. You'll notice that I didn't give it 5. There are a few things that are consistent and could be taken care of. For one, although the lobby is fantastic and welcoming there is always a line to check in. It usually takes 10-20 minutes of waiting in line and being mesmerized by their animated pillars, but nonetheless after a long flight and holding all your luggage you don't want to wait in line for anything. When you do get to the front of the line, the people checking you in are always fun and helpful. It is apparent that there is some kind of issue with their check in computer because every time they're confused by my reservation. We always get a roommate and almost every time they have to ask for help to get the right name on the reservation. Overall, the process is painless but it's still a little annoying to have the same problem multiple times in a row. . . Next is the room. Getting up the elevators and having a fun and personalized key card makes this experience personalized and fabulous. The elevators are fun and quick. The first impression of your room is also quite trippy and fabulous. The beds feel like clouds and often you have a view of the water show.  This may not be the style of a room that I would decorate my house, but it is very sexy, fun, trippy, and comfortable. I especially love the showers. If you have a random roommate or are not here with your +1, make sure you have the screen down! :) If you're sharing a room, make sure that you take showers a bit a part because they're prone to drainage issues. Very annoying there is no coffee in the room. Very annoying that they'll charge you if you touch the snacks/mini bar. . . Convention- service and food has been top notch every time I'm here. The wifi is free in the main events and it is an ideal place for around 800-1200 people. I absolutely LOVE the Chelsea theater as a concert hall and a place for a key note speaker. I saw Brad Paisley and the acoustics were fantastic as well as providing an intimate feel. One of my favorite concert venues of all time. The lighting is excellent, acoustics spectacular, lots of places to sneak away for a good conversation, clean and large bathrooms, and an overall great atmosphere. . . Bars- Marquee is fun and keeps up with this whole theme. The Bamboo pool is fantastic. There are lots of fun shops, restaurants, and terrific modern art that decorates the halls. I'm a big fan of this place. I had an issue in my room this last time and they took good care of me. I'm not going to go into details because it was taken care of in a swift manner and I'm already over it. . . Overall- excellent hotel for a convention, fun place to come on vacation if you have the $$ for it, and a terrific place to see a concert. It's not perfect, but this themed hotel is one of my favorites.
LOVE THE HOTEL... on the strip and the Marquee is FANTASTIC. Had a block of rooms for my sisters bachelorette party and had the time of our lives. There were 20 girls and I booked 5 of the double suites. The shower was large enough for 10 of us to fit in. There was a hot tub in the bathroom and large marble floors. The living room had a nice large area for me to play games with the girls and extremely specious. cars were complimentary parking and the staff was amazing. . I would recommend to stay here for a special occasion because the rooms are much larger and the service was nothing short of amazing.
First time we've stayed at this hotel - it was great. Not amazing like I feel it should've been for the name and the price hence the 4 stars. Service was good, had a really long hold time anytime I called room service or concierge - I know it was a busy weekend but they honestly seemed like they couldn't handle the volume. Everything was pretty hectic around the hotel the whole stay. We were on the 59th floor so view was 5 stars though
I've stayed at The Cosmopolitan quite a few times now, every time with a high floor fountain view and its be wonderful! However.. We just stayed here for my girlfriends birthday last week and were "upgraded" to a different room than what I had booked. Sounded good at the time but what we ended up with was a room with the view of a roof (literally only 20 feet between us and the roof to Marquee[I think]) and a Japanese bathtub that was pretty awkward and uninviting. After many many great stays at the Cosmo they definitely dropped the ball this time. Time to search for the next great experience that Vegas has to offer! It's been real Cosmo.
Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in at Vegas.   I've been here twice and the first time was incredible. Everything was new and wasn't worn. This was about three years ago.. . Recently stayed here again in March 2014 and August. The place was a little runned down. Don't think its still worth $300 a night.. . Last visit was a little irritating checking in. I drove four hours from LA to Vegas to expect my room to be ready. We get in to check-in and they told us we'll have to wait because our room isn't ready. Now, what pizzed me off was that I told that check-in isn't till 3pm. We were there at 3:50pm. The lady had the audacity to tell me "just because check in is at 3pm, it doesn't guarantee for it to be ready." Which is bull shyte. I'm paying, booked way in advance, followed the policy and was checking-in after 3pm. How could it not guaranteed? . . I finally threw a bissh fit and asked for a supervisor. She also came along and told me the same thing. I told her the same story from the lady before and kept at it for a good 10 minutes. She finally said "oh, there's your room!" They upgraded us for free to a Terrace suite with hot tub, balcony and city center view! . . Can't complain any more!
I am seriously IN LOVE with this hotel!!  It is so beautiful, trendy, modern, youthful and intimate.  They have everything you need, you don't have to ever leave!  I wish I didn't :(. . As soon as you walk-in the front desk lobby is rows of giant floor length LCD screens that are so cool and chic that you literally exclaim, "WOW!" I love all the bar areas too, they are covered in chandeliers, it's sooo beautiful and classy...just FABULOUS!!!. . I stayed in a suite with 2 full baths, full kitchen and a washer and dryer! I mean WOW! Rooms were beautiful and every room has a balcony with a spectacular view. It over looks the Bellagio watershow.  I LOVED IT! Room service was also delicious...I got a Nutella Stuffed French Toast with a cornflake crust uhhhhh YUM! . . The casino is smaller than the other hotels which I liked it more quiet, it made the experience more intimate and not crazy like the other casinos.  Most of the dealers are nice and fun too.  There's a small section next to a bar where they play loud music while you gamble and there are go-go dancers dancing on the table which was super fun...it just hypes you up even though you are losing all your money hahaha! I liked that the hotel did not stink of cigarettes too, they have a super fancy ventilation system.. . They have Wicked Spoon as their buffet which carries a lot of items you don't expect to find at a buffet.  I loved the asian section, they put the fried rice in mini Chinese to-go containers and also have duk bok gi!! If you're Korean you know how rare that is to find at a buffet!  So they have an awesome buffet, room service and also an array of restaurants to choose from.  Whether your in the mood for a nice steak, sushi or a burger they got you covered. Do yourself a favor and find the "Secret Pizza Place" located somewhere on the 3rd floor and get the "white slice" YOU'RE WELCOME! I dream about this pizza and miss it dearly.. . The pools are nice and quiet. The east pool "The Boulevard" is bigger and plays music but it gets packed and you won't be able to find a seat if you're looking to lay out because most of them have a drink minimum so try to get there early.  I liked Bamboo on the West side because it was one floor down from my tower and they had seats floating in the water you could just lay out on. It is a more chill smaller pool.. . So we got pools, bars, buffet, restaurants...what else? Oh yeah they have stores to shop like a huge All Saints.  Then they have a walkway that connects to the mall across the street and Planet Hollywood.  If you need a Walgreens, that's across the street too.  What else you need? Oh yeah, if you want to go to the hottest night club in Vegas they have Marquee located in the hotel too.  I didn't get a chance to check it out, but the line was insane for it when I walked by.. . Ok so I think I covered everything, all I have left to say is that if you want the best experience Vegas has to offer, you MUST stay at the Cosmo!  Seriously the nicest hotel I've been to in Vegas so far and will be the only hotel I stay at from now on.  I stayed 5 days and was soo sad to leave :( I didn't want to leave! So if you're planning a trip to Vegas...stay here! I have nothing bad to say about this hotel and I've worked in the hospitality industry so I am critical. So BRAVO COSMO BRAVO! Seriously FABULOUS
The Cosmopolitan Casino and Hotel was first class in most every way. Dinner at STK was fabulous.  The Casino was clean and didn't smell of smoke or deodorizer as many of the older Casino's smell. We stayed three nights. The room was well large and included a large walk in shower and garden tub.  Our balcony overlooked Belterra and we had a beautiful view fountain show and lights on the strip. The only downfall was with hospitality.  Our room was not restocked with tissue paper and bath soap. The pillows were too soft for us and we about bought some firmer pillows during our stay. The Cosmopolitan offered great gaming and and fun atmosphere for the young people looking a fun mix of gambling and night life.  The girls dancing on tables made it a bit difficult to focus on blackjack hand!
Supposed to be a fairly new hotel but you can see the chipped glass doors and dirty carpet by the entrance.
My new favorite hotel for vegas! I was pleasantly surprised when I got my room. They gave me a view of the Bellagio fountains which was amazing. I was there with many friends and they had parking lot views, so they came to my room to watch the fountains. Will definitely return next vegas trip!
