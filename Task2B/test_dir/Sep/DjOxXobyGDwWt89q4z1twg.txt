Will have to definitely check this place out again when in Vegas...that is all :)
Their ramen flavor is actually pretty good. The reasons I gave a 3 star are because: long waiting line and the broth too salty. We couldn't finish the whole bowl even tho it's not big portion. Too too way too salty. Not worth a 30 mins waiting, and the environment isn't good cuz too hot, can't feel any AC inside of the restaurant. If there's no Kung fu tea next door to distract us from waiting we'd probably leave already.
I guess it's good for Vegas!  Thank goodness we didn't have to wait too long for ramen that is just ok!  My husband got the tonkatsu ramen, had no idea it didn't come with an egg (everywhere we eat at they give you an egg) so that's odd.  Then we tried the soup, wayy too salty.  My husband added water, about half a cup to dilute it, tasted so much better.  There really is no service.  We sat down, ordered and paid and that's pretty much it.  Don't expect to much.  We came in with high expectations because of the reviews, but left disappointed and hungry!
Alright Monta, after 2 reviews, I gotta give you guys the 5 stars. As mentioned in my previous reviews, this is by far the best ramen house in Vegas. That alone counts for a lot. They put a lot of care into their food, which I under appreciated in my previous reviews. Yes, I still think service is sometimes a hit or miss, but lately its been great the past few times I've been here. Hopefully, this is just consistent and not my amazing luck. Also, they listened to their customers and opened up a new location in Henderson. I really appreciate restaurant owners who lend an ear to their customers and act accordingly.. . Not much else to say about Monta, if you are looking for ramen in Las Vegas, you've come to the right place.
Ohmylanta, I can't get enough of Tonketsu Shoyu ramen!!! I absolutely love Monta. I'd eat it everyday if it was healthier. I've been there a million times (literally) and it's always packed full of people. It's a testament as to how awesome their food is. They also are quick with the service so the wait is never really that long. On top of the bomb food, their prices are super legit. Monta definitely deserves 10 stars as they serve the best ramen in town!
I love love love Monta Ramen.  Their food is so fresh, healthy,  and FAST!  The place is ALWAYS packed which means to me that I'M not the only one who  thinks so. This has to be the most popular ramen house in LAS Vegas.  I get the Miso Ramen often BUT there's on dish with lots of bean sprouts that I want to try.. looks so yummy! ! My lunch partner had Tonkotsu which of course I tasted... she put corn in it which was brilliant!  Can't wait to go back again.  A humble setting with wicked food!!
This place was such a good find. Never had been here before and we just searched up a Ramen place to try (since our favorite ramen joint closed down) and I would have to say that Monta Ramen is probably our new favorite. Their menu is small and simple, which I like because then I don't have to sit there forever trying to decide which one I want to order. I was able to see what they have and decide what I wanted quickly. We ordered the Tonkatu Shoyu and added an egg (extra $1.00-$1.50) and it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO yummy! We also ordered their fried rice and gyoza. All was delicious. . . The only downfall I have is that it is such a small restaurant that many people enjoy going to, so if you're there on a busy night.... most likely there will be a wait for a while and you'll be stuck waiting outside. (No inside seating area, hardly). . It was definitely worth the wait for us though. We enjoyed eating here and will be back again for sure.
the inside is very small, so if you have a big group i would think twice about coming during lunch/dinner hours, the ramen I had was really good & the service is really quick.
I had the noodles with chicken broth and the fried rice, the dishes came out quickly and well done despite the dining room being full. The menu is compact the service efficient . I would recommend it to anyone for an informal quick,  well cooked and presented  meal
AMAZING RAMEN? IN VEGAS?. . DID ELVIS KNOW ABOUT THIS!!????. . . We walked out of the Kung Fu Tea boba place next door and already a good line of hungry go-getters. I mean..if you're looking for delicious Asian food in the Chinatown area....get the Ramen.. . So the advantage about being in this line was getting to order first when they opened. Everything good to go! Fresh Fresh!. . It did not disappoint. . . [Food]. Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen. Hit the spot so good.The menu is actually really simple and has 2 main pages. . . [Location]. Ramen house. Bar side and few tables. Slightly tight inside but that's what I like. More authentic. I can see it getting packed in the heavier hours.. . This is like Shinsingumi good. The broth is so rich....and the pork melted in my mouth! The egg noodles were firm and plump. Need to get more extras in your bowl!. . . YOU CAN BE A BALLER AT THE VEGAS BUFFETS BUT THIS RAMEN PLACE IS THE GAME-CHANGER TO GOOD MUST EAT ASIAN FOODS TO EAT IN SIN CITY.
I wouldn't call myself a ramen snob, but I can appreciate a good bowl of ramen when I taste it. And I absolutely did with the Tonkotsu Ramen here- enjoyed it a lot!. . The broth had hearty pork flavor and thick, creamy consistency, noodles were QQ- had the right amount of springy texture and chewiness to it, egg and Chashu Pork cooked perfectly. Everything blended really well together in flavor and texture. Anddd, what you get for the price makes it that much better! Super affordable and delicious always makes for a great meal!. . The fried rice was one of my favorites as well. It's one of those dishes you will end up craving after you leave. Just get it when you go, trust me. I was hesitant when my friend ordered it because it's just fried rice- I could make that at home, right? I ended up eating most of it and left wanting more. . . I've been patiently waiting for Monta to open in Richardson and when it does, I hope it's just as good as it was in Vegas. Can't wait!
I don't have any clue where to eat when a group of 8 is hungry in Vegas, so I opened up yelp. Even though they're not listed on the top, but boyy.. the reviews caught my attention. So here we are at Monta. Ordered Shoyu Ramen, Spicy Tonkotsu ramen, and gyoza.
Not really a big fan of noodle shops but this was the exception. I ordered the chicken and pork which was great. Very tender, melt in your mouth, pork and broth was perfectly seasoned. Small shop, clean, and service was super fast. Defiantly coming back.
Perhaps this is the best ramen that Las Vegas can produce, but it's definitely not the best ramen out there. It's not even "pretty good" ramen. It's simply decent. I came on a weekday for lunch and there were several people waiting outside for a table. This noodle shop is tiny. Luckily, it was only my boyfriend and me so we snatched two seats at the bar. I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen while he had the Tonkotsu Ramen with an egg. . . Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen - pork and chicken broth with two slices of pork chashu, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and a pile of green onions. The broth was extremely salty, especially compared to my boyfriend's broth. The noodles were rather springy but they were still acceptable. Half of the pork chashu was fat so there was actually very little meat.. . Tonkotsu Ramen - pork broth with two slices of pork chashu, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and a pile of green onions. My boyfriend added an egg which was soft-boiled so the white was cooked through, but the yolk remained molten. He thought his ramen was OK (and he's a ramen fanatic!). The broth fell flat (although not as salty as mine).. . The flavors here aren't very compelling. The portions are generous considering a bowl is about $7 and the noodles come out pipin' hot. The restaurant is quite small so I was feeling a bit claustrophobic. That, coupled with the relentless Las Vegas heat, made me want to bolt outta there thesecond I was done slurping my noodles. Service was lackluster, not that I was expecting anything phenomenal. If you're in Chinatown and need a quick and warm bowl of ramen, Monta will suffice.
I just had monta again and had Chizuru as my server again and she was awesome. Very helpful had a smile on her face. Not sure if she recognized me from my previous review but either way I was very pleased. This place is AMAZING.
Wanted to try Monta on my Ramen quest as it was on my list for Las Vegas Ramen places. It was good,, did not disappoint, enjoyed our lunch, but still on my quest for the perfect ramen.
Great Ramen...small menu, but just how I like it. Great service...what else do you need!
We order number one and three. The tonkotsu ramen and shoyutonkotsu ramen. Those are pretty good. I would not recommend the gyoza. Taste like my cooking skill. Gyoza is not crispy and very oily.
Besides gallivanting on the Las Vegas strip for some great eats, my cousin and I decide to venture out. We wanted to get some curry, but the place we wanted to go to was closed during lunch hours. So with my trusty Yelp app, we decided to search what was popular around the vicinity. Monta Ramen was the first thing that popped up in our search, so we headed there.. . As we arrived, there was a small line formed outside the building. Typical for a well known ramen spot. We added our name to the wait list and had about a fifteen minute wait. Once we were called, we sat around the prep area. Our server handed us our menus and gave my cousin some recommendations on their popular dishes. As for myself, I already knew what I was going to get.. . I decided to the the miso based ramen, which includes some basic ingredients:. . - Green onions . - Two slices of chashu. - Bamboo shoots. - Kikurage. . There are extras you can add to your ramen, pricing varies. I got the following extras:  . . - Butter. - Corn. - Extra side of noodles. - Nori. - Soft boiled egg. . Our ramens came out fairly quickly after placing our orders. As quickly as they were served, they remained piping hot! The presentation was nicely put together. I mixed all the ingredients in the bowl and took my first sip of the broth. The broth was very tasty. The addition of the butter gave the broth a creamy taste. The noodles were soft and easy to chew. The hard boiled egg was perfectly cooked to my liking with the runny yolk. The chashu seemed a little dry, but still tasted great.. . Overall, a great experience and comparable to some of my favorite ramen spots in the Bay Area.
Went here with my dad and cousin. We waited 30 minutes outside. I thought to myself, "heck yeah, this wait is going to be worth it because I've heard a lot of good things about this place!" Tried the food. Wasn't impressed. I ordered a Shoyu Ramen and a mini mentaiko bowl. I expected the mentaiko bowl to be delicious, and it was--but trust me, after a few bites that sodium content will turn you off. A few minutes later, the shoyu ramen came. Too salty for my tastes. . My cousin ordered a Tonkotsu ramen and I tried it. I wish I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen instead because it wasn't AS salty, but still pretty salty. My dad ordered a miso ramen. Again, it was salty..  You get the gist.. . Aside from the salty dishes, we ordered gyoza and fried rice. The fried rice was pretty standard and the gyoza was just a bit better from the frozen ones you can get at the store. Neato.. Maybe I'll come back when I'm low on sodium intake. . . The only good thing was the service. I wouldn't recommend this for big groups because the place is pretty small and it's usually packed whenever I'm around the area.
This location is very small and sometimes too crowded, but it hits the spot every time. If you're looking for a quick pick me up meal, Monta is the place to go. Their menu is small but very straightforward. It's sometimes nice to not be overwhelmed by a huge variety of things on a menu. They have different ramen bases and sides that you can add to your ramen. The ramen is very delicious and filled with lots of flavor. If you aren't craving ramen, they also have delicious rice dishes and other nonsoup based dishes. This place also does not break the bank. Cheap eats that are actually very yummy is always the way to go. As for the service, I feel like it depends on the day. If it isn't too busy, it's very fast, and obviously if it is busy, you may have to wait a bit longer. This place is definitely a casual dining environment, with yummy Japanese comfort food! Overall this hole in the wall joint is worth it, especially for a college student on a budget such as myself. Monta definitely has me coming back for more.
My black ramen was awesome. Fried garlic created aroma that delivers energy.. The soup might be a little bit to salty to finish, but overall it's good.
Yum yum yum, I love ramen, so of course I had to have it in Vegas!. . Wait was not bad at all , 5 minutes, but we came in on a Monday night before my flight out, so that may have been why. I ordered the Kuro ramen (black garlic oil ramen) and it was possibly the best Kuro ramen I have had thus far. There is a restaurant that specializes in kuro ramen near my own home, but it does not compare to Monta's. . . The food came out pretty fast, which is always awesome. The garlic was incredibly flavorful and aromatic and just amazingly delicious. Chashu was also really nice and tender. My only qualm was that the broth was a little salty for my own liking. I had to add some ginger and sesame seeds to cut the saltiness a bit, but other than that it was very, very good. If I had access to Mona Ramen close to my own home, I would eat there so much it would definitely not be too good for my blood pressure.. . Can't wait to come back and try their tonkatsu and miso ramen as well!
