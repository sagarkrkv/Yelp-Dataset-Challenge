The only reason why I'm even giving this place a star is because of the DJs and the ambiance. Hakkasan always book top-notch acts and they have great decor.. . I've been here three times to see R3hab, Above & Beyond, and Tiesto. R3hab was the only positive experience I had. The two other times, I felt very mistreated. The people who work here and the men they lure into this club are misogynistic and rude. For Tiesto, I was with 10 girls and we were in the VIP section. My boyfriend and I were doing our separate things that night but he came over to me in the VIP section to come say hello. They didn't allow him in the section, which makes sense since he didn't pay to be in VIP. But what really made me upset was when the bouncer who was monitoring the VIP section realized that he was my boyfriend, he came over to me and told me that I needed to leave the section. I asked him why and he told me that since I had a boyfriend, I was pretty much useless in selling the table since I wouldn't be "flirting" with any of the guys who end up buying the table. In his exact words: "You would bring the value of the table down." Just because I wasn't single, I was bringing the value of the table down.. . The last time was this weekend with Above & Beyond. My friends and I didn't come with a promoter and were glad we didn't because the line was 2 hours long for the guest list. We get in and even though we actually paid for our tickets, a person that works there ushered us to sit at a table with some guys. We didn't want to, but my friends feet hurt so bad that we ended up deciding to sit (mind you, you can't sit down anywhere unless you buy a table or decide to entertain guys who bought a table). We sit, the server pours us drinks, and we were hoping at least these guys would be nice. Nope, one of the guys immediately took the drink the server gave me out of my hand and told me that if I'm going to drink, I'm going to have to entertain him. I stood up and left because I wasn't going to prostitute myself in order to sit down. I was pretty upset and what made it even worse was that the person that worked there who ushered us to the table told us that we were rude for leaving their table within 5 minutes. . . If you are a woman, be prepared to enter into a prostitution ring when you enter Hakkasan because that's essentially what it is.
Hakkasan is fortunate that they were able to secure Tiesto and Calvin Harris as its resident DJs.  Other than that, there's nothing really special about the club.  I'd describe it as the little bigger Light.  . . Plus, the bouncers here are extremely rule.  I mean I understand that all bouncers in Vegas have to put up a front.  It's part of the job, but Hakksan seems to escalate that notion to a higher level.  In one instance, I saw a person, who was in the General Admissions line, asking a legitimate question to a bouncer about how to purchase pre-sale tickets.  Granted, while a legitimate question, I agree that the question wasn't probably the smartest question to ask, particularly with the existence of the internet.  However,  I thought the bouncer could have been a little more helpful by at least acknowledging the person asking the question instead of just flat out ridiculing her for being in the GA line.
Every girl's nightmare: Flights of stairs to climb in our heels and a ten square foot dance floor inviting creeps to grab your ass (and get away with it). . . Great DJs but unfortunately you won't be able to enjoy them here. I'm returning to XS where the DJs are also good and there's space to actually breathe.
Great club. Follow Luis on instagram!! Staff was amazing from bathroom attendants to bus boy's.!! EVERYONE!!
Left my jacket at a table, walked personally back by Casey after closing. Outstanding.
Can you say gong show?. . Our husbands/bfs/friends had a table but it took what seemed like forever to get in.  They were inside and it was 1:30am or so.  No line, just a mass of people hovering behind the velvet ropes trying to get the attention of the dude with the clipboard.  . . A lot of complaints about stairs?  We took the elevator.  No problem.  . . I understand it's a thing here, but people asking for Steve Aoki to "cake me" was...  quite the sight.  How do you continue clubbing afterwards, smothered in cream?  I guess I'm just old.  I don't see the appeal.  . . The raft was pretty cool though, crowd surfing in a raft!  Yeah!. . We had a table on the balcony and it was a great view of all the excitement going on down below.  We didn't get crushed by the other club-goers.  . . I do have to say though, randoms would walk in and stand next to us even though it was right next to our table.  This space should've been shared with only the bottle service patrons.  A premium was paid for great service by our attractive server, but there wasn't enough security to keep the strangers on the other side.. . All in all, a most memorable night!  If you like EDM, are willing to drop lots of cash, check this place out!
Stay away from this place.  We got bottle service for a friend's bachelor party and they switched the table we booked for an inferior one and we had to pay an extra $1k. They were acting extremely dishonest the wheel time. Avoid this host Kevin and his underling Josh. . . The night afterwards was OK but I have had much better experiences at marquee and XS. Will not be coming back period.
First off, let's make getting in pretty simple; guys should buy presale tickets (unless you're getting bottle service), and girls can get in free with their names on a guestlist. Just find a promoter. So the problem Hakkasan has is that there should be 2 different guestlist lines: one for general guestlist and another for girls only! It's pretty self-explanatory; the guys are there to meet some ladies (right!?), and if all the girls are in line for an hour, how are they supposed to meet them???. . If you want to make it to the dance floor, Hakkasan sure makes your work for it. There are stairs on top of stairs to get to the dance floor. Once you do get there, there's a good chance you're going to feel like you're part of a herding cattle on a farm. It gets super crowded!. . Despite all the negatives, Hakkasan has no problem getting all the biggest DJs from all over the world to perform.
Hakka-stairs! So many stairs all over the place, totally unnecessary hassle for drunkards. This place is always just whatever. Lines start to build up at around 9-930, yet they don't even open the doors until 1030-1100. So be prepared to stand in the same spot for a long time before getting in. If there is a headliner DJ playing, then any music you hear before 2am is going to be complete garbage. I bought one drink for $23 on a non-holiday Saturday night. Saw many people in here with jeans and tshirt. There are so many other clubs that are more upscale, have better music and layout and more reasonable for drinks. All around, not so great.
Went here to watch Calvin Harris labor day weekend, and I was very impressed. Vegas nightlife is over the top, but this was even more insane than I could have imagined. This place was packed though and the drinks were very expensive (even a bottle of water was $8), so pregame or be prepared to pay for your visit. I did not rate this place very highly mainly because of their process of letting people into the club. It is very unorganized and we waited in multiple lines for a couple of hours before we got into the club. Also, we were told that we would not have to pay cover since we were in line before midnight, but this was not the case. When we got to the front, they told us that we still had to pay the cover, so there was a lot of miscommunication between the staff and management. We managed to get the price cut in half (to $33), but I was still upset that they were not clear in their rules. The experience once we got in was great and Calvin Harris was a really great DJ. I would go back to this place to catch another famous act, but I will definitely wear flats next time and be mentally prepared to wait.
I didn't come here for a while because I thought it was just a re-branded Studio 54 and that place was hot garbage. In town for a birthday party, I got guilted into going and had an F-in ball! this place is awesome, my favorite nightclub in Las Vegas right now. Music is great on both floors a little something for everyone. It was stupid expensive, like $10 for a beer and $70 for 4 shots of Fireball, but that's expected at any Vegas nightclub. It loses a star for set-up. The top floor is used for the headliner (usually Tiesto/Calvin Harris) and every space is good. Its WAAAAY crowded, but the folks in here didnt seem to care they were in a trance like Jesus was speaking. the 2nd floor was hip hop and the set up was wack. If you don't have a table, you are, in effect, left on the outside of the party looking in. Still, great music, everyone i ran into was friendly and not on the usual instagram model BS. Word of advice, pay the money and get a table it will improve your experience 10 fold. . PS. i heard they were charging $75 a head (crazy) that night and being stingy letting people in on supposed guest lists.
If you're a fan of EDM, this is the place to be-- best resident DJ's and guest DJ's. The only pitfall is unless you are on a table, you will be stuck fist pumpin' with others so close together it's like you're in a sardine can. The hip hop floor is lots of fun too, but the same applies regarding it being in your best interest to have a reserved spot if you want to thoroughly enjoy your time there! I've been 3 times (Tiesto, Nervo, & Martin Garrix) and not 1 time has let me down!
Ok first off, if they don't have big DJs like Tiesto, Aoki, and Calvin Harris, I will not step into that place!! Staffs will treat you like shits! Only if you have money to spend big at once and then they will kiss your ass! Guest list you will have to stand in front of their club for two hours and then when you are about to step in, they will tell you that you have to pay for cover. And it's not even a reasonable price either. And you stood there to helped promote their club for free and you didn't even get in! If they cut off the guest list line they should at least tell you right at the time they cut off, but they let you stand there for two hours to make them look busy. It's selfish and greedy cause the times you are wasting there you could have time to think about where you can go or find out another option for them. And staffs will ignore you completely if you act like you don't wanna pay for cover. I saw some people who were so excited about their night got turned down just like that. I meant tourists want to make their memorable nights but not all of them can afford to spend 5k or more in one night for only two people or couples. But maybe they can spend $500+ from buying small drinks at the bar for their friends or ladies. They are all assholes seriously! Me and my friends then left to XS who actually welcomed us better and the staffs at XS always have the best service! We can just use the cover fee money that we supposed to pay at Hakkasan buying drinks at XS and we even spend more than that. We had a great time so good that we decided to open bottle service that very night. We are not cheap but to discriminate people like that plus treating people like that, I need to spread the news to knowledge people how they will be treated and what to expect if they want to visit this place. You can go try this out yourself, and you will understand why I am so upset over this. If Hakkasan's staff still stuck up and held their nose up high then I wish their business will go just as the way they treat their customers. Peace! Luv XS and Marquee!! Always make my night!!
The DJ lineup is THE reason to come to this newcomer to the list of high-end Las Vegas night life venues! Many of the top EDM headliners have residency here including Calvin Harris, Tiesto, and Hardwell. Even the house DJs that play before the main show, which starts around 1:30am, are pretty good!. . As such, the venue can easily get overwhelmingly crowded. And, with all the people, you'll need to be extra careful not to fall over all the steps and stairs. . . Bottle service is top dollar. Tables 21 and 61 are the best seats in the house. But any booth in the Main Room has a great view of the show. Booths on the Mezzanine floor are farther away but still have a great view.
At long last, I finally had my chance to visit the supposed king of Vegas megaclubs, the often-touted (and also doubted) Hakkasan.... . Was it as epic as Instagram makes it out to be? Somewhat. . Were there areas where the club could work on improving itself? Absolutely. . . I had tickets to see Hardwell during HK's grand opening back in April 2013 (which coincided with my 21st birthday), but I never had the chance to make my way to Vegas - I ended up spending the weekend at Coachella instead. (No complaints from me, that's for sure.). . A lot of people seem to complain about Hakkasan's notoriously long lines. I have no problem with buying presale tickets for a nightclub - especially one that's marketed to a high-end clientele. If you're looking to have a killer night for a reasonable price, it really boils down to being able to pick the right weekend to visit. My girlfriend and I scored tickets to see Bingo Players at HK for an absolute steal ($30 forme, 20 for her), and we didn't have to go through the stress of drunkenly waiting in the general admission line. I can't stress enough how useful it is to scope out the Events Calendar on the HK website ahead of time - you'll save yourself plenty of waiting/money by going with presale  - just keep an eye out for the right deals!. . But I digress. Let's talk about the club itself.. . I expected HK to look a more extravagant; the place gives off a sort of Asian cavern-themed aesthetic. There's no outdoor section of the club to venture to if you're in search of some fresh air (unlike the open pool deck provided at Marquee even during nightclub hours), so be prepared to encounter some mild claustrophobia as you're making your way through Hakkasan's dimly-hit hallways.. . The production setup at Hakkasan - like the club's overall design - was memorable, but not game-changing. During our visit, I took particular notice of the visuals that accompanied Eva Shaw and Bingo Players during their respective sets. These visuals have a remarkably high resolution and clarity, and they're quite mesmerizing (and I've been to my fair share of shows, mind you). . . As advertised, you shouldn't encounter much difficulty getting an ideal view of the main room DJ - regardless of whether you have a table or not. Unlike those at Marquee (where bouncers constantly redirect patrons around the room to keep multiple walkways clear), Hakkasan's bouncers are pretty cool about letting clubgoers scope the scene out from the perimeter of the dancefloor. I also appreciate how there's little-to-no waiting for anyone who's looking to make their way onto the actual dance space. . . What ultimately sinks the ship for me is the hit-or-miss quality of the staff at Hakkasan. On one hand, you've got the bouncers: . . Although it seems like everyone and their mother seems to despise these guys, I found them to be pleasant and cheery dudes. The bouncers who checked our IDs at the door even gave the lady and I some resounding congratulations after we mentioned that we were celebrating our six months together! Similarly, other bouncers who worked inside the club itself were happy to tell me where they purchased their suits from (I'm that guy that goes to a club and eyes other dudes' suit fits, I'll admit.). . My biggest gripe of my entire evening at Hakkasan however, was the total ineptitude of the bartending staff. Let me set the scene for you:. . We approached a bar located in the HK main room. Just getting a bartender's attention was a challenge in itself; the guy serving our segment of the bar repeatedly glanced over and around us, as though we weren't there! Understaffed or not, a "be right with you!" would have gone a long way. Hell, even eye contact would have been an improvement over being ignored like a pair of ghosts.... . In any case, after finally managing to get a bartender's attention, we asked for a Hakka to split. (For those who may not know, the Hakka is one of HK's signature cocktails, made with Belvedere, coconut, passionfruit, and lychee.) We hadn't been told, however, that Hakkasan Restaurant and Hakkasan Nightclub didn't share the same drink menu. Honest mistake, right?. . Well, instead of providing this simple explanation, our bartender informed us that he "didn't have all the ingredients" and that we would have to go "downstairs to the Ling-Ling bar" in order to order a Hakka. So off we went, through a shoulder-to-shoulder crowd, to the floor below - and after a similar long wait with this bartender's counterpart, we're told that Hakkasan Nightclub doesn't offer the Hakka. At all. . . Again, it wasn't so much their inability to provide the drink that upset me so much as it was the obvious lack of adequate training and overall employee knowledge. Suffice to say, my girlfriend and I promptly had to order a pair of AMFs just to drown out our anger for the time being.. . Premium product and eye candy marred by some sloppy execution. The very definition of 3/5 stars.
Let's cut to the chase: the only way you'll enjoy this experience is if you spend thousands of dollars and go for the VIP package. If you want to just come here for the famous DJ or for a quick night out, go elsewhere. I'm not sure if it's because my expectations were high but the setup of this club makes it almost impossible to have a good time. There's a huge flight of stairs to get to the tiny dance floor that's completely jam-packed. Where do you stand to enjoy the drink you just got at the bar? Good luck finding a spot. . They do, however, have a lovely setup of dancers throughout the club doing aerobics on pedestals. That was my favorite part but I was gone approx. 20 mins after entering. Unbearable.
3 rooms with great music.  The lighting and sound has to be the best I've heard and seen hands down. Drinks are stiff and not as expensive as other clubs on the strip.  You never know what celeb your going to be rubbing elbows with here.
3.5 stars. . The venue is big for Vegas club and always has great DJs spinning. Drink prices are just as bad as NY prices (maybe worse for Patron shots).
Security here are straight up douche bags... Rude and didn't let us in because my girl friend's id was a little old. Gf died her hair and looks a little different in id so they didn't let us in. Turned us to the cops, they believed us but douche bag manager said "give her card back but no club". Fucking asshole. If you come here make sure your id is up to date and looks exactly like you. Was so excited to see tiesto but shit happens....
Don't wasted your time here,  we got bottles services and was waiting 2hrs in their reservation line.  Finally left and went to Taos
Saw Tiesto here last night and had an awesome time!. . Hakkasan is a little bit larger than the average Vegas nightclub, and the ambience is on par with the rest. The lighting and overall design was all excellent. There are multiple bars and multiple floors. The DJ lineup never disappoints!! Tiesto began his set around 1:30am after the opening DJ got the place going wild!. . I'm definitely coming back to Hakkasan during my next Vegas trip.
This place is awesome! The music was great, the servers were on point, and security had class. Specifically giving a shout o one guard, Dee. On point.
I was very pleased with my visit here at hakkasan. Despite the rude annoying drunk people in the line, I thought the bouncers and promoters were outstanding and respectful. Unlike some of these other clubs on the strip who seem to power trip over there status of holding the clipboard. I appreciate hakkasan for being organized aswell. Nice club though and I enjoyed coming here. I'll be partying here again thanks to the promoters. Kudos!
My night here included a group of 8 girlfriends on I heart radio weekend and Calvin Harris spinning. We got bottle service in the hip hop room. First off, the venue is beautiful and really big. The service at our table was great-- really friendly and on top of it. With that said, tables started at $3k!! Even with the venue being cool... It's not $3k cool! Instead, we got in for no cover and kept in touch with a promoter. After about a hour, we were able to get a table for $1500. Still a crazy high price but it is what it is on a busy weekend. Despite the things the club has going for it (good service and nice venue) I couldn't fully enjoy it with the lame music and insane amounts of people. The hip hop room had no variety in the hip hop being played. It just got boring after a while. The crowd was insane. Literally had to push through bodies to get anywhere. I'm sure this place is nice when it's not as packed... But not the night that I was there.
I honestly have been waiting to write this review for a long time and I make sure to tell anyone I know NOT to go to this club. And it's not because the drinks are expensive or something small like that. It's because I honestly had one of the worst experiences with a club EVER there and it nearly drove me to tears. Here's why:. . So a group of friends and I met in Vegas to celebrate my best friend's 21st birthday. Before we got to Vegas I bought three tickets to Hakkasan which cost me close to $200. Then once we were in Vegas, I found a promoter to get the rest of the group in for free. But here's the catch: the promoter said we had to be there by 10:00 pm to get in for free, so that's what we did. Once we got inside we found out that unless you're ordering bottle service or a VIP, there isn't a single place to sit and just drink. And we found out Calvin Harris wasn't coming on till 1 am. So we asked SEVERAL of the people working inside that if we left, could we get back inside? They said there would be a re-entry line but that we would get back in eventually.. . When my friends and I returned a few hours later, the people REFUSED to let us back in claiming they "don't do that at Hakkasan." After I told them that several people inside had told me it was okay and showed them the very expensive tickets I purchased, they said it was irrelevant and that we should move along. What made me even more pissed off was that as soon as we walked away, I saw the same bouncers let a group of girls back in that had left earlier.. . I have NEVER received such poor customer service from an establishment and hope to never step foot near Hakkasan again. So I guess my advice is, if you're ready to spend hundreds of dollars on a table and bottle service, I'm sure this club is decent. But if you're an average person, stay far, far away!
Hakkasan!  I was fortunate enough to go to this night club for a huge work event.  And all I can say is if you love to to dance and have a great time then you need to try Hakkasan!  What a BLAST!   My ears are still ringing!  TheDJ and staff are awesome!
Bartenders, sound and security get a 10 out of 10.  One star for the amount of people allowed in here.  I ran clubs in Chicago for ten years.  This place tonight is over filled by at least 1500 people.  Mgm is either paying off the fire dept or just covering the fines.  Such a shame for an amazing club. Only a matter of time before a serious accident happens here.
Don't bother with guestlist if you're trying to see a big headliner, just buy presale so you don't wait for hours just to get in!. . It's great that there's always a good headliner DJ playing every weekend in Vegas, thanks to their resident lineup, but the biggest problems here are the layout and the management.. . The layout is like an up-and-down maze. The steps are always overcrowded with people, so watch your step or you'll be playing dominoes in human form. If you want to avoid the crowded dancefloor (and getting stepped on by high heels nonstop), it's good to escape upstairs, but there really isn't an area to dance. You do get a good view of the fancy lights and effects.. . The management is pretty bad. In my past experiences dealing with the promoters here, they are pretty rude or just inadequate in helping you get into the venue without some catch.
