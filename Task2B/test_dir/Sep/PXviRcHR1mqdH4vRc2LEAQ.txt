Venue:  Bachi Burger. . Decor: Cafe style....not a lot of lighting, bar area. . Service: Seemed well from what I saw. . Environment: Busy, Busy, Busy...very popular. . Food: A little of variety but mainly Asian style Burgers.  . Prices:  You pay for what you get.  . Debbie Downers:  Long wait if you go during busy hours but that's the downer of good food.  . Conclusion: I had the black & blue burger.  That was absolutely delicious.  Very fresh.  Grass fed.  Flavorful.  The bun was tremendous.  Received a lot of recommendations from different people to try this place out.  Made my way there.  Called ahead of time and boy I was not disappointed.  Also the appetizer with the Chili Fried Chicken is something off the chain.  That sauce was amazing on that sucka........Next time I go there, i will have to try this oxtail chili cheese fries.  If you reside in the Vegas area and have not tried this place out, you really are doing yourself a disservice!  If it was located in my city (ATL),  it would be top 5....easily!.  . Overall: B+ / A-
Like many people, I saw this place on Triple D and while I was in Vegas decided to check it out. It delivered. I had my hopes low because some of the spots of DDD that I've been to have not been great, while others have. I had the Shogun burger, which had foie gras and poached pear. For $27, that burger better have been great and it was. Vastly different flavor profile than any burger you've probably ever had. The flavor is so potent too that the flavor was still in my mouth even after I ate breakfast the next morning. Sweet potato fries and garlic fries were definitely great. I don't normally like fries but if they are dressed well and come with really good dipping sauces then I like them. That was the case here. Service was also on point. It reminded me of spots in NYC because the crowd and waiters are kind of hipster, which was cool with me. Definitely different than the strip. It looks like a place that was created and run by young people, but people who still know how to handle a business. I would recommend this place and be back when I'm in Vegas probably for the Shogun burger but I might try something else.
Well... this didn't start off on quite the right foot. We arrived at 10p on a Saturday night. Upon walking in, we noticed that there was plenty of seating around, so we didn't expect to wait- and we didn't. However, the host sat us at the first table, right by the door, crammed against the wall with a view of the host stand. Um.... So, we asked if we could be moved. We were, to the back of the restaurant. Only slightly better. This wasn't going well... The whole seating situation there is a bit of a CF, though, all of the "booth" dining is WAY too close together, which we found out when a group of rather large individuals were crammed right next to us (and as a reminder, there were plenty of tables available).. . Okay... lets move past that. The service overall was fine enough, although we ended up having two servers because one took his break while we were dining. . . The food.... Not bad. The truffle parmesean fries were delicious! I ordered the "Kiki's" burger and was overall pleased with it, it had a lot of flavor, was juicy, and I loved the bread, but the sweet onion marmalade overwhelmed the burger. I could barely taste the mushrooms, and couldn't taste the egg or cheese at all.. . So, all in all, it was pretty close to a 2 star review, but I'm feeling a bit generous. I don't think it is worth a revisit, though.
OMG!!! When is the LA/Sawtelle location going to open!?!?!?!?! I can't just conveniently drive to Las Vegas whenever I'm craving The Miyagi every week. . You guys are my top 3 for burgers. . . For Asian foodies or foodies that like Asian food and/or burgers, then Bachi is a must try!! The hype doesn't die down here. Everything is good, every burger is a different flavor profile, and you can even create your own burger!. . The Miyagi is my favorite. I love fried egg anything, furikake has amazing sweet & salty flavors, and the crunchy texture from the onion rings makes it a winner every single time! Plus the wagyu beef patty. ooooooooooomahgaaaaaaaawd!!!! drooling & FEIGNING FOR IT RIGHT NOW! Paired with truffle fries, or ox tail fries, or plain fries...perfectly crispy every time. I'm hungry.
Had the shogun which is the most expensive burger but it was well worth it. Actually cheaper to have this stuff in a burger than by itself. . . Seared foie gras. Unagi. Waghu beef. Asian pear. . It's a rich taste with every bite. See you next month and everytime we come to vegas.
Poor customer service... Parking at this location is atrocious.  Please be aware that this place is horrible for groups. I'm done with Bachi burger and the  poor customer service and food
Saw them on Food Networks Diners, Drive-ins & Dives.  There was a bit of a wait which can be considered a good sign.   The food did not disappoint!  Very good flavor on everything we ordered.    Will come back when I return to Vegas.   .  I would have rated 5 Stars if the hostess was friendly.  She didnt smile at all and didnt offer a menu to look at while we waited for our table.
Fantastic burgers made with many ingredients you don't usually find in a burger. I got the Shogun burger made with Wagyu beef, unagi, and foie gras. It was fabulous-best burger I've ever had. It was pricey at $26, but the ingredients were one of a kind.Pair this with the oxtail chili cheese fries and you are set! Foodies should give this place a try. It isn't near the strip, but definitely worth the drive. I went on the way to the airport.
This is my favorite burger restaurant. I live in LA but every time I go to Vegas (which is quite often) I have to grab a burger here before coming home. My favorite is the Miyagi-San but I can't say I've had an underwhelming burger here. All the flavors with each burger work well together. I can't wait for the LA location to open so I don't have to drive 300 miles to get a good burger ;)
So good!! Me and a group of friends ordered the truffle fries (had gravy on top), ramen bowls and burgers. . . I ordered the tonkatsu ramen ($10) and the broth was so tastey I didn't even want to add any seasoning. The ramen was really soft and fresh. Loved that the yolk in the egg was still oozing showed the freshness of the egg as well. Two pieces of pork in the soul and it was good but it was all fat.. . Also ordered a burger ($15) (forgot the name) but it had onion rings and a sunny side egg in it an it was delicious! The patty is so soft and full of flavor.. . The waitress forgot our oxtail fries but that's okay because we were stuffed. . . Giant burgers can definitely share between two people with an appetizer. They don't skimp on the ramen bowl either!. . Good portion, good price, tastey food!
First time visiting this place and I am greatly impressed. The servers were very nice and prompt, the wait wasn't too bad but it would be great if they could fit in more chairs or put benches outside.. Now the food. Every single thing we tried was delicious. We started with the chili chicken appetizer and it was crispy and sweet while the chicken remained so juicy. Combined with the sauce that accompanies it, it tastes almost like eating hot wings. I ordered the Miyagi-San burger which was insanely good. The fresh buns are the softest I have ever held and my burger was cooked just how I wanted it. The fries are crispy and addictive and all the dipping sauces pack a flavor punch. Lastly, order a cocktail because they are all so delicious and make the experience.
One of the BEST burger joints I've been to! Shoutout to Guy Fieri and Triple D for the recommendation! Service was really good and our waiter was really helpful. I already knew what to order coming to this restaurant after seeing their episode on the Food Network, but our waiter told us his recommendations. Ordered the bahn mi burger, truffle fries, and red velvet milkshake. . . It didn't take that long for the food to come. out and once it did everything looked absolutely delicious. The presentation of each dish was on point and very creative. The burger was super good! It had the whole bahn mi aspect to it with the flavors/ingredients and the burger was really juicy.  The truffle fries were piping hot, crispy, and the truffle sauce took the fries to another level. Lastly, the red velvet milkshake was the BOMB and it was literally a red velvet cake in a milkshake form.. . I highly recommend this place whenever you're in Vegas and a heads up, they have two locations out there. They're opening one in the West Los Angeles area and I certainly can't wait for that!
I've gone here many times and every time I go here my experience is always great. When it comes down to being greeted, seated, and ever served. I always have a pleasant time. . . The environment vibe is classy and also modern. When it comes to the food they have a great presentation when served and plus it's delicious. I ordered a medium rare Ronin Burger and it was made just right.. . I would recommend this Restuarant if you want a well, unique and one of a kind type of burger here in Las Vegas.
I guess since I'm the Duke of Bachi Burger (as of 9/11/2014) I should relinquish my duties as Duke, whatever those might be, to finally write a review of this place.   It took 60+ visits for me to come on here and officially proclaim: Bachi Burger is the best burger joint in town.. . I read all of the 3 star and below reviews and I feel sad for those reviewers.  Not because they don't have good taste, but because they clearly haven't experienced the Bachi that I've come to know and love over the years since it opened.  I will say that even though I am blessing it with 5 stars, I've definitely had moments where I questioned that rating, be it from visits where I experienced awful service, undercooked burgers, or the terrible, terrible practice of their writing down my credit card info every time I make a take-out order.  All of those are forgiven though for me due to the 85% of the time when everything is flawless.. . I've had almost everything on the menu.  My absolute favorite order is the Black and Green burger.  When they nail it, they absolutely nail it.   The Wagyu beef, bacon, blue cheese, spinach and mushrooms all form together like Voltron to make one of the best burgers I've ever had.  But there are 70 other reviews where you can read about that.   I also really like the Lonely Bird when I'm not feeling like red meat, which isn't too often.   Miyagi San, Banh-Mi, Ronin, all solid as well and belong in my rotation.   . . One thing I rarely see mentioned or see people take advantage of is the build your own burger feature.  I've actually had several times just a straight up Bachi Burger with a Wagyu patty which comes standard with Lettuce, Tomato and Onion and anything else you want, but it doesn't even need anything else.  It's nice to know that they're not just putting lipstick on a pig, or in this case, a cow, and that the meat can stand on its own.  . . I hinted earlier at undercooked burgers and I will say that in my experience Bachi tends to cook on the lower end of the spectrum.   Medium-Rare which is how I would normally like it has come out too rare for me and Medium often comes out the way I'd normally expect Medium-Rare.   So I stick with medium for the most part. . . For fries they do a decent sweet potato fry, and oddly enough I just don't get the hype over the oxtail chili cheese fries even though I've had them 5-6 times, once done over sweet potato fries which I think is a special order type thing.   Fries, oxtail meat, and egg sounds like my death row last meal, but each time I found them underwhelming and prefer to just go the Salt and Pepper Garlic french fry route.   The fries aren't at all what keeps me coming back here and I'd like to see them experiment more with different varieties, but it seems to be the same ones from the first day I went there and I'm guessing that won't change anytime soon.. . Drink-wise they do a mean sake sangria which I find irresistible, although pricey and they have Rogue Hazelnut ale, so I'm normally happy either way.   . . Service can be inconsistent, usually due to how it's ALWAYS BUSY, but there are several very solid individuals who work there at the moment and they treat the Duke with respect, as they should.
I cannot believe I didn't write a review of this place! My husband and I brought our son here with us on our Spring Break trip this year. I had read that they had a foie gras burger and since we are Californians and denied the joy of foie anymore, we had to come. . Our picky eater son had the fries which he loved. My husband and I started with the chili fries with the oxtail. OMG. Like OMG. We both had the Shogun Burger. It was like angels sang and wept. THE BEST! The manager came by later and we told her how much we loved the burger. She said a lot of Californians come in and are enraptured by it. . It's a hipster kinda place with Japanese influence but don't let that scare you off.
Bachi Burger has not disappointed other then the fact that we were seated a really hot room, I guess the air conditioner was not working in their newly added room. The service was great and everything we ordered was great. My girlfriends and I split 4 burgers in 4's so that we could each try a different burger. We shared 2 orders of Ox tail chili cheese fries and onion rings and everything was so good. . . If you are traveling from LA to Vegas I would make it a point to stop by Bachi Burger to eat here, it gets pricey when you taxi it over from the strip so its a must stop before arriving or before departing Vegas.
Unique.  It is definitely worth a try.  Started with the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Can you say yummy? Next we tried the Bachi Pickles.  These pickled, mostly Asian vegetables, were great.  For the main course I had the Black & Green Burger (American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, Sauteed Mushrooms, Spinach, Bacon,Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Roasted Garlic) with avocado.  The burger melted in mouth.  We, also, ordered the bacon fried rice from Shoku Ramen menu.  It was just ok, but glad I tried it.  Shoku Ramen is the sister restaurant of Bachi.  You can order from either menu.
Alright place. Had the tonkotsu ramen and the ronin burger. Both were alright. Ramen broth was good at first but kind of too sweet. Burger was too marinated.
I've been here a few times now and Bachi has not yet disappointed.  If you wanna come for a premium burger that tastes even more awesome on an egg bun, do come and check out Bachi and try it out.  For me, it's been the Miyagi Wagyu burger for the win each time...but the last time we were there, one of the servers told us that the burger that all the staff has and swears by is the miso wagyu burger...he said to definitely try it the next time we come out there.. . And as an added bonus, they joined up with the ramen joint a few months ago and now serve both on their menus.  I come here for the burgers, but you know me and my love relationship with ramen; so of course I tried it out too...just the tonkatsu though.  The broth wasn't as tasty as I had expected, but the chasu was prob one of the best I've had...nice and fatty and super tender.  If you can split it amongst your group, I'd definitely go for it.. . The fries: sweet potato, truffle, oxtail, and regular, are all awesome, and DEFINITELY can feed more than one person, as we learned to our doom the first time we came in and each ordered fries.  The oxtail is quite heavy so you might wanna split the burger...but then again, this is vegas, INDULGE!!!!. . This place can get absolutely packed, which is a sign of the good food, the popularity of the burger, and just the fact that Bachi rules!  So I would come at non-peak times, which is hard to determine for Vegas, Thursday night at around 10 the wait was 40 minutes, Saturday around 9:30 the wait was 5...so it really does follow along with the vegas theme of just gettin lucky.  . . PS - there's a new bigger spot also about 15 min away from the strip...but with traffic, can actually take much longer to get to, but if this place is too busy, at least you have a second option.  . . Staff - Great!  Esp with the recommendations and the good humor.  Thanks Bachi! :)
This place is delis! The wait was a tad long but worth it! I looooove their Banh Mi burger!. . Service was great too!. . The server mentioned they're opening up two locations in SoCal...I can't wait!!
Burger is awesome. Not the healthiest but greasy and juicy jist the way your mouth likes it. They also carry hitachino beer in tap. How awesome is that? Minus star for the wait. Waiting sucks.
Bachi burger never disappoint me. Ever! I love this place and I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends. I love how they collaborate with "shoku" (I believe that's the word, not sure) anyway, love their soup.
I'm an avid viewer of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and I've always wanted to go to the places that Guy goes to but most of the time they are on the other side of the states. When I saw that he went to a burger joint in Vegas that was Asian fusion? I quickly bookmarked it and was already anticipating my next Vegas trip. I've been here twice since and I'd have to say that this is one of my favorite burger joints.. . Not located anywhere near The Strip, but relatively close by in the neighboring city of Henderson The restaurant is tucked away in a plaza but easy to find and plenty of parking. Make sure you call in advance to see how long the wait is! I usually call and the wait time for me around dinner time is around 15 mins or so for a party of 8. The wait area is small with a few chairs. The restaurant is cute, simple, and modern. The service is quick and fast and the workers are friendly.. . Since I've been here twice, I've gotten the opportunity to try many different things, especially since I shared with one of my friends!. . --Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: Holy Oxtail! My favorite appetizer here for sure. When you pop the yolk on the fried egg and let it drip down onto the fries, it's literally food porn. The fries are nicely fried, the oxtail is sweet yet tender, and the chili is delicious. A very savory yet sweet appetizer and I love! 5/5. . --Pork Belly Steamed Buns: Took a couple bites of this and I like it! Probably my second favorite appetizer. The pork belly was fatty and savory and together with the steamed bun, boiled egg, and the hoisin saucemade it extra yummy. 4/5. . --Hot Crab n' Creamy Cauliflower Dip: Ordered this on a whim with my friend to share and I did not like it at all. It sounded good with the artichoke and cauliflower, but the flavors were so odd. The crab was extra fishy and the lap chong did not compliment the fishiness at all. It was horrible but it wasn't delicious either. I stayed away from this. 2/5. . --Kikis Burger: This was the first burger I tried and the variety of mushrooms in this burger is what sold me. The burger was so juicy and delicious. The garlic chili aioli was a nice finishing touch to the burger as well. If you're having a hard time choosing a burger, I'd say this is a simple yet delicious burger to try. 4/5. . --Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger: I had this burger this past weekend and anything with a fried egg is already a plus in my book. After one bite, my eyes literally rolled back. It was so darn good! The fried onions, the bacon, the egg... and best of all you can really taste the quality in this burger. It was juicy and flavorful. 5/5. . To many, many more trips back to Bachi Burger whenever in Vegas. Although, I heard that they may be opening one in LA?
Very good, nice environment, and friendly staff. We had the Kiki and Spicy Bistro, both were excellent. The sweet potato fries are the best I've had. Will defiantly come back.
Ate here on friday 10/4, after seeing it on diners drive in and dives. We had the oxtail chili cheese fries, the ronin and the kalbi burger. It was honestly one of the best meals ive ever had in my life! Growing up in hawaii, it really had a lot of local flavors that I missed! The service was great too!
This is our FAVORITE Burger place ,off the strip.. The Asian-Fusion style that the chef has created are so filled with flavor!. But don't worry, you can have classics if you prefer.. . We always bring people here because it is fun, lively and delicious!. A few tips.- The Pork Belly buns may not seem like an obvious choice in a burger place, but they are amazing! The The Miyagi-San burger- OMG. The garlic-truffle edamame. Yes, just do it!. . Love this place!
DELISSSHHHHHH!!!. . omg I've been to this place twice and both times were great. their chili fries is the bomb. it's huge, melty and tasty! I also tried their burgers both times. I forgot what I ordered the first time, but for my second visit I got their special burger with baked scallop on top of the burger patty. that burger was like a surf and turf in a bun. I like that the scallops made the burger not as heavy. ahhh I wish they open one in LA area so I can go more often!
My husband and I really enjoy this place.  I'm not normally a burger person but this is sooooo good that I forget they are burgers!
Buns were better than Umami Burger's. I can't give a better and more detailed review because I had only tasted a bite (too full from earlier) However, the truffled fries were much better at Umami. This place is open until 1am on Fridays and Saturdays. And it's merged with the Ramen place next door, so they have the Ramen menu available as well! Another reason to come back another time.
In a town like Las Vegas where it's very difficult to sift through all of the countless restaurants it's refreshing to find one that has quality, and value. The Miyagison burger is a "bucket list" burger. The best in the world.
MY FAVORITE BURGER PLACE EVER. It is far from the strip, but worth the drive.  Way bigger portions than Umami, about the same price. Loved the Miyagi burger- it has an egg and lots of great Asian-fusiony flavors. The ox-tail fries and the garlic fries are also amazing. They also have good drinks (like boba) and ramen (but get a burger). Can't wait for the one in LA to open up! Only con is that its usually busy and takes a while to get seated. Totally worth the wait though! (:
this place was more hype than anything, i was there last year with a friend for SEMA and we had heard about this place on where else. they made it was the best thing since sliced bread. we talk about going there to try it. first when we got there it took us forever to get seated (which i thought was a good thing) we ended up being seated in like the very back by the toilets. the service was terrible, i was served a coke and it was flat! when i asked for another one i was given attitude. so on to the food, i ordered the mr miyagi burger and my friend ordered the bahn mi burger. mr miyagi wasn't horrible but wasn't all that into it. my friend let me try the bahn mi burger and it tasted like there was way too much going on. i realized i would have been better off just going for bahn mi sandwiches for maybe 8 bucks and had better quality. we ordered the chili fries and they were  about the only thing that was good. they were not bad. but overall my experience sucked. (oh and i think the fact i could smell the stank from the bathroom didn't help) . . so maybe for a once in a lifetime trip would be cool if you dont eat much asian food, but if you do avoid it, way too pricey (2 burgers, 1 beer and two sodas and fries was a little more than 50 bucks) and seems to be just the hipster place to go!
Loved this place. Great atmosphere and friendly attentive staff. Would definitely come back. The sweet potato fries are hands down the best I've ever eaten.
Celebrating for Spartan Race we wanted to reward ourselves. Assuming everything in The Strip would be packed for dinner we decided to try avoiding the chaos and thought Bachi Burger wouldn't be packed...we were semi-correct. A decent wait for some delicious food.. . Ambiance: . * Parking | It is plaza parking so it is quite busy.. * Seating | A fair amount of seating, about 50-70 people bar or group seating.. * Feels | Typical restaurant feel with trance/electric music and definitely always crowded.. . Food:. Caramel Milkshake | Sweet and caramelly. The smoothie smoothly went through the straw and was enjoyable with every strip. Red Velvet Milkshake | The concept of red velvet is overrate but even I gave in. No regrets delicious it was. . Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries | Definitely a unique taste with the oxtail, egg, cheese and the additional appetizers. This is plentiful so do share.. Truffle Parmesan Fries |  Typical yet delicious truffle parmesan fries. If you are in the mood for something lighter, go for this.. Banh Mi Burger | Where to begin? The delicious mix of pork, shrimp and vinegar just to name a few made these american feel into a good asian fusion.. Mr. Ho's Burger | The sausage and mushrooms were delicious, juicy, and had awesome texture.. . Customer Service:. * We waited for about 20-30 minutes. It's strange we walked us in and escorted us to the back patio to wait where we just sat and listened to trance/electric music. Other than that the servers were attentive and fixed my order when there was a problem, no charge!. . Overall: . * 5 stars. A very unique burger place, I can't think of any place. The wait was fairly respectable and worth it. The customer service was excellent and the food was unforgettably delicious: the creative marinations and combinations of lemongrass, fish sauce, pickled vegetable just to name a few... I would definitely come back and try their other menu items. Till next time, Bachi Burger!. . . Advice:. * Come during non-common business ours.
I'd heard about this place for months and, when I'd driven by at lunch time, there always seemed to be a line out front. Finally went to lunch there. It did not live up to the hype. A burger that was mediocre and pricey. Fries were ok, but not astounding. The staff wasn't attentive as I'd expect. They messed up not one, but two of my party's orders.
The hype is real, people!. . Prior to coming to Vegas, I was recommended by a friend to come check out this place. From my belief, there are 2 locations both off the strip. We went to the Windmill location which was about 20 minutes away. When we got there at 11am, there was already a small line starting to form. I got the grass-fed wagyu burger. It was good but it was a little bit on the sweeter side and I don't like my burgers sweet. I also got a chance to try the spicy miso burger. That was a little salty for me, but again, still very good. The winner of the day? The oxtail chili cheese fries. You will dieeee. Must get!!! . . Since our meal was so good, we decided to come back a second time the next day before leaving Vegas. This time around we tried the ramen. It's really rare that a burger joint would also serve ramen, let alone be good at it so I was extremely skeptical. BUT, much to my surprise, the ramen was so good as well! My favorite is the spicy ramen with extra meat. Their meat is sooo fatty and melts in your mouth but it's so good. I suppose being a fatty every once in a while is no biggie :). . Their service is amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive. I will come back here every time I'm in town!
This is my new burger favorite.  And will be one of those iconic vegas eateries I HAVE to eat before heading back to LA.  . . I was so impressed.  Foodwise.  Their service was lackluster as they were understaffed. And our server was seldom seen.  . . I had the shogun burger. But eventually, tasted everyones burger at our table. everyone had something different and everyone couldn't stop raving about their burger.. . i think my favorite was the miyagi san. Egg, Fried Onion Rings and a zesty patty. MM MM!!!. . Also notable are the bao sandwiches.  They tasted amazing.. . Will definitely be back.
I have always loved Bachi... Their "Lonely Bird" has always been a favorite of mine. However, everytime my fiance and I go to the Henderson location the service continues to get worse and worse and worse. This last time I went the hostess was so rude to us, and our server I think barely knew we existed. The food was good I would just love to see the service get better to how it was before.. . p.s.. For the love all things delicious, will someone please bring back that amazing chocolate and green tea homemade pop tart!?!?!!?!?
Five star burgers. Just go.  Asian fusion theme with super quality ingredients and prices are amazingly reasonable for the quality provided
This place would give Umami Burger in LA a run for its $$. . . Recommend:. Shogun Burger. Miso Burger. Pork Belly Bao in the Peking Duck style. Pickled Onions. . Did feel it for the truffle fries with gravy. Got cold fast.... . This place is ALSO a Ramen House.
Decided to check this place out due to the great reviews on yelp and we were not disappointed. . . Party of 3 order:. . Appetizer . Calamari - only thing special  about this dish was the sauce and hint of sesame oil...won't order again. Truffle parmesan fries - not bad but will use the precious space in my tummy for maybe the oxtail fries next time . . Entree .  Pork belly Steamed bun - tastes like Filipino  siopao!. Spicy Miso burger - not spicy at all but very good nonetheless. We were worried about how well the apple vingerette would taste in the burger but it was very subtle.. Kids burger - my 9 year old son devoured it and said it tasted 'fresh'. Be careful with add ons...my son wanted cheese which tacked on $1.50 to his $10 meal. . Dessert. Portuguese donuts w/coffee  Gelato - nothing special about this dish. Was basically a donut hole smothered in cinnamon.. Chocolate peanut butter souffle - came with vanilla ice cream and some blueberry sauce. It was much better than the donuts but would probably skip it next time and get dessert  elsewhere.. . Service. Our waitress Emily was ok. She asked us if this was our first time there to which we responded "yes". Usually this is their cue to tell us a little about the menu or make recommendations. Instead she responded with a "okay let me know if you have any questions". She was not the most attentive and we had to ask other employees  to grab our waitress for us multiple times. . . Overall it was a good experience and we definitely  plan on coming back to try out the rest of the menu items
This establishment greatly disappointed me. When me and my mom arrived, there would be a 10-minute wait which was perfect because we were still waiting for my friend while she was on her way. We really wanted to sit outside but they wouldn't allow it because they didn't have enough staff. How do they not know how to properly staff for a Saturday at noon? When my name was finally called for my party of 3, they wouldn't seat us because my friend wasn't present, like its some 5-star fine-dining establishment. She was literally in the parking lot and I could see her in her gold Prius pulling in to a spot when my name was called. Then, when my friend got inside they didn't have enough menus for us so they couldn't seat us again! How does a restaurant not have enough menus? We were rushed the entire time and they kept asking if we were done 3 or 4 times while we were eating and kept trying to take our plates because they wanted our table. . . This isn't a fine-dining restaurant! Get off your high-horse, Bachi Burger. We won't be back.
Great food and presentation, great service, great atmosphere always clean. my third visit there every one is positive. I love latest rammen addition to the menu and sapporo on tap. One of my favs in town. Must try.
Can you say over rated. I have noticed any place that's featured on a tv show like diners  dives and drive ins is avoid. The restaurant was busy and waited about 20 min during lunch rush. I didn't like the place as soon as I walked in. It felt like a night club with the music blaring. I don't mind some mood music but when I have to shout to have a conversation then there's a problem. . . Let's get to the food, ordered the oxtail chili with very little meat for $15 it was decent but not $15 good for some fries and chilli.. . There was three of us and we all ordered different burgers. The problem with the fish burger was that the fish fell apart as you ate the burger so the fish was basically falling off the buns. The mr ho burger had way too much sauce on it and my grandma couldn't eat it. The problem with these burgers were that they were way to busy, multiple sauces that conflict with the burger itself. . I felt for the price the burger could have been bigger. Lunch for three over $60.. I also thought their non alcohol specialty drinks were way over priced.
Great food as always, great service from Kelly H. - she was very patient with all of my wife's questions. I had a burger and the wife had the pot stickers. We  definitely recommend the Ox tail fries......AWESOME.
I went to this location on 9/26 for lunch. It was OK. I ordered the spicy miso burger protein style and it was fine. It wasn't bad, it was even pretty good. It is just hard to get excited about this place. The service is OK. Not good but not bad. Definitely slow and not attentive. . . Unless someone orders their fries as an appetizer, they probably want them with their meal, not 20 minutes ahead of time.  The house made pickles were good. . . I was excited to see that they have Boba, but I didn't try it. I would not choose to go back, but if a friend wanted to, I would go with them.
