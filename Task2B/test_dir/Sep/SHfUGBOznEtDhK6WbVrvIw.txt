Schwartz has some very good smoked meat, that has to be said. I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it is definitely worth going. The fact that people wait in line for so long is a testament to its quality. . . On the other hand, the aforementioned waiting time is too long (it feels like trying to get into a packed club) and the service is terrible, which pretty much ruins it for me. They will pack you inside wherever they can, and nobody really pays any attention to you. I understand that they are always extremely busy, but I'd rather go to a different deli where i can actually eat comfortably...
First time in Montreal and first time at Schwartz's.  It's a simple, humble and very friendly place serving surprisingly great smoked brisket.  The meat was so tender, juicy (glistening fat, love it!) and just all-around good!  The people there are so nice and friendly, not to mention patient.  Service is quick paced but as a first time diner, I was not rushed to order.  Overall, great experience.  Also, they take US and Canadian currency.  It was my last day in Montreal and I did not have enough Canadian bills to pay for the meal (cash only place). and even though they have an ATM available, they took my US bills as well.  I paid with a mixture of US and Canadian money and I felt bad about it, but they said "No Worries!" with genuine smiles and off I went on my way.
Smoked meat sandwich! You just have to try it here! The sandwich is huge but very very tasty. It was fatty and delicious. It also wasn't dry and every bite was devoured in a detailed manner. For me, I always judge a sandwich by it'sbread to meat ratio and this rocked my world! Must eat when in Montreal.
Getting this to go, at the separate entrance, was extremely quick. . . The sandwich is not exactly "deli style" in portion, as a person can easily finish 1.5 to 2 of these sandwiches. However, at $10 a sandwich, the value is still incredible compared to Katz's in NY, which is almost twice the price.. . As a New Yorker, a comparison is expected. I would love to say that "they" make it better than "us," but that is not the case.. . The bread is lacks some rye flavor and ability to hold up the sandwich. The meat is tender, fatty, and delicious, but a bit too fatty.
Probably a 3.5 star place in my opinion.   Schartz's is known for their smoked meats sandwiches.  Smoked meat / mustard on rye? bread.  The meat was moist and very tasty.   The bread is lacking in any flavor is and greatly over whelmed by the meat.  Worth a try, simple and good sandwich.
Une tres bonne adresse pour les amateurs de sandwichs pastrami. Le lieu merite sa reputation, j'y ai passe un moment agreable et savoureux.. . Le sandwich est a tomber, faites le choix d'une viande maigre si vous le souhaitez digeste, et plus grasse si vous le desirez fondant. Accompagnez le de frites, choux et d'une canette de black cherry soda pour un moment 100% "schawrt'sien".. . Aucune fausse note dans ce temple de la smoked meat.
La reputation de Schwartz n'est plus a refaire. C'est une institution,  on y croise a differentes heures de la journee dans ce petit resto qui a su garder son cachet des personnes de tout horizons qui partagent la meme envie manger de la bonne viande fumee,  la meilleure!
My husband the carnivore, LOVED this place. He said the meat was smoked and tender and just amazing. There's a long line to eat inside the restaurant, but the take out line is short and you can grab a stool by the counter and eat there as well. Excellent quality and soft and juicy strips keep you well fed in the cold!
I tried the smoked meat since it's a big thing in Montreal. It was good, but not anything I would go out of my way to have again. I think all the hype made it a bit of a disappointment. . . I also have mixed feelings about the staff. One woman, while polite once we got her attention, was completely oblivious to us, her face buried in her phone.. . The guy who served us was rude, and short with us because we sat in the wrong spot. . . Overall, not a place I would want to return.
My husband (the American and stingy with his stars) has had his fair share of NY deli meats (pastrami/corned beef) so I was a bit nervous about bringing him here since for me their smoked meat is simply the best. He tried it and loved it! So much so that we had it again before we left Montreal, but this time taking it out (don't let the long lines ruin your experience!).
I Waited for about half an hour to get a seat. It's quite a small place without much decorations, not really a restaurant in some sense. But the meat is amazing! I placed oreder for smoked meat sandwich and cherry coke. The meat in sandwich really far too much for me, but tasty!
Tem esses lugares em que vc vai, come o que todo mundo ta pedindo, meio que no fluxo da turistada, e, de repente se da conta que comeu algo tao bom que vc nao vai esquecer jamais? . O Schwartz e assim. Uma carne que derrete na boca, temperada no ponto, pode ser servida como sanduiche ou em prato aberto (o q comi). . Recomendadissimo pra mim e, agora, por mim.
came to montreal for vaca.. . very long line only if you want to dine in.  . . next door sandwich to go (there's also small seat in the back). . I ordered smoked meat sandwich.  Tasty, meaty and fatty.  just perfect with mustard.  I wish the portion a little bigger.
I think this one is a no brainer for any tourist.. . The sandwich is so simple. Bread, mustard, then the intimate part of the sandwich, the smoked meat. Juicy, succulent, flavourful. I have to order 2 because it just tastes so damn good.. . Unless, for some reason, you have a bad experience on the service side of things, you will not regret coming here. Your taste buds will be partying in your mouth for days and then they'll be sad when the party stops.
Montreal icon ! Un Excellent et chaleux service. un smoked meat unique! Je vous conseille d'en faire un 1 by week !
So finally, after many replicas (both good and bad), my quest for a smoked meat sandwich brought me here to Montreal, and my first stop was for the real deal at Schwartz's. No suprises - it was the real deal.. . Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?. . Schwartz's is the definition of no frills, but the friendly staff are accommodating even if the place is packed with a line out the door (which is likely). I grabbed a seat at the bar, asked for the goods, and had a steaming hot sandwich in front of me in no time. Star Granted. . . Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?. . If they wanted, Schwartz's could easily charge a ridiculous premium for their sandwiches - but they don't, and my standard sammie came in at $8.70. Have a look:. . http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg&select=NMfOyuZAKwhLRoDtGWsdAw. . That's fair. Star Granted. . . Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?. . Make no mistake, this was absolutely marvelous. Sure, the bread and mustard are standard white and yellow, but the meat is absolutely heavenly. Slow smoked so that it's tender, but the consistency is maintained to where it doesn't fall apart and the flavor mixes a nice lean cut with just the right band of fat and seasoning. Brilliant. Dual Stars Granted. . . Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?. . It's damn close, but as hard as it might be to believe, on one occasion I had a smoked meat sandwich that was better than this on account of the slightly better bread and equal meat:. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mile-end-delicatessen-brooklyn-brooklyn?select=f-3HfCK5xgXY82ARMEbeHw&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg#f-3HfCK5xgXY82ARMEbeHw. . So, that exists, which makes it such that I can't quite go with the full five stars here. Make no mistake, you should absolutely come to Schwartz's as it's the best in the city by a mile, but it didn't quite secure the crown. No Star Granted.
