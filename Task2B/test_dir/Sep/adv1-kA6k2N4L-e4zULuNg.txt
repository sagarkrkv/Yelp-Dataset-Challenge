Venue:  Fremont Street Experience. . Decor: Touristy. . Service: Depends on the Establishment & Vendors...will vary. . Environment: Fun. . Food: Multiple options.  . Prices:  Inexpensive.  . Debbie Downers:  Pay for Parking.  . Conclusion: Cool place to go in and out on foot without vehicular traffic.  It is an American staple.  Similar to Bourbon Street, similar to Beale St....the Fremont Street Experience is a different world outside of the Strip to go in and out of different venues without walking a whole lot.  You will see a lot of characters but in all ...a good time and something to do while visiting from out of town..  . Overall: B
This is cool to experience but not worth the hassle to get down here on a weekend evening. It's so busy and full of crazy people, and the light show is super low resolution and just meh. It's an interesting display, but the content of the light show is boring and the shows in the street are seriously lame. The dancing "hotties" aren't into it - I dance harder in my Zumba class and I have a bad hip.
This saved our Vegas trip.  We got there around 7 pm on a Friday night.  Lots of really good free entertainment.   1 dollar margaritas and cheap food.  We had steak and lobster for 12 dollars.  We will be staying here next time we come to Vegas.  Also not one person trying to sell us a time share.
I love Fremont  Street!! I can't come to Vegas without coming here. It's like a different world compared to The Strip, it does get crowded but nothing like the strip and not as touristy and rowdy. It's my favorite place to gamble because I usually win and my money lasts longer, I can play the same money on the same slot machine for HOURS.. . This is the "Original Vegas" and you would have to be crazy not to come here and it's also known as the coveted street. At night they usually have a light show that happens periodically throughout the night. Aside from gambling and the light show  there are other interesting places here such as Slotzilla which is the biggest slot machine and it's also a zip liner, the infamous Heart Attack Grill which has been featured on the food network among lots of various entertainment.. . They usually have music playing, bands, and people doing other entertainment. When night falls it does get interesting and some people let it all hang out literally lol. This is the place to go for good gambling, cheap food, entertainment and a break from the strip.
I'm just not a fan of Fremont Street.  As much as it is trying to be revived, and people love it, I feel as though it is just dirty.  Fremont street is not my personal cup of tea, and I think I'll pass.  I won't bash it because I know some people love it.  I'll just say that it is not for me.  It just does not feel comfortable to me.
I've worked in IT for 20 years, am a lifelong tech geek, and a Trekkie.  It takes A LOT to impress me when it comes to technology.  So when I saw my first light and music show on the canopy I got the chills and misty-eyed!  It's really freaking amazing.  We are going to Las Vegas again this weekend and specifically staying on Fremont Street just for this experience!  . . Fremont Street used to be the "old, dirty, gritty Vegas" but isn't anymore.  It's a huge tourist attraction where you can walk around, take pictures with people in wild costumes, drink crazy drinks, and watch live bands play.  There are tons of stores, restaurants, and casinos that you can spend hours going in and out of.  . . While I love the strip and think the resorts there are beautiful, they are just too big for me.  The hotels on Fremont are old, classic places and are smaller and much easier to navigate.  Plus you can walk on Fremont Street comfortably....unlike the Strip!
Disgusting. I don't like it. A lot of crazy people, very dirty. Homeless people. We took bus here, it took more than 1 hour because of traffic. The big screen was nothing special.
I haven't been back here in a few years simply because this place is the opposite of the strip.  However, My friend and I came down here this past Friday night because he hadn't been in downtown since this "new look."  We immediately noticed the lack of good looking, well dressed women.  Instead we saw plenty of mid-western looking folks & their kids, seniors, urban ghetto folks, out of shape ppl, etc..... We hung out for an hour because the drinks were cheap while he marveled at the zipline, show stages, street performers & so on.  I finally suggested we needed to get back to the action on the strip before this place brings me down.
First visit here with family. We walked to Fremont Exp from our hotel Downtown Grand. I had a 10 year old girl with me and there was nothing for her there except the zip line which we did not do. We walked around the lighting and music and the stores on the street. Nothing like The Strip but you should visit once.
A lot has changed at Fremont street. We've been coming here for years and every year its something different. The Canopy light shows are pretty cool but i wish they brought back the Queen tribute I really like that and they didnt play it when we went on a Friday night. Still a cool place though and you see a lot of interesting things. This is where you see some of oldest casinos in Vegas. Some of the originals long before Bellagio and Mandalay Bay.
