Avid yelpers....My husband and I saw the 844 averaged 4 star reviews and tried this place out. Yelp led us astray. It was absolutely terrible. TERRIBLE! We had the ceviche which was OK...then everything got progressively worse. I had the tacos- crane asada and pork. The carne asada was inedible- I literally had to keep spitting out bits of meat because they were so chewy. The pork was so dry I could barely choke it down. Handmade corn tortillas didn't help- so dry. Cheese quesadilla was bland and served cold. My husband ordered the torta- terrible quality bread- most of his meat was in edible and lacking in flavor. We were hopefully but this was The worst $50 we have ever spent. Spare yourself!
Nothing wrong with hotel restetaunts, but they normally are not my cup of tea.  Gallo Blanco, however, breaks the mold. Greeted warmly by the hostess we were seated directly below a large fan. We asked to move, no problem, we were moved to our table of choice with a smile. . . Our server ( ?Dre)  was very good, offering suggestions when asked, otherwise non intrusive and allowed us to enjoy our food. ( see my photos).  After drinks (an ok yet refreshing Sangria and a well mixed Henricks G & T with lime) we ordered an Ahi appetizer with guac and chips-- very light, thin slices of the tuna.  Then we  enjoyed a salad, the name I cant recall, which had corn nuts and again, a light vinaigrette dressing. Finally, we ordered a spread of tacos wanting to try a wide variety. The moist, flavorful carna asade taco was my favorite, with the fish and veggie tacos on hand made corn tortillas a close second place.  The special, a seared tuna taco, was my least favorable.  While it was well made and the fish tender and fresh, it was too large of a chunk and really should have been diced or sliced.. . We ordered the Street Corn as a suggestion from our server, and wow was it good, spiced up, well cooked ( steamed??) with perhaps cheese on top. A great addition and actually should come automatically with any meal. It really is that good. . . Feeling thoroughly stuffed, we split the orange cake along with fresh brewed decaf. The cake was full of orange flavor, zest, and the right amount of sweetness.. . The ENTIRE bill for two was  73 bucks. Well worth it and frankly a great deal- alcohol drinks, sodas, appetizer, salad, five tacos, desert, coffee x 2.  . . Finally, kids below the age of 10 eat free.
Great food! . . Really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. Ordered the chips and salsa with guacamole. The guac is really good! I enjoyed the citrus in it. I also got the street tacos as well. Great stuff.
Had the sampler breakfast and it was wonderful.  Scrambled eggs,  bacon, pancake.   With fresh orange juice . . The service was slow and friendliness seemed forced at times
The food is excellent! The service is terribleeee... Especially at the bar, the staff is friendly but it seems a little disorganized as their priorities always seem to be the well & not the guests. Food is to DIE for however!
Pure debauchery! BLAND ASS BULLSHIT. We got the huevos rancheros, chiliquilles verde, and banana peanut pancakes. The first two were boring and tasteless. The pancake - barely mediocre. I should've stayed home and had cereal, or grabbed breakfast burrito to go at filibertos for $2.50. Do not come here for breakfast.
Went here with my girlfriend for Happy Hour food, and everything was great! We had the guacamole, corn, and some tacos. . . My only difficulty was finding parking, but I am also stubborn so that's probably why I became so frustrated.
Spectacular food! Pork belie and Ahi Tuna Tacos with guacamole need I say more?. . Awesome atmosphere, great selection for kids as well.. . Oh and coffee, yeah they serve Lux coffee great roaster!
Great food, lousy service.  I've been coming to this place for years and I've never had good, prompt service.  Servers always appear to be hanging out by the bar pretending to be busy.  If this place didn't have great food I would never return.
Build Club was putting a structure on top of the roof of the hotel for an upcoming Art Event. After a long day of work we ordered food from the Gallo Blanco, the Hotel's in house Restaurant and boy were we not disappointed. The menu was a awesome mix of mexican and awesome. The Salsa and Guacamole were yummy, I had a Tuna Crudo that was spicy and orange with twist. They brought out all of our food right out to our cabana. great service and Great food! I'll be back soon!
It's a great date night in relaxing atmosphere.   Great food.  Also great for vegetarians.  Great food.
Hostess was not very nice but Good servers  made up for it. Very nice smiles. Happy hour margarita was ok.  Burrito was great, loved the tomatillo sauce.
We've been twice and both times the food was excellent where as the service was poor. Its too bad because regardless of the quality of the food, if the service is substandard it effects the overall experience. Step it up management (take some pointers from your kitchen staff)!
I heard good things so I took my team for lunch yesterday, unfortunately I was not impressed. 3 at best because of the homemade tortillas and green chile.. The fish tacos were overcooked? dry and bland. An unusually long wait for the food. The server was ok, hostess not the happiest person. I wouldn't go back.
Consistently great food and service.  Wonderful for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Good atmosphere  open airy and artful.  We love their flapjacks and tuna tacos!. Bring the family there is something for everyone here
Went to Gallo Blanco for dinner and placed a Togo order. Being that it is my first time in Phoenix I figured lets check out what the people of yelp had to say about dinner options. I ordered the queso fundido which was made up of melted Oaxaca cheese with vegetables Served with chips and tortillas. I did not enjoy their version of queso at all. I also ordered a carne asada burrito which happen to be one of the best burritos I have had in a while. The burrito was packed with lots of flavor I would have to say my favorite parts were the tender grilled ribeye and fire salsa flavors. I did notice that the host was rude and food took 27 minutes for a Togo order which is crazy to me.
Excellent place! I would go back there no doubt!
