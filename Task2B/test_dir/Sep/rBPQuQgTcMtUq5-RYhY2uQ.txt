3 stars...AT BEST.. . After going to Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon....I really don't know how other buffets can compete.. . Sunday Brunch with champagne included: $30.99 per person WITHOUT Total Rewards Players Card. I think it's $29.99 for TR members.. . Food selection wasn't really good. VERY small section of Italian, no Asian dishes except for fake, gross sushi. No Mexican section either. There were plenty of breakfast dishes though....yes, I know I went here for "brunch" but damn....it was almost 1pm when we got seated. I would at least expect there to be more lunch options versus breakfast... They got some good soups (potato leek and creamy chicken), nice "french" breads and bagels, some fancy cheese options.. . Dessert was kind of a let down. No gelato. They only had a cheap ice cream machine with the usual chocolate and vanilla flavors. They do however have macaroons (yes...they advertise that like crazy), parents enjoyed the caramel brulee and the lemon cream pie. . . I came. I tried. I'm NOT coming back.
I've been here twice for the weekend brunch.. . For being a buffet, the food is great. Everything I got tasted good. Our server was on top of things and kept our mimosas filled.  Couldn't be happier. It will remain at the top of my list for buffet brunch.. . The funny part? We enjoyed this buffet more than we enjoyed the overrated bacchanal buffet.
We had a groupon for this buffet. when we got there we did not have the page with the bar code and could not remember our passwod to get into Groupon to find our deal. The manager was very  nice and said she would honor our deal anyway. The prime rib was excellent and  everything else we had was good and what we didnt have  looked good! Would recommend this Las Vegas buffet. We will definitely go back next time we are in town.
I love to experience vegas buffets and this one did not disappoint! The food was high quality and delicious. The ambiance was superb, I felt like I was eating in a cute little village in Paris. I absolutely loved the variety they had and how it was sectioned. They also had a crepe station where the chef prepares the crepe exactly how you want it.
Went for breakfast at 9:30am on a Tuesday and at a time when the freshest food should have been available (there was quite a wait to get in) everything tasted stale.  The bagels, the english muffins used in the eggs benedict, and even the potato triangles (hash browns) were all so hard that they either crumbled or you couldn't cut through them.  The scrambled eggs were watery and the lox were presented on a plate where half looked a few days old and the other half looked somewhat fresh. How does a big hotel like this justify the poor food quality?  You're better off leaving the hotel and going to a real breakfast restaurant, and you probably won't have to wait to get uninspired, and in some cases inedible food.  Big disappointment.
The best part of the buffet is the crepe station. everything else was just meh. Five stars for the sweet  menu on  and the banana crepe with nutella and toasted hazelnuts. Bomb!
Everything is delicious , the view is beautifully design to look like an small French town, service is great!!!!!
Used a BOGO groupon and we got a free bottle of wine.  Very underwhelmed with this buffet....the food was pretty bland. The duck al'orange tasted like chicken and the baguette I had tasted really stale. The dessert buffet was only half full, one whole side of the are was empty.  For a 'French' dining experience, it makes me never really want to visit France! The best thing I had was the Yukon gold mashed potatoes and the creme brulee was ok (that is my favorite dessert so I was glad that at least tasted decent!)
Nothing really changed since the last time I was here. Food just palatable, desserts improved a bit. The prime rib dry like they cooked it earlier and it's been sitting around. Nothing that stands out. A lot of duplicate dishes done slightly different. For $32 that's with tax for dinner it's not worth it unless your a gambler and get a comp or need a quick bite. I would pass plenty of other buffets to choose with bigger selection if your into buffets. I was in a rush and got a comp so ate it today but like I always say never eat at a Vegas buffet it's only a tourist trap with crappy food most of the time. . On a positive note service was decent.
Le village buffet dessert has a 33% acceptable rating per Jon. The creme brulee was at least brulee'd here; however the creme lacked body and flavor. Cheese cake was the usual central kitchen fail. The eclaire was stale and creme was the same failed concoction in most of their desserts. The only acceptable dishes offered was their macaroons and flan. Macaroons were soft and moist with good flavor. Flan had body and was covered in light simple syrupy that doesn't over power the flan. This concludes the dessert review of le village buffet
Had breakfast and dinner in this buffet, so far so good . From prime rib too Asian roll, split crab leg and shirmp, soups, Mediterranean cuisine and crepes made to order savory or sweet and desserts my favorite creme brulee and macarons.  Yummy :). . Event sweeter deals if you buy buffet of buffet which is 24 hours buffet to buffet wristbands.
I love the food here.  I've done 24 hours buffet and I keep on coming back every I visit Vegas,  The only thing is the line can be a problem.... especially on the weekend.  My favorite is the desert section.
I always find myself coming back here.. I think it's the decor and extensive buffet.  I love the brunch!!
I thought this place was okay. I felt like it used to be better and many years ago the lines extended forever. I was surprised to just walk up with no wait (for a Sat night dinner) and I guess I should have suspected that perhaps the quality of the food just isn't quite the same. I thought everything was fine but I don't know if I would go back. In that sense, it's pretty disappointing.
Amazing -- all you can eat crab legs neatly sawed open for you to eat on the half shell for quick/easy eating---delectable!!. . Prime rib like butter!!. . Crepe station with the most sophisticated savory crepe combos -- makes it all worth it.. . Fresh-grilled tri-tip or chicken.. . Individual Creme Brulee's or various fancy Macaroons!!. . Personable service.. . Go.
