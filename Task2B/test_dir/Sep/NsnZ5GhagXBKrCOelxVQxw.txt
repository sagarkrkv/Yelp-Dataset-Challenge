Food was delicious. Ordered a bunch of small plates and the miso glazed sea bass . The sea bass was definitely the star , moist flaky and delicious. Would have been a five star review but the service wasn't the best . had too ask for the check three times. Waitress wasnt paying much attention to our section. Wil definitely go back and try something new.
Great food and great service.  . . Sushi Samba located inside the Palazzo Hotel offers great ambiance and excellent food.  The only drawback is it can get quite noisy during their peak hours so if your looking to have a nice quiet dinner this is not the place.  Also the food will take a bit long so don't come when your starving or you will be annoyed.  . . The rolls were excellent and tasted very fresh.  Their steak with the chimichurri sauce was also another one of my favorites.  The portions are not huge so it's good to order more than just a few dishes when you are sharing.  It adds up pretty quickly so be prepared.  . . Overall a great experience and definitely will return to try some other dishes.
Love this place, I make it a point to eat here every Vegas trip.  The foie gras tuna sushi is simply the best.  Very cool atmosphere and located right in the mall!
Place was simple amazing. Sushi was fresh and drinks were amazing. The service for being a busy holiday weekend was fast and attentive. Missing the sushi and drinks!!!
I have eaten here in the past but stopped by again so I could critically evaluate the food  for a Yelp review.  I arrived ~ 2 pm and was promptly seated.  There was a moderate amount of ambient noise with the music, but I liked the fun atmosphere of the place.  I ordered the Yamato and Sao Paulo rolls since they looked like the most interesting rolls on the menu.. . The food arrived rather quickly.  The yamato roll really looked spectacular with the gold leaf, but there were only three pieces and there was a sweet sauce that completely overpowered the roll so I could not taste the foie gras.  The sauce was tasty, but it would have been nice if the right balance were achieved.. . The sao paolo roll had a variety of fish topping the rolls, and it was quite tasty, but not worth $24.. . My server was attentive and polite.  While the food was good, it was way overpriced given the multitude of dining options on the strip.
This sushi is trying to hard. Apparently people only like this place because it's "trendy". We ordered the best two rolls and they were basically overpriced shitty California rolls compared to the decently priced and delicious sushi that we experience in Houston, TX.
I had been wanting to try this place since I moved here. The quality of the sushi was excellent and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. However, this place was a little out of my price range and not the typical sushi joint you would find me at. I prefer simple classic sushi and this place was a little too abstract for me. If price isn't an issue and you like an adventure I would definitely recommend this place!
No es un restaurante japones al uso, se trata de una combinacion, tal como su nombre indica de cocina y musica, algo que podria resultar un rechazo si se quiere un lugar tranquilo donde cenar.. Su cocina es fusion japonesa y con otras cocinas sobre todo con la brasilena como es de esperar por el nmbre de la cadena, aii que lo mejor es que te dejes aconsejar por su amable personal
I always enjoy Sushi Samba.  It's a great mix of Brazilian and Japanese.  Some concepts work better than others but even the basic stuff is done right.  Salmon sushi - that's how I know if a place does sushi well - is great here.  I also loved some of the creative dishes - the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and lemongrass was wonderful.   But the killer dish to get - the Moqueca Mista!  Shrimp, scallops, mussels in a coconut broth with chimichurri rice!!!  Heaven!. . Only real issue are their prices.  If you are prepared for the prices, it's worth a trip.
Went to Vegas to celebrate 29th wedding anniversary. Went late at night around 11pm after peak crowds. They close at 1am. Our waiter Michael D was great at explaining the menu.  The sea bass was great and just melts in your mouth. I enjoyed the pork belly ramen (spicy). Service was great by everyone. I inquired about cold sake and he offered Dewazakura Dewasansan Junmai Ginjo. It has a light and subtle fruity flavor. Very nice. He topped our evening off with a nice chocolate cake topped with ice cream in a maple syrup. Delicious. We will definitely back.
Hubby and I decided to take a stroll down the strip.  Since we were staying at the Encore we had to pass through the Palazzo.  We decided to go through the grand canal shoppes to take advantage of the AC since it was 110 outside.  We walked by Sushi Samba and really liked the ambiance so we decided to have a late lunch there.. . We had the Rio Grande ($45) which came with rib eye, wagyu picante, and a chicken sausage.  It also came with a serving of rice, beans, and various sauces to dip the aforementioned proteins.. . The wagyu picante and rib eye were both melt in your mouth delicious :).  I wish we had a little more rice to go with the meats though.. . The highlight of the night is definitely the sushi here.  (Hey, maybe that's why they named the restaurant SUSHIsamba.)  We ordered the Samba Sushi 7 Piece with the Green envy roll ($26).  The fish tasted fresh and the Green Envy roll is delicious!!. . The service here was fantasic and we will definitely be back.
AMAZING! A must stop for anyone in Vegas.  Staff was very helpful with food and drink selections.  Best Sake selection I have seen in the US.  I will definitely return again as for the price and what you get it is a no-brainer :)
My experience at SushiSamba was amazing. Lively atmosphere and great vibe. The service was impeccable; very attentive. Some of our dishes took a little longer than usual (it was a Saturday night) but they let us know right away and we didn't mind. The Tuna Tataki was very fresh and theSamba Strip and Green Envy rolls were delicious. They even brought out a birthday dessert for me which was thoughtful. Definitely would recommend this restaurant for dinner.
SushiSamba continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here with a group of 40 on 8/30. The staff couldn't have been anymore accommodating and friendly. The menu options satisfied everyone's needs. Everything was served family style which we all likes. The firecracker shrimp, truffle aioli and the strip steak were so delicious. My friends and family loved the fun and hip atmosphere. If you ever want to have a group meal I think it doesn't get much better than this!
Ok. I've been to Las Vegas too many times to count. All I can say after our first time dining at Sushi Samba is...Nobu who? I can't even begin describe the amazing service we received and the quality of the food. . . We started at the bar with drinks and appetizers and had to wait awhile to be seated, even though there were more than a few tables open our only downside, and the manager brought us a round of his favorite drink to make up for it. Thanks! . . The must orders (and we ordered them twice they were that good): Sea bass. Melt in your mouth. Kobe beef dumplings. More please! They wrapped it all in one amazing ball of bliss when they brought out the Bubbie's mochi ice cream for dessert. Seriously?! My home state mochi?!? In Vegas!?!! Amazing. . . Mike Donbrowski, our server...you gave us the best, most on point suggestions. This was the highlight meal of our trip. No words but these above. So good I had to mention you by name. Hope you don't mind! We will so be back. Thank you for making our night!
this place is overrated in my opinion. i've definitely had better sushi, and i was very disappointed. i had heard about sushi samba for many years, so i was very excited to finally try it out. . . for our appetizer, we ordered the kobe beef dumplings which were very flavorful. for our main dish we ordered three different rolls: bobo brazil, el topo, and carnaval. the carnval was my favorite, but still average, compared to other sushi i've had. the bobo brazil is topped with thin slices of wagyu beef, which i thought i would enjoy, but it was just mostly fat that you couldn't chew through. the carnaval comes with melted mozzarella cheese at the bottom, which i didn't find adding of any value to the taste. the only thing i did like at the restaurant was the non-alcoholic watermelon drink. it was sweet, sour, and refreshing which i loved. . . i didn't care for the ambiance or customer service either; our waitress barely came to our table and the place was too crowded. i'm glad i tried this place out, but i won't be coming back.
The food, ambiance, staff, management... Perfect! There are a lot of places to eat in Vegas, Sushi Samba is a must. One of the few places where the food and the staff makes the experience enjoyable. Jeremy and Nick were great!
Underwhelming and far from fresh sushi. I had the chef inspiration with the green envy roll. The nigiri was nothing special. There are much better places to eat sushi.
Excellent food and eclectic environment! Rolls were delicious and starters/aperitivos were larger than expected and delicious. Service was spot-on and not a bad thing to be said. Wasabi was REAL Wasabi, not dyed horseradish. Extremely fresh all around!
The place was packed, it was Friday night, and we did not have a reservation. I thought we were doomed, but we were able to be seated at the sushi bar in 5 minutes.. I have some food allergies and told the waitress what I couldn't eat. Despite her being clearly busy and running her butt off, she took the time to help guide me through the menu. And if she didn't know, she was ready and willing to find out (despite clearly being hella busy!). My cocktail was complex and intriguing (but supposedly spicy and it wasn't) and I'd love to try to figure out how to make it at home.. The plating was spectacular for all of the dishes. The standout was the shishito peppers (which I always love, but these were extra awesome.). The foie gras on one of my sushi rolls was a really nice touch.. . I'd give 10 stars for service, if I could. But my 4-star rating is for food alone. That said, I'd still really recommend giving it a go.
