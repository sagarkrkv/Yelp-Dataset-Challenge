Beautiful hotel!!! We had brunch at the country club for the jazz brunch. It was one of the best meals I've ever had. Top quality food and reasonably priced. One of the highlights of our trip .
My rating is for the customer service not the hotel. The hotel was great, good food with a lot of restaurants and Encore pool is a lot of fun. . . When I checked into the hotel the computer system was down and continued to stay down for quite amount of hours. I tried to get there early to set up the room since I was throwing a bachelorette party but couldn't get in and around 7:15pm I had to go talk to them again since we had dinner reservations at 7:45pm at another hotel and had to get ready still. The only reason they gave me one room key to only one of our rooms is cause I started crying. To top it off they call us at 1am to tell us our other room is ready but yet don't comp us for that night. They had the girls get ready in their spa and then check their luggage back in at the desk. . . Overall the only thing they did for us was give us food credit and comp the resort fee. I honestly believe they could have and should have done more for us since we only got one room at a time and the second room that was ready at 1am wasn't the right one, it only had one bed and the shower didn't work well so we had to have the girls in that room switch rooms again on Sat to one with two beds. . . There was a lot of inconveniences at this hotel that I wouldn't have expected and will not stay there again because of this. There are plenty of other nice hotels that aren't as expensive and will treat you a lot better.
Gorgeous casino, decor scheme seems to be taken from the Bellagio gardens- good mix of stores, restaurants, and gaming. Really appreciate how spacious this casino is, lots of space to walk around without cramming slot machines into every available nook.. . Service is typically very top notch, and restaurants on site are known for being able to accommodate any dietary restriction and have several vegan, vegetarian, and vegetable-laden options at each.. . Parking garage is smaller than most but easily accessible, casino itself is on the smaller side but more intimate and upscale rather than crowded and gaudy.
I love the tower suite!!!. From the moment we dropped off our car to checking in, the service was just great. . After the Bellman dropped off the luggage he offered to take my hubby's shirt off to get pressed and dry cleaned his uniform for a big day. He was such a nice guy!. We enjoyed playing at the casino, eating at the buffet, going to the show and hanging out at the pool for two days!. We would def come back to stay at the tower suite again.
Great hotel that has the most amazing scent. As soon as you walk into the hotel you smell it and it's wonderful!!
Omg!!! This place is just top notch. Everything in the room was luxurious. The room service lady was such a sweet heart. She clean both beds with new sheets, pillows, and blankets because one of the girl made a mess. She even change all the towels. :) The service in the front hotel desk has great customer service and so does all the dealers and management on the casino floors. Would love to come back and stay here again. By the way... The room was free. Which made it even better.
One of the best state that they had ever. Very clean and very comfortable. Good environment and good nothings fair. Very recommend it
I struggled with giving them 3 or 4 stars, butat the end of the day service was impeccable (Jazmine, Berta, JJ, Richard, Jose, guy who flagged me a cab, chef who made the woman next to me a special vegan, gluten free meal on the fly) so I leaned toward 4. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was they have horrible phone and internet connection! My calls got dropped several times over two days. And since I was here for work, no bueno. If this was a non-related work trip, 5 stars. But for the love of technology you need better connections!
I can only review the poker room here. The staff and tournaments are some of the best in Vegas. The cash games are also pleasant. I've played in almost every poker room in Vegas and this is one of the top 3. If you like poker, then you should play here, Bellagio and Venetian.
One of my favorite hotels to stay at because it's chic, classy, and caters to the chinese hahaha jk about the last one. I'm still figuring out what the theme is for this casino though. I think it's catered more towards Asians though because of the  red and yellow colored theme along with Asian decor/statues. It's connected directly w/ their newer casino Encore. You can walk from casino to casino without having to go out of one.. . Encore has surrender whereas Wynn has XS for the nightclubs. I've never had any problems with the rooms I've stayed at in the Wynn or Encore. After so many years, the Wynn still maintains cleanliness and hasn't lost its edge like Palazzo or Venetian. The bedding at the Wynn is very plush and comfy, no bed bugs. The pool area and buffet are great as wellCasino floor isn't bad either. Try signing up for a players card or e-mail to get promo discounts! Usually I get e-mails where if you book 2 night stays, you'll get buffet or spa comped, etc. . The only con is that this casino is located ALL THE WAY at the end of the strip so it can be a pain to get to
When an unforseen situation occured with a client of mine while staying at the Wynn, Trish in guest relations did amazing work to make everyting perfect.  She went beyond the call of dute to make sure the guest was taken care of, more then anything I have seen!  She is truly an asset to the Wynn and I can not wait to have the chance to meet her!  More places in Vegas can learn from her alone! Thanks again Trish!
Amazing pool! Enjoying this 90 degree weather in September!! Good times with great family and friends!!
Our stay at the Wynn was fantastic! Every single person who helped us, waited on us or dealt cards had the most thoughtful and professional demeanor. The resort is gorgeous and luxurious. We will return again and again. Nothing was wanting and the environment was exactly what we were looking for
Country club at Wynn not very good. Expect high prices in vegas, but this was just bland. Shrimp and grits bland an boring, porterhouse over cooked and not tasty.
Stayed here a couple times. Honestly palazzo is better deal to me/: the only thing I like more is the day pool here(:
