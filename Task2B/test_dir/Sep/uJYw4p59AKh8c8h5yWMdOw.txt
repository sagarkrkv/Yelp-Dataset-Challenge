I stayed there the first time I went to Vegas, it was alright..you have to pay for wifi. The lightings in the room was very dark..our views weren't that nice either. It was pretty cheap though. I love that Earl sandwich is just right down in the lobby!
Good location and a party atmosphere on the casino floor, but  I see that casinos are now charging $20 "early check-in" fee and they also add 12% tax to the $20/night "resort fee" ... this is definetly a great deal as I got extra hair with my reservation. Hair on the pillows, hair all over the bathroom floor, and stuck to the shower door, the shower walls, and even a few bonus short and crinkly ones in the shower swirling around in the slow-draining water.
I couldn't have possibly found a better hotel to celebrate my 21st birthday than Planet Hollywood. Working at a hotel, I am pretty critical of most properties and to know that when I checked out impressed with PH it was a great feeling. From check-in to check-out the customer service was top notch and something that I would praise. Upon check-in the staff was amazingly friendly and sincerely excited for my birthday! The process was quick and painless and in no time we were headed up to our room with Britney Spears room keys in hand! The view was amazing and I'm sure we were upgraded from a standard (booked the room at $45) to premium strip view/fountains because it was breathtaking from the 38th floor. Cleanliness of the room was superb and shot down all negative pictures and paranoia of stained sheets and mildew in strange areas. The casino had such a young hip feel to all of it that it didn't seem too outrageously fancy and just made me feel comfortable. The Britney Spears elevators had my fiance taking selfies left and right and partying to the music in them up to the room. The Axis theatre for Britney was very intimate and somewhere I know we will come back to. After a few drinks I quickly realized what I loved most was the central location of the hotel and how nice it is to be able to stumbled to the room without a cab or long walk to the other side of the strip! Overall I would highly recommend this Resort and Casino for its exceptional staff, room cleanliness, location and low rates.
Robert at the front desk is AWESOME!!! He helped us upgrade to an amazing room and we got to check in super early. Very friendly and extremely helpful! Thanks Robert!!
This review is for the blackjack tables only.  For those of you that do not know, when you get blackjack you should be paid 1 1/2 times your wager.  Planet Hollywood's tables pay 6:5 which is barely exceeds what you bet.  So when they say "blackjack" don't get excited here because it means nothing .  You are playing 21, not blackjack...  Don't waste your $ here. Find a place where your $ lasts longer and when they yell "blackjack" it means something!!!. . I do love the  vibe here and staff is always great... Just bad "21" rules
Stayed at The Planet Hollywood Resort in the beginning of July and it was a great stay. I got a deal which included $25.00 dollars a day for a food and beverage credit, which came in handy for room service.. . Valet is a must! So easy and friendly staff.. . I would have given it 4 stars but we got there a little earlier than expected and asked for an early check in about 6:30 am. The clerk told us that if I checked in now I would be charged for a whole night stay and to come back at 9, I found him to be VERY rude. So we walked around the hotel but realized we were just too exhausted. We waited for an hour in the lobby and saw people going up to what looked like a check in, but we decided to still wait. 8 came around and my boyfriend was asleep on my lap so decided I couldn't wait any longer and I went up asked another lady if we can check and and she checked us in with ease, for a fee, which was fine with me. She also said early check in starts at 6.... UGH!Checkout line was VERY long just for them to say, "okay you're good.". . The room was great, Adams Family theme, HUGE bed and very comfy. Plenty of space to hang your clothes and drawers to fold other clothes. The bathroom had its own private bathroom, which I loved and separate tub and shower. We were close to the elevator and the room was very quiet and dark. . . The pool was cool 21 and up, its not a pool party like other resorts but it's still fun if you're a little too hungover to catch a cab and go to a pool party. I did see a couple girls flash their boobs and then get kicked out, very funny. . . The resort has a mall connected to it and you can get very lost! But it has all your needs while staying cool. . . If I were to be going on a long stay and a romantic one to boot, I would be choosing this hotel for sure.
Love the location. It's right in the middle of the las vegas strip. The rooms are ok. Love the Hollywood theme idea in all rooms. . . *Planet hollywood does have a Starbucks.. *love the mall (some stores not expensive). *YOLO'S restaurant great place to eat dinner. (Mexican food). . *three stars for customer service  PH checkout tho. Needs improvement.
Great location and room was super affordable. Even more affordable when I pulled the $20 trick and got a sick upgrade to a resort suite with a view of the strip.. . The bathrooms need serious upgrading. Was contemplating if I should wear flip flops in the shower. Room was nice, a bit flawed in comparison to website pictures. Yes, the TV is in a weird spot. Had to flip around on the bed and watch at an angle. They need to put an adjustable mount on the TVs. Pool area needs some work too.. . PH is probably one of my favorite casinos. Good crowd with plenty of $10 and $15 blackjack tables.. . Love the convenience of the Miracle Mile shops. The Halo Bar has a great happy hour from 12-7 with $5 patron shots.. . Would stay here again when on a budget.
So another year and the same shit.  You can't valet here unless you are staying.  It's a Sunday night during off season and there are several valets just hanging around. Not even the ultra high end Cosmopolitan shoos away their gamblers and eaters !! Hate it and I will never stay here because of it!
Cool hotel, efficient check in process. Remember to ask for a fridge if you need one, and we didn't have a little coffee maker.
Not even when it was the Aladdin casino, we rarely came here for the casino. (You can tell when it's crowded when you have a hard time finding parking in the multi-level parking garage. As always with the Strip and Las Vegas, Free Parking.) The best thing about this casino is the Miracle Mile shops: Ben & Jerry's, Todai, Blondie's, Lobster ME, Auntie Anne's, Cheeseburger. Yes, we've tried all those places. Some of the stores are: Ann Taylor LOFT, Gap, Bath & Body Works, The Body Shop, Sephora, Urban Outfitters, Crocs, H & M, The Walking Company, ABC stores, Tommy Bahama.  And you guessed it, we've been to all these stores, too. The directory is pretty vast. I'm sure I'd run out of letters if I listed them all. (Gone are the days when Hilo Hattie once had a store here.) There is also a couple showrooms (one is used for "So You Think You Can Dance" Vegas Week- we just happened to come here this past weekend to try Lobster Me (delicious, check out my review on it) and I saw Tyce Diorio and Lil' C- I should've asked to snap a pictured with these guys). We enjoy coming here when we want to walk around inside a shopping center especially if the weather is bad outside or if we've had a big meal. There's always a good crowd here, because there are lots of stores and restaurants here. . . Also in the casino are PF Chang's and Pink's (famous hot dog place in LA). This used to be the Aladdin, and the ownership changed, thus, so did the theme. My husband says that too many casinos are going "Yuppie." As for the rest of the casino, I can't really comment on it, since we go straight into Miracle Mile.
Whenever we are in Vegas, even staying at a different hotel, we ALWAYS end up spending a lot of time here. The mall has great shops, my lucky slot machine is here, and Blondie's shows all of our sports games, no matter what time in the morning they are on tv.. . I met my husband in the Heart Bar, so I also have some sentimental attachment. . . Another thing - BRITNEY SPEARS! . . 'Nuff said.
Would've been more because they have my all time fave drink spot FAT TUESDAY, Pink's, a mall and it's a nice hotel but I have to take a star for whatever was inthe bed with me that bit me on my big toe, pinky toe and arm. I'm hoping it was just a friendly chocolate loving spider but yeah. I let the birthday girl choose which bed she wanted and somehow I ended up with Charlotte. Thanks. No, but otherwise I enjoyed our stay, it had a nice big bathroom and the staff was very friendly.
Stay in the suite, but avoid the standard rooms! My experience in the panoramic suite was amazing (1300 sq foot room) but the standard hollywood hip rooms are located in the older tower (back from the Aladdin Casino days) and they are super out of date and run down. That was my first experience with PH.. . I was hesitant to stay at PH again, but I got a comp room from my total rewards card...so why not...and im glad i did! I got the upgraded suite because I tipped the front desk clerk $100 when I checked in. And it was well worth it...the suite was a James Bond 007 theme with tons of memorabilia and couches, hot tubs, 2 bathrooms, and bidets lol! From my room I had views of the Bellagio, Aria, Cosmo, Paris, etc....simply amazing!. . The Pleasure Pit has a nightclub atmosphere with really cute girls, go-go dancers, and "club" music. Even if you lose, at least the dealer who is collecting your money isn't an eyesore lol. Limits are fair at PH (low to mid range) but it's one of my favorite casinos to play in. Crowd tends to be a bit younger then other places as well.. . Location is top notch...you're minutes away from the Cosmo and Paris and Bellagio. Other amentities include Miracle Mile Mall...so lots of affordable eats...in addition to the places in the mall, theres also an Earls and Pink's Hot Dogs.  . . My only gripes? Higher then average room prices when compared to similar tier hotels, a very confusing casino floor (i always get lost), no nightclub, and a tiny sports book (I always go over to the bellagio to watch). OHHH and if you park in the SELF PARK garage...be prepared for a long walk through the mall and everything, so if you don't want your family to be mad at you...VALET YOUR CAR! lol
I think I love this hotel and if I had to pick one, this would be one of my preferred hotels on the strip. . . First, the miracle mile shops are downstairs and you can literally lose yourself for hours if you have nothin better to do. Second, the location is right in the middle of all the action. You can walk across to some of the other hotels, visit Walgreens, eat a Pink's hot dog, get a tattoo, all within a few blocks from this hotel. There is also Gordon Ramsey's restaurant downstairs and Britney Spears is performing here... Yes, there's also a club here. One more thing is that the standard rooms come with a deep soaking tub and the decor in each room has posters and props from Hollywood movies. No fridge or microwave though and my only gripe is that the gaming options are definitely overpriced so I would suggest taking a walk to one of the "Cheaper" casino's but I guess that's what this "deluxe" hotel can afford to do. Another grip is the Pleasure Pit. If I am going to gamble, I do not want to be distracted by these half naked women with their hoo-ha's hanging out dancing on tables near the gaming. If you're there for that type of attraction, go to a strip club or walk the strip, you will see plenty, lol. Other than that, 4 stars for location, glitz, convenience, glamor, etc. . . I recently purchased a suite across the street from the Planet Hollywood right next to the Cosmopolitan so if anyone needs a suite in a great location and doesn't want to pay Planet Hollywood prices, HOLLER!! lol
Exatreamly disappointed with this hotel. I have been to Vegas numerous times and have never had to change our hotel because the cleanliness was so bad. Tub and shower still had hair from the last people who stayed. Glass tables had "white powder" residue still on them. Glasses were not cleaned and had film in them also tags from shopping on the floor. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't cleaned the sheets and just make the beds at this point ... So gross ended up moving to the Elaera Hilton Gand vacation suites.
Planet Hollywood is located on central of the strip. It's same spot from Aladdin Las Vegas.. . Planet Hollywood is designed to make ordinary people feel like stars and the hotel rooms are no exception. . . Be honest, I found the restaurants in PH are more causal and affordable than other hotels.
Love, love, love Planet Hollywood! The staff is super nice and I love the ultra modern vibe of the hotel and casino. The rooms are a little older than some of the other hotels on the strip, but it is very clean. The cleaning people were amazing and super accommodating! It has such a modern yet comfortable feel. . . Of all the casinos I went into, theirs was probably my favorite as well. It just has a fun vibe to it, nothing too pretentious or gaudy, but you can still tell you are in Vegas.  .  . The location is right in the middle of the strip and right across from the Bellagio fountains. If you arelooking for a fun hotel that is modern chic, Planet Hollywood is your hotel!!!! . . The mall attached to it is really fun too. There are so many shops to explore.
I would rate this hotel in Las Vegas as just average. Checking in is ridiculous, rooms are just ok bordering on really old and not super clean. We stayed for two days and it was very eventful. They tried to check us out a day early which resulted in another trip to the lobby, not fun. The fire alarms where going off and nobody there seemed to mind which lead me to believe this happens a lot (false alarm). The worst is the parking, if you plan on driving do not stay here unless you love long walks through a mall with your luggage.. . Restaurants are fairly good and casino is ok.
My favorite casino on the strip!. . So many things to do inside of there!. . Gambling, shows, huge mall, many restaurants to choose from, and Best buffet in the world (spice market) can you say unlimited crab legs :). . Employees are nice, bathrooms are nice, and even the outside of it is amazing.. . Recommend staying here or at least visit this place, just don't get lost lol
I stayed at Planet Hollywood in Vegas for my 26th birthday and I had an amazing stay. The rooms were amazingly affordable. We even upgraded for $20/ night for a room with a view, and we were very happy that we did. We stayed on the 50thfloor of the 51 floor building. The view was outstanding, you could see the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio water show, and an amazing view of the strip.The accommodations were nice and clean and very comfortable. . . It's so nice having a mall underneath you. On the first day I stopped to get my hair done immediately after checking in, because unfortunately the one thing I had forgot to pack was my hair straightener and I wanted to look good for a night on the town. Luckily there was a salon in the mall. It was so convenient having what I needed right downstairs.. . Another plus is that it's in a good location from everything else on the strip. Everything's in pretty much walking distance.. . My only complaint is no free wifi for guests, but you can always stop downstairs at the Starbucks for it if you like.. . I will have to say that I had a great experience for my first time in Las Vegas thanks in part to my stay at the Planet Hollywood.
Given the room we were in I think 3 stars is about right, had we been in a better updated room then I could imagine it being 4.. . The rooms were ok, nothing special but they were a place to sleep which is really all we wanted for our 2 night stay. My Husband booked 2 rooms via his Perks subscription for us and his Family to stay in. The rooms were on the small side and really dark inside, they really had seen better days too. Paint was chipped and housekeeping wasn't overly enthusiastic in regards to the dusting but the location was perfect. We were on the 21st floor which has some nice views and was quiet, what I really didn't like was there was only one working Ice Machine for the entire floor, I had to walk right around to the other side of the building in my PJ's twice to fill up a tiny little bucket.. . Britney happened to be performing on the 2nd night that we stayed and thought it nice that they place her pictures up around the elevator area, not so cool when fans are holding up the line to get one while posing and taking pictures though. Maybe have a designated area for this sort of thing?. The casino downstairs is pretty big and there is a great selection of shops and eateries, I LOVED the fact that Gordon Ramsay Burger was in the same building. The Miracle Mile shops is also a huge bonus too.. . Check in was easy once we got through the 30 minute wait in line.
I stayed here over Labor Day Weekend. The price was very reasonable, but I was not happy with the room at all.  My friend and I checked in after we got back from the Dayclub around 6pm, so there should be no reason why the room would be dirty because housekeeping should of tidied up the place hours ago. When we walked in we were greeted by hot cheetos on the floor... and some trash leftover from the party from last night. OVERALL, I WAS NOT A HAPPY CAMPER !
so far my favorite place to stay on the strip. Check in quick, service great (even when I locked myself out of my room) and plenty do in the vicinity. I hate walking all up and down Las Vegas Boulevard  so I like the location of PH because it's close to city center and has plenty of shopping. The room was fairly updated and really clean, Restaurants are all good too and great for casual dining. Try Burgr and Koi.. The minus one star is for the pool. I was really surprised that Bally's had a better pool area. There weren't a lot of chairs around the pool . There were a lot of cabanas and day beds that looked really faded and worn, and no one was really using them so it seemed like a waste.
