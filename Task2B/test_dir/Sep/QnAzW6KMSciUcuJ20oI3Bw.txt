I wanted to love this place, but it was just OK in my opinion.. . The restaurant itself is pretty cool, lots of outside seating and room for kids to run around. . . The food, I felt was OK... better than the majority of fast food places, but nothing over the top or begging me to come back tomorrow.. . Two things that sort of bothered me, were the FLIES, ugh, everywhere, even inside, AND - all of the drinks and condiments were located outside, which might not necessarily be a bad thing, was just weird to me. Oh, and the ranch.. was... weird, like runny? And the taste was.. different. I'll admit I am kind of a ranch snob, so it wasn't HORRIBLE, just weird. I feel like if you're gonna gloat about your fabulous onion rings, you should pair it with some decent ranch.
Yes, Joes Farm Grill in Gilbert, AZ is a modern and trendy burger joint. The ambiance is very cool and many people come here regularly. But, it's called Joes FARM grill, so get something that's grown on the Agrotopia farm.  It's super fresh and tasty.  I recommend the Thai chicken salad, Beet salad, Farm salad or BBQ chicken salad.  All have fresh vegetables straight from the farm.. . Admittedly, the burgers are good, especially the Fontina burger. Yum. Add fresh homemade onion rings and garlic fries and you can be in that naughty little zone of eating fast food that you know isn't really healthy while at the same time justifying it by  having a salad too!  After all, it's fresh from the farm!. . The pizza is great too.  Overall, it's a really fun place to go to lunch and reasonably priced.
Best place ever , food , helpful staff , .sit in side or out. . Outside sitting you have the trees over flowing, so shade areas all around.walking distance to the Farm Stand and Agritopia..plenty of parking walk all around take in the sites.We have veggie burger with sweet potato fries, /ahi tuna salad with cole slaw. Both amazing  veggie burger is so big , never can finish it , and the tuna is cooked to prefection with just the right amount of pink showing,with wasbi dressing just a hint of hotnees , season to let you know its there but not over powering
Sooo yummy and fresh.  I had Ahi Tuna Sandwich and my hubby had their double dog basket.  It was our first time thereso in case it's yours too there is 3 things to remember.  1) Soft drink fountain is out side. . 2) There is only one bathroom and it's women & men.  I thought it was strange but hey it's funny to experience new things.  . 3) It's a big portion.  Next time we are totally sharing one....unless I'm really hungry/heehee.
Wow this place knocked my socks off. The food is unbelievable... Especially the sweet potato pie, the milk shakes and the ahi tuna sandwhich. I love seeing how the staff pulled together and worked as a team during busy times. You can really see the time, energy and love that is put into each plate which truly makes this a destination spot.
A gilbert gem! This place has awesome customer service, ambiance, and food. The sweet potato fires, onion rkngs, milkshakes, fontina burger, and BBQ chicken pizza are my favorites on the menu.. . Make sure to visit on your birthday for 10 off your meal!
One of my favorite places! Breakfast is awesome. They have really good pancakes and waffles. Lunches are also great. I love the fontina burger. The garlic fries are yum. The beet salad is tasty. The panko onion rings are crunchy and flavorful. It is a great place to eat outdoors during the spring and fall, and on cooler early mornings in the summer. The price is worth it when you consider the obvious quality of what you are getting on your plate. My only complaint is that the quality of their beverages (Coke products...blech) and their condiments (specifically the mayo and ranch dressing) don't match the quality of their food.
I was hesitant about coming here. I just wanted a margarita and some sub-par food to absorb the tequila. Finding out that I was being taken to some fast-casual burger place without alcohol was slightly disappointing to me. I sucked it up and went on Yelp to see what's good here, and imagine my surprise to see over 700 reviews with an average of 4 stars. Suddenly, the afternoon started to look up.. . Based on Yelp reviews, I ordered the Fontina Burger with garlic fries, my friends ordered The Farm Burger and BBQ Bleu Cheese Pizza, and together we shared the Butter Pecan Shake.. . The first bite of my burger made me forget all about cool refreshing margarita waiting for me at some hole in the wall Mexican restaurant. My burger was better than alcohol --- fuck that noise. This is clearly going to earn my five stars.. . After I embarrassed my friends by moaning out loud while eating my burger I was actually stoked about my garlic fries. Imagine my surprise to find out that I hated them. I hated the garlic fries. I love garlic, I love fries, but I HATED these garlic fries. Actually, I hated them so much I forgot how much I loved my burger. They were just so pungent and strong and overwhelming. I was eating raw garlic on soggy, oily fries. Eck, just remembering it makes me queasy. . . I had a five star burger and a 1 star side of fries, that unfortunately averages out to 3 stars. However, my friends raved about their food so I'm bumping up to four and calling it a night. A good margarita will surely erase the taste of garlic fries from my person.
Flies EVERYWHERE! Great food but it's ruined the instant you get it because there are flies CONSTANTLY landing on your food. They have a serious fly problem. My advice is get it to go because the food is worth it.
Free meal on your birthday!  Food is amazing, atmosphere is fun, 5 stars easy...
Very good food and nice grounds.  Had BBQ. Bacon burger and it was a 10.  Onion rings and sweet potato fries good too.  Definitely will be back.
This place never ceases to please the taste palette. Even though the drive may be far, my wife and I try to come here at least once a month.. . She gets the Ahi tuna sandwich. The crunchiness of the coleslaw salad adds a refreshing taste to the already fresh tuna, which is grilled to perfection.. . I get the bbq chicken pizza. Their homemade bbq sauce compliments the grilled flat bread and farm fresh chicken.. . Everything is good here.
Must have come on a bad day. My wife got the grilled wedge salad. It was not grilled, they forgot the bacon and left the lettuce core on it.  Burgers were ok not great. A bit overcooked. 2.50 for onion ring upgrade and you get four rings. They really need to do something about the flies, there were thousands.  Lots of swatting going on. Saw a maggot on our table, not surprising.  At least we can say we tried it. Too 'back to nature' for me.
Always come here when I am in town. Great spot for fresh and consistent food. Worth the loooooong drive the Gilbert. Love the Ahi Tina sandwich, burgers, BBQ pork and salads ....all good. The only downside is that it so popular it is always crowded and they don't really engage you as a customer.  Everyone that works there is behind a big wall of glass and the only people waking around are bus boys. They would do  to engage customers a bit more to warm up the place. If you lower your expectations for warmth of service, you won't be disappointed.
This place is really fun and different. The food is a little pricey for what you get, in my opinion, but it tastes sooooo good. The pesto burger rocks, garlic fries, and the BBQ chicken pizza, are also good. Your timing needs to be good, because the place can get packed quickly, with lines out the door. The wrong time of year, and the indoor seats are noisy and cramped, and the outdoor seats are abuzz with flies.
I would visit this place for the bathrooms alone. I won't spoil it if you've never been. This is a casual joint that's always packed. The food is great. We enjoy the seasonal milkshakes, the Ahi and Portobello sandwiches and the Fontina burger. The garlic fries are just ...eh. The rings and zucchini are good. . That all being said, I don't like eating here in the summer. The outdoor condiments get warm and the place gets infested...I mean INFESTED with flies. Like "I can't eat here. Can I get this to go instead?" Flies.
Fantastic. Did not disappoint. I have never ever ever had a bad meal here. My personal favorite is the mahi mahi sandwich. They just do it right and it's not easy getting good fish in Arizona.
