I've stayed at the Luxor a couple of times. I don't hate it, I don't love it. I love T&T (Tacos and Tequila). Best happy hour during the week. Delicious and easy on your wallet. The Pyramid Cafe is also good, but only open until 1PM weekdays and 2PM on weekends. What I don't like is the internet here. It's WIRED!  You could trip over the cord in your room if you are not careful. They need to get with the times and get wireless internet. They let you book comps on the weekends and it's pretty easy to get a room, even on busy weekends. They are our last resort hotel, but it's not a bad choice. It could be cleaner, but I've rarely stayed at a hotel that actually looks/feels super clean. I always sense some old smoke residue lingering in the halls and room.  Not the worst place to stay, but in a pinch it will do.
I booked a package deal and selected Luxor since it was one of the lowest priced deals. Since i had never stayed there,  I thought I'd give it a try.  Check in was fairly easy. They don't seem so friendly with the guests but that part was alright. My non-smoking room on the 19th floor smelled like a mild cigar. The bathroom and beds seemed really clean.  I actually only have two things that were deal breakers for me: . . 1) it's a bit too far from the middle of the strip so it isn't the most convenient if you like to go down to the Miracle Mall shops and Bellagio/Ceasar's Palace. Very limited places to eat (with any decent reviews) without having a walk a ways,  . . 2) The air conditioner had a problem during the day keeping it cool in the room due to the glass windows. It seemed the room was probably about 80 degrees inside. I must say it was 100 degrees outside but I need a more comfortable room when it comes to AC.  The room seemed to get somewhat comfortable around 3am.. . They do have the Titanic exhibit at the Luxor.  I don't plan to go back to the Luxor.
I had an amazing weekend here for my cousin wedding. I love this hotel and plan to stay here again.
We just got home from a 2 night, 3 day stay at the Luxor. Hubby and I wanted a vacation before we have our baby in February. I saw an all-inclusive package with Luxor that included tickets to Criss Angel, and I was sold since I've wanted to go see that show for ages.. . Check-In: Was pretty speedy. The line was long but it moved fast, which was nice after a 5 hour drive. Overall it was all very pleasant. The clerk answered all my questions about the all-inclusive pacakage and directed me where I needed to be to get everything squared away.. . Room: On the advice of friends, we booked a Tower room. I had heard that these rooms are more modern and have a bathtub, the pyramid rooms don't and are older. I was thrilled with the room. It was spacious. The bed was super comfortable. The bathroom was huge, with a big bathtub. Except that the room doesn't have Wi-Fi, or really any internet access that I could find at all. If you want to use the Internet you have to use one of their public terminals down on the casino floor, where anyone could look over your shoulder. That was really annoying and outdated.. . Buffet: Part of our package was all-day passes to the Luxor buffet and the Excalibur buffet. Here is where it started going downhill. I was informed that the Excalibur buffet is closed for remodeling, so we can only use the Luxor buffet. Okay, they should have changed that on their offer page, but whatever.. . Shows: Here is where I really started to get angry. Apparently, Criss Angel was on vacation for the whole week....so no Criss Angel show. So, why exactly did no one call me and let me know that? Or, I don't know, sync the show page with the booking page to SHOW ME that there was no Criss Angel shows that week? Hello, this is ridiculous, that was the whole reason I booked the package to begin with! They said they would "try" and get me tickets to something else instead. Oh no dear, I'm getting tickets to a show. We got tickets to Jabbawockeez instead. And I was irritated further when everyone insisted on telling me "It's really a better show than Criss Angel anyway." Shut up, seriously. I paid because I wanted to see Criss Angel, just say you're sorry it wasn't handled better and move on. The Jabbawockeez show was really good, I enjoyed it. It was fun, energetic, and really was worth the time and hassle.. . Titanic: This exhibit was pretty good, it wasn't as great as I expected but it was fun. I don't think I'd go again but didn't regret the time spent.. . Bodies: This was fantastic, the highlight of the trip for sure. It was absolutely fascinating and I would go back on a return trip for sure.. . Spa: Part of my all-inclusive package was a "day pass" to the spa. No one could tell me what that actually meant, so I had to walk over to the spa and asked. It was a pass to use the sauna and whirlpool tub for the day. Well, that's great but I can't do that because I'm pregnant. If someone had told me before what the day pass actually was I'd have booked a spa service separately, but instead they were all booked. . . Timeshare people: I have never in my life been more harassed than when I stayed here. We would literally have to dodge 3 groups of timeshare hockers just on the way to the buffet! Yeah I don't want to sit in a meeting for your timeshares for 2 hours just to get cheap tickets to a show. And they will follow you and hound you with questions. We visited a few other casinos on our trip and didn't get bothered at all, or very rarely. But at Luxor it was constant.. . Complaint handling: Needless to say, after the buffet trouble, the spa trouble, and the Criss Angel show trouble I was not happy and asked to speak to a manager. According to her, the Criss Angel show was cancelled the day we arrived due to an emergency....okay then why does the show page show the show being out for the whole week then? Not just starting the day before? Management tip #1: Don't lie to make your customers feel less ripped off. Then she again repeated that the Jabbawockeez show was so much better anyway that we really got lucky. Yeah, great, except we didn't want to see the Jabbawockeez show! We wanted to see the Criss Angel show! Then she offered to comp us the "resort" fee of $45, so about 10% of the overall price of the package. I thought that was a pretty pathetic attempt to appease us. Every problem we had was because THEY failed to communicate, yet they seemed to feel no need to make that right.. . Bottom line, we will not stay at Luxor again. They can't even update their offer page when unexpected things happen. They can't give customers accurate information on check in (no one told us about any changes to the package we'd originally booked). And then their attempts to make their mistakes right were pathetic. Next time we'll stay somewhere else and buy the Criss Angel tickets when we arrive.
We had a great time at this place! Our room was spectacular, it had a built in hot tub with a view of the strip. The buffet was awesome. The staff was great, the parking convenient. The casino and amenities were great. We loved the whole pyramid theme, it was a lot of fun. There might be better on the strip, but for the value this place was fun and overall the pros far outweighed any cons. . . There were no major problems. The only minor issue was that there was a bit of a line to check-in, but it moved quickly and the wait wasn't horrible. There were minor things here and there that could have been cleaned sooner or used upgrades, but when dealing with a major hotel and casino resort that does as much turnover as this place does as well as handling as many drunken college kids as it does, I'd say this place does pretty well. . . Great value on the strip, a lot of fun and great rooms add up to five stars for me.
I recently stopped by the Luxor to watch the Jabbawockeez show. It's the one pyramid hotel with the light shooting up. It's the south part of the strip next to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. There is a free tram to get to the 3 different hotels since the 3 hotels are all part of the same branch. There's a huge sphinx you can take a picture of when you're waiting for the tram. . . The casino is pretty old and you can tell it is old. There are a lot of workers who approach you for "free tickets."  We asked a worker to direct us to the box office and he did, then started to persuade us for who knows what. I think it's some time share or presentation. Regardless, we got approaches by them ALL over the casino. It got really annoying. . . Games were average. It's all personal preference. I won't be staying here anytime, probably ever.  It's far from the other hotels and casinos I do like.
My wife and I came to Luxor to watch Jabbawockeez. It's been a while since I've been here. When we first got there, we didn't know where the box office was so we asked a worker for help. He told is where it was then tried to sucker us into a timeshare meeting. We already knew about those people that try to get you to do a meeting to get free or discounted show tickets. So we were prepared to say no. It started to become a habit each time we walked by those timeshare workers. They would always bother you asking if you wanted discounted show tickets. It happened multiple times while we were there. This was really annoying as they are waiting in the walkways to prey on the people who don't know. This is something that will probably make me not come back here. . . The casino itself is ok. Nothing really exciting about this place. It feels nostalgic being there since I remember coming when I was a kid to ride the rides and watch the shows. It doesn't seem like they've upgraded this place and it's stuck in the past. I give this place 2 stars due to the annoying timeshare people that harass you nonstop!
Got a great package deal on price line to stay at The Luxor for three nights. We arrived about 5 hours before check in and planned on dropping our bags off at the front desk and to then hit the town. When we got to the check in desk we were told the hotel were doing early check ins as a courtesy! As we walked through the casino someone approached us asking if we were single and if they could give us a voucher. Neither one of us (my friend and I) are, so we said no thanks and went on our way. We stayed on floor 20 and the elevator may make you somewhat uneasy since its going up sideways because of the pyramid shape of the hotel.  Our room was spacious with a lovely view of the pool and the mountains. We had a shower with absolutely no shelving for our bath products, which was a hassle. There was no mini fridge, coffee pot, or microwave. . . The view from the hallway was of the mezzanine, which was pretty cool. There are endless slushie stops, a food court, and a few restaurants inside the hotel. Oh, and three Starbucks! There are a few 24 hour convenient shops that will attempt to rob you blind charging $11 for a bottle of Advil. I would recommend stopping by one of the Walgreen's on the strip if you're needing anything like that.. . My friend and I were harassed every time we attempted to pass through the hotel. I'm not sure who these people even work for but they're wearing suits and they stand at different parts of the hotel (mainly around the casino) and attack any innocent passerby with, "Where are you ladies from?" "Are you ladies single?" By the end of the trip we had been approached by so many of these people I was just looking at them and shaking my head no as soon as they would open their mouths.. . The pool closes as 7:00 pm which is a huge bummer, since we were usually out on the strip later than that. The pool was relatively small with some chained off areas which I'm assuming are for private parties. We only made it to the pool once and for 30 minutes.. . Overall it was a pleasant experience, but I most likely wouldn't stay here again because of the location. It is at the end of the strip, so walking anywhere takes quite a while.
Luxor ruined my vacation. I forgot my favorite dress and blue scarf (one of a kind) in the closet of my hotel room upon checkout. The clothing wasn't expensive but it definitely had a lot of sentimental value and the two items definitely were chic. Since I realized it was gone, the evening after I left, I've been trying to get it back, calling multiple times a day, with no success. I'm certain one of the staff stole it, as the next guest was asked about it and did not see it. It was not reported in lost and found and the bureaucracy of the luxor prevents me from accomplishing anything productive. I even stayed at the luxor a few days later and they wouldn't let me look at the lost and found nor at their database.  If you DO stay here, don't forget anything or else you'll be sorry. Looks like theft among their cleaning staff is pretty regular, and easy.. The system protects criminal behavior after all. Thanks for ruining my vacation, Luxor.
stay away from this place. we got in to vegas at 1 am and had the worst experience from the start. the person checking us in at the desk was extremely rude. I spoke to the manage and he was a complete idiot. I had pain for 2 nights on vegas.com and they would not reimburse me for the second night, so I ended up losing 1 night and booked at the PLAZZO instead. WOW what a difference, from customer service to casino atmosphere.. do yourself a favor and stay away from this shit hole. also, try to book through the hotel itself as vegas.com does not refund if there is any issues.
No Wifi. Cash only for most of the hotel services, such as room service.. Pool closes at 7pm. Need I say more???. Avoid this place, and it's connected resorts. Unless you have Motel 6 expectations.
Wow was this trip an eye opener. BEWARE of GrandView working as a promotional third party company looking to take advantage of you in order to get you to take a tour of their timeshares. We were approached as soon as we entered Luxor by a gentleman named Noel who basically led us over to this counter in the middle of the lobby. NOTE they wear the exact same uniform as the staff who actually works for the hotel. There was no sign on the counter or anywhere to suggest there was a third party involved. We believed we were being greeted and led to a counter to be checked in. Rico behind the desk, basically offered us what we heard as free shows that got turned into requirements that weren't fully disclosed such as paying $50 and going to a 5 hour time share meeting with only their transportation etc. We were scammed. Sherri was the only kind one. I assumed she was the manager. We were told to go to another counter to get our refund cause her booth had no cash. Once we got to that booth, one gentleman tried to shoo us away. In the end we got our money back. . . Now regarding the hotel. The resort fee is ridiculous especially when you bring your computer and WiFi is supposed to be included and yet you need a cable connection and they do not provide cables at all. They charge $22-$23 dollars per night "at your convenience" for amenities that you may never use. The pool is very small and nothing special. If you want a good chair and the jacuzzi you're going to have to pay $50 for the day. My advice, stay somewhere you're not pressured for your buck.
I just had the chance to spend a day at Luxor.  and it was a So-So experience.  I didn't stay over night so i cant say much about the hotel part but I'll share my overall experience of the casino.. . The gaming floor is a little small. You can walk around the place in like 5 minutes...Maybe a good thing? The first machine i played was some electronic craps. Played a minimum wager bet and a Field bet. Hit double 6's and the machine broke LOL... I had to call a slot attendant over to fix it and they voided my win... Not expected but rules are the rules i guess.. . The entire staff of Luxor looked like they were miserable and that doesn't really put me in the mood to lay down some real bets. The electronic Black Jack is pretty fun but don't count the house letting you win more than $115 there. Roulette was also a blast. Great odd's and it seems like the most legit electronic machine on the casino floor. I didn't come to win...so anyways... . And a yes, what all those other Yelpers say about the people heckling you to buy Time Shares is 100% true. Every time we left and re-entered luxor, we were hassled by oriental women who barley spoke a lick of English about Free this and that. That right there is what dropped my review from 4 stars to 3.. . Enough of the bad stuff, so they have not 1 but 2 Starbucks!!! Oh and they have a 24/hr Krispy Kreme!! Two of the 3 reasons why I came! They are linked to the Excalibur and Mandalay bay and supposedly they have a Tram that goes back and fourth. The Buffet was pretty decent. The Go-Go dancer that was half naked was different... It looked like she was out of place and didn't really go well with the casino... Not a reason to come back...i would go to Pink Flamingo for that... And lastly, the SKY LIGHT WAS NOT ON!!! I wanted a to see that but i guess they are saving on the electric bill..... . But yea, i was planning on coming back in November but I really don't think i will be returning.. . . A side note to Luxor - GET RID OF THE TIME SHARE SALES PEOPLE!! One of my biggest reasons why i might not be returning.  Give the staff a pay raise or some free Red Bull because they look like they need it.
I just got back from a convention at the Luxor and although I haven't been in Las Vegas in 15 years it was definitely a nice place to stay with easy access to other strip properties and the airport. Only a $15 cab ride to the airport and $23 to Fremont Street it has easy access and inside walk ways to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. The pool is large but no diving due to the deepest part only being 3.5 feet was a let down for me. The best bargain for food is their Deli which is open 24 hours and has great food for breakfast, lunch and dinner if you like casual dining. $6-14 on average plus drinks. The sports book is bigger than many other strip casinos and plenty of table games and slots. Plenty of bars and a nightclub, be sure you wear long pants, collared shirts and dress shoes though. And since they are part of the MGM chain they participate in the MLife awards program but if you play at one casino and get a voucher you can't use it at another casino even if it's in their catalog. I'd go back here if I didn't go to The Golden Nugget, which is much less expensive for everything. We paid $20 to check in early and a few bucks to have the bellmen hold our bags after we checked out. Got a let check out for no extra fee too. The dealers were helpful in teaching us how to play certain games and the sportsbook guys were good at explaining the different wagers. Overall a very good experience. The convention hall was nice and well air conditioned even though it was 100 degrees outside.
Stayed here with my wife and when we arrived they didn't have our king room avail. So we got upgraded to a suite with a king bed. The customer service was amazing. All the amenities you could ask for, razor flat iron etc.!!! My wife forgot her purse in the car & concierge went to the car & brought her purse to her! They also gave us a round of drinks and $20 free play upon arrival. I cannot express the customer service. Best I have ever experienced!!! . . . . Stayed September 2014, traveled with friends
Horrible place. Staff was unfriendly. Room was stinking. Bad deal and a horrible hotel.
Its the WORST Hotel&Casino we've ever been!! Just don't go there !!! The staff is very rude, casino rip everybody off , you pay for everyday 23$ for pool and other services BUT where's the service??? Pool is overfilled and there where space is, you have to pay extra !!! For a 10 OZ coke you pay $6 +tax and the Exhibitions sucks!! In casinos is it too freezy and if you stay longer  than 2 nights (dont do that) you get a cold because its as cold as a freezer!!! Only good thing is: 2 of 25 housekeepers are friendly! It doesnt worth! I recommend: go in the most fucked up motel you find - its much better than Luxor !!!!!!!!!
My husband and I were married at their chapel location. The staff has always been helpful and attentive. We have always  been able to check in as soon as we arrived even if it was before 3:00pm. Rooms have always been nice, clean and quiet. I always love visiting this hotel,
Did you already book?? Okay , you already lost! If you wanna leave without your pants, just go to luxor!!!! Omg everyone i know, is the same meaning! . If you wanna win money and pay normally prices, go to Primm!!! Buffalo bill :-)
I don't really know what people do here. . It's not a bad place if you have kids that like the fact that it's a pyramid,. But it's problematic how it's across the street from anything.. There's a titanic exhibit. But that's about it in terms of tourism appeal.
I have stayed at the LUXOR numerous times.  Great experiences all around.  Having stayed in a double queen bed room in the Pyramid once (kinda cool to do one time), I now prefer the newer and a bit more spacious rooms you will find in the Tower.. . The food court is great for breakfast at reasonable prices and done fairly quickly. If you're on a meal break here at the LUXOR in the Business Center, you know what an issue it can be to get a quick meal anywhere on the LV Strip. . . Cool Note:. The lines at the 2 Starbucks (they don't accept Starbucks Gift Cards, fyi.) can get long in the morning Coffee Commute hours.  Venture upstairs to the food court and you can get a better coffee at McD's in half the time and at a better price!
I had never stayed at the luxor but even as a kid always wondered how it would be to stay at the pyramid, and I gotta tell you it was great. The service was very good from the staff and room service, when we checked in we were upgraded to a bigger room than the one  I booked at no cost. The rooms were clean and very  nice looking reminded me of the Egyptian theme at each glance. Overall I would definitely stay here again I really enjoyed the hotel onely downfall is it's a bit far from the strip
Came here for a few days on a last-minute trip to Vegas. My buddy is a pilot, so I scored some inexpensive First Class airfare and made my way to Sin City. I have always been curious/fascinated with the giant Pyramid on the Strip, so I figured, why not, I'll give this place a try.. . Pros: . -------. . * Live piano players in the lobby. That's awesome. As a professional piano player myself, I have great respect for establishments which employ piano players. Go Luxor.. . * The gentleman who was directing those of us checking in where to go. He was friendly, and talked with each guest, so waiting didn't seem so bad. He even remembered me the next few days and said "hello" each time.. . * Being upgraded to a Luxury Suite. That was pretty cool.. . Cons:. --------. * There's no delicate way to say this, so I'm just going to come right out and say it: there were several white, crusty, semenstains on the carpet. If that wasn't gross enough, they were near the window. Eww. Some peoples' kids. I made note of this to the Front Desk, and they said they would create a "work order". Someone came up to look at the stains later on, but then he said he had to go "work on a special project" and someone else would come up. No one else ever came up. The stains were there all 3 nights I stayed. I never walked barefoot on the carpet.. . * Overall friendliness of staff/management was lacking.. . * Neighbors in Suite next to me were extremely loud (2 Brits and 1 Russian) to the point I needed the TV in my living room on 24/7 to cover their voices. Additionally, they smoked in their rooms and in the hallways, which then made the entire wing of rooms smell like smoke. My room reeked like smoke to the point I went out and purchased air sanitizer spray.. . * Time share people. They were everywhere. Such a buzzkill! I don't remember seeing them in any other casino I've stayed at before!. . My thoughts:. -----------------. . Let's focus on the overall friendliness of staff. If you take the time to read other Yelp reviews, you will notice a consistent theme is the poor attitude of staff and management. If multiple people are Yelping about it over an extended period of time, there is probably some validity to their claims. I realize the Luxor is not the Bellagio, or Caesar's Palace, or SLS. It is geared toward a different demographic and clientele. That said, there is absolutely no excuse for poor attitudes on the part of the staff. . . For example, I called housekeeping one morning around 2:00 am because I wanted to make coffee, but I had no coffee cups in my room. When I spoke with a Hispanic gentleman in Housekeeping, he told me to use the glass cups instead. This is a perfect example of poor attitude. No, the guest should not have to use glass cups for coffee (which can break due to the heat, and which are extremely hot when filled with hot coffee). . . So I did use the glass cup, and I burned my fingers. The next day, when I mentioned this to my housekeeper, she apologized profusely and told me I should never had been told that. This incident, in and of itself, is not a game-changer for me, but the bodily-fluid-stained carpet I had, the poor attitude from concierge, the fact I barely slept my 3 nights there because my neighbors were extremely loud, the constant smoking by my neighbors, the lack of a resolution to the smoking issue - when you combine all of these issues - I had a horrible stay at the Luxor. Tell me - why should I return?. . Back to the issue of great customer service - you don't have to be the most expensive resort on the Strip to give the best customer service. Obviously, when I stay at a 5 star resort (for instance, Pelican Hill in Laguna Beach), I EXPECT top notch service. I expect doors to be opened for me, to be addressed by name, because I am paying for it. But, what if, the employees at the Luxor went above and beyond just because they could?! What if the Luxor became known as the inexpensive resort with 4-5 star customer service? Imagine how the revenue would increase!!. . Let me give you an example - I love food - and one of my favorite restaurants - simply because of their customer service - is Chick-Fil-A. Regardless of whether or not you agree with their ideologies or beliefs is irrelevant. They are a company who exercises extremely amazing customer service, and as a result, they have overtaken KFC in sales. That is a huge feat, as Chick-Fil-A is only open 6 days a week, whereas KFC is open 7 days. Additionally, KFC has been around longer. But I know there is a world of difference in store quality, cleanliness, food quality, and most importantly, customer service between KFC and Chick-Fil-A. So I drive 12 miles each way when I want chicken, even though I have a KFC less than 2 miles away.. . The point is, with simple training, motivation, and a boost to employee morale, Luxor could become the "it" place for great customer service on the strip.
Went to Las Vegas for the first time this past weekend. So much went on, its just easier to do it this way:. . THE GOOD: the bed in the room was comfy (it was a king), the sheets were clean and the pillows were soft. The area in the front entrance was nice looking with the statues and water. The food court was great and we enjoyed the Bodies and Titanic exhibits which I defiantly recommend! The folks at the mLife counter were super helpful!. . THE BAD: everything else! The timeshare creepers who kept stopping us EVERYTIME we walked by even without me making eye contact. Just stop! We were charged a daily fee for "extra amenities" which was to include in-room internet and the use of the pool (which I didn't even use. Why charge me for something that I don't use?!?!). The internet part sucked considering I needed wifi for my iphone so all weekend it was hard to pick up a decent signal. Also there was no coffee pot or mini fridge which can be found in you average Marriott hotel nowadays, but for a luxury hotel on the strip... I guess those were not considered basic needs which caused us to eat at their food court and spend even more money.. . THE UGLY: the elevator was horrible. It was very rickety and caused my husband and I to topple into other people while in there. The back door of our hotel bathroom was covered with dark finger smudges and a few red smears of goodness knows what. I had to wipe the door down before I felt clean enough to use it. Our room towels were really grungy and needed to be replaced. My husband forgot a comb so we called the front desk and they directed us to their 24/7 store where we HAD to buy one at $5. Seriously?!?! Most hotels would give you a little free complimentary one if you forgot yours.. . Overall I will not be returning. I would rather stay at a Motel 6! Don't waste your money!!
I have stayed here a few times, why? Well they always have great deals and its on the strip... but I always forget how much I hate it until I get there. Now I know some people love the novelty of staying in the pyramid, but if you suffer from any kind of vertigo, you are going to hate it. The elevator ride is a memory I will never forget and just thinking about it makes me feel slightly nauseated. And the room with the slant? Yeah no... not that great to stay in for an entire week. The room was clean but there was always constant noise out in the hallway. Not conducive for a sleep environment but the black out drapes are probably the best in Vegas. If I ever stay here again, I will opt for the quieter tower rooms as opposed to the pyramid rooms. I do love the all you can drink buffet during select hours.
I've been to Vegas numerous time and always stayed at the MGM but this year me and my lady decided to stay at the Luxor this year for 5 days and had a great experience all around. the service was great, hotel was nice  and it's family orientated. We love the whole  pyramid look....our only down fall was we book a queen bed but got double beds other then that the experience at the hotel was top tier .....keep up the good work
I Stayed Here For My First Time 9/21-9/23/14. And I Would Have To Say The Reviews Are A Little Harsh. I Used My My Vegas Coins To Cash In On This Room And Got A Good Deal. We Stayed In The Pyramid Double Queen On The 26th Floor And Loved It. The Room Is A Good Size With A Stand Up Glass Shower, Flat Screen TV ( A Good Size Screen To Watch From Your Bed) And Very Comfortable Beds. The Air Works Very Well So Good We Had To Turn It Off Because It Got A Little Too Cold. Housekeeping  Was Really Good When It Came To Making Sure We Had Plenty Of Towels. The Check in Process To A Little Long, But I Think I was Just Antsy To Get In My Room And Head To The Floor For Drinks After That Car Ride. But Give Luxor A Chance! They Even Give You A Coupon Book With Deals, Take The $20 Drink Coupon To FLIGHT Bar And Get Some Good Drinks, Paul The Bartender Is Awesome. Thanks Luxor I Had An Awesome Time! I Will Be Back!
I just spent four nights at the Luxor and I feel like, after reading all the other negative reviews, I have to offer some common sense.. . This is not a great Vegas hotel. It's not the Bellagio or the Venetian. The rooms are in the same general category as a mid-range hotel: think La Quinta. But seriously,for the prices, who can complain considering that I've paid $80-$100 a night for chain hotels along the interstate. This is a solid mid-range or even budget option (I got rates for $42 a night, plus the de rigeur resort fee) if you're looking for a decent place to stay on the Strip.. . The "Pyramid Deluxe" room was clean, had no odor and was quiet. The staff was friendly. What more can you really ask for? I would gladly return here again. . . If only I hadn't blown so much money on the slots it would have been an all around awesome experience, but hey, it's not Vegas if you don't leave just a little ashamed.  ;-)
The wait to check into the room was long, the room was okay and the price was reasonable,  but I wouldn't stay at the Luxor again because of the long check in time after a long flight, the slots stink, no freebies or anything to entice you to come back
First of all I did not receive the room I reserved.  Did get an upgrade to the east tower, rooms remind me of a typical Holiday Express, only more expensive.. Rooms are dark, maybe brighter bulbs.. . Rooms do not have Internet access or even wifi.  Cell reception is spotty at best, don't know if it is the area or the hotel.. . . Staff was friendly and always smiling,  . . Hallways are confusing.. . Second floor is where the shows are located.  And McDonald's.. . Next time I will stay on the north side of the strip.. . Upside, I'm changing to Mandalay Bay today.
