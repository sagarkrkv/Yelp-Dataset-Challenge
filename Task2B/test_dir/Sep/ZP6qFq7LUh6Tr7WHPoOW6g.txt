Wow!  This place is good!  The atmosphere is modern, the staff are kind (sometimes slow), the food is always amazing. I don't think I've had one thing bad here. However, the prices are a bit high. But then again, it's the only place around where the food is made from scratch. Their homemade potato chips and potato salad are insanely good. I don't normally go for mayo on anything, but it's absolute perfection. Their posole is amazing (love that it's clear broth and not red), Reuben sandwich is amazing, breakfast foods are perfection and those potatoes. This is definitely a comfort food place to go, if you want to take a nap afterwards. No joke!!  It's unbelievable. Pricey, but worth it. I guess. If you don't have the money, you should probably stick with Taco Bell and don't complain about how much it costs. The owner(s) probably want to buy a bigger house, put their kids through college and they have something really amazing here, so why the heck not!!  The prices haven't hindered the majority of clients from going here. So be mindful of what you order. Also know, if you're on a budget, I believe they have an ala cart menu and you can purchase 2 to 3 things and keep it under $10. . Enjoy!!
i come here everytime i come to vegas.  A little loud inside, but the food makes up for everything.
Holy crap this place was good.  My friends and I took a walk here from Fremont Street during our guy's trip to Vegas because of the great Yelp reviews.  It did not disappoint.  We sat at the common table and were immediately greeted by the friendly staff.  Shortly after we sat down, a woman over-heard us talking about appetizers and immediately interrupted us to tell us we had to order the deviled-eggs.  Wow was she spot on.  The egg whites were deep-fried while the yokes were mixed with amazing-ness and put back onto the newly deep-fried egg whites.  We found out later that the woman who suggested it was the owner of the restaurant.  Turns out she knows what she's talking about.. . After that I had the veggieburger which was by far the best I ever had.  I don't even know what else to say aboutit, just get it, or anything else on their menu.. . I would definitely come back here.  It's also conveniently located next to container park which is always fun to walk through.  Bring your llama.
The fries meal is flippin awesome and the hunky bartenders in logger outfits are a nice touch. Top ten favorite bar downtown.
This place was such a pleasant surprise!  Everything was fresh, mostly seemed to be local and was chef inspired.  The bacon and eggs were simple but we'll executed.  The truffle egg sandwich was very unique and a must for a repeat visit.  Service was above averge.  Seating is limited,  has outdoor seating also.
It's funny reading other Yelp reviews about how this place is located in a sketchy part of the neighborhood makes me think these people must not have been to the older version of the Lower East Side in New York City. True, this part of Las Vegas isn't part of the Strip and it doesn't have the frills of big hotels and casinos - but that's the beauty of Downtown. I love that the restaurants around here still carries the vibe of old Las Vegas. . . Eat is no exception - it's located on the corner of an old apartment complex. The decor is very unpretentious nor is it trying to be hipster. It's very clean with an open kitchen concept. The staff is friendly and so is the owner, Natalie. . . We came here on a Sunday morning,expecting a long wait. I guess we came at a perfect time because everyone else must have been asleep or something coz there was no line at all. The bar counter had seats available which was perfect coz that's where we preferred to sit anyway. . . We ordered the Corned Beef Hash, the Strawberry Biscuits and BLT with tomato salad.  The corned beef was really good - just the right balance of saltiness and it was also quite tender. Also I liked that it didn't have too much potatoes. I could also tell that they source their bread from a good purveyor coz I loved how their sour dough tasted. I took a bite of my friend's BLT - delish!  And I'm finicky about the coffee in breakfast places coz 8 out 10 places don't serve good coffee. This place certainly cares about the coffee they serve their patrons. Love their coffee!  I take mine decaf - but it was still full bodied. It's really good, they even have them in packages for people to buy!. . Reviewers complaining about the prices being high - I don't really care about that. I would much rather spend money on good food than waste a few dollars on lousy food. This place doesn't take shortcuts on preparing their food and the ingredients that they use. And that takes money hence the price is reflective of that. Now if they charged high and served crappy food, that's another story. . . This place is certainly worth my money. I shall be back.
If you want a good breakfast, I'd recommend venturing outside of the strip to this small joint a block outside of the main street in downtown Las Vegas. Expect a wait, because it tends to get really crowded. There's not much shade or seating outside while you wait so beware of the heat during the summer. We were taken here by a LV local, but I dunno if it's really a "local" place.. . I got the eggs benedict, and wow, I don't know if it's because I was nearing the end of my road trip from San diego to Denver and back again and was eating subway/in&out everyday, but that Benedict just made my DAY. ShOOt. The benedict was topped with a perfect little egg - poached to perfection - covered with hollandaise, under which lay strips of thick turkey bacon, swiss or thick cheese of some sort, tomato, greens, and a nicely toasted piece of bread. The egg had a GREAT ooze to it as you slowly cut into the center of the yoke, adding to the taste and texture. The bacon was so thick i had to chew slower than I wanted to. On the side was a heaping of potatoes, seasoned well. . . Definitely a great change from huge and not very good portions served at quick joints on the strip, but super filling! Friends got shrimp and grits, pancakes, country fried steak, all of which no one complained about. I'd come back again!!!
Came for brunch. We had the shrimp and grits and BLT, coffee, OJ, toast. . . - We liked the energy of the restaurant. . - the shrimp were just a little over cooked. - the grits were good, and dipping the toast into the surrounding sauce was fantastic!. - the BLT was good.. - the house made chips were great. . - the best part was sitting at the counter and watching the kitchen staff. Best show in town :P
Downtown Las Vegas gem.  We had a group of eight and service was excellent. The Downtown Benedict was yummy. I love the turkey bacon, whole wheat English muffin and spinach. I also had the short stack pancakes! Yum! We also had the corn beef hash. It is a must when you come here. The coffee is great. . If you are staying downtown or entertaining family and friends you need to visit this place!
With an excellent following this place is only open for breakfast and lunch.  It has good food at reasonable prices.  The place is always packed with customers and the line is out the door with more. It is definitely a place you must try if only once. Once you have though you a find yourself coming back again. So if you are downtown in Vegas get off the e beaten path and go eat.
great place for breakfast. Hipster-ish atmosphere, great coffee (medium roast, no acidity), amazing food.. I had the shrimp and grits (amazing), hubby had the country fried steak, and his brother had the tomato soup (wow, delicious) with grilled cheese (Texas toast, extra bacon). We were so full, I can't believe I didn't finish everything off the plate.. Owner was present, which always makes a good impression. They seem to have bussers (clean tables, clear tables, bring drinks), and servers (take food orders); food was brought out by kitchen personnel. . Do yourself a favor and experience their food, I promise you won't be disappointed!!
Great place, small, clean, and fast service for Saturday morning. Shrimp and grits was delicious. If in Vegas must try.
Was disappointed they replaced the beignets on the menu, saw it on yelp and that's what made my decision to go there.... . However, menu options were amazing and tasty! Large portions, should've shared because I don't have a microwave in my hotel room. . . Server in particular was NOT very nice, the rest of the staff was very nice and accommodating-didn't look at me like my requests were ridiculous. . . Over all, thumbs up and I would try this place again.
We tried this place and will definitely be back! My 6 yr old son is a picky eater but had not problem eating up his Pancakes and wanting more. The price is right on for what your getting, the food, the vibe, the nice view of the Container Park. It was nice to be Downtown and really enjoying it. Can't wait to go back. . . Sparkling Strawberry Lemonade: GREAT. Lemonade: GREAT. Pancakes: INCREDIBLY GREAT. DT Benedict: GREAT
Just flew into town and was looking for a place to eat  breakfast before hitting the outlets.  I had seen them on a Food Network show and liked the style and look of the food as well as the spot.   It did not disappoint.   Service was nice from the start and carried over well, however a little slow at some points.   The food was spot on though.   My wife had the eggs benedict which was awesome, although the Hollandaise was a bit more citrusy than I'm used to.   Still very good though.   I ordered the corned beef hash and loved it.   I must say that this was the first time I've ever had corned beef hash where the chunks of fresh corned beef out numbered the potatoes 2 to 1 !    It really was good though with chunks of meat and onion and potato.  Maybe next time we'll try some of the pancakes because they looked really good!
I went for my second visit for lunch there after far too long. I got the BLT... SOOOO good. The bread ALONE on the sandwich is worth ordering. I got the side of potato salad, again, delicious and full of flavor. Service is quick and friendly. I highly recommend for a casual lunch with friends or colleagues. It's also really fun that they keep a few breakfast items on the menu all day.
I saw this place online and read awesome things about it, so went down with my husband to try it out on a Sunday morning. The place was ridiculously packed... 20 minute wait to get a seat for 2.  We sat down and looked at the menu, which looked awesome.  I ordered the eggs benedict ... which was cold when I got it... other than that everything was "meh" I definately will not be bringing my family over there when they visit on a Sunday morning.
Just ok! We missed breakfast, I was with a party of 4. Fairly long wait time. Average service. Meals were mediocre at best. I probably had the winner of the bunch...the Shrimp Po boy with homemade chips---great!
Leaving Vegas & my brother wanted to check it out.  Was a little annoyed at the 45 minute wait to be seated (possibly from the hangover.) The food was well worth the wait and I would recommend huevos montelones or the grilled cheese.  The service was very good & kept my coffee filled.
Eat is a solid, three star brunch joint. I enjoyed my meal here.  It's a mostly good spot.  Anyone reading this seeing 3 stars and thinking it's a bad review, it's not! But there were several issues during our meal that made this place miss the 4 star level.. . One place they excel: the pancake. It's thick and fluffy, while still being crispy on the outside. I rarely order pancakes, but after two bites, I was hooked.  The homemade tomato soup was quite good, with large, thin chunks or parmesan floating on top. Also, the coffee served here is excellent.. . We also tried the truffled egg sandwich. I've seen other reviewers rave about this, but something was missing. The bread wasn't good, and the flavors of the ingredients didn't meld well together. . . The service here was lacking.  It seems to be focused on turnover rather than true customer interaction. Our server asked us about five times if we were ready to order.  Once we were finished, three different people asked if we wanted the check.  We weren't checked on a single time while dining. . . Lastly, the name is kind of dumb:. "Hey, you want to go eat?" . "Sure, what are you thinking?". "How about eat?". "....I know, like, what place". "No...the restaurant in downtown called eat, silly". "...". . . Bottom Line: A fine brunch/lunch spot, and certainly better than a lot of otherLas Vegas spot. They serve brunch daily, which is really nice if you are visiting and everyday seems like a Saturday.  Maybe I went on an off day, but this place is already good and has potential to get better.
Fresh vibe, fresh people, and fresh ingredients. I came here for the brunch because who doesn't like breakfast foods in the middle of the day? Or night? ;) Even better the food is sourced from local vendors and is considerably healthy. I went for the truffled scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms, chives and bacon on ciabatta, and diced potatoes. It's a lot of food on one plate. I ate the sandwich open-face style and tossed a slice of ciabatta off to the side. The eggs are light and fluffy. You can literally smell the truffle on them and taste it before it hits your tongue. The bacon was crispy the way I like it. Did I forget to mention that there's feta? They hide it in the eggs so you don't see it at first glance. A nice little surprise that's for sure. I def recommend it. . . Summary: Quick service. Big smiles. Social atmosphere. Open kitchen. Fun menu. Tasty eats. Great choice.
The country fried steak was so small they need to rename it the county fried steak. They would have gotten 5 stars if my waiter had been a waitress.
Tried because of all the awesome reviews. They were right. This place is really really good. Nothing I tried was average or bad, just yummy. . . Careful if you walk there though, walked past a few folks who partied too hard the not before and didn't make it home. Semi-sketchy part of town, but it is Vegas, so....
