The worst customer service EVER. I called for something at the front desk 4 times, and it was never brought up! Never again.
I booked 2 king rooms and got 2 double beds instead! Upon arrival my in room phone did not work so I had to get in elevator and go down 19 floors if I needed anything from front desk, and there was no safe, refrigerator or coffee maker in room! After 2 days I got moved to a king room while the other guests we booked for were moved to the same room they had, just next door in hotel from us, thought they would get a king bed too since it's what I booked. The tub didn't drain well at all, and using a waste basket or bathroom sink to keep beverages cold was ridiculous!!!! I will for sure be trying a different hotel next time I'm in Vegas, one who hopefully has customer service!! Rude front desk staff at Trop, however the casino and casino workers were wonderful and the pool area was beautiful but Mandalay bay is better!!!
Was there August 30th 2014 for the Xposed Beach Party so will only review that-did NOT stay there.  Thank goodness got on the list and arrived before 1pm so we didn't have to pay.  It would not be worth the cover charge.  And unless you pay top dollar for some cabana or beds there is hardly anywhere to sit/lay down.  Mid-afternoon the largest bar to right of entrance just closed down!  Supposedly something about the health department shutting it down.  Hmmmm  So that left 1 bar outside for all the guys and gals that were there.  Insane!!!!  Only plus for me was looking at the gorgeous Xposed pool boy that was going around taking everybody's picture with the frame.
The renovations have resulted in a bright, modern hotel on the inside -- a bit odd "whitewashed" looking on the outside (not sure what they were going for, as it's not very "tropical").  . . Our room was perfect - clean, well maintained.  Our only complaint is the distance to the room, which was in the tower by the conference facility.  These are, however, the newer rooms, so we had none of the problems noted by others with respect to smells or plumbing.. . The casino isn't the most 'happening' place, but less smoky than others, and we felt more relaxed than at other casinos.  The beverage servers are great, and we did well at the slot machines.. . My biggest complaint is the limited casual food -- one cafe, and one junky food court type arrangement.  The cafe is very expensive for what you get -- more options would have been appreciated. . . Service was uniformly good, particularly the check in desk, and the bellmen at the front door who were adept at handling checked bags, getting cabs, etc.  They were very outgoing and friendly, and I saw that they treated everyone well, even those who didn't tip.  The hotel definitly knows who to put "out front.". . Location is very good, for the lower end of the Strip.  Pools are nice.
Stayed here this past weekend for Labor Day, and I must say I will not be staying here again. . . 1) Air Conditioner does not work.  Cold air was not blowing through the vents. . . 2) Bathroom was just out-dated and the room did not have a fridge.  You would think they would provide one, considering the high Resort Fees. . . 3) Poor Housekeeping, asked for extra bedding in the evening.  Did not come until the next morning.  Where they just knocked on the door and left it on the floor.  . . Overall, the experience was not as good as other places I have stayed in Las Vegas. . The only thing that was decent was the beds, which were comfortable, but nothing to boast about.
Definitely on the tacky side and definitely not a happening  place which would make it better for someone staying for a convention. . But the pool is only opened from 9am to 7pm and the exercise room is only open from 6pm to 7pm.. For a city that is supposed to be going all night this is quite restrictive.  If you are here for work or play this is quite restrictive.
David Boozer & Melissa from the front desk were amazing upon check in. We had some articles with our accommodations and they were quick to make it right and provided quick friendly service the entire time! Because of these two I will come back to the Tropicana to stay. I actually opened a yelp account today because I was so angry/irritated upon check in I intended to write a scathing review but Melissa and David did a great job! The room that we ended up in is perfect, clean, and the amenities are great, some of the previous rooms left something to be desired.
I stayed here this week for a  5 dayconference.  Booked my room through Priceline and got the room for $37. a night on Priceline. Even with the $18 additional reort fee this is a great deal. My only complaint and suggestion is to be sure to get a room facing the pool.  Mine was facing the strip and it was noisy, even on the 18th floor.. Very friendly staff.
You would expect at least decent drink service in a casino. This one is by far the worst. The cocktail servers aren't polite and even if they are one machine over will tell you that they will be over in a moment. What is the purpose of even having them? Oh and that moment has been 10 minutes since I started typing this review. The machines are loose and that's a major positive. But their level of service is seriously lacking in all other respects.
