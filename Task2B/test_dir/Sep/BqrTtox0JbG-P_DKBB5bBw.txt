This place is delicious. Shakes with liquor blended in, genius. This would have been a 5 rating, but note the following: our waitress was nowhere to be found (bus boy came to start our order after 15 mins of just sitting around), the free seasoned popcorn was over seasoned (careful when you munch down, the powder may make you cough) & the onion rings and sweet potato fries are average (pass on these if you're thinking about ordering extra). Now they are known for their burgers. I have not a negative thing to say, they are delicious and highly recommended.
My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place for a really long time, so we finally visited! When we arrived, the hostess told us we had 3 options, the bar, lounge area or the dining room which was all full service but bar and lounge are open seating. The lounge area looked cozy and comfy so we settled for that. After sitting on the couch, it took about 10 minutes for us to get a hello from a server and the menus, quite ridiculous but forgiving. She was very polite but not very attentive. After we ordered the food, it came out sooner than we thought. We ordered the rising sun & the gold standard! Both were very tasty, rich and juicy. The food covered the exceptional service. After our meal, we ordered the grasshopper milk shake which was phenomenal, I am not a huge fan of mint but my boyfriend is so I gave in to his liking. I honestly can say I have second thought, about mint flavors because it was delicious! I loved the malt so much better, very sweet and made to perfection. Most likely coming back but maybe just not as a first option.
wow this place really hits the spot!!! Amazing appetizer (fried grits), oreo shake, onion rings and sweet potato fries and 2 amazing amazing burgers! i love this place, perfect place to hit up right after you leave marquee
Nom nom nom.. . Great food. Great service. I had the Meatball Burger  with onion rings. It was delicious, but a bit messy.. . Eat here and get a burger. Enjoy.
I've been wanting to try this place forever, because the burgers and shakes look incredible.  However, I go there and what do I get?!  The Soft Shell Crab Bruschetta and a Maui Coconut Porter Beer.  However, I do not regret my choices.  Both were absolutely incredible!  My Dad had sliders, fries, and the Root Beer Float and he said it was great.  And my sister had the Urth Sliders (Vegan patties) with the S'Mores milkshake.  And she loved hers.  And the service might have been the absolute best I've ever had anywhere!  Our Server's name was Robin, and she was spectacular!  Very friendly, very good at her job.  I definitely will be going back there soon for a buger and fries and I will be asking for Robin again!  Great place!
Great food and great atmosphere. Try to Small Plates if you don't want to stuff yourselves but hey, it's Vegas so all (diet) bets are off, right? Recommended.
Our first stop upon touching down in Vegas!!. . Pros:. 1. Huge sandwich. 2. quality beef. 3. variety. . Cons:. 1. French fries were below average (both sweet potato and regular). 2. Most may not find this as a con, but i felt the buns were too much, when i eat a burger i want to taste the quality of the the "inner sandwich" in which the bun is holding everything together and gives a mild taste.. 3. Drink selection should be more diverse. . Overall a good sandwich, ive had better but will do again when back to Vegas!!
My favorite shake (the Cereal Bowl) is gone! It's okay, though...I drowned my sorrows in a Drunken Monkey (Reese's, banana, malt, Frangelico) and felt much better.. . Holstein's has some pretty amazing ranch dressing, so ask for a side to go with your fries.. . Their veggie patty is also delicious--it's especially good when you sub it in the Fun-Ghi.
Went here with a friend tonight. First of all, the setting was very nice with a animation-esque theme. The hostess told us that we could sit at the bar or the dining area, both of which have tvs. I had the Gold Standard burger ($18.50) and my friend had the big fat greek burger($18) with $2 sub sweet potato fries. We also shared the Tiramisu shake ($13). When the shake came out, our waiter gave us a steel mixing cup and a glass cup with the shake. I was wondering what that steel cup was and when I looked inside it was more of the shake. I guess they made extra and they were courteous enough to give the rest of it to us. The shake was pretty good and less sweet (thank God) than the shakes at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR. The burgers came out pretty quick (maybe in 10-15 minutes). It wasn't that busy so that helped. The fries come out in a small, aluminum bucket which is kinda unique. The Gold Standard burger was great. I liked especially the arugula and the tomato confit. Those veges balanced the heavy flavors of the bacon, cheese, and burger. Unfortunately, I noticed the fries at the middle and bottom of my bucket were a little soggy and oily. I tried my friend's greek burger which had greek spiced lamb. She had the tsaziki sauce on the side and I thought that was a good decision especially for this burger. The sauce had mint in it and my friend didn't like it. I, on the other hand, thought it worked bc I've hand lamb with mint jelly before. My friend told the waiter she didn't like the tsaziki sauce and the waiter was kind enough to bring out a cajun remoulade sauce instead. That cajun remoulade sauce was pretty good and tasted like thousand island with some cajun seasoning. My friend's sweet potato fries were great as they were crispy and did not taste oily at all. The service was great and attentive. Even though the burgers were on the pricey side (most were $16-$18), I would come back again bc of the casual setting, fast service, and the yummy tasting burgers and shakes.
The burger here is so freakin good. If you're a burger person, Holsteins is the place to go. Make it a mission in your life to try this place.. . I got the Gold Standard, $17.50. Dry aged beef sirloin burger w/smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli. Heaven in my mouth. The beef was cooked just as I requested. Even the sweet potato fries were made to perfection!
I came her for a quick lunch before heading to Marquee dayclub and boy oh boy am I glad I did !. . Food: My friend and I decided to share everything we ordered which consisted of the ahi tuna tostada, the billionaire burger, and the banana cream pie shake. The ahi tuna tostadas were a great app to start the meal with! The fish was fresh and the lemony avocado sauce was very refreshing and a great compliment to the dish. However, I was amazed at how delicious the burger was! The burger had foie gras in it which is a food item banned in LA. I decided to jump on the chance to try it and I absolutely loved it. As for the banana cream pie shake, I usually don't like shakes but this one was a guilty pleasure ! However, I must say it would be too much for one so  I recommend to share with another person and sorry to be a bearer of bad news but  kids you can't have any because it is spiked with alcohol!. . Service: Our server was always attentive and came back a couple of times to refill our water so no complaints!  But shame on him for offering us the shake and dessert menu! I probably gained 1377384893 pounds, but that shake was oh so worth it!. . Final Verdict: One of the best burger places I have EVER tried!
We arrived without a reservation at 8PM on a Saturday night and had to wait about 45 minutes. They said they'd text us, so we went down to the casino and did some gambling. 45 minutes later, I received no text, so we went back upstairs and checked in. We were seated after a brief pause, which made me wonder how long I'd be waiting for a text if I didn't go up and check back in.. . We ordered the onion rings and two of their boozy milkshakes. A coworker recommended I try the onion rings, and they were fantastic. The order came out quick, as did the milkshakes. The milkshakes were awesome, barely a booze taste and worth the price.. . Our entrees on the other hand took quite a while to arrive. I would guess nearly 30 minutes. The waitress said the kitchen was backed up, but for a burger place on a Saturday night I had a hard time believing they weren't prepared for the evening rush.. . I had the pork belly sliders which were excellent. If you've had pork buns at a Chinese restaurant, they were like that, including the soft bun and the sauce, but crispier and better. They serve 3 to a plate, which was enough for me but I was already getting full from the milkshake and the onion rings.. . My wife had the Classic burger and said it was alright, but nothing extra ordinary. Considering it took 30+ minutes to come out, she said it was about as good as she's had at Red Robin. I had a bite and it was fine, but again I don't think it was anything amazing. It was a decent burger, properly cooked to a medium rare, not exceptionally huge or covered in exotic toppings, and considering the prices in Vegas, it was worth the $14.. . Best part of the meal was the milkshakes and the onion rings. A word of caution about the milkshakes - they  fill you up! If you finish one it's like eating a huge ice cream sundae with booze on it. They are definitely worth the price.. . If I'm gambling at or near the Cosmopolitan I'd give the place another try, maybe for lunch. The food was good and the price was right.
Cool joint, shakes were delicious as were the burgers.  Great service as well! Didn't love the buffalo dip though.
I don't care how good the burgers are. The background music is blaring so loud I my husband had a hard time talking to each other. The restaurant is so loud because everyone else has to talk over the music too! When I say loud I mean "clubbing" loud! Oh, & I'm not some old person complaining either. I'm in my 30's. I actually got a nasty headache just waiting on my burger. Nice!
Way over priced for small portions of mediocre food and dry burgers... Thier shakes are good though but that's it
This was our first stop during our Vegas weekend and we grabbed a few things to share. Their menu is perfect for that since they have Nosh (apps) and Tiny Buns (sliders) on the menu in addition to full size dishes.. . They start you off with a little bucket of popcorn and seems the flavor changes - the first time we had the Cajun...yum.  We had the Holsteins sliders which showed that this place makes some legit burgers, even in mini-size. The Ahi Poke Tostadas were tasty little bites of goodness - I could've eaten 2 orders had we not been trying to save ourselves for dinner! We also shared the Crispy Pork Belly Buns...I came back for more of these soft, Bao-like "tacos". The pork belly has a gorgeous crisp on the outside with a tender inside and is a perfect fit for the soft, fluffy bun. On the second visit, I ordered more of these along with their Truffle Lobster Mac n Cheese. It was creamy with big chunks of lobster. The chip and lobster garnish was so good, it could be it's own dish. Maybe it's the lobster salad from the Lobster Rolls? And, since it was late morning, I tried the Spicy Bloody Mary which is made with a jalapeno cilantro infused vodka. Bold flavor with a lingering heat. The hubby got a Strawberry Shake that he thoroughly enjoyed.. . We were sat quickly both visits. The second visit was Sunday morning during football so we opted to skip the $40 hourly charge for their bar tables...but there was a table in the back that had 2 TVs just no sound. . . Service was good both visits. Food came out quick and hot. . . If they could put a Holsteins into a Reno or Tahoe Casino, I would be a very happy carnivore! I've been to some incredible burger places lately and this is one I will definitely make a point to visit next time I am in LV!
Holstein's is a great option! . . It's definitely a busy and hip restaurant! Fits right in with the Cosmopolitan vibe. The restaurant has fun artwork! There is a big yet diverse menu, although the restaurant is a bit overpriced. . . Great burgers! Yummy milkshakes! And good service!
We came here deciding it was better to grab a burger than a fancy meal after too much Fat Tuesdays....  I was not disappointed, possibly the best burger I have ever had.  Sure it's overpriced (the whole strip is), but I can't knock it for that.  Service as good and the odd cow art makes for a cool environment.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed either!
Visited here this past week.  It was our first time in the Cosmopolitan and we came to Holsteins because we had heard of the great alcoholic milkshakes.  We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by Tamia (hope I spelled her name correctly).  She was attentive and very friendly throughout our somewhat lengthy stay there.  Drinks were great and the hamburgers each if us had were fantastic.  Very tasty, cooked perfectly and massive.  Of course after the burgers of course we had to try the milkshakes.  Yummy!. . We are going back to Vegas in late October and plan on returning.  Definitely worth the time and money.
Holsteins is a great option from one of the many burger places to try in Vegas. It is conveniently located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. The great thing about them was that when you sign in, they take down your phone number so they can contact you when your table is available. We were told to wait 20 minutes, but we barely waited 10. We got seated pretty fast and service was friendly. I love the decorations they have in the restaurant. The alcoholic milkshakes got my attention. I am SO glad I tried it! I got the mint chocolate chip flavor milkshake. It was the BOMB! You barely taste the alcohol only the after taste, but it's definitely something new and something everyone over the age should try when visiting this place. My friend and I split a burger (I forgot what it was called) and sea steak sliders. I just like to try different things and let me tell you, you can't go wrong with either one of them! But.. I'm glad we shared the burger and the sliders. The burger is pretty big so I don't know if I could've finished it all by myself. The burger was juicy and a greasy, which was a great balance with the refreshing sea steak sliders. It took a while to get our orders, but it's understandable because it was pretty busy and we were a party of 5. The complimentary popcorn sure made it better.
I really stand by my love of Holstein's.  I went here with a client.  She had a turkey burger (and loved it).  I had the lamb burger.  Deeeeelish.  We also shared a large salad, and opted for the coleslaw over a side of fries/onion rings.  I have had the onion rings tho, and they are great.. . A couple nights later, I drunkenly stopped by to pick up a milkshake to go.  I got the Drunken Monkey and it was soooooooooo good.  I drank it almost completely on my walk from the restaurant to my room.  If you want something decadent, don't order room service dessert at the Cosmo.  Just run over to Holstein's and buy a few milkshakes.  TO KILL FOR.. . All in all, I've never had a bad meal here and the service is ALWAYS friendly.
The unexpected touches are what elevated this from a 3 to a 4 star experience for me. I'd read the reviews, so I already planned on getting a boozy milkshake, skipping the sliders, and ordering the Rising Sun (Kobe beef, teriyaki, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado) - all of which were fantastic recommendations. (Thanks Yelp!). . But I wasn't expecting the complimentary popcorn (that our group quickly renamed crack-corn), nor was I expecting the complimentary nitro meringues to finish off the meal. It was clear that the servers, even on a busy Saturday night, were eager to make our experience memorable. And from start to finish, that's exactly what it was.
The food and shakes here are wonderful! . . I went with a girlfriend here one night and we split a Chocolate-covered Strawberry Shake and a Gold Standard Burger. . . The shake tasted just like a chocolate-covered strawberry! Totally hit the spot! Itwas a very comfortable portion for two people. . . We added sprouts to our burger, which was excellent, I recommend you add those if you're a fan of sprouts. The burger overall was great and the fries that came with it we're totally up-to-par on the fries scale.. . The service was cool. Everyone was nice and attentive, BUT they were almost too attentive. I felt like I was being rushed out of the restaurant and it wasn't even a busy time - I was there on a Tuesday night around 9 pm. Otherwise, I had a great time at Holstein's and I will definitely come again.
As far as burgers go, Holsteins was very good, but not $18 good.  . . I ordered the Fun-ghi burger (I LOVE me some sauteed mushrooms and onions and gruyere cheese) and the beef patty was well cooked and flavorful. I really enjoyed the brioche bun, but was kind of underwhelmed by the entire burger....perhaps I should have gone with the Rising Sun? Fries were mediocre at best. . . Service was very friendly, but kinda slow. And we didn't get free popcorn :(. . LOVED the cute little painted cows, and the location in the Cosmo is very convenient for hanging out on the Strip.. . All in all, not bad but not the greatest I've ever had :) 3 solid stars!
try the mint sugar smokey stuff
Brah, Holsteins is effing good!!!! I ordered the billionaire burger which was only $32 -what a deal! I think it had expensive beef in it, but what caught my eye was the slab of foie gras!! First bite, I was in foie gras heaven! Since CA ban the sale of foie gras, I have not had it in a very long time. All that richness flavors that make foie gras a big deal was present! The burger patty was cooked perfectly rare. Now, most would be like wondering why I am not talking about the burger patty; well what ever kind of beef they use is not a issue with me because all those labels on types of beef is over rated. For example, if it was really Kobe Beef it would have been a very small piece of it for Holsteins to only charge 32 bucks. They said the mayo spread had truffles or maybe they used truffle oil, it doesn't matter because I did not taste it. The star of this dish was the slab of seared foie gras and that perfectly cooked patty. It made me happy! The star power of the foie gras was so great I wasn't even sure if I got fries or onion rings with my meal, oh well! I can't wait to come back again for more foie gras!!!
Free Popcorn - Tasty.. Drunken Monkey Shake - Reece's, Banana, Malt, Frangelico - Yummy. Barely tasted the alcohol. Enough for two to share.. The Fun-Ghi - Beef Patty, Truffle Marinated Portabella Mushroom, Carmelized Onion, Gruyere, Mayonnaise, Frisee - Meh. Overpriced. Didn't taste the truffle and the frisee was scratchy and didn't add much.. The Rising Sun - Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, Tempura Avocado and added fried egg. - Beef was dry..Glad it had the friend egg. Not worth the price.. . Overpriced burgers with free popcorn and a yummy shake.
I like the fact that they make their own buns and the patties.and Option to have sweet potato fries.. The "rising sun" was the burger of its word. You might want to come back just to get that ..... The Urth burger was good too, the vegan pattie is also made in the house.
Way Over priced for small portion and terrible costumer service! Would never return. $70 lunch and they automatically add the tip which they don't mention for a server who stopped at your table twice and was to busy to refill your water glass! Thanks but no thanks
Holsteins was yummerz! I love the atmosphere and the funky artwork surrounding the restaurant. . . I ordered the quesadillas (with grilled steak, lobster, and cheese, garnished with garlic chive aioli and cilantro!) as an appetizer and got the fun-ghi burger (w/ truffle marinated mushrooms, angus beef, frisee!). The burger was good, but I really liked the appetizer. Steak and lobster in a tortilla is surprisingly good! . . As for service, it was pretty good, but I think our server kind of seemed aloof. Attentive but was not really engaged with us in the way he spoke. . . Would come back for the food though!
Super tasty burgers although I wasn't too keen on the fries as they were a bit salty for my liking.. . Absolutely love the alcoholic milkshakes too. I had the birthday cake one and it was so delicious and tasted exactly like the title suggests.  Service was really good, food was served quickly and you get tonnes of milkshake for your money. . . Will be back again for sure.
Apple pie milkshake!!! :)
We ate here in the bar at about 9 pm on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. The rising sun burger was amazing. My husband said the onion rings were perfect. Note if you order your burger medium it will be quite raw. So go over the cooking level with the waitress when you order.. Also this place was very crowded and loud. We think if we ever went back we'd go at about 5pm. Nightclub loud for dinner is not our thing as we are in our 50s.. Great burgers though!
A friend and i visited shortly after i moved here and i, in turn, have taken three different groups of friends since then. The adult shakes are pure heaven - best $15 ever spent, lol. Pick any flavor, you wont be disappointed. I have tried several appetizers and they are all good. My fave is the buffalo dip. I really want to deduct a star because the music is so damn loud you literally cant hear yourself think (much less talk to anyone), but i just cant do it. The food, the shakes and the service are all spot on!
We are waiting since 40mins to know about the vegan burger bun has no egg in it. The waiters here doesn't know anything about it. They don't even know if they have eggs in breads. The waiter is not even coming back to reply. Very very bad service.
Burgers are awesome!  Drunken monkey milk shake out of this world. My 4th time here. Luv it.
Yes. Yes. Yes. So yummy and such great service. I had my burger on a lettuce wrap w/ sweet potato fries & tiramisu shake. Perfect!
Excellent burgers and adult milkshakes!  I had the Greek burger and it tasted just like agro, DELISH!!!!  We sat at the bar, Tamia waited in us, she was friendly, knowledgeable, and really enhanced our experience!  We will most definitely return here again,possibly the best burger in Vegas!!!!
The burgers are by far the best I've had in a long time. They are pricy for burgers and shakes, buts it's well worth it. You will leave the restaurant full and satisfied. I had the Nom Nom burger, which had pepper jack cheese and potato chips inside  my honey had the caliente burger, which was very flavorful, but not too spicy. We had "grown up" (contained alcohol) shakes. If you're like me and have a sweet tooth you will be in shake heaven!!!! If you're in Vegas this is a must have!!! It's too bad there isn't one in Cali. 5 stars and a !
I've been here before always get a burger which are pretty good the milk shakes that have alcohol don't really taste like it not do they get you not even a slightest buzzed. Today I got the Thai steak salad
After experiencing the worst burger I've ever had in Vegas, I felt compelled to email Holsteins to give them the opportunity to explain why my experience was so bad. Never heard back from Holsteins, which to me, is one of the hallmarks of poor customer service. The burger was dry, tasteless and very expensive. Don't mind paying nearly $20 for a burger, but it should be damned near as good as a burger can get. Save your dough and go to any fast food drive-in for your burger; it will taste better, and you'll have enough scratch left over for a movie.
After spending an hour at Louis Vuitton at Crystals, I came here for dinner.  The place was not busy at 6:30 on a Thursday night.  I was seated quickly and looked over the menu.  My server, Kayla, brought me iced tea quickly and then I ordered.. . I got the El Caliente burger.  The menu describes it this way:  Beef Patty Topped w/ Pepper Jack Cheese, Pickled Jalapeno, Avocado, Pork Chicharrones & Tequila-Cilantro Mayo.  I asked for the burger to be cooked rare and it came out just that way.  Score.. . There's a lot going on with the burger.  While there is some spiciness from the jalapeno, que no es real caliente.  This is something that anyone can eat unless they have no tolerance at all for anything that has the slightest spiciness.. . The chicharrones with the cheese and soft meat was a nice combination of textures. The burger was very juicy and I had to use my napkin several times to keep from getting juices from fingers to clothes.  The fries were good.  They didn't need salt which was good because there were no salt nor pepper shakers in sight.. . I passed on dessert because it was more of a share kind of thing and I didn't want four brownies, two dips of ice cream and all the other accouterments that went with the dessert I was thinking of ordering.. . Service was good.  I felt sorry for Kayla because access to the table I was at was partially blocked by a stroller from the family at the next table./  Their kids were very good and it was the birthday of one of them and the staff brought him a milkshake with a candle.  A note to the parents--leave the damn Webster's Elementary Dictionary in the room.  You don't have to look up words and discuss with your kids at dinner.. . A pleasant meal.
After hearing so much about Holsteins, I had to try it during my first trip to Vegas. I waa not disappointed. I made reservations on open table since I'd heard it can get busy. The restaurant even called that morning to confirm my reservation. Pretty impressed considering this is a Millennial restaurant. My friend and I arrived at 1pm sharp and were promptly seated. The restaurant has a separate bar area but both have a lively atmosphere. Our waiter haveus some time to look over the menu, and brought a small bucket of their complimentary popcorn which my friend declared was "addicting." We caught a glimpse of a burger going out to a table and they're huge! Way too much for me. Our waiter asked if it was our first time dining there. When we said yes he gave us a few suggestions. We took his digestion and decided to split a Rising Sun burger with sweet potato fries and a lobster roll with regular fries. We also ordered the Philly egg rolls. In case you hadn't heard, Holsteins is known for their milkshakes. I ordered a black and whire, and my friend got a creme bruise. Both were amazing. The Philly egg rolls were delicious. The burger was tasty. Tempura avocado won me over. The only disappointment was the lobster roll. It was just ok. Not worth the price or the calories. . . Service was definitely above average. My water glass was never empty and all of my questions were well answered. Plus since I asked for a souvenir or waiter gave me a drink koozy. Woohoo! Any way I can't wait to go back and try another burger and shake.
I've been here a few times and the Gold Standard burger is my first choice. Can't go wrong.
Good is great here. The service was sub par though. Very surprising, but fairly unfriendly in the bar area, and very slow in the restaurant. I have been several times, and it seems like something has changed here--I past visits the place was great. We will probably opt for another place next time.
Was able to walk in and be seated for a party of 15 on a Friday night at about 7pm with a 20 minute wait.
Yeah - don't waste your time.  That's my opinion and I haven't even seen the menu yet.  First comment from BOTH the hostess AND the maitre'd was 'we can't seat you till the other member of your party arrives.".  How about "welcome, we're glad you are here, can I get you a drink'.  Underwhelmed!! This with over 20 tables empty (eg less than half full) .  YIKES!! Don't bother!!
