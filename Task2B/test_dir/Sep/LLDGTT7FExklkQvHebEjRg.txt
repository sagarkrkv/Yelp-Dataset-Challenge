Just ate at the restaurant after reading the reviews on yelp. The service and people were nice, but the stone crab claws were mealy (the fatty part, not the meat). We spoke with the waitress and a manager. they were both gracious and took off 20% from the bill, but the manager said that's how the crab was suppose to be, "because it came from the ocean." I've never had a mealy crab before. I didn't like the texture. The flavor was good.. . According to the menu, one crab claw was ripped from each crab on the boat, and the crab was then released. I'm guessing that the claw has to be frozen with this technique.  I'm accustomed to having the whole crab just boiled live. Maybe mealy crab is something to get accustomed to for sustainability?
Joe's a Florida fave, is recreated on the strip.  Excellent steak and seafood with family style a la carte sides.  Runs $50+ per person with wine and sides.  You do need to be aware that everthing is a la carte and that prices are high.  The food quality is consistently excellent as is normal for Joe's.  The atmosphere is steakhouse elegant and relatively quiet.  Very nice dining experience and would definitely recommend!
All I can say is wow. Stone crabs are the bomb. My first stone crab experience did not disappoint. It had the familiar flavor of crab and yet there subtle wonderful new flavors. Crab lovers must try thus. Also had the Manhattan style clam chowder. The acidity of the tomatoes in the chowder was delightful. Also had a chopped salad which served as the perfect acid component to our rich meal. Will be back soon.
Visited late August for dinner party of 3. This place is classy with higher-end clientele and very attentive staff. . . The seafood at Joe's is ABSOLUTELY delicious. I ordered a grilled seafood platter which is was part of a special menu for restaurant week. I really hope they do start offering this on their regular menu because if was one of freshest and tastiest seafood platters I have had in Las Vegas. I would have taken a picture of it for you all, but I got completely distracted by the delicious aromas emanating from my platter and before you know it, it was all gone!!!. . Our server Bill was very nice, extra attentive to all our need and a class act.. . Overall Joe's is a classy restaurant with a cool vibe and most importantly, with top quality seafood.. . We will definitely be back to try some of their other items on the menu.
Absolutely wonderful meal. Staff is attentive, knowledgeable, courteous.. Our group had crab cake appetizer, chopped salad, ribeye steak and broiled mahi mahi, Asiago mashed potatoes, green beans with almonds, key lime pie and chocolate fudge cake. . The steaks were tender and perfectly cooked. The seafood was fresh and melt in your mouth delicious. The sides were generous and our party of 4 was good with half-orders. Dessert was worth the calories.. Dinner here was a home run and will definitely plan to return here on the next trip.
By far the best bone in ribeye i have ever eaten. The service was incredible. Ask for Hope she is the best. The stone crab is absolutely a must eat. The best dining experience on the strip. If your torn between places to eat when visiting Vegas this it's the place to go. You will absolutely not regret it
Excellent service! The staff here should be what all other staff aspire to be in regards to customer service. I cannot speak highly enough about their level of professionalism and attention to detail.. . Now, on to the food - le sigh - I dream of their stone crab, filet mignon and delicious bread.. and the sauteed spinach and garlic... swoon! . . All I can say is - GO! Make it your one super fancy meal while you're in Vegas - just don't leave Vegas without checking this place out.  You will not regret it!
We had eaten at the one in Miami and Chicago.  Great food great experience.   So we expected the same quality at the Vegas location especially considering the fact you are spending at least $100-125 per person for your meal.   This is a very expensive restaurant in Vegas so get ready.  We both had their surf and turf special and the filet was dry and flavorless even though it was medium rare. (and choice not prime) The fish portion was good but small.  The corn special was pretty good as was the bread.  The salad was ok nothing special.   I would not go back as there are many other good steak or seafood places that are not that expensive.
Perfect, evarything was PERFECT! Friendly staff, on top of every detail. We ordered several appetizers, all of which were delish. I went with the King crab legs which come split and open, large and meaty. There were 5 people in my party and everyone was pleased with their food. Prices are on par with level of service and food quality. I highly recommend, this is some of the best seafood I have had in Vegas.
Yum! I was in town for a food expo and went with my co-workers who included some top of the line renowned chefs. They being chefs of course wanted to critique a few items especially the dessert, which I would have to agree with! But other then the desserts, the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms, Ahi Tuna Tartare, Stone Crab, Jumbo Alaskan Sea Crab, Chilean Sea Bass, New York Strip and Rib Eye did not disappoint our palettes. Yes I tried all of that happily and would do it again & again minus dessert here.
Always excellent... Bone in filet or Chilean Sea Bass are our favorites.  Excellent service (thanks William Turner!).  Great place overall...particularly for special occasions.
Loved Joe's Stone Crab.  Service was terrific, staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and fun.
Found this place thru Google search and this place was by far the best review for steak and seafood. I wanted to take my bf out for a nice bday dinner while visiting Vegas. So I made us an apt. We arrived on time and table was ready for us. The service was phenomenal! Food was amazing! My bf and I ordered the filet and Alaskan crab.  It just melts in ur mouth! Amazing!  A little pricy but it was all worth it. My bf and I enjoyed our time here and would definitely come back here!
this place is worth going to! we had the best waiter name john. he was so friendly, attentive and knowledgeable! great service! the food was amazing and i would definitely come back again. it was a little pricey but worth it, you got a lot of food for the cost.
Wanted to have one nice dinner in Vegas and Joe's was the perfect place. Most customers eating here are dressed for the occasion but there were a few just wearing casual clothes. The ambience in the room was really nice. It is dimly lit with music playing lightly.  Our waiter was very friendly and talked just about anything that came to mind. For appetizers we got the fried calamari, crab cakes and crab bisque. Everything came out delicious especially the crab cakes which had a ton of crab in there so I would recommend it. I got the Chilean sea bass as my main dish. It was good except the miso sometimes overpowered the fish and it made me wish they added a little less.  I really liked the bread bowl that came out with all kinds of bread. Did not have enough room for dessert because we ordered too much.
King Crab appetizer, prime bone in strip, sweet potato and sweet roasted corn.  I should have stopped but.... Banana Foster pie (made fresh at Joe's).  It was amazing as always!!
It's times like these when I truly enjoy writing a deserved review on a restaurant. We had actually planned to go to a crawfish place for dinner, but I really wanted to try something else for once...since we always go to the crawfish place when we come to Vegas.. . My first impression when walking toward this restaurant was....wow....this place looks really expensive, so it better be good! Located in the Forum Shopping mall at Caesar's, the restaurant looks like a long and well established classic American bar and restaurant. We were greeted at the entrance by a host who seated us right away....likely because we showed up early at around 5.30pm....but even then, the place was very busy. We were led to our table where we were introduced to our waiter ITodd) who took very good care of us. Both the host and Todd were extremely polite and nice, courteous, and professional, and made us feel like the most important guests at the restaurant.....real class.. . In less than a minute, a fresh basket of yummy bread was placed on our table....and it looked gooooood! ....and after tasting it....wow, delicious. Todd then came over and showed us the menu with the featured specials, which all sounded absolutely amazing.  Everything on main menu looked absolutely delicious, but we couldn't order everything that looked good as we would not have been able to finish it all.....so we were very selective. As an appetizer we ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms.... and OMG,...they were absolutely delicious! I can quite confidently say without a doubt that these were the best I have ever tasted! Next, how could we have come to Joe's without trying their 5-piece signature Stone Crabs Claws. Also absolutely delicious....and together with their special dipping sauce.....absolutely fantastic! $65 for 5 claws.....well, it better have been good! Already cracked, Todd was good enough to instruct us how they are supposed to be peeled and eaten....and afterwards, brought us some lemon to squeeze on our hands and wet towels to clean our hands of the fishy crab smell. And it actually worked!. . For our entrees, we ordered their featured special grilled Dover Sole, which was de-boned at table side. Simply squeezed lemon on top and you have one absolutely delicious fish meal. For myself, I ordered the Roasted Black Cod as this is one of my favorite types of fish. It was cooked and served in a mild tomato broth with olives and herb oil. The cod was so fresh and perfectly cooked.....and the broth was mild enough as to no way overpower the fish.....every part of this dish complimented each other.....I absolutely loved it.....I thought the portion was a bit small, so thank goodness my friends and I shared everything. For sides, we ordered the Sauteed Broccolini and highly recommended Roasted Swee Corn. Both were also perfectly cooked and delicious. The serving of corn was good, but I think there should have been a bit more Broccolini in the dish.. . All this together with a bottle of wine......wow.....life is good....and this restaurant qualifies as being one of the best restaurants I have ever tried! The service was excellent and attentive, and I will say that it was worth every dollar we spent on this dinner. I will definitely be back when I'm next in town. Oh, we were brought the wrong check, but it's a good thing we normally check everything before paying.. . I love this place! :)
Mmmmmm! Best filet and king crab dish.  My husband likes their oysters. Cannot go wrong when dining here!  Not crazy expensive either for fine dining.
