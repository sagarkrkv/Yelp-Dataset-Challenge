This is my first time staying at the Flamingo and I like it for the most part.  The room is really nice.  We booked the basic king but then upgraded to the next level of king room (higher floor, view, updated room) for $20 and I think it was definitely worth it.  Pillow top bed, nice comforter (not those old fashioned quilts), updated bathroom with a huge shower and great view.  The staff is also friendly.  The front desk agent was pretty nice as was the Total Rewards agent.  Everyone you pass in the hall always says hello and smiles, which is nice to see.  The food at the pool is surprisingly good and the drinks aren't weak.  The pool is crowded as others have said but you can find chairs if you search around or if you go to the smaller pool above the Go Pool.   The waterfalls in the Go Pool are awesome and so much fun.  The only real cons are: Buffet is terrible, service at buffet isn't great, and they only include one device for internet per day with the resort fee.  If you want others on wifi, you have to pay $14-30 a day/device.  This seems astronomical and kind of defeats the purpose of an inexpensive room.  It's not a huge deal but also the AT&T reception in the room is bad so if you need to rely on cell reception to be online you might not like the wifi policy here.  That said, the room is super quiet and kind of like a cocoon so if you are looking to have a nice room to relax in, get some sun, and be close to other things on the strip, this is a good place (and the birds/flamingos are cute!).
Stayed here over Labor Day Weekend in a Fab Deluxe room. Overall a good place to crash. The rooms were clean. It seemed that they did some remodeling but didn't go all the way with it. All the bathroom fixtures seemed like they were original. Dated tiling in the bathroom but it did have an updated large granite counter top. The room itself had some kind of hard wood flooring, I liked it because carpets tend to stain and who knows what gets trapped in the fibers. The first night we got stuck in room 10150, everything about the room was great, except the music coming from the Linq walkway. There was loud music blasting all night and day. The worst part of this was that I could hear two different songs at the same time, from the bars in the walkway. This was intolerable and we got moved to another room, facing the opposite side, into the Flamingo courtyard. Overall I would stay here again because of the convenient location and sufficient rooms.
The Flamingo is home to some of the best shows in all of Las Vegas. I love their intimate show room, and they are in a GREAT location on the strip. However, the hotel itself was disappointing. The room was in serious need of repairs, I had a giant hole in the ceilings of the shower and absolutely no hot water or water pressure. I told management about the issues but they were dismissive. Internet is also not included in the resort fees, it's a additional $24 per day per device. To me that wouldn't be a big deal as my phone has it's own hot spot but somehow I think the hotel has a way to block the connection as it didn't work at all. Lastly, I reported a case of theft to management. Management said they would have security come to my room to file a report, nobody ever came.
Stayed here 5 years ago, and liked it although could use some upgrades. Stayed recently and rooms are upgraded, look a lot nice.  Would be nice if they upgraded to carpet in the hallway as well.  Casino area not the best, seen better games elsewhere.  Best location on the strip (right in the middle).
Very nice room, decent restroom, good staff. Great pool with good music. Room was on the 14th floor only complaint was that the ice maker didn't work. Other then that the stay was great.
This is our favorite casino. An excellent location with friendly dealers, and good payouts. Lots of fun happening everywhere like dancing girls on platforms. Masseuses roam and massage your shoulders while you play. The rooms are very nice too. The buffet is decent. Some older decor but they put the value in the room, employees, and casino.
It's a landmark. One of the originals of sin city. Otherwise there are many places better. But, cool to see.
We stayed here for our trip to Las Vegas. The people were nice and very sincere. I wouldn't change this hotel for anything. The pool there is to die for. Just think. An all adult pool with stipper pools and cabanas? Who wouldn't like that with free cocktails!
If I could rate this hotel 0 stars I would. I do not feel safe here security and evacuation procedures are not in place. On Monday September 8th around 4:15 on the 28th floor the fire alarm went off. After trying to call the front desk (got put on hold) we got dressed and left our room about 5 minuets later and ran into a frantic woman in the hallway with no idea what to do. We proceeded to head down the stairs (which were not labeled well very small exit sign. There was no alarm in the stair well, no signage for emergency procedure and no way to know what was going on. No security in the stair well, nothing. Once we got down to the 2nd floor we hit a dead end there was a locked door and one that led to a roof again not very much signage, yellow arrows on the ground not very visible with the 2in of rain flooding the roof. After much confusion we reached another stair well and got outside. We got downstairs and the first 3 hotel employees we spoke with had no idea there was an alarm going off. This includes a hotel manager. She offered to change our rooms gave us $50 to spend at the hotel and passed us off to another front desks assistant Melinda who was very nice and undertaking. After continuing to voice our concern, worry and still shaking she informed us that it was a false alarm (which we would have known if there were alarms and speakers in the stairs). We asked to speak to a manager again because the first woman had gone home. This is when things took a turn for the worse. Ryan Ramsey came our flat faced and dry nodding quietly to my friends concerns only escalating our frustration. He interrupted her, told her we weren't getting an upgrade and said he didn't know what else to do, it wasn't his fault there weren't enough security guards. We were trying to voice our concern about security procedures and he made us feel stupid. He didn't smile apologize or even try to de escalate the situation he gladly handed over his "managers" business card and seemed glad to pass the burden along. All we were trying to do is show our perspective in the faults in security and emergency procedures at the hotel and he didn't seem to care. The bell hop and house keeping manager we dealt with were very nice and understanding. Obviously this hotel is not equipped for any sort of emergency situation I no longer feel safe staying here and after multiple calls and attempts at voicing our concerns yelp is the only place we can be heard.
TOP FLOOR ROOMS NOT SAFE DURING HEAVY RAIN!  Rude front desk that doesn't care about guest safety. . . We were staying on the 28th floor.  It was raining and there where some leaks in the hall.  All of the sudden the alarm goes off- we wait for a while- it is still going off.  We head into the hall to see if anyone can tell is what is going on.  We see a panicked woman visiting the US for Austrailia.  She is scared and so we headed down the fire escape.  About the 14th floor we couldn't hear the sirens so we exited the stairwell and we could still hear the alarm.  We didn't know if the elevators were safe.  The fire exit path was not marked as you headed out to the roof over the casino so we had to try several doors at each turn.  We finally get into the hotel and no one knows what we are talking about.  We are told to go to the front desk. . . At the front desk we hailed a manager.  Our Australian women was still shaking so I went and got her a chair from the Casino.  It was right at shift change so the first manager told us it was a false alarm and we would be moved.   She passed us off to Mildred.  She was nice.  We were downgraded rooms in the move so we asked for a manager.  . . Ryan Ramsey came up.  He offered to comp our night for tonight.  When we asked about the fire escape not being marked he just said "what do you want me to do?"  When we asked if it was the same kind of room and he said since we didn't pay for the upgrade we weren't entitled to any else.  We said we were very scared and upset he smirked and told us "I don't know what you want me to do..."  . . We asked why no one- even the front desk manager knew about the alarm as they could be checking people into unsafe rooms.  He said they had already stopped checking people into those rooms because of the leaks.   We asked why we had t been called with an offer to move- he said "we just don't do that". . We asked to speak to his manager.  He said there was no one we could talk to.  That there was no one there higher up than him.  If we wanted to complain we had to email the vp of operations.  We questioned that there was no management level between him and her and he said no.  . . At this point now were are furious- he says something like "I comped you for tonight I don't know what you want me to do". He was INCREDIBLY condescending.  He also told us how frustrated he was because he just got here and he got this problem thrown at us.  We tried to ask him if he was frustrated how did he think we felt.  He didn't care.  . . We went upstairs and the bellman was not there because we hadn't gotten back from the front desk.  Honestly at this point we were a little scared and just wanted out of the room.  We called another bellman and shoved everything into bags as fast as we could.  We warned a few guests that the alarm had gone off and there where leaks in our rooms.. . I got a call from Raina who said Ryan had said that there was a problem.  I told her my problems and she did apologize. . . I have never been treated like this before.
Had a guys weekend trip and we shared a deluxe fab room with two queen beds. The room was nice and beds were soft. The view wasn't great but we were in the room about 15 hours over three nights so a view isn't required. Staff were nice. I recommend bringing an extension cord since its an older hotel their are no plugins accessible by the bed.
Just to be polite, there are so many choices in Las Vegas...choose something else!!!!
Go here every time we are in Vegas, clean and well kept, staff is always ontop of things, only thing missing is they could use a few better restaurants, beds are great
I have been staying at the Flamingo every year for the passed 8 years. Just got home from a long weekend this Sunday. The Go Room's are the best bet, but I have to say  I reserved a GO Room 1 king bed and we were placed in the wrong room at the time of checking in. I had to wait a night to switch rooms (not cool). The newer Go Rooms are looking dingy/not cleaned. The wallpaper is coming off the wall's. The coffee shop line in the morning is out of control 45 minute wait for a cup of Joe. The Pool is great if you can get a chair. You have to be down there at 8am and wait an hour for it to open. People hold chairs all morning/afternoon that are not even at the pool. No free internet for hotel guest. The gift shop prices are out of hand. Sad to say that was my last stay at the Flamingo
I was extremely disappointed with the quality of service from the check-in desk. Waited in line for over an hour to be told I could not check in yet.
Our room was dirty, smelled of smoke though it is supposedly nonsmoking, and smelled of urine.
**This is not a review for the hotel, but for the kiosk by Wyndham located near the flamingos**. . My fiance and I  came inside wanting to look around, and were accosted by men who basically pushed us toward a booth. We kept telling the guy we weren't interested, but I guess we should've been more rude, as the man behind the counter for Wyndham wouldn't shut up. Not only did he waste our time when we kept saying we wanted to leave (we didn't want to walk away mid-sentence) but then he also was EXTREMELY RUDE to us when I said we wouldn't be buying any extra tickets, timeshares, or anything else from him. Wyndham needs to change their staff, and when someone says No, they mean no. There's also no need to be rude to your customers--what if, on the offchance, we changed ourminds and wanted to go back even though we said No the first time? Obviously, we wouldn't return to that counter, or deal with the man ever again. Bad customer service.
This will be short sweet and to the point I'm sorry I will stay at the best Western on the strip next time instead of the flamingo.  The waitress absolutely assholes when you ask to break money so you can tip them never seen someone bitching about free money.  Keep making tips acting like that.  And sec are you kidding me.  The rooms freaking suck what a waste of money and time here.  I went to the other hotels and was treated how I expected.  And I wasn't even staying there.  All I have to say is don't go here its absolutely horrible I'm not coming back ever.  I'll go stay somewhere else
I'm so disappointed!!!! I came with a person that was visiting USA and wanted to stay in one of the older casinos, but I was very disappointed. The bathroom were moldy and dirty. TV had bad reception,  and the whole 4th floor smelled like poop including our rooms!!!! I'm glad I only booked one night!!! And when I went to bell desk to rent a motorized wheelchair- lady asked me: "like the one for old people?" My reply was "yes like old people, can I have one of those?" It made me feel very bad since I'm only 27 and I hurt my back long ago and can't walk much at all - she had no right to implement it was made for old people only !!!! This made my trip very bad:(
This was my first time staying at the flamingo. I was nice enough to rate this hotel a two star only because the housekeeping staff was the best thing on this resort.. Originally we we're staying at the Venetian (hands down the best high secured hotel on the strip) however, last minute bookings we missed out on a room big enough for 5 people. Fight weekend lots of hotels booked.. Driving up you could already tell it is OLD. Walking in same feeling. Walking through to get to our building ( the habitat tower) I didn't expect anything but slots machines and gambling tables. Duh it's Vegas. The habitat tower has not been renovated! The carpets in the halls were stained and looked like that have never been changed. Our room a two queen bed room had out dated lamps (never been dusted) literally took my finger and wiped off dust from the bottom of the lamp. Our view was horrible overlooking the resorts mechanical things (not sure what's it called). The beds had no comforters just some ugly fur thing big enough to cover your feet. The bathroom was the worst. Shower curtain too long for the shower rail many times got wet! The toilet and vanity were so old that the paint on the vanity looked like someone was sanding it and forgot to repaint it.. The restaurant that serves breakfast their staff were rude and not very nice. Maybe it was too early in the morning and who knows what ass hole pist them off before we got seated but other then food being very yummy and satisfying that's all I have to say about that.. The pool gets crowded quickly! Great dj and fun atmosphere. Bartenders hook you up if you hook them up with a GREAT tip! Don't be cheap people. However, for my friends and I this past weekend was one that we will never forget. While in the pool we noticed a male turned over in the pool like if he was playing dead. After a few minutes some of the swimmers near him noticed he wasn't playing dead. He basically drowned and my friend had along with about 5 other guys help push him out of the water into the deck. Lifeguards and no clue what to do. Some other girl began to give him CPR. The man came back and began to have what seems to have been a seizure. I jumped in since I'm CPR/first aid certified to grab his tongue and no one would listen to me. He bit his tongue badly and bleed all over the pool deck. EMS finally got there after 15 minutes and I think his fine.. All and all I know you don't go to Vegas to sleep however, when you are enjoying the resort it shouldn't feel like this. Just saying. And it's still expensive so don't do it.
Multiple trips to date for the hotel. Once last year and once this year. Visits left a variable unfavorable hotel and casino impression.. . Located in the center of the Las Vegas strip. One of the original casino and hotels. Mostly remodeled rooms with dark colored hardwood floors. Beds are decently maintained.. . First visit last year, we stayed during spring break. Management and counter staff were both uncoordinated to handle the volume of people in line. Wait time was about a good hour from back to front for the players line or just hotel guest line. At one point the management had pulled me to the side to try out the self check in only to say I had to go back into the line. Fortunately enough the person I was in front of let me back into the line.. . My room preference (king nonsmoking) was unavailable when I got to the check in after staying at another casino hotel the night before without having my nonsmoking preference available. Offered two queens nonsmoking we gladly accepted. Room was nicely furnished with pink fur, pillows, a nice little split love seat chairs. Bathroom was properly sized and decently maintained. The room was quite nice for what I expected to  find and sitting in front of the strip. Room was kept nicely by the hotel housekeeping. Only downside to the view and room was the large Donnie and Marie advertising that was outside obstructed the view of Caesar and the strip.. . We received our bill the last morning to encounter an issue with billing. We waited in the hotel line again to get the issue resolved. Another good 15 minutes to check out. We had to catch our shuttle and correcting the billing was a contributing factor for is to miss our shuttle. We asked the hotel staff regarding catching the shuttle to which we purchased a round trip to where we would go. The staff was unsure. The long line with the lack of clarity between the staff was not a good lasting impression. Although not favorable on service I was willing to give it another try recently. . . Recent visit in July, I wanted to see if I could check in before normal time of 4. I didn't want to pay the extra for the early check in (breakfast time) but willing to pay for the room upgrade. We waited in line and this time was significantly faster but still about 15 minutes. Neither of my requests could be accommodated and was told to try back a little after lunch from the clerk and her supervisor. We wait again in the line and at the time we were told to check back again. This time another half hour of my time. Again I could not check in. We had already eaten lunch and breakfast by this time. We were told to check in an hour and decided to just wait for regular check in at this point. We come back go check in at 4. Waited another 15 minutes in line to get room keys and everything settled. So for check in here expect to wait about one hour.. . Room this recent trip was not nearly as maintained. It looked like the room itself was half updated and the casino hotel ran out of money to fix it up. The room was comfortable but decor appeared to be mismatched from the tables and the bed. This recent trip we cut short and checked out a day early. Again check out took about 15 minutes.. . Water and room temperatures were okay. Towels and sheets were cleaned and stocked. . . The decor and upkeep on the hotel was a mixed bag. Service is incredibly slow on the hotel front desk.. . Casino is also not kept well. Considering the age and the keep of the room, an update is needed on both. Machines are tight and table dealers are not friendly or helpful. . . Overall I have to drop what would be a two star for a one time visit. Second trips usually confirm assessments. In this case, one star unlikely to be out here to stay the night or gamble. I'll take my business elsewhere.
I recently stay at the flamingo and it was awful. Awful customer service. Just absolute crap! Don't stay at this hotel!!!!!
I read an article about Ceasar's entertainment being 20B+ in debt. Yes, that is a "B" as in billion. I wondered, how is it that they are so deep in sh*t? A few nights at the Flamingo would have any customer putting the nails in the coffin for CZR. . . I know Flamingo is one of the older, cheaper, discount hotels on the strip, but I could not have predicted how dire the situation here was. Had I not had my rooms next to everyone else in the company, I would have left and rebooked elsewhere.. . Location: 1 star for location. It's the Las Vegas Strip and its next to Drai's newest series of clubs @ the Cromwell (which is owned by Ceasars). . . Rooms: -3 stars. Rooms are clearly outdated. I felt uncomfortable lying in my bed for fear that it had not been clean. My fears of unclean rooms were reinforced by the cockroaches that crawled up my bathroom windows as I washed up in the morning. The bathroom vent next to the old shower and musty shower curtains were also filled with lint. Even if I had wanted to get sleep in the bed, the music from 8 floors below was blaring through the window into my room. I figured it would stop at 4am. Nope. Guests lucky enough to enjoy people watching those in the new Linq outdoors area are also blessed with 24 hours of live music ranging from Ke$ha to all your favorite edm tracks keeping you up all day/night.. . Service: -1 star. I asked to change rooms for only a few hours because by the second night I was dead tired and desperately needed sleep. After being redirected twice, I was told they were sold out and couldn't do anything about it. Thank God for Bose QC15 headphones I have otherwise I may have slept in the bathroom.. . Food options: You have a Mexican cafe that services a decent breakfast, a food court with Johnny Rockets open very late at night, some bad Chinese place, a bad pizza place, and a bad subs restaurant. But food isn't really a reason anyone stays here anyways. . . Never staying here again. Good luck to all employees here, I wish you the best on your future job searches.
After an awesome girls trip, I wanted to say thank you. Our cabana and the service we received at the pool were absolutely fantastic and worth every penny.   The hotel could learn a thing or two from the staff running the Go Pool.   . . I'd also like to thank you for charging me $20 for early check in to a room that wasn't cleaned, and the response of "well go ask the desk for another room," when we interrupted 4 housekeepers on their union break in the hall for help.  When we responded that changing rooms wasn't an option, as we had SIX rooms together, they begrudgingly cleaned our room, while fighting in front of us over who should be doing it.   . . Oh, and the valet when we asked for 2 taxis! I love that he berated me in front of my friends and other guests when I declined his offer of a limo. His customer service was top notch!  Do all of your valets have their hands in limo pockets?  . . Carlos & Charlie's was a blast too! $15 cover charge, and last call given as soon as we walk in. Sorry, no refunds!  $75 for 5 minutes of fun!  . . I've stayed at The Flamingo several times, and it was better when it was just an old, out dated, strip hotel. Here's a little tip, Flamingo: you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. If you want your hotel/casino to be big & bright and able to compete with the other, bigger hotels on the strip, get your staff together. Bright pink rooms are great, but they turn grey when your staff is ugly. Next time we're going back to Mandalay Bay. Thanks for making the decision easy for us.
I'm so disappointed!!!! I came with a person that was visiting USA and wanted to stay in one of the older casinos, but I was very disappointed. The bathroom were moldy and dirty, fan  not working. Bathroom was so small that each time I trod to close the door I would hit myself. TV had bad reception, and was very small. The room was very basic. Didn't even have alarm clock!!! Only telephone and envelope for tip for housekeeping!!! The whole 4th floor smelled like poop including our rooms!!!! I'm glad I only booked one night!!! And when I went to bell desk to rent a motorized wheelchair- lady asked me: "like the one for old people?" My reply was "yes like old people, can I have one of those?" It made me feel very bad since I'm only 27 and I hurt my back long ago and can't walk much at all - she had no right to implement that motorized wheelchairs were  made for old people only !!!! This made my trip very bad:(
Disappointing!! DO NOT BOOK IT! There are SUPER loud bars right under the rooms! I asked the front desk if we could change a room because it was too loud and impossible to fall asleep. the woman of the front desk went to talk to the manager, when she came back, she directly said no, all rooms were booked. She said it even without checking with her computer! They just didn't want to change the room for us. While we were arguing, the woman kept whispering with the other one, smiling ironically, they were so rude and totally destroyed the reputation of the hotel. Also I highly doubted this room was supposed to belong to someone else who had changed to another room because when I got in, there was a used soap on the table, and the blanket of my bed was lying on the sofa!! If you are willing to pay $200 for being awake the whole night, go ahead and book!
It was okay, nice garden, pool, wedding ceremony was cute. But our family stayed on the same floor and we all found a roach in all of our rooms. So it was gross and we had a leaky bath tub that wouldn't stop. But that's about it.
Ahhh The Flamingo Hotel, Las Vegas.  First time here, will probably be the last and let me tell you why:. . 1. The car park is around the back of the hotel, with no front entrance that I saw.  Given the huge increase in LV traffic, good luck in finding the parking garage if you get stuck on the strip.  Do what I did: turn right onto Flamingo Blvd. and then cut across 5 lanes of traffic into The Cromwell's parking garage and, from there, cut a sharp left into a back alley, and drive until you find (accidentally, completely by chance) the back entrance to the Flamingo's parking garage.  Extra points if you do NOT get a ticket, hit a taxi or drive the wrong way down a one way street. Of course, now that I've been to the Flamingo, I know the score.   Grade: D.. . 2.  Arrive at check in, after a long car drive, and be greeted by the biggest A$$hole the Flamingo's HR department could find.  Benjamin the desk clerk, a short, chubby, balding, snippy jerk with darting reptilian eyes, will make you feel super welcome and not at all turned off by his bitchy behavior.  If you're lucky, he might even condescendingly insult members of your party too! Right to their faces!!  Although I would have to say that Benjamin's the lucky one here ..... the men in the party wanted to kick him in the nuts.... but I wouldn't let them.  I will, however, say that the next two desk clerks I dealt with were both very nice ladies.  Benjamin, however, succeeded grandly in angering 2 members of our party which basically put a damper on the entire 3 days we stayed .... initially, people wanted to immediately go find another room in another hotel but that wasn't possible.  Thanks solely to Benjamin, I give the check in process a ...... Grade: F.  Thanks to you, "Ben", we probably will never return.. . 3.  ROOM PROS: The bathtub drained well.  Plenty of towels and supplies.  Strong water pressure, painful like a fire hose.  Comfortable beds made up with decent sheets, etc.  Hardly heard any noise from adjoining rooms which was nice ..... no flushing toilets, running water, stomping, yelling, etc.  Great mirror coverage in the bathroom ..... big mirror above the sink, fabulous full length wide mirror on the far end bathroom wall.  Very comfortable air conditioning ..... breezy.. . ROOM CONS:  Our rooms were dirty.  I can say with certainty, the floor probably wasn't vacuumed properly or mopped for at least 2 weeks.  Lots of dust and hair on the floors, behind the TV cabinet, desk and armchair ..... floor was quite grotty in fact.  Rug, although grey and black, was obviously stained and grubby.  Bathrooms in dire need of an upgrade ....... above our bath was a metal rusty stained trap door of sorts .....hardly up market.  Lousy free TV selection.  Lampshades with big holes in them.. . 4.  Very expensive snack shops ..... you will pay $4 for a can of Coors and $3.50 for a bottle of water.  Elsewhere in the hotel, I paid $6 for a can of Coors.. . 5.  Crappy pool ..... it's a trek to get there too, at least from where Benjamin put us, way the heck back in the hotel with nothing but a brick wall for a view.  Grade: D. . 6.  Elevators that kept breaking down.  On the occasions that we actually stepped into an elevator without a maintenance man in it, the sounds coming from the elevator shaft were enough to bring on panic attacks and sudden frights.  The last thing I want to hear while riding an elevator is loud CLANGS, THUDS and other strange noises. Everyone riding with us was freaking out.  Grade: F. . CONCLUSION: I wanted a hotel right in the middle of the strip for a decent rate.  I got the location, and I paid around $70/night per room.  I wasn't expecting decadent luxury but I DO expect a clean room and a nice bathroom.  The Flamingo gives off an old and tired vibe ...... dentures and stale cigarette smoke sort of vibe.  I guess I can live with that but I CAN'T live with rude A$$hole customer 'service'.  Benjamin really did ruin our first night in Vegas with his nasty manner because it was so unexpected.  Dude, if you hate your job that much, LEAVE.  No one will miss you.  And, solely because of you, my next trip to Vegas will be spent at either The Cromwell, Harrah's, Paris or Planet Hollywood.. . OVERALL GRADE: 5 OUT OF 10
Sale,  vieux, moche, une queue de 50 metres pour faire le checkout, bruyant,  une tres mauvaise affaire meme pour Las Vegas
Wow this is an old hotel that they have tried to update but not successfully. The beds are very comfortable, pillows are HORRIBLE, not enough outlet to charge devices. . . The checkin was an hour + wait. It's clear management does not care because the staff does not care. No one working for the hotel seem nice or customer service oriented. The food was horrible don't eat there.  Parking is on the opposite end of everything and very hard to access. . I will not be staying here again for any reason given the price vs quality. Although it is well situated on the strip.
Stayed there recently, very disappointed in the conditions of the maintenance, particularly on our floor. Room smelled like cigarette smoke, the hallway on our floor and major ripples in it and tear in the rug.  The only positive thing was the strip view. Maid service cut corners at times. Won't be staying here again.
My friend stayed here five years ago while the Flamingo was undergoing renovation. I don't really see much of a difference. The pool back then was pretty terrible but my friends vouched for the pool and said they think the renovations must have gone to the pool. . . Here are a couple of our observations we experienced during our weekend stay:. . - Guests like signs to help us find where to go and where things are. So the ice machine wasn't where the sign said it was and it led to a mini expedition. . . - Guests like the cold. If you're in the desert, don't you think each room should have a mini fridge? Especially since you can't find the ice machine? . . - Guests like service. We called for additional towels. It took an hour and we had forgotten that we requested for them. Also, another hotel guest ordered room service in our hallway. An entire day passed where the trays in the hallway hadn't been picked up.    . . - Guests like a clean-looking hotel. The carpet was stained and needs replacing - wouldn't you think that's an important part of renovating? The crown molding was coming apart in the hallway. . . - Guests don't like to imagine getting shanked. These hotel elevators looked like they belonged in a shady parking garage where a drug bust would go down. I'd rather ride the Tower of Terror. We thought that the elevators in the parking structure were bad enough but those in the hotel were out of East Los.. . No WiFi. Wasn't a fan of the conditioner/shampoo. The TV could have been bigger but at least there was one. Not all the outlets had socket covers. . . Your fire alarm works. The fire alarm notification went off at the wee hours of the morning. We get that this is protocol but is it necessary to notify us half a dozen times? Just when you are drifting back to sleep, it would start up again. Perhaps it's the due diligence in trying to notify people hard of hearing because the side effect was waking everyone up from a somewhat drunken slumber. . . It helped that the location on the strip was excellent but for $75 a night, my friends and I set our expectations low. You get what you pay for. We got a bed to sleep on. It was a last minute trip so we went with price.
We stayed in room 17138 in late September 2014. The only reason I did not give them a 5 is because it wasn't perfect and I didn't want to mislead readers.. We did the online early check in. It costs 30.00 to check in early but well worth it because we got in immediately thanks to a great customer service person at the check in counter.  Her name was Shawn and she did a great job of making check in easy. . The room itself gave us a nice view of Caesars palace and a bit of Quad activity. floor to ceiling windows. There was a flat screen TV and a chaise lounge. It was clean, the furnishings are good but a bit dinged up..just showing a little age..it really was fine.The bed was comfy...The linens were average, I wish I had asked for more pillows though.  This room is a pretty good hike from the "Habitat Elevators" which are in the back of the property right by the habitat outside. this bank of elevators are great for the Linq access, this was handy for us.. The property has lots of dining options..(Center Cut steak house was great...reviewed separately).. Every service we used was great. The habitat is pretty and relaxing. Valet Was efficient.. Seriously there is very little to complain about.. Like I said, the property shows it's age but I would stay there again in an instant!!!!. We were comped but still had to pay the resort fee. However, the wifi ever failed me. . I'm very surprised how many poor reviews are here. It's not like you paid for the Wynne, it is what it is.
Horrible hotel... super rude @ check in. Rust in the bathroom.. tape on the ceiling!  discusting stains on the foot sheet on the bed. Spring extra and stay at the bellagio this hotel is awwwful!! Elevators made weird noises and felt un safe!
Check in is at 4pm. If you try to check in earlier it's a $20 fee. Good luck trying to get any sleep because this is the loudest hotel I have ever stayed in. The floors are fake wood and they echo really bad. The cleaning people are constantly slamming the doors in the hall all morning. And if you're put near the north side of the hotel by the Linq you'll hear music all night. The beds have scratchy comforters, and most of the hallways have a musty sort of smell to them. . . All that being said, the staff was friendly and The Flamingo is near most of the best hotels on the strip. But if the price of this hotel matches any others you're looking at, choose them.
The Good:. -I got a great rate on the room. - It has a central strip location. . The Bad:. - Self parking has 7 levels, but the elevator only goes to 6. The 7th has a very large deceiving sign with the word elevator on it. . - Their buffet is the worst I've ever seen at that price point. . - The carpet is bubbling in the hallways making a super long walk to the room even more difficult with rolling luggage. . - Staying in the 'Linq view ' rooms is a joke. Only a partial view and loud noise day and night. You can hear the Carnivale bar at Harrah's all night.. - Only 1 device per day is included with The Resort Fee. - The AC constantly reverts to auto. Meaning if you want the fan to run, you have to adjust it every 10 minutes when the system flips from on to Auto on its own. . . . The Ugly:. -I cut my toe on broken glass from a previous guest withinminutes of arriving in the room. It took an hour for them to send someone. I ended up asking a housekeeper to mop up the blood and potentially more glass. . - The elevators feel like death traps. No ac in them. Only one worked in the parking garage. They also lack the sensors to stop if someone is still in it.  I have the worst bruise(extremely painful) of my life trying to hold the door after letting people exit before getting on. . - The rooms with bathrooms that haven't been updated have mold and mildew covering the tiles and grout. . - Someone vomited in the hallway. It took 2 days to get it cleaned so you could no longer see that person's dinner. . . . All in all the place has potential but they miss the mark on execution.
FYI: If you have made a reservation online you don't have to wait on their very long check-in line. Trust me, you can go to the "High Roller" line.  It's shorter and for some reason 2 people are at the front desk. Quicker service!. . We stayed on the 19th floor, paid about $100/nt for the view of the High Roller, very pretty! You can also see the pool area and surrounding palm trees. Room was very clean when we first got there but within the 6 days I think they only swept the room once. The room was newly renovated, cute and chic with a lot of hot pink and black with modern wooden floors. (See pictures). . The bathroom? Not so much. It was clean but the ceiling was low and definitely looked dated, a little dingy but useable. . . Also, 2 employees randomly walked in while we were still in the room around 5pm without knocking and said they were doing their rounds of checking the rooms. Felt a little shady but thankfully nothing was stolen.
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #11:. inside, this place is average, probably 2.5 stars; the restaurants are very uninspired and behind Vegas standards; Margaritaville is huge & sprawling, with a casino of its own, but a total tourist trap; one thing this place has going for it (besides history) is the outdoor gardens - very unique & relaxing, including lots of birds (including flamingos, natch) & big fishies; there is also a sprawling 3rd floor maze of conference rooms; plus, the new Linq area of shops & restaurants next door is probably a good thing for The Flamingo, as it's the best place to park & walk through for access; best craft beer bet = well, the ex-Sin City Brewing Co. bar is now just a regular bar, but their beer selection is pretty decent, though dominated by IPA's; most of the little shops have a good variety of Rogue beers in bottles, surprisingly.
I'm less than amused; however, the extra star is for effort.. . I'm a Las Vegas local and was celebrating my 22nd birthday with a staycation.  I searched for a room that would fit my birthday party needs and wanted a cute room that I could walk to from serendipity and the Linq.  Let's face it - the Flamingo is one of the oldest hotels in Vegas.  But, I had recently heard that they remodeled some rooms.  I reserved a King GO room with a Strip View about a week in advance, the money was already taken from my account, and I became a Total Rewards member.. . Upon check in (exactly 4pm), I was told that the GO rooms were now all booked - though it was reserved and I had checked the moment it opened.  The woman GRACIOUSLY told me that I have been "upgraded" to a suite.  I assured her all I wanted was the pink bathroom.  But, once again I was told that they were completely booked.. . Whatever, I guess we'll take the suite then.  We headed up the elevator and I was positively offended when I walked in to this "upgrade".  This room was not a Vegas room.  I felt like I went to some small town and paid maybe $120 for it.  Maybe the elevator was a time machine back to the 1970's.  The furniture was dusty and the carpet had stains.  It didn't have a strip view.. I wouldn't sit on anything in there - and I swear I'm not a bitch.. I love camping, and this was dirtier than camping.. . My husband decided to call them and ask if we could get something a little closer to what we reserved, or at least closer to what we paid for.  They were gracious enough to give us keys to a different suite with a strip view.  Thankfully, the furniture was clean.  We decided that it was good enough and to make the best of it.. . Here's the best part : When they switched our room, I'm guessing no one switched our names in the computer.  Another couple was given keys to our room and waltzed right in while I was sleeping and my husband was in the shower.  AWESOME.  No one called to apologize nor ask if the room was better than the first.  I doubt this is how it goes every time, but unfortunately, that's how it went this time.. . Happy Birthday.. . P.S. There were about 6 channels on my TV... yay.
Ok so, there are definitely pros and cons about this place. We reserved a room but had to wait 3 hours after checking in to get there. The shower floor was sticky and the peep hole in the door had dirty toilet paper stuffed in it, which was gross. After complaining about it, they upgraded us. The upgrade was nice. We had a clean room with a mini fridge (not in the old room) and a couch ( also not in the old room). .      Here are the major things I liked about it: the staff were really friendly, the habitat animals were cool, the location was awesome, the pizza/ice cream place by the habitat elevators was delicious as well as the cafe right next to it. .       Things I didn't like: Carlos and Charley's had the WORST service I've ever experienced at a restaurant. Margaritaville was cheesy to me; just not my style. The slots were super tight. The elevators were terrible. I was bringing food for my whole party up to the 27th floor, and my hands were full. When somebody would get off the elevator, the selection of floors would be erased. And it happened at every floor. When I was I the elevator by myself, I had my hands full and couldn't hit a floor button. I got dropped off at the 12th, 20th and then back to the 14th floor before I could get up to the 27th...the shampoo/conditioner was lame but oh well! .    Other than that, not too bad if a time! Still enjoyed my stay in Las Vegas!
I would give 5 stars but have to subtract one because of the crappy elevators .....my husband and I stayed in the GO room and it was clean, beds very comfy, big bathroom,  great view of the strip.  The casino floor is laid out nice,  not a maze like Harrah's....fun atmosphere at the table games, LOVE Sye at 3 card poker and Ross at Texas Hold Em!! Love the flamingos habitat,  so beautiful and serene...Will definitely stay here from now on,  just wish they would put in new elevators.
