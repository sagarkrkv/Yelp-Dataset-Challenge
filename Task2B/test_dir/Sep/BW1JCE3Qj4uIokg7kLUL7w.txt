We had dinner here our first night in Vegas.  Prime time (7:00) but only a 10 minute wait. Restaurant is nice and open feeling.  Wide open to the MGM casino which was great for people watching. Food was very good. My wife has the spagetti and she was raving about it a few days later. I had soup and salad (I know, sort of odd) and it was great. The salad with the blue cheese dressing was one of the best I have ever had. Small but excellent.  Prices are about what you would expect. I think we spent about $75 for two which included one drink each.
Wonderful!! My shrimp were delicious. The texture was like a tender lobster. The roasted cauliflower was perfect too.  The prices were very reasonable especially for Vegas.
I know that Wolfgang's restaurants are very hit-or-miss, but I do find that the ones in Las Vegas are all quite reputable. This one located in the MGM just across from the KA Ticket office is excellent.. . Delicious and hearty American fare at reasonable prices (for the generous portions). We got the burger, pork belly sandwich, and a side of mac and cheese - for two people, we were stuffed and ended up bringing half of our dinner home for late night! The sandwiches were $17 each (but both had huge sides of fries or Greek macaroni salad) and the Mac n Cheese was $12. . . Service was top notch and continuously attentive. The ambiance is casual but still contemporary inside with an open-faced layout facing the casino outward. Great for dates, small groups, large groups, or just to get a bite to eat any time of the day. They are open daily until 5AM!
Didn't realize Wolfgang Puck had a place at the MGM until I walked right in front of it and decided we had to have a late lunch here: opted to share appetizers, a pizza, and a dessert. Pricing wasn't bad at all, casual style and cuisine.. . CRAB CAKE APPETIZER: Four small cakes, didn't hold up too well, plated with a tasty creole mustard remoulade. . . CHILI-GLAZED CHICKEN WINGS: Awkward pile of a portion, stacked like firewood on the plate. The wing I got looked like it came out of a lab and seemed to be a rib instead of a wing? Flavor of the glaze was light and wasn't spicy. . . PIZZA: Prosciutto, Kalamata Olives, Tomatoes, Basil Pesto, Goat Cheese. Crust was amazing, prosciutto was high quality, cheese and pesto were delicious. Felt like the kalamata olives didn't work with the other ingredients, made the overall flavor profile too salty for my liking. . . BEIGNETS: Large order of seven pieces, stuffed with a light lemon filling and served with a toffee-like dipping sauce. Flavors didn't work well together but pastry was light and well-constructed.. . Service and setting werealright- tables are quite small and even with just three of us, drinks, and a limited number of orders, things were crammed onto the table with barely enough room.  Plates weren't cleared when they were empty but instead had to be picked up when the next dishes were brought out, either poor timing or a lack of attention.
I have been staying at mgm grand since Sunday and I have to say if you are in Vegas and want to ensure you get a quality meal for the price then come here!  I have had quite a few items on the menu after experiencing terrible food elsewhere and everything was perfect! Dashi soup awesome! Chicken noodle? Incredible! I ate the chinois salad twice it was so goo! Burger? Yummy! And an incredible seasonal fish dish and creme brulee! Best part? Amazing service all around!
What an awesome experience this was! My boyfriend got the marinated steak strips with the mashed potatoes and I got their bolognese pasta. The marinade on the steak was AMAZING. I honestly could've eaten like 5 or more of those dishes and been perfectly fine for the rest of the evening. The service was very good, extremely attentive and always made sure we were satisfied with our meal.. . I will definitely be returning the next time I'm in town!
Pretty overpriced, but its getting hard to tell if that's just the Vegas thing, or because it's got Wolfgang's name attached to it. I say overpriced, but shockingly they also have one of the cheapest items around as well: their pizza. The pizza was ridiculously cheap compared to everything else, was under $20 and was more than enough for two people (we had a box to take the rest home).. . The people near us had a burger and steak, and neither seemed too happy with their choices. The burger was cooked beyond recognition, looked like a huge hunk of coal.. . Their pasta looked good, but not almost $30 a plate good.. . Oh, and our pizza was decent, a little plain though. The crust was ridiculously basic, no flavor or spices added to it, overall didn't have a ton of flavor, but if you're drunk or high I'm sure it tastes pretty good. Just don't order a soda or anything, they're like $5 each or some nonsense. Their wines start at like $70, so that was really off the list for us to try.
This place had the worst food I've had on my entire vacation.  It's basically an Applebee's for 3 times the price.  Service was crap, its loud, and the water has soap in it.  WTF Wolfgang?!
I would say this probably the best restaurant in mgm.  Who can say no to a 9 dollar orange juice fresh squeeze.  The burger was delicious and the pizza is it.  Have to disagree with the blue cheese truffle chips.  Unless you love blue cheese, I would skip it.   The blue cheese is just way to overpowering.
We go to Vegas once or twice a month and I always eat dinner at least once while we are there! The food and the service here just seems to get better & better! We love the marinated pork & the chicken! For the price this place can't be beat!
Very pleased! Staff was great! Food was great!. .  White Pizza was yum!!! Pancakes with Mascarpone was divine, Salad with cashews, steak, spinach, tuna tar tar. . I gave to say I enjoyed it all!!. . Felt like I came here every night hehe
This meal was ok. The steak had some grissle and it was just ok. I am kind of disappointed. It took forever to get the check and the the manager butted in during the close out of the check so it took even longer.
Service was friendly and delightful. Our server offered to do half portions for my soup and salad, which was perfect. My boyfriend had the breakfast sandwich, to which he added tomato and lettuce and, honestly, this might be the best breakfast sandwich of all time. The eggs were soft scrambled, the sausage was unbelievably good (made in house) and there was a wonderful remoulade style aioli on soft delicious bread. Can't say enough about it... really, the sandwich was incredible.
Sometimes it's the simple things.  You wander for miles on the Strip, need a sit-down, and want it to be a pleasant one.  That's what we got on a recent Saturday afternoon (before the big fight...they were busy!) Yet, we still were able to walk right in and plop down at the very busy bar.  . . Never once were we made to feel wrong for just wanting drinks. Husband really wanted some iced tea, and I was happy to have a nice Chardonnay.  (or two).  Reasonable prices.  Will say that ALL the food we saw get served around us looked awesome.  Had we not been full, we would have happily ordered more. Both of us were glad we picked this place to have an enjoyable refreshing sit-down!
