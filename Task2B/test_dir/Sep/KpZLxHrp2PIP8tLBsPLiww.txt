Solid 4 stars.  It's not the Four Seasons but it is very good. SHORT lines (or none at all) for checking in. This is rare in Vegas.  I have waited 30 minutes at other resorts. Rooms are very clean and modern. Not super luxurious but very nice all around. We had a one bedroom suite, on a holiday weekend, for under $200 a night.  They have good views (strip) and horrible views (airport) so if view matters to you ask about this. The only negative is it's not "on" the strip. It's a solid 5 minutes to get to the edge of the MGM property, through a long tunnel, and then a good 10 minutes to walk through the MGM to the strip.  So it's a walk but felt safe in the tunnel. Or you can walk the side street (Harmon) which is a shorter walk but sketchy at night.  We did the side street each for breakfast as it was much closer. For example, within 5-10 minutes you are inside the Planet Hollywood shopping mall and to me that's about the center of the strip. The Signature has pools if you like a quiet time (each tower has a pool). Or you can walk the 5 minutes to the MGM pool with the lazy river. That's what we did andit was great every day!  Five stars at the pool for sure!  The MGM itself has tons of restaurants, bars and of course huge casino.
This was an awesome hotel! We had a view of the airport and of the strip. Beautiful balcony, sitting area, two bathrooms, and a kitchen. Everything was very updated and modern. Only complaints were that it was a walk to the strip, but the monorail was in the MGM which is connected, so that wasn't bad. Also the pools were ridiculously crowded at the MGM. The Signature pool wasn't crowded, but it was just a pool, whereas the MGM's was a lazy river, volleyball and tons of pools. Also the business center was mega expensive. We just wanted to print our boarding passes and it would have cost at least $10. But other than that service was great, the rooms were clean and modern, and super spacious. We would go back for sure!!
***BEWARE OF BED BUGS AT SUITES IN SIGNATURE AT MGM GRAND!!!  DO NOT RECOMMEND BOOKING THROUGH LAS VEGAS SUITES!***. . I booked two luxury suites for my friend's bachelorette party.  We were more than excited as the price was reasonable and the suites included a lot of great amenities.  Everyone was more than happy with the rooms until my friend started getting hives the day after we arrived.  Since no one else in her room was immediately affected, we thought she was having an allergic reaction to something else.. . After the group departed Vegas and returned home, my friend confirmed with a doctor that her and her family members contracted bed bugs.  I immediately contacted Las Vegas Suites, who also confirmed the room waspositive for bed bugs.  In this type of situation, I would expect sincere apologies, great customer service, and ample compensation for damages.  However, I received none of the above.  I did not once receive an apology and I had to continue to follow-up to get in contact with someone here.. . I finally spoke to the general manager, Krystle, who explained the best they could do was credit me back $100.  $100 FROM A $2,800 BILL.  Clearly, this wasn't going to cut it so they offered me a total of $200...not so awesome.  I'm still working with them and now the Signature at MGM as to what they can do to help with this situation.  I hope the management at Signature at MGM will be better than the company I booked through and look into dropping Las Vegas Suites as a property management partner altogether.
*DO NOT BOOK THROUGH LUXURY SUITES INTERNATIONAL OR HOTELCLUB.COM!!!!*. . I liked the hotel and the SIGNATURE HOTEL STAFF very much, but dealing with LSI is making me rethink staying at this hotel again. . . I booked the hotel through hotelclub.com, and I had no idea that the room was booked through LSI, a third party. This was later disclosed to me by a very courteous SIGNATURE front desk staff when I tried to request early check-in. The front desk agent called LSI for me, as he could not help me, and when I got on the phone, the LSI agent told me I had to pay $25 for checking in 2.5 hours early!! Although flummoxed, I paid because my party was exhausted from the drive. . . Later in the room, my friend requested extra towels (because, girls being girls, we need lots of towels), which had to be done through LSI, and we were denied. My friend was asked by the LSI agent how many were staying in the room, and the agent told my friend we had sufficient amount of towels! From that point on, we all decided not to deal with LSI by not requesting any more services.   . . On the morning of our last day, I had to call LSI to request late check-out, knowing that I probably would have to pay for it again, and I was right! The person on the phone quoted me $35 to check out by 3 pm. I was glad that she offered check out at 12 pm without charge, because I had had enough of their rude service. Then around 11 am, a housekeeping staff, an LSI one, tried to enter our room to clean it. The housekeeping staff clearly had no idea we were checking out later, and he seemed liked he was inconvenienced that we were still in the room. . . All in all, the room, the Signature staff, and the MGM amenities were great, but partnering with another site management such as LSI definitely lowers MGM's credibility and brand. I'm sure all the other 1-star reviewers booked their rooms through LSI unbeknownst to them.
I know that for most guys heading to Vegas with their friends, Hotel Rooms don't really matter.  I mean we've all seen the Hangover, where one of the characters, I believe Stu, says that you don't even really stay at your hotel rooms.  . . However, albeit true, staying at a nice hotel definitely lifts your spirits up even more and makes Vegas a even more enjoyable experience.  And with that being said, the Signature is truly one of the nicest yet affordable hotels that you can stay at.. . So, I mean there are some cons to staying here.  First, being that it's not located right on the Strip, and Second, there's no casino inside the Signature.  Yet, if you're the type who doesn't like sniffing the smell of nicotine, while returning to your hotel room or you just want to avoid the large crowd of LV, there's no better place than the Signature.  Plus, the MGM is not too far away, and you can't get there pretty easily through access ways.  . . Finally, what I enjoyed the most about the Signature was that the room, at least the one I stayed at, had a balcony.  Also, if you book a larger room, the room also comes with a kitchen, so that's an added bonus.
This is generally the go to spot for me in Vegas and have stayed here countless times, but this time it felt a little off. We checked in this past August 2014 for my wedding and had 19 nights booked with 6 - 1 bedroom hotel rooms. The rooms were starting to appear very lived in and there haven't been any changes to the hotel in over 7 years, basically the hotel is starting to show its age. While staying there two separate rooms had issues with the televisions, one was fixed promptly and the second took over 24 hours to fix which was unacceptable. The final complaint that I have is, again this was for my wedding, is that we called for fresh towels; they took quite some time after ordering them so me and my newly wife did as most newly wed couples would do on their honey moon, without getting too descriptive, but prior to this we had put the do not disturb sign on the door- needless to say the hotel employee walked in on me and my new wife consummating our marriage.
Love love love this hotel,  will stay here every time!  For $109 a night it's well worth it!  Came with a kitchenette,  stove top,  micro,  fridge,  DVD player,  kid friendly with the pull out couch,  pool was super close,  good restaurants and food court! The only reason for 4 stars is there is quite a walk to the main casino and strip, worth it though to be away from all the craziness and it's non smoking!  I'm not into the gambling side of Vegas so being tucked back was awesome to me! Room was clean and well stocked! All the staff we came in contact with are amazing helpful and treated us like high rolling celebrities!
Easy check in and check out, valet was really quick and almost always parked my car out front because I was in and out so frequently.. . The room itself was nice, outdated by 5-7 years lol but very well kept. We had the 2 bedroom penthouse and it felt like living in an apartment. Pretty good views too considering we were off the strip. Oh and there's a Starbucks downstairs too. 5-10 min walk to MGM grand or the food court. . . Overall a very nice place to stay, especially when you consider how little they charge compared to others directly on the strip.
I just spent the last weekend here for my wedding. The majority of my wedding party stayed here as well. We had 5 suites total. I was initially impressed when walking through the lobby but upon reaching my suite was thoroughly disappointed. The floors were dirty and there was hair and crumbs on the floor from the previous guest. I had to have housekeeping come in and clean our rooms right at check in. I thought it was just my room but found out from my wedding guest that their rooms were also dirty. The television's didn't work in 3 of the 5 rooms and the 2 rooms that did have working televisions were fuzzy and hard to watch. I stayed here through MGM Signature and not Luxury Suites. Just when I thought my stay couldn't get worse, they messed up at checkoutand attempted to charge us for $450 more for our stay and the front desk lady argued with me when I was trying to explain that they made a mistake. After 30 minutes of having to pull all our receipts and payments for our room they discovered THEIR mistake and compt us for $80 of our stay but not after I was thoroughly pissed and embarrassed. My family, friends and I will not be staying here again.
Early check in and easy check out. Balcony suite with kitchenette and spa tub. Nice and quiet. Room always stocked. Not even 10 min walk to MGM or strip. We will Definitely stay there again!!!
Great stay, great location. I like that the rooms are a large size equipped with a kitchen: microwave, stove top, fridge, kitchen cupboards, toaster etc. . . Service was top notch, amazing. Only complaint was that we had to ask twice to get dishes brought up and they only stock the coffee and cream with the bare minimum. You have to get it replenished each day or ask for several days worth in advance. . . Loved the full walk in shower and large sunken jacuzzi tub! . Loved that the signature has three private pools, with access to the main pools. . . I would also say this place is probably great for kids. Two of the private pools are all ages and we saw a handful of kids enjoying it. This is more of a mellow hotel. . . The Starbucks inside and the one restaurant inside was great for easy breakfast. . . There is easy access to the monorail, which we took full advantage of!. . Enjoy!
Best hotel we have ever stayed at!! Will recommend to everyone and anyone!!! You are right on the strip with out being within the chaotic drunks and craziness!  THE BEST FRONT OFFICE STAFF EVER!!! Cant wait to return and enjoy another pleasant stay.
Ridic great room- We were surprised when we got this place for only $90 /night bc it had a full kitchen and was a great location. Room itself was awesome, easily 5 stars but collectively this experience was 3. The room wasn't clean when we got there, beds were made but the bathroom still had previous person's things in the shower, personal notes, receipts, change etc on the counters, urine on one of the toilet seats.. Just clear that the room wasn't clean. 2 bathrooms, huge jacuzzi tub, awesome view, awesome bed.. Just sucked bc it wasn't clean. The shower wouldn't drain and so I called maintenance- they never came to fix it.. . When we went down to get our car, i saw a valet guy jump into a car and gas it around a corner into the parking garage like it was nascar WITH THE DOOR OPEN & HIS FOOT HANGING OUT .. My bf and I just looked at each other like .. Did he really just do that? And in front of hotel guests ? Wow. So when he came back up to the hotel I said 'so do you drive all the guests' cars like that?' And he literally laughed and said 'no. Why? You afraid I'm going to drive yours like that?' I said 'uh yeah. Of course I am' he laughed again and said that was his friends car .. Or something. I was so mad. I talked to the manger. He was shocked at all of it, offered us vouchers for lunch and VIP to a club. Said he would check into the valet guy and would have the toon cleaned. Never heard anything else about the valet guy and room was never cleaned. There was more wrong but I've written enough
My friends and I stayed in a junior suite here for three nights. It's a gorgeous hotel; the rooms seem to be nicer than at the main MGM Grand.. . The bed was big and comfy. It has a huge bathroom with a tub, large shower and separate room for the toilet. I guess this is more geared towards couples than a few guys on a trip together... There's a little TV in the bathroom too, so your boob tube addiction doesn't go unfed.. . Each tower has its own pool and they all seem to be interconnected with outdoor paths. There were plenty of lounge chairs available, a bar (I assume there's one at each pool as well) and plenty of towels. Definitely a more laid back environment than the main pool or Wet Republic, which isn't a bad thing when you just want to chill out in the sun and not be completely surrounded by a bunch of meat heads and bros. . . Another reason to stay here instead of the MGM would be the line ups - I never saw the line up at the MGM shorter than 50 people, probably more. The only time I saw any people at all queued to check in/out at the Signature was on a Friday evening before a big music festival at the MGM, and even then it was just a handful.. . Some minor negatives that didn't factor in much are that it is a bit of a walk to get to the main part of the MGM, about a 10m brisk walk from Tower 2 to the main MGM lobby, a bit less to the hub of restaurants and bars in The District. Also, the fire pits are only available during the hours when the pool is open, until 8pm and must be turned on by the hotel maintenance crew, who are generally busy doing other things. 1. There's absolutely no point in having the fire pit on when its +30C in the *daylight* and 2. you're never going to wrangle someone down to getin on anyway.. . All in all though, the Signature was a fantastic choice and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, if/when I return to Vegas.
Let me start by saying that I'm very disappointed with the short stay here at The Signature.. I really had high hopes for this place but once again I went against the grain and ignored some of the slightly bad reviews of this place prior to booking it with high hopes that Id have a better experience than what I did! I booked this hotel last minute through the Hyatt Platinum Members line requesting a suite with a balcony on a high floor. Now that Hyatt has partnered with all of the MGM properties people who belong faithfully to the Hyatt program can now earn points when you stay at certain properties in vegas! Of course I understand that the hotels in general will accommodate you with your request based on availability.. Fair.. I pull up and it can be a bit confusing at first because the hotel is located on a small side street (E Harmon) when you get to the guard you have to let him know you have reservations and need to check in, they then will give you a paper with your last name on it and assign you a TOWER.. Being there is 3 I was assigned the Tower #1. Security was pleasant and so was valet however here is where tables turn.. I walk in and there are two windows open I am greeted with a very DRY "can I help you sir" from front desk agent Francisco.. He had to be one of the WORST front desk agents I've ever encountered in vegas.. No smiles.. Very monotone voice.. And when I asked him questions he seemed bothered. That turned me completely off. I thought who the hell hired him because he should never be the face of The Signatures front desk..  Constantly saying "Sir" in the wrong time can become a bit condescending and for that I should give 2 stars but I can't because to be fair the room was gorgeous! I know they teach proper guest standards and using the guest last name not SIR every other word.. I had an okay floor with a nice strip view! My last complaint is that you cannot call downstairs ahead of time to request your car.. Seriously?! The guy who checked me out explained because they are a small property they can't do call aheads for valet.. I guess.. Unsure if I'd ever stay here again! I had one good representative my entire stay that's terrible! It should've been from start to finish.. Period! You guys have to do way better!
Back again! This time we got a 1-bedroom suite on the 35th floor of Tower 2 (Room 720) - hence the 1 star upgrade as well.  We usual get a strip facing room, but went for the poolside and actually loved it. Wet Republic kept me entertained day and night, but that is another review!. . I took a zillion pics of the room. Fixed the bad bathroom lighting by moving the bedside lamps to the vanity in MY ginormous bathroom equipped with two vanities, tub for 5+, shower and private water closet. My b/f said the small bathroom off the living was nice and functional. . . It's two rooms with a full kitchen. What I LOVED was all the closet space. I turned the closets in the living room into a shoe closet (see pics) and used the one in the bedroom for my clothes. I took the silverware sorter from the kitchen and used it as a makeup caddy in the bathroom; worked like a charm! The most usable bathroom storage ever in a bathroom in Vegas. . . It does get crazy hot in the mornings on this side of the building, so if you want to sit outside in the am, be aware. Loved the view of the Grand Pool Complex (more pics on that review). . . Tower 2 is fantastic because you can still go out the back - we walked to the Cosmopolitan for dinner at STK. About a 7 minute walk. Love my rollup-shoes!  The bed was super comfy, the room had plenty of blackout shades and the roll-up tv in the desk was cool, but never used - we're not in Vegas to watch TV!. . We pretty much spend all day, and I mean all day, at the pool; then, go to clubs at night. Love that there is a Starbucks in Tower 1 and that little cafe Delights in Tower 2. . . Couple of things that sucked about the room, but not enough to dock stars this visit because other that the following the room was awesome:. 1) The slider was so hard to open that my b/f had to do it for me each time and he said his veins bulged in his arm when he opened it - Seen his pics? Should have not been an issue ;).  2) the TV won't turn off in the bathroom unless you push the GFC button on the electrical switch, as this is where my lamp was plugged in, I had to push reset to turn the lamp on. 3) WHY THE HECK ARE THERE NO ROBE HOOKS IN THE BATHROOM!!!!!? 4) bathroom lighting sucks.. .

This hotel, although not directly on the strip, was fabulous. It sits behind the MGM, so it makes for a little bit of a walk to get to the strip, but well worth it. We were on the 37th (penthouse) floor and had a spectacular view of the strip.. . The lobby was very welcoming. The staff at the front desk were both friendly and helpful. The cleaning crews were meticulous, efficient and very friendly.. . Our room was very large, beautifully furnished, very comfortable, and exceptionally clean! We had a king bed, HUGE bathroom with large jetted tub, sitting area furnished with a couch, chairs, and table that leads out to a very large veranda, a kitchenette that includes a refrigerator (medium sized, not one of those little tiny ones), sink, stove top, microwave, coffee maker and a blender. The bed was very comfortable. All linens very crisp and clean.. . The pool area was great. Lots of covered tables. Full food and drink service. The only bummer about the pool area is that is closes so early. We would have liked to sit in the hot tub in the evening, but it closes at 8:00. (This was the only thing during our 5 day stay that we found we were disappointed in.). . Travel tip.... look on VRBO for the best prices! You can get a screaming deal on a penthouse suite.
If you're looking for sun and relaxing WITHOUT KIDS instead of partying this is your pool! . . The Signature has 3 towers, and also 3 pools located different from the sun. So sun and shade is always possible but you have to be willing to move from pool to pool, hoping for a spot. In the months we're here (mostly late May and late September) pool 1 has the most sun hours, pool 2 the most shade. pool 2 and 3 are adjacent. Occupancy is about 80 persons a pool. In the weekends we've experienced several times that pool 1 was full.. . Because 90% of our stays is in tower 1 I will mostly share my experiences of this pool.. . Pool 1 has different furniture than pools 2 and 3. I believe it was last year that they replaced the old furniture that is still in use in 2 and 3. There is sun and light music all day. In the weekends drowned in the screaming and beats from the Wet Republic. Visitors are all hotel guests, so over 21 =). And mostly between 30-60. So a little older crowd.. . Depending on the time of year they open between 8-9am and close between 5-7pm. Smoking is not allowed (anymore), but outside the gate you still can and you'll find nice chairs and benches. Starting at 11-12am the have a full food and drink service. Not very cheap, but quality of the food is excellent.. . The only thing I really do not like is the quantity of umbrellas. Way, way to few. And hello, this is the dessert! If you ask me there should be a law forcing hotels to provide enough (free) shade and umbrellas. A few years ago they even made you pay $35 for an umbrella. Like I'm not paying enough already for my room and the extra fee to use the pool, gym and newspapers. Ridiculous! Luckily they stopped this. But 8-10 free umbrellas for the whole pool is not much. We just make sure we're on time to sit under an umbrella. Because of the jetlag, most of the times we wake up very early, so no problem.. . And excuse any grammar and spelling mistakes. English is not my first language. And if that isn't bad enough, my Apple device keeps changing words into 'proper Dutch'. Yes, you've guessed right, my first language.
Great place to stay at. BOOK YOUR ROOM EARLY. Trust me. 2 bedroom suite is a must if you're going with a group of people.
