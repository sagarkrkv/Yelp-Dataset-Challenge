I am from orange county. Home place of vietnamese food outside of vietnam. I do not see the appeal why this place is so packed.. . Most people from Orange County travel to Vegas for the weekend and wants to eat subpar vietnamese food at higher priced than back in Orange County. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS.. . People go here for Pho, as lines are long. People actually wait for Pho here.  I guess it is cheap food when compare to Vegas food on the strip.
The service was really rude. We came here twice and both times got an old grumpy waiter who's had an obvious attitude problem. . . For the food, they was salty and nothing special. I got rice serviced with steak the first time. The steaks tasted so old- they were all chewy and not even hot. They were barely warm meaning that they were overcooked and  kept there for a really long time.. I had their special combination pho the second time and the broth was real salty for my taste. The meatballs tasted so nasty.
The food is okay but the customer service is really bad.. . 1. I found hair on my pad thai, twice.. 2. The place is dirty, i dont know why people come here often.. 3. Only one person speaks english.. . I gave this place so many chances, but they seem to let me down. everytime I eat here, so never again.
This is one of my most favorite places here in Las Vegas. At any given time, this place is always packed - we even had a 20-min wait one time at close to 11pm!  But we endure the wait, which turned out to be not as long as we anticipated. . My favorite is their Rare Steak and Brisket soup. The broth is full of flavor. I've tried a lot of different places around Las Vegas but no one has broth like they serve here. . I also like ordering their spring rolls. It comes with sides of bean sprouts, mint leaves and lime and you wrap it with lettuce leaves. Yummy! . On our latest visit, we ordered the Japanese noodles. We keep forgetting to order it every-time we come here and finally this time we remembered it before we were already full. It was really scrumptious. No wonder why almost every table we saw had ordered this as well. . The fish stew was also delightful. The fish was tender and not overcooked. It was sauteed with ginger, which gave it a clean flavor. It was so good, I was conflicted whether I wanted to make more room for that or the rare steak pho that I usually order. I ended up eating the former and took the rest of the latter home. . As for my 4 star rating, as good as their food is, I take away a star bec of their service. The staff isn't very friendly and most of the time, their service is lousy. Lousy service won't keep me from coming back to this place though - I would just ignore it and look at my bowl of soup and it completely makes up for it.
It was 9am on a Saturday morning, and we're awake and hungover.  Pho Kim Long to the rescue!  We were staying at the Venetian, and had no idea where to go.  I searched Yelp, and voila! Pho Kim Long was only half a mile away.  . . I ordered my usual pho dac biet.  The prices were slightly higher than what I was used to in San Francisco, but it was well worth it. I'm not sure if it was because I was hungover or because I hadn't had pho in a long time, but I thought the broth was fantastic!  Everything else in the bowl was standard.  But my one gripe is that there was not tripe!  . . I've found my new go-to hangover spot in Vegas, and they're open 24 hours!
This place has changed a lot over the last few years. Probably because of the popularity. Open 24 hours and has quite a mix of patrons coming through which is cool but the staff is becoming lackadaisical and I notice ego and that's not a good sign. I hope they fix a few staff problems because this used to be one of my favorite places to eat pho. Now? Not so much. Almost too popular which is why they seem to be losing their professionalism. Maybe just a bad night but very different from when I remember in the past. Was 2am and the server couldn't careless about everyone else except the table full of girls sitting across. Forgot several items and was still charged for them. No point in complaining because my meal was already ruined.
I have to say that I absolutely love this place. I have been going here since I was 10 and I'm 23 now and I will continue to keep coming as long as I can
My go to Pho place when in Vegas, but there can be a long wait sometimes. Food is good, service not so much.
Very tasty pho! It was 4 of us and we had to wait about 10-15 minutes to be seated which was not bad considering there was a lot of people waiting and it was lunch time! I liked they have a wide variety of drinks! We got the fresh coconut juice and lemon soda, the pho bowls are very well served and they also serve beer and wine. Service was very good and fast! I got a bowl with brisket and chicken and my husband got the combination bowl and they were both really good! It was the perfect recovery meal for our Vegas trip!
I give one star not for the food but for the service! We had a very bad experience today during lunch time. Our server was a male old asian guy. I forgot to get his name because we just want to get out of this place asap! He was so rude and sarcastic! Hope the management will talk to him so he will straighten up!
(4.5 stars). . After a long night out, my cousins and I woke up Saturday morning wanting something to fix that typical Vegas hangover. What else but pho, right?. . This spot is located in Vegas's version of Chinatown, located right off the Strip. If you're taking a taxi, make sure you ask your driver for their taxi company's phone number so you have someone to pick you up. It's a frequent spot for taxi drivers, so it shouldn't take too much to describe where you're at.. . Ordered the #13, which is basically pho with every type of meat. I don't know, it's not the world's best pho, but if you have the drunchies or need a cure for your hangover, this may as well be the best pho you'll have within the next hour.. . Personally, my drunk Yelper self would say that they give a good ratio of noodles to broth. However, my sober and more critical Yelper self would wish there was more meat. But my drunk/hungover Yelper self wins this review.. . They're open 24 hours by the way. Pho after the club? You betcha.
Look, I come from the Bay Area... more specifically San Jose, which has a large population of Vietnamese and of course Pho restaurants, so I think I've tasted what's close to the real deal. However, of course the morning after some heavy drinking out in Vegas, the first thing that comes to a Bay Area native's mind is "My God... some pho would be the perfect cure right now." Hence, my cousins and I went on a hunt to find some pho. Funny thing is there is also a "Pho Kim Long" where we are from, so we thought we'd give this place a chance. Hopped into a cab and asked the cab driver himself if he had a favorite Pho place. And right off the bat he named this place! . . The restaurant itself is bigger than most pho restaurants I've been to, and definitely the NICEST looking. I'm used to cheap restaurants that look a bit dirty inside. This place actually has ambiance. Service wasn't too shabby as well, and honestly don't know if it was because I was super hungry (and slightly hungover) but I could say this was the best pho I've ever eaten... surprised it was in Vegas! Even my sister's vermicelli salad looked bomb and perfectly proportioned. Be warned as they only have one size and no "larges" for you hungry hippos. Or maybe they do, but it's not listed on the menu.. . Definitely should open a location on the strip and they'd make so much money. I wiill definitely consider coming back to this place for my hangover cures if I am to return to Sin City.. . Side tip: Taxi ride from Cosmopolitan hotel to Chinatown where this place is located is about ~$13.00 (one trip)
One star off for heavy use of msg which is outside of a better word is chemical poison and bad for you.
Their pho was very good compared to any other pho stores here in Vegas. However they're not getting 5 stars Bcs the food was not as hot as I would like it. The broth wasn't hot enough to cook the bean sprouts. . . But overall it tastes good with pretty decent service.
I had the chicken pho, it was okay. The service here was terrible though and it just felt like they were rushing us. I tried the pho again by takeout and I still wasn't impressed.
Open 24 hours. Our server was great. Food was yumm. I notice they offer varieties of family style meals. Thinking of trying it out the next time were in town.
What's better than pho after staying out until 4 am partying your brains out? Not only that but you're partying in VEGAS! Pho Kim Long is literally the biggest pho restaurant I've ever seen. The line can build up, so be prepared for that.. . Pho Tai ($7.75). Awesome broth!! Noodles and rare steak are great, but I HIGHLY recommend adding meatballs to any pho you get. Probably the best meatball in pho I've had.. . Egg Rolls ($6.50). How can you order pho without egg rolls. I recommend the egg rolls as well. Nice little appetizer before your hangover meal.. . Next time after partying at Marquee or Hakkasan, I'm coming here the morning after.
Not the same as it used to be.... Smaller portions .... Like Drake says, nothing was the same ....
We came here at around 3 AM.... . 2 stars for being open late... but everything else was a disappointment.  We got the Mongolian Beef (beef was chewy and often times not even able to be swallowed).  Won Ton Egg Noodle Soup (broth was okay, but the wontons seemed undercooked and had an odd flavor, and the noodles were kind of hard and undercooked...) the chicken fried rice was slightly better... but the egg was an alarming shade of orange and the rice tasted bland and pretty flavorless.. with very small pieces of chicken. . . We were hoping for better, but unfortunately we left disappointed with out eating much of the food we had ordered.
Ordered within 2 mins of arriving, food arrived within 5 mins, and boy was it TASTY! Best Pho in Vegas for sure!! Was in and out in 25 mins, so it was super efficient too!. . We come here every time we come to Vegas
This is our go to place for Vietnamese food when in Vegas. It's pretty good.
This place absolutely Sucked!!! Deserved NO STARS if that was an option, overhyped and overflowing with Douchebags...Never Again....Phok Yu - PhoKimLong
The only reason I come to this place is because of their great food. I hate everything about it. Especially the customer service! If they would at least say hi or smile, I would tip them better.
The staff is always friendly, the food is always fresh and you hardly ever have to wait for a table.  If you like pho, this is definitely the best restaurant in Vegas for it.  Great prices on quality foods.
Excellent. I eat at a lot of Asian restaurants and this one is on point. Friendly staff that obviously likes their jobs, fast service and solid food. It's great to see a restaurant that I can recommend. If you love Pho, go. And it's open 24 hours! Respect.
Honestly, this Vietnamese pho restaurant is not as good as it claims to be. It claims that it's "The best" in Las Vegas when it should be the opposite. It is definitely more expensive compared to other pho restaurants and the food isn't worth it. I tried the bun bo hue and as a Vietnamese person myself, I know exactly what it should taste like and this dish did not satisfy my expectations. It was not spicy at all and the soup base just didn't taste right.
Its 24/7 so thats convenient but nothing special about the food unless you're really drunk and starving. Service is horrible. My order was wrong twice and half way thru my meal i went to the bathroom only to return to my table cleared and cleaned. My waiter asked "oh you still hungry?" And i still paid and just walked out. Go to another pho spot. I highly doubt other pho restaurants would be worse than this one.
Fast service, good food. Although they serve other Asian cuisine that isn't much to write home about.
Vegas, you Pho Me Long. All night long. And nothing cures those hangovers and burns away the sins of your soul better than a large bowl of Pho Tai + meatballs + eggs rolls + a thai tea. . . Much better than their SJ counterpart. It can get busy but service doesn't skip a beat. These folks hustle!
Amazing. I had the veggie pho (for dieting reasons). This was amazing. I recommend this place completely.
This place was just ok for me. I liked the fact that this place is open 24 hours since the other restaurant was just about closing by the time I would've gotten there. That's really the only good thing that stood out to me when I went here. Service wasn't amazingly quick but it wasn't bad. The food though was nothing really amazing and was kinda pricey for pho. I got that as well as other and one pad thai. The pad thai was very good and flavorful but as mentioned pricy for the amount that was given. The thai tea was probably biggest disappointment for me since it nearly half ice as I drank the whole thing so quickly and saw there so much ice, so I'd recommend asking for little or no ice if you get thai tea. Pho was $9 for large bowl which seemed more like a regular bowl at other places and pad thai was $12. Definitely come here for the late hours, but I suggest elsewhere for better Vietnamese food.
Fine stir-fry dishes can be found in this IT spot. I vaguely remember the pho, but people love them and they are served generously. .  . Item #122: Chicken with seasonal greens is delicious plate of sliced tender chicken, brocolli, Chinese brocolli, baby bok choy, carrots, bean sprouts, and ginger in a salacious opaque sauce is almost perfect. Probably loaded with MSG...but delicious. The calamari is a guilty pleasure for me. It's greasy, heavy breaded and sprinkled with a fried I'm-not-sure-what-to-call-it, but it resembles hair dandruff on steroids. I will eat it anytime.. . Parking is baffling and amusing. The lot is tight and small. I witnessed people yell at each other due to near collisions. Service is no-nonsense and apathetic. At the end of the day, they're not here to make friends and will probably throw you under the bus.
I like to look at myself as a pho expert. I eat it at least once a week. This place was a huge disappointment. Not only are they racist! They think I don't know how to use chop sticks because I'm white!!! But the broth was so salty it tasted like they poured salt all over my food. I will not be going back here.
This pho house seems to have been around Vegas's Chinatown forever and a year.  It stays open pretty late which is great for those with the munchies in the middle of the night but too cheap or broke to pay more for casino food.  The pho & rice dishes are pretty good.  The menu is pretty extensive, it has Chinese & Korean dishes too.
I'm pissed. After not eating all day and coming from Drai's day club, the only thing on our minds all day was a nice warm bowl of pho. They wouldn't let us dine in because we weren't fully dressed. Not only that, they were so rude in the manner they were speaking to us. I'm extremely disappointed because I've heard nothing but good reviews about this place from my friends. There are plenty of pho restaurants in the area. I will not be returning.
Really good vegan pho! Didn't love the sardine style seating (pet peeve of mine) but the food was excellent.
This place is pretty! It's date night worthy.  I went here with a friend and there is always a line.  You have to sign in when you get there and we chilled outside since it was after sunset, but the line went quick and service was quick.  It's not eerily quiet, and not too noisy where you can't carry a conversation.  We got the beef pho and meatball pho.  Both were great, steaming hot, very tasty.  I really enjoy the environment and the food.
