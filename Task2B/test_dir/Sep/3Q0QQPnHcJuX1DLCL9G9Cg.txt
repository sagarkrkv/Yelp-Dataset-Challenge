One of the nicest airports in the United States! Plenty of shopping, as well as food options within the airport's gates. One of the few airports that resembles a shopping mall more than an actual airport!
This message is in reference to Alex P's  derogatory comment regarding the airport facilities especially the bathrooms where you had to 'wade in piss'....Liar liar pants on fire.. Having used the airport for over 4 decades I have always found the place to be immaculately kept from one end to the other.. Future travelers the airport is a credit to  Charlotte.
I has to stop at this airport for my lay over on us airways going to Philly. No hassle, no drama. If u have to lay over. Let it be here. I really like the way this airport islaid out. The food court is awesome and they had some one playing the piano. It wAs very soothing to me especially with the stress of getting from one side of the airport to the other. I really wish they had a tram for this but the food court made up for it.
You cannot sleep inside the terminal overnight, which is horrible if you miss the flight or if its oversold- beyond your control.  This situation happened to me a few years ago and it was not enjoyable, hopefully it has changed.. . I recently moved to the area and am impressed that daily parking is $5 per day.  They are doing construction to expand the lots, hope the price will stay the same.. . Recently flew United for a very early morning flight, the gate agent was awesome!  She was welcoming, comical, pleasant and professional.  She made my morning!  Previously, I have flown US Airways into and out of CLT.. both positive, negative and neutral experiences.  . . Didn't really have time to check everything out, but they have some nice areas in the airport for lounging and relaxing, and also some nice eateries.  Bathrooms were clean.  Airport information was helpful in locating the bus stop for long term parking.  The buses ran frequently and were large enough to accommodate a few families with luggage storage.
This is a huge airport with flights just about everywhere. However,  unlike some other large US airports it does not seem overcrowded. Check in is average. There are tons of delicious food options here. One of the best airports for food and shopping I've been too. Be prepared to walk a lot but at least you don't have to leave the building.
The airport, and the surround area, is currently undergoing some renovations. This is leading to some confusing roads, a bit of an unsightly mess inside the airport, and a bit of a delay in getting to/from the airport. Allow some extra time when flying in and out. Overall, it seemed like any other hub, with decent food options, sporadic outlets through out, some moving walkways to speed movement through the airport, and the usual TSA.
This airport was amazing because I got through security in 5 minutes, but it felt like it was 90 degrees inside and I was sweating like crazy.
I hate the baggage claim area, bt love the free wifi. So its even. Oh wait. parking is bad. too much traffic!
This is by far one of the warmest and most crowded airports I've been to.. . I'm not sure how big this airport is, but after taking a stroll throughout the whole facility, I saw that every terminal was bustling with people. Seats were filled up and many people were standing up while waiting for their flight.. . Restrooms are fairly clean -- I like how there are attendants there ensuring that the sinks were dry and that there are paper towels in every dispenser. Hey, they even have a basket of candy there, too. I'm surprised some US airports have that -- I usually see attendants in overseas airports.. . Most of the airport staff members are friendly. Shop owners were also friendly to talk to while shopping for a few things. The selection of restaurants, however, isn't too great. Then again, if your layover isn't too long, that shouldn't be too big of an issue.. . There's free WiFi but it takes forever for me to connect, whether on my iPhone or my Mac. Also, this airport needs more charging stations; there aren't enough to go around for the thousands of people who go through the terminals.. . And YES, as Skye A. mentions, PLEASE turn the damn AC on in EVERY terminal! It sucks when you get in an argument with the Sbarro cashier -- it sucks even more knowing that the heat is adding to your frustration!
I know next to nothing about Charlotte, North Carolina. It's only because I needed a connecting flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida that I even came here. For that reason, my expectations of this airport were quite low and I thought I would be here for a forgettable hour or so of my life.. . That wasn't the case. This airport is actually kind of nice! It's small and clean and cute. I didn't know that there would be such an international airport in a place like this. You really can't get lost in somewhere as simple as this. Everything is easy to find, and I'm still surprised that this airport deals with out-of-country flights.. . There is a central food court that is fairly big and even features someone playing live music on a grand piano. The pathways to and from this area are equipped with moving walkways for your convenience. The place is air-conditioned well enough because it can get really hot in North Carolina even in September. And plus, free Wi-Fi! It may not be the most significant airport in the world, but it's a pleasure to travel through.
Very nice airport! Lots of places to spend money!!! No electrical outlets- (few), a guy wants me to tip him in the bathroom?? He ain't wiping my ass!!! And typical 3 hr layover to get fricking anywhere! I hate this place...:)
This is my favorite airport and was a big reason I moved to Charlotte. Getting in an out is a breeze. The airport is big enough to hold the number of flights it does but does not overwhelm. Let's start with getting in. If you are cabbing then it's super easy. Most fliers take US airways so get down right in the middle, highly recommend the mobile boarding pass to skip lines, a number of kiosks help as well.. Premier status gets you easy access through checkpoint C, usually there are no lines, except if the security officer is not around, then everyone makes a beeline for C. Once through security, there are a couple of decent food options. Recommend the beaudevin, will review that separately. Starbucks is always crowded. Smattering of the usual airport shops. If you are in the mood for (window) shopping, there is a row of shops: Johnston and Murphy, Lacoste, PGA etc. The whole airport is pretty much walkable. Just leave enough time if you have to get to the high E gates: E36 can be a bit far.
What a wonderful airport to have a layover in! There is such a wide variety of places to eat, from a tequileria to fast food and nice sit  down restaurants.  In addition to that, the shopping is amazing for an airport. There are several nice clothing, jewelry, and accessory stores.  Everything is pretty accessible from one terminal to another.. . Additionally if you don't want to shop or eat, there is a lovely section between the B Terminal and the C Terminal where they have a long line of wooden rocking chairs and beautiful trees. It's great for people watching and to just relax between flights. . . This is definitely an airport I want to come back to on future trips.
I changed my mind.... Not a bad airport at all. My beef is the airline. Free wifi, good sushi and seafood in the food court- crowded but again- airlines. As for the bath rooms - worth a tip not  to stand in piss on the floor and having clean bathrooms is rare. . . Can you forgive me! When I go to Boston I have to go through here so learning to adjust.
Love This airport. Had been convenient and an easy place to pick up. Recent changes have me worried however......I believe the city has taken over. Previously,there were no traffic people located at the pick up area. There was rarely traffic,or an issue. Now with  the addition of "the annoyance traffic patrol", it is no longer fun to pick up.Traffic has picked up because of these agents. Why try to fix something that wasnt broken. Valet parking prices were tripled  New constuction abounds. Lets hope they dont mess up this great asset.
Even with a relatively short layover, I was able to make my connection without using moving sidewalks or transporters. It was exhausting, but it was possible. . Big, crowded and bustling. But pretty well-run.
Parking sucks!!
I have traveled almost over 20 times from this airport. You see the nicest staff and you see the nastiest staff. . I had a first class ticket with my wife to puertovallarta and they told me you are 5 minutes late and you can't travel and you need to comeback tomorrow.. And they gave me the economy tickets.. I was treated disrespectfully in custom when I arrive to US.. . I always thinking that what is next.
Concourse C..starting with the nasty B at Wolfgang Puck...you VOLUNTEERED for the job. Maybe ringing up pre packaged food is not for you. This is not the first time I have had the displeasure of you nasty attitude. I am sorry your life is so miserable,  but please refrain from taking it out on the people willing to give your company money. . Derrick at the news stand right before gate C19...you see the huge line, there are 4 employees standing around talking to you. I ask if you know howto run a register you say no..tell one of the other girls to start ringing and you leave. Your foul mouthed employee then proceeds to complain about what a dick you are and tells me it's not her job to bag the $20 shirt I just purchased.  People of the Charlotte airport, there is a reason I avoid flying US Air. Your bad attitude and horrible service is part of the reason. I never receive such horrible service, over all at any other airport and I fly all the time.
All-in-all this is a very nice airport.  Some reviews say it is small, but I think that is only because they only saw their concourse.  As a Charlotte resident, this is my airport for domestic and international flights.  I think I've been to every terminal and can tell you that it is a quite large airport.  There are some pretty decent restaurants and shops if you need to kill some time between flights. . . My only critique would be the process for international arrivals. American citizens no longer have to fill out the customs declaration form, but do have to queue up for a bank of machines that take your picture and scan your passport.  The machine then spits out a ticket you give to the customs agent.  It is a bit of a melee, but doesn't take all that long.
