Just heads up. This place looks like it will be closed for a good portion of September.
I love this place, no joke.  For years and years I have come to Vegas, and have been missing out.  It's so weird, it's awesome, it was one of the highlights of my trip, no lie. . . Peppermill feels like to stepped in a time capsule into a diner with odd waitresses wearing ball gowns.  The food is cheap and very very good.  They are open 24 hours, and have a super cool little lounge that was filmed on Gigolos (If you haven't seen it google, no judgement here :))  We ordered sandwiches all round, with sweet potato fries.  Everything we had was a super large portion and very tasty.  . . The lounge part is my favorite with a big sunken in room with a large fire pit right in the middle.  Drinks are reasonable, and service was fast.  Def. a cool little spot to get your grub on at 3a.m. or romantic spot for drinks.  Loved it!
The Peppermill is a Vegas version of Denny's but with large portions and retro decor. It really does look like it a throwback version of what Vegas was in the 70's. The employees wear weird costumes that I don't quite understand. The waitresses dress in blue and white overall/romper get-ups and the bartenders wear ball gowns....it's just unexplainable. But the service itself was sort of slow. It seemed as if there were more employees on the clock than actual customers. . . The do have a guy who comes around and takes photos to capture your dining experience. It's sort of like Buca di Beppo and you get a complimentary photo with your meal. The photographer did inform us he wasn't with the restaurant and worked off commission so it was kind of awkward not buying the photo..... . But as far as the food, it's mostly breakfast options, the portions are large, and it's relatively inexpensive.  I had the Crab Cake Bene (poached eggs and grilled crab cakes on toasted English muffins, smothered in Hollandaise sauce) and I opted for the Hollandaise sauce on the side rightfully so because it was REALLY thick and salty. The crab cakes were already heavily salted down so it really didn't need to be lathered, smothered or bathed in any salt. . . This place has a decent location, decent price; ok food, LARGE portions, sort of outdated and gimmicky but possess a charm none-the-less. I wouldn't suggest the CrabCake Bene nor any of their other lunch items but they do serve Breakfast all day 24hrs so it seems like a great drunk place to visit. Other than that its mehhhh
Ahhh... The Peppermill and fireside lounge.  I think the Peppermill side is a bit like a Denny's restaurant but with better decor and slightly better food. I do however highly recommend checking out the fireside lounge. They have a pretty neat setup with a full bar and gaming and comfortable lounge style seating.  They also have a firepit with sofas surrounding it.  Very relaxing and nice to take a date or friends to share a "fishbowl" sized drink. 21 and over on the fireside section and only appetizers.  I always like to tell my friends "PM in the AM" as we seem to go to the Peppermill in the early mornings.
Cool atmosphere and many occasions I run into a celebrity here but I don't come for that. The food is large portions and decent but pricey and service sometimes lack. Upscale casual with a side bar to get more privacy.
I ordered the chorizo breakfast meal. Food is good but service sucks here. The waitress didn't ask if anyone needed refill of coffee or water and when we have to ask for it, it takes awhile for it to come. I'm giving it two stars because the food is good but the service is poor that I won't come back. I can't enjoy good food with bad/poor service. Price is reasonable and portions is huge. The waiting wasn't long. It took less than ten minutes to sit nine of us.
Neon lights.. Sparkly trees.. Slot machines in the waiting area.. Stained-glass lamps.. . The Peppermill is a well-known diner open 24 hours.  They serve giant plates of grub as well as all-day breakfast, but people really come to Peppermill for the disco-diner decor. What a unique-looking place and I am glad I finally got to try it!  I also liked how even though it was quite busy the server didn't try to hurry is to leave - lol.  Note that they are closed the week of Labor Day for remodeling.  I can't wait to see what it'll look like as it looks pretty rad as is.  (I asked the cashier, and she said she had no idea what they have planned and she'll have to walk into work and find out the new look like everyone else...lol).
Love coming here. Old school Vegas feel. Great vegetarian selection. Food comes In large portions and the food is always amazing. My favorite dish is the crab cake Ben. They have a restaurant side and a lounge side. The lounge has fire Pitt and comfortable low lit seating. The perfect spot to come eat after a night of clubbing. If your hungry or u just wanna hang out and drink.  If your ever in vegas u have to try it.
Very good food and huge portions-good for sharing. When we r in Vegas we always make a point to stop here. Come here when u are very hungry : )) Purple Rain colors inside decor...fun fun
I still love this place, and will continue to bring visiting guests here, but this particular visit was less than stellar.  . . We came at 1:00...my first time for lunch, and they were packed.  We had to be put on a waiting list, but it only took about 5 minutes to seat us. However, after being seated, it took them at least 10 minutes to even come ask for our drinks...well, non-alcoholic...the cocktail waitress was right there. Gotta love Vegas. . . Anyway, I ordered the Conquest (no onions of course) at the waitresses' suggestion and it was just mediocre. The roast beef was bland and the sandwich needed more sauce. The bread was good though. Fries were ok, but a little greasy.  The ice tea was good. . . Next time I will just go with my own choice. LOL!
Fire side Bar was very cool, sorta awkward to lounge around the fire with random people, but It's not like I payed to be a VIP, LOL....  . THE DRINKS:.      THE SCORPION: Let me just tell you, "ITS HUGE" it's literally a 2 gallon fish tank!! It's super yummy though she waitress said it had like 6 shots in it..      .       KEYLIME PIE MARTINI: Taste just like pie, normal size.. . FOOD:.        PASTRAMI BURGER: Well done and very tasty I paired it with onion rings. Huge servings, so I took most of it home since I ordered and finished my drink before any of the food.. .         Chicken Parmesan: Okay let me just tell you, the noodles are neon orange but OMG!!! It's the best neon orange noodles I have ever tried in my life!!! It's got  little spicy kick to it and basically magic in your mouth, again the portions are huge so my husband took most of it back to our room.. . Overall a great experience and will be back for sure my next time in Vegas, the prices are very standard but keep in mind the portions are huge!!! Oh and there's a guy who comes around to take your picture for free (tip the guy)
The lounge OK ..... Well one time years ago b4 YELP ... We had a couple regular drinks  martinis goood my girlfriend never got I'd check well she is from Europe taller than me ...but younger ... . I returned in a couple weeks with my cousin she just came to USA  her I'd was no good to them she was 24 at the time how ironic . Other time I try to use my discover cc . WE DO NOT!!!! TAKE DISCOVER CC  YOU HAVE TO PAY CASH!!!. I went to the door I took a picture of the cc sticker on the the door .... Then I ask for the mgr ....... Rude way to say the we are no longer accenting discover cc well the cover a 40$ bill. And the remove  the door cc sticker ... I been there over the years only to the bar . Sometimes the bartender have no so good of a day ... We all been there  over all is a good place ... It use to be more romantic but now the lights are so bright ... . I guess some one got caught on something more than a " R " rated more like a xxx actividades. Well I live that place .....
this is probably my favorite diner type restaurant in the entire world. It is so much fun, the food is fantastic, and it is open 24 hours.  it is also retro in a really good way.  The Cobb salad and breakfast food are my favorite.
A Vegas Classic. This place is like a mullet, business up front, party in the back.  The front restaurant is pretty much a "Denny's" but the back has late night bar food, sunken booths with a fire pit and old school decor with neon lights and probably the original lights from 1980.  So fun!. . The food is exactly what you would expect, bar food.  Good quality but bar food nonetheless.
This is an excellent place for meals in vegas. Breakfast all the time but the place is upbeat and alive with great food that comes out fast and is good to eat. The portions are enormous so come hungry. Bagels don't expect New York but the rest is top of the line. Love the sour dough myself. Ambience is adult but fun.
The place to go in Vegas when you're tired of "Vegas".  Two words: Fireside Lounge. All that and Reno, too!
Review is only based on service and take out. We came here on a Friday night/Saturday morning at 5:00 AM! the place was full!! We came here because our limo driver convinced us it was popular and good. . . This place is a diner. The inside is very colorful as in purple, green, turquoise, yellow. From what I rememberjungle themed.  Inside its a bit sketchy. Nothing like the other restaurants on the strip. Crowd was a bit more "hood" or "ghetto". Please don't hate me for these comments. . . We ordered a grilled chicken burger and a basket of fruit to go. The 2 others we were with stayed to dine in. They got breakfast. Lets just say they finished eating before we got our take out order. Once our order finally came she forgot our fruit basket and the check. We almost ended up leaving at the same time as the 2 that actually stayed and dined in. . . Service was terrible!!!!!  . . I think I have to come back, dine in and try their breakfast.
Always one of my favorite places to go ANYTIME in Las Vegas
The pep!!  I like this place. Great for a drunken 5am food run.... . Traditional dishes like omelettes and pancakes.... . I warn you however, the dishes are huge.  You can definitely share the plates.  It's not the best food on earth but it's good large portioned meals reasonably priced.... . I mean it's cheaper than eating at the hotel, and because you can share the dishes... it becomes more valuable.. . The only draw back is it's far north from all the action and it looks like you stepped into an episode of "All in the family" and you're expectin vic tayback to make your omellete...
The Peppermill feels like a truly Las Vegas experience! Anyplace else in the world and this place would be quite out of place but in LV, it's freaking perfect! Neon all over the place and kitschy as hell! (In a good way) I know all the reviews talk about this but I can't stress this enough: the portions are huge!! If you're like me and like to have leftovers, by all means get a plate just for yourself and unless you're Joey Chestnut or Adam Richman, you can expect more than enough for another full meal at home. If you're a tourist though and won't be taking a doggie bag, please do yourself a favor and share a plate with your partner so there won't be so much food wasted. The only reason I gave 4/5 is because the waitress, although friendly, just wasn't super attentive. That being said, I'd definitely come back and would most likely bring a date because this restaurant/lounge is just too kitschy/glitzy/vegasy (is that a word?) not to love.
Awesome decor, good prices, OK food, spotty service.. . My girlfriend and I had dinner at the Fire Side Lounge.  Walking in, we saw a sign saying "No hats allowed," and they mean it (another couple had to leave when the woman refused to take off her ball cap).  We sat on the comfortable couch by the fire. (Very nice!) and had our drink and food order taken quickly.  The food was OK but on the greasy side.  When it came to getting another round, the waitress was nowhere to be seen.  We flagged another one who indicated she would be right with us (she never came back), but it was near 15 minutes until someone was able to take our order.. . Overall, a good place to relax, enjoy a drink, and to have a small bite.  The service issue won't dissuade me from coming back.
P-mill is that 24 hour diner that's no joke . It's like the ones you see on diners drive ins & dives. (If you don't know what that show is you should not be on yelp). But with a Vegas twist.. . Ok so first thing is this place is located on the north side . Of the strip so you will see the typical homeless men,working girls. And worst of all tourist but don't fret it's worth the danger.. . The inside is a Vegas style diner where every table I saw was a booth. The waitresses are dressed old school cheerleader style and they're very nice . It just feels clean and fresh for a diner I didn't expect that. . Now to the food ; the portions are out of control huge . But most of all it's fresh food not Denny's IHOP BS. I highly recommend the French toast ambrosia, hash browns. Lemon blueberry muffins, Chicken fried steak or any dessert. The food is great diner food triple d worthy. . This place is very underrated in my book with so many . Ridiculously Horrible Fake ass 4 star restaurant on yelp like . Bistro pizza who's 4.5 stars but Settlebellos is 4 what a joke  . If Bistro is 4.5 so is chuckie cheese . or Ventano Italian where they serve Chef Boyardee or. Hanks in Gvr which is lame station casino Buffett food. Designed  as fine dining. station casino "Where we Hate locals" . Ok let me stop and count to 10 before I call out all you wack ass . Wannabe restaurants on yelp.  . The mill that is pepper is a ideal place to take your fat uncle . Or any other fat relatives you have . Take your drunk buddies or a late night date . But don't take anyone with a small appetite. not the right spot for quitters
I had heard a lot about this place so I was excited to check it out. The fire side lounge was amazing inside! Perfectly cheesy decor witha vintage feel. The atmosphere would have been perfect except for TV screens everywhere!! The mirrors on the walls reflected the screens so you literally could not escape them! We tried to find one booth without a screen in front of our faces but no luck, so we ended up moving to the restaurant. I understand that some people like to go out and watch the game but people also like to go out to socialize face to face without the distraction of moving pictures everywhere. If they just turned off half the TVs and played some cool tropical vintage music (or any kind of music really) instead of blasting the TV announcer, they could create a really awesome atmosphere.
My family liked this place.  I did not.. I thought t was dirty and the service very poor.. My wife loved her omelette.  My kids their breakfasts.  I am not a breakfast guy, but evenso, the place was dirty and the service terrible.. I would not eat here again.
I am NEVER disappointed with the food and service here! Today it was the Lorraine Omelette...so good!
A crazy retro dinner with great ambiance. The portions are huge and very good. The 24 hour breakfast menu is highly recommended.
