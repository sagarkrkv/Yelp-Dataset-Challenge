The rooms were beautiful. Well appointed and very spacious. BUT, we had gurgling plumbing issues that was very annoying and would wake us up at all hours of the night. Maintenancecame up to resolve the issue, but said he'd have to run a snake and that it would probably make mess and stink up the room. This was not an option. We endured another night of noisy pipes.. We had a beautiful pool side view, 23rd floor, BUT Snoop Dogg DJ'ing at the Tao on Saturday night was very loud. even on the 23rd floor. I enjoy a good party as much the next person, BUT it made for a long night. We expressed our displeasure with management and they were courteous and waived the resort fee, big whoop, and gave us a $50.00 food credit. They didn't go out of their way to assist us in our dissatisfaction with the stay. We were very disappointed, as we were celebrating our anniversary. Will we return? That remains to be seen.
One of the best hotels I ever stayed at. My biggest complaint was getting lost lol Room service was spectacular. Room was GIANT. 2 TV's, 2 huge beds, 2 huge rooms, I could go on for days about how large, clean & great this hotel was. It's been a few years but I would love to go back whenever I have the time.
The resort is indifferent to guest's discomfort and does not even act on complains. Reasoning below:. (I am writing this review from with in the Venetian suites). 1. I was visiting with my wife and booked a luxury suite, upon check in I was offered to a newly remodeled suite (which turned out to be false once we were in the suite) with a great view for additional $45 on 29th floor. I agreed and checked in. The suite was pretty well decorated and comfortable. The trouble started since the following day morning. They started some constructionand drilling work all day long since 9am and it made the annoying drilling noise which was so loud my wife literally had to shout out to talk to me inside the room.. 2. I called the front desk complaining about the same and they said they can't stop the construction but can shift us to the 8th floor normal suite. I was surprised by the indifference the lady showed. When I insisted I had booked a luxury king suite and also have paid extra she offered to waive the $45 I had paid in case I decide to move. The noise seems to be getting louder and very annoying. Moving is painful as it literally means you do a complete packing! I never expected such an attitude and poor planing form a huge hotel resort like Venetian. They seem to be taking guest's for granted. If any construction was planned at all the suite should not have been allotted at the first place. very poor service and even worse customer complain redressal. I will not recommend anyone to stay here for sure.
Rooms (Suites 32 floor) are gorgeous..  Spa a bit over priced for just a manicure but hey it's Vegas baby.  The Grand Lux Cafe has some terrific food - yum on the Carmel Fried Chicken - Whoah!!!  The restaurant Aqua Knox doesn't have as good food as I recall the prior two times but Hillary (waiter) is the best.  When he retires in April - after 19 years - well... I can't say I'll go back.  Mesa Grill is spectacular but the best restaurant by far was Delmonico's.  OMG for the price - it was unbelievably good.  Seriously, my husband and I had fried chicken..  Yeah at a steak place - buttermilk fried chicken - the bomb!!  hahahaha  Our son got the bone in Filet Mignon and it was superb (even rare).  The one individual I'd like to have you see when you get to the hotel is Danny Pascarelli at the Circle Bar in the Casino.  Danny is old school service.  He won't forget your name, what you drink or make you feel any other way than an ol friend.  Danny remembers the what bartending should be - he's classy and sophisticated.  He knows how to treat people and takes care of all the guests (multi-tasking like crazy) while making each individual feel like they are the only ones at the bar.  He facilitates introductions and gets people having fun, playing the games and really having a good time.  Nice 4 night stay and quite comparable to the Palazzo.  The Gonzales Family truly had a wonderful time and we'll be back.  One last note... Carne Vino is also a fantastic restaurant if you can drop minimum $100 per person.  It was a great experience and the food was amazing.  This was our 2nd time at Carne Vino and back to back 2 thumbs up.
To be honest, my parents (who are both platinum level Grazie) have been taking me to the Venetian ever since the resort first opened. One could say I basically grew up on the sidelines of the casino, biding my time in the arcade and waiting for the day when I could participate in real gambling and win some money instead of stupid arcade prizes. About 4 years ago, that day finally arrived and I haven't looked back since. The standard rooms at Venetian/Palazzo cannot be compared to any other resort casino on the strip. The standard rooms are literally suites and extremely spacious, you can even entertain guests in there if you'd like lol I love the beds and pillows, extremely comfortable . I've been fortunate enough to stay in various different suites such as the Rialto ( bigger suite but a lot of space you can't do anything with...like a foyer, but hey...it certainly looks cool) prima suite...huge and you get a dining table which is pretty awesome if you're dining in (but really, you're in VEGAS...why are you dining in??) My personal favorite is the renaissance suite, as of right now it is the most magnificent suite i've stayed at in Las Vegas I mean seriously there is a bench in the shower AND a jet tub, TVs everywhere, huge living room so you can throw your own after party,  and spectacular views. The customer service at the Venetian is unparalleled (unlike at Cosmo, where it sucks even if you're an identity member but the hotel is cool so whatever )they definitely care about their guests and the experience their guests have when staying here. They are fast, efficient, and extremely polite. Never had a problem. I prefer not to stay at their Venezia tower because it's too far of a walk, but on the bright side Bouchon is also located right around there and that is one of my favorite brunch spots. If you're in a rush you can always grab coffee and a snack at the express Bouchon. I've been to Grand Lux cafe over 15 times because the hours and great and it's extremely convenient(there's one right by the casino at Venetian, and one at Palazzo(lol a little excessive but hey, when in Rome...) also you can't really go wrong with cheesecake factory ( grande lux is owned by them) I love their beignets in the morning. Sushi Samba over at Palazzo is a very eclectic restaurant, like Brazilian Japanese fusion, if you like sushi i would definitely give it a try.  I love the yard long margaritas at Lime Ice as well. The Grand Canal shops are conveniently located (THE SEPHORA IS HUGE!) Walgreen's is great to stop by and pick up the necessities you forgot at home (don't go to the Apothecary shop by the room elevators, its 9 dollars for toothpaste lol crazyy) I've only ever been on one Gondola ride , very cute photo opportunity and you get to feel European for half an hour ( but if you're a gambler you might consider it a waste of time, just sayin) My favorite part is coming during the holiday season and enjoying the annual "Winter in Venice" Festivities.Beautiful decorations all around the resort, and New Years eve fireworks are a sight for sore eyes and the huge Christmas tree is beautiful. don't skip out on the ice skating, it really is a lot of fun. If you're more of a summer person have no fear, you will not be bored. I'm not crazy about Tao and Tao beach club but a lot of my friends enjoy the parties and DJs there. I prefer the relaxed spa like environment of "Azure Luxury Pool.' Hmm what else..THE CASINO(how could I forget??!) is lively and huge, the tables are packed on hectic weekends but then again that's common to all the good casinos. Waitresses pass by often for drink orders , never waited for than 15 minutes. If you have kids or you don't like to gamble and need a day time activity check out Madame Tussaud's wax museum and check out the creepily funny replicas , people come by from all over Vegas to go there so might as experience it if it's right under your nose. I could go on raving about this place in it's entirety but i'm sure you get the point, there is so much to do and you won't regret staying here. If you  gamble, make sure to sign up for Grazie, they are by far the best player's club in Las Vegas..best perks including triple point weekends and you can use your points at the gift events for top notch stuff, I got an iPad and a Michael Kors wallet..not bad at all ;)
I am typing this from the 12th floor of the Venetian tower.  The room is gorgeous and clean and big.  I really wish I could stop here and live happily ever after on my vacation but I have been here only a few hours and am very unimpressed with the customer service in this hotel.  My first clue should have been when I called a couple days before our trip to see if we could get some special accommodations for a medical issue I have.  The woman that answered the phone was very unapologetically not helpful.  My husband then called the concierge thinking being in the customer service only business would certainly yield better results.  She was unable to help without a $70 per day charge, which would be fine but, again, she was very unapologetic and flippant. . . Today, after we went through the, in my opinion, tacky, line to get to check in we were told of a $28 per day resort fee.  RESORT FEE!  For use of the pool and fitness room!  I don't need the fitness room and I have never had to pay to use a hotel's pool.  This vacation was given to us from a friend along with a stipend that I planned to use on some spa services but now, since I HAVE to pay (no option to opt out) a resort fee that will equal $140 I won't be indulging.  Again, the employee was totally flippant and could have cared less that I was taken aback at the charge.  . . Also, as said in previous reviews, the refrigerator in the room is weight censored.  I get that.  I have stayed in many hotels that have the censors so they can charge what you use.  If you even pick anything up to look at it or set anything on or in it you will be charged!!  I am aghast at that kind of treatment of guests.  I do not feel special here at all.  . . I have 5 days here.  I hope they end up better than they started.  As of right now I will definitely not be staying here or recommending it to anyone.  It is a shame because when I told people I was staying at the Venetian everyone was impressed and really thought it was fancy.  The appearance is fancy.  How they treat their guests is a completely different thing altogether.. . Edited -  After a little more research on the resort fee we went to customer service in the morning and it was taken off.  She also accommodated us in letting us use the refrigerator free of charge for medical purposes.  Also a guest services  representative, Francesca, called this afternoon to make sure everything was satisfactory with us now.
Willkommen im der Scheinwelt vom Venetian !!! Das Hotel selbst ist wirklich nobel und lasst kaum Wunsche offen. Unsere kleine Suite hatte ca 65 qm, ein Riesenbett, ein separater Wohnbereich, gleich drei Fernseher, uppige Minibar ( wie alles hier relativ teuer), Bad mit Dusche und Wanne. Die Toilette ist abgetrennt davon.., . . Zu den Zimmern sowie den zwei Pool Bereichen kommt man nur an der Security vorbei (Zimmerkarte vorzeigen). Finde ich personlich gut gelost.. . Essen und trinken kann man 24 Stunden. Daneben gibt es eine Vielzahl von sehr hochpreisigen Restaurants. . . Casino ist wie uberall : bling bling, ratter, Larm, viele Menschen, Jubel, Frust.... . . Insgesamt finde ich Las Vegas mittlerweile wirklich teuer, aber wenn man es wie Eintrittspreise fur eine Show ansieht ist es wohl okay. Zwei bis drei Tage Scheinwelt reichen vollkommen ;-)
This was also wild! Take a gondola ride inside the mall area as your italian guide sings to you. Pretty cool stuff.
We stayed in a suite when we went to Vegas in this hotel. Honestly, I loved it! It was huuugee! We got the two door one, with marble flooring and bigger tvs. the living room felt like home. And the bathroom was just great! It is a little more expensive than other hotels here but I think it is worth it! Ours was 480 a night. Anyways the entrance hall  had acrobats too! And entertainers that dressed like the days of good old Shakespeare!  I Def. Can not wait to stay there again!
Beautiful casino, large guest rooms. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.   I am writing this complaint from a Venetian suite at approximately 4 am.  Why? Because I cannot sleep.  Why? Because my mattress is a sink hole.  Call the front desk you suggest? Been there and done that. I spoke to the night manager named Thomas who offered me his sincere condolences along with a promise to change the mattress in the morning.  So it seems I spent a fair amount of money to NOT sleep at a five star property that is nonchalant about providing the most basic comforts. Yes the casino is nice and the rooms are large but if the establishment is indifferent to it's customers....I'm not sure any of the rest matters.
We were celebrating our 1 year Wedding Anniversary and stayed here,the room was on the 27th floor,very classy,marble floor entry and in bathroom,several televisions and plenty of room with step down living room...Only complaints would be that the registration check in and hotels elevator to go to your rokm is way across the hotel!Also,you can hear people in hallway entering their rooms near you and the pool party music plays until 4 a.m...you can hear it in the distance...Valet does not get your vehicle by telephoning ahead,you must present the ticket and wait(15-20 minutes)The hotel should have water bottles at no charge,its pricey to have any refrig items.The a/c will freeze you so you will want to adjust the dial...Lol...All in all,it was a nice experience..we ate dinner at Morels Steakhouse(Another long walk across the casino to find it.
One of my favorite hotels on the strip. I like the venice theme. The food here is fantastic. The Grand Lux is basically a cheesecake factory ( i think they're related`). Rooms are always clean and comfy. I did venture downtown to check out a new show at the Plaza hotel called LIMELIGHT! loved it. Its what vegas shows are supposed to be like. In a city filled with cirque shows everywhere its nice to see high energy sexy dancing with real singers and comedy elements. Its only there for 2 months before they move on. Definitely check it out if you get a chance.
The best spa in all of Vegas! Couples massage was private and very intimate. Def a must do!
For the second time this place made unauthorized charges on my credit card after i checked out.  this also happened last year when they accused me of taking a bottle of water from the mini bar and i was billed $40.  Other Las Vegas hotels don't do this!
You get what you pay for is the perfect way to describe The Venetian. I've stayed here several times and have always had a wonderful experience. The gondola ride was fun,  but I recommend taking the one inside vs outside. The outside gondola ride is very short. The Venetian street performers are a cool bonus. Even though they have the Venice/Italian theme,  they have the best french macaroons I've ever had. Prior to moving to Vegas I'd stop by and pick some up whenever I was in town to bring home with me.
while sitting pool side I decided to read the reviews of the hotel. the room is outstanding, staff was helpful, and friendly. this is what everyone was saying. they all had ONE bad thing to say. Pool staff is terrible. we found out first hand.... boy are the reviews dead on !!!!. we spent most our day in the garden pool area, when we could find someone to take an order from us, she made me feel like I was putting her out. rude and surly !!! the only nice thing I can say.. Venetian, Please do your self a favor, GET SOME DECENT POOL STAFF. I don't mind paying $8.00 for a beer, but "put a smile on the person who's bringing it to me".
When I returned to my room at noon the next day the mattress had not been changed. I called the front desk and spoke to another manager. She was apologetic and far more accommodating. The mattress was changed. In fact both mattresses were changed. She waived the resort fee and comped a meal.  I appreciate the effort.
It's a beautiful hotel and yes, there are gondolas. And YES, they have arguably the best steakhouse in Las Vegas in Carnevino and one of my favorite all time restaurants Bouchon but damn does their casino floor suck the money right out of your wallet with the speed of a turbo charged vacuum cleaner. I've never, ever lost money so fast in any hotel casino floor. Ever. Ever. Ever. . . Walk around, eat, drink but run as fast as you can through the casino floor.
Venetian/palazzo are by far my fav hotels to stay at because all the rooms even the standard rooms are suites and bigger than your average hotel room on the strip, better that the Wynn! & good service too very clean
Beautiful hotel, gorgeous room. And very clean and fast room service!
Maybe I expected too much from what I have heard from other people.  I do not know.  I came to Vegas to get married and have a honeymoon.  People told me if I let the hotel know that they would make it special.  They did not do anything extra for us but then again they were not obligated to.. . What really reflected my rating of this place was the way they handled our air going out on us.  The room we stayed in had problems with the air not working.  This is an upscale expensive hotel so you would think they would have immediately moved us.  This is not the case.  The first night someone came and did something to the air which did not make much of a difference.  The second night we called again and once again someone was sent to our room.  This time the guy they sent told us he could not fix the problem with us still in the room as it would be noisy and take awhile.  We were moved into another room.  Once again, seeing as this is a pricey resort you would think for the inconvenience they would have moved us to a better room or did something nice.  If you think that you would be wrong.  We were moved to the same version of our suite even though we had to pack and move in the middle of the night.. . I just don't feel they did anything to try to wow us considering this is supposed to be an incredible place to stay.  It really was not.  They did remove the resort fee over the air but that was it.  I will say the place is beautiful...but I think the experience was lacking and would not stay there again.
