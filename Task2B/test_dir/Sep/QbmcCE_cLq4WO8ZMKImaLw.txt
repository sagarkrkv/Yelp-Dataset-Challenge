If you want to gorge yourself on a shitton of food, then this HHAGG is your place.. Located inside a maze of a hotel (I'll give them the fact that they're remodeling) we are seated in a strange room of booths. The interior is dim and uninviting.. . Our waiter was alright, but seemed a bit frazzled. He kept repeating the items I was ordering with different names than what I was reading off the menu. He also gave an air of irritation because I was just listing off the orders for everyone at the table.. . This place is the perfect example of quantity over quality.. . Although the food wasn't bad, it wasn't stellar and definitely not food that I'd recommend to others or return for. Sometimes having two huge heaping mounds of smoked salmon on giant biscuits and mashed potatoes is just TOO much. Even when shared amongst two people.. . The sage fried chicken was moist, but lacking in flavor. There was nothing special about the dish. I didn't taste any sage, the syrup was regular ole maple syrup. . . The style of hash was boring. Shredded dry meat. Potato cubes. It didn't hit the spot at all. And the gigantic looming biscuit was dry and brittle and really just a sponge to soak up any grease.. . For our party of 7, we were seated within 10 minutes on a Saturday morning around 9am.. . Maybe other locations in the chain are better, but this one I will not be returning to.
Most tourists decide where to eat because people rave about it on Yelp, and so did we. The food portion is huge! and the decoration is awesome, but I'd focus more on the taste.     I think what I ordered is HH original benedict, I know the waitress already told me it is different from the usual benedict because they use tomato sauce instead of hollandaise sauce and I still wanted to try. I don't knowwhat is wrong but they just don't seem right for me. The mashed potato was tasteless and didn't go well with the only sour tomato sauce, so as the biscuit. I expected more balanced flavor from the signature dish that represents the restaurant. My brother ordered corn hash beef with scrambled egg and said it's just bland and nothing special but the size.
This restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of The Quad. They're open 24hrs so if it's late in the night, this is one of the options you have. Decor is rustic with a lot of farming decorations.. . Our Order:. Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict: ($16.99) sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled Mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled Eggs served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes. Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower: ($17.50) Sage Fried Chicken stacked w/ bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks. Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade: $5.50. Iced Pistachio Mocha: $6.99. . WARNING: Portions here are HUGE!! It wasn't on Man vs. Food for a reason! I totally forgot how large the dishes are here and ordered too much as we were starving. First thing that came out of my mouth as it was placed in front of us, "OMG. What did we just do?!" As we were trying to tackle the dishes, we were watching other tables make the same mistake as we did and to hear their gasps were hilarious. We and most of the tables around us had to take the remainder of our orders to go. You have been warned!. . I wasn't a fan of the fried chicken that they're so famous for as I didn't really taste the sage and the batter was really thick. Since the chicken is covered in sauces, it's not going to be crispy so it's basically a bunch of mush when you dig into it. I had ordered the WaffleTower and was surprised that the bacon was actually INSIDE the waffle! I thought it would be layered between the waffles or bits sprinkled around.. but nope! Very nicely toasted so it had the slight crunch that I enjoy in my waffles (but still soft and airy on the inside). I also liked the biscuit in the Chicken Benedict as it was quite flavorful, soft, and slightly crumbly. Both dishes were merely ok in their entirety though.. . In the Iced Pistachio Mocha, you're able to taste the pistachio but since I love the flavor, I would've liked it if it was stronger. It's mostly a sweet drink though so wouldn't say it's strong in the caffeine department. . . What I'd definitely would come back for is the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade. It's so refreshing and sounds like a weird combination, but it's so good! I had the non-alcoholic version but next time I'll try their alcoholic one (if it's not too early in the day though).. . The waitress that assisted us was cheery and friendly. We came here on a Friday afternoon around 2PM so it wasn't very crowded. Fairly easy to flag someone down when we needed something.. . Having tried their famous dishes, I wouldn't order them again as there are so many other options to try. Hopefully I'll remember to share a dish the next time I come though!
Wait time was about 20 minutes. 15 mins shorter than what we were told so that's a plus. Seated & food came out promptly so another plus. Ordered the infamous chicken and waffles (a man vs food fav). Didn't really like it tho. I won't say that it's nasty but I just think it's a preferential taste. I didn't like the taste of the chicken which was kinda soggy & the skin was just falling off. It also had no flavor to me. The waffles tasted kind of weird too. Idk, just didn't work for me. I should've gotten something else. The presentation was great though. And they give you a BUNCH of food. You probably won't eat all your food in one siting. So that's a plus. Not saying you want like the chicken & waffles tho, I just didn't like it.
We had a group of 15 for dinner!! The service was great with good banter and very helpful staff. . . The meals are HUGEEEEEEEEEE I'm not exaggerating.  HUGE! my husband and I shared the sage chicken benedict. We couldn't even finish it.  It was super tasty though! And it was so good even though we were stuffed we kept eating it. . . Highly recommend the cheese mash.... Holy crap it's good.. . The meatballs are sooooo flavourful. But if you want to challenge your friend to something they could never finish (like we did for a laugh)  the chicken and waffles are soooooooooooo big. God bless him he tried.... poor kid didn't stand a chance.  . . All in all it is reasonably priced. Every meal I saw could of easily been shared with 2 if not 3 people. Service with a smile. Good location in the quad hotel.
This was our first visit to Hash House a Go Go (HHAGG).  We were in Las Vegas, and enjoyed a late brunch on a Tuesday.  I had the Ham, Spinach and Cheddar scramble, and my wife had the Basic breakfast.  The scramble was very good -- the spinach was not a bit slimy and the ham and cheese were excellent.  Eggs were fluffy, and slightly moist.  The crispy potatoes were exactly as advrrtised and really good.  The biscuits were good, but very dry, and my wife's bacon was limp and very greasy.  The restaurant could use a more acoustically responsive ceiling.  This was one of the louder spaces we've encountered and it was a distraction.  All-in-all, I gave our experience 3 stars, but the food and the value for money is actually about 4 and a half stars.  We'll come back, and recommend this restaurant to others
Located inside the Quad or Old Imperial Palace or Future Linq. Second floor entrance off a set of elevators of its own near the center of the Casino.. . Tips: Come hungry and leave full as portions are country sized. Order a drink as the water is disgusting. . . Service and wait staff was friendly and not  prompt. We arrived early and seated before the breakfast rush. Food order was taken. Drinks refills for water and coffee came upon requesting.. . Tried one of the skillets. Skillet was warm, moist, flavorful seasoned, and delicious. Toast was burnt. Dishes are accented with wheat, sage, or various farm fair. Presentation is something to enjoy in it's own. . . Coffee was decent not stellar.. . Overall three stars. Good food and drink presentation. Service quality was not great nor bad. Willing to come back with an appetite.
There were a few things on my "Vegas" bucket list, and this was one of them.  I was so excited...so it may boil down to I had a HIGH expectation.  And truly, I vacillated between a 3 and 4*. . 1)  There is always and hour or more wait, and there are no light up thingies to let you know - so you either go and make the res, then gamble and come back - or you sit outside on your phone in the wait area.. 2)  The food is touted on Man v. Food (the special I chose), New York Times, and ABC's Nightline - but Ithink everyone brings their A-game for those folks...know whatta I mean?. 3)  It's pretty small - hence the wait.. . I ordered the Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict style:  layered:  red skin mashed potatoes, a large split homemade biscuit, soft style scrambled eggs, bacon, a chicken fried chicken breast (Andy Sage style), fresh spinach, tomatoes, and topped with mozzarella (mine was burnt), and chipotle sauce.  What I learned is that you must cut through all the layers and attempt to form "the perfect bite."  The first few of these were 1) unsuccessful 2) extremely delicious.  At this point, it began to turn into a huge pile of chipotle sogged biscuit, through which you dig to find nuggets of chicken fried chicken, spinach, or bacon.  (My suggestion is to make a dish with those three and keep the chipotle on the side).  Within minutes of eating a little less than half, I was very ill.  Now, this could ONLY be the food, and not the 17 or so vodka tonics from the night before...or the bloody mary I had while waiting.  Be warned. . . My companions had various versions of: flank steak, chunk hash browns, various veggies, and biscuit - and it all looked really messy and unappealing.  One friend had the BBLT (just add bacon to bacon), which comes on HUGE Texas toast, and she added a medium fried egg on the side.  That looked really good.  The service was outstanding and the time at the table, and getting out was pleasant, unrushed, and memorable (there were 7 of us).. . All in all, I'm so glad I had the experience, but I won't go through this kind of trouble for that kind of meal again.
I was super excited to try Hash House A Go Go. We had heard it was good for brunch and really good food. However we were turned off almost immediately. It is very difficult to find if you are just using a map app... we walked around for a good 20 mins before discovering it is inside the Quad, past some interior construction, and on the 2nd floor.. . When we finally got up to the restaurant, there were people everywhere waiting to be seated. There was no rhyme or reason to the wait area and it was difficult to find the host/hostess station. We inquired as to the wait (we were not greeted or anything) and the host didn't even look up and told us 25-40 minutes. He did not inform us of any drink specials we could have enjoyed while we waited - although I did see a sign on our way down the escalator. The lack of acknowledgment and enthusiasm made our decision easy: to see food elsewhere. Perhaps I will try this spot on my next trip to Vegas.
Bring your appetite because you will definitely need it if you come here. I ordered a salad and the chicken and waffles. The salad was overly drenched in dressing. Ask for the dressing on the side if you don't like your lettuce soggy.. . The biscuits were good. They were covered in honey butter and were the size of my fist. But....I'll admit they are nothing compared to the biscuits at Sweet Cheeks Q in Boston. . . By the the time I got through the salad and half of the biscuit the chicken and waffles was served. Holy... The waffles are made with bacon inside! Um, who was the genius who thought of that? This portion washuge and could definitely feed 2 people. . . Overall it was a decent meal and I had plenty of leftovers.
We arrived around 9 am with a 15 min wait, the service is slow however it is we'll worth the wait. We ordered the tractor combo which is a great amount of food, the Waffles are large and fluffy, the eggs and potatoes are plentiful, however, the fried chicken and mashed potatoes are the speciality. I would highly recommend at least one person in our party to order those items!! It's a must Go Go !!
This place was awesome. The portions are HUGE, i mean, enough for two people.
Amazing flavors and huge proportions! They just need to work on staffing better. Waited for 30+ minutes when there was clearly several empty tables. Our waiter was super friendly and gave great service!
Great food and excellent service!!! This place is a must-go for Las Vegas Breakfast.  Try the chorizo hash and of course the chicken and waffles.  There can be a wait but it's worth it.
Had to try the chicken and waffles because that's what people talk about. Impressed !! It's definently a shared meal unless your starving . Atmosphere is nice , waiters polite and sociable . Only knock I had was we were waiting on people from our party that was down stairs parking and they didn't sit us until everyone came . It's the policy . Must try tho when in Vegas .
This is the second time I visit this place and the quality of food was not the same as the first time. However, the plate presentation is still amazing!
One word- Awesome!!! The food was on point! The proportions...well let's just say that I 100% guarantee that you will not leave dissatisfied or hungry in any way. I felt like a glutton and loved it!! Merica!! Service was decent- not award winning but not bad. Overall I left this place as a happy camper in a food coma.
This place was good. Defiantly could share food. The wait for our food was a bit long.
Located inside the Quad Hotel, it can be a little difficult to find, but it is so worth the search. After hearing that the portions here were pretty generous, we were hesitant about whether to order two separate dishes or split one between the two of us. . We ended up ordering Andy's Sage Fried Chicken ($14.99), a plate that contained all of the food groups I can think of. A delicious concoction of crispy, double-fried chicken with their delicious hash browns, a kick of chipotle with a biscuit, this plate can be easily shared by a very hungry couple.. The service was fantastic - our server Billy was sincere, funny and attentive, showing us what true American hospitality is about.. I highly recommended this gem of a brunch spot if you're in Vegas - skip the pricey hotel buffet and get a fresh and delicious dish here. The coffee is small at $3 here, but it's super fresh with bottomless refills.
Never had a bad meal here. Only bad thing was the food took over 40 mins to get to the table.
One of those places where there's a line to put your name on the waitlist - crazy! Make sure you're not in a rush when you come here otherwise you won't be in a good mood to eat! Put your name on the list then go enjoy the casino but make sure to come back a little early because I think they quote their wait time a little longer.. . My friend and I split the sage chicken benedict. I'm a sucker for all eggs benedict dishes. However, it's not a benedict because the eggs aren't poached, but the scrambled eggs were pretty good! It was a huge sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, bacon, tomato, mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs served on a biscuit with mashed potatoes. I wasn't able to finish my half of the meal it was so large! . . I wasn't blown away by the taste of the food, but the size was pretty enormous. I'll be back to try their sage chicken waffles next time!
Excellent food and attentive staff. Large portions so sharing should be considered. Definitely a great spot to get breakfast in Vegas.
Every time I come to this place I feel like they reword or remove something that I like from the menu, never the less I always leave this place completely satisfied. . If you never been to this place it's a must. Enjoy
Steak and eggs special is great... it comes with of course steak and eggs... some mashed potato concoction that is out of this world... loved it...I'm not one for mashed potatoes but this was really really good and a huge biscuit which they offer with butter and strawberry jam... I actually ate the biscuit for the strawberry jam... And a little side of fruit... All this for 14.99!!! I'm definitely coming back... oh and it's open 24/7!!!
So I got a two for one dinner coupon and had my heart set on the fried chicken and waffles.  . . Damn, that portion was just ridiculous.  Chicken was crisp and juicy.  Even the breast meat.  I don't even remember the meatloaf but I think it was good too.  . . Three ladies shared that and the meatloaf entree and I swear, we could've fed our husbands/bfs with that amount of food.. . Who eats this much???  . . Welcome to 'Merica.  . . Oh yeah, service was awesome!  Even though I had a coupon, he didn't make a big deal like some places would.  Well done!
This place is a must try. I came in during breakfast and there was a wait. 20 minutes.. Their servings are big, so I do suggest you share with someone. My bf and I shared the rosemary chicken waffle thing, and the friend chicken was so good. Best fried chicken I have ever had. MUST MUST MUST TRY!. The service and staff was great, very friendly. It does get loud and very busy though.
Soo after a long night/morning came here food was great service was ok and the drinks yesss drinks 7.:00am still drinking they sucked had our waiter change it three different time still sucked !! But the waiter was cool about sooo two thumbs up to the food three thumbs up to the waiter
Came here for the Sage Fried Chicken Waffle Tower.  First time eating the entire day (it was approx. 12pm) and it was amazing.  I literally stuffed myself and I shared the dish with my husband.  Definitely worth trying it out.  We will be returning for sure on my next trip to Vegas.  Service was cool, no complaints.
This place is awesome. First time in Vegas and I've heads about this place and it was amazing. You want breakfast? COME HERE! PERIOD!!!!
How have I not known, until now, that this hidden gem existed??!! Located on the 2nd floor of the newly opened Quad Hotel Hash House A Go Go has been here for 6+ years back in the Imperial Palace hotel days... . We showed up on a late Saturday morning and while the wait was long (about 40 minutes) the food and service was well worth every minute! Hash House has an extensive menu but we opted for two house favorites: Sage-fried chicken and waffles with fried leeks and upside down chicken pot pie. And talk about portions?! They are HUGE!!! It was quite entertaining to watch table after table be served their meals and to see the camera flash bulbs going off with people wanting to capture the artistry on their plate- me included. . The sage-fried chicken and waffles with fried leeks was truly heaven on a plate! I have always wanted to try chicken and waffles and this was definitely the right place to be sucked into that world. The fried chicken was flavorful and juicy and the fried leeks?? Yes, I was skeptical about fried leeks but they were simply divine. They weren't overpowering and complimented the sage flavoring of the chicken breading well. . The chicken pot pie was a marvel in its own right. Served with the crust on the side versus on the top/bottom allows you to enjoy every aspect of a chicken pot pie from the first bite to the last. . Hash House is definitely a place to seek out and savor!
Nothing but good things to say! We recently visited Vegas and actually ate twice. First time with a large crowd of about 20. No issues accommodating us. Favs --chizoro house hash and the chicken house hash. The brown sugar flapjack was amazing!  Unbelievable bangfor your buck!
Server was not very considerate and constantly trying to rush us for brunch. I ordered the roasted chicken, peppers, asparagus, and rosemary hash with egg whites and half order of potatoes. Alright quality, way too much oil and not much added flavor/spice. Portion wasn't what I expected (yes, even though I got 1/2 potatoes). However, my friend got a pancake that was ENORMOUS. I tried it and it was very good and cooked perfectly. Perhaps I just got a subpar dish for this place or I was expecting more, but overall I was not impressed and would have been more pleased at a Waffle House (from Georgia).
Oh My Great Food Coma!  . . Huge fan of huge portions of great food.. On this trip to Vegas for the Bodybuilding convention and was on the hunt for brunch.  After a Epic fail at another eating establishment......we were excited to come here.  We got the 411 from some local friends in the area.   A little hard to find, but worth every bite.  . . The food is so flavorful, satisfying and leaves you wanting more. Have no fear, take it home and eat some for lunch!  . . Huge portions.....no seriously they're huge.  Bodybuilders even said it was huge but finished everything and were still hungry about 3 hours later. This place is right up there with the Griddle Cafe in LA.  This will be a place I come visit more often.  . . - Cara
Can you say amazing? I stayed in the quad and this was recommended by a friend of mine. I didn't have high expectations for this place but it blew my mind. Our server was great. I had the Kokomo and I've literally been dreaming about it ever since. The fries were fresh and hot and just freaking perfect. I can't wait to go back. My next vacation will be somewhere near a Hash House.
This place was great! It was a little crowded when I went but it was well worth the wait. You must bring your apatite because the serving sized are huge.
As a person who doesnt like to waste money, or enjoy crappy food.  I always like to try new places out especially in Vegas and when I  randomly came across this place so I was instantly kind of skeptical.  Especially since it was located in imperial palace and i hadnt really noticed a major advertisement for it before. If you've ever seen a Great and glorious fast food ad on tv or online with the delicious mouth watering food and then once you get there and take your order it looks like someone beat your burger with their fist and just flung it in a bag and you was hungry half an hour later and you spent $20-30.. Well Once i googled a few images and menu I figured why not try it out. I didnt post a picture because my pictures will look just like everyone elses or I can say just like their appear on any internet search. Definitely not a false advertisement on that. This has by far been one of my Top places to go to in Vegas and Chicago regardless of the day, time or week. I have tried the majority of the menu or seen a friend try it like the burgers the size of your head stuffed wit mash or what ever else, the Dinner plate sized tenderloin sandwich, Chicken & waffles, the Kokimo and a few more.. Definitely worth the wait in line, the money and the couple hours spent trying to finish.. The only reason It wasnt 5 stars was because I'm a super harsh critic and a place would have to be the greatest thing on earth for 5 stars (or maybe i'm nitpicking) but I'm just saying little super minor things could be better like saying out of 10 its a 9.8. This place how ever is very very close: Good food, Not to much on the pockets, will have left overs, good service, good atmosphere, hope they'll add more to the future menu. . Major Rule #1: Try not to eat ANY! thing before coming here.. Even on an empty stomach you may not finish it all but give it try anyway. Major Rule #2: Try not to eat here BEFORE! going out on the town..  you'll probably be to full to drink, dance, hang out an/or just sleepy as hell, full an ready to lay down
We have a Hash House in San Diego and the wait is always over 2 hours. I did it once, and swore I'd never do it again. Because I refuse to do the wait, when we were in town visiting, my fiance wanted to give Hash House a try since he's never been. . . We came in on a Friday around 12 PM for brunch. We were quoted about 25 minutes before we could be sat. What's awesome about this location is that they have a bartender by the hostess who can make you drinks while you wait for  your table so you don't have to go up to the bar. I liked this idea!. . Since there was open seating at the bar, we decided to just hop up there and opt out of waiting for a table. I warned him that the portions are HUGE and since I didn't feel like walking out of there in a food coma, we should just share a plate. Judging by the two men seatednext to us who looked like they were struggling to get another bite down, he decided to take my advice (smart guy lol).. . We both ordered up Bloody Mary's- which were perfect- not too much horseradish ( I hate horseradish so the fact that it was in there and I couldn't taste it, was awesome), and perfectly spicy. Of course my fiance opted to "man" up his Bloody Mary and ordered the BLT Bloody Mary.. . We decided to share the chicken and waffles. The waffles had a strip of bacon in the center, another bonus for all you bacon lovers out there. The sage fried chicken was good, but the sage was WAY too over powering. . . Overall, it was decent- nothing crazy. The portion sizes are what draws people in but the taste is meh. . . I probably won't be back unless I'm with a group of people who absolutely insist on coming and even then- I'd probably just order a bloody marry.. Oh, a plus is the bartenders kicked ass! Great energy, great customer service!
I had to deduct another star this visit for the entirely underwhelming service. The food came through yet once again, but from the moment we had human interaction with this place, it was just unfortunate. The hostesses seemed to have an attitude and took forever to arrange our table in a completely empty restaurant and our server took forever and just seemed to be going with the motions. Not that I need to be entertained, but be friendly, you're a server. If all we had to do was eat amazing food, this place would get five stars.
Over hyped. There I said it. Don't be hating, I just wasn't blown away and after seeing words like ''amazing'', ''exceptional'' and ''spectacular'' appearing in so many reviews I did expect more than the very average tasting Chicken and Waffles I had. Ok, portions are huge but that is the exact reason why America has an obesity problem. Half the portions, increase the quality and you're onto a winner Hash House.. . Located inside The Quad this place is a bitch to find. It's on the 2nd floor and accessible from an escalator in a dark corner of the ground floor, you really have to be paying attention to the signs and directions.. Once inside the place is large and the staff inviting. The menu consists of Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch and Dinner with your usual American fare. Knowing from the Yelp pictures before we came the portions were big we decided to order just one Entree to share and see how we go with that before ordering more.. . - Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=WMlwV0h4FJ210s5htktfYg#qbOfWBSEnFvS3S5Kvu9uBA) The Waffles have Bacon cooked into them and comes with Leeks. The presentation was great, piled high and held together with a huge steak knife, truly a beast of a meal.. My Husband and I found the Chicken to be a little dry and the coating oily. It also had a strong flour taste where too much had been used before the egg wash and crumb coating. The Waffles and Syrup were good if you took out the Bacon (consisted of more fat than meat) and the Leeks really added nothing to the dish, do people even eat them?. The portion was large enough for Breakfast between two of us though as we didn't even manage to finish it, how one person could eat that much in one sitting is beyond me.. . Bottom line? Disappointing experience, I'm glad I did come here after wanting to for so long but am not likely to return. I guess it's the kind of place you come once just to say you have been. . . Probably more 2.5 / 5. I'm too generous...
I'll knock off 0.5 star for being in the pretty meh Imperial Palace... and another 0.5 star for the massive wait most people have to go through to eat here.. . This place is pretty top notch.  I had eaten at the one out in 'Vegas' Vegas and when on a tiny trip up here for the May 2012 solar eclipse I ate breakfast at this location.. . Their food is massive... the price isn't cheap... but it's really good.. . Get up a bit early and get in here before the crowds show up.  It'll be a tasty filling breakfast!
I had heard so much about this place, so even though we were both starving , we endured a 30 minute wait and it was definitely worth it. Service was efficient and fun, the atmosphere is upbeat and then the food. Wow are these some big plates! Had the chorizo jalapeno hash, the chorizo is made in house and is a perfect balance of flavor and heat, without the overuse of salt that so often happens, served over crispy potatoes it was delicious. My wife had the sage chicken which is HUGE! Flavor again was superb, but unless you have a huge appetite, get this one to share. All around a great place and the best breakfast I have found so far in Vegas.
This place is AMAZING!!!!  Customer service was EXCELLENT. The food DELISH!!!  Portion sizes MORE THAN A MEAL!!!! A return visit is in order.
Absolutely my favorite foody spot in vegas! The girls & i decided to come here because of previous friends who have visited all said that this was the place to go! Boy, they were so right! We came here after the nightclub due to the fact that they are really busy during lunch time & were packed but since they are open 24/7 we came late night. . We were told that two plates were they most well known plates that were famous so of course me & the girls decided to get our own plate. (Andy's Sage fried chicken, Chicken & waffles, & corned beef hash) Our server warned us before ordering that one pate is enough share for the three of us but we were hungry & were careless of what she said. Few moments later when the food arrived we all looked at each other & said she was right we should have ordered only two plates. Several spoon fulls later we were so stuffed & barely even put a dent on our plates!. The service was great! but what was even better was the food (quality & taste)! Our bill was nothing compared to the buffet prices too! You really do get a bang for your buck here! I promise you, you will leave feeling fully satisfied & taste buds feeling tingly from the rich sauces & ingredients. We left here fully satisfied & our tummy's full! I will be making sure to stop by here every time we hit up vegas!
I ordered the Sage Chicken and Waffles to go. They served it to me in a pizza box since it was the only container large enough to hold everything! . . When I took one bite of the fried chicken, I thought I was struck by lightning. The chicken was deliciously seasoned while being unbelievably moist. I tried to commit the flavor to memory, just so I can try to make it at home!. . The waffles though, were not as good. They were normal, dry waffles that one would expect. The difference was that these waffles had bacon inside. It was a unique style of preparation, but I could have done without them. . . As for the sauteed leeks, I didn't really understand why they were part of the dish. But hey, I like leeks, so I'm not going to complain about them. . . Quick note about the amount of patrons. I visited at noon and there were about 30 people in line, waiting for a table. I decided to come back at 3pm, when there was no line and the restaurant was empty. If you're not in the mood to wait, I recommend showing up at the restaurant in the mid-afternoon. . . Overall, I paid 21 dollars for this giant meal and was satisfied. I'm definitely going to try the chicken pot pie when I visit this place again!
Ordered sage chicken and waffles and chicken Benedict.  Chicken and waffle was watever but the chicken benedict was awesome! .  We shared (3people) couldnt finish both plates.
Heard good things about this place, but the portions are way too big.  The sage fried chicken and waffles were good.  Just too much for one person and you will get tired of it.  We got here early so there was no wait, but the waiter looked flustered when they were still slow.  Messed up my friends order 3 time....
Went for breakfast with the family.  Busy but reasonable wait considering.   Coffee was fresh, Starbucksblend and the server made sure it was never empty.  I ordered the Chroizo Jalapeno hash while the missus got the meatloaf has with sausage gravy for the biscuit.   Served hot and made to order with fresh ingredients.  Chorizo had robust flavor that complemented the cheddar and potatoes.  The missus' meat loaf have wonderful texture and subdued flavors.  Biscuits are huge and fluffy and the gravy is amazing.  Will go back for the chicken and waffles or the vanilla waffles next time.  Wonderful food, good value but not quiet!
The best biscuits and gravy I've ever had
Yesterday breakfast was exquisite. THANK YOU Hash House A Go Go. . . .. . Walking toward the hostess I noticed There was a wait which usually means the food is great. Only a 5 minute wait.  I was very pleased and excited because I could see a bar. Most breakfast places forget about us alcoholics. Haha. . My date ordered me The BLT Bloody Mary. I was very impressed. It was delivered quickly and tasted delicious. I was quite pleased with the appearance as well. Bacon, lettuce, tomato served in the glass and toast on the side.  . I will definitely be dining there again.
