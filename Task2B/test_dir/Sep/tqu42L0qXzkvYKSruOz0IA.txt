An hour long wait on a Saturday night for sub par food. They're obviously understaffed. But apparently steak and eggs are good. I don't know, I had the dry chicken and portobello mushrooms.
EGGcelent breakfast. Cheap and tasty. But the bacon was pretty bad, dunno how you can mess up on bacon. Cheap er than breakfast on the strip. Our waitress was kinda slow and poorly attentive. Maybe she was super busy... but I'd come back here for sure.
So seriously My friend was skeptical that She would like the food judging from the way the place looks, but I posited that all these positive reviews can not be wrong; but ultimately, I made an executive decision to dine here & have their popular prime rib.  I ordered the spicy chicken wings for appetizer.  Let me say that 1 bite of the wings & my friend was sold.  She conceded that the Yelpers were right, the food was good.  I cautioned that we haven't tasted the prime rib yet to which she said she didn't have to because the wings were "that good."  Well, as expected the prime rib was excellent!  I wish they had a better wine list because I prefer a nice bottle of red wine to go with the red meat, especially one as good as this cut.  Oh well, I'll bring my own bottle next time.
I came to Ellis Island with my wife today on the advice of a friend who recommended the prime rib here. As soon as we walked into the Cafe we were greeted right away by a very friendly hostess and immediately sat at a booth. Our server came around promptly asking for drinks and any appetizers.  Once we had a few minutes to look over the menu, I put in an order for the King's Cut Prime Rib meal which included a choice of one the house brewed beers.  I chose the light beer to go with my meal. My wife  ordered the onion ring appetizer, and the shrimp scampi meal.  The wait time for our meal to arrive I would consider normal, as with the appetizers too.  Our server came around frequently for refills on my water and my wife's iced tea. . Once our meals arrived to our table, we immediately noticed that the shrimp scampi plate my wife ordered resembled soup. It had an overwhelming amount of oil left on the plate. The shrimp were large and butterfly cut, but were indeed overcooked as they were extremely rubbery. The overall taste of the scampi dish was on the bland side. Less oil, more garlic, salt, and herbs are expected.. My dish, the Kings Cut Prime Rib was a decent sized portion. Cooked to order (which was medium) and it was served hot. My meal included a baked potato and garlic green beans which were quite tasty. My only gripe was that the roasted outer portion of my prime rib needed much more salt and pepper to balance out the seasonings. . . The house brewed light beer was excellent!!  It was not heavy at all as I drank this while eating my hearty meal. I need to also mention that the appetizer we ordered (onion rings) were very tasty.  It was a smooth flavorful batter that was not breaded. We really enjoyed munching on them!  . Overall our experience was "middle of the road" (hence the 3 stars) as far as the execution of the food. The service was prompt, attentive, courteous, and friendly. The dining area was clean and well organized.  Parking was not any hassle as we found an open spot immediately. I would return again, but perhaps try something else on the menu...most definitely getting a few more pints of their brew!!
Four pieces of delicious fried chicken, steak fries, home-made slaw, pint of house IPA, $9.99, including tax.
Great place for Barbecue! Old-style casino, dark and close but really quite neat! Great food and great prices in their restaurants. Beer's top-notch and cheap. Somewhat noisy but, what do you expect for a casino!! It's a great value all-around! Have fun!
This is one of those places we have to come to every time we come out to Vegas. I've noticed in recent years it has definitely become more busy, which is good for them but unfortunate for me and having to wait. It is barely off the strip, but definitely worth driving to or hopping in a cab....even walk to it if you're the ambitious type!. . For the price you get a good amount of food and good tasting food too. I've never tried the beer, which is brewed on site, but I've heard great things. I have had their root beer which is also brewed here and it is pretty good.. . All in all if you are looking for a place for some good food and at a good price this is the place for you.
I always love myself a GREAT deal and Ellis Island definitely has won me over.  After Drai's we were wanting a good and inexpensive steak and eggs.  Luckily before hopping into the cab, the attendant had recommended Ellis Island, especially after I told him we were interested in going to Marilynn's for the steak and eggs.  Thanks to that kind gentleman, I now have a new place to go to for $5.99 steak and eggs.  Service was quick and kind, and the steak and eggs wasn't so bad either.  The potatoes could have been better, but because of the great deal, it didn't matter so much to me.  It's not stated in the menu that the steak and eggs is $5.99 but it is.  Ellis Island, I'll gladly spend any buzzed evenings happily eating breakfast with the light entertainment of karaoke singing in the background.
The meat taste awesome!!! It's not as fancy but great place to eat!! I would definitely recommend this place to my family and friends
Oh. Em. Gee.. . Who would think mere 11.99 could get you a full New York steak and fried shrimps with salad and rice, in a casino around the strip? I read the Yelp reviews but was skeptical until I saw it myself. It was true!. . It was a decent meat with a decent portion for the price. Not a cheap junk. I even took out leftover with a box!. . One downside of this place is the long wait - it took 30 minutes to be seated. But now I know why.
Great food and prices! The casino doesn't hurt either . Karaoke is popular so beware you will run into a lot of people who think they can sing or just enjoy making a spectacle of themselves!
Worst restaurant ever! Stay away... corned beef straight out of the can... old stale toast... and gross slices of cheese on an omelet. Also bring a snack, you will be waiting at least 30 minutes for your food!
Hands down best chicken fried steak I've ever had in my life - you also can't beat the portion size and the price. $7.99 for the best breakfast ever. $2.25 huge beers. The waitress was extremely friendly and personable. I would definitely eat here again!
Finalmente grazie a yelp abbiamo mangiato benissimo spendendo poco ! super consigliato! Ottima carne cucinata benissimo , ottima anche la birra artigianale ...unica pecca non avevamo capito cos'era la root beer e non ci e piaciuta ...ma il resto super ok! personale gentilissimo e servizio veloce... Poi se fai la tessera del casino,che e gratis, hai dei coupon...noi abbiamo mangiato bistecca con patate e birra tutto a 8.99$!! Ottimo!
Best Chicken and Ribs in town that I have found so far.  They are open 4pm to 10pm every day and some days are more crowded then other but the food is amazing.. . The prices did go up from when I first started coming here, over the years, the price went from $8.99 for half a chicken and half a slab of ribs to $13.99 for the same plate.  You also get two small ears of corn, bread, cole slaw and beans.  Not a bad price for the amount of food you get even though it went up.. . The food is still amazing and worth stopping in.  This is a local place and when not real crowded, you can survive here without being smoked, meaning when you leave you don't smell like smoke.  They may have redone their ventilation system here or it just was not crowded on this particular visit, either way, it was great and I recommend this place to anyone who wants to venture out and try some great food.
This place was awesome. Great food at a great price. The services was good. Could have used the server stopping by a couple more times since we were a large group.. . If you are looking for a cheap place to eat with great food, this is a place to try.
The steak was the best we had in Vegas.  I can't wait until next time and I won money at the casino.  5
Ellis Island is awesome too going to have a nice dinner of BBQ ribs and chicken the food is great and the servers are very friendly and intent to serve food is almost too much for one person if you get the half slab of ribs and have a barbecue chicken the atmosphere is friendly and inviting and I always enjoy going there
Had an excellent breakfast at Ellis Island Casino, recommend the Steak and Eggs woooow $5.99 awesome!!! And were not talking a Minny steak, its a New Yaaorrk style!! Loved it, the 45 min. wait was worth it hint hint!
