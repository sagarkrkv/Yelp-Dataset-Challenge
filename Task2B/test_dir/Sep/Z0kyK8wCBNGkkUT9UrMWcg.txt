Came to Del's for my birthday dinner this year.  We arrived early thinking we would get a drink at the bar.  Their VIP drink is my favorite drink ever.  To our surprise we were seated immediately.  Service was terrific.  Several staff members checked on us and wished me a happy birthday.  Everything on the menu looked so good we ordered way more food then we could eat.  We started with crab cake, seafood soup and Caesar salad.  For mains we got shrimp scampi and bone-in rib eye.  Lobster mac and cheese, chateau potatoes and onion rings were the sides.  Our food was excellent.  I would pass on the seafood soup and onion rings next time though.  Nothing wrong with them, just personal preference.  We finished the meal with a complimentary slice of their famous lemon cake and a card signed by the staff.  A few days later we got a thank you card in the mail from our server.  That was a first for me.  I'm sure they make her do it but it was still a nice touch.  Overall, Del's is a solid choice for an off strip steakhouse.. . . Oh and at Thanksgiving you order to-go side dishes!
Every single second of this dining experience was top notch.. It started with a complimentary shot (it was my birthday) of their house specialty VIP Martini which was mandarin vodka soaking in fresh pineapple - Yummy!. I had the $49 house special which includes Salad, Side & Steak.  I upgraded my steak to a bone in fillet and it was amazing. . This place specializes in bone in cuts of meat and i recommend that is what you order.. The mac-n-cheese is a must order and its a huge portion (easily feeds 3-4) The mashed taters are also very large in portion.. Plan on spending some time here- They want you to stay relax and enjoy.. Plan on spending some $$$ but its well worth it.
Big surprise no one has contacted me to follow up. A woman from corporate emailed me on yelp asking for my number and never called. . . Truly impressed with their complete disregard to protecting their patrons and following up with something that effects every guest.
Walked in after a show and enjoyed a great experience. The entire staff were friendly and our server Carly was fantastic -great personality! If you are not on a time constraint take time to enjoy a cocktail before dinner. The Manhattan and bourbon berry ginger beer cocktail were spot on. If you like crab cakes, the appetizer with Cajun lobster sauce added the right amount of spice & flavor to a seafood favorite.  We enjoyed the 32 oz tomahawk chop & filet trio -which were well cooked and seasoned. The tomahawk was perfectly seared. There were big chunks of lobster in the lobster mac & cheese -delicious! Oh and if you are a true meat connoisseur the bone marrow butter is not to be missed. If you have room for dessert the lemon cake and espresso martini will complete the experience.
Love love this place! My family took me for my BD when we . Were in town. I had the best steak & since I am unable to eat . Gluten, which our waiter picked up on I received sorbet with a candle.. I would highly recommend del Friscos if your in Vegas!
Filet bone in was crazy good ..,!!!!  Special cut was awsome ... . Good job .,!!!
This was a fabulous experience. I can't say enough good things about Del Frisco's. The service was spectacular and the food was delicious. It was my husband's 30th birthday and they helped me make it extra special.
I haven't been to a steakhouse in quite some time and this looked like . The one to "set it off " . . The appetizer menu is one of the best I've ever encountered it was tough to choose one but I buckled down and went with the fried oysters they serve big portions and. It was the best fried oysters I've ever had . Also had a couple bites of the crab in lobster sauce it was excellent . . Main course is simple get anyone of the steaks on the menu . I got the tomahawk for 2 it was really good . Remember its a steakhouse GET a steak don't get cute. My side was onion rings and they knocked them out of the park . They are big huge gigantic etc.. . Dessert is no joke in here they got two that really caught my eye. The 7 layer lemon cake and banana bread pudding . I was able to have both and it was close but where can you find . Banana bread pudding that's the winner . . Time to act : Your role = Be a tourist . When you go here say you are a tourist . Trust me they will treat you better . Say you are catching a show later . So they don't take forever . . . Yes this is a 5 star but there was something a little off
Excellent in every form. Two visits in three days. Would eat here every day if I could! Everything is cooked and prepared to perfection.
This place is great. The Prime Rib Eye Bone In was ridiculously good and cooked to perfection. Be sure to get the dozen oysters, six is not going to be enough when they are that good. Chopped salad was dressed perfect and you can taste all the ingredients. We finished with the Lemon Cake and could not have been more pleased.  Get off the strip and go here.
Was in Vegas this past weekend for a girlfriend's bacherloette party.  She wanted have a nice dinner so one of the girls planned and reserved Friday night at this steakhouse for the 7 of us.  We actually arrived 1/2 an hour late, but called them and they were ok with it.  Once we arrived, we were seated immediately and the hostess was so gracious and professional. . . Once we were seated, we ordered a pitcher of their special drink (vodka infused with pineapple juice), really good and I would definitely recommend this. Steaks are usually too big for me since I'm small so I decided to split with my sister and we all shared different sides.  We ordered:. - Porterhouse - medium rare - this was so delicious and the cut and cook was perfect for the both of us to share.  It was tender and juicy and one of my favorite cuts now. . - mushrooms - really juicy and enough to share for the 7 of us, they brought out extras just in case. - creamed spinach - this was my least favorite, it was a bit on the salty side so I barely touched it. - broccoli - this was simple steamed broccoli with butter. - mashed potatoes - this was my favorite side, it was so good that I couldn't stop eating it.  We all loved it.. . We had so much fun and enjoyed our food here.  The ambiance is wonderful and the staff was a lot of fun and made us feel welcomed.  I heard they are opening one in Irvine, CA, so I will try that location the next time I come visit.
