The only time I eat a pound plus of food is when I come here! My favorite thing to get is the One Pound bag of Shrimp, Hot N Juicy Special flavor, Extra Spicy. I've tried the other different flavorings but this is by far my favorite. They also have clams, oysters, crab legs, french fries, sweet potato fries, rice, chicken nuggets (for your non-seafood loving friends that tag along), crawfish and other fixings. . . In my opinion, this location by Decatur, is better than the one off of Valley View or off Eastern.. . If you've never been here before, be prepared to use your hands and get messy. My "system" is to lay a couple sheets of paper towels underneath the bag of shrimp to absorb any stray sauce drippings so it doesn't drip off the table and into my lap. I also have my orange soda with a straw within drinking distance so I don't have to grab the styrofoam cup and get sauce all over it. After I put my plastic bib on, I put lemon juice on my fingers and wipe them off, then put the gloves on. After I'm done eating, I put more lemon juice on my fingers to help remove the smell of skrrrimps and seasoning and then wash my hands. . . Anyway, the food is really good. Everything is tasty. Service is always pretty decent. Whenever I need my fix, I come here!
defiantly try the shrimp with the Hot N Juicy special sauce and with any spice level you can handle. just give me a pound of shrimp and beer and I'll be happy :)
I love this place been here twice now and the shrimp and crawfish are amazing if you don't mind getting your hands dirty and love sea food check this place out.
Growing up some of my good friends were Louisiana Creole, and every so often they'd fly in crawfish from Louisiana and cook it right there in their backyard. So I've been wanting to check out Hot N Juicy since I moved to Vegas, but I tend to think of it as a communal eating experience that requires at least a small group. I finally had my chance last weekend when my aunt and cousin came into town with their friends. . . For 5 people (four women, one man) we ordered 3 lbs of crawfish, 4 lbs of shrimp, a dozen sausages, and one corn and potato for each person, all cooked in the Hot N Juicy house seasonings (as recommended by the waitress when we couldn't decide). The first time you go to a restaurant like this it is hard to know what spice level to choose. We had a mixed group so we played it safe by getting everything mild and asking for a medium sauce on the side. I can handle spicy pretty well, and I think the mild was perfect if you just want to enjoy the flavor of the food with a small amount of kick for the authentic Cajun taste. Granted, the shrimp hold the spice much better than the crawfish (since you get such a small amount of meat out of crawfish). I think that if I came here with just my husband, we'd probably opt for medium level spice since he puts hot sauce or salsa on everything!!. . Know before you go: There are no plates. You are served all your food in plastic bags (to hold in the juices) right on your table which is covered with paper and supplied with plastic gloves and a roll of napkins. You are also given a bib to wear, and you'll need it!!! It is a messy and time consuming meal (for the infrequent crawfish eater) but once you get over getting "down and dirty" at dinner, it is well worth it!!
Normally people rave about Hot N Juicy. It's just okay for me. I've been at different times of the day. I have gone at 10:30 and stayed until midnight. The last time I went was in the middle of the afternoon at around 1:30. The service was really good. Granted, there were only 3 or 4 tables, but they were still really attentive. I arrived first and waited for my friend. They seated me immediately me and brought me water and my bib. I did have to wait for my friend for a bit as she ran on Filipino time. The servers kept checking on me to ask me if I was ready to order.  . . We both ordered a half pound of shrimp. It is very nice that with shrimp, we can order half a pound. My friend ordered the lemon pepper medium spicy. I ordered hot n juicy medium spicy as well. I love the taste of mine. Whenever I order shrimp, I always get lemons, limes, salt and pepper and dip my shrimp in it. . . This is very very messy, so I would never order shrimp to go because it's a mess. . . I think part of the reason is that I get so grossed out because the shrimp isn't peeled and deveinned, so you still that gross line that you can see while you eat.Next time, I might just devein all my shrimp after peeling it.  Something else that bothers me about the shrimp is that the flavor is all encased on the outside. The actual shrimp has no flavor. After I peel the shrimp, I still have to drench it in sauce. . . The service is very superior here, though!
I'm used to The Boiling Crab in Los Angeles and was looking for a replacement here in Vegas...This place is a pretty decent alternative. We had the crawfish and shrimp with the Hot N Juicy Seasoning with medium spice level. The medium was a little mild for me and would recommend going for spicy if you want more kick. The crawfish was super fresh while shrimp wasn't as fresh but still tasted good. Compared to Boiling Crab, the seasoning had less garlic which is good or bad depending on what you like. The service was good, wait was not as long as BC, and they even give you the choice to use gloves in case you don't want your hands to stink for a week.
I have to say that I am quite impressed! I thought that Hot N Juicy was just another Boiling Crab knock off but in a sense it is actually better than it's competition.. . The shrimp are of better quality and size and the sauces aren't too garlic filled. I actually left the restaurant without my my fingertips smelling like garlic for 2 days. (You know what I'm talking about. Haha). . . The service was amazing! We had two servers that were helping my party of. 6 and they were friendly, attentive and very fun. They made the experience even a better one. . . The ambiance is even better than being at boiling crab! It still is fun but more warm (welcoming) and not as loud so you can actually hear what people at your table are saying.
I have been wanting to try this place for years after hearing such great reviews about this place! I visited Vegas with my girlfriends one weekend and was adamant about coming to this restaurant. We started our lunch off with a basket of garlic cajun fries to share. The fries tasted mediocre and I don't recall tasting any "cajun" flavoring. I also ordered a pound of garlic shrimp at mild with added corn and sausage. The bag came out piping hot when our server brought it out to us.  The sauce was mediocre; nothing spectacular that made me wanting to come back for more. My corn tasted 2 days old which of course I told our server! She was at least nice enough to remove it off our bill. :) . . After having such high expectations for this place, I realized this restaurant is totally overrated! I still prefer my Boiling Crab over this place any day!!
I eat here all the time, or whenever I can afford it =( I like all the expensive stuff.. you know, snow crab legs, king crab legs... and you cant just order 1lb! I hate hate hate that theres always a wait when I go there, but this last time we only waited about 15 minutes. Usually we wait 30- 45 min. I went there with my sister and her family and a friend. I prefer the flavors of Hot n Juicy over Boiling Crab... in Vegas anyway. Boiling Crab in Texas and Cali is another story though. I usually order the Hot n Juicy special, medium heat. Crab legs are sooo good. Oysters were yummy. The crawfish.... sucked. They were super tiny and just plain sucked. Im pretty sure they were frozen and not fresh. I know my crawfish. We ordered 2lbs for the whole table... and nobody finished it. We just ate all the crab legs. The clams were good too. My sister devoured them. My friend ordered the chicken wings and fries. She said they were were good.. it would be hard to mess up chicken wings and fries though. Service is.. whatever. They get to you when they can, usually you have to flag them down. Lets just say we all go there for the food. Not service. But the service isnt horrible either... theyre just not very attentive. So... clams, snow crab legs, king crab legs, oysters, chicken wings, fries, shrimp... allll good. The crawfish?? Hit or miss.
