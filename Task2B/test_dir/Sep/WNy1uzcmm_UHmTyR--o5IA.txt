I went here with a friend for dinner the other day. She recommended that I try it. I was impressed! The food was delicious (I ordered the Shepherds Pie with Lamb)! The portions are huge.. I was able to save half of the pie for the next days lunch. . . I hope I can go back there and try the other delicious pies they serve. . . Tip: The Tempe location is a little hidden, but its worth it when you find it. I love how they have outdoor seating on pick-nick tables.
This place is awesome, kind of dark and subdued but totally works, once inside the staff is super helpful and friendly. If you like beer, well they have 20+ handles on tap. The food? The food you ask? AWESOME Cornish Patsy's of every flavor and type! Pork, chicken, beef, veggie, Mexican, Italian on and on and on.... Oh I'm not done, desert Patsy's !!! So FREAKING GOOD! You have to try this place! Great history of how Patsy's came to be, mining theme on the walls. Try it you'll love it!
Great food and atmosphere! Love the cider! They also have an entire page dedicated to vegetarian menu items!
Wow! My son I and went here on a whim and I am so glad we did.  The meat and cheese pasty is tasty and filling.  We are a condiment family but there is no need for help on these babies.  Although the gravy and dripping sauce were superb, we hardly touched them.. . The restaurant is dark and unimpressive but don't let that deter you.   Our server was super nice and responsive.  The order took a few extra minutes but it came out piping hot and fresh.. . The entire experience made us want to visit the UK.
The Good: Tasty pasties, creative flavors, and a casual vibe.. . The Bad: Hipster prices. $9+ for a single pasty, no matter how filling, is slightly overpriced. Also, there was still leftover food crusted on one of our plates. And while I'm riding this gripe train, what's the point of bolting down your benches so damn close to the table?. . Overall: The quality is there; the ambiance is appealing. Not really a huge "wow" experience for me, but a solid food choice nonetheless (for Arizona).
This is probably my favorite place in Tempe. I would eat a pasty from this place every day, no joke. They have a wide variety of pasties from more traditional ones like Shepherds Pie or Bangers & Mash (my two favorites besides the Cajun Chicken) to The Mexican or Chicken Alfredo. I usually get a pasty, some oven chips, and a Strongbow (which they almost always have on tap). Thishas been a favorite place for my group of friends to meet and catch up at for years now. I've never once had a bad experience at this place. Plus, great music! (;
The bartenders were all on one side of the bar. It took over 15 minute's to get a drink. When a bartender did tell me that he would be with me in a second, it took a couple more minutes for the different bartender to take and fill my order. Won't be going back.
Food is good and they have a great beer selection. Every waiter/waitress is in skinny jeans and a vintage T-shirt showcasing how original they are. If you can get past that and the below average service it is a good place to get a bite and a pint. Also the seating inside is mostly wicked uncomfortable so have an extra pint.
All my life I thought the Irish were responsible for rainbows. Fantasies of red-bearded drunks dancing in shamrock fields with pots of gold had always accompanied the notorious rainbow in my childhood imagination. Then, I assumed the gays stole it. I was wrong. The Cornish own the rainbow. Let me explain:.  . I became stranded in the Arizona desert when my Pinto got not one, but four flat tires. (Hit a hot speed bump and the tires melted right off.) I realized that I didn't have any food or water. At that moment, I knew I'd be fighting for my life.. . My heart began to race. I was on the verge of having a panic attack. I had to settle myself down. I took a few deep breaths and knew what I needed--smooth jazz. I turned the radio to 95.5 KYOT (The Valley's original smooth jazz station). I couldn't believe my ears. Coolio's "Gangsta's Paradise" was blaring through my speakers. Projectile vomit shot out my mouth. Had my entire childhood been sold down the dry canal? I thought God was playing a sick trick on me. I shuffled through radio stations faster than old people shuffle board (i.e. I took my time). But, it was true. Thee "Coyote" sold out.. . All hope had been lost. My spirit was shattered, and the little moisture I had left was now a soggy puddle in the passenger's seat. I was in a dire situation. In desperation, I checked between the seat cushions hoping to find some crumbs to eat but, instead, found a few petrified McDonald french fries. I looked at them and thought to myself: "I'd rather eat pigeon crap." I flicked the fries out of my Pinto. I used my finger to write a goodbye message on the dirt-crusted windshield and began my trek across the arid valley. . . As far as I could see, nothing but cacti and cheap Mexican food restaurants. The little vegetation was riddled with thorns and bore no fruit. The thought of a carne asada burrito tempted me like a mirage, but I knew the explosive diarrhea I'd get would dry me out quicker than a sponge in the sun. I had to stay strong and keep going. . . After four long minutes of walking, I gave up. The sun leached my energy and exhausted all remaining calories. The horizon held no signs of hope. Just signs for Filiberto's, Amado's, Los Favorito's, Armando's, Pedrito's, and Taco Bell. My pasty skin was turning pink and my balls looked like raisins, so I sat in the shade of a palo verde tree and prayed. I begged God not to let me die. I repented for my sins. I promised that if he let me live I'd never do anything bad ever again. . . Then, out of the blue, I felt drops of wetness on my bald scalp. I looked up to the sky and saw that a pigeon was dropping deuces from the branch above. (I guess He wasn't too fond of me flicking french fries onto the desert ground.) God trickled the sign I was begging for right on my forehead, and now He was putting me to the test. If I wanted to be saved, I'd have to eat pigeon deux. So, I bowed my head, placed my palms together, and said grace. . . There was a trembling rumble that echoed across the desert, and it wasn't the sound of me regurgitating. As I stood up from the gravel to peer into the abyss of newly formed clouds, a surge of water swept my legs out from under me. Before I knew it, I was being carried away in a flash flood. . . My next memory was waking to the sound of chirping birds. I flinched and covered my face fearing that I may be lying under another pigeon-riddled palo verde. I opened my eyes and was blinded by colors. I didn't know what was going on. Vibrant reds, yellows, and blues! I had no idea where I was. I got so scared, I pooped a Skittle. Then, it hit me. You know when people say that it's impossible to reach the end of the rainbow? It's a lie. It's at the entrance of a mystical place called Cornish Pasty. . . I entered the land of the Cornish and it was like no place I'd ever been. I expected leprechauns but encountered a species far more enchanting, with skins of the finest tapestries and earlobes so large and peculiar that they could double as tire swings. Apparently, I wasn't the first person to reach the End of the Rainbow, because this place was packed tighter than a carton of cigarettes. I tracked down one of these Cornish creatures and told her my story, explaining how famished I was. She was unusually polite and let me sit in her earlobe until a seat opened up at a table. I swung around the restaurant as she went from table to table, filling mugs up with magically frothy beer. Then, I whispered in her ear: "Are there pots of gold here?" A spot at a table had opened up, and she sat me down. She told me that she'd be right back. . . I sketched pictures of these Cornish creatures as I waited. The troll returned and placed a dish in front of me. She gave me a wink, then walked away. I grabbed the warm pocket of food that rested on the metal dish before me, stuffed it in my mouth, and died.. . It was gold, my friends.
If you've had real British food, then you'd probably think this place is on par with your previous experiences.  . . I think the concept is cool.. . The food is OK but somewhat uninspiring...but then again this is British food (not a knock, just the truth).  I tried the Turkey pasty and Salmon pasty.  As for taste, I definitely give the edge to the salmon.  . . For dessert, I tried the Strawberry Palova.  It was good, but very rich so I could only a eat half of it.. . The best thing about this place is that its very affordable for those who eat on a budget.  We had two pasties, dessert, 3 glasses of wine and a Sprite for less than $50.. . If you've never been, I definitely recommend checking out this place.
It's pretty much an over-priced hot pocket. I didn't like it.  I got  the; . . Spicy Asiago Chicken $9.00. Spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes. With a side of sour cream & salsa.. . It tasted a little like a Mexican / Italian hot pocket because of the "stewed tomatoes". . . My husband got the:. . Peppered Steak $9.80. Sirloin steak, sauteed portabella mushrooms, leeks, roasted zucchini, and Stilton cheese (Imported English bleu cheese). With a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce.. . Good quality meat but again, tasted almost like a hot pocket.
Best food in town. If you're all about being a part of 'the scene' - this is the place for you. They seem to only hire aspiring models and bearded biker types, but I heard this is cool now-a-days. Food can be pricey and heavily buttered, but it tastes great and is made right in front of you so you can see no one is messing with your food in the back. Go to the Mesa location to avoid 'sceney' type people. They keep the place dimly lit and there is a smokers patio. Don't be surprised if someone there offers you drugs. This is a notorious spot for cocaine transactions, hence the 'sceney' aspect. I don't judge, but if this business started drug testing it's employees, it would not have a staff, so don't fix what's not broken. Keep on truckin'
I absolutely love this place.  The staff is super friendly and the food is excellent.  I love the vegan options too!  The only problem is when they run out of the pasty I wanted to try but that's really nothing to complain about just means I need to get there earlier next time.  I always like to get a pb&j to take home for dessert later too.  The portions are huge so I usually can't finish my meal but pastys make for good left overs.  My favorite is the chicken marina.
One of my favorite restaurants on earth!  Any time I'm in Phoenix I never miss an opportunity to come here. Awesome beer selection, and the food is out of this world!
Having only been here are few times I can tell you that when I find myself in Tempe this is the first place that pops into mind when someone asks, "Where do you want to go eat?" . With as many reviews as this place, it appears to cover various aspects.  What I will further drive in is the fact that this is quality scratch food.  Be patient this is not some Hot Pocket fresh out of the microwave. It is real food.  . Pasties are not the only thing on the menu.  They have a great selection of salads and soups.  Vegan, veg whatever...they got you covered....
Ah, The Cornish Pasty. The food is so good, I would eat there even if I was treated like a total slob and the employees were all jerks. But the service is also really good. And great beers.
