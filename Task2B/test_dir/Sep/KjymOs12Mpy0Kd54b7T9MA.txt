3.5 stars for food, 4 stars if the fountains were on when I came. . . FOOD. Complimentary bread and dip (4 stars): The bread variety was great. The spreads are all olive spreads, really good if you're an olive fan, if not, you're out of luck. . . Margarita Chicken Sandwich (3.5 stars): Juicy chicken, not amazing flavors but pretty good. Needed more basil. . . Spicy Chicken Flat bread (3.5 stars): Needed more flavor too, but still good. Not as crunchy on the bottom of the pizza, but the crust was crunchy. . . Cookie Sandwich Sundae (3.5 stars): Actually pretty small compared to the picture they show you! But good when it's so hot out outside! We asked to do both vanilla ice cream sandwiches and they did it. Good ice cream, good cookie. . . Complimentary Cream Puffs for special occasions: So nice they gave something for a special occasion. Who ever they have writing in chocolate is so talented, looked perfect. . . VIEW (4 stars):. With the fountains on it would definitely be a 5 star experience! We came on a weekday at 12:30PM for lunch and got a seat outside. I was waiting for the fountains until the waitress told me they don't turn on till 3PM on weekdays. WHATTTT, why am I here? Well it was still pretty to sit outside near the water and see the view of the strip, but the reason I came here was for those damn fountains, a little disappointing. So come after 3PM on weekdays! . . SERVICE (4 stars):. At first when they took us outside on the patio for seating they had 2 tables open, one with partial shade, the other in the over 100 degree heat. They need to fix the umbrellas to cover all the tables more, how can you eat in that heat! We ended up scrunching into the partial shaded table. But everyone was nice. Our waters were always filled, the waitress was a little chatty with certain tables so you had to wait till she was done to ask for stuff, but other than that everything was good.
While waiting for our room at Paris we went to one of our favorites, Olives. Kimberly was an outstanding server. We had a nice glass of sparkling Lamberti rose which went well with our favorite, the beef carpaccio, almost a meal it's so large. The beef is laid over a mound of polenta. We also had the fig and prosciutto flat bread. The crust was perfect.  Olives style fits nicely in Bellagio.
My boyfriend and I waited for a patio seat, so worth it. . . He liked his sea bass but I don't think he would getit again. I had the butternut squash pasta, very good but very very rich, I could not finish all of it.. . Service was good, view of the fountains at night was excellent!!!. . I would go back :)
I really like Olives -- the food is good, the wine list is well-thought, and the atmosphere is excellent.  Getting a seat on the balcony that overlooks the Bellagio fountains is a truly wonderful experience, especially at night, though the inside of the restaurant is fine too (a steakhouse feel due to the dimmer lighting).. . Have had really standout service here -- the waiters, managers, and sommelier will take good care of you.  A final word on the atmosphere; the last two times I have gone, I have seen a proposal on the balcony (outdoor seating area), so it really is quite special.  I do feel that this is priced into the menu, so if you are not at all interested in watching the fountains or dining at the Bellagio, you could easily get as good a meal elsewhere on the strip at significantly lower cost.. . The reservations line you get through Google or Bellagio.com connects to the hotel's central reservations line, and they don't have a very good sense of how booked the restaurant is.  By asking the central reservations agent to connect you directly to the host ("can you transfer me to the restaurant?"), you will often be able to get a table even if the reservations agent tells you that the restaurant is fully booked.
This review is for Saturday night on Labor Day weekend, 2014. . . Our server Paul (if I remember correctly) was funny and attentive. We arrived at 6PM witha 645 reservation. When we arrived at 6, the lady said there was a wedding rehearsal dinner in the patio until 8 but would willingly give us a table out there if they finished early. Luckily their rehearsal ended around 7pm and we were given a table outside for 6. The reservation was for my parents 30th anniversary and we really wanted the patio table. I previously read how hard it was to get one so in the end it was so worth it because the view and ambiance was just outstanding. . . We ordered the beef carpaccio and smoked salmon flatbread for appetizers and the beef carpaccio was AMAZING.. I had the mushroom pappardelle and it was a little on the heavy side but aside from that--it tasted on the good average side. My dad had the mushroom risotto added on to his steak. Let me tell you--I love risotto! The texture was good, tasted cheesy and made pretty well. The lamb lollipop was amazing. Tender, soft and tasty. It was made RIGHT. We also ordered the Chilean sea bass and my brother in law had no complaints. Said it was good. In the end of our dinner, our server brought out a couple of mini choux with "happy anniversary" written in beautiful hand writing. My parents loved the dinner and enjoyed the show. Took many breathtaking pictures with the fountain show. But I got to say--if it wasn't for the patio seating granting us a good view of the fountain show, I would probably not return since the taste was a little above average but not good enough to be this overpriced.. . I enjoyed dinner at Olives and would definitely come back again (for the view) BUT, i do have some cons:. . 1) When I called to make a reservation, the lady on the phone was pretty rude rushing me off the phone just because I asked if they do floral arrangement for dinner and asked her for patio seating &she said "let me tell you..when you get here you ask for patio. If you want flowers ask concierge." She was trying to be nice for the sake of her job but I can tell from her tone of voice that she wanted me off the phone ASAP.. . 2) Patio seating should be reservable. It would take a lot less effort for customers so customers would not have to worry if they would be able to get a patio seat for special occasions.
This was my 4 th trip to Olives, over 4 years. This visit was a disappointment, esp as I had a guest from Palm Springs. Service was attentive but sloppy. Ice cubes left melting  on the table as server was careless. LOUD African tribal music made conversation difficult, in this lovely venue.  Menu odd.  Not all choices should be 'fusion'. We had eaten at Mon Amie Gabi previous pm, with much better food.  Would have stayed longer at Olives and enjoyed the $27/ glass wine, but the music was unbearable.
This is still our favorite dining experience in Vegas. Food choices are impeccable. They starter hors d'ouvres of olive tapenade and breads sets the tone. Would always recommend the beef tenderloin. Chocolate cake for dessert is a must especially if you are with date. If looking for pasta, mix it up a little and go with gnocchi.
This is a great spot for lunch. Recently, while on a business trip, I snuck in for a quick little lunch at the bar. On a 100+ degree Las Vegas summer day, the watermelon, heirloom tomato, and feta salad paired perfectly with a crisp Sauvignon Blanc that the bartender suggested. I will definitely be back to try a flatbread!
It isn't a trip to Vegas for me without dinner at Todd English's Olives   Our meal was excellent as always.   A draw back is the restaurant is noisy so if you are looking for a quiet dinner for two, this will not be the place.   If you are looking for a fastastic meal you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu
This was the best restaurant of our entire post-Labor Day stay!  Try the Expresso Martini - well worth the money.
Consistent, great service and a wonderful view. It is truly one of my Vegas favorites. Tuna tartare is excellent as is the scallops! Big fan of Todd English whom I met and thought what a gentlemen... I make a point to stop in and always impressed with how much pride the staff has working there. Just absolutely love it! Just make your reservations because it gets packed!
To be fair, I did not get a chance to try the good at Olives, even though I was looking forward to it. . . When I went, I decided to wait at the bar for a friend to meet me. The first hostess rolled her eyes at me and responded with, "Fine, if you can find a seat." I was able to take a seat at the bar. The bartender was friendly and the cocktail was excellent. . . A few minutes later my friend arrived. I got up from the bar to meet her and realized that both of the hostesses were being extremely rude. They informed her that since I had decided to wait at the bar, they could no longer give us a table. They also said that she could not sit at the bar because it was completely full. Both hostesses seemed incredibly put out and when I tried to speak to the about the situation, they turned away and hold me, "You should have taken your table when you got here." I had only been at the bar for 5-10 minutes, and there were several open tables.. . My friend and I decided that there were several other places at The Bellagio where we knew the food was excellent, and the staff were MUCH friendlier. . . It was disappointing.
One of the best scallop meals of my life here. Per a recommendation from the server, who said it was the best thing on the menu. . . Our table of 10 had no problem getting all food and drinks out in a timely manner. Every table gets olives and different breads that are each flavorful and delicious. . . Even from our table near the front of the restaurant, you could see the fountains outside. Enjoy!
First off - if you can get a table outside, PLEASE do.. . We had Paul as a server and he was the absolute best.  We ended up having a late reservation here since we wanted a table outside to see the Bellagio Fountain show.  When we got seated, we were at a table that could see the show but we were more towards the back. We got a bottle of wine and ordered the beef carpaccio to start with.   This is quite a hefty appetizer and PERFECT if it's a warm night outside since it's cold. By far some of the best I've had ever.. . We decided to skip the main course since we had an appetizer while waiting for our table to open up and went for the banana tiramisu. HIGHLY recommend. It was a wonderful mix of banana, cream, chocolate, dark chocolate and it was perfect. . . Before we ordered dessert, a table had opened up in the front row of the patio absolutely PERFECT to see the show and Paul moved us closer without even hesitating.  His great service and thoughtfulness made our night along with the ambiance and good food.. . Overall- Olives was a good choice for us.  It's a little pricey but hey, that's Vegas :)
Always great food! For lunch I had the steak sandwich with thinly sliced onion rings. My wife had scallops with risotto.  Each dish was amazing and full of flavor.  Our service was adequate and timely. I enjoy dining here for special occasions.
I met a friend here for lunch on Monday and had a nice experience.  Much of the menu is quite heavy for lunch, but we ended up deciding to split the salmon entree and the truffle fries to control our portions.  The truffle fries were perfect...not overwhelming or too rich in flavor.  The salmon was great too with a cognac beurre blanc sauce served with asparagus and wild rice.  The restaurant is nicely designed with beautiful views of Lake Bellagio and the fountain show and the service is top notch too!
They have delicious vegan gluten free options! Incredibly accommodative. Thank you for a great food experience
We had a 6:45 reservation but asked to be seated on the patio.  As we expected, there was an additional wait.  Seating time was 9:15 - wasn't expecting quite that long but okay, we waited and, for the view, it was worth it.  Unfortunately, after all that time we were given a table well away from the rail and didn't get the best view of the fountains.  . . We were happy that the view was special because the food was nothing more than average (expensive and average).  Because we had waited so long we had stopped for drinks and an appetizer earlier in the evening so we were not interested in a huge meal.  Good thing because the roasted chicken my husband ordered was a very small serving.  The sauce was delicious but that was the only stand out.  I ordered gnocchi.  Our meal was actually delayed because the kitchen felt that the first order was not right.  The order they served me was very unevenly heated.  I have a feeling I had some of the first order plus some additional new pasta.  The sauce was pretty heavy but the gnocchi were fine.  The menu mentions pulled chicken but there was very little of that on the plate.  . . There were several large groups on the patio that stayed for an extended time and were VERY loud - guess that's what you expect for late on a Saturday night. . . Warning- a photographer will come around to take pictures, which we decided to purchase.  We paid in cash and she shorted us $5 on the change.  We didn't notice right away and were too tired to go back and ask about it.  They were overpriced to start with so......
I. Love. This. Restaurant. We go every time we are in Vegas. The food is fabulous, the service is stellar! We always sit on the patio so we can watch the Bellagio fountains while we enjoy our meal. It doesn't get any better than this. Order the beef carpaccio, you will not be sorry! Make reservations or you may not get in (the hostesses here can get a bit snotty about it).
