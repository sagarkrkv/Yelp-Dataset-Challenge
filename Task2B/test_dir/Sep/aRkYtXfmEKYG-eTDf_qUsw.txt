I really love the environment at Lux - it's a great place to study or catch up with a friend.  I got the blueberry scone and the hibiscus iced tea and both were great.  The scone was moist and delicious.  I also had some of my friend's coffee and donuts (Chocolate and Lemon) which were delicious as well.  Overall, it's a great place and if I lived in the area I'd definitely be a frequent customer!
Lux lives up to its hipster hype.  Go here for the hip, bohemian feel you crave from Soho, Central Phoenix, or similar places.  . . I prefer getting my things to go because this place is always crowded and parking is a nightmare.  This is why I dock them 1star.  However, Lux is conveniently located just off the lite rail.. . I am not sure how many times I have stopped in Lux over the past few weeks for a cup of coffee and a breakfast sandwich.  This Friday was the first time I noticed the bottle of Tito's and next to it a bottle of Hendrick's.....  This place has a bar?  Oh, gosh, they do!  Well damn!  Oh, I never envisioned myself as a hipster hanging out there eating at the the huge tables with my laptop on their free wifi or in one of the comfy chairs reading a book, but I see a book, comfy chair and cocktail in my future!  Stumble home....  Repeat.  Lol... Stumble home from the coffee shop.  Funny.  I highly recommend this place.  . . Return factor 100%.
I love LUX's everything! It's a great place to enjoy a cup of coffee, study, or simply just hang out with friends for a chat. Their music and atmosphere is very hip (which I love). I go at least once a week for my fix. I love it here!
I've been going to Lux since 2012 and every barista who has ever helped me out has been an asshole. The only thing that keeps me coming back is their mac and cheese and the fact that there's always really ridiculously good-looking people there.
No no NO NO! I've been here enough times over the past couple of years to refute the hype, players! Yes this place is tragically hip and over-crowded like a b. But so whats?. . Coffee and tea: good, like most specialty places that serve it (Cartel, Echo, Urban Beans, JoBot, etc etc etc). But let's talk about the REALITIES of a trip to (not)Lux.. . There are many parking spaces that are usually taken. My guess is more than 70% of thecrowd here are students who spend all day working over a cup of coffee and maybe a sssscccccooooonnnneeee. The "Order Here" counter is placed right along the entrance, so when lines back up, they are backing up into a seating area. God help you if that mommy with her two toddlers are seated at an entrance-area table. Good luck getting past that, boss.. . The employees here are beyond obnoxious. Gave 'em multiple chances to be cool. They ain't. The baked goods are all pretty much blah/dry/not good. On our first visit to (not)Lux, we sampled much of the pastry menu to-go, because we had heard good things. But much like Cartel, Lux is all hype and not comfort, goodness or fun. It's pain. Pain to find parking. Pain to wait in the interminable line. Pain to deal with the 24-year-old baristas and register jockeys. Pain to find a place to sit. AAARRRGGGHHH!!!. . If you're young and down to study and stare, this place is for you. If you aren't 18-25 and wearing flannel, jean shorts, Converse All-Stars, hipster glasses (prescription or otherwise), really wanna live in Portland, have iPod earbuds soldered into your head.............move along, because there's nothing to see here.
I luv lux!!!!!. . +. The coffeeeeee. The chai. The scrambled eggs. The hash. The lemon water jug. The furniture. The music. The croissants. . -. Sometimes hard to find seating. Need more salt shakers (lol but I am serious)
Great place! Hang out there all the time! Great coffee and food. I really can't sell it in words, you just have to try it!
I love the soups at Lux. Different every day & served with the most yummie bread. However, the last few times I have been here including today, the soup is completely blended. Didn't see a soup spoon & I feel like a baby feeding myself liquid food. If it was on the menu that this was yet another texture- less soup, I would have ordered something else. I usually look forward to coming here & when the food is disappointing... It's an extra bummer. . . Please Lux! At least let us know on the menu that soup is completely blended. Ugh
Its a coffee place.. Its a bar.. Its a date place.. Its a study lounge.. . LOVE. LOVE LOVE LOVE.. . If you are a coffee drinker this place is for you. if you aren't about that.. it may be hard to navigate because they don't really have a menu. its more like you tell them they can make it. They are real Baristas. No posers here.. real hipsters!
On our way out of Phoenix and made a special trip to Lux- I totally appreciate the killer finds on Yelp. As a frequent traveler I have found some of the best, hard to find, off the grid bizarre located food spots. Lux definitely is one of them and is high on the return list for:. . *Amazing baked goods. *Hysterical cute man running the register. *Fab gal taking barista orders and facilitating the crazy line. Her customer service was spot on.. . It's a bummer (yes my use of antiquated terms shows my age) that Lux has some frequent patrons that seem slightly spoiled, rude and frankly full of themselves -. . Future Lux patrons ignore the whining narcissistic reviews, clearly these people have no perspective on what is important in our world today - LUX is damn good coffee and incredible food-. . Wish Lux had another location closer to us in San Diego but then again no, it would ruin the uniqueness!
Great stop in central Phoenix for some great coffee.. I've been coming to Lux for a while now and have been pleasantly surprised with great coffee, food and customer service.. . If you haven't been to Lux yet, please do so. Hidden away, it brings Phoenix phenomenal coffee. For breakfast, I recommend getting the quiche or the egg bake. When fall comes around make sure to get yourself a pumpkin whoopie pie (you'll thank me later). . . Every time I have been it has been packed- yet all the staff are friendly and very accommodating. But the biggest reason I decided to write this review was not even based on the iced-coffee or the yummy pastries.. . Yesterday, after leaving Lux I realized I had lost my set of keys. I decided to call Lux to see if I had left them behind. Elena answered the phone and I told her my situation. Not only was she kind, she also went around Lux while on the phone with me to search for my keys. She even went to the parking lot and tried to find them there. I was pleasantly surprised with her thoughtfulness to search for my keys for me. Though she wasn't able to find them while I was on the phone with her-she assured me that she would call me back if anything came up. She also proceeded to tell me to have a good day and good luck finding my keys.  So thank you Elena, for restoring my faith in humanity and for being such a kind individual. Make sure you all leave a tip for my girl Elena!
Great coffee! Just a little hard to find but glad we did. Doesn't look like anything from the street but is all going on inside. A little more streetside advertising would certainly help us out-of-towners find the place. Obviously the locals have no trouble!
When I moved to Phoenix, this was by far the number one and most recommended coffee shop to try out. I love to try new things but this is one place that I have only ever had one beverage and love it. The espresso is delicious and I stick with my iced almond milk lattes.. . There is plenty of great seating but parking can be pretty difficult to find.
Really wonderful space.  I love the myriad options...I'll have a brewed, tropical flavored ice tea, no wait, I'll have a glass of pinot noir, no wait I'll have a chai latte with soy milk...um, wait, how's the lemonade? This was me at the counter trying to order (ok, not really- but it's what was going on in my head).  Lux is the perfect place to get some work done while still interacting with the 3 dimensional people.  When I'm reading some clinical texts and I'm afraid I'm going to slip into a coma, I go to Lux.  Somehow reading boring things in the presence of fascinating people is substantially more doable.
Awesome place for a number of activities. Food, coffee, drinks, great  experiences. Drinks are creative, unique, and well crafted. Good place to do some schooling as well. Can't wait to go back. Perfect for rich conversation with a beautiful Lady.
Dope ass coffee shop/bar/cafe.  The only thing it's missing is an abundance of power strips.  The macchiato I had seemed a tad small for the advertised two shots of espresso though.  Maybe they just forgot the second shot?  In any case I was too intimidated by the barista's hipness to say anything.
Lux is appropriate: Daytime, nighttime, by yourself, with a friend, with a group, on a date, studying, working, people watching, zoning out looking at your caffeine, or alcoholic beverage, of choice (they have Henderick's gin btw).. . I always get a London fog (earl grey latte with vanilla) and get brunch.  It's busy and loud, but they get through the line quickly and the food and baked goods make for a perfect morning.  There are multiple rooms, benches, couches, cute  !@# chairs, tables for groups, outside seating... you have options! I've enjoyed this place with friends for years and I hope it always remains a happy little part of Phoenix.
