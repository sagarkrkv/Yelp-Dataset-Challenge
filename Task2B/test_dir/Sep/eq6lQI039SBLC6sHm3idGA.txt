What is up with the hype? Is it because everyone coming here is super buzzed and everything taste good? LOL don't get me wrong, the pizza was good but it wasn't what I expected and left me unsatisfied. I didn't get the "HOT DAYAM! THIS ISH IS THE BOMB!!!" It was a "EH, it's ok? Not sure what the hype was all about?". . Just in case your looking for it, it's on the 3rd floor. Then between the old elevator and a restaurant is this long hallway which leads you to the Secret Pizza. The customer service was ok but I didn't expect anything super spectacular because it's a pizza joint. . . I got the white pizza with ricotta cheese. The hubby got the salami with jalapeno.. . You can't go wrong with white pizza it was ok. They actually were both ok.. . Would I come again, maybe? Only if I have friends in town.
Good, greasy pizza to absorb some booze from your system.
The hubby and I both love this place. We've taken many friends and family here when they've come from out of town and everyone loves it. The pizza is great but i think they also dig the novelty of it being a "secret" place.. . The white pizza is my favorite (is that what it's called?). My only complaint and the reason for not giving it 5 stars is because it doesn't taste too good cold or reheated the next day. I mean, who doesn't love cold pizza for breakfast?!? With this pizza its hot out if the oven or not at all for me.
First night back in Vegas and this was the spot to hit up! I didn't get to come here the past few times, so this time it was a must! . . We had the white pizza by the pie and it was absolutely DELICIOUS! It was a little more expensive than your conventional pizza but the taste was well worth it!
I have never worked so hard for a slice of pizza in my whole life!! Without a sign anywhere to be found, anyone could have simply just walked past this pizza goldmine! It was so hard to find that my group and I had to help direct a couple of customers in the right direction because they too were puzzled and lost as to where it was located! . . Food: During my visit here I got the sicilian pizza and I must say this may have just been the best pizza I have ever had! I am not exaggerating it was just that good! The crust was doughy yet crispy and they didn't cheap out on the toppings either! My slice in particular came with cheese, tomatoes and some deli meats on it! The portion is also huge so you definitely get your money's worth. . . Service: I came her after Marquee dayclub and there was already a pretty long line that formed when we arrived. This is why there is a one star deduction for the review. I think in total it took about 30 mins or more to get my one slice of pizza. I hope that they find a more efficient way to get people in and out faster in the future! . . Another con is the fact that there is no seating, if possible can you guys furnish the place with some tables and chairsso we can eat in peace! If you need a place to sit then go down the hallway, there you will find some comfortable one seaters! In the end, a majority of us had to just plop down on the floor because there were not enough chairs to go around.   . . . All in all, love the pizza but hate the slow service and lack of seating !
Loved this place!! I went two nights in a row after the club. Pizza is great but the only drag was the wait. And it's on the 3rd floor on the opposite site of the pool tables btw ;)
It's really a secret. It may be the best kept secret in the Cosmopolitan.  Find an unmarked hallway and take it. At the end are a couple if young, very friendly New Yorkers serving pizza by the slice for under $5. But the price is really inconsequential. The pizza is terrific--crust is chewy and crisp and the toppings are great. And the slices are huge!  . . This is such a fun delicious place to find among all the amazing upscale restaurants in the Cosmopolitan.
Labor Day Weekend. Driving into Vegas 1:30 am and general consensus was that we were all mother lovingly hungry! Way too late and way too lazy for nightclubs so this seemed like the best decision. Couple friends from Norcal haven't had the chance to try it and assured them we were definitely gettin' it in!!! . . Was late into the wee hours of the night but man the line was damn knarly! First time I went it was in the afternoon and there was definitely nothing like it was at that moment. Line was wayyyy out the hallway (which where the name Secret Pizza name empasizes) into the hotel walkway. Even with such a long line, wait didn't seem so terribly long... That always seems to be the case though when you're surrounded by good company and drunk people! . . There were six of us and at $5.25 per slice, we opted for buying a whole pie instead ($28). It was and extra 20-30 minute wait but price wise would say it's definitely worth it. We went with the White pie and you can't go wrong with a crowd favorite! Came out piping hot! But I'm sure it always does since it's always does since it's always so busy... Something about an entire pie dedicated to you that makes it taste THAT much better.. . That white sauce instead of a traditional red sauce was amazinggg. That light and airy ricotta cheese crumbling all in my maofz... So good. Slices were very large and we were still left with 2 extra slices which I had very little hesitation taking since the girls didn't want to eat much since day club the next day! (Score for the dudes! haha) . . We ended up coming back the next day and was just as good even though we were no where near as sober! Highlight goes too the awesome soundtrack going on that night! Singing Phil Collins rendition of " You Can't Hurry Love" with a hallway of strangers was the best feeling everrrrrrr! . . Great spot to make as part of the Vegas experience!... Or to get some really good pizza :)!
A must try! Pizza by the slice and they serve my favorite.... cannolis! . . As you come up the third floor escalators of the Cosmopolitan, this great pizza place is located just a lil to the left just down the hallway of vintage records... the pizza is always good and the workers are very efficient and friendly!. . I also love that the drinks are served in red solo cups!
Convenient late night pizza at the Cosmopolitan hotel. Indeed is a "secret" as it is not listed as one of the hotel's restaurants, and is hidden in the back of a sushi restaurant.. . Very basic pizza, tastes good if you're drunk with all that grease. Ate it again when I was sober and found myself not wow'd by the pizza. They don't have Hawaiian pizza. =[ Cousins & I ordered a whole pizza in advance, asking for pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers, and basil. They gave us a pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives??? We didn't want to wait any longer to get the right pizza, but come on... but yeah, bottom line, convenient if you're drunk in the middle of the strip and it's late and you want some decent pizza to help sober ya up.
I didn't even know there was a pizza place at the Cosmo (which is where I was staying at the time). It's a big "secret." Like Gretchen Wiener's hair.. . And when I say secret, I mean it. It's not listed anywhere on their directory. You just gotta believe... and you'll find it. On the 3rd floor. There's a long hallway with a bunch of pictures that lead to this unexpected treasure.. . There was a small line when me and my cousins went at around midnight, but looks can be deceiving. It took 10 minutes to reach the front, and 10 minutes is a long time when you're a wee bit tipsy. Come later than midnight, and you're going to have to wait.. . I decided to opt for a slice of their white pie. So cheesy and garlicky! It had a ton of cheese including ricotta. And each bite had a nice hint of garlic. Their pizza is definitely on the same level as something you'd find in New York.. . Prices are a bit on the higher side, but honestly, it's worth it. They also offer to bake off a whole pie for you if you're willing to wait 10-15 minutes.. . No, there's no place to sit, but there's places to stand and eat your pizza. It adds to the experience, I swear.. . I can't wait to grab another slice of their white pie when I'm back in town.
The Pizza here is sooooooo good especially after having some drinks in Vegas. Its a secret spot with no signs outside the location, you have to ask around to get to this spot. I know its on the 3rd floor. The white pizza is fantastic, my very favorite!!
The pizza here is good but nothing special really stands out about it other than the memories you and your drunk friends forget.
This is a must stop whenever I am in Vegas. It's cheap, fast, yummy. When I say fast... I mean all the hours they are open except between 12am-3am when all the club-goers are getting their hunger fixes. Attempting to grab a pizza during those hours mean ~2 hour wait. A. . You can grab a slice or a whole pizza. They have some ready to go ranging from pepperoni, cheese, combo, and white slice. Recently they even had a deep dish version of the white slice, looked awesome but a bit much forme. You could also add toppings to all he slices and they will stick it in the oven for you.  . . My go-to slice is simple: white slice with roasted tomatoes. The ricotta and white sauce combined with the tangy tomatoes is out of this world. The only thing I would recommend they change would be to add fresh chopped garlic to their menu.  I made the mistake of getting 3 whole pizzas with extra garlic, only to find they use powered garlic which left an awful aftertaste in my mouth.
Hands down best pizza place in Vegas. The location is sorta hard to find and it is not well advertised but it is the germ of the Cosmo. It on the the third floor, next to the pool table waiting area. Follow your nose and empty pizza boxes!. . They have been raising the price. The best way that we found out about doing this is just to order a whole pie. Call in and order.
Was more than I'd hoped.   It should have been simple enough to find but I got sidetracked on the 2nd floor thinking it was the third.  . . It's great Brooklyn style pizza honestly wish I'd had another slice by the time I got to where I was staying I was hoping they delivered but being a "secret" I assumed not.
if you're from NY, you'll know this pizza is average at best.. . I guess people from everywhere else don't have the same reference point.. . That being said, it's a solid late night option with good choices. it is a bit pricey
Found it!!! There's quite a wait so maybe not a secret anymore? Good but one of those Vegas decision, u just regret the next day.
I've heard so much about Secret Pizza over the last year or two...everyone either loves it or hates it, and there doesn't seem to be much in between.. . I'm right in the middle on my decision.... . I arrived at Secret Pizza about 10pm last night with my tequila boyfriend (my best friend, since my fella is not a tequila fan) and some Yelp friends...and some new friends we had made at the AWESOME margarita festival at the pool.  . . We were very intoxicated, and in need of pizza!. . The wait wasn't bad, especially since we got a whole pizza.  Service was pretty standard...not overly friendly, but not super happy to have a room full of drunk guests.  . . At my level of drunkenness, I think the pizza was the BEST pizza I've ever eaten.  Now, you also have to keep in mind that I've been dieting for 8 weeks, and have been craving pizza, too, so I'm sure that figured in a bit.. . It was hot...it was greasy, it was smothered in garlic...(well, that was our fault...didn't realize the "Parmesan cheese" we were putting on the pizza was actually garlic salt!)...it was good!. . Now, I'm going to have to try it again stone sober to see how I feel about it...you know how everything tastes good when you're intoxicated...I'd like to make sure that I don't need to drink 26 margaritas again to enjoy it.
Amazing new york style pizza restaurant.  I have no idea why they hide this in a alley between the sushi and mexican restauarent. . Great taste!
Super yummy! Just wish they had a bigger variety but the all white pizza hits the spot.
Pretty average pizza but it's a neat design and cheap eats for a LV hotel.  I had a meat and some type of unique cheese pizza which was popular and it was pretty good.  Water is around $6 a bottle , Slices are around $5.50. They also have an option of buying a 2 liter soda to share with friends which is neat.
Though it is not much of a secret anymore, Secret Pizza is a darling little gem and not to be missed when visiting Las Vegas. On the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel there is no sign for Secret Pizza, just a hallway lined with Italian-American singer's LP's that lead you to the pizza promise land.. . It is the best pizza in Las Vegas and there is no debate about that. Dollar for dollar this is the best meal in town.. . The space is small and there are only a few stools to sit at but this pizza was made for standing. They are constantly pulling out fresh pies to serve by the slice, or you can order your favorite toppings and they'll whip it up for you.. . I got the sausage and pepperoncini, which was right out of the oven and then had them throw some meatball on an existing pepperoni slice to reheat.. . They were both outstanding but the sausage won out because of its freshness and spiciness. I will be getting that combo again.. . When you come do what you will, just know that if you want to taste the true genius of this place get whatever is freshest out of the oven.. . My girl got the white Sicilian square, and because she loves me so much she allowed me to sample. Pretty fantastic.. . Dig in and don't let go!. . Secret Pizza you get the FlavorBoner trophy on this trip.. . I'll be wrapping my teeth around you soon, just not during nightclub hours as I have heard the line is way too insane.. . BTW..... . When at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, if it is a weekend or holiday, go to the Chandelier Lounge on the main floor. They have a band called MARK and The Martinis and they are excellent. The lead singer embodies all that is classic Las Vegas; he sings, he jokes, he interacts with the patrons. He does Sinatra, Dean and Sammy proud.
Your pizza is so good that the deodorant, Secret, had to tell everyone about it!!. . My cousin and I needed a night cap before we headed to our hotel. After a night/early morning of binge drinking, we needed some carbs to soak up some alcohol. The "Secret" location wasn't hard for me to find since I vowed to be back. The simplest way to get there is get on the third floor and look for a pool table. And boom! Right across from that is the small corridor to the "Secret" location!  . . I guess we caught a break from the line being very long. 3am and it was smooth sailing. My cousin place two slices of the combination. I wanted  to try the cheese one only, but at this point my stomach could handle one slice. The service was so quick that we were in and out.. . The crust was soft and crispy. The toppings of meats and veggies were covering the pizza slices. The cheese was stringy and gooey. A great sized piece to satisfy a drunken appetite.. . If this was "Fight Club", a lot of people would be in trouble. As everyone should know the first rule of  "Fight Club". You don't speak of "Fight Club"! But, oh well! Be prepared to be punched in the mouth with flavorful and filling pizza!
There is no real name for this place. It is hidden in the galley on the 3rd level of Cosmo. However their pizza is amazing. Since they are open till 4 at night it's perfect for late night after clubbing/drinking snack. I am a local but still drive all the way to Cosmo for their pizza. The only con is its expensive and the drinks the give are small in quantity and you cannot refill them.
Ok I am from New York and therefore I have to say that this pizza was above average.  I like that it is hard to find and you have to go through this narrow alley to get to it.  They have some arcade machines.  It is themed appropriately and kind of a small place but seriously stop by late night and grab a slice or two!!
deliciousness! so amazing, and great staff! coming back every weekend :)
I swear some times I dream of this pizza. the white cheese with meatballs will be the death of my diet all day everyday. I wish I could eat pizza for breakfast lunch and dinner. I want to bathe in it. Sorry, just can't get over this place. I'm actually gonna get off my lazy ass go buy some right now! I will see you in the black hole. Hope you are enjoying your time here in Vegas, where dreams come true and pizza taste amazing. Goodbye.
Standing here waiting for my white slice to cool is pure agony! This is truly the best pizza ever! The guys behind the counter, especially Ray, are amazing so don't forget the tip!
- Fantastic atmosphere (hidden oldskool pizza joint within the Cosmo where you can get your PacMan on while waiting for smelly good pizza) . . - Fantastic pizza (take away to your room or hangout in the Cosmo and enjoy a fancy cocktail with a homemade fresh ingredient pizza pie) . . - Two thumbs way up! (this place has become a new vegas staple for me)
It is simply the best pizza you will find in Las Vegas and perhaps west of the Mississippi. If you come from the tri-state area , and I'm not talking about Arizona Utah Mexico, you must stop off at this amazing home away from home pizza place. NO RANCH!
Hey white slice pizza...I want you badly!  . . This simple secret pizza joint found somewhere on the 3rd floor at the Cosmo in Vegas is serving crack pizza and they are calling it "The white slice". . I don't know what's on it, it's so simple and plain...just some kind of cheese and maybe some garlic? I dunno, but it is PHENOMENAL! I actually ordered a slice with a bunch of stuff on it cuz the "white slice" looked so plain, but I took a bite of my friend's and liked it better than the one I ordered! I went back and ordered it 2 more times. . . I think they close around 4am because when I first went to try it, it was closed :( I wanted to try it after seeing it featured on a TV show couple years ago and I always remembered it and boy am I sooo glad I did :) I dream about this pizza every night! I need this pizza in my life!!! . . THE SECRET'S OUT!!! :D
Drunk pizza is good pizza but not always. Such as when you realize after waiting for half an hour in line, you wish you called Pizza Hut for delivery service to your room instead. The best part of Secret Pizza is meeting funny and chatty drunk patrons in line.
By my fourth night in Vegas -yes I said fourth night I did not have the energy to rage all night long into the morning. After a long nap I woke up with a huge craving for something hearty. I opened up the Yelp app and the first place that popped up under my bookmarks was "Secret Pizza". Using the pics from other Yelpers, I was able to navigate up to the third floor and find the hallway that leads to this pizza joint. I ordered a whole pie with meatball, sausage, and mushrooms. After waiting for about 20 mins for the pizza to be done, I walked back to Vdara (where I was staying) and went HAM on this pizza. It was so good! First of all its thin crust, I love thin crust pizza. The toppings were well balanced because I know the meats were rich in flavor so I had to have mushrooms to balance that out. The best part was I was able to bring it home and enjoy this wonderful pie in the comfort of my home while recovering from the week long rage fest in Sin City!
This place, unfortunately, is now not a secret! Great pizza!. . Food:. I ordered the pizza by the slice that included ricotta, sun dried tomatoes, and meatball.. . The pizza looked like it had been sitting out for a long time and they threw it back in the oven to re-heat, but it still tasted really good! I was expecting some mediocre pizza that had been sitting out, but I was pleasantly surprised how good it was!. . Sides Notes. . Ambiance:. There's not really much of a decor. It's small and there may be about seven bar seats.. . Service:. The service was average.. . Overall:. If you're looking for pizza in Vegas, this is the place to check out.
Who doesn't want pizza after hitting the clubs?! We had a hard time finding this place and there was no signs directing us either, I guess this place really wants to be kept a secret! We got here around 3am after seeing Tiesto and was starving. I ordered the plain cheese because I wanted to keep it simple. Thin crust and lots of cheese, just the way I like it. If you want pizza after hitting the strip stop by this place. I won't give you directions to make it a more fun experience trying to find this place, but once you do you'll never forget where it's located.
If you are reading the yelp for this place there is a significant chance you are drunk and coming here anyway. So what's left to say? . . As difficult to find as delicious NY style pizza in the West. But you will find both and all will be golden. Best of luck on your quest!
