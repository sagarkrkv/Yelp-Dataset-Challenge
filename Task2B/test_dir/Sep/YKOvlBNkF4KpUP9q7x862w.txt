From the moment we stepped in, our experience was outstanding. Reservation confirmed via phone, promptly seated, and perfect lighting in a historic building. Our server was well spoken and very knowledgeable, but most of all he was attentive. The food was among the best upscale Latin cuisine I've encountered. It's an insult to call this a Mexican restaurant, because people will go in expecting Spanish rice and chimichangas. Instead, you have the pleasure of dining on pork confit with cilantro inside a fresh tortilla warmed on a salt block at your table. Just a wonderful experience from top to bottom.  Bravo!
We had reservations and still waited over 30 minutes for a table.. while that may have taken away a star, a busy restaurant is a good restaurant, no? The fresh guacamole was yummy, and the pork belly app is to die for. I could have eaten more than one order of those and my mouth is actually watering thinking about them. Drinks were a little pricey, but they were good. Restaurant is really sexy- great for a date night, but hard to hear (it was loud!) the portions are small so order up.
it was good.  guac was good.  menu was a bit limited though.
Great food. Nice setting. I had the Jodie Chicken which was extremely well seasoned. It was served on a fantastic paella like rice smothered with Oaxaca cheese.... sounds rich but this was delightful to my palette.  The table side guacamole is a must.  We had it spicy and it set the tone for a flavorful meal to follow.  ....this is definitely a place to revisit.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable, attentive and helpful.
We decided to venture "off campus" while staying at The Phoenician and The Mission came highly recommended.  We ended up on the back patio which was comfortable despite the heat!  Service was amazing and the food was fantastic.  We opted for the table-side guac (obvs) and an array of tacos.  My husband and I are taco lovers and we both agreed, these were the best we had had in AGES.  We were with a kiddo but The Mission would be a great destination for a girls night out or a super fun date night.  Highly recommend.
OMG. One if the best meals in Scottsdale.  Started with table side guacamole made on the spicy side - perfect. margarita Cattalac was perfect. . Then the skirt steak follow by the churros with side if milk shake -  perfect. . By far the most satisfying and tasteful meal!!. I highly recommend The Mission. I WILL be back.
This place is amazing!  Went there last night with three of my girlfriends.  The Pozole is incredible.  You must order this!  It's robust flavors will make your taste buds dance with glee!  Their tacos may be small, but they have BIG flavor.  If you order tacos as your main course, be sure to add a collection of sides.  I suggest the white and black bean puree, the chipotle honey creamy grits and the street corn.  For desert, you absolutely need to order the pumpkin bread pudding.  Don't leave without ordering the pumpkin bread pudding.  I mean it!  Call ahead for a reservation because this place gets busy and you may not get a table otherwise.  Love The Mission!
In town for a business meeting and hoping for a good Mexican restaurant nearby.  Yes, this is a trendy place in Scottsdale that people go to park their $20,000 BMWs and oversized SUVs and think that living there actually means something in between their salon appointments and residential real estate sales.  Now onto the food and drinks.  Ordered the cucumber jalapeno margarita for $13. Amazingly, it was delivered to me in less than 1 minute so I'm sure it was prepared that morning in a pitcher and tasted like any generic margarita I've ever had, just spicier.   The food was also mediocre. I ordered the tacos and was told it was small but I didn't expect 3 tacos that are 2" in diameter and delivered in less 5 minutes. Clearly this also wasn't cooked to order and probably just heated up.  Absolutely nothing memorable about this food. The 4-star reviews just baffle me and I wonder if it's the scene more than the food. Given the location, it's clearly the scene.
I went to the Mission during restaurant week.  The food was so good and the service was ok.  I know its restaurant week but there was really no one there.  But I would highly recommend going.
Highly recommend the guacamole, street tacos & 5 pepper soup. Love the ambience... Warm, elegant and always inviting!
Found this restaurant on a Yelp search...was in town for the weekend with a girlfriend and wanted good food, and fun atmosphere. . The Mission was both!. We liked the cocktail choices, but asked if the bartender would make slight changes (vodka instead of tequila) and they were happy to oblige , and were delicious. Had a pineapple/mint with ginger combo...tasty with Vodka. . . We shared the table made guacamole which was good, not spectacular like some reviews here ...and we shared the pulled pork tacos for two. Yes the homemade tortillas are small (about 2 1/2 in. diameter) but there was plenty of the pork, and very delicious. Came with sides of roasted tomato salsa, a honey bar b que sause, onions and cilantro...the tortillas are kept warm on a warm block of salted rock..it was lit from underneath somehow. . Creative and pretty presentation. . Plenty of food for two women who didn't want to be stuffed. . Waitress was sweet, helpful , pretty and smiled each time she spoke to us and served us. . Bar and restaurant were full on a friday night with a younger, energetic crowd. . Happy we went! Enjoy!
Best Mexican food ever!  Awesome atmosphere as well, drinks were excellent. If I had to be picky, I would say the servers were a little slow to bring fresh drinks.
I was in Phoenix for some business meetings and it was recommended that we check this place out for dinner.  We decided to go here for some appetizers and drinks since it was still early and then head out to another recommended restaurant later.. . The food: We ordered the Table side guac and the crispy pork w/cola lime glaze.  The guac was excellent, and we couldn't get enough, but the real surprise was the salsa that they brought over when we got there.  This salsa was AWESOME.  The waitress mentioned that they roast the tomatoes and make their own salsa at the restaurant.  If I thought for a second I could get it on the plane home I would have asked her give me a cup of it for the road.  SO GOOD.  Then we had the crispy pork, which was a perfectly cooked pork belly thing with sweet barbecue type sauce (but better!) on it.  So good.  We should have stayed here and had dinner instead of going somewhere else.  After we finished dinner at the other restaurant I suggested (only half joking) that we go back to The Mission and have a second dinner... but it was too late.. . The decor of the restaurant was really cool, very dark.  Unfortunately, I was there with another male co-worker, so the ambiance was a bit wasted on us.... . I highly recommend.  If I am ever in the area again, I'm definitely staying for dinner!
Amazing food, especially the Peruvian soup
Great little latin place... . The pozole is excellent, highly recommend it, as is the table-side made guacamole (even though that's a little gimmicky and it took forever to get). . . The flat iron was very well cooked and really flavorful, paired perfectly with the charred leaks and little tomatilla salad but the portion was very small.. . I'd come back if I'm in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.
Jamar is saving this account their dumbass manager. Their manager has horrible customer service he is an ass and I can't believe he has a good job. This place is beautiful but come on- ure in the industry and u gotta talk to ppl and not lie about seating. Jamar is the man- a great server. The free samples of marg are tasty. Hands down the Margs are the best I've had for a while. The salsa is delish!!!!! The tacos and chips and salsa are great. This is coming from a huge Mexican food  fan ( born and raised in Cali) and good is delish!
Caution: this place is dark, very very dark, watch out your steps!. . Another check off on my foodie list, pleasantly surprised with everything here!. . Shrimp Anticuchos. -  Great start! A lot of bold flavors on a 3-shrimp skewer, do not skip it!. Chorizo Porchetta - A very rich dish for my taste, as it was recommended by our waiter. A big piece of pork shoulder had probably 35% of fat on a bed of chorizo, I got full after finishing barely half of it. If you have a big appetite, give it a shot. Malbec Braised Short rib - the guys finished this without any left, i guess this is enough said.. Espresso churro with milk shake - This is such a cute dessert, perfect to share for 3 people. Milk shake was good, though I didn't think the churro was flavorful enough as it called 'espresso churro', and they were quite oily. . . Overall our experience was great, every single dish was prepared well with very nice presentation, I call them photogenic kind of dish. Service was great, high noisy level and dark, very dark....
Short and simple. The food is worth it and the ambience is perfect for a date night. If you're looking for the wow factor then please make a reservation at The Mission. Bread pudding was to die for. Our server was pretty bad but he might have just been having an off night. Definitely worth checking out for a special night out.
Reservations definitely recommended on the weekends and very LOUD in the main room most of the time. The patio is our preference when it cools down. I suppose the main LOUD room would be a good place for that "it's not me it's you" conversation, because everybody is already screaming at each other to be heard when the drinks start flowing.. . Wonderful quieter helpful service on the patio, excellent food, smaller size portions, good guac and chips made at your table for another $12, it adds up fast here but tasty. Really enjoyed the Shaved Kale Salad with heirlooms, blood orange, goat cheese & marcona almonds. . The dish we are still talking about was a soup appetizer, Almejas Al Vapor, . a Peruvian clam stew with rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, just fantastic.. So if you are trying to keep the bill down just have soup and salad and some of their excellent Sangria. Otherwisewe had the Grouper which was a very small serving and a little overcooked, and the Pork Shoulder was excellent but again not a very large serving for the price. So be careful as you may leave here poorer and still hungry if you don't fill up on the better appetizers in our experience.. We are STILL talking about the Peruvian clam stew, best sopa on a two week busyness trip/vacation, do it.
Definitely make a reservation and be prepared for the darkness inside - kind of noisy too. If you don't mind those things, this place is amazing. The service is top-notch and our server (Tony, I believe) recommended some great dishes. In fact, we ordered pretty much everything he suggested and loved it all. . . First, the tableside guac. SO good. We got medium and wished we got spicy as it was barely spicy, but it was still delicious. Huge chunks of avocado and the chips are amazing - and the salsa is unique and tasty. They're also very generous with extra baskets of chips. I had a couple of their signature Primaritas, which were delicious and the rest of the drink menu looked great as well.. . For entrees, we ordered the marinated jaribo chicken and the chorizo porchetta. I only tried the rice from the chicken dish, because apparently it was too good to share :) The porchetta is a generous portion and very rich, but incredible. The edges are so crispy and amazing and the garlic sauce is great. We were too stuffed for dessert, unfortunately.. . It is a little pricey, but very worth it.  Fantastic place for a cozy date night - can't wait to go back!
