This was my first, yet definitely not the last!. . The Wynn property overall was simply exquisite! My absolute favorite feature of the resort was the understating of the casino. In most vegas hotels it's all about the casino, Wynn did it right by making the focus your luxury experience and the overall resort offerings!. . We stayed on the 57th floor and had a panoramic king suite, the view was simply magical! We couldn't stop taking pictures! The room was incredibly spacious and amazingly decorated! Every detail in every design was thoughtful planned out. The overall aesthetics of the hotel were over the top elegant and marvelous to behold!!. . One can not simply say enough positive things about Encore or the Wynn. We are planning our return trip in November and look forward to exploring more and more of the amazing five star resort!. . If your debating, please look no further!! Your stay couldn't get any better if you tried! The cuisine And overall atmosphere are well worth the price tag.
Encore is by far the best Casino in Las Vegas. Everthing from decor, service, rooms, food, pool, and nightclub is top notch.. Such a great atmosphere with good looking people..  i think is safe to say I will probably never stay at any other casino..
I have been to Vegas several times and this past Labor Day weekend I got stranded away from my friends with no money no phone and no ID. And I met one of the employees there who allowed me to use her phone to call my sister. Her name was Liza. She bought me a shirt dinner and did everything she could to make sure that I got home. Also the valet pep in the front were equally caring and nice one of the valet (Estella) paid money out of her pocket to make sure that I got on a Greyhound home. Not only is the hotel amazing and it has great night clubs and day clubs but I have never been around a staff who was so helpful they literally allowed me to get back to Los Angeles and save my life. Im so grateful and will make sure I continue to only go there when  I go to Vegas.
Exceptional service every time here.. . The journey to the pool was a surreal experience in it of itself (partly due to medication)...akin only to what I imagine what Adam and Eve felt like wandering Eden.  Luminous, sweet aromas, absolutely pristine...and nudity (european style section).  . . A quick glance was all I needed to know the fruits were a little too ripe for my liking -- on the verge of falling off.. . Booked 2 connecting Panoramic Suites facing the Strip.  Never wanted to leave the room.  In-room dining was available 24/7 and not ridiculously priced.  . . Bonus: Tacos El Gordo was literally a 5 minute walk away.. . http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-gordo-las-vegas-2
Encore is still as classy as ever, but unfortunately everyone now knows how amazing the hotel is!  Upon arriving, I was greeted by a tiresome, 40 minute wait to check in. The staff were apologetic and passed waters around, but nonetheless, the usually efficient process to get a room key was overshadowed by the long line. I never want to wait 4 mins for anything. (I pull out of gas stations when there is a line.  I take items out of my basket to make quick check-out in the grocery store). So the 40 minute wait pretty much  marred my arrival at Encore.  I understand that it was a holiday weekend.  I also understand that people like to party it up in the city.  Since there were beach parties at several of the clubs, I had to play dodge the drunkies a few times.  Also, there were large swimsuit-clad groups blocking the way across the esplanade.  I pretty much don't stay at MGM or New York just to avoid this! I also don't want to hear club music from my room, but at least the latter days of my stay were far calmer in the hotel and I could have a more relaxing trip.. . The best part are the rooms which are spacious and simple. Luckily,  I booked far enough in advance during a promotion that the rates were far lower than what I usually pay.  I noted that they changed their toiletries from the lemongrass scent (that was strangely similar to cleaning product) to a far more pleasant vanilla coconut blend.  There were ample towels.  The pillows were firm, but fluffy and my room was super clean!  I still enjoy this hotel and the fact I can walk to the mall across the way as well as the shops in Palazzo easily.  Another plus is that their Red Card program is pretty good in terms of comping (buffets, show tickets, game credit, hotel rooms) if you gamble there.
how time flies. Everything was fantastic. Great hotel,Very clean,Staff nice.. We forgot to take the teethpaste, I called the front desk. They brought it to me at once.
With hotel rates at it's all time high, there is a reason why every penny spent is worth it at Encore. The scent of the hotel, staff, cleanliness, decor, art, Egyptian cotton bedsheets, remote controls lights and drapery, gardens always manicured by an internationally renowned, imported sculptures, luxury shops and restaurants, gigantic gold course, European pools, and most notably the easy access to XS and Surrender. . . I will keep coming back here since I have never been disappointed. There are no complaints what so ever.
Best hotel in Vegas . The rooms are luxurious with floor to ceiling windows with a very nice view. The pool area was absolutely fantastic . Lots of good restaurants to pick from . We went to see David Guetta performing at XS, the club is beautiful and everything was good until security ruined our night. for no reason they go into the bathrooms and start knocking on the doors. . Other than that we enjoyed our stay and will go again .
They claim your room type isn't Ready yet at check in them offer to "upgrade" you for $20 a night to one that's ready.  Total scam since room is exactly the same.  Have stayed her numerous times and this will be last.  Agreed to pay the $20 for a quite room.  They put me right next to elevator and was woken up each night.  Toilet was running and TV didn't work.  Spoke w/ 2 managers and they wouldn't credit the $.  Staying at SLS next time.
Our room was 6209 and that was an upgrade we paid more per night for to get a panoramic view. The view was facing north, not much to see, disappointing, definitely not worth paying extra for as the room was almost $275 per night before taxes and before the upgrade charge. The room was spacious and looked very nice, but after awhile we noticed a bad odor in the closet and bathroom that stuck around our entire stay (3 nights). We were surprised the internet was an additional $15.99 plus tax per night and that there was not a coffee maker in the room. If you wanted to use the fridge in the room that had mini bar items in it (which we did not want), that was also extra. Also, the$275 per night did not include any resort amenities, that was also extra. Basically, the hotel nickel and dimes its guests for everything. The bed was very comfortable and the furnishings were nice. The grounds were very nice as well. The final $950 plus bill was not worth it.  However, Antionette, who worked in housekeeping, was very friendly and helpful and definitely understands good customer service. Overall impression, the place over promised and under delivered. Update: 9/25/14, an Encore representative called and apologized for issues we had. He promised a refund of the upgrade charges to our credit card.
I can only speak to the ambience of the hotel and casino. It's very refined and sophisticated. After several adventures at the Silver Legacy, Paris and Nugget, I introduced my friends to the Encore and upon walking into the main lobby their jaws dropped. I says 'Welcome to Vegas, the way it should be done'. . . Beautiful gambling spaces, beautiful people and a clean albeit busting environment. As other reviewers have mentioned the ease of access to the prime clubs and locations on the strip is unparalleled!
Great hotel!! Great service! Great casino!! The hotel is beautifully decorated. Wynn really goes all out with his 2 hotels ! They have everything you can want! All the restaurants are amazing!!
