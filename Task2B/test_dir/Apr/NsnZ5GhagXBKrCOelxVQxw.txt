So good, we went back TWICE in 7 days! . . The first time we went, we were a group of 17 who found a last minute reservation. The menu itself is fantastic, but their options for how to serve people are great too! For example, you can give them a price range, and they'll go over the dietary restrictions of the group, and put together an AMAZING family style meal. Definitely recommend doing it that way with large groups.. . For our second time, we were a slightly smaller group, walk-in, of 11, who managed to get a table right away (another large group had just left, coincidentally, were friends of ours). Again, they offered the same setup, and we took it, but this time we had a few with dietary restrictions. They took those requests, and brought out all plates for family style. The vegetarians received their own personal entree catered to their requests as well, but we all shared starters and other bites.. . They were attentive and fabulous! I definitely recommend EVERYTHING about them.
I came here with my boss and coworker during a business trip in Vegas. Boss was not a huge fish fan but agreed to go after I nudged him a bit about it. . . We ordered the sea bass, a couple of entrees and some appetizers. I can't remember exactly what they were but one of the appetizers (hamachi) was so freaking amazingly good. The sauce was spot on. I finished the fish but kept the sauce as a dip for future dishes. It was that good. The sea bass was also delicious and everyone at the table agreed on its excellency. . . Price wise, of course it's more pricey $$$ but worth the ambiance, service, and sushi.
The sushi was just marginal.  I've had much better sushi in Iowa.  It doesn't compare to San Francisco Sushi.  The prices were outrageous. The atmosphere wasn't great.  Very disappointing.
I'm such a sushi addict, andevery time I come to Vegas I HAVE to eat here. The staff is amazing and service is impeccable. They have a variety of dishes and sake....how could you not get sake with your meal? . . My favorite menu items are the yellowtail sashimi and the rock shrimp tempura. The yellowtail comes with this amazing sauce, I can't even explain how good it is. The place is loud, but isn't that the point of being in Vegas? . . It's a perfect spot to go before hitting the clubs and casinos, you'll be sure to get full here ! . . Order the rock shrimp tempura. Thank me later !
A Brazilian-Peruvian-Japanese fusion restaurant that made me think that the whole "fusion" thing had gotten out of hand. But it was a great meal. The vibe is a little loud, but this is Vegas, so in context, it's not a serious issue. Our waiter seems like a really nice guy but a little slow. It was pretty full.. . The wagyu beef was served with mushrooms and a ponzu sauce that was a tad strong. We had the more traditional of the ceviches on the menu and it was truly extraordinary. Sashimi was awesome and the dragon roll was good too. Dessert was the banana chocolate cake which is one step removed from heaven. . . Overall commendable, even at the steep LV strip price.
We came here for my sisters bachelorette party and it was wonderful. My sister can't eat gluten, dairy, or onions, and one girl in our group doesn't eat raw fish. When they offered to put together their own menu for us, accommodating all of these requests, I was skeptical. They totally came through! We all felt that we had a great meal and plenty offood and our waiter Kylie made sure to point out which foods my sister could and couldn't have so she didn't get sick.
Food is great and creative here. They have a very limited Nigiri and Sashimi selection, but it's all grade A fish. They seems to specialize more in these off the wall rolls that will get your taste buds going crazy. Service isn't bad, but our waiter seemed to be spread thin between the tables he had. Overall prices are a bit expensive. Average roll is $20 and that's for 3-4 pieces. Each nigiri sushi piece was $4-$6 and the Toro was $16 per piece. Yes I understand that sushi at this great quality can be found cheaper near your home, but let's face it, the rent on Las Vegas Blvd. isn't cheap!!
Fun fun! Took a large party here for dinner and it was delicious! I give it 3 stars because I felt like the servings were  skimpy on the Kobe beef and some of the sashimi- and they didn't do a great job placing the items ( like the hot stone to cook the Kobe beef) within reach of everyone on the table. For the prices ( I selected the 100 dollars a person option) I felt like there should have been better service in this area. Also some of the dishes to pass that had sauce on them ended up getting spilled on some of my guests and it was a little awkward having to wipe the melted butter off the shirt of the guy next to me. Maybe they need deeper dishes for those items to prevent this from happening. The fish was grade A and the sushi was fantastic. Everyone loved the food once it made it on their plates and it was different from any other sushi experience I have ever had. I'll be back!
Great Sushi and Sake Options. Sat at the Sushi bar though and I thought it was a little weird that we didn't order from there but that is non issue to me really. The ambience is ok, a little loud and hard to talk but that might just be the part of the restaur I was sitting in.
I would have to really try hard to find a place in Vegas that didn't serve good food. I'll have to try the one in NY but everything served was fantastic.
Japanese-Peruvian-Brazilian food. It works. the fusion food trend has been over for a while but this place is really fantastic. Unique food that works, is playful and delicious. this is a hidden gem that stands out from a lot of very good but cookie cutter Vegas experience like the overdone steakhouse.
The perfect date night spot!. . Had a really cool modern ambiance. They had these videos from Asia playing on their TVs and we thought that was pretty interesting. The bathrooms were clean and very modern.. 5/5. . The hosts that greeted us at the door were all really clean, pretty and professional.. Particularly the short Asian girl with the long red hair.. 5/5. . Our waitress was nice, but she didn't explain the menu to us very well. She could have been a little more helpful because it was our first time there and the menu was a little complicated at first glance.. 3/5. . The food was seriously incredible!!. . Started off with a mushroom appetizer, mushroom tobanyaki w/ kobe, which ended up being a lot larger than I had expected, but I wasn't complaining at all. I had an egg added to it, which was recommended by the host with the red hair.. We also got an order of a5 wagyu gyozas and kobe beef taquitos with sea foam sauce. The sauce was a really nice twist to a classic. All really amazing. . 5/5. . The drink menu was really great. For date nights I like to try specialty cocktails instead of my usual whiskey. I ordered a mango mojito and my boyfriend had an old fashioned. The mojito was a little bit too sweet for my liking but wasn't bad.. 4/5. . The sushi was well made but I wasn't exactly blown out of the water and neither was my boyfriend. He and I are avid sushi eaters and we love complex rolls with a lot of flavors and textures to them. So the Lima roll and San Paulo roll were both just decent. We could have gone without them.. 3/5. . Our entrees were really what impressed us. My boyfriend had a Charrasco: Rio Grande  and he absolutely loved it. It was excellently paired with a variety of sauces. I'm not much of a red meat kind of eater but I had a small slice and was fairly impressed.. 5/5. . I had the large plate of chicken teriyaki. Wasn't crazy about it but I definitely finished the whole dish. It was a little small compared to my boyfriends main dish but it was okay with me since we ordered so many dishes.. 4/5. . Overall we had a really great date night here and would definitely come back for another one. Loved it
There are some incredible offerings here, but you have to read the menu closely.  . . Service is not bad, but very substandard for Vegas and this cuisine. Expect kids who are distracted. . . The best thing here is the Yamato "roll" which is basically a tuna roll with foie gras and gold leaf on top. Amazing. I recommend you try it.
Every time I come here they take care of me. Thank you Jason for your hospitality. The food and service is superb.
This place is great if you're having a late-night sushi craving, closes around 2am on prime nights. All the rolls/dishes we ordered were decent/good but nothing to rave about or life changing. Kind of on the pricey side but that's a given in Vegas, especially in Palazzo/Venetian.
SUSHISAMBA fuses Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian flavors- peculiar, until you realize that Brazil is home to the largest Japanese population outside of Japan itself.. . From edamame to plantains, wasabi to chiles, SUSHISAMBA is a true testament to the unique tastes created by immigration and integration and the balanced evolution of these flavors over the last 100 years. . . Having visited the Las Vegas location several times as well as the Miami one, SUSHISAMBA is high on my list of culinary experiences that delights time after time.. . Among my favorites is Yamato roll, comprised of tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar, topped with gold leaf. At $19 for 3 pieces, you may have to take a sledgehammer to that piggy bank, but you probably won't regret it.  . . Another outstanding roll is the Bobo Brazil, filled with avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, and chimichurri inside, layered with tender seared wagyu beef on the outside. Every bite melds into the tongue and disappears in a flurry of flavor.. . I tried the Kanpanchi Tiradito on this last visit and didn't find it worth the $19. Drizzled in yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, the 4 small slices of amberjack were acceptable but not exceptional.. . On a final note, our waitress looked like a gorgeous supermodel, which worked out great in curbing my own appetite, thus making the meal more affordable. I already started a new piggy bank for next time.
This place is so much fun.  The atmosphere is hip, the music is energizing, and the menu is incredible!  The rock shrimp tempura appetizer is absolutely amazing, and I love they cover it in a black truffle vinaigrette.  For dinner we had sushi, and it was delicious!  The only downfall of the restaurant is that the tables are SUPER close together, so it is really loud in there and you have no privacy.  Hey, that's typical Las Vegas though!
The sushi is always great and the food always looks likes its ready for a sexy date "all dressed up"
Fantastic dining experience from beginning to end, we came at peakbusiness hours, the hostess greeted us and asked if we would like to wait 15 minutes for a table or immediate seating available at the sushi bar (we opted for the latter). Host walked us to the bar (didn't just point and direct). When we sat down, immediately visited by our server to take our drink order and tell us about some specials. The food came fast, surprising us because it was peak hours!. . Even more was when I tried to wave down our server to order an additional plate, she didn't see us, and the manager (young guy in a suit) came to us within seconds and asked what he could do, he took the order without hesitating (instead of just saying he will call the server over).. . We had the spicy edamame, beef dumplings, Chilean sea bass, and samba split. ALL came out within minutes, presented beautifully (can check out the photos) and tasted even better than they looked!. . Service was incredible. We asked for hot water with lemon, and even though I didn't touch mine, they replaced it with a fresh one when it became cold! WOW!. . The atmosphere is fun, fits sushi perfectly.
Fantastic ambiance, quick service and food was delicious. The best one was the kobe beef roll, and octapus roll.
If you want the best sushi ever go here!!! The wagu on the hot stone a must order!! Everything was amazing!! Ate here 4 times in one week!! Loved everything!!
Updated:. Just want to clarify that the service is great! Which is why I gave two stars for the service, otherwise I would give it the lowest possible. . . Food sucks for the price. I've had waaaaaaaay better sushi in California. C'mon, I know it's the Palaazo but still... . . Disappointment.
Absolutely positively one of the best dinning experience I have had in Vegas in ... forever. The food is AMAZING and its comes out so damn fast. . . SUPER Big Props to the Manager Jason Pietrantoni- This guy is outstanding. Very friendly- has some great recommendations and is one of the reasons we will be coming back with a very large group. . . Do NOT mess with or listen to the negatives comments on here-- they don't know what they are talking about. This place is a notch above the rest.
Chilean sea bass is amazing!
Excellent!
Sushi Samba is the perfect place to grab some dinner and cocktails before heading out to a club, concert or show with your group of friends. It may be too loud for an intimate date unless you're going for lunch.. . Our server was great but the hostesses were bitches. We arrived a little early to the podium with no greeting. Hey, smile and greet. That's pretty much your only job besides answering the phone and seating! We were not able to be seated until the scheduled reservation time so we sat at the bar to start off with some drinks while we waited. The food was good. We ordered the Wagyu beef gyoza, assorted sashimi and hamachi tacos. The sashimi is the new age fusion kind with the Yuzu sauces and  jalapeno topping so don't expect it to be in its pure naked form like traditional Japanese restaurants. Maybe they do also offer it in its pure form but we didn't order or expect it that way and the quality of the fish is mediocre so you may not want it that way anyway. . . I'll definitely be back!
We found this restaurant on yelp. It has a 4 star rating but it deserves 5 for sure. We had one of the best dinners we have ever had. The food is incomparable. Absolutely delicious! The sushi was so fresh and tasted clean. We also had two orders of the sea bass. One was not enough. Melt in your mouth heaven! We will be making a special trip to Vegas just to eat here again. The service was also outstanding.
I'm from Los Angeles, so I know sushi, and I grew up in New England, so I know lobster.. . It's 1:30 in the morning and we're in Vegas.  We're hungry, and tired and just wanted a good meal.  We found this place on Yelp with good reviews and decided to check it out.. . I ordered the lobster robata, which the waiter described as lobster cut in half, grilled, and finished with a sauce.  This sounded a lot like the way lobster is prepared in Mexico and I'm starting to see in other restaurants particularly in San Diego.  So I was excited to have it this way again.. . What a disappointment - what came to me was only half a lobster, the size of which could not have been anywhere near a pound.  It was grilled well and the sauce was very tasty.  . . But seriously, for $25?  If I spent that much back home on lobster, I'd have enough to feed my entire family and still have some left over.. . My wife had the Lima, which was very good.  For sushi, it was not like what we get in LA, but it's worth noting that if I ever find myself here again, this may be what I order.. . The ambiance looks like Dr. Seuss on acid, but it was dark and cozy at the same time - it is an unusual setting.. . The meal ended quickly as they were closing and, after several attempts by the waiter to get us to order more food and drinks, we were given our bill.  As I'm signing my credit card slip, I hear our waiter burst out in a confrontation with three foreign women seated several tables from us who apparently did not know or feel obligated to leave the waiter a gratuity.  The debate got louder, but mostly from the indignance from our waiter.  I'm not saying he was right or wrong - I just think there was a better way to handle that situation.
The meal was absolutely fabulous!  Our waitress Vanessa G knew the menu well and was able to help us order the unfamiliar cuisine.  Really, one of the best meals we have had in years.... We ordered yellowtail taquitos, Wagu Gyoza, Ishiyaki (5) and Anti sea bass... I would highly recommend! Might have to spend a little more but it's definitely worth it!. I also liked that the manager Allen came and talked to us and was interested in how the patrons felt.
Wonderful food!  This is my second time at this restaurant and the food is always perfect. We'll definitely be back!
This happening spot is the definition of Asian Fusion done right. The staff was quick and friendly. With a fellow diner who is allergic to both fish and sesame, the waitress was extremely accommodating. . . The fish was very fresh and the rolls were fun and creative. To our surprise, we very much enjoyed everything we ordered! I was very pleased with the order of steak which was cut very well. . . The trendy vibe and hip decor sets this place above the bar. Not to mention, the full bar they have, which is a hotspot for young adults staying at the Palazzo or the Venetian. . . With great food and a great vibe, this place is definitely one to recommend!
Why did you ask me to contact you if you weren't going to respond? . . #youretheworst
