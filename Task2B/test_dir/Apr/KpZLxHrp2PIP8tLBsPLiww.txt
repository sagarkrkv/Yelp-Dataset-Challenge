We stayed in Tower 3 and requested the highest floor available, in our case it was the 37th floor. Our room was a One-Bedroom Suite with balcony plus strip view. The entire hotel -- from the gated entrance to the room itself -- seemed spotless and had a 'clean' smell. The room had a full kitchen w/full-size refrigerator), a wetbar with two barstool-type chairs, a dining table w/4 chairs, one large sofa w/pull-out queen bed, the balcony, the separate bedroom and master bathroom w/jacuzzi, and, of course, a SECOND FULL bathroom. . . The higher floor rooms with balcony offer some pretty amazing views. It was nice to get some fresh air anytime we liked instead of having to go downstairs and step outside without a view. Although not very big (maybe as big as a queen-size bed), the night-time views coupled with the extra wind from being higher up was alone worth the higher cost of the room.. . I only had 2 minor complaints: the walk from Tower 3 to the strip and the slightly cramped and older looking furnishing/layout. Now, I know the walk from Tower 3 to the strip isn't THAT bad, but it was my first time staying at a hotel that didn't have a casino or club that was just an elevator's ride away. I knew this coming in so I didn't deduct any stars from the rating. As far as furnishing and layout I will say it didn't feel like 950sq ft. The way the living room was setup it didn't give off an open feeling, but rather a narrow and cramped feeling instead. I think the wooden entertainment center was on the big side (taking away some space from the living area) and the cheap looking dining table was slightly small, yet kept 4 average-sized chairs. I can best compare their size to those outdoor tables and chairs you see at your local Starbucks. To me it looked as if it was an afterthought, like they realized they can squeeze a table with chairs in that empty space. Furthermore, across the sofa we see a small, glass table which I really felt like taking out of the room because it was a) older looking and b) almost near the middle path which one walked to get to the balcony. I am aware I am DEFINITELY nitpicking, but they were feelings I had during my stay and I feel it's important to share them because some of you may like a more open-type living are with more modern furnishing. These are not issues that would keep me from coming back again so there's no need to remove stars! The positives absolutely outweighed the cons.. . The 2 FULL bathrooms saved us a ton of time when it came to get ready. We had one guy in our party who literally takes an hour to shower, shave, etc.., so having that second bathroom allowed us to get ready without having to wait for that guy. Another lifesaver was the full kitchen. We brought lots of snacks and things we can heat up if we wanted a snack and this kitchen was loaded with appliances and pots and pans. The fridge had plenty of space for about 30+ beers and several bottles of alcohol (plenty for a 4 night stay).. . Finally, I would like to say that you get quite a bit for your money's worth at the Signature if you are okay with a little walk and if you don't have to absolutely have the most modern furnishing. I will be staying here again in the summer of 14' and I cannot wait to return!
Beware: we ordered breakfast to the room one morning, and it came to around $50, and SURPRISE we were actually charged $99 and change. What?  Really? At first it was a 'pending charge' on our card, so we thought it was going to go down to the actual price, but it never did. That's enough to convince us that we will never stay here again. Vegas has so many other great options.
The hotel is four stars  and the private owned ( Jet) portion three stars. You don't know before arriving which portion you'll be in. The staff is as accommodating  as possible given the different ownership involved. The walk from owner three to MGM proper is about ten mins and becomes a bit when you repeat it several times a day.  Otherwise a nice smoke free place
OMG! We went on a family vacation for my birthday, party of 4. The best experience I've had in Las Vegas since I was a child. The room is equipped with a full kitchen, whirlpool bathtub, a bathroom inside the master bathroom was amazing. The TV that popped up from the bedroom dresser....jaw droping. Watching TV from the whirlpool was  breathtaking with a fireplace on the screen. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel. It's worth every penny. Customer service was great along with room service. I was totally sold when my son left his phone in the room and realized it 4 hours later from the time we left. We emailed and spoke to Lost and found, the phone was back in his possession within a few days. Love this place and will definitely return!!
MGM Signature: Where COMPLIMENTARY means you will be CHARGED. . Overview:. . - Room was put on hold for me for my Birthday  .          - Was informed it was a Full House.          - Was informed there was never a room set aside .          - Was then informed I should have come earlier .            (which I did 2x but could not get to a front desk attendant). . Mr. Gonzales, mgr, informed me that they had a "full house" with "no available rooms". He left it at that and I gather he hoped I would go away. I informed him that this was completely unacceptable and unprofessional. If I was not to have a room, do not promise one to me. . . Mr. Gonzales offered to send Strawberries, Champagne,  Wine and a $50 Dining Credit to my room.  I requested late check-out and Mr. Gonzales agreed to 2pm to compensate for our delayed check in..  ________________________________________. . - Complimentary Strawberries & Champagne in new room.           - Room was given away. ________________________________________. . - Was told there were no rooms available   .           - Waited for me to leave the front desk. ________________________________________. . - Indicated to the mgr that this was not a professional way to handle  this matter.          - Offered a new room. ________________________________________. . - Complimentary Strawberries, Champagne and Wine  .          - I was Billed upon Check-Out. ________________________________________. . - Complimentary $50 Dining Credit    .          - I was Billed upon Check-out. ________________________________________. . - Complimentary Late Check Out    .          - Front Desk attempted to Bill Me. . The front desk called to "inquire" what time I was checking out. I said 2pm and she thanked me and informed me that I will be billed a $30 late check-out fee. I explained that Mr. Gonzalez said it was alright and she responded there were no notes on the account. ________________________________________. . - Old Food Served for Room Service   .         - Room Service refused to remove off bill. . The Room Service manager (Andrea?) called and wanted to know what was wrong. I explained that we did not eat the food and it was not fresh. She said she would send someone to "retrieve" it so they could "inspect [it] and show the Chef". I asked if it was removed off the bill and she said no, not until they retrieve and inspect. This made me feel dissatisfaction for the service and also like a low class citizen, as if I could not be trusted.. ________________________________________. . - Provided me a Bill (for Complimentary items above)  upon check-out. . In the Lobby, I saw Francisco whispering to a gentleman. Upon approaching the front desk, this gentleman introduced himself as Warren Sprague, manager. He apologized for my inconveniences and helped me check-out, handing me a bill for $223.84. I asked him what the bill was for and he explained it was for my room charges. I told him I had no room charges and asked for an itemized bill, he said he could not provide one. He then asked me to step aside (as he did not wish the other customers to hear) and said he would look into this for me.. . Mr. Sprague returns and informs me they are charges for "liquor". I asked him if it was the complimentary Champagne and Wine. He said there are no notes on my account regarding anything of that nature. . . Upon his return he said today was my birthday and he did not want me to leave the MGM Signature upset so this is what he will do for me: He will clear all my charges and I will leave with a Zero Balance. Thank you for offering me Chocolate Covered Strawberries, Champagne, Wine, $50 credit, Late Check Out and charging me for it! The MGM Signature billed me for everything after very clearly explaining to me that this will be "charged to the room and removed upon check-out". The reason?: "there are no notes in your account".  So much for a routine check-out.. . Disappointed would be an understatement. Put yourself in my shoes for a moment. Something like this should never happen to a customer, much less time and time again with the same customer. How many times should one apologize for Poor Communication in the short span of 13 hours? How could this much go wrong? How did something go from so wonderfully surprising to so terribly wrong in 13 hours? I do not believe I have ever heard the words "there are no notes in your account" so many times in my life, and yet, someone was able to find these mystery notes at a later time. In the past 12 months, the MGM has had 6 "Billing/Collection" complaints reported against them. I now understand why.. . Co-workers have suggested that I report this to my corporation as we should not be staying at a hotel which treats customers in this fashion, we shall see. We book there yearly and even rented out Hakkasan for WPPI. Definitely a lot invested there. . . I have sent a 6-page formal complaint to Ms. Jill Archunde Santell, General Manager via certified mail (received last week). I am now waiting their response.
The Signature at the MGM has gotten too popular and has started to go down hill.. . My husband and I stayed at the MGM in March about 3 years ago.  It was newer and fresher then.  We had a corner suite, it was nice & quiet, furniture was in great shape along with everything else in the suite.  We had no complaints.  We had such a good experience we decided to go back for our 1 year anniversary (about a year after we went their the 1st time).. . Upon our arrival the 2nd time, everything started out great.  Our room was ready early, the young lady at the front desk was very nice and the bellhops were ready to accommodate.  They gave us our keycards to get into our room and up we went.  When we arrived at the room it looked as if someone had thrown a HUGE party in it and all of VEGAS was there the night before.  Now I know Vegas is all about parties, however, this is now my room and all your partying should have been straightened/cleaned up by the cleaning crew.  There were stains on the wall (yes the wall had a very large stain on it), the couch, and the floors.  The lamps were broken, they were literally leaning sideways, the lamp shade on the ceiling light was turned sideways??? Really housekeeping, you didn't catch that.  Their were pubic hairs in the Jacuzzi tub......EWWWWWWWW.  Not for real!!!!. . I will say I called the front desk and they did transfer us to another room, but this is a building of SUITES only.  You are supposed to have excellent accommodations and expecting your guests to stay in a room like that is just disgusting . My 5 year old could have cleaned the room better.. . The hotel also was much nosier that what it used to be.  There were kids on the balconies yelling and just acting a fool and looking a hot mess. . . Oh, I almost forgot, their signature smell is so tacky.  As soon as you enter the towers you will know what I mean.  It smells like a group of gumdrops got together to projectile vomit all over the place.  Please choose a different fragrance to impose on your guests.  This one is too strong  and very annoying.
Edgar J.s review was pretty much spot on but I have a complaint about the check-in. I paid for the tower suite weeks in advance and was meeting my daughter and daughter-in-law there. My daughter-in-law (with child) arrived before me. She was not allowed to go to the room. She called me and I called the front desk. No matter what I said, they would not give her a key. She had to wait in the lobby for three hours until my flight arrived. Good grief. NOT a nice way to start our vacation.
We had a Balcony Suite for the weekend.  The two person jacuzzi was fabulous.  Our balcony was amazing with a beautiful view of the strip and pool in Tower 3.  We requested kitchen items when we arrived.  It took close to an hour before the items were delivered, but we ended up with a fully stocked kitchen and saved money preparing half of our meals in the room.  The strip is actually very close and the walk only took a few minutes.  . . I only have two complaints.  First, the bed was uncomfortable and I didn't sleep well either night.  The bed is slightly firm, but the biggest problem was the pancake feather pillows.  It was like sleeping on an extra layer of sheets without any neck support.  Maybe I'm just a feather pillow hater.  Second, the sound travels A LOT into the suites.  I think the tile entry way acts as an amplifier and we could hear people up and down the halls all day and night, doors slamming, etc.. . All in all, it was a great trip.  We would definitely stay again, but next time I'll bring my own pillow and maybe stick a towel under the main door to block some noise.
We came here for the fight at the MGM, and I'm definitely staying here again. We had a mini fridge, full kitchen, view of the strip, large TV, free wi-fi, room for 2 in the jetted tub ;). It only took minutes to check in, no walking thru a casino to get to your room. The room service food was good, and everyone very friendly and helpful.I liked how there is a walking bridge over to the MGM , and the little lounge on the way over is a great place to relax, saw a couple of celebrities there too.I kind of hate to review this place because for what you get for this price, I don't want the secret out. P.S. I booked this through Expedia.
nice hotel. not far from the strip. enjoyed my stay here. came out to $200 for two nights. theres no casino. and only valet parking is available. located right behind the mgm grand
Great stay. Great location in middle of the strip. Kitchenette, huge tub, windows that open, Starbucks downstairs, nice deli with made to order food at reasonable prices .
Shitty service. Not only were we given keys that didn't work, our lock ran out of batteries and we needed to wait an hour to get it fixed, but we were late for the guestlist so we were told it would take ten minutes when we got back to the hotel after we went home. We got back to mgm and it still wasn't fixed, and we had to wait another hour for the people to let us into our own hotel room that we paid for.
I should preface this by saying that I don't like staying in hotels at all. Staying at a hotel in Las Vegas? Forget about it -- yuck. I only stay in Las Vegas if the circumstances require it. The Signature at MGM Grand has changed my opinion about hotels completely. It is a wonderful hotel, for so many reasons:. . 1. It isn't in a casino, so it super quiet, peaceful and relaxing. I had guests visit during our stay, and they remarked several times that they felt like they weren't even in Las Vegas (in a good way).. . 2. Because the hotel isn't in a casino, it doesn't smell like smoke! At all! In fact, it smells fresh and botanical, like you're staying at a spa. . . 3. The Delights cafe, located on the ground floor of the second tower, lives up to its name: it has delightful food! Everything we ate from there was delicious, including their fresh fruit cups. My favorite was the Market Street sandwich. Their cinnamon rolls were huge and outstanding, too. I was so pleasantly surprised by this little cafe.. . 4. The rooms were super clean, including the carpets, which is one of the reasons I hate staying at most hotels: the carpets are usually filthy! At the Signature, I felt comfortable walking around my room without shoes. . . 5. The staff is super friendly. We saw several staff members as we were walking down the hall, and each greeted us with a smile. They even stand to the side to let us pass! Even the cleaning ladies greeted us in the hall and welcomed us to the hotel on our first day.. . My only complaint is that I couldn't stay there longer! That has never happened at any other hotel. If I have to come back to Las Vegas in the future, I'll be staying here again.
Just returned from easter week stay, fantastic hotel ! 1- bedroom suite tower 2 was perfect for two adults  and one child , terrific pools and hot tubs , not over crowded and very kid friendly. The housekeeping light was terrific , room was always clean within an hour after turning it on. Easy indoor walk to MGM, and taxis always available  ! Would have given 5- stars, but they did not accommodate our only request , we wanted a strip view badly, and got airport even after emailing concierge a few months prior. I would have simply paid more for the view.
Everything was great about this hotel, but one thing. and it's not even a major thing but i just thought i'd write it anyways, i mean it is a review right? :P. . I wish that they had call down service for valet..aka..hi, i am calling from my room to get my car to be pulled around please...for some reason they don't have this option which doesn't really make sense to me, why wouldn't they?? But that's just my two cents. the end. :)
Awesome hot tub. Free valet parking. Connected to MGM grand but entrance is through a private street. Great balcony views. Highly recommend this place. Francisco at the front desk offered amazing customer service.
