The Best. My husband and I love staying at the Palazzo for many reasons. Beautiful suites with extremely comfy beds for one thing; large tubs, marble showers for another. Large closets fit everything we pack and house those white fluffy robes I love so much.. . Valet parking is quick, easy and efficient. The service is impeccable. Guest services, bellhops, check-in people are accommodating and polite. Best of all, the room rates are EXTREMELY reasonable compared to any other hotel in its class. Visited a room that cost twice as much in the Bellaggio which was half the size of our palatial suite at palazzo and would NEVER trade.. . Pros: WiFi in every room; 3 tvs; pools; Canyon Ranch; attached to the Venetian, another excellent property; GORGEOUS; large clean suites; outstanding service.. . Cons: ? Can't stay here forever I guess. Sometimes we have to go home.
I have very much enjoyed staying here. Beautiful hotel, great staff and easy to and from fashion show as that's the reason why I was In Town for work for the last 6 nights of my stay here. Great casino and nothing to  crazy with partying but that's perfect for me as I was here for work and the restaurants and lounges were perfect.
Was here again for a trade show.  Our rooms got canceled by the booking agent and Suzanne, the front desk Manager, was able to get us rooms!  Thank Goodness!!. Again, the only drawback is the smell of food in my room.  I don't get it.
Meh. . This place is okay. I know it is the sister to the Venetian, but for some reason the Venetian's beds seem far more comfortable (I have stayed many times). . So here are the pros:. Free valet parking. Quick entrance from parking into the lobby. Reasonably quick entrance from the lobby to the room area. Decent security. Fast elevators. Free Internet. Separate living room and office area. Lots of space. Room service is decently quick. Housekeeping is thorough. . . Cons:. The couple of times I have stayed here, the bed was uneven. Higher on one side than on the other, and very uncomfortable. Old towels LOL run down with frayed edges.. Internet is slow. Shopping is just so so even though they boast it. Room service is very very very expensive. ($50 for one person for breakfast). The place is appearing rundown inside the suites. Valet is pretty slow even on a day that isn't busy. The pools. Both Venetian and the Palazzo pools kind of suck. There aren't many tables, the pools are very cold, and the crowd is the "don't really want to look" crowd. Not hot!. Almost no service by the pools either.. . Here's what I think they need to do:. Provide a separate blanket for the couch. I know I know. Would go along way to making the living room feel cozy after a long night.. Reconsider the price of room service.. Replace all of the towels. Replace the beds. Provide power outlets next to the bedroom nightstand for devices. Have the pool service people actually come by and service people. For three hours, not one person came by. People next to me were asking workers where the servers were and they just kept shrugging. One guy emptying the trash said there was only one server working all of the pools that day. . . Do some TLC to the rooms. They're looking run down - like their guests do after a long night of partying.. . If you have a choice between this place, Wynn, encore or cosmopolitan, I would personally suggest Wynn, encore or Cosmo. There is a reason that those hotels sell out quickly and this one ... not as fast.. . It's just "ok". Overpriced for what you get unless all you care about is a lot of square feet.
We had a great stay in the two queen suite. The room also had a L-shaped pull out sofa sleeper. The couch is actually more comfortable than the pull out, but that is usually expected. The bathrooms were very clean as well as the room in general. We had a great view of the golf course from the 40th floor for no extra charge. I would recommend this hotel and I will stay there again.
First time staying here for the ISC West convention. Beautiful hotel!! Every room is a suite.. I had 3 TVs in my room that I didn't even use. They had an issue with one of my coworkers reservation but that was her fault with the different names she uses. Besides that, great stay, nice gym. I didn't get to use the spa or the outdoor pool (too cold) but will be back for next years convention for sure!!
One time I stayed here back in Sept 2012, we walked in our room and it was absolutely dirty. Dirty diapers and unmade beds. We had to drop off our things and have room service clean our room up. A couple hours later it was ok. . . Now it's April 2014 and we walked in and our room was just fine. But room service did walk in while we were just relaxing and they apologized and walked out. Service was ok and the casino floor was fine. Nothing to rave about.
Ranked as one of the Top 25 Hotels in the continental US?  Really?  We were there for a conference and felt that the added features of a full office set would come in handy, as the upgrade to the Prestige Lounge.  While the Prestige Lounge was wonderful and worth the upgrade, the rest of our stay was riddled with issues.. . When we got to our room, the marble everywhere was filthy.  And it just went downhill from there, it started as little things and as they added up it became bothersome.   . . Dirty carpets where our pants collected the dirt and dust.  Remote control for the curtains had the battery low and we could not fully use this feature.  The area where we could plug in our phones behind the night stand was full of dirt and dust and I did not want to put my hand in there.  The printer toners were low and then the paper ran out.  It seemed that the room wasn't verified as "clean" and "ready" for a new set of guests when we arrived.  In addition to this, while they knew that we were two colleague women sharing a double queen room, the slippers were sized for a man.  It took them a day to get us the right slippers.  This wouldn't be an issue if we felt comfortable walking in stocking feet or barefoot.  During our stay, towels were not refreshed correctly, we were lacking washcloths several days.  Then a bath towel was provided as a bath mat.  Then as the room was cleaned, all of our bathroom products were moved and not placed back as found - my colleagues items where moved to my side an mine to hers.  We had placed everything on towels as we didn't trust that the room was clean.  I had to take stock of all my products nightly to make sure that they were all there.  This would be a minor annoyance if it was the only issue.  In the bathroom, the wall paper was peeling and there was dirt in the crevasses of thewater closet.  The check out process was a nightmare that I am still dealing with it.  . . We spent nearly a week at the Palazzo, so our charges were substantial.  The day before we were set to check out, we went to double check that the charges were correct, and they weren't.  They had the entire stay on my colleagues account, and the upgrade fees on my account.  The concierge desk said that everything would be fixed and we would get folios emailed to us.  We also set a time for the bell hop to come by in the morning to pick up our bags as I was presenting a session late morning and we had a flight within two hours of the end of my session.  We changed our mind on the time, and this was not communicated to the bell hop team.  Luckily, they came back to the room as requested.  After breakfast, we went to check to confirm that the charges were corrected and to request our folios be printed out since they were not emailed as requested.  The charges were in a SNAFU state, while they assured us that they would be correct, the folios still had the last four digits of my account! They double charged my card for the WRONG amount - to the tune of $300 per double charge (concierge gave us a minimal credit for the issues above).  They insisted it was correct, even showed me the screen with my colleagues charge card number!  Upon checking today, we found that the charges were incorrect and that the notes we left with all the issues listed above still had not been reviewed.  So right now, 3 man hours later (1/2 hour each on Friday, and 2 hours today), the issues are not resolved and I have not received a resolution to all of these issues.
I love the Palazzo. The location is great and guest service is always good. With that being said, I can see where the shortcomings are. . . First, the rooms are very nice, but can get dusty very quickly. I understand this given the environment and weather but there should be better filtration and circulation to alleviate this issue. Also, getting items brought up to the room can take a lifetime!! We called for towels twice and waited over an hour the first time only to be told that the towels had been "dispatched". The room service rates are absurd but that's par for the course in Vegas. In addition, they like to tack on miscellaneous "extras" to your bill so be sure to check it and finalize it BEFORE you leave. . . The positives are clearly the location and the shopping. The Palazzo is centrally located to just about everything and has a lot to do onsite. If you stay definitely get an upgraded room/suite. If your going to pay the money to stay there you may as well spend a few extra dollars and be able to really stretch out.
I have stayed at The Palazzo countless times and have always enjoyed myself. The rooms are decorated nicely and they have great room service food. The drinks in the casino have always been top notch, they don't skimp on the alcohol just because it's "free". I ONLY like to play video keno and ONLY on Game King Multigame machines. I've noticed they are becoming harder to find, not just at Palazzo, but anywhere. Some casinos don't have ANY and have replaced them with exclusive keno machines. Still, I can usually find what I'm looking for at Palazzo, even if I can't always sit next to my boyfriend. PLEASE don't take away any more of them, Palazzo! The people that tend to sit for hours on end play Game Kings!
I am only rating the experience based on time in the casino room due to fact I have yet to stay in room. . . The casino floor is a all out nice lots of gambling to be had, from floor games to slots and nice poker room.Ended up playing 1 cent slots for about 2 hours continually winning even hit a nice 1,100 in pennies win. . . Non smoke or if there is smoking you couldn't really tell.. . Very clean and lighted up nicely you can see what your doing. . . Negative some of the casino games are louder then I have ever seen. . . . Will be back to play though.
Room is amazing and HUGE.  really clean as well.  they take good care of the property.  gaming area is very tight, and slots SOOOO close together.  very crammed when crowded.  good selection of slots tho!  i didn't stay here, just got to see the room.  very impressed.
Love love love this place. . . Love the pool.  . Love the casino. . Love the staff. . Love the rooms. . Love the service
Staff is very responsive.  Hotel is very nice with sunken living room and 3 TVs which makes husband happy.  Classy people at a classy joint.  Casino isn't smokey.  Gave us late check out without a problem.  The Palazzo pool cabanas are really beautiful and our server Raul was great, cute and attentive.
Hotel is beautiful. Service is great. My only complaint is the room itself. We booked a two bedroom suite. And for that price, I was expecting a more spacious room with a kitchen along with a fridge and a microwave. Got none of that. During this same trip, I stayed at a different hotel for less than $100 a night and the room was huge with a full kitchen and living room, plus two baths! Just bummed that we didn't get the same amenities at this hotel for the price we paid. But, the bathrooms were quite spacious. It had a shower plus a bathtub and the toilet is in it's own separate room I guess you could say. Wouldn't mind staying here again, but only if I got a deal or something.
Got two connecting suites on the 45th floor. Nice view!...its just the farthest room from the elevator. The suites here are very spacious for a small group. But since we got two connecting suites it was more than enough room for a group of 8. . The only thing I have to point out about the room is their AC unit. You do not need to make an unnecessary loud beep from the push of the buttons lol I was trying to adjust it while everyone was sleeping...awkward. . . The bathroom and living room is the nicest feature of the suites. I definitely enjoyed my weekend stay here.. . Also, don't forget to leave tip for your housekeeper!
Love staying here! Especially if you have a big group of people.  View is amazing and the whole suite is just very comfy.  The pool here isn't bad either.
This is the sister property to the Venetian Hotel and is all suites!  I had a perfect experience and would highly recommend staying here when in Vegas.  It has everything including several restaurants by highly acclaimed chefs.
