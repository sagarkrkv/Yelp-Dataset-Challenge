I am really baffled by all the hate for Carnevino in the reviews. I first came here about 5 years ago when I cam to vacation in Las Vegas and have been back probably 10-15 times since I moved to Las Vegas. I always go when people are in from out of town and want a good steak place so I have been with about 20-30 different people. Never have any of us gotten a bad item, had bad service, or not loved it. I am a unapologetic fine dining snob and until Gordon Ramsay Steak opened this was my favorite steak restaurant in Vegas- and for the steak itself it is probably slightly better than GRK (GRK has better non steak dishes and desserts). I can't wait for someone else to visit so I can try the new beef tasting menu. . . The restaurant comes from Mario Batali (orange crocs) and Joe Bastianich (the mean judge on amster chef). If you have been to any of their other restaurants Carnevino is similar in many regards- formal fine dining atmosphere, similar slowly paced service, the waitstaff likes to talk etc. This isn't for everyone- some people just want to order their food and have it delivered in less than 10 minutes without a lecture on Italian after dinner drinks (Grappa by the way is an acquired taste- I almost gagged the first time I had it but now I love it). If you do go to Carnevino give yourself at least two hours and have a backup liver waiting for transplant. . . The Steaks. Usually I would start with appetizers but let's be honest- you are here for a giant slab of meat. . .  Here are the steaks I have had ranked in order. . 1. Bone in ribeye for two. This is carved tableside. If you like Ruths Chris serve your steak at 1500 degrees sizzling deal you might not like this as it is served more room temperature- and if it is warm at all the heat quickly goes away from the thinly sliced meat. It is very tasty though- the seasoning is very light so its all beef taste.. 2. NY Strip- not usually one of my favorite cuts but I have gotten it a few times for variety and it is better here than elsewhere I have had it.. 3. Bone in Filet- superior to the boneless IMO- has the very soft texture and less beefy taste you expect from a filet. . . Now, not always, but most of the time, they have a special steak that is aged longer- if this is available for the love of all that is holy get it. Pay whatever they ask- 100$ a pound, 200$ a pound, your first born- whatever it takes. These steaks taste like nothing you have ever had or likely will have again in the future. They have an almost blue cheese like flavor that is incredible. I have had plenty of expensive food that I would say was not worth it- this is not one of those. . . Non steak Items- I have ordered a few of these - pork chop, Osso Buco, and they are great- if you are a local and can come here frequently I highly encourage you to try them. If you are in from out of town though, you probably just want to get a steak or you will return him and find yourself lying awake in bed, filled with regrets.. . Appetizers- there are quite a few beef appetizers. You can go two ways with this- some people will find beef on beef on beef to be too much- we call them French. So if you are worried about your blood test results get something else, if you love America here are some suggested Apps (not all of these are beef but are meat). . . 1. Carne Cruda- raw beef good. . . 2.Prosciutto di Parma and Affettati Misti- picking between these two is slightly harder than Sophie's Choice. . 3. Beef Cappallacci -this has some really strong goat cheese which is amazing but may knock your socks off. . . 4. Anolini- lobster pasta- whats not to love
Probably the most disappointing $500 meal we (a group of 6) have ever had.. . 1). There were FIVE girls at the hostess station when we approached, and it somehow still took them a while to find our reservation.  They asked my friend whose name it was under to spell out her last name at least 2 or 3 times. Whatever. . . 2).  The steaks, which are supposed to be their star offering (CARNEvino) were a let down.  First, they were OVERCOOKED, which is even more atrocious given that the waiter, when we ordered, emphasized that their temperatures are a grade or two cooler than normal.  Both guys who ordered steaks ordered them medium rare, which, according to the waiter, is like a rare at other places. FALSE. Both steaks were on the well side of medium.  Although dry aged, the steaks did didn't have enough flavor to stand on their own, and they weren't seasoned at all.  If you're going to charge $50-$85 per person for a piece of beef, it better be top quality and perfectly cooked. This was neither.  I've had $35 steak in a strip mall in Fresno that was much better (see, Cracked Pepper Bistro). . . 3).  The pasta - another disappointment.  Four of us got pasta.  Another girl and I both had the pasta with lamb ragu, one had the frutti di mare, and one got a lobster ravioli.  The lamb ragu was good, but a touch too salty, and definitely NOT $35 quality.  I could probably make something similar at home.  The lobster ravioli- it was so bad that my friend had the rest of us taste it just to experience how bad it was.  It had like 0.01 ounce of stringy, fishy lobster in it and was somehow bland and over-salted at the same time.  The manager was nice enough to take it off our bill.  My friend who had the frutti de mare seemed to love his entree.  Sadly, he was the only one.  . . 4).  We had a late dinner reservation - 10pm.  Obviously they were not busy.  Somehow the meal still took 3 HOURS.  How? Why? . . Probably the only better-than-meh part of this meal of the steak tar tar that my friend got as an appetizer.  It was delicious.  It was the quality of food one would expect to get while paying these prices. . . In summary, either Mario Batali has never set foot in this restaurant, or he doesn't deserve to be an Iron Chef.
It takes the cured pork fat and rubs it all over its body.  One of the best meals of my life apart from the slow wait staff.
It has been a few years but the food was very good. I had the untrimmed lamb chops. Great! There is a lot of competition and there was nothing they offered that really makes you want to return. The four stars is for the lamb chops.
Attention Meat Eaters!. . First, logistics: FULL MENU AT THE BAR unlike many of the competing steakhouses in town. This makes it inexcusable for you to miss thisplace. No reservations--just plop down at the bar and go to town.. . It saddens me to think that a meat lover would visit Vegas and not get an opportunity to try the riserva because they read some ridiculous reviews on Yelp. I was almost one of those people. I was even afraid after realizing how easy it was to get reservations here compared to other places which were full. But I listened to my gut and it didn't fail me. And since you don't need reservations at the bar, if you are in town more than a couple of days, just swing by every night to see if the riserva is available.. . Cut and CraftSteak are frequently mentioned as having the best steak in town. I've never been so I won't even doubt that the overall experience and service is better. However, when in the land of excess, do something you cannot do elsewhere. I can eat imported Japanese wagyu where I live or buy 3-5 week dry aged or prime beef, give it a lovely smokiness with oak or hickory and make it taste as good as many steakhouses. But can you eat 280 day dry aged beef (the age on my visit) anywhere in this country??? No!. . Some do not like the taste of dry aged meat. If you are one of those people, then your money is probably better spent at some other restaurant. BUT, if you are one of those that like the nuttiness and funkiness then come here. I repeat: you cannot get this kind of meat anywhere else in this country. I repeat: you can get basically the same cut of meat from almost any other restaurant at home. Most of these guys get their meat from Allen Brothers, Lobel, Pat Lafrieda or DeBragga. As an aside, the Miyazaki filet from DeBragga online is the 2nd best steak I've ever had. The riserva was #1.. . Their regular steaks I believe are aged 60-90 days, twice the standard time. I do want to come back to see if this is noticeably different from a shorter time. Usually the funkiness really starts developing after  4-5 weeks.. . I was here a couple of weeks ago on a Monday. I sat at the bar like I usually do. I was alone. This removes a lot of the problems with service that invariably occur. I got there around 7:30 pm. I asked if they had they had the riserva and I lucked out. Vegas baby!. . Bartender also recommended the grilled octopus. I grew up eating octopus but in my later years didn't really enjoy it as much. Having said that, get this! Delicious. These are big chunks, meaty, tasty, not chewy at all, lovely texture and in some type of sweet balsamic reduction ... or something like that. Anyway, so good. Went well with my Negroni and vieux carre.. . As for the steak? Freaking amazing. Got 1 inch worth which was maybe 12 oz of actual meat. This was more than enough. The meat is so heavy (not gristly fatty but an "oily" fatty) that you can't eat that much. Two could easily share the riserva ribeye but of course as a man, I ate it alone. Amazing. Best steak ever. Yes, it could have used a tiny bit more salt but the meat was the star. Not as funky and cheesy as I thought it would be but still more than your average steak. Very tender. Got mine medium rare and it was fantastic.. . For those complaining about prices, this is the strip. Everything is overpriced. You want overpriced? Go to some of the other places and pay $34 per OUNCE of Japanese wagyu when you can get it back home for $20/ounce or buy it for $12.50. It's the same stuff you can get from DeBragga. But $108/inch cut of 280 day dry aged beef? Totally worth it.
People who dis this place are trying to come off as big foodie kings whose palates are refined and above reproach and know everything there is to know and by giving this place a bad revue they feel self possessed. Sorry but if you are from Fresno or  Henderson or Tucson or some other such low brow place.....please, your image seeking nonsense is so transparent you should be embarrassed.....LOL!  I have lived all over the world and have only been to 4 restaurants in my life where the dining experience was so amazing as to render in unforgettable. Two of them were in Italy, one of them is in Seattle, and the other was Carnevino. I went for Christmas Eve. Feast of Seven Fishes. There are no words. Absolutely exquisite!
I grew up in NYC and have been to some of the best steak houses and this is absolutely terrible!  Do not waste your money.  I am local now and would NEVER go back.  We don't always go to the strip anyway but we are sure we will not be back to this restaurant.   The service was just deplorable. The hostess station was surrounded by women that looked like they came off the street downtown.  They looked beat up and high.  They were rude and had no idea how to greet guests.  They looked bored and uninterested to be there.  The customer service they represented was awful. We had reservations and although we showed up very well dressed we were put in some closet type room off the main dining.  It was as if they were hiding the misfit toys in there and we ended up there too.  Very embarrassing considering our out of town guest is quite wealthy and is used to being treated very well when he frequents restaurants.  Our waiter bumped our guest several times during the service and my guest was just appalled.  The food was terrible.  We ordered steaks and although our waiter said we would not be able to finish the food we walked out hungry.  Hungry after a steak house meal?  That is an oxymoron that is exactly what happened here.  We are very fit people.  We are not all you can eat diners. ( Just to give you an idea of how small the portions were)  My husband and guest had picked wine and when they finished the bottle they were told that the same bottle was not available.  That is not a tragedy but where is the knowledge of the restaurants inventory.  That is not acceptable.  Mario Batali should be embarrassed with how his restaurant is being run.  Maybe he needs to go back behind the scenes and reevaluate who is better at being his GM. When you spend over six hundred dollars for three people you expect so much more.  Shame on me for being sucked into a Vegas tourist trap.  Just be smart about where you land on the strip for diner and avoid this place at all costs. I don't know where the good reviews are coming from.  Either it is the employees trying there best to keep people coming or it is people who have no clue what a good steakhouse is.
I dined with my two friends last saturday night (April 5th). I wish I could give it 10 stars! The haters, really? I was just there! Best restaurant and experience I've had in Vegas ever! The service was phenomenal and so accommodating.  It was so amazing and I am a foodie! Everything is Italian coursed so you get to try a lot of things. Also the drinks were fabulous! We all started with a blood orange cosmo. It was so fresh and delicious!. . We got the octopus to start. It was the best octopus I have ever had! You could use a fork to cut it and that is saying something. It was the most well cooked octopus I have ever had. The sauce was acidic with notes of salt and sweetness. Perfect balance. . . Then we had the bucatini all'amatriciana, I previously had this had his restaurant Otto and it was delicious! The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente and you have pieces of onion and guanciale running through it. My favorite part was the slight heat in the background from fresco chili peppers.. . Last but not least we had the dry-aged bone in rib eye and split it between 3 of us. The presentation was fabulous! It was table side and she cut it to perfection. To top it off, they drizzled extra virgin olive oil over it. Also you can eat off the bone and they encourage it lol! The sides we chose were the mascarpone mashed potatoes and the sauteed spinach. These were the best potatoes I've had. They are laced with mascarpone and come in a little cast iron skillet. To top it off, there is a poached egg that is mixed with it, AMAZING! The sauteed spinach has a hint of chili and garlic in it.. . We were too full for dessert, but each had a glass of fresh limoncello. It was refreshing, but strong! That will put hair on your chest lol. Overall we had a fabulous dinner and danced the night away after. I don't know where you all have been eating, but this was something to brag about.
I HIGHLY do not recommend your money at this place because it is a waste of money. The food is undercooked and is OVERLY over priced. It's my first time here, and I will wouldn't recommend to come here. But everybody had their own opinion.
porterhouse for 2...nuff said....
Great food- we had a variety of steaks and appetizers, desserts and it was flawless.  Sharing the ribeye and others for a party of 7 was perfect - would highly recommend
We all can do better than this place!!. . This is an example of tourists who are very excited, and want to tell everyone they ate at Mario Batali's Restaurant, and don't realize they are being taken for more than they were in the Casino. . . My son and I went to meet my sister and my niece, who were visiting here, and choose the place. . . Unfortunately, this place is very typical of eateries in the Palazzo-Venetian Complex. Rude and arrogant staff, mediocre quality, and over priced. . . When my son and I complained that the portions were small, and the food wasn't that good, my niece came to the place's defense and said, "It's owned by Mario Bateli.". . That doesn't make the food or the errogence of the staff better. And as my fellow reviewer, Jamie C said, "very overpriced". . . If you're into the Celebrity Chef scene and want to brag to your friends, I suppose it's better to throw out your money away on this place than the tables.
We were very excited to have dinner at Carnevino. Our excitement quickly turned into disappointment. We are not opposed to spending $300 for a dinner for two. However, our meal was anything but fantastic. . We started with a mushroom pasta dish, Tagliatelle, which was the best dish we had at Carvino. From there it was all down hill. Me and my husband had the La Forentina, bone in Porterhouse for two. It was flavorless and not worth $160.00. We have had better steak at Flemings, CraftSteak and Outback Steakhouse. The sides we ordered were wedge fries and asparagus and they were nothing to write home about. The entire dinner left us feeling empty and robbed. . If you don't like loud obnoxious metal music while eating dinner , then you will not like this place.. Sorry, but this restaurant is a WOLF in SHEEPS's clothing. We recommend going somewhere else. We will next time we are in Vegas.
