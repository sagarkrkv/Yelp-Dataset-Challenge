The BEST chicken and waffles EVER!!!! Portion and prices are AMAZING! This place is a MUST! in Vegas.
This place was so amazing that I literally blew a kiss to it as I walked away!  I went on a referral from a friend and it was well worth their advice!  Immediately the service was spot on with a server who wasn't only extremely helpful but witty as well.  I ordered the Kokamo sandwich and it was huge! Everything was top notch:  service, taste, portion size, ambiance... you name it!
I had high expectations hence a one star rather than two. Our 25 minute wait did not effect my low rating. We should all expect a wait for breakfast on the weekend.. I had the meatloaf, egg and potatoes meal.  The meatloaf was so dry I almost dosed it with ketchup and I hate ketchup. . Some times it's the little things that set you off.  Biscuits.  We had a choice of rye or wheat bread a biscuit.  Being a die hard sourdough guy I took the biscuit.  Our server did not bring butter, jam or honey and did not ask if we would like any.  My brain usually kicks in about the time a server has just left, but on this occasion I asked after not being offered anything.  Butter and jam where brought back to the table.  No choice of what kind of jam I would prefer.  No mention of honey maybe being available.. My requested over medium eggs were of course over easy - nobody gets that right.  The potatoes not very memorable.. . So high expectations added to by the crowd of people waiting for a table and a plate with awful meatloaf add up to a ONE STAR I don't know how anybody could call this amazing and I am not inclined to give them a second chance.  Enough
Quantity= bang for your buck. Quality= eh, better than buffet but not as good as specialized places, like Metro Pizza or Naked City or Bachi Burger.
My food was very bland. I ordered the house salad with chicken. It came with a giant biscuit. The salad had some kind of pesto dressing on it that didn't taste like a much. Overall a disappointing experience, I probably would not recommend this place.
I've been to Hash House several times, and to to this particular location three times.  The service and food is always on point.  I tend to get the same thing, ham and spinach scramble with a s'mores mocha so I highly recommend both of those items.  My husband has had different dish every time and enjoyed them all.  The portions are huge, the bloody mary's are strong, the servers are friendly - what else could you ask for?
FAB-U-LOUS!!   What a great place.  Worth the wait in line.  Hit the one @ the Rio which was packed but that usually say's alot about a place.  Ordered the Corned Beef Hash with eggs and it was The BEST I've ever had.  That's saying alot since mine is pretty darned good.  They take pride in their food.  I have nothing bad to say, great food, great service!
For breakfast only I like this place.  . Service is never very fast and you get obscene amounts of food.  . But its definitely an experience and easy to have a slow meal with friends when you're not on a time table.. . Love their biscuits and bacon.  Would be happier with the fruit plate if they'd stop serving it with obviously frozen blueberries.
Much like ihop in pricing but be weary of sides they are $3 each. . Food is delightful. much better than ihop.
Oh man, this place is just heaven. The food is so good. HUGE portions which is nice and makes for literally 3-4 meals and I LOVE leftovers!
My friends and I went out to Vegas to celebrate my 21st birthday and by the end of the weekend we were craving some really good food. I mean who doesn't crave really good food after a weekend of being in Vegas. This place is worth the 45 minute wait we endured. The service was very friendly and we got our orders in quickly and then they came out about 7 minutes later. The portions are well worth the money and then some. Please give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed.
The portions are absolutely enormous, so split an entree. Presentation was moderately creative, the food was fairly good (shared the fried salmon entree), but my house salad was the lamest thing ever. Way too much day-old iceberg lettuce, and not enough of the other vegetables (so order a different salad). Not a good place to go if you are looking for something light and healthy.
Fun place to enjoy a meal.  Great menu . . . . Great prices.
Food is amazing! Service could be friendly and the wait was really long but that is just because they are so popular that they are really busy on the weekends.
This place was SO yummy.  I can't wait to go back and try it again!
A must place to eat if you are here in Vegas. A bit of a drive off the strip but so worth it! My chorizo hash was just spicy enough with great flavor. This plate is so big you can easily split it w someone.  Comes w your choice of egg biscuit and fruit. Sooooo good!!!
There are not enough great breakfast/brunch places in Vegas, but Hash House A Go Go makes up for that lack. I order something different every time I go, and I have never been disappointed. Simply. Great.
Too much food and not  tasty!,
Delicious. Huge portions. Drinks are pleasant. Staff is very friendly and helpful. BE READY for any dish, I wasn't hungry until the next morning. So worth it though! Advice; go in as a party of 4,order 2 dishes, 4 drinks,and tip well!
Awesome food large portions!!! Won't leave hungry...a must stop when you come to Vegas!!!
Never disappoints. Big portions, tasty food. The wait can be long at times but always worth it.
While visiting Vegas, we decided to give their chicken & waffles a try. While waiting to be seated we could see the HUGE portions. My husband was disappointed that their chix n waffles only came with chix breast. He decided to only get a bacon waffle & try some of my chix. When the food arrived it looked incredible, but the chix was bland & lacked flavor. The waffles we ok but nothing great.. . I'm not sure if we would go back next time we visit Vegas.
If you are looking for a great place and want to get off the strip for a bit this is a fun place to take the family.  It is great for larger parties and kids. The staff was very friendly and accommodated our group of 8 with 4 of those being kids.  . The portions are crazy big, but as some places with huge portions they like on quality, this is not the case there.  The quantity and quality are both done well.  I was able to order one dish and share with my 2 kids and there was plenty to go around.  . This is not a place to hit up if you are looking for a light meal, but more a splurge to indulge while on vacation.
The food is great but wow is a lot of food! lol
Oh my goodness! Great food and LOTS of it! You won't go away hungry, that's for sure! A must eat while in Vegas!
Great food..great service....great decor....very pleased with the sage fried chicken and bacon waffles..the best..
Doogie Howser signed his photo here "Snicker's Bar panckaes, Yum!", so that's what I ordered. Boy, they were good. HUGE, fluffy buttermilk pancakes that covered the entire oversized plate, with melty chunks of Snicker's candy bar generously laced throughout. I never imagined that a Snicker's bar would taste delicious with maple syrup on it, but, it does! My other half had the obsecenely enormous I Don't Know What It Was plate that he saw Adam Richmond eat on Man V Food. It was piled to the ceiling with a conglomeration of sage chicken, biscuits and gravy, eggs, potatoes, bacon and god knows what else. I never saw anything like it. He loved it. Usually he can and does eat everything on his plate, but nothing doing this time. Even he could not take it down. He was bested by several other big, arm tatted dudes straight from the set of Pawn Stars who I witnessed level the thing in under 30 minutes. It was brunch and entertainment. Loved the fun industrial strength decor with corn silo beverage tower. We are going back tomorrow.
Management very unaccommodating to customer requests. Couldn't get a pancake a la carte without paying the full price of the menu item? Will not be returning to this establishment and will encourage others not to as well.
I wanted to love this place, but I can't. It's just too much of a grease overload without any balance. The portions are the only thing good about this place. Everything else was just too much. I tried the salmon benedict, chicken and waffles, and the chicken benedict, After a couple of bites out of all...you just want to stop.. . I was longing for something EXTRA SPICY after all that and we even togo'ed the rest of the food and never touched it again. Pretty sad that such a great place was not worth it in my eyes.
Great food, but terrible service! Called them to alert them that we would be arriving with a large group of 10 of us at 10 am on a Friday morning. Were told that they only take reservations with 24 hours notice. Got there around 9:45 and was told there would be a 40 min wait. No biggie, I thought. I noticed as we were standing outside, patiently waiting our 40 minutes, there was a large, empty table that was set for 12 out on the patio. I went in and asked the hostess if we could sit at this table outside and was told that there were 2 other large groups ahead of us. Again, not a big deal. At the 30 min mark, we were surprised when we were told our table was ready!  YEA! 10 minutes early.  My excitement faded when we were lead straight to the empty table outside we had been staring at for the past 30 minutes!  ARGH!  How frustrating!!  This was our second visit this year to this place and a similar situation happened on our first visit..they had half the place empty but a long wait time?  I don't think they know how to manage their staff very well.  . We waited for about 10 min before our waiter (who turned out to be the bartender from inside) came to get out order. He said he was there to take our drink order and I told him we were all ready to order food as well.  I was told "lets get the drinks out of the way and I will beback for the food orders after"  We all ordered our drink and I was impressed he didn't write a THING down! Needless to say, our drink order was screwed up. When he came back to take our food order, he wrote it all down this time, but was almost rude as he did so. After about 15 minutes our food arrived. One, plate,  and one person,at, a, time. First the bacon, then the eggs..etc.  it was painful to experience.  We of course waited until the last person was served to start eating and by then the first couple of people's food was cold. No one came to check on us during our breakfast and we had to hunt down our waiter to get the check which took another 10 minutes. Again, the food is awesome and the portions are ridiculously huge but the service is worse than anything.  PS: The "sound system" on the outdoor patio sounds like it was coming from a cell phone. TERRIBLE quality.
It's is worth the wait. It's always a long wait because people will wait for good food and good service. If you are trying to shed a few pounds, stay clear from this awesomeness of food place.
First off just the food was amazing my family came up to visit me for easter weekend. . . Chicken and waffles OMFG. I could suggest more syrup if the portion's that mondo then just a ramekin size of  syrup will not do it justest. The chicken part extremely moist not dry breading very light and falls off and the waffles had a nice texture maybe a suggestion of powdered sugar on top to make cool looking. . . group had also fried green tomatoes witch was so dam good that had a chicken something mix on it. The mix was really good however my concern if your vegetarian well obiv not eating at this place that they should mention chicken part on menu maybe they did however I might of missed it but was really great. . . The staff seemed to like there job our server was great even the busser's who brought out food where friendly. The server continually asked us if we needed re fills on drinks and seemed not to mind when we asked for coffee, she said let me check and I guessed made a new one with out seeming bothered or traumatized for making us some. . . The music volume is kinda loud even for my taste, however service and food made up for it. . . Professional staff that makes eating out fun..   . . Group of 4 guest $95 bill but large portions.
About a thirty minute wait but mostly due to it being a Sunday morning I bet. I'm not sure why they don't hand out the "your table is ready" electronic notifier disc things...because of that you end up standing around outside the door so you don't miss the verbal call of your name. In the heat and limited waiting seating, that can be a bit of a drag. Once inside you'll find the meals are massive. I had the meatloaf hash, it was really good and filling. Service a bit slow, had to wait a while for coffee refills. A definite stop though!
This place is delicious !  Great family place and not too expensive. The plates are huge also so you definitely get what you pay for. Service was good! although it was a bit packed and had to wait 15 min to be seated but it was well worth the wait!
Great food if you have an enormous appetite!
Well if you starving this is the place to....the portions are huge! I had the mushroom swiss burger and couldnt finish. All the burgers have 1lb of meat. The taste and presentation of the burgers were good, not the best in the world like what was shown on Man Vs Food, but good. I came a second time to try the Sage Chicken and Waffles. Again huge portions, and very tatsy.
Here from Madison, WI and will be talking about this place for a long time. Portions are huge and delicious. Excellent quality. Food presentation is wonderful. Food was served quickly. Our waitress was so sweet.
Well, what can I say that hasn't been said in over 2000 reviews? Maybe I'll just echo what's been already said. The food is awesome, portions huge, and atmosphere pretty good.. . I guess I'll keep it short and sweet.
SO Heavenly! Loved our waiter. Loved the food. The experience was amazing. We are coming back EVERY time we come to Vegas!!!
Outstanding food. Service could use some work. Had a wobbly table. I wish they had a bigger lunch menu.
This is my favorite place for brunch!!! I've taken several of my friends here and they love it too!! My favorite dish is the Chorizo Hash!! I can't describe how amazing it is!! The cocktails are delish too!! My favorite is the Orange Crush!! Boy oh Boy is it good!! I can't get enough of this place!!
best food and biggest portions in las vegas
When I am not dieting or when we have out-of-town visitors, we always bring them to Hash House a Go Go.  This place is the perfect place to go to for brunch or lunch.  Its always busy but I never had to wait for more than 20 minutes.. . Basically, everything is good and there's  A LOT of food!  My favorites are:. . - Chicken and waffles (good white meat). - French Toast. - Sounds ridiculous, but the coffee is solid here.
Average taste, huge portions
Living in Vegas for all these years, it was time to finally come here. They used to have a location at the M, but they closed down so we made the shlep across town in the hopes of experiencing a Vegas icon.. Sunday lunch time and line was out the door with the promise of seating after a 45 minute wait. We waited in the car since there wasn't much wait seating. Ok, busy place is always a good sign of good food, right? Well, maybe it's more about the GINORMOUS portions.. As you can already tell from the 2 stars, I was not at all impressed. However, I must give props to the friendly and cordial service we received from our server.. Clientele that day was mostly tatted up hipster crowd with piercings and stretched out lobes. To each their own.. We ordered a spicy Bloody Mary that was very good and perfect for a Sunday afternoon.. We've been on a fried chicken & waffles kick as of late and eager to try the sage chicken & waffles. The pictures of it show a tower of chicken stacked high on a huge plate. We thought sharing this enormous entree would be the best option.. We were amused at the nearby table of 3 petite diners, each having their own tower of chicken & waffles. How ambitious.. We finally got ours and though the presentation looked impressive...it was a huge disappointment.. The chicken was soggy and skin was wet and fatty. The overall flavor of the sage and rosemary mixed into the batter was awful. We both choked down a couple bites but hated it. The waffle was ok with the bacon cooked into it, but not enough the redeem this nasty dish. This was the only thing on the menu that made Hash House a remote possibility for us, but after this experience we will definitely not return.
At the suggestion of some local friends we went to breakfast at Hash House A Go Go and it was as advertised.  Very large portions of very good food.  The bacon was thick, eggs cooked perfectly to order and my French Toast was to die for.  I highly recommend this place.  The only rub is that it is busy so be prepared to wait.
I don't remember what I have had here besides the chicken and waffle. I remember big portions and the food was ok, I would come back but not crazy delicious flavors. Super big portions though their hot chocolates were really tasty though. I want to check out the one in Rio.
