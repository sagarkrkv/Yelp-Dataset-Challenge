Not the best Cirque du Soleil show. It was actually disappointing, I don't believe the best Beatles songs were chosen. Some of the songs I had never even heard of. I honestly believe the best part was the beginning. Hardly any acrobat acts and the little that they did perform, I had seen at other shows and were performed better.  Too expensive and not worth it.
First Cirque du Soleil and it was free...there are no bad seats just an amazing performance!!!
I saw this show a few years ago and it was not my favorite. You would have to be a real jerk to give this show a bad review so I will give it 5 stars just like all the others. 5 stars because the music is amazing and the functionality of the stage and props not to mention the performers are again amazing. I have seen La Nouba, Love, Mystere, Zumanity, Totem and O. In the Vegas area I think Zumanity is my favorite and when it comes to the traveling shows I really liked Totem .
Out of all the Cirque shows I've ever been to, this is my favorite and I'm really not that huge if a Beatles music fan.. . I love how the stage is in a round so every person truly has a great view. . . The acrobatics were amazing and stunning visually. Not to give out any spoilers, the set is awesome. . . I agree in that this show is great for families and couples alike. Truly an enjoyable experience.
If you like the Beatles, stop, you'll love this.  If you like Cirque Du Soleil, stop, you'll love it.  If you can see can remember anything from the 60's, stop, you'll flash back!. It's a multimedia production using the music of the Beatles as the thread to move acrobatics, costumes, light and video thru your eyes.  To bad this ain't Colorado or Washington!  Lol. Very Psychedelic ! . Remember to allow time to pick up your tickets from Will Call, at least an hour before.  We were able to grab a snack at California Pizza Kitchens in The Mirage with less than an hour before show time.   . Love, love, love!. Next, I'd like to see a "Rolling Stones" Cirque Du Soleil.  Why not?
This was the best performance I've ever seen. It set the bar so high. If you like the Beatles or not you are going to love this show. The only people that don't like this show are miserable people.
Finally got to see this show. The music was good. The performers were good. They get the crowd involved. But if I had choice to see the Beetles or Michael Jackson show I wouldMJ!!!
MY FIRST CIRQUE DU SOLEIL & LAS VEGAS SHOW. . Growing up I wasn't a Beatles fan. That changed several years ago when I saw VH1's Greatest 100 Rock & Roll Albums. I noticed that five of the Beatles' albums were in the Top 11 (#1 Revolver, #6 Rubber Soul, #8 Abbey Road, #10 Sgt. Pepper, #11 White Album). Surprisingly Chuck D of Public Enemy said his favorite Beatles' album is Revolver. He also said what makes a great album is that not every song is a hit song. When I started listening to those albums I understood what he was saying. What made the Beatles great wasn't that they wrote great songs, but they created great albums, which is considered a lost art in today's music.. . I didn't know what to expect from this show. I've never seen a Las Vegas show before. My boss saw this show a few years back and didn't like it. I haven't seen any Cirque du Soleil show but I wasn't sure if I would like the theatrics from the show. Also I wasn't sure if contemporary dance will be performed. Being someone who's fan of hip hop dance I'm not particular fond of contemporary dance. Also I heard there was montage or collage of Beatles' songs meaning a whole song will not be fully played. I set myself for low expectations.. . After watching the show I was blown away. Without detailing every song or moves, for those who are interested in watching the show, I will depict the highlights. I love the mood in the opening scene of Liverpool in WWII. For the song "I am the Walrus" there were some hip hop and b-boy moves. In sense I was shocked for this show to see a lot more b-boy moves like lock and pop as I assume the dance form for this show would be contemporary dance. Even though I'm not a fan of contemporary dance for the song "Something" there were b-boy moves yet the emotion felt through the dance moves had a contemporary dance vibe to it. If I had to summarize the choreography of the whole show there were mixtures of hip hop and b-boy moves yet there was an emotional contemporary dance feeling to it.. . In terms of acrobatics there was guy on a swing that was raised high in the roof. The acrobatics he did without a cable and safety net astonished me. If you're afraid of heights you will be aghast what he was doing. I'll be honest for those who are interested in more Cirque du Soleil acrobatics this show doesn't have a lot of them. This show is more about the choreography through Beatles songs. What is amazing is that the later Beatles' songs weren't meant for dancing in clubs like today's music. Their songs had pure emotion. What makes this show entertaining is the choreography telling a story through The Beatles' songs. . . I've performed in several hip hop showcases. The reason I was blown away after watching this show is seeing the timing of the choreography of this show amazes me because I know how much the time these dancers put in. To get the timing and sequence right, if done correctly, makes the show entertaining. That takes a lot of practice. . . You know are enjoying a show when you don't have to look at your watch to hope and see when the show will end. Never once had I looked at my watch while I was watching this show. . . Picking a Cirque du Soleil show can be difficult. I recommend picking a theme that interests you. If you love the Beatles then you will love this show.
First off, I asked for aisle seats live and in person at the box office. When we arrived, we found that we were indeed at the end of a row, but not an aisle.  We had to climb over 12 people to get to our seats, which made it very uncomfortable when we walked out in the middle of the performance.... very boring.. . Every seat in this theater-in-the-round has partially obstructed views. . Do not get me wrong, the acrobats are very talented and I am a big fan of Mystere, O and KA, but even the failed Elvis show was better than this.. . Do not waste your money!
outstanding! i loved everything about this show. it was my first cirque show and i was beyond impressed! the acrobatics, the dancing, the music, it left me loving the beatles even more than before. the stage is round so there really isn't a bad seat, no matter where you are you can see everything. the show was just fantastic!
Not knowing to much about The Beatles I still enjoyed the show a lot! I knew more songs than I thought I did that's for sure! The dancers are amazing, singing and dancing also the production of the entire show from beginning to end.
Worst. Show. Ever.. . Maybe if you drop acid before the performance it's awesome. But I found that other than the opening scene, the acts were either way too busy or slow and boring. And I can't tell you why they named it "Love."  . . This show isn't worth your time.
Awesome show!  The theater is round, so there honestly are not any "bad seats".  We love the Beatles, so the music and dancing were fabulous!  Compared to other Cirque du Soleil shows, there are less acrobatic tricks.  It didn't really bother us, but something to consider if you only have time for one show.
Holy cow! Beatles' LOVE Cirque show is hands down the best show I've seen! Visually breath-taking, stylistically surreal, beautifully choreographed and designed, powerful symbols and theme, etc. Haha couldn't help but sing along to the Beatles songs I did know lol. Love it and highly recommend it. 5 out of 5 stars easy!
Seen Beatles LOVE twice, first time I was sober, second time I was um do I need to elaborate? I preferred the sober show. . . Ever since I was a tween I absolutely loved the Beatles, When I saw this show was in Vegas I knew I had to check it out. . . The 200 Sections are a great view for the price, Beatles love sometimes has a 50% OFF promo via online, that's the best time to grab some tickets. . . Price: Level 3 I paid $88.00 for section 203, row N Seat 1 . . Oh my goodness the male contortionist with 100 abs got me all hot, Ugh just him alone is worthy of 5 stars. . . The music, Props, Dancing and Acrobatics were entertaining and kept my interest the entire time! I found myself singing along the entire time. . . This show is like a story, I can dig that, If you can appreciate music videos I think you will love this show but if your looking for acrobatics the entire show then look elsewhere.. . Oh Vegas please bring me Cirque du Soleil Dark Side Of The Moon . that would make my year!!!.  . RANDOM FACT:. The first lyrics to "Yesterday" were "scrambled eggs."
Ended up catching this show because O just happened to be blacked out when I was visiting Vegas. Boy, am I glad I was forced to choose LOVE instead.. . My seat was section209 P10. After much research, I've found that you don't necessarily want to sit in the front most row. There are some things that happen during the show, and my seat was almost perfect to get both views at a point where you will only get one point of view. Actually, I would even recommend one row lower, the O row, or one even lower than that in either section 209 or 200. There is a grayed out box in section 209 - don't worry about that. It's a soundbox or something and it will not obstruct your view at all. If the show faces any side at all, I would say its the 209 or 200 section. I got a 25% off online offer and got these tickets at $125. . . The set designs were seriously impressive. I am amazed at how they creatively figured out ways to make a huge visual impact. There were moments where I blurted out "wow" because it was just that cool. . . The show isn't so much about acrobatics like the other Cirque shows. It's more about dancing, the mood, and the creative production pieces. If you appreciate production design, you will enjoy this show. . . Don't worry if you aren't a huge Beatles fan - I like them, but not religiously. It was still very enjoyable. . . It's honestly one of the best things I've ever seen!!
