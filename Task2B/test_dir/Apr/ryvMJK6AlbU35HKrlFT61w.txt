I loved Texas de Brazil, Las Vegas. The staff was friendly, food and drinks delicious! The salad bar had a variety of choices and the meats melted in my mouth. The sangria was very good. Even though I enjoyed my dining experience, I had to give it 2 stars because I had a Bridesmaids moment. It was really bad! If you've seen the movie Bridesmaids, you'll understand.
Came here for a client dinner at the clients request.  The salad bar is top notch,  The meat was all very good, but a bit salty for my liking.  I went home with a really bad belly ache and later substantial gastrointestinal distress.  I woke up and decided to become vegetarian.  . . Unless meat is totally your thing, avoid this place.
Went to Texas De Brazil Steakhouse for dinner for the first time and it was such wonderful experience  . Although I dont eat meat, they have an amazing salad bar with sushi & shrimp & salmon ( which I do eat :) ) grilled veggies and cheeses and more ; just delicious  . Definitely I recomend it ; especially Richard he was such an attentive and awesome waiter . The gauchos walk around going from table to table serving you meat. The whole experience was just amazing!!!
We love this restaurant. The service is great and the food is amazing. The salad bar is a meal in itself and you can do it as the light meal. But, when meat starts rolling through the light meal goes out the window.
Had my 30th bday party here last October 2013. We had a party of 14 and reservations were made and were treated and sat accordingly. Food was amazing. This would be my 5th Brazilian steakhouse experience and it would rank 2nd behind greenfield in Long Beach,Ca. They have brisket :)   But this place is a close 2nd. The filet was great along with the skirt steak. The only reason I removed stars is because they would not allow us to eat my girlfriends homemade birthday cupcakes that we brought through tsa and multiple cab rides just to get them to the dinner table . They wanted to charge us a $4 per person for a dessert serving fee even they would not be serving it. I understand bringing your own dessert losses revenue but we just spent $800 at your restaurant, exceptions could have been made. I even went to the mgr but he explained the same thing as the waiter I asked. Other then that, the food and experience made the birthday dinner great. I would return, but not on my birthday. ;)
Our staff had their appreciation dinner here and enjoyed it very much.  Food was great.  It was a little difficult to have long conversations however when the servers kept interrupting with the meat choices.  All in all was very good.
We frequent this place often for special occasions. I've brought our staff and their spouses for dinner in the private glass room and it was an amazing time together. It's inexpensive when you buy the VIP dining card and it shows your employees value. Sign up on their email list and get 2 for 1 coupons for your birthday and anniversary. The food is amazing (although some of the meats were salty for my taste because I don't usually cook with salt), the salad bar is way better than Pampas, the mash potatoes help absorb/neutralize the salt, the fried bananas were awesome enough to be dessert. Great place but don't come here if you're looking for a quiet romantic dinner because it's LOUD, really NOISY, and full of life.  Uninterrupted conversations are difficult because the servers keep coming to your table with meat along with your table server with water and accompaniments. I would have given it 5-stars but because of the noise factor and frequent interruption it was hard to enjoy conversations. If you go for the quality of the food you won't be disappointed, but if you go for quality of conversation you might get frustrated. Anyways, we will return for the great service and quality of food.
We received a gift card for Texas de Brazil and decided to use it last night, Saturday April 13, 2004.  First, I would strongly recommend making a reservation.  The two times I've come to this location the restaurant has been very busy.  . . The setup for food in the restaurant is a single price for your meal.  You have access to a large salad bar, which has many options besides just salad.  There is shrimp salad, couscous, cucumber salad, salmon, meats and cheeses like you would have in antipasto, asparagus, sugar snap peas, hearts of palm, green beans, and many other items. Everything we tried we enjoyed.  My favorite items on the salad bar were the cucumber salad and the green beans.  In addition to the salad bar, your meal comes with garlic mashed potatoes (fan-tas-tic!), a basket of cheese bread rolls (again, fan-tas-tic!), and sweet fried plantains (I've been told you are supposed to eat a bite of these to clear the palate). . . The meats are brought around to the table on skewers and offered in small individual portions.  You can take as much as you want.  There's chicken, shank steak, filet mignon, bacon wrapped filet mignon, sirloin, pork loin, lamb chops, sausage, and a number of others.  The filet mignon and the pork loin were my favorites.  So very flavorful, moist, and savory.  . . We didn't have the room for dessert, but on my first visit I had the chocolate cake, which was definitely worth making extra room for.. . A couple of things to note if you've never been to the restaurant.  The signature alcoholic beverage The Caipirinha is very strong.  If you do not like the taste of alcohol I would recommend avoiding the drink.  Although it does taste good, the alcohol is very potent.  Also, be aware that you are not allowed to take home any of the food you do not eat, so ensure that you only get what you can eat.. . I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  The meats are very well flavored and cooked.  The setup is different any enjoyable.  The atmosphere is very comfortable and would make a great place for a romantic date.
I was 50/50 between Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil but I'm going to say I like Texas de Brazil slightly more than Fogo de Chao their salad bar is much bigger and has way more to choose from so delicious. And the meat TDF!. . #TIP if not big on all kinds of meats.  I was 90% full with the great stuff at salad bar...saves ya at leas 20 25 on bill... I still got some meats but boy I was in a food coma after that lol
OMG meat heaven! I don't even care that this place is a chain, because this place is top notch. I highly recommend a reservation because this place can get busy, and who wants to wait for their unlimited meat-fest Brazilian style? . . Your Brazilian adventure is broken up into two parts: the buffet and the meat. Their dinner buffet has a ton of things from salad to salami to sushi, to lobster bisque. You could literally fill yourself up on the buffet alone. But you are going to want to try one of everything that the servers walk by with delicious meats from lamb to chicken to filet. You can pick what kind of cut you want, from medium to well done and they slice it off for you. My personal favorites are the leg of lamb and filet. Plus the best part is that you can say no to everything and yes to only the type of meat you want. And you can eat until you explode!. . It is worth noting that they have a generous military discount. The service is always top notch, and the ambiance is just perfect. I only come here for special occasions since it can be pricey, but it is worth every penny. I have been to a few Brazilian Steakhouses, and this is by far the best one.
This place was delicious. I enjoyed every meat I tried and all the side dishes were fantastic as well. Even if I didn't eat meat I would have been satisfied with the large selection of appetizers, salads and soups. Definitely making a trip back here.
I'm still a fan of Texas De Brazil but after lunch there today, I was pretty insulted when my check arrived and the recommended gratuity (you know, 15% is this much, 18% and so on...) at the bottom of the check was circled.  Plus the gratuity wasn't even accurate because kids were half-priced and the gratuity included them as full priced. Las Vegas is full of people who work in the hospitality business and I usually leave 30% but after being insulted and forced to look at the recommended gratuity, I just left 20.  Management needs to tell their servers to stop begging for tips.  Good service ensures good tips.
I wasn't too impressed with the meat here. It seems that all the brazilian bbq places I've gone to over the last 5 years have progressively gotten worse in their quality. It's either too dry, or too salty. Maybe the meat isn't so good. . . My fave cut is usually the Picanha. I wasn't too impressed. . . I think my fave item was the quinoa salad (i know, i know), and the cheese. Service was good, and the place is ginormous. I'm not sure if I'll go back if I had a choice.
*This is an afte review edit. I woke up after eating  here feeling so sick. I've been throwing up all morning. Not cool.  *. . I took my dad and roommate here for my last night in Las Vegas. They loved it. The staff was friendly and helpful. The meat was delicious, my only complaint was it was a little too salty. I love the salad bar as the lobster bisque is very yummy. It's like butter in your mouth. The mashed potatoes they give you with the meat is so smooth and full of flavor. I was the only one who ate it as the boys preferred more meat instead of potatoes. :) more for me! My only suggestion is to not fill up at the salad bar so you have plenty of room for meat! We also somehow had room for dessert, our second stomach opened up. It wasn't anything overly special but it was good, I think I was just so full by the time we got dessert.
Amazing experience! I've been here a few times, and each time it gets better and better. . Start out with the salad bar, but I try to be careful not to fill up on cheese and salad. Standouts for me are the Manchego cheese wheel, smoked provolone, cherry peppers, and of course I love the Caesar salad with fresh grated Parmigiano cheese on top.. . Now on to the meats... so yummy. I have to admit I was so busy enjoying everything that I failed to make sure I knew exactly what meats I was eating. My absolute favorite selection is the beef ribs. It was by far the most tender meat... seriously so delicious. I couldn't get enough! I also really enjoyed the filet. It's so easy to gorge yourself on everything. My boyfriend really liked the Parmesan crusted chicken, but honestly, I learned something about myself... Once I've eaten a great piece of red meat, I don't see any reason to eat chicken. Next time I need to remember to try the chicken pieces first. There was another great cut of meat that I loved, but I'm not sure what kind. They serve it with three round cuts of meat on the skewer, and when they slice it off it comes out in a sort of circle. It is charred on the outer edge, with a layer of fat followed by the red meat inside. It was so flavorful. I'm usually a little wary of fatty pieces, but this was out of this world. . . My boyfriend ordered a bloody mary and I got the red sangria. Both of us were really happy with our choice. We also splurged and ordered two desserts because we couldn't agree. He ordered the key lime and I got the bananas fosters pie. I thought mine was absolutely delicious, but of course he thought his was better. Both were really good. . Side note: the hostess was not very friendly. She didn't smile or seem to be very welcoming. I just expect to be greeted with a smiling, happy face when I walk into a restaurant. She was all business, not rude, but very serious.
