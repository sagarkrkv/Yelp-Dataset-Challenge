If the Trump Tower was located anywhere but Vegas, It'd be perfect. But it just seems so out of place (literally) for a Vegas hotel.. . I came here with a large sponsored group over the weekend, so everything was complimentary, so I can't say anything about money value of this hotel.. . The lobby/public area was very clean and spacious. Gold as far as the eye can see.. I loved the mini suites with the kitchenette and REAL fridge. Not one of those mini 'bars' with $10 bottles of water and $15 bags of M&M's. Too bad realistically, you won't be cooking anything at all here. The bathroom was amazing with the built in tv on the mirror (perfect for bumping music while getting ready for the night!). Separate HUGE bathtub. Shower head had the weakest pressure and sprayed water unevenly. . . Beds were very very comfortable and we had a great view of the strip. Unfortunately there is ZERO reception in the room/hallway. My phone was basically useless unles sI went into the lobby or was out on the strip. Also, the wifi never connected!. . The pool area is huge! We missed it, as we came too late. But one of the roaming guards was nice enough to let us go outside anyway and dip out feet under the cold vegas sky and take pictures! How nice! He also gave us a hint on how to get to the rooftop, but the door to the roof was locked when we found it :( Thanks anyway random nice roaming security dude!. . My 2 biggest pet peeve about this hotel was the elevator and the fact that it doesn't have a casino. I knew the casino thing before coming, but the problem would arise from the fact that we would be on the strip, and some people would want to go back to the room. We would have to take a taxi or wait for the shuttle since the hotel is off the strip. Because I wanted to save money, I would hitch a ride back with my buddies. But once we were at the hotel, I realize I actually wanted to gamble some more and there was nothing I could do unless I wanted to walk back to the strip in my painful heels or hail another $$$ cab.. . The elevators were annoying! They put my group on floors 31, 34, and 35. The elevators split at floor 34. So to get from my room 31 to my friend's room in 35, I would have to get on the first elevator to get to floor 34, get off, walk down the hallway to the next one, and take that one to 35! The first day we were so lost and confused it took forever to even find our friends. The worst was when I had to travel from floor 35, take an elevator, grab our friends on floor 34, take a new elevator to 31, grab our stuff, then 1 more to the lobby. . . Confusing? Yes indeed.. . But in the end, it is a great hotel with minimal problems. But for vegas purposes, I prefer being on the strip with a resort/casino.
Went to Vegas the last week of March 2014. My stay at The Trump was great. These rooms are very clean and service is great. . . The rooms are awesome and they come with a nice kitchenette, living room, with a pull our bed. Tub, the shower and stall are covered, the mirror inside the bathroom has a TV, a small fridge, microwave, and a coffee maker. They don't have self parking if that's what you are looking for. They only provide valet parking. . . I would gladly recommend this hotel.
I spent 4 nights here with my wife during Christmas 2013. It is pure royalty here. Everybody was really helpful and understanding. In-suite food is amazing quality and quantity. Although it is pricey, it is worth every penny you spend. I will definitely recommend it
This is an amazing hotel! Everything was so spotless and clean, and the way that we check that is my husband walked around with his white socks on and they stayed white. The bathtub the bathroom the kitchen everything was absolutely spotless. The bathtub was huge, making for an amazing romantic time for a bath. There was a TV set inside of the mirror in the bathroom. The service was amazing, everybody went out of their way to make sure that our stay was perfect. We ordered room service and it was absolutely delicious, and it came served hot. We were there celebrating our anniversary, and they even provided us with a complimentary bottle of wine. The view from our room was absolutely gorgeous. . During our stay, they called up to the room to make sure that every interaction that we had with the hotel staff was to our liking. I would definitely recommend the Trump to anybody, and everybody, if you're looking for an amazing stay where you feel pampered and appreciated!
This place is sweeet, especially for someone that hates walking through a smokey casino to get to your room.. . I lucked into a corner suite because my husband was a muckety muck in a big group staying there. But the group got a good rate, so definitely consider booking a pack there for a trade show.. . Walk to/from the Sands is very painless, since half of it is on a deserted walkway, with just a short walk on the annoying strip sidewalk.. . It's across the street from the big fashion mall -- yawner unless you need an outfit in a pinch, which I did. A few good mall/strip restaurants nearby.. . The 2-room suite is amazing. Full kitchen, including dishwasher, two bathrooms, washer/dryer (in one! a technological marvel).. . There's a mandatory resort fee (Internet and gym -- I hate that crap), so make sure you factor that into the rate.. . Staff is friendly, especially the housekeepers.. . The robes in the suite were the must luscious I've ever experienced, and believe you me, I've worn a lot of robes. I wore it the whole four days, including to the trade show.. . I don't give it a 5 because 1) the pillows were meh and 2) the water in the massive marble shower was a mere trickle.
Work
I loved this hotel. Not having a casino at the hotel is amazing. No smoke, no walking 10 miles through the lobby to get to the front desk or outside. Super big rooms, Starbucks coffee for the coffee maker, view of the strip, TV in the bathroom mirror and the sitting area were awesome. Only reasons for not giving it fiver stars were:. 1.) Bathroom Shower Head was really low (although detachable). 2.) Free shuttle was limited in destinations. For being off the strip, it would be nice to have the shuttle take you more places. . . I will stay here next time in Vegas. Great Value!
I've stayed at this hotel twice so far (both times to celebrate my birthday) and my young son accompanied me. We BOTH love coming here! The second time was last year ( the night before thanksgiving) and were upgraded to a 1 bedroom corner suite at no charge and also were granted late checkout (3:00 pm). The service from the valet when you first drive in, up to the front desk personnel when you check in and out was impeccable. Our suite was utterly fantastic, my only regret was not being able to stay a second night! I love the soap and hair products that are provided in the room as well, smells so yummy! I will be back for my birthday this November!!
With shuttles going to Wynn and Caesars, unlmtd bottled water,  & regal presentation the Trump is the ideal 5 star resort.
Great hotel, relaxing away from the chaos and. Didn't give it 5 stars because my bathroom shower was clogged and they were unable to repair it before I had to leave for dinner. Also the tv reception is sporadic and just flat out didn't work at one point.. . Everything else was as expected. Larger than average basic room which was very nice.. . This hotel is valet only FYI. A little confusing when looking for the self parking for a first time guest.. . I would recommend this place and will keep it as an option for myself in the future.
Beware there is a significant resort charge hidden until checked in by which time it is too late. Be prepared to feel cheated and swindled! Otherwise it is a great hotel especially for the price. Also odd though is there is no self parking only valet which is free, but can take a while especially during checkout.
Here's the deal..... Had this been rated as a 3 or 4 star hotel, I would have easily given them more stars.  But when you classify yourself as a "five star" resort, my expectations rise right along with your rating.. . The good:. * I booked on Priceline under "name your price" for $105 and was accepted.  This was during Spring Break, so it was a great deal.. * location is right across the street from the mall & Nordstrom.  If you like to shop, you will love the location.. * NO CASINO, therefore quiet and relaxing.. * Spectacular views from the higher floors.  We were in room 5616 & while it faced the "old town" side of the Strip, it was nonetheless spectacular. . * complimentary valet parking.  You may have to wait 5-10 min, but it's well worth the wait.. * microwave, mini fridge, built in hot plate, & sink make it super easy to have a wide variety of snacks & drinks in the room.  Anyone with kids will surely understand this!!  :). * huge bathroom with shower & juccuzi tub.. * complimentary shuttle to & from Caesars Palace & the Mirage (not sure if it's the Mirage or another hotel.....) every 15 min.  Very convenient feature.. * Yoga @ 9:00 for $12.00. * great gym. * express elevators with three separate areas servicing certain floors. * TV in the bathroom mirror. * friendly & efficient front desk staff. * complimentary water & Starbucks coffee in room daily.. * extremely comfortable king sized bed.. * If you are older and/or have any type of issue that makes walking great distances an issue, this is the hotel for you!  You pull your car up to the front doors & literally walk for 3-4 minutes to the elevators to your room.  Door to door in less than 10 minutes..... And maybe even less.  This is a huge plus and so much more peaceful than schlepping through a huge, loud, smoky casino.. . . The Bad:. * the room was dusty. * the pull out couch was miserably uncomfortable with springs popping through.  They need to be replaced.. * the pool had trash in it.  Granted it was windy, but it was still gross.. * $25.00 "resort fee" that was never really discussed until I asked.. * the desk was all stained & damaged. * the window vent was broken & constantly made loud noise. * the carpet was kind of nasty . * I had to call down for bedding for the extra bedding for the couch & wait 20+ minutes to get it.  This should have been in the room.. * freight train noise every morning..... Early morning...... All morning long.. . I honestly enjoyed my stay.  However, I would not rate this as a five-star experience at all.  This hotel is 3 1/2- 4 stars at best.
Great hotel, right across fashion show mall and Wynn. Everything was perfect except for that train passing by, if you are a light and troubled sleeper like I am you may want to skip it and consider an off the strip hotel. The bathtub has 3 jet settings it was amazing and our view from the 26th floor was gorgeous. Comfy beds and the pool downstairs offers waiter service and indoor cafe.
Wow what an experience again. Last year I had a wonderful experience at Las Vegas Trump hotel celebrating my girlfriends birthday. So I decided to try it again at the same hotel, and sure enough I was glad I did. I booked for a 2 night stay Friday through Sunday on Easter weekend. I wanted to make it would truly be a special weekend for my girlfriend by getting a suite with a beautiful view of the Las Vegas strip. Sure enough I contacted Trump Int Hotel LV through email and Maribel Rodriguez helped me out. I told her about me and my girlfriend celebrating her birthday weekend and she replied back with an upgraded room with a beautiful view high in the hotel and birthday amenities at no charge. And boy did they deliver! Once we checked in, the girl at the front desk said happy birthday to my girlfriend. We went to our room to see the marvelous view of our suite. In the closest they had 2 soft bathrobes for me and my girlfriend. When my girlfriend went to the bathroom to put her hair straightener away in one of the bathroom cabinets, she found a cute little box of delicious belgian truffle chocolates, yum! Both her and I were very astonished by this sweet gesture. Day 2 came and the Bell Captain named Brady Stanford approached me and told me how my day was going. I told him that it was going wonderful and I am glad to be celebrating my girlfriends birthday. Sure enough he says, "Oh its your girlfriends birthday, let me see what I can do for you.". He asked me what my girlfriends name was and what room I was staying in, and so I told him. Sure enough around 3 AM after coming back from a Las Vegas night club, someone left a message on my door that said to contact room service for an amenity. I call and sure enough a man named Martin comes and delivers 6 big chocolate dipped strawberries to our suite along with a birthday card with my girlfriends name on it. Me and my girlfriend were definitely very delighted for the kind act Mr.Stanford did for my girlfriend. The chocolate dipped strawberries tasted so delicious with our Stella Rosa wine! So I want to give out a big thank you for making my girlfriends birthday experience even more special. Thank you Maribel Rodriguez , Brady Stanford, Martin and all staff members that took part of making our experience at the Trump hotel a very beautiful 2 night stay. Aside from that, they also gave us a late 1pm checkout which was a plus after partying hard on Saturday night and two wine glasses to drink our Stella Rosa that we brought from home. I will definitely come back and continue to book again at Trump International hotel when I visit Las Vegas. Twice they have made my experience special with my girlfriend and I can guarantee they will continue to do so. . . Notes: Trump hotel offers shuttle service at no charge and drops you off at either Wynn hotel and casino or Caesars Palace. The shuttle is right outside in front of the hotel. It is a big black van that fits around 10 people. They also pick you up from the same place they dropped you off (Wynn or Caesars), as a shuttle passes every 15 minutes to drop off people from Trump and take people back to Trump. The shuttle stops at 12AM at Caesars and at 2AM at Wynn if Im not mistaken. Don't let the distance from the strip discourage you, the shuttle drops you where all the action is at (Caesars). . . Notes: They offer shoe shining service at no charge, and boy did they made my Stacy Adams shine super nice and black before I went to the club!. . Notes: All rooms come with a big fridge, microwave, and a stove. This is a plus since we brought water bottles, beer and liquor with us. We kept all of our drinks cold!
Seriously the nicest room I've stayed in! All the rooms are suite style and I stayed in a two bathroom and one bedroom. It had a fully equipped kitchen with a living room. There was so much space and there was only two of us.. . In the master bathroom they have a bathtub with jets. And the shower has two heads!. The kitchen was my favorite part because we brought groceries and cooked our own meals. Keep in mind that the trump doesn't have a casino nor any restaurants. . . They do have a shuttle that takes you to the Wynn and encore and the harrahs/ bally's  area. There is also a free shuttle that takes you to and from the airport which is pretty awesome.
This is a 5 star hotel.  Overall it was a nice place.  We went to bar for happy hour and our bar tender was excellent.  The room was excellent.  The only thing (may be good or bad) is there is no casino in the hotel.  Their  shuttle to the strip runs about every 15 minutes, but stops at midnight...a little early for Vegas
A group of us came down for a working trip from out of town and stayed here. I am hard to impress and dared the Trump to give me it's best shot. . . Our bevy of vehicles entered the valet parking entrance and were quickly greeted by several very cheerful and swift gentlemen who carefully took our cars into their care and whisked them away. Doormen opened doors into a beautifully appointed foyer area. Fresh flowers were in evidence and everything was sparkling and elegant. My first impressions were of a establishment that took pride in being a resort of note. Check in was easy, and we went up into our rooms. . . Our one bedroom suites on the top half of the hotel were absolutely stunning. Crisp linens, full kitchen, everything spotless. Soft beds, clean sheets, little amenities such as the master bath with whirlpool jets. When we called housekeeping to request utensils, extra tea bags and water, they were brought to our room within fifteen minutes. The staff's deportment was impeccable. Polite, well mannered, professional. . . Fitness center and pool were lovely and easy to access, and none too crowded. . . A shuttle takes you to either Caesars or Encore/Wynn in swanky Mercedes vans. Extremely convenient! Also, no casinos and no smoking to be seen. Fabulous! . . I have stayed at other establishments, but this one takes my breath away. Well done Trump! We'll be back!
This hotel is nice, I got a decent price through AAA for three nights on Easter weekend.  The staff is very polite and responsive.  Required valet is a little annoying; we needed to go to our car a couple of times which required an escort (and of course a tip - sew me, I'm being cheap, paying someone so I can go to my car?).  That guy was friendly however, when asking about our activities for the weekend we mentioned LV Indoor Skydiving.  He said he knew someone who worked there and could get us a hook-up.  We saw him the next day, he said the same thing.  Nothing came of it.  I wasn't looking for a hookup but TRUMP employees shouldn't be spouting (especially unsolicited) nonsense if they aren't going to follow-up.  We got a corner suite, nice view, lots of windows, love the double entry to reduce hallway noise, full but empty kitchen (slightly useless).  The bathroom is enormous which honestly seems completely pointless but loved the giant picture window over the bathtub was a great touch.  Loved the view, it was clean, well maintained, very comfortable bed.  Absolutely STUPID ridiculous that the pool closes at 7pm.   One block from the strip makes it not worth mentioning but everyone seems all uptight about it, they offer a free shuttle to the Wynn and Ceasars so why complain.  I like seeing what different hotels have to offer. I'm not sold on only returning to this one.
I stayed in a junior suite, and because the jucuzzi tub wasnt working correctly we were upgrade into  a 1 bedroom  suite that was absolutly amazing.
Checked into trump towers for our honeymoon. We traveled from austin Texas to experience Las Vegas. . . Positive. Rooms are spacious with a large bathroom. TV inside the mirror in the powder room. Beautiful views of the strip. Heated pool and awesome fitness room. Complimentary water and valet service. Fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious and you can never go wrong with starbucks coffee. Hotel shampoo and conditioner are larger bottles that smell very good. The shower is huge and the bed is very comfortable. . . Negative . . We checked in and noticed a very loud wind noise in the room. When we called the front desk they said its common because it's windy out. We requested someone come look and they sent an engineer who already had replacement parts in hand when he entered. He explained the vent was broken and he replaced it which immediately dulled the wind noise. He said its common for this hotel and has a few more rooms to go to with the same issue. . . Room service food quality was very poor. Pizza appeared to be frozen with small amount of toppings. Calamari, I could have made at home from a frozen bag. Very oily sauteed spinach. . . Shower temperature was finicky. It was either scaling hot or super cold. Too lengthy period to get water temp to my liking. Similar issues with my friends in a neighboring room. . . Minor Stains on the curtains and major on the carpet when you enter the room. . . Hotel manager delivered our baggage then proceeded to disclose that the train is very loud when passing the hotel. Boy was he right. Once at night and early morning the training sounded its horn and wow we got out of bed early. I'm not sure if the hotel will remedy that eventually in the future, but had we known about the train we probably wouldn't have stayed in this hotel. . . Over all we had a pleasant experience. We were not in the hotel much but for 190 a night we get what we pay for. . . Nice staff and very helpful valet.
I like the fact that there is no casino. However, there is definitely a wind noise in the room most of the time,  the train is pretty loud when it comes by and room service was very slow. . . We asked for 2 wine glasses from the front desk. An hour and a half later they had still not arrived and it was time for us to go to a show. When we returned they were there but at that point we really had no use for them. . . Other than that the rooms were very big with great views and clean.
This place is great if you want something nice but cheaper than other 4 star hotels. Use priceline or hotwire and you'll be happy with the hotel. If you pay full-price you may wish you opted for a different hotel. . . It is definitely NOT ON THE STRIP. It is a short walk to the strip but a walk nonetheless. . . Parking is sometimes a pain so we chose to park in the mall parking directly across the street. No need to tip or wait for the valet. :) . . If you can, request a view of the Strip otherwise you may be facing I-15 and a bunch of sex shops.
When booking our room I noticed the rate was significantly less at Trump than it's neighbors Wynn and Encore. I was hesitant but booked anyway because the rooms looked nice. When we arrived at the hotel we mentioned it was our first time there and asked if they can help make our stay more memorable and the guy who checked us in upgraded us to a killer suite without hesitation. We got unpacked and headed down to the lobby bar and in the elevator, a man asked how our stay was so far and we answered so far so good. He turned out to be the GM and after our first round of drinks were brought to us we were told he had taken care of them for us. It was a great way to begin our mini vacay! Thank you Trump Intl for going above and beyond and we will definitely be visiting your hotel again soon!
So my group of friends and I decided to take a chance with this hotel after seeing that I could save $100+ per night compared to the other 5-star hotels on the strip, i.e. Wynn/Encore, Palazzo/Venetian, Caesar's, the City Center Hotels, etc. . . The hotel is located about a block off the actual strip, just down the street from the Wynn and Encore. In fact, we had a very nice view of the two hotels from our window on the 17th floor. Our group figured it would be best since we planned to club at XS on both Friday and Saturday night of our stay. Luckily for us, the hotel provides a round-the-clock shuttle to the Wynn that arrives every 15 minutes or so that will take you on a 5 minute ride down the block to the Wynn. Unfortunately for us, this service ends at 2am, so if you plan to stay at the club til it closes, you'll have to cab your way back since the ladies aren't about to walk back to Trump in their clubbing shoes.. . As for the hotel itself, it was very nice. Fancy enough compared to some of the others but again, I didn't think it compared to some of the nicest "true" 5-stars in the area. If you've stayed at Aria, Vdara, Cosmopolitan, Venetian, and Palazzo, you know what 5 stars is like!. . Parking is valet ONLY which for some should be a convenience, but was annoying for me because I had to tip every time I picked up my car and depending on the line, had to wait also. Our room had one king bed + a sleeper sofa (no double bed + sleeper sofa option available!), the sleeper had no sheets, and we were missing an iron+ironing board and had to call 5 times for them to bring one. Despite this, the room itself was very clean and the big king bed was very comfortable. Bathroom featured frosted glass doors for the shower and the toilet area so you could be going about your business if other people wanted to use the restroom at the same time to wash their hands, do their hair, etc. at the vanity. Not something you should do most of the time, but when everyone is trying to use the restroom at the same time to get to the club in time, you gotta do what you gotta do. Also, no casino or buffet downstairs was something of a negative in case you want to go down for a quick meal or to gamble a couple of bucks away. The positive side of this is that you don't get all the noise, sounds, and smells of having those things downstairs. Didn't get to see or use the gym or the pool area, but they did look nice in pictures. . . Would I recommend this place? If there are only 2 or 3 people in your group, this is a perfectly good place if you don't mind the distance and don't mind not having a casino or buffet downstairs. For the younger crowd that comes with an entourage, I suggest skipping this place and forking over the extra money for a nicer place with 2 double beds and the sleeper sofa. . . So overall.... The good: Bargain price compared to the other 5-star hotels, comfortable basic room is perfect for 2 people, 3 at most. For a bigger group, opt for a 1 or 2-bedroom suite. Quiet if that's what you're looking for in a Vegas hotel. Tacos El Gordo just down the street! Very good for late night munchies.. The bad: Valet parking only was somewhat inconvenient, not super close to other hotels/resorts, no buffet or casino downstairs, no options for 2 double beds - one king bed only in a regular room.. The ugly: 5 calls to get an iron in our room - not cool if you have to iron your clothes before clubbing!
