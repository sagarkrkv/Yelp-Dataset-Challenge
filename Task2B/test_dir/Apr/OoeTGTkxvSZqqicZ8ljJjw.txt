Hakkasan - you can try to be the top dog of vegas clubs all you want but you've been slacking. . . The set up just BLOWS. One main stage with everything surrounding it. unless you have the luxury of a table / bottle service, good luck finding a place to sit ladies! . . The "dance floor" always gets crowded - oh and the ladies here have not been poppin either. . . I say stick with XS and surrender if you wanna have a great time.
First time at this club last night! Omgosh I love this club already. Calvin Harris was awesome! He's so pretty. Dance floor is kind of small but it's alright. Had a super great time. Awesome and nice people minus maybe a hand full. We're all just trying to have a good time.  Great ending to a bachlorette party weekend.
This club is definitely one of my least favorite clubs on the Vegas strip.  My experience here is based on my personal opinion and may vary person by person, which is likely especially because a club experience is so different for everyone.. . Anyway, besides the long lines and the JAM-PACKED and OVERCROWDED space/rooms (which I am aware of because after all, it is a club right?), I also did not like the music (before the headlining DJ came on) and the policy here.  The drinks average nearly $20 each and water is a whopping $9 for a tiny fiji bottle.  They DO NOT serve tap water so you have to buy a tiny bottle of water just to stay hydrated.. . I think all in all, because this club is overcrowded, overpriced, and just blah music, I likely won't be coming here and rather have a better, safer experience at XS or Marquee.
I was here for a private party and it was awesome. Good music and vibe. The waiters and waitresses were very attractive, I can see why this place is so popular.
This is my favorite club in Vegas. They have a amazing line  Dj's that play's here and tonite it was Dada Life.Great music great vibe. The only negative thing I have to say is that the dance get so pack that you could barely move. But for me I'm there for a good time and for the DJ's.
Tons of fun! I saw Calvin Harris spin here over the weekend, I can't complain. We had a table and bottle service fairly close to the DJ and they cocktail waitresses were great, very attentive and assisted in pouring drinks almost the whole night. I love how they gave out foam glow sticks at around 2am. The place itself it stunning. I can't say I would go if I didn't have a table, as the place was packed, but if you have table service, it's definitely a ton of fun and you will have a blast!
This place was awesome! We met a promoter at the casino in the hard rock hotel and he got us in free and gave us free drink tickets. The venue is beautiful and the music was great. There was a good mix of male and female on the dance floor. This is the best nightclub we've been to so far. Much better than Marquee.
Here is the thing about Hakkasan, if you don't have a table, you don't have a good time. . . Maybe that sounds spoiled but it's true. I am a Vegas local and I go out once every few weeks to one of the nightclubs. Hakkasan is 100 times better if you are partying at a table with a group of friends. If you are stuck walking through the club that ends up just being a throng up people, you will not have fun. You will just battle your way through crowds the whole night. . . Not a bad club, but don't go here unless you want to buy bottle service.
For the past two Vegas trips, we have had at least one night where we stopped at Hakkasan. We were treated awesomely both times.. . The first time, I went with a group of girls on a Thursday. We arrived early with little to no line. There were free drink tickets for vodka drinks. I don't remember what DJ was there that night, no one spectacular.. . We stayed out late and danced our butts off. We met new people and had a great time. . . Hakkasan always has the top DJs and is built beautifully. There are always awesome go go dancers and light shows up front. And the dance floor is big, but never big enough.. . The second trip we made, we came only because Rose Rabbit Lie closed at 3 am, but we knew Hakkasan would still be open. We didn't get there until about 3:15/3:30. They were hesitant to let us in, but because we were girls, they did. . . Obviously the DJ had left by then. I don't remember who it was but it was Saturday night so it was someone good. . . When we got to the dance floor there was cotton everywhere! What the hell?! A pillow fight happened I think! Crazy! Anyway, we ordered drink and proceeded to keep dancing until 4 am when they sent everyone away.. . It was a great time. Hakkasan has never done me bad. And their DJ lineup cannot be beat by any other Vegas club.
A lot of famous,  great,get the party started djs over the weekend.  Ladies,  if your bad at walking in heals pack some roll up flats. Your feet will get tired from dancing!
All I saw were gorgeous women, the finest men, and top of the billboard DJ's. How could anyone underestimate their visit to Hakkasan Nightclub? . . This was the first Las Vegas nightclub I went to & of course I had a blast! But be mindful that it can be thoroughly packed when a big DJ such as Tiesto is scheduled to spin during the evening. We couldn't believe how big of a nightclub it was, and I believe it had three or four floors! Drinks are slightly on the pricey side, but it's Vegas, what do you expect? . . Get to the line as early as possible, we were lucky we were able to get to the front of the line at 10pm. Ladies are free, but my understanding is that men are charged a $50 entrance. . . Wear your finest dresses, falsies, and go all out! Don't forget to bring a pair of foldable flats ladies, you'll be dancing your lovely tush the night away for hours on end here x
Awesome night w Calvin Harris!! Kinda of short set, but I'll take it... Very crowded, if you don't have table service, u r a peasant among the riches, & have to keep walking & being whipped by security guards flashlight & they hurt the eyes man!!! Lol.... Anyways, had a great time, I would have loved it if there was a private place table service for parties of two.Wanted to take the lady out, but totally got squished in the heavy crowd. Have tix & easy getting in...
I came here with my husband to see Tiesto. This wasn't my first experience in Vegas or with a nightclub. I have never experienced such lack of professionalism, and a lack of customer service. My husband and I will never go back there again. We were on Brian Pfeiffer's guest list. My husband had to pay general admission   ( no big deal), and he got in right away. The women were herded into a guest list line where men walked by on the second level and took pictures of women. I got there at 9:30pm, and was in line for 2 hours. I should have just paid general admission, which I later did. I got up to the front of the guest list line where I was told that I was not on the list. I texted my promoter, and he basically said there wasn't anything he could do. The group behind me that I befriended tried to put me on their list, but the guest list attendant wouldn't let them.  So, I paid general admission and met my husband. We were trying to get down to the dance floor      ( which there is only one way down that we could see), and we were stuck on the stairs due to people not moving. I just got out of a walking boot from having a fractured foot so I have to use the handrails.  The bouncer named Michael kept telling my husband to move. After the 5th time, of my husband being tapped to move. I kindly let Michael know that we would move if he could tell the people in front of us to move so I could use the handrail. He told me that I didn't need the handrail to go down the stairs. I then kindly informed him that I need the handrail to go down the stairs that I just got out of cam boot, and that you can't deny someone the use of the handrails, and that if I was to fall that he would accept full responsibility.I also had my foot taped so I could have some extra stability in heels. I asked Michael to flash his light at my ankle to see that I did have it taped, and that I wasn't BSing him.  He then told me that I couldn't go to the dance floor if I couldn't go down the stairs without using the handrail. He still refused to tell the people blocking the stairs to move. My husband said that while he was in there for the 2 hours waiting for me that he was told that he couldn't just stand anywhere that he had to continue walking. Also, by the same bouncer that told me that I couldn't use the handrails. . . The pros:. - a new club. - great light show with the DJ. - Nice bartenders. - drink prices are pretty on par with other clubs. $27 for a beer and a vodka soda.. . Cons:. - Horrible bouncers. - Horrible customer service
All the one star reviews on here are dead on! Stay away! Hakkasan is a death trap! Attempted to go see Tiesto this past weekend, (April 19th, 2014) and ended up not even sticking around for him because of how overcrowded, unorganized and just lousy this place really is. My girlfriend and I were looking so forward to an amazing night here and it was an instant buzz kill the minute we got in. Most everything about this place just sucked! If you do not have a gazillion dollars to spend on table/bottle service you are invisible and a nobody at this club! You will get knocked around like a ping pong ball between all the bouncers constantly shooing you along to keep you moving and the mad crush of people everywhere. Everything was an effort in this place! From having to wait in line for 20 minutes to get an overpriced watereddown drink to actually trying to get to the dance floor! We never were able to make it to the dance floor because of how overcrowded it was! I wanted a water because of how hot it was with all the people and poor ventilation and the bar tender told me with a straight face that a water would be $9 for a small 11oz bottle of Fiji water as a regular cup of water was obviously not an option! Unfortunately it just all got to a point of being beyond a joke and we waved the white flag and gave up on this place before Tiesto ever even came out!
Horrible horrible.. . Came here Saturday night to see Tiesto, but ended up leaving at 1 when being so fed up with crowds and "security" or bouncers, whatever they're called.. . Arrived at around 10:30, and went to look for prepaid line, was told it was on the other side because the line was "overflowing". Which when we get to the over flow line, was called back to the original spot we were standing in. There was one small group there ahead of us. At one point in line I overheard two of the staffers talking about some girls tramp stamp, loudly and not discreet at all. Rude. . . Inside, no real standing space. You're either on the dance floor, in a bottle service booth, or in the way. To which one staffer made it his job that night to keep telling me and my boyfriend we couldn't stand wherever we were standing. But whenever it was girls standing there, he had no problem at all.. . After having enough of that guy, we headed to the jammed packed dance floor, which was probably smaller than my backyard. Everyone was shoulder to shoulder pushing and shoving.. . The worst part was the things that happened on the dance floor. Two girls were so drunk out of their minds, a group of guys were passing them around taking turns making out with them while another guytook photos. Lifting the girls dresses, sticking their hands on their panties, even though the girls knew enough to keep pulling down their dresses and saying no. Practically rape. Fights nearly breaking out, people falling on the floor. Horrible.. . When we finally had enough, trying to make our way out, some girl was openly lighting her bong in the hallway. Idk how that made it in but yep. . . Police, fire Marshalls etc. need to look into this place ASAP!  Horrible. . . Oh, and sister ended up leaving at 1:30, and still no Tiesto.
If you're only going to take one thing away from this review, it's don't go to Hakkasan and try the other clubs the strip has to offer like Marquee, XS, or Lights!. . My friends and I have had a multitude of terrible experiences at Hakkasan. I know why do I keep coming back right? Because they have the most popular DJs I'll give them that, but also because I unfortunately, trust too wholeheartedly. . . I contacted the promoter, Peter Nguyen (avoid this promoter like the plague), and he was willing to help my friends and I get in for free with table service. However, we showed up on Friday night and he said that we would be found. The catch was he didn't even know what we looked like. We ended up being packed in like sardines on the dance floor, while guys were shoving and punching us! It also took us DAYS to get on and the same amount to get off. . Then on Saturday night we went back because he apologized and promised unlimited table service. When we texted him that we were here, he said made up some bullshit excuse that he couldn't come get us for another 2 hours, so we waited. When the clock struck 12:30 am, we texted him and he failed to reply. We were left feeling stupid yet again.. . I gave both Ling-Ling (bottom hip-hop floor) and Hakkasan a chance, andneedless to say, I'll most likely not be coming back to this terrible and overly crowded club. Also girls, the whole club is built with angled walkways and this really gets to your toes in those heels and cuts off all circulation to those poor little piggies. Avoid having to walk up and down these treacherous walkways by avoiding Hakkasan!
I went here twice only because it resided in the hotel that we were staying and that it was convenient.  We came here with a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette party.  We were on the VIP party list and when you approach this line, it is ridiculous.  There is no organization whatsoever to talk to the host.  It's really depends whether you can squeeze through the crowd or not to talk to the host.  I can see how a lot of arguments could occur in this situation.  After waiting for 30 minutes, our club promoter came to get us.  We enter an elevator to get to the club.. . The ambiance and decor is really nice here.  The main dance floor gets really crowded.  If there was more room, i think we would have had a lot of fun.  I loved that they had the confetti drop.  It felt like new years for a minute.  There was also dollar bills flying down towards me.  I don't know if this is a normal thing for this club or we had some ballin' celebrity that decided to throw dollar bills into the crowd.  It was pretty fun trying to get the dollas! We came away with a whopping $5 that went towards the tip of our drinks lol.  Most of the music played on the this dancefloor is EDM.  . . This place has alot of stairs so make sure you wear somewhat comfy shoes girls!. Their hip hop room though on the other hand is pretty cool.  I just only wished it was bigger.  It's super crowded down there on the dance floor.  I only wished we had some room to dance.  We ended up dancing on a box but to be drunk and dance up there that long, it's kind of scary. . . Overall, wish there was more hip hop music in vegas instead of this edm invasion but oh well, what can you do? It's fun with the right company!
BOO.. . The only good thing was we got in for free with tickets from a promoter.. . The club is cramped, the dance floor was full of idiots pushing through constantly and stepping all over me. I could hardly move, let alone dance. . . $20 for a watery, weak AMF (how the hell did they manage that?!).. Nowhere to sit. No outside area. (Marquee, XS, and Surrender definitely win here.). They will not serve you glasses of water, only bottles of overpriced Fiji. Really?!?!?!. . . I've been to all the clubs in Vegas...this one is not worth visiting.
WORST CLUB EVER! If only 0 stars existed. I went to Las Vegas with friends to celebrate my sisters birthday. Purchased our tickets from home in San Francisco and showed up ready to party! The line was very long but we got in in literally 2 minutes. The club is beautiful on the inside but man is this place small and full of douche bags and sluts. My girls could not sit anywhere because if you don't have a VIP booth then you can't sit anywhere. . . The dance floor was so cramped! The bouncers literally push you so more people can fit. I don't get how this is legal. As for the people on the dance floor, there was a couple almost having sex. The guy kept dancing and fingering the girl and she had his hands down his pants as she unbuttoned his shirt. The bouncers saw this and acted as though nothing was going on. The watered down $25 drink was ridiculous and the bass in the music system is nonexistent! . . My sister got pissed off at how shitty this place was that she asked to head out. We didn't even get to see the DJ that was playing that night. SO we headed to another club (Piranha) no cover and we got some very good drinks and danced til 4AM. This being said, WE WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS CLUB. EVER!
Get here early and enjoy it while the fun lasts because the later it's gets the more packed it gets and this place has the smallest dance floor ever! It's gets so packed its uncomfortable and the bouncers are rude and push you out of the way to make a path. The atmosphere here is really cool, but it's just ridiculously small. Calvin Harris was good, but we had to leave because I just couldn't stand the right crowd any longer. It's not comfortable.
Ok that's what I'm talking about. This place has exceeded my expectations. Sorry that I haven't updated my review sooner.  My bf and I went back here the weekend of Jan 17 for Ailyne H birthday. We were on the VIP list. I immediately called my contact to let her know we were outside the club.  She quickly greeted us and escorted us to the entrance of the club and next thing you know we were inside with no wait and with complimentary drink tickets in our hands. SCORE!. . The vibe was different this time around. Calvin Harris was absolutely amazing. Ailyne H and I were grooving to the fast beat of techno while our BFs were getting more drinks. Happy Birthday girl! Haha we were chocolate waisted. . . The BF and I agreed that this place was not bad at all. Will we come back? Probably yes! Oh and they now have in and outs which was my complain last time.. . The dance floor can get super packed. What can you expect,  its Vegas after all.  Vegas knows how to party!
Horrific. We showed up last Saturday at Hakkasan and had a terrible time. First of all, I was working with Anthony Bradley at Vegas VIP and he was awful-total swindler. He just wants to get paid on you and doesn't care if you actually get in the club or get what he promised. He connected me with Greg at Hakkasan who also, was less than helpful. He kept telling us there was a door hold and it would be another 15 minutes. Over an hour went by and 17 of us (ALL GIRLS) left! They let 17 girls walk out. We had been promised a table and a comp bottle earlier in the day and told them what time we could be there. Greg had said "that's fine that's fine" through so many texts. Obviously, it wasn't. When we got there, the table limit was 4K and they wouldn't even let us in! . . Go to a different club. You may not see Tiesto, but you will have the time of your life at places that are easier to get into like XS, Tryst, Pure, The Bank. Avoid this place like the plague or you will waste 2 hours of your night in line. Don't trust Greg or Anthony either. You will be disappointed!!!
Don't know why they have such horrible reviews because we had a great time. I go to Vegas 5 times a year and have tried to go to Hakkasan for 5 times now and kept not going for one reason or another. I knew there's no seating so I wanted to only go if we got a table. Got a table through Greg Baker, who had some tables available (I guess since it was a Sunday) and got us a reduced min of $1K which I wasn't going to pass up. He had offered us a table for $1K the night before for Tiesto too which I really wanted to take, but we were committed to XS already. . Getting in was kind of a bitch because the table line isn't so much a line as people trying to get the attention of two people with clipboards to let them in, or other people slipping money to get in faster. Luckily I called Greg and he came and got me. Note: They won't let you in without everyone there.. We went up an elevator to the main floor and lead to our table. We got a bottle of Belvedere for like $500 or something, a few Bud Lights, redbulls and waters for the table. The music was really loud, but we were in the main room so what can you expect? . The service here was amazing. The security guards wouldn't accept tips but were looking out for us nonstop. The guy who was working with our waitress to clear the table, bring us more juice, empty ashtrays, etc was impeccable. We gave him some extra money at the end of the night because he was really impressive. Every time we used some juice, we got a new bottle, every time we ashed a cigarette the ash tray was emptied. Kudos for finding such an awesome guy. . Our neighbors to the left were from SF like us and really nice. Our neighbors to the right were an Abercrombie model and Jessica Simpson's dad, so there's that. lol. At around 3, they closed our section off and moved us to the top floor of the main room to a very large table where we took all our new friends including a lovely older brittish couple who gave my friend $100 for a wedding present. Security thought we were selling them drugs at first and were shining flash lights on us, but we got it sorted. . The sound and lights here are amazing. I had to go over the productions guys running the boards and tell them. Security was really nice and let me go over to them and tell them myself. Bathrooms were really clean here as well. They had girls going silk too which was awesome to watch.. Above and Beyond was of course amazing. I can't wait to come back.
Meh... Could be flashier in the usual Vegas style.  I guess I'm into that whole rooftop bar, poolside glamour stuff they have at other places.  This is more of a concert venue, with three levels and two dance floors.  I came here for AboveandBeyond and it got pretty packed.  There was a cool dance show with Gaga-type dancers and ribbon dancers suspended from the ceiling.  But the decor itself was boring.  The crowd was attractive.  Nothing crazy impressive but it was cool.
Decided to stop by again with my husband for another try. Much better than the first time as they got the smoking issue down, thank goodness.. . Still overly packed with nowhere to walk or dance. We made it to the dance floor once at the beginning of the night and the rest of the night was standing at the back near the VIP tables staring at the dance floor instead. People were crowded up behind me as well because they had nowhere to go etc.  (minus 1-star). . The lounge was nice downstairs that was more relaxing for socializing if that's what you choose. More space and area to breathe and stretch but still didn't like how there is no outdoor area. (minus-1). . I do have to say that the staff are very nice with good customer service both times I was there. So if it wasn't for the clubs layout and literally over packing people and no outdoor area, I would give it 4 stars this time around.
