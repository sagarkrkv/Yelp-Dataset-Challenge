Went here to watch some of the NCAA games and had a good time, though we didn't have seats until towards the end of the games. The bars in the sports book area didn't seem to have enough bartenders, and sometimes the wait was painfully slow. Drinks are good, but you may have to wait..
The room was nice but there are too many negatives.  First the elevators to the room are way too far from front desk.i did not have anyone to help. There was no one at the front bell desk to help and the carpet made it very hard to take my case.the halls are noisy and the doors thin. The lines at coffee were very very long. Overall I would not recommend this place.
Sep 2013 . Room was comped for 4 out of 6 night so I did not mind staying here. . Clean room. Good service . Buffet sucked . . We went out to vegas for the 1st week of football betting. The hotel was packed.
Great stay but was not too happy with the construction work outside of our room in the hallway..was told at the time they would try to move us..on the plus side the pool drinks were amazing and the Rhumbar was awsome!!!
My husband and I come to Vegas a few times a year, and the Mirage offers the best overall experience.  Clean and comfortable rooms, efficient and delicious room service.  The Mirage pool is the best for 20 and 30 somethings to come have drinks, get some sun, and have a good time together.  It's never overcrowded or bombarded with kids like some of the other hotel pools.  Staff is always friendly and helpful.  Casino is always putting off good energy, but not over the top.   Our only complaint has been that the bathrooms in the standard rooms are a bit mundane for Vegas, but the upgraded room bathrooms are worth the extra price.  It's become our go-to hotel!
We love this hotel. The rooms are big and clean! We got complementary champagne delivered to our room after check in which was awesome. They arranged a shuttle back to the airport and it was right on time at 6am. The casino is a typical Vegas casino. I didn't love the pizza at CPK, but my husband loved the tacos he got. The yogurt shop is awesome. The mirage shop was really nice and so convenient. The pool gets crowded really early but it's beautiful so that'sunderstandable. The drinks at the pool are expensive but they're huge so they're worth it. We've stayed at many hotels in Vegas and the mirage is our fave by far.
I've been coming to Vegas for two decades. In all honesty, I've never liked the Mirage. I always thought the rooms sucked, the crowds cheezy cheap, and the game atmosphere about as pleasant as a public gas station toilet.. . Then something happened. I somehow found myself staying here for the first time in 10 years about a month ago, and have been going back every other weekend. . . Yes.... the dirt cheap night club out back is still as cheezy-vomitous as it was back in the day, with the modern-day version of young ugly pigvomit clubbers that don't know better.. . BUT.... .... they have Heritage Steak House (HO-LEE SHIZNIT GOOD!)..... ...... the rooms must have been upgraded as they are surprisingly comfortable.... .........the casino staff is uber friendly.... .............. Rhumbar is fun as SHIT (indoor and outdoor for sports days are incredifun..... ................. Carnegie Deli is just as it is back in NYC.. . While I probably won't stay here when I bring mom and senior family members, I definitely don't mind it with younger party friends.. . Mirage is fun, and is perfectly located next to all the hot clubs on the strip.
I've stayed here a couple times. One of the old timer hotels but it's been renovated over the few years. Has a good central location. Usually has pretty good deals
We have stayed at this hotel about 5 times. The last before our trip this past weekend was 4 years ago.  wow - its changed.  You dont feel like a hotel guest here you feel like a burden on them - they make it feel like they are doing you a favor by doing their jobs.  We liked to go to Bare pool which was one reason we chose this hotel.  We called a month in advance to reserve chairs at Bare for Friday and Saturday - Friday we showed later (3pm because we just got in) and they had given our "reserved" seats away.  He promised we would have them on Saturday.  We arrived at noon and he said he had to give our "reserved" seats away again but he did save a day bed for $1000 for the day!  It totally ruined our saturday and they really didn't care.  Most of the bartenders will barely make eye contact with you.  Most of the staff has no idea what is going on - its like they are all new employees - they must have a high turn over rate.  Our room was not cleaned by 7pm after returning from the day.  The house keeper in the hallway told us they dont make beds anymore.  We had to call the manager and they said yes they do clean rooms and make beds, but now we had to wait until 9pm for them to come back up.  We ordered rooom service - waited an hour - called down and they did not have record of the order.  Re-ordered had to wait another hour + and call down 4 times to check on it.  Overall - its like you are lucky if any one helps you and you are more of a hassle they have to deal with, then a guest paying their checks.  The pool staff at the regular pool were nice.
The Mirage.  Where should I start?   When my wife and I checked in on Thursday night we were told that they upgraded us to a room with a great view.  Yeah an amazing view of the roof.  After calling the front desk they moved us to a different room,  this room does have a better view.  After getting into the room I have realized that the A/C, will not cool the room below 72.  Then yesterday I went to get in the shower and the handle came off the wall in my hand.  Are you kidding me!  With the prices you pay in Vegas I at least expect a A/C that will freeze me out and the ability to take a shower with out having to schedule for maintain to do repairs.. . I would strongly rethink I ng staying here if you have thought about it.
WONDERFUL experience at the Mirage!. . ROOM SERVICE:. . Some of our travel partners ordered middle-of-the-night room service every night! Ourselves, we just did it once, for a breakfast.. . Mr. Rosie S. and I ordered the following:. . - 1 seasonal fruit plate to share: $19.  (it ended up being a HUGE portion we couldn't finish between us with apples, pears, watermelon, canteloupe and honeydew in lovely thin slices, red and green grapes, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and blackberries.. . - 1 banana to share (it didn't come on the fruit plate): $2. . - For him: order of an english muffin with butter and jam: $5 . (came toasted with hand-rolled butter, and little glass jars of orange marmalade, lemon preserves, blueberry jam and strawberry jam - they were VERY DELICIOUS!). . - For him: order of grilled bacon: $7. (he said it tasted chemically so he didn't end up eating it). . - For me: sesame seed bagel & cream cheese: $7. (it came toasted with the cream cheese on a separate plate). . All arrived in about 35-40 minutes, hot and smelling divine. They included tiny bottles of ketchup as well.. . Total came to $49.73 - that's pretty expensive for breakfast, but I went down to the hotel convenience store to get our water and juice to go with, so we saved there (sort of).. . It was pampering at its best! Who gets breakfast delivered on a table with a white tablecloth? LOVES IT!. . OUR FAVOURITE HOTEL RESTAURANTS:. - B. B. King's Blues Club (now closed) for dinner, late night and live music! LOVED the hushpuppies here!. - Carnegie Deli (late night and breakfast). - CPK - California Pizza Kitchen. Our first time trying! Had it again in the airport on our way home we liked it so much. - Blizz Frozen Yogurt Bar. . POOL:. - Will review separately, but know it is TOTALLY worth booking here if pool is on your priority list!. . SHOWS:. - Cirque du Soleil's LOVE - one of the top three live performances I have seen in my life... and that comes from a theatre person.. . ATMOSPHERE:. - All Beatles, all the time!
My husband and I were traveling to Vegas for a one night mini-vacation (away from the kids) and I've always wanted to stay at this place since it was in the middle of the strip.  Therefore, we booked a one night stay here this past weekend.  When we walked into our room, we were impressed.  The decor was modern and clean.  We booked the cheapest room (king size bed) and got a great view of the strip.  The room had a flat screen tv mounted on the wall.  The bed was very comfortable.  Carpet and floor tiles were clean.  The bathroom counter was granite.  The room was quiet.  I would of given it 5 stars but the towels were rough and the toilet paper holder was located at a weird location next to the toilet.  Every time I needed toilet paper, I had to turn to my left and reach for it.  The toiletries that were provided were shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, body wash, a couple q-tips and a couple cotton pads for the face.  There were no shower caps!  I would love to come back to Vegas and stay at this hotel again, but it seemed like all the new buildings were built towards the south part of the strip, which made our hotel feel like it was at the other end of the strip.
I've gone to Las Vegas and stayed at this hotel twice. It's casino is beautiful, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the swimming pool is huge and amazing with a waterfall. Also, the erupting volcano is really neat. It's in a great location too.
stayed here for my one year anniversary. got to the room and discovered they put us in a room with two queen beds. how romantic...took us about half an hour to get into another room with one bed (what i originally booked for). i really wanted a smoking room and they claimed that they were all out but will be willing to move us to one the next day. great, now i cant smoke for one day in my room and i cant unpack because id have to wake up early pack up all my stuff and check back into another room. we checked later that first night to see what time was best to call them to see what time to check out and call for the new smoking room. they said between 12-3pm. fine. we called them at 1pm the next day and they said to us oh dont worry about it just stay in that same room and u can smoke in it now., we'll just fog it out when ur checked. WTF....couldnt u have just done that the first time??? it wasnt like i just asked once. when we checked in we asked 3 different ppl. when we got to our room with two beds we asked again. we came again that night to check another time. sigh** oh and when im on vacation i enjoy a nice bath since my bathroom at home is only a standing shower. low and behold my bathtubs drain did not stay plugged up to even draw a bath. great. awesome. cool. never again mirage...never again
Absolutely LOVE this resort/casino.  One of my favorites in Vegas.  Having stayed as a guest, visited restaurants and bars, and the casino, here is a breakdown of my review:. . CHECK-IN/FRONT DESK. I think the check-in process at The Mirage went very smoothly for such a large resort (experienced worse at other resorts in Vegas).  My flight landed in Vegas at 7:45am, so I was at the Mirage about 8:30 that morning.  As I had planned and expected, my room was not ready since check-in wasn't until 3:00 (which was understandable and fine by me).  So I checked in my bags with the bellhops and started out my day.  Upon returning to the Mirage around 2:30 to see if my room was ready, there was actually a pretty long line for check-in.  Surprisingly, this line moved swiftly and I was at the front desk talking to a front desk clerk within 10 minutes.  At this point my room was actually ready, which kind of surprised me.  I figured I'd still have to 'come back after 3'.  Definitely a great front desk staff.. . HOTEL ROOM. My hotel room was a standard double queen room with a great view of the Volcano and the Strip on the 18th floor.  The room itself was decorated nicely and seemed very modern.  Was also very well kept (clean).  Besides the standard two queen beds and bathroom, the room had a decent sized flat screen TV (Plasma or LCD), a safe, ironing board, mini fridge, workstation/desk, ironing board, etc.  Again, very nice room.. . CASINO. In my opinion, the Casino in the Mirage has it's ups and downs.  The ups?  It's very clean and I love the theme/decorating throughout.  Plenty of slot machines and plenty of table games, and it never seems 'overcrowded' like some casinos can get.  My only downside was the table limits themselves.  Granted it's The Mirage and not Circus Circus, but I would expect to find something lower than $25 tables across the board on a Tuesday evening.  Burt I still played anyways.. . DINING. I've tried the Brazilian Steakhouse, the Buffet and BLT Burger.  All three are great places to eat with friendly staff and awesome food, but if you eat at the Mirage on a daily basis without a large budget, your wallet can thin out quickly.  However, I would recommend one meal at each of the three restaurants.  You won't regret it, especially BLT Burger.. . BARS. I love the bars throughout the Mirage.  My top two are the Sports Book bar and the bar in the atrium by the front desk.  Revolution Lounge (not the club, but the bar itself outside) is also a cool place to grab a drink or two.. . STAFF. I have yet to encounter a bad experience with a staff member at The Mirage.  Even if I was irked about something, the staff was friendly and efficient in taking care of the matter.  Staff is top notch.
The rooms are standard Vegas rooms for being on the strip. Even though you can smoke in the casino it doesn't reek of smoke which is good. There aren't many retail shops which is ok depending on what a person preference is. The thing that makes me give this casino 3 stars instead of 4 is that there are no legit food places to eat at other than the high end restaurants that start around $20 a plate. It's unfortunate to have to leave the hotel for something quick and convenient which doesn't end up being quick and convenient at all.

Unlike some sports books, it actually feels welcoming when you walk in.  Cocktail Servers are also abundant unlike some other Sports Books in Vegas.. . STAFF - 5 Stars.

If you're looking for a decently priced hotel on the strip, this is def one of them.  Rooms are clean and staff is nice.
