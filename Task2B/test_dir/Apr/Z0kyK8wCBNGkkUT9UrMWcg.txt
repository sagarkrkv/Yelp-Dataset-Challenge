So far still one of my favorites steaks in town... yumm
We had a huge party of 16 & the server was FANTASTIC (Travis), the service was always going, very fast & efficient. I've never been in a large group like that & had such great service. . . The food obviously was fantastic. I would have loved to have a T-Bone on the menu but he bone in ribeye was magnificent.  The sides are expensive & decent but nothing to spend your time on. The appetizers!!!!!!!!! Crab cakes were amazing. Everyone at our table stated they were the best crab cakes ever made; after eating them I had to agree to that sentiment. They were amazing.
Absolutely wonderful!  My husband and I ordered the crab cake as an appetizer and it was simply marvelous.  There were HUGE chunks of crab all throughout the cake which is highly unusual, usually it's a lot of cake & a little crab.  . . For dinner we ordered shrimp scampi with alfredo noodles (which he loved) and I ordered the pan seared chicken.  The chicken was about 1 1/2  inches thick but it was so juicy and tender it just melted in my mouth.  We also ordered the sides of a chopped salad & lobster macaroni & cheese.  Both of those were delicious.. . Then, because it was my husband and I's anniversary, when we were done with our food, they brought us a complimentary piece of 6 layer lemon cake.  I am not a fan of lemon anything, but this is absolutely scrumptious!   I wanted to order another piece to go but I don't think my thighs & butt would have liked that very much.. . The service was just as fantastic as their food.  I would go back in a heartbeat.
This is my go-to Las Vegas steakhouse.  It was recommended to me by a friend and over the years I've been here maybe about five times.  (Pretty much once everytime that I've vacationed in Vegas.)  . . The food is consistent, the steak is very juicy, and everytime I've taken a new friend or family member here, they raved about it after.  Great service, waitstaff very polite and not too overbearing.
Best service-thank you Brandy!, best steak!, best ambience, piano music to relax and enjoy. What more could one ask for? Absolutely nothing! Great dining experience! can not wait for a return visit.
I love visiting high end steakhouse but this one let me down. I'm from San Francisco and I had better steak with lower price. Their fried oyster is really good but the steak was not impressive at all.  Customer services was world class.
Love this place...we started off with oysters and then shared the wagyu tomahawk rib eye and 22oz lobster tail.it was awesome they also came with three sauces which were a truffle sauce, butter, and bernaise pretty expensive though so be prepared to spend some money but it was great!
Dry bone-in ribeye. They sat us in the d cigar room with old carpet and a creepy atmosphere. Save yourself the grief and keep looking.
This is my first time at this steak. We had house salad with balsamic dressing, steaks, mushroom and asparagus as sides, and "chocolate souffle" for dessert. Salad was okay, not bad but nothing special. Steak was good. Perfectly seasoned and tender. The sides were good. . Notice I put "" around chocolate souffle because it was NOT a chocolate souffle, it was a chocolate lava cake. Heavy chocolate cake with melted center and ice cream on the side. It took the kitchen only about 5-7 min to prepare. We were surprised it was that that quick until we realized it was not the actual souffle. We thought they made a mistake so we double checked with the waitress and she said it is a souffle, just not a traditional one. However, there is a big difference between a non traditional  souffle and a chocolate lava cake. Needless to say I was very disappointed. . Drinks- ordered a cocktail and a wine. I say stick to the wine. . Price- very reasonable for a steak house, probably cheaper than other steak houses on the strip. . Service- good. Friendly staff.  Easy to get reservation. . . In a nut shell, good steak, reasonable price, big wine list. BUT- if you are craving for chocolate souffle, you won't find it here.
This restaurant was recommended from a co-worker- OMG the pineapple martinis - you have to get one! the steak was very tasty- I got the filet- highly recommend for quality food in Vegas!
Good stuff.  Excellent ribeye, perfectly seasoned; crab cake was excellent (not deep-fried, so you really get the crab flavors coming through), lobster mac n' cheese was quite good (generous with the lobster, which is nice) and lemon cake was quality (still don't know how we fit that in our stomachs.). . Quality service- loved the staff-signed "happy anniversary" card we were presented with (as well as the label from our bottle of wine.)  . . Got crab cake for free with promotion- sign up for their club, get a free appetizer (and they comped the lemon cake too, as it was our anniversary.)  Price-wise, it's pretty reasonable- we saw far more expensive joints on the Strip with worse reviews.  You can walk here from the Strip pretty easily if you like- a bit ghetto past Koval, but within a mile of Flamingo area.. . And yeah, see that James Bond table.  I almost came, it was that exciting and cool.. . (hyperbole for dramatic effect)
Let's just say I found a new favorite steakhouse when I visit vegas. The decor is amazing and service was top notch. Mastros was great but this place gives you a nice relaxed vibe when you want to get away from the usual vegas non-stop partying. I had the lobster tail and also the tomahawk steak. Two thumbs up !
