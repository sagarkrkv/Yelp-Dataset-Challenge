The service is why I am giving this place 2 stars. The food offered is nothing new when it comes to niche burger joints, the quality and taste were very good I must say. Service both times we've been here however was lacking in sincerity and in execution. We ordered for desert the chocolate/peanut butter Souflee which takes 20 minutes to come out. When that desert came out out other desert hadn't came out yet. Another 15 minutes passed and still no second desert ( Portugese donuts and gelato). When I brought this to their attention and said I no longer wanted the desert then 2 minutes later it came out. I was so upset at that and that there was no apology or explanation so i just payed my bill and left.
I'm middle of theroad on this one. After watching this local joint on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives Guy F. did a great job talking this place up. I think it left me with super high expectations, so I'm trying to be fair here.. . The food itself was really good. I had an entree salad, hubs had oxtail fries. I don't think the portion sizes matched the price tag; after tip $28! I get that you pay for quality ingredients, but on an entree salad I doubt the amount of chicken I was served really justified a $10 price tag considering the portion size.. . I was a little bothered by the lack of description of the dish. My salad for example said: House Salad, description: free-range chicken. Nothing else. What bothered me is I had to ask about dressing, didn't think to ask about what else is in it as house salads are pretty generic. So color me shocked when it came with walnuts. Um, what if I had a severe nut allergy? Don't you think that might have changed my order?. . The atmosphere was... dull. Waitress had 0 personality, the clientele was yuppy-hipster types (not my thing). The place had no personality, just some enlarged photos of Japanese store fronts.. . I don't know. I just didn't get it. 5 star on taste, 2 star on everything else, meet in the middle for a 3 star on yelp.
Gourmet burgers? Heck yes! Thanks Smitcha B. for this recommendation on our weekend trip to Las Vegas. . . First off, you will have to wait for a table. They're always packed here but for very good reasons: Asian fusion gourmet $10 burgers. Worth it when you're visiting Las Vegas or live out there. . . Plentiful appetizers: Oxtail chili fries (delish), roasted duck Chinese rolls (Bao), yes please. . . Gourmet burgers? I don't remember the name of my burger but I think I scarfed it down in a matter of minutes (it was that good). They also have good beers and service here. . . This location off of Windmill is about 5-10 south of the Strip (I-15S).
This place definitely lived up to the hype! The boyfriend and I stopped by at dinner time for our weekly date night, and could not have been more pleased! The food was every bit as delicious as it looked like in the photos, and decently priced. The service was great as well. Our waitress was adorable, I believe her name was Ashley G., and she was very attentive along with the rest of the service staff. I had the spicy miso burger, and my boyfriend had the myiagi-san burger. Both were amazing! I definitely recommend that you stop by this place for your gourmet burger fix rather than braving the strip and racking up a $100 bill for something that leaves you hungry 20 minutes later. We will definitely be back.
Awesome burgers.  The sauces for the sweet potato fries and parmesan truffle fries are the most original sauces I've had.  No boring ketchup here.  We sat at the bar area cause we did not have time to wait for a table.  The bartender/waiter was very polite and professional.  He did a great job taking care of us while being busy with constant drink orders from other waitresses.
The portions and flavors are perfect! Love the Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Mr. Ho Burger and Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries!
When we first discovered this place several years back, it was new, unknown, typically empty, and completely wonderful. Now, due to that darn mystery of social media, everyone knows about it, you have to wait even if you arrive during off hours, but... it is still wonderful! . . They've really kept the quality and fun! We're regulars when we can spend some time in Vegas. Perhaps we'll move to Vegas just so we can eat here more often :-)
Ronin burger was really good.. highly recommend!. Kiki burger was alright.. nothing special for $11.. Truffle fries were good its definitely worth a try.. The oxtail chili fries I thought was overrated.. there was barely any meat and it came out after 3/4 of my burger was already devoured. Honestly.. just go to Wienerschnitzel, order chilli cheese fries and throw an egg over it! After the first couple bites that is exactly what it taste like.. plus you can save yourself $7!. . I usually set in-n-out as the gold standard for burgers with 5 stars because it such good deal.. but if you want gourmet burgers and something different this place is worth a try.
We came here while visiting a friend out here. Omg eat here. It's so fantastic. The salt and pepper garlic fries were super tasty. Me and my friend spilt the Kiki burger and the spicy miso. Both were great. Can't really go wrong with anything in the menu. Hidden gem for sure!
Food is good here but what's up with the servers? You can tell most of them are not fully trained and they just lacked in customer service.
Probably the best burger I've ever eaten! The pork belly buns were succulent an flavorful. The burger was so juicy and the seasoning is spot on for a ban Mai. The fried are excellent and I am so stuffed that I'm going into a food coma now so I think I need to stop typing! A must when you're visiting in Vegas!
I've attempted to come to Bachi Burger the last 3x I've been to Vegas and I FINALLY got to try it this last trip! There's always a long wait and now I can see why. The hype was real. . . We started with oxtail chili cheese fries and truffle fries. Both made my stomach so happy. If that were the only things I got to try this trip I would've left completely satisfied. I'm pretty much a sucker for anything with a fried egg on top. The fries were crispy, the chili was tasty, and the sunny side egg just completed the dish. The truffle fries came with a brown sauce on top. I have not the slightest idea of what it was, but it sure added to my truffle fries experience.. . Also on the list of things I ordered were pork belly steamed buns with the houses sauce on the side. The pork belly was crispy on the sides and had so much flavor! (I'm drooling again...) BF ordered the spicy miso burger medium. It was saucy and messy and just the way I like my burgers. My experience with burgers have always been... The messier they are the happier I am with it. . . They also own the ramen spot next door and you can order ramen if that's more your craving. I can't wait to come back for more oxtail fries.
Oh Bachi - it hurts me to write this review, but I do it out of love!. . I love Bachi's food, burgers, and drinks, but they are seriously losing their edge. I had heard disappointed reviews from my friends and checked it out for myself.. . There was a wait, but that is to be expected at Bachi. My date and I didn't mind eating at the bar like we normally do, but the host told us we couldn't. When we asked why, he said that different managers had different policies, so because we did it last time didn't mean we could do it this time, but maybe we could next time. Seriously? That's weird. We grabbed drinks at the bar while we waited.. . When we were seated, I asked for a cider cocktail, as advertised on their chalk board, but they were out of their draft cider. Ok. Waiter suggested a different drink which I ordered. We waited...waited...waited...our food finally came - but my drink still had not come! My date ordered a beer when our food arrived and called attention to the fact that I still didn't have my drink. The waiter said it would be just a minute.. . We were checked on by another employee and mentioned the missing drinks. She said it would be just a minute. . . I did finally get my drink, which was yummy, halfway through my burger.. . -Long wait. -Inconsistent policies about where people can eat. -Keg out. -Bad service. -Getting a drink after getting my food. -No apology or acknowledgment. . Bachi - I would have ordered another drink and dessert, but I didn't even get to finish my drink - what gives? Please return to your former 5star glory!
Stopped by this place after my friends that I was with in Vegas wanted to go after seeing it on Diners Drive ins and Dives.. . The funny thing was only one of us actually ordered a burger, but the ox tail chili fries, which were featured was really good.  Definitely a must.  I got the spicy chicken with some rice and onion rings.  The onion rings were amazing.  I could have easily have eaten another order, by myself.  Also a must.  The chicken was good as well.  It hit the spot for me that day.  My friends each ordered the buns, one with duck one with pork belly.   The burger looked good and my friend said that it was pretty good.  I also got a milk tea with boba.. . They seemed to have merged with the Ramen place next door (which is how i was able to get some rice with my chicken) so there were items on the menu that were not something you would expect at a burger place.. . We were there on a Friday at lunch time and we did wait for a bit.  There were quite a few people waiting in front of us for a weekday.  Once we were seated, service was great.
Drop your phone, stop glancing at Bachi's Yelp photos, shut the front door (quoted from Triple D) and order the RONIN burger. Have it done medium-rare. The Ronin burger left us wanting more. . . We also ordered the Miyagi-san burger. My friend likes it done medium and it wasn't as up to par and as savory as the Ronin. It looked excellent in presentation though.. . The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries is a must get! It's a great item to share among 3-4 buddies. The part I liked most was the fried egg that they top the fries with. Genius.. . In the span of our less than an hour savory visit here, we were helped by at least 4-5 waitresses/waiters. Everyone is so nice and attentive! The best experience I've had at a burger joint. (i.e. my friends and I were failing horribly at taking an #oscarselfie and a very kind waiter immediately rushed to our assistance at full speed. So very kind and extremely attentive! Thank you so much, everyone at Bachi!
I went to this joint back in feb 2014 and was the first of several highly-anticipated-first-timers.  Rumor has it the place was feature on "diners, drive-in, n dives" (I'm sure I got the name of the show with Guy F. wrong)... I will only review what my hubby and I had and experienced.. Service - 5/5. since we were one of the early arrivers: ordered, ate, and paid the tab all within 45 min. Fries with truffle and aioli sauce - 5/5. damn, it's good and fresh off the fryer.. Sweet bun with roast duck and sauce - 4/5. it was only good.  I had better at authentic Chinese restaurants.. Shogun burger (my other half's breakfast of the day) - 10/5. YES, 10/5!!! IT WAS THAT DAMN GOOD.  I was only lucky to stole a bite out of the shogun while my hubby was bz with his phone researching our next destination of the day. The $25 shogun is worth every penny! It is worth a trip back to this place just for the burger. . Vietnamese ice coffee - 4/5. Usually when I'm hungry, everything should be better, but this didn't do it.. . Overall, because of the shogun burger and the estimated mean, I gave it all the stars it deserve.  If the joint opens one up in northern Cali with the same or higher standard, I would never dine there, instead I will quit my job so I can work there as many days as I can to eat the mouth watering burger daily;
Bachi takes burgers to a whole new level! Oxtail chili cheese fries are tasty! Although Johnny prefers the truffle parm fries -which are also amazing!  The shogun burger is my go to burger, but today I decided to try the miyagi-San burger and it's was yummy! The chili mayo paired with the grass fed wagyu beef with furikaki and onion rings were a tasty treat.  Definitely try this burger :) . . Honestly for me, nothing beats the shogun burger. Foie gras and wagyu pair together so wonderfully! The presentation alone is executed exceptionally.  The first bite is heavenly. Juicy. Flavorful. Surprising. Yes I am still talking about the shogun! If you got the extra cash to fork up $26 for a burger do so! It sounds like a lot for meat slapped between 2 buns, but it's well worth it! . . Overall a nice modern style restaurant with attentive staff! Clean. Cohesive. Prompt. Great service and always smiling faces!!!!
Barely warm warm food, below average service, truffle fries bland, steamed pork belly rolls bland, sausage appetizer barely warm by the time it was served, did I mention below average service...that is being gracious.  Based on the menu and prices, I expected great food, above average service. Between each course I ordered, the waitress took the dirty fork and knife and placed it on the table...nice mustard stains...I cleaned the mess for her as she was oblivious.   . . The people next to my table sent a burger back two times before it was medium well as requested by the lady.  They asked for a manager...while apologetic, she said the staff should do this, that, whatever, apologized again, said the staff really should have done better, but it seems to happen,  Sorry.  Come back again.. .  I had to ask three times for the waitress to bring a glass for a beer.  The bill was dropped off before the dessert arrived, three people hovered six times to see if the bill was signed while eating dessert.  I spent $45 + tip for one person and did not receive anything beyond Denny's level of service.  . . The Portuguese donuts were very good...the only thing I tried that was up to par.  Great concept, lousy staff training and execution.  A seriously poor execution...and the place was at about 20% capacity, plenty of staff awaiting a dinner rush....they should be in a training refresher meeting  before the rush hit.  I wanted to like it.  Three stars is really 2.5.
I'm writing this review as a long time customer who will never return.  I've been eating here a couple of times a month since they opened. At first I used to go in with my family and friends, but eventually the service sucked so bad I started taking my food to go.  No big deal, as I live two blocks away, and I still loved the food. . . Recently they instituted a policy that you had to give a credit card number to place a to go order. That's right folks, you have to give your personal financial information to a nameless stranger over the phone for...a cheeseburger.  Ridiculous. . . I often pick up burgers on my way home from work, so I just told them I couldn't give a cc number since I was driving.   They were often cautiously polite, asking for reassurance that I would actually show up...for a cheeseburger.  Tonight I called as usual, and the young lady on the phone refused to take my order.  "If you're already on your way here, then why don't you just order when you get here?" Oh, really?. . Look, I'm not going to knock the food. Despite all of the poor service and B.S., I've still been eating here for three years. It's that good. But I'm going to miss it. It's not worth it anymore.  . .  I've been in the restaurant biz for twenty years, fifteen of them in Las Vegas. I know how these things work, and I can tell you that the flaws of this business are the fault of the ownership. I'm guessing it's owned by a chef, because the food, concept, and consistency of product are great. But they are clueless about how to run the front of the house. Lack of training, no supervision, (I've eaten here dozens of times and never seen anyone resembling a real manager) and ridiculous policies that no one with a clue about customer service would implement. . . It's too bad. I'll miss it. But I won't return.
Too much hype, in my opinion. The place was fun and busy! I really did have a good time here, but I honestly felt like I've had much better burgers before. I love their creativity though! I'll still come here again, but it isn't the best I've ever had. . . I ordered the oxtail fries with my family. This dish was the restaurant's saving grace for me. These fries were crisp and the chili was tasty and meaty! Sooooo incredibly good, but fries aren't supposed to be what makes a burger place. . . I got the Kalbi Burger. I ordered my kimchi on the side since I wanted to avoid it overpowering my burger. I'm glad I did because that kimchi was disappointing to me. Their kimchi is too sweet in my opinion, not up my alley. The burger was alright. I really liked the soft bun, but the patty was just okaye. What I was impressed with were the size of the burgers, since all the pictures make the burgers look smaller than they really are. I was really full after I finished, but it was just an okay burger to me. Maybe everything just didn't come together for me because in writing this review, I feel like the burger sounds special and promising, but that's not really what I was left feeling.. . The service was nice though! Every one was very quick to pick up any trash. The place was very clean even though it was so busy. . . Eh, give it a try for yourself. It is worth a try.
I read all the reviews & decided to take my husband. We LOVED it! We started with ox tail chili cheese fries & they were delish! I don't remember which burgers we got, but we both loved them. We will be going back the next time we're in Vegas.
The Mr. Ho and Miyagi San burger is out of this world! By far the best burger i've ever had. The bread is so soft and lightly toasted. The burger is big and juicy! With a side of oxtail chili cheese fries and a glass of strawberry lemonade, i can easily say I've had the best of the best. Can't wait to go back to this place.
Delicious burgers and milkshakes, friendly staff, AWESOME music selection (EDM lol). This place is a must-try!
Favorite burger.
Great service and amaaaazing burgers! The taste and combinations are spot on! . I had the Ronin burger and I became it's master! Nom Nom nom!. My friends got the Kiki burger and loved it!. . The meat is soooo tender and melts in your mouth, the perfectly toasted sweet buns and tasty aoli's are the perfect match for these fusion burgers!. . Can't wait to come back, will defiantly be a stop before going back to LA anytime I'm in Vegas
I'm dinging this place because the front of house is absolute trash, the food is wonderful but twice in a row now they have lost our place on the waiting list and seated 3+ parties that came in after us before and then when I inquire I watch the host stare at a bunch of illegible chicken scratch and pretend he knew where our name was there is no reason there should be a 45 Minute wait on a Monday next time Ill just go elsewhere which is a crying shame because the food is wonderful. Edit: Chris is an awesome waiter the review is in no way a reflection of the service he provided sit in his section if you can get seated!
The burgers are delicious! Also I love the sweet potato fries. Can't wait to go back!
By far the best burger I have ever had. Its a hidden gem that everyone needs to visit.
Fun Asian fusion burgers off the beaten path of the Las Vegas Strip.. . // FOOD // .      + Oxtail Fries: Believe the hype. Gooey fries topped with tender bits of oxtail.      + Pork belly bun: Not NYC's Momofuku or Ippudo worthy, but a decent version. .      + Kiki burger: Topped with a variety of different mushrooms and has a sweet finish with the sweet onions. The burgers look small, but are so thick, that you definitely get full. .      + Miyagi-San: Onion rings and a fried egg? Heaven. . . *Tip: For you Southern Californian-ers, Bachi Burger is coming to Sawtelle on the westside!
Second visit, if you worship great burgers then try it out. Some of the favors might not be for everyone but they work for me. Fresh, fast, fun and fantastic. Having tried the calamari, the sweet potato fries and several of the burgers I love their food.
ok ive been here twice so far and both times ive been very satisfied..both times i got the ox tail chili fries which is a must must try..its sooo good..the first time i made my own burger which was good but i wanted to try one of their specialty burgers..so this time around i tried the Ronin burger which was awesome..the meat is so juicy and tasty and the toppings were spot on..I will definitely be back and back and back!!
Just got here and you can no longer eat at the bar....bummer for a single person. A waste of unused space tonight. Also waitress knew NOTHING about the beer selection. Asked for my regular selection of arrogant bastard and it took her ten min to tell me they did not have it tonight. She knew nothing about any other beer. Finally got a beer after eating my meal. Not good. Burger ok but not so good without a beer!
Bachi Burger was recommended to us by a colleague and since it was on the way from Las Vegas, my friends and I decided to stop by. It was so busy that the wait was 45 minutes so we ended up just ordering to-go. But even the to-go took 30 minutes. At that point we just wanted to leave and go home. I ordered the regular bachi burger and it was alright. I wouldn't say that it is a must have. With the price I paid, I'd rather go to In N Out and have a whole combo with a drink and fries honestly. Maybe it was because we ordered to-go instead of sitting down for the meal and having drinks as well, but I think Bachi Burger is just okay.
I had originally heard about this place from the food networks 'Diners,Drive-ins and Dives' tv show. This place was a bit out of the way on our trip to vegas but it was worth it. The service was really great and we were a group of 6 so they gave a lot of good menu suggestions. We all ordered something different (not on purpose) and we were all satisfied when we left. I ordered the shogun burger which was really goodand was extremely filling on its own. I shared the truffle fries with a friend just to see what they tasted like and i was not disappointed, i recommend them. Overall a great dining experience and DDD was right again.
So we tried Bachi Burger finally, and I have to say that the burgers are tasty, but a little over-priced for what it is.  The buns are delectable, and the meat definitely is a higher grade of meat, but overall the a-la-carte pricing makes you wonder about your pocket book compared to other burger joints.. . Definitely a great idea made off of the Asian fusion with burgers though. . . It probably doesn't help that the to-go isn't packaged as nicely as say... Chilis and thus you feel that the to-go crowd doesn't get quite the same service as those inside the restaurant.. . You'll run about $15 a person or so without drinks.. . Burgers are $7-15, and if you want fries, another $3-6.   My suggestion?  Always get medium to medium rare. The well-done wasn't done all the way through (some pink) and it looked like they charred some of the outside which meant the heat was too great to cook the insides before the outside burned.. . Don't get me wrong, it's great food, but getting it to-go found a less than heartening experience considering.
I've been wanting to go here for a while, so when I had the chance to go whilst in Vegas for a short 22-hour stint, I made sure this place was on my list.. . Oh, I am so glad we waited the 30 minutes or so to get in here. We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, onion rings, a couple of Miyagi-San burgers and a Ronin.. . I don't know about the Ronin, but my Miyagi-San was freaking delicious! And the oxtail fries were not a letdown. I cannot wait to go back.. . The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because I wanted to order a drink from their menu that's behind the bar and the waitress told me that the menu was obsolete. Weird. Maybe that should be taken down?
I'm so obsessed with Bachi Burger that I got my friends obsessed with it too. My sister visited me and she loved it so much that we went here two days in a row... Wow, that's just another level of embarrassing, dedication, love and obesity. I'm glad the staff was different!
I had the Ronin. He had the Black and Green. The house salad was exceptional with the orange vinegar dressing. Yum!  The citrus dipping sauce that came with the sweet potato fries was really good. The pineapple ketchup with the regular fries was to DIE for!  Both burgers were very well done. We will go back. A little pricey for burgers, but I wasn't mad.  Ambiance felt a little rushed and the waiters didn't inform us of much for being first timers. Seats aren't the most comfortable. If you are craving a burger, this is the place to go. Of you want just an ordinary burger, don't. Coffee mint shake with vodka was good. About $76 with tip.
I love all things oxtail,so I was excited to try their oxtail chilly fries. It was ok but the strong and salty flavor of the chilly overcome the delicate taste of the ox tail. That was a small let down for me. One order of the fries was enough to feed both us. We also got the Kiki burger which is excellent and banh mi burger which is ok. I eat tons of Vietnamese sandwiches everywhere. I will save my money and get a real banh mi else instead. I will come back and try more burgers and the truffle fries along with dessert since they look very good. Bottom line: good quality food and hip place.
My husband and I love Bachi !  The food is always on point. Hubby always gets a burger and I always get the Bachi fish. This sandwich is so amazing. I would never have ever ordered it on my own (cod doesn't excite me, as I'm filipina and enjoy more "interesting" fish than just fish stick fish), but I went with a friend and tried a bite. I was sold ever since.  I either get the Bachi fish or the duck buns. . . A locally owned, small business bakery (Lelysee) does the buns and they are outstanding!. . . I like this location so much better than the Sahara location, but service is always very slow (worse at Sahara). But, I would rather go to eat great food with mediocre/bad service than vice versa!!
I don't know how the food is because the service was so poor from the front desk girl, we decided to leave instead. She was extremely rude from the start and even took 2 calls while we waited to ask her about the takeout wait time. She did not acknowledge us, and by the time she did she already had an attitude. They need to learn a thing or two about customer service.
Gotta love the gourmet burgers with an Asian twist. Actually got my pal and her friend from Chicago to try the place and it passes the "Chicago Test"...being that everyone I know from there is picky about food...Chinese sausage, 3 kinds of mushrooms or maybe Korean BBQ and Kim chi on a burger sound weird? Maybe but it's REALLY GOOD STUFF
My friend recommended this place.  Bomb.com!  Only bad thing was after realizing how awesome the food looked and smelled, I asked to move to a bit larger table to accommodate all the food that was coming our way.  Overall, still worth small wait.
Oh Bachi, if this were 6 months ago you would've been a 5. But you've kind of let yourself go a little... maybe you're getting too comfortable? . . Anyway Bachi Burger is one of those foodie locations that all my friends seem to want to try when they visit Vegas and I usually do highly recommend it to visitors. The restaurant is on the small side, very casual, and filled with tons of modern angry panda art. Their menu covers a huge variety of Asian cultures and flavors in a fusion format combined with classic American burger options such as bacon and fried onions. Generally sweeter than salty. If you really want to get fancy feel free to slap on a side of foie gras though. They have a nice selection of beverages and craft beer as well. . . Things I like: Spicy Miso burger, KiKi's burger (underrated but I love the mushrooms and bacon and gruyere), oxtail fries, sweet potato fries, Hitachino Nest white ale. I haven't met a burger I didn't like! . . Things I dislike: My waiter - he was awkward and cracked a "Ho" joke, regarding "Mr.Ho's Burger", to a party of Chinese people one of which actually had the last name Ho. It was way more weird than offensive. My burger has been undercooked the last two times so I started ordering it more well done yet it still comes out equally undercooked. I hate asking people to take things back but when they do take your burger they return it to you with the same bun and patty but new toppings. I've never been to a restaurant where they've done that and it seems strange. Parmesan fries are slightly off too lol.. . Overall yeah I'd still come back and hope I didn't get the same waiter and that my burger is cooked to a nice correct medium rare. When they do get it right THAT IS A TASTY BURGER doe.
Great burger, and management handles things in a very professional manner!
Well this place is only 3 miles from my house so I finally succumbed to the hype and additionally had a burger craving.  I arrived only 20 minutes after they opened and they were already busy with two large groups; one all male tourist group and a large family group with many little ones.  . Please remember that Bachi Burger also operates the Ramen restaurant next door so the hostess asks if you are their for Ramen or Bachi Burger.  This is kind of strange because when you are seated (which was right away) they give you both menus.  Hhmm!!!. Once seated I was greeted by my server Dan who was very attentive and informative.  My water glass was consistently refilled and the staff busing the tables was excellent. So why no 5 stars.  Well, I ordered the salted caramel sundae and was told that they have no marshmallows so the sundae wasn't available.  Ok, if it was 1am after a busy day I would buy that explanation but not 20 minutes after opening on a Friday.  Bad supply planning....  :(. However, they redeemed themselves with the quality and execution of my lunch.  I ordered the Spicy Miso burger with a side of truffle parmesan fries.  I asked for my burger to be cooked medium and it was excellently done with a nice warm red center and one of the freshest tasting burgers I have had since my recent In n Out burger experience.  The burger was spiced well, and the soft cooked egg added so much umami taste to the experience.  The fries were thin and crispy and not overwhelmed by the truffle sauce and the spicy aioli to dip the fries in was fragrant.  Overall the food was perfect and I will be back again next time to try their steamed bun offerings which looked awesome as I saw a few go by my table.. Despite the hectic pace of the restaurant I had good service with a caring attitude and never was rushed.  Dan was a great server and I appreciated his efforts.
We had the oxtail chili cheese fries with egg, Miyagi-San and the Shogun burger, along with Portuguese fried donuts. My beverage was the lychee milk tea with boba. . . I think if you advertised oxtail chili cheese fries the "oxtail" should be the main focus. In this case it wasn't. What we got was barely-there shredded oxtail meat in a stew of chili smothered over fries and topped with an egg. The chili was good for what it was but the oxtail meat did not shine.. . The Miyagi-San burger was very flavorful. I liked it an would probably get it again. . . The Shogun burger had interesting and complex flavors. I don't think any one thing really shined. I could've have done without the poached pear. It sounded good on paper but it was just over-kill. The meat patty had a sweet teriyaki sauce and that was plenty sweet on its own. The frois gras was an interesting touch but it had the same texture of the poached pear. I'm not sure how frois gras is traditionally cooked but I would've wished mine was cooked a little more firm and salted more to counter the sweetness. I honestly think the burger was a whole lot of "too much". Frois gras... Unagi... Poached pear... Wagyu beef patties... All wonderful on its own and maybe it should be enjoyed that way. I wouldn't pay $26 for this burger if I can enjoy one of their $13 burgers just as much if not more.. . If you're accustomed to drinking milk teas and boba. I would say the lychee milk tea was sub-par. If the idea is new to you, it's a cool thing to try but KNOW there are plenty of better places out there to get the same thing. . . Our food came out extremely late and our server was very apologetic and comped our drinks and dessert. I was appreciative but unfortunately that was my first experience.
Really there should be two ratings - the vegetarian (two stars) and the carnivore (five stars).. . The vegetarian burger is mushy.  Although it has decent flavor, the tofu and breaded eggplant on the bun added nothing but volume.  If I said I ate half, that would be stretching it.. . The Kiki burger with wagu was killer, according to our meat eater.. . The fries were delicious, sundried tomato dip and pineapple ketchup added flavor.. . Waiter attentive, but rang up my check $25 over - and admitted he had done the same thing before!  SO WATCH THE CHECK.
My hub and I have had this place on our list for over a year, came once before but wait was ridiculous, so we went next door to Shoku Ramen and we loved it. Anyway, we came back tonight, place is packed, hostess guy said 35 minutes so we said cool, but can we just eat at the bar? No! We don't serve food there, and mind you it has about 12 seats and no one was sitting there. Well, ok , then we will have a drink there and wait. So we have to order a drink over this stupid glass wall, and who knows why, something about a sushi bar, blah blah blah, makes no sense, especially since we work with the health department on restaurants opening and have never ever heard of this dumb partition, anyway, what a total waste of space for a place this busy, they could have turned tables like crazy if they would just serve some dang food at this bar!?!?  So after about 2 drinks each and forty minutes later and no one leaving their tables, we pay our bar tab and are about to leave but the hostess man says, our table is ready! Ok what the hell, let's just stay and see what the hype is about.....waitress comes over and I say quickly he will have the black & blue burger, and I'll have Mr. Ho's, and the truffle fries. Food comes about 20 min later, and the truffle fries are ok, some brown goop on about 5 fries, no truffle flavor, and they look like McDonalds fries but not nearly as good...then we get our burgers. My burger was on a purple bun, and I thought it was blueberry so I ask the waitress, she says it's taro, ok so what's that, and she says some thing called taro, it grows out of the ground, mmm whatever. It is a good burger, interesting to say the least, cooked perfectly, hubby said his burger was great but he won't be back due to the wait. I say fix the bar issue which is valuable wasted space, and suggest people sit on the patio which we didn't even know was an option.
1 Word: WOW. . . This place was incredible. . . I have heard about this place a bunch of times but never had a chance to check it out. Finally went yesterday for lunch and I cannot wait to go back again. Make sure you have an appetite because these burgers are the real deal. . . I was starving and order the Parmesan fries an Kiki's burger- easily one of the best burgers I have ever had. . . Everything was perfect-so fresh. My friend ordered the spicy miso burger and that was delicious too!. . I will definitely be back and recommend this to friends.
Do not eat here! Food poisoning went to emergency room! We were so excited to eat here the food was good on the way "in" but went to emergency room for food poisoning do not eat here!
My favorite burger place!! Too bad, it's all the way in Vegas...I get the miyagi burger, comes with crispy onion and an egg! I love that the buns are hawaiian buns, it adds the perfect amount fi sweetness. The oxtail chili cheese fries are to die for!! It is a MUST if you're going to eat here!
Wow the reviews were on point! This place really hits the spot! I am not normally a burger person but I was craving one and I have only heard good things about this place so I decided to try it out and I might even go back tomorrow lol really really good!!! Fresh juicy and cooked to perfection! Make sure you get avocado on top! Yum!
We took a taxi out to come visit this place and it was well worth it. . We had three burgers. . Oxtail chili fries . Spicy miso. Miyagi San grass fed Waygu . Kiki . . Of the 4, by far, oxtail fries was amazingly good. I love oxtail and this was a great take on it! . . As for the burgers, I really enjoyed the Kiki the best. The mushrooms and the sauce had a lot of flavor. . . The one they sell the most was the miyagi, which was good, the crunch from the onion rings were good, and the flavor of the yolk mixed well. . . Spicy miso for me was just another burger. The shredded lettuce overpowered the whole burger, and wasn't the most pleasant over power flavor. . . The burgers were really big. Between three people this was more than enough food, I think 5 people could have split all this food and had a good bite of each and still be just full. . . I think for flavor, I still like Unami burger for the juiciness of the meat, but I think you get more value and more uniqueness for what you pay.
This is a place that I love to take tourist since it is a Vegas thing.  I love to watch other people eat things that make them stop talking so they can enjoy their food.  Bachi Burger does this over and over.  The Bahn Mi is incredible, along with the pickles and the oxtail chili cheese fries and really any of the other burgers.  The shakes are ridiculous but filling.  The one thing that I can say about eating here is when I leave I am always satisfied,
Happy Hour, from 3-6 on weekdays is fantastic. $3 beers and wine, and apps on the cheap. I had a craving for a burger so we picked Bachi Burger because it's close to home. . We ordered off the regular menu. I got the burger with kimchee and it was fantastic! The patty is HUGE, kimchee was good (although I could have used some more spice), and the bun was fluffy and filled with air pockets ready to absorb all the yummy flavors of the burger. I ordered medium rare and the patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare. This seriously hit the spot for me. The BF got a make-your-own burger with lettuce, tomato and an egg. He really enjoyed his burger as well. . . This is a great spot (one I often overlook because it's tucked away in the corner) and I highly recommend it!
Came in to see what all the hype was about. Will never come back. First off, our waitress was irritatingly fake. The food came out quickly, and considering it was a simple order (plain burger with just cheese and bacon) you would think they would get it right the first time. The burger was undercooked and when we sent it back politely the manager brought out a new plate 10 minutes later and informed us they put on new toppings but the burger was the same. I'm in the food industry and this is against health code and severely frowned upon. Not to mention the fact my girlfriend is pregnant and even though we werepolite about the request, our waitress kept staring at us strangely and gave her fake "how is it now?" question several minutes after the manager brought out the new plate...made me paranoid that something was altered to the food. I will be calling in to the health dept also known as my friend "" "" and report them as well as tell everyone I know not to eat at this establishment.
