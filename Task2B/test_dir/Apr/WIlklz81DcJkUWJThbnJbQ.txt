The room was nice enough but the hotel is difficult to access the strip from. You can't really just walk out to the strip from the hotel. It is a smaller hotel and lacks ALOT of the expected extras. there is no restaurant other than a small market cafe  and a Crap errr I Mean Starbucks. A lot missing. Don't believe these other reviews it is NOT a quiet sanctuary from "Crazy" Vegas. Younger partiers coming back early morning ,like everywhere else in Vegas, Drunks passed out in the hallways by the rooms like everywhere else in Vegas, Crowded elevators like everywhere else in Vegas, just no gaming...That is the truth. If you still want to think it is a quiet sanctuary go ahead. We would not stay again for 1 reason and that is simply ACCESS to and from the strip. Even if you do not gamble unless you are going to stay in the VDARA or the immediate hotels surrounding it, you will want access to the rest of the strip.
Spent a Friday and Saturday night here and really loved the hotel. I love that there's no casino and thus no smoking, so it actually smells good when you enter. It's much less crazy, and a nice, relaxing retreat from the party of Vegas, yet it's only steps away from it when you want to resume the insanity. It's really the best of both worlds. I love that it's free valet and that you don't have to walk a half hour through a self park garage, through a casino, to get to the reception desk. We had a painless check-in, were given a great room on the 40th floor with awesome views, including the water shows at the Bellagio next door.. . The rooms themselves are great. They are spacious, modern, and clean. There was a living room, kitchenette, bedroom, and large bathroom. We didn't use the kitchenette at all, though I guess maybe it would be nice if someone was staying for an extended period of time. It almost seemed unnecessary in Vegas, though. It would probably be helpful for families with babies or small kids. Anyway...the room was great. One thing I thought was odd for a 5-star hotel, was that there were no robes in the room. Not a big deal, but it's something I'd expect from a hotel like this.. . The only real negative of the weekend was on Saturday we realized we forgot an important toiletry item and called down to ask if it could be brought up to us. Sure, no problem. We waited for 20 minutes and then called again. They said it would be right up. We waited another 20 minutes - nothing. Finally, we gave up and had to run out to CVS. This was pretty frustrating, again for a 5-star hotel. For this kind of place you would expect much better customer service (ie: not waiting 20 minutes for an item you request, and if they do make an error and need to be called a second time, at that point make sure that the item gets there). This left a bad taste in our mouth. Even when we went out for the night and came back, we were half expecting the item to be in our room when we got there, since we were assured twice it was "on its way," but there was no sign of it. We also had a slightly longer wait than what I would think is normal for our car from the valet when we checked out on Sunday. They don't have the kind of valet where you can call down for your car so it's waiting when you get down there...you have to go down yourself and show the ticket. . . Overall, we really loved how new and clean this hotel was, and how comfortable our room was. That being said, what would have been an excellent stay was put off by the poor customer service. I would consider staying here again if I got a good deal, but I'd be extra sure to bring EVERYTHING I needed because you can't rely on them to bring anything to your room, no matter how long you wait or how many times you call.
LOVE THIS HOTEL!!!! LOVE THE NON-SMOKING FACILITY!!!! I LOVE HOW THEY HAVE FULL KITCHEN APPLIANCES!!!!!. . I got the City Corner Suite on the higher floor. The room was great, very fancy. It looked more like a luxury condo than the hotel. Staff was nice when I checked in, gave us $50 dining credit which I used for the in-room dining. The swimming pool isn't that big but fine because there weren't that many people. There no casino but you can just walk 3 mins to ARIA to play, if you need a quiet place to stay in Vegas, this would be it. It felt very upscale, and it's more of a family hotel than a party hotel.. . Will definitely go again if the send me a promo email again, because without it, the rate is little bit on the stiff side than the other similar hotels.
Vdara is a beautiful Hotel. I enjoy any Hotel in Vegas that doesn't smell like cigarettes and alcohol. Unlike others, our view looks over a parking garage and The Rio was in the distance, so sadly our view sucked. So be aware, that you won't get a great view every time. Rooms are big, clean, and the bathtub is perfect for a soak after a day of non stop shopping. The only con is that you have to do a bit of walking in order to get on the strip. Either you can pass over a walkway that goes into the Bellagio, and then out to the strip, or you can walk across Valet parking to the Aria and walk through the Aria to get to the strip. On day 1 it didn't seem that bad of a walk, but by day 2 and 3 I dreaded that walk. Would we return? Um, Maybe? It wouldn't be my first choice every time though. Caesars is still my number 1.
My husband and I came to the Vdara for our 3 year wedding anniversary.  We had stayed at the MGM Signature 2 previous times and were looking for something new and exciting.  Let me tell you, the Vdara is it!!!  I loved it!. . First let me start by saying that we did upgrade from the Deluxe Suite to the Vdara Suite.  The room was soooo much bigger than what we were paying for at the Signature.  For the same price we and 1 full bathroom with a huge soaking tub, a half bathroom, and HUGE kitchen with room for 6 people to dine, a nice size living room with it's own flat screen tv & a large bedroom with another flat screen tv and very comfortable king size bed.. . The refrigerator kept all our drinks & food nice and cold so we didn't need to continually leave the suite to get something refreshing, it was there waiting for us.  Also, the microwave came in very handy.. . The room service was perfect.  The cleaning crew were very efficient and did an EXCELLENT job keeping our room clean & neat.  Bed was made everyday. Could not ask for better service.. . When we came home I noticed I was missing a Coach purse which happened to have my ID in it.  I called Vdara and they passed me to lost and found and they already had it there waiting.  They sent it to me UPS and no additional charge to me.  . . I will say, the only thing I did not like about the Vdara is one day my husband & I were walking back to our room, headed to the elevators and a young lady that worked at the Vdara asked to see our room key before she would let us continue to our room.  We had never had this happen at any hotel before and did take a little offense to it.  We had already been there 3 nights and a lot of couples walked straight to the elevator without the young lady asking to see their room keys.  Not really sure what this was all about but we did NOT appreciate it.  I don't understand why you would ask 1 couple and no one else.  Maybe it was because we were not Asian like 90% of its guests????  That's the only thing I can come up with.....
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS HOTEL. Initially intended to be condos on the strip, the Vdara gives you all the good about Vegas- glitz, glam and luxury without having to trudge through the smoke infested casino and forgetting which tower you're staying in. . . Spacious rooms that are the pentacle of elegance and modern sophistication, I personally feel that the Vdara offers the most amenities from your bank. Our corner suite was equipped with a full size refrigerator, Keurig brewing system, 4 range stove and table dining for 4. . . The large king bedroom and pull out queen sofa bed house 5 of us girls for the weekend. . . Wedged in the center of city center in between the Aria Resort and Bellagio, we were right in the center of all the action without having to endure all the usual fuss and bustle that comes with staying on the strip.. . This was my second time staying here and it still remains my hotel of choice when visiting Vegas.
My love affair with Vdara was re-ignited this past trip. This was our 3rd time staying at this ultra-hip, luxurious, and four diamond hotel & spa. Each time I visit this hotel, I'm blown away by their high standard of care, first class customer service and impeccable taste for the ultimate luxurious hotel & spa experience. The biggest draw for us was the fact that this hotel is a non-smoking & non-gaming establishment so you NEVER get the smoky, yucky feel of most other hotels and it sets for a relaxing, spa-like feel when you enter the hotel instead of the noisy, Vegas feel. . . ROOMS: all rooms are suites that resemble more like a hip NY bedroom apartment. The decor is ultra-hip with shades of brown, green, and splashes of various modern colors. Depending on which room view you get (city view overlooking the City Center buildings, pool view, or lakeview overlooking Bellagio fountains), they are all pretty amazing. TIP: you can always ask for a specific view upon checking in. All three visits, we have requested for a "nice" view and have thankfully been given free upgrades based on availability. Two flat screen TVs  in each room (one facing bedroom) and the other in the living room).  All suites come with its own kitchen (fully operable glass top, refrigerator (no freezer compartment though), microwave and a cute dining table. Each room allows for two complimentary water bottles as a basic service to the guests. Note: there are no coffee-makers, dishes, or silverware but these can easily be requested through housekeeping. . . BEDROOM: Sheets/comforters are standard white and green. Not too fancy or impressionable but definitely feels "laundered" and NOT grimy or dirty. The mattress has a memory foam feel to it so it's very plush and comfortable. However, the pillows are a bit too thick for my husband and I (we can only sleep with very thin pillows b/c we don't want our necks to pop out of our spine). We ended up throwing pillows on floor and sleeping on just the mattress w/o pillows. Rooms are super quiet (no noise from outside can be heard in your room. . . BATHROOM: The bathroom alone earns 2 stars for their chic bathroom tubs/sinks and  well equipped with "green" amenities (paraben/sulfate/gluten free soaps & shampoo/conditioners). Even has a glass weight scale for the health conscious peeps who are counting calories. Feels like you're in a luxury spa! TIP: Call housekeeping to ask for complimentary robes and slippers for the ultimate comfort in your suite.. . SPA: My husband and I opted for a 50 minute couple's massage package that included bath salt scrub and hot stone massages (he opted for deep tissue and I choose swedish). Prior to our massages, we were escorted to a waiting room (men and women were separated) where they had complimentary water/tea/sweets & snack bar. We were thoroughly impressed with the spa amenities, decor, and ambience. Not a cheap excursion but definitely worth every few hundred that you spend in this spa! . . OVERALL: If you want to do Vegas differently (i.e. non-smoking, non-gaming, non-noisy but still be in the midst of Vegas excitement), stay at the Vdara! You won't be disappointed. My rating is the highest I've ever given for any hotel or establishment. Like I said, I have a love affair with Vdara that will continue as long as they continue providing top-notch services and amenities aforementioned. See you at our next anniversary/birthday celebrations...until then, I miss you already Vdara!
Very classy hotel! Probably one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in. I had a deluxe suite over looking the belagio water pool. Beds were extremely comfortable. The room design was very sleek and modern! Great ventilation. The tub was awesome, very deep. And they staff was very polite and professional. Would definitely stay there again if the price is right.
Beautiful non smoking condo-like rooms. Super chic and clean, with your own eat in kitchen!. . We were celebrating my boyfriends birthday. It was his first time experiencing VEGAS. I am a bit of a Vegas junkie so I showed him the spots to go!. . It was both of our first times staying at Vdara, it was beautiful and a bit secluded. Not a far walk to the strip and non smoking without a casino too. This is definitely for the rich families and those who come to Vegas on business.. . Our room was gorgeous and the woman at the front desk was super helpful and kind. She really made us feel important and gave us a room with a beautiful view. . . I would like to stay here again because it was quiet, comfy, and super chic. . . Not five stars because you're forced to valet, not many dining options on site, no convenience store (had to walk to bellagio to get hangover remedies), bar closes early,  and they don't have jacuzzi tubs. :-(. . But definitely nice place to stay.
Highlights: nice rooms, kitchenette, easy access to  Bellagio. . Negatives: pool closes at 6:00 p.m., food is expensive, check in very slow.
Upscale and modern. Trendy. The most sophisticated hotel we stayed so far. I upgraded to a corner suite and the views were stunning. Everything in our suite bespoke of modernistic affluence. The lounge downstairs was excellent as well with really friendly and accommodating staff. No gaming or smoking in this hotel. ARIA is next door for gaming anyway. Valet parking only. Walking distance to the strip and other hotels like Bellagio and Ceasars palace .There's a Tram for a non walking option.
Nice hotel but not perfect.. Pros: fancy and new room, helpful staff, great view. Cons: have to call service to get robes, no indoor access to aria or bellagio, poor quality shampoo
Fantastic:  all suites, contemporary, clean, graciously appointed, friendly and helpful staff, fabulous views and no smoking...what a great option for this California family!  Style straight out of Dwell magazine or Houzz.  Washer dryer and full kitchen. Wish we could hire the designer to update our house.  ;) . . Great tub and views.  Great prices- a private pool-front cabana with flat screen tv, couches and chaise lounges for $125 for the day- very friendly, attentive hosts that checked in every half hour.  . . Loved our stay and can't imagine staying anywhere else as I'm allergic to smoke, gold, and traditional garish Vegas decor.
I stayed here for my husband's birthday weekend in Vegas. It was our second favorite hotel in Vegas besides the Encore. It is an easy walk to the strip, very clean, and very nice. The rooms are very nice. We rented ours from Jet Luxury so we didn't have housekeeping every day which was kind of a bummer. Besides that it was great.
This a desert oasis on the Strip. Need a break from the smoke and noise of a casino hotel but still want to be in the center of the action? This is a little secret. Shhh. Don't tell too many people! . It smells good, . I took a deep breath unconsciously when I went in the lobby.. It's dog friendly.. They have a Starbucks in the lobby.. The rooms are uber modern and clean with great views.. The pool looks awesome.. The views are great.. The valet is free and nice.. The mattresses were a little soft for my back.. Pop down the walkway, through the Aria hotel lobby, you are in the main action again on the Strip.. Totally the way to go.
Beautiful rooms that were intended to be condos. . Loved having a corner suite (811 sq ft) . however, it would have been better to have a higher floor than the 8th. our view was the Bellagio Pool and the Tram which was a bit noisy at night/early morning hours. . . Full kitchen and washer/dryer was a plus. The bed was super comfy besides the pillows.. I wanted to take home the comforter! . . I would have liked the toilet area to have a door so my friend doesn't have to view me while she does her hair or maybe she wanted to? . . The Valet was fast and nice, the bellman was super friendly and helped set up our media output. . . The check in clerk needed a personality and he seemed like he hated his job, he quoted us a $100.00 deposit and ended up charging us a $200 deposit! Thankfully we got reimbursed quickly. . . I walked to the Aria and checked it out, the employees there were so nice and I liked that it had shops, restaurants etc... I think I might stay there in the future, it's also closer to PH and the strip. . . Valet only but you can park at the Aria or Bellagio and walk it. . . Overall this place is solid for it's rooms but their security deposit is ridicules! . . RANDOM FACT:. The Vdara is only 4 years old.
The place is new and clean and provides a cooktop, microwave and small sink apart from the bathroom.  The fridge, if I remember, was filled with drinks, and you were not allowed to put things in there because there was some weight system that indicated whether you took out a drink or not.  So in other words, you cannot use the fridge even to put your leftovers.. . Room was spacious and the pool was nice.  Yes, there is a reflection bouncing off of Aria during a big chunk of the afternoon.  I would suggest swimming in the morning to beat the crowds and for a quiet setting.  Plus, the pool gets murkier in the afternoon...if you know what I mean.. . You really can't ask for a more convenient location minus the premium pricing.  You're a small walk from Aria, City Center and the Cosmopolitan.  The hotel lobby connects you to a passageway to the Bellagio and to the tram that connects you to the west MGM properties.  We ended up just valeting our car once and walked during our entire stay there.. . The market pantry is very convenient.  It's got foods to take back up to your room, frozen foods for that microwave in you room,  offers coffee, pastries and a fulfilling breakfast.  The oatmeal and omelettes were perfect for my wife and me just before checking out.. . Hotel staff was friendly and helpful.  We would target Mandalay Bay in our previous visits, but Vdara has a better location so now it's Vdara that's our primary choice.
Love, love, love this hotel in Vegas!  I definitely will be staying here again if the price is reasonable.  At the time I made reservations they had a spring promotion going on so, I booked the City Suite for a very good deal and it was also my anniversary.  The room was FABULOUS!  It was a panoramic view of the strip, the bathroom was nice and big, bed was soft and comfortable, the kitchen was the perfect size with a fridge that had a built in filtered water system!  So glad we didn't have to buy bottled water there! . I've stayed at Palazzo, Aria, Elara, Planet Hollywood, and Paris in the past and this hotel is the best one of all!
I love love this hotel! It is by far the best hotel I've stayed at in Vegas. It's pretty pricey, but you totally get what you paid for. It is an all suite hotel with a functional kitchen. They provide you all the cooking tools and dining dishes complimentary, just ask housekeeping for them and they will bring them right to your room. This hotel is also conveniently located in the middle of the strip. Walking or free trolley ride distance to neighbor hotels like bellagio, aria, and Monte Carlo.. . Let me mention, this is a 100% non-smoking and casino free hotel. A perfect place to unwind from the hustle and bustle of the las Vegas strip. When visiting the hotel and want to relax, they have a very clean and very relaxing spa. My husband and I got their couples massage and it was heaven! Once you book a spa appointment, you are welcome to use all their spa amenities such as shower, Jacuzzi, sauna, and they have a fully stocked vanity with everything you possibly need after taking a shower. They even have hair styling products and tools to let you do your hair before you leave. . . When you are ready to mingle with everybody else, all the attractions and casinos are only walking distance. No driving required when staying at this hotel, it is at the center of it all. Yes, it may be expensive but it is well worth it!
Very chic hotel. Love it!  It's pricey but it's worth it, even if for one time.  We fit a group of 6 in here..a couple in the bed, one couple on the floor and then another on the pull out sofa bed.  Plus, there's a kitchen area, so you can def mix your drinks and just party it up in your room before heading out.
