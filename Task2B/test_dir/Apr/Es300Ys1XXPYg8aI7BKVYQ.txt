This wasn't my favorite club in Vegas. I just don't prefer deep house which they played for an hour on the night I was there. Then my group that consisted of 7 girls in a bachelorette party decided to leave. . It wasn't our scene but I'm sure it's someone else's.
I think XS has been up and running for a few years now. Circa 2014, B2V Las Vegas, Friday night, David Guetta. Awesome!. . Yes, they have very long lines, the Encore is a classy hotel, so dress to impress here at XS! I think they have three lines: GA (long horrible lines), VIP/Guest lines (lines moved) and pre-sale tickets (YAY, hella fast and short lines). If you're going for a special DJ, make sure you buy pre-sale tickets. It's worth the money and short lines. . . Good EDM music, some hip hop mixed in (depending on the DJ), a good crowd with nice looking people for the most part but EXPENSIVE drinks (yeah...it's Las Vegas). . . XS...nice! FYI..watch out for the stupid TAXI line after the club though..we waited 40-45 minutes in that taxi line to catch a cab back to our hotel! :(
Was told we could be on the VIP lost for my lil sisters wedding. Sounded great... Except they wouldn't let us on the inside of club??  No problem if they told u that??  Too crowded and the shots are 16$.. Really??  Never again. Waste of time.
Holy Customer Service NIGHTMARE.. . WOW. The lack of professionalism the entire staff showed leading up to our reservation followed through to 3 months later when our issue from NYE was not resolved... One word... NIGHTMARE. An all around headache that I would not care to every partake in ever again. . . Please note the actual club itself is gorgeous. However, that doesn't give anyone the right to completely forget any form of customer service. . . LONG story short:. Had a reserved table for NYE.. Arrived at 10:30pm and were given the reserved table for a party of 12 on stage.. 11:30pm - removed from the table with no explanation, sent around trying to talk to the managers to figure out what was happening. Did I mention this was NYE and all happening right before the ball drop?. 11:50 - told the team of 3 that had handled our reservation was not working the night of. WHO CARES! We had emails and confirmations of the reservation. . 11:55 - the option to get a table that fits 4 behind the stage next to the pool when we had a party of 12. So yes, a table that did not fit our group nor was it anywhere near the DJ booth or dance floor.. Basically learned that someone else offered more money for our table so we were booted. We were told we would receive a refund. It is now 3 months after and we are still waiting on the refund. Atrocious. . . In the last of the 23 emails returned back and forth, this was the closing: "Please let me know if you decide to visit again and I will personally make sure your experience is flawless." BAHAHAHA! Right... because that is what we were told when we made our original reservation for NYE. Did I mention we planned this in September? Yes, 3 months of planning down the drain thanks to greedy club managers and owners. . . Big name DJs? Yes. Bottle Service & VIP? Yes. Huge areas to move around? Yes... however, during the high tourist months, they pack them in. Also, if you are in one spot of the club and have to get to the other side and there are crowds... give yourself 20 minutes. Not even joking. . Great sound system? Yes. Fun lights and confetti? Yes. **Absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with in any club around the world. TRIPLE YES.**
XS IS MY FAVORITE CLUB. . . Their promoters are trustworthy and generous, which is hard to say about a lot of other Vegas clubs. They really try to make you feel comfortable and genuinely want you to have fun and enjoy yourself. My promoter, Brent, was the man! He literally walked my girls and I into the club and to a table and gave us a crazy amount of drink tickets. He checked up on us throughout the night to make sure everything was good. And it really was! I had so much fun from 10:30-3:30 it honestly only felt like we were there for 2 hours.. The music was on point! Diplo on mad decent Mondays slapped so hard. He's a great dj!. The layout of the club is super cute! There's a pool outside that offers a great background for photos.. . No wonder why they've won the number 1 club in Vegas so many times!
Sucked! We bought $80 tickets + $80 in four drinks... Spent 1 hour in a terribly crowded club. Was not fun at all...spend $160 on gambling instead. . . P.S. The line for a cab was 30+ minutes. . . Don't oversell tickets assholes. I'm pretty sure that place was "legally" overcrowded.
Horrible! First off bought pre sale to get ahead of the game and the 80$ was not worth it. Got to the door and they send you around the hotel on a treasure hunt to find your entrance. REALLY??? Most of us already had a problem finding the regular entrance. Then you get it and you get drinks, 45 min wait to get a drink. There went my prebuzz. But beware the drinks four vodka red bulls another 80$. Waste mostly red bull. Good luck finding a spot to dance and have a good time there was so many people there that there was no room to breath. Sorry XS you failed 3 bar keeps for 100,000 people you failed!!!!!
I've been to a few clubs on the strip and this was the best! Even better than lights. Sweet layout with inside and outside with fresh air flowing in.  Loved the breeze. Huge!  Popping! Pools and palm trees and lots of pretty lights. Sweet bar and gambling in the middle of the pool.  My wife really liked how much open seating there is outside. We went on a Friday and even the opening DJ Brazzabelle was awesome! DJ MARTIN SOLVEIG was the headliner and he was solid.  Get on promoter Rachel's list so if you get there before midnight guys and girls are free (would have been $35 for guys $25 for girls) and girls get a free drink ticket. The promoter's line was super short. You can text her at 702-557-4160.  She hooked it up!
Our party of 8 was at XS this past Saturday night for table service. Between the bottle minimum and tip, we spent over $2600 (which doesn't include what we also spent at the blackjack tables). We have done table service at many similar Vegas clubs over the years, so this was not a new experience for us in general, but it was our first time at XS specifically.. . CONS. --We arrived at 10 pm, and despite having a reservation, still had to stand in line for 20 minutes. And I didn't have a single memorable encounter with a host - generally they were pretty unfriendly.. --While it was a nice evening to be outdoors, our poolside table was almost as far from the stage and dance floor as one can get.. --The dance floor required some other form of access which apparently our $2600 did not buy us immediate access to. However, our server told us if we wanted to hit the dance floor, we could text our host (even though we had yet to see him at any point during the evening) or we could flag her down and she would get him for us. Which leads to my next point.... --Our server was very friendly and I have no complaints about her personally. However, she was clearly over-assigned or otherwise occupied because we were lucky to see her every 45 minutes. She apologized each time, but it still doesn't excuse the fact that we were paying as much as we were to barely see our server throughout the night (fortunately none of us wanted that dance floor access too badly).. --By midnight, our table area was completely surrounded by people who had paid the minimum cover for access to the club, and they were spilling over into our space.. . PROS. --Blackjack tables were good.. --The weather was nice so it was a good night for a poolside table.. --The music was good.. --Our group of friends has fun no matter where we go, and thanks to 3 bottles of alcohol, we made the most of it.. . This club is clearly trying to be everything to everyone - exclusive table service + large dance club. Unfortunately it's not working.
I have found the Seventh Circle of Hell. . . My buddy & I were in town for the Tool show over at Planet Hollywood, and afterward he insisted we go to a nightclub. He is much more into "that life" than myself, so a night of stuffing face at Boiling Crab and then drinking while playing video poker was not going to cut it. . . I am not a nightclub person. For one thing, I already have a woman. Secondly, I really don't want to put on a collared shirt for anything that isn't a wedding, a funeral, or paying me. Thirdly, I've been to plenty of clubs before and you know who's there? Douchebags. Douchebags and girls who want douchebags to shower them with free drinks and attention. Douchebags with tables. Douchebags in ill-fitting business shirts stained with sweat and scotch. Douchebag hipsters with an abundance of ironic facial hair and enough flannel to knit a shirt for Paul Bunyon AND his ox. . . We arrived via a party van limo - just the two of us, mind you - complete with stripper pole and sound system blaring every homogenized top 20 rap hit that was hot. My friend didn't feel like waiting in the long taxi line at PH, so he hailed this beast for $75 to get us about four city blocks away. . . I should probably mention that he knows we're headed into my own personal kryptonite lair. He bought the $50 tickets to get in, he's buying the beer, he got the cab. I'm acutely aware of the fact he's basically my temporary sugar daddy, but there was no way I was going to actively participate in any of this. . . We arrived to be greeted by a huge line. We waited in that line for 15 minutes before someone explains that we actually need to be in the OTHER huge line. More waiting ensues before, finally, we get inside.... . ...where things got worse. This is a pool, ostensibly, and the large body of water in the middle required extensive navigation in order to reach the bar on the other side. Sensibly, the DJ booth is located right in front of the pool, so in addition to the crowd trying to reach the bar you've also got everyone that's already drunk standing around and gyrating to some degree. The barrier of the crowd was marshaled by a herd of thick chicks standing in thigh-deep water. Hands were everywhere. It must have taken 15 minutes to cross 15 feet of walkway. And we didn't even get drinks at that bar. We walked over to the OTHER bar in the middle, which is where my friend ordered one $11 Bud Light after the other. $11. For a Bud Light. . . We stood around and talked because I had literally no idea what else to do. The girls who were decent looking already had at least a vulture or two hanging around; those that were part of the D.U.F.F. (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) crew clustered together and partied like they didn't give a shit who was watching. . . After an agonizing number of hours (which was probably more like 90 minutes), Avicii came on to a decent amount of fanfare. This was the entire reason my friend came. This is what he'd been chiding me about for the last week. Apparently, this Avicii guy is huge in the DJ world and Encore pays him some ridiculous figure to stand around playing THIS? I know it's not the most original comparison, but half these "songs" sounded like a Transformer taking a shit. And people were eating it up. They were eating up that shit. I felt slightly queasy, though that could have been the pounding my stomach had been taking from drinking all day/night. . . As I'm waiting in line for the bathroom, a guy with an absurdly large, well-coiffed mustache stands in front of me, holds up his fist, and waits for me to return the bump. He then says, "I just saw you here looking good and thought you could use some love." It was, admittedly, kinda thoughtful. . . 2:27a.m. My friend assures me we'll leave at 3:00a.m., but first he needs to hit the head. I wait somewhere nearby. Have I mentioned my phone died hours earlier at the concert? I rarely take my eyes away from the bathroom exit. He never leaves. By the time 3:37a.m. rolls around I've scoured the area A LOT, so I just assume he'll show up at the hotel at some point in time and I leave. Since the taxi line was a good 100+ drunks deep, I walk over to Palazzo, where a cabbie picks me up, offers to take me somewhere for a happy ending massage (not from him), and eventually drops me back at the Monte Carlo - where my dumbass buddy is passed out in bed. I pelt him with Cheerios between eating sloppy handfuls before hitting the sack.
Oh my god. I never knew a Las Vegas nightclub could be so terrible. Why did no one warn me?. . We were on the guest list, so we THOUGHT that meant we would get in free. And to the first, outside section, it did. But to get inside the actual club, we had to pay another $30. WTF. Well we wanted to see David Guetta, so we forked it out.. . When we got inside it was super small, and the dance floor was teeny tiny. The only good thing I have to say about the place was that they allowed us to sit in the big red bottle service booths until someone came for actual bottle service. But everything else, blew. . . We couldn't dance because it got so incredibly crowded there was no room. It was so bad we could barely even get around the club. I got so pissed that I literally started pushing people out of my way. I was annoyed as hell. . . Screw this crap. I will never be back. Even when Zedd is there. not worth it. We left and ended our night at Rose Rabbit Lie, which we love.
Absolutely horrible. We planned this Vegas trip around seeing Avicii here at Xs. He had to cancel for medical reasons, but we were still looking forward to going to the club since we'd heard so many good things about it. I hadn't been to a club in Vegas before so I was expecting an exclusive experience. It was the WORST. Way too many people - you could not even walk. We had to wrestle our way off the dance floor, it was borderline unsafe, not exaggerating. The line at the bar took over 30 minutes. I'm. literally at a loss for words about how shitty this place was. Do NOT waste your time and money here. Tragic.
Not the best club I have been to! Promoters were great we got in with no problems. David guetta was dj and the place was crowded. Took 40 mins just to get a drink in there and if u wanted to dance you either had to deal with people jumping all over you and being smashed into everyone or you would have to dance outside on your own. Other than that the club itself was gorgeous. :)
We paid extra online to avoid long lines for Steve Angelo this Easter Saturday 19 April. We had to go check 5-6 several entry points till we found the right line. Line was long and long. Some folks were passing thru short cuts assisted by the wanna be gang looking staff members. Waited in line 50 mins. Line was not moving because of short cutters. We asked if this is the line for people who paid extra to avoid it. They said yes. We asked how people pass thru short cuts. They said you be courteous to us, meaning tip. I asked how much. Staff without a name badge said whatever you think appropriate. I was already mad to learn about this possibility after 50 mins. I was respecting the line & people waiting as a decent person. Anyway  the conversation between the staff without a name badge soliciting tip turned out nasty. Obviously they treat the people in line like a sheep. It is not whatever you think appropriate. It does have a minimum price. $20. We got inside after purchasing the cheap spirit of the unnamed staff member. It is no different than bribery. I had to bribe first time in my life thx to XS. Inside is full of cigarette smoke. Went out side. All the smoke was being vented outside. By that time i got used to smoke. How was music? One or two moments that I thought was picking up the mood and spirit. Other than that way below my expectation. 3 out of 10 is my score for the performance of Steve Angelo. Would I ever go again. No way. I won't reward their bad bad service and attitude for less than average quality of music.
I went to Las Vegas for my birthday with my husband, my cousin, and her fiance last weekend. I wanted us to go to a nice nightclub for our last night in Vegas, which was a Monday night. I was referred to a promoter by the name of Michelle from Viva Las Guest List. As many of us know, to get "comped" at a nice nightclub with two guys is not always easy or you get the run around. Michelle put my party on the XS guest list and confirmed our attendance an hour before via text. We arrived at XS nightclub, went straight to the promoter line, they checked my name, comped all 4 of us in for free and my cousin and I (females) received 2 free drink tickets. We didn't wait on the line and went directly in. The club is clean, the service is great, the drinks were strong and not watered down, even the "free" ones. It was a Monday night so mostly house/techno music. Nice crowd, not the usual young and rowdy group you can come across at a club in Vegas. All in all we had a great time and was impressed with XS. A special thanks to Michelle for the smooth hook up. If you are looking for a great promoter, hit her up! (908) 770-3570.
XS screams classy. Wynn properties are one of the best on the Las Vegas strip. Always a good time. Big celeb DJs every weekend. . Girl glist is great. I always go with a big girl group so never an issue getting in. . . The giant outdoor patio is great to go back and forth since the inside gets insanely packed. Dance floor is a no zone for me since you have to fight to get through. No thank you.
XS was probably the best night club inVegas that i've been to, and that was on a monday!
It was my first club in Vegas (my first club ever actually). Thanks to my awesome aunt who works at the Wynn she got my two friends and I in for free. It's got a really great vibe but it really depends on the DJ sometimes. There's a nice outdoor area by the pool. The dance floor isn't too big. There's not much seating if you don't have a booth reserved. It was a fun first clubbing experience. I recommend trying it for a night, and make sure to go on a night you'll enjoy the DJ.
The first time I went to XS, I hated it...We were a group of 6 and paid $200 to skip the long 2 hr wait line.  This club was PACKED.  Granted, we were there during the first few months of opening.  But I tried it a few more times the past 2 years and enjoyed it a lot more.  Drinks are strong and music is good. That calls for a great night.
I used to love XS but Saturday was ridiculous. We got a table for a bachelorette party and I guess since it's all inclusive (bottle of vodka, champagne, tax and grat for $600) we were totally ignored all night after being placed in Suburbia on the other side of the pool. We were supposed to have a host text us but none ever did so I had no one to call when we were stuck in the table line forever. My friend has a broken foot and was on crutches so I thought it was ridiculous that they walked the most busy and ass backward way when taking us to the table. He was on his phone the whole time and didn't even wait for my friend to keep us. Obviously I didn't tip him. When we got to our table, there was a used condom on the ground next to it and it took an hour and me asking 3 different people to get it cleaned up. Service was crappy and people kept sitting on the arms of our couch. Security was non-existant which is weird because on the inside and the tables outside but still near the inside part, service and security is great. There was a bunch of people on e, including our neighbors to the left, so that got annoying. Then, the club was so over capacity that they wouldn't even let us inside or near the floor until 3AM. They just locked us outside. This place has just been going downhill since Hakkasan opened, the acts, the crowd, everything just seems to be getting worse which is a shame because I used to really like XS (see past review). I'll just stick to other clubs for right now. I mean, even Marquee is better.
