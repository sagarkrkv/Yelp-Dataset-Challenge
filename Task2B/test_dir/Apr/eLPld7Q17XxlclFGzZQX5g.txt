Excellent food.  The variety on their all you can eat menu is wonderful.  The servers were all friendly.   The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they forgot one of my order towards the end.  Still an overall good visit.
Always delicious rolls, Tiger roll is my favorite. Never disappointed with the food. Quick service and always packed with customers for dinner.
One of THE go-to sushi places in town.. . You're not doing it right if you don't do AYCE.. . Seafood salad is amazing, and you can order half rolls so you can try all the different rolls on the menu....if you eat as much as I do =)
This place is GREAT!! My wife and I found it by accident on a trip to Vegas. We stopped at the grovery store in the same strip mall and then saw this sushi joint around lunchtime and decided to give it a shot. We had the AYCE lunch which was an amazing deal. It included specialty rolls, desserts and appetizers. The service was great too. We sat at the bar and the chef was very attentive and we rarely had an empty plate in fron of us. Bottom line, if you're in Vegas and want a better deal then you can find on the strip this is the place to go.
This used to be one of our favorite sushi spots, up until recently. We've ate here quite a few times but the service is their downfall. We went on a Thursday around 4 and received horrible service, considering they were not that busy. It took us about 30minutes to receive our appetizers, fine. But after already having been there 45 minutes the waitress still hadn't come back to take our order! Appalling, since she had walked by our table about 10times and couldn't be bothered to at least take our order! We were getting frustrated, especially since they give your table a time limit. . So we stopped the manager as she walked by and made her aware of the situation. Instead of taking charge and handling the situation (umm.. Hello? Take our order!) she just kept saying sorry sorry and walked away. Incompetent! . We walked out of there. As soon as we hit the parking lot the manager now wanted to handle it and offer discounts or whatever  she could do to make us come back in. Needless to say, we are never coming back here. . It's a shame. The menu is great and I like the fact that they will make custom orders. Also they have a kids menu which is nice, but I was shocked to find out my 8 year old would have to pay adult price for AYCE!!!
This is a nice option off the strip.  The kama teriyaki was quite good.  I tried several specialty rolls and they were better than average, which for an all you can eat is a score.  If you're coming from the strip, make sure you ask the hostess which taxi company to call for your ride back.  I called 2 that left me standing before I asked, and the one they suggested came within minutes.
This is my favorite place near me. The Ayce all you can eat is a must. I go here about once a week the workers are always friendly even other guest. I go sit at the bar a lot and rarely have i been to a place where other people are so open and friendly especially where this place is located.. . Great sushi is not Fresh or too aged but this place is a great balance, Since i eat here a lot i have noticed difference at times. The first thing I order when I sit down is the Seafood Salad, That is eff'in awesome must have it and it is included in the AYCE. I order the Snow in Vegas and the Man whore. those things are my must haves before i order anything else.
I LOVE sushi and this place is a hidden gem in the ghetto. My coworkers and I love to go after a long day at work and stuff our faces until we look like we are 9 months pregnant with twins. Plus, it's all you can eat! . . The sashimi is excellent. Big, fresh pieces of fish, not the small pieces you get at other places. The white tuna and the garlic tuna are my favorite. The white tuna literally melts in your mouth. I could eat only that and be satisfied. It's like butter baby! . . Now the rolls, where I even start they are all amazing, and I've tried almost all of them. My favorite is the Be Mine roll. It's lightly fried with a crab meat/cream cheese mixture in the middle, and it has a sweet taste to it. Very tasty. Some of my other favorites are Happy Ending, Baby One More Time, Sun Of The Beach, and No Name just to name a few. . . The only down fall to this place (but I still wouldn't take a star off for it) is it is alway busy. It doesn't matter what time of day, it's busy. They did just expand the restaurant, but it's still packed. So prepare to have to wait, but I promise it's worth it! . . Don't forget the mochi, mango is my favorite.
This is one of my favorite places in town. The Wet Dream rollis lovely. Service can be a little spotty when it's busy but overall good.
One of my favorite AYCE sushi in the valley.  The service is prompt and the food is delicious!! I'm never disappointed when I go unless they are sold out on what I would like. Depending ob what time you go especially during dinner add apx 30mins of wait time. They are always packed!
Yama Sushi - An AYCE restaurant approximately $25 a person. People give them 4 solid stars on yelp yet the service is fair so is the food. Their rolls are awesome and huge yet contains a large amount of rice which is their trick to make you feel full. However, I think the food worth the money because you can't complain about sushi. I personally give this restaurant 3.5/5 because service isn't what I expected.
Totally worth the cost.  The food was great and the staff was very friendly.  The names of the sushi were definitely ice breakers and kept our group entertained and laughing the whole night.  I.e. "who's your daddy" "son of  the beach" "man whore". I loved the spicy seafood salad, and the "Damn harry"...not to be confused with the Harry Potter.  If you start to get full but still want to try other options, you can ask them to do half rolls.  Time limit for AYCE is 2 hours.  They start timing once everyone is seated.  Dessert is also included :)
