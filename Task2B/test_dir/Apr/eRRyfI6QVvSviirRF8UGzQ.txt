First time to Vegas I stayed at encore July 2010. Fell in love with this hotel. Best place to stay and party.  Food is awesome. . Buffet at Wynn is good. . SW  for dinner. Country club for lunch. Awesome . . 2nd stay at ENCORE dec 2010 . It's cold in dec in Vegas . But still a great time Encore pool is heated . . 3rd stay Came back for the Super Bowl FEB 2011. GB vs PIT. Had a great time stayed at ENCORE and bet on GB to win :)
-room was beautiful and spacious. -bed is comfortable. -bathroom smelled a little construction when wet (stucco-type smell). -upper floors have a great view. -room service breakfast was delicious (kinda expensive). . -casino area is not too chaotic or crowded. -saw Herman Cain gambling (!!!). -pool area is too small and not relaxing.  okay if you want to go down there to party.  not for kids
we just stayed at the encore. We found there service to be insincere. They generally will have good face to face interaction but rarely follow through with anything. Drinks and food are outrageously expensive and the "European pool" is always in and out of the shade. Also, We got a cabana at the pool which never saw the sun. Finally, we left some sun glasses in the women's bathroom. The staff said they had found them  but instead of turning them into the lost and found left them on their cleaning cart and another staff member must of took them because we never got them back. After 6 phone calls their claims staff said too bad.. . We will not be staying at the Encore ever...
I just went to Vegas for the weekend and stayed at the Encore. What a beautiful/amazing hotel. The room was stunning, the customer service was great, and everything else about the hotel was 5 star in my opinion. We did Encore Beach club on Saturday, I had such a blast, but I am so happy we had a bungalow with bottles, that place is not cheap! We then went to the pool on Sunday, no complaints there, the pool was beautiful and the staff was great. I also ate at the lobby bar for dinner a few nights. I would definitely stay here again.
So my 3 friends and I went to the encore beach club Saturday and two of them turned in mine and my other friend stuff into lost and found with out name.... My phone two Steve Madden heels two shorts and two cover ups were turned in.... We went to lost and found and the only thing they retrieved was my phone but lost all our other stuff... Don't know how that could of happened when the two girls working there totally identified out stuff and said a worker is bringing it then all of a sudden they said they gave it to some guy we were hanging out with (which was a lie because they didn't have it) we wrote a claim that night and said they would look through videos but said the "trees" were in the way.... Worst Vegas experience ever thanks to the workers of the Encore Beach club...
There are allot better hotels. Hopefully they read this. They will work on it. No comps. Even If you spend $10000 at craps and tip every hand win or lose. And if yer not super attractive they are very rude. Oh and house keeping stole my meds.and my ray bans.
After a long flight from Glasgow, I landed in Las Vegas for a nice weekend to recover from jet lag before heading back to LA. I stayed at my usual favorite spot, the Encore (in the Encore tower suites) so this review might be a little bias. This place is beautiful, clean & great for a nice weekend get away or a long stay. I love this hotel because it reminds me of Europe, has so many yummy places to eat & awesome craps tables. If you love to relax you can lounge by the 2 amazing pools (one family style and one European 21+ pool) or hit the Spa for a relaxing massage & facial. If you like to party there is the encore beach club (a day pool party) XS, & Surrender ( nightclubs, both so much fun). There are also numerous bars and lounges for pre drink or chilling. I used to stay at the Wynn but the encore is MUCH chiller, less crowds of families and children & more adult friendly. Awesome views from your room & excellent amenities! Such a wonderful hotel, sometimes I wish I could live there :)
After a long week of trade show in Vegas where I was staying at the Mandalay Bay I checked into the Encore for the weekend for some down time.. . The first room they have me had a north facing vista which just looks like a building site complete with the Las Vegas Hilton whichhas seen better days. As a tip all the odd numbered rooms face north. I asked to change to a strip view and unfortunately they didn't have a room. They did however promised to call me back the next day to change my room. In my experience hotel staff normally tell you that to get you off their back and then forget about it. The next day, we got a call saying our strip view room was waiting and we could move whenever we liked. I was taken aback by that, a hotel that actually does what they say they will between shifts!. . If I had to say the one word that makes the Encore worth the extra money then it would be "service". Not once did I bump into a miserable employee or someone who didn't bend over backwards to help.. . My only grumble about this trip is the business center. It opens at 8am Pacific time when it's already 11am on the East Coast and 4pm back in the UK. I had to print and scan something in a hurry but I had to wait until it was open. When it did open, I was assisted by the most helpful person and I managed to get my documents printed and scanned.. . Another delightful stay. My compliments to Steve Wynn and his staff for setting a high bar for hotels in Las Vegas.
Stayed here this past week for my birthday and couldn't have stayed in a nicer place and had a wonderful experience. . . At check in, Katrina, was so sweet and even noted that it was my birthday. She was very kind and even upgraded our view to The Strip/Pool view. Even gave us a warning that we might hear noise from Surrender at night (but we didn't!). She was definitely a great person to check-in with!!. . Our room was a resort king suite overlooking the strip/Wynn/ and pool. Awesome layout: separate sitting area, king size bed, huge bathroom. . . Hotel Bell Staff got our luggage to our room in less than 5 minutes from when we called. Very fast and attentive.. . Loved how it was walking distance to mall, Palazzo/Venetian, and a $15 cab ride to Mandalay.. . So happy that we got to stay here. Booked through Hotel Tonight and was able to save over $400 for our stay of 3 nights. You can save more by using promo code GEDRA to save $25 off first booking through Hotel Tonight.
i'm a 30 old dude and came to town by myself to attend a wedding and decided to live it up a bit. what can i say? this place is ridiculous. such an awesome hotel. i got a room on the 61st floor with an amazing view of the mountains. the room was huge (panoramic king suite) and the service was even better.. . i made all these plans as to what i would do with myself during my trip, but i just ended up staying in encore/wynn basically the whole time. i did the nightclub thing at tryst and XS and did the day party at encore beach club. i also just chilled at the much quieter european pool. all were fun as hell in their own way and i definitely recommend each.. . the only negative is how expensive the place is. EVERYTHING is money there. however, you should know that going in like i did. if money isn't an issue for you, then you absolutely have to stay in encore at some point. you will not be disappointed.. . oh, and for the reviewers complaining about noise, encore hosts some of the hottest clubs in town after all. what the hell did you expect? go stay at the stratosphere if you want peace and quiet. unreal.
"Can I get an Encore/do you want more". - Jay Z. . I found myself wanting more of the Encore because it isa very nice and cozy hotel. We walked into a room with a fabulous view of the strip with its sister hotel the Wynn across the way shining bright like diamonds. . . The room was spacious and clean. I always wanted a room with remote control blinds and finally got it here. The bathroom was perfect for taking care of the three S and for make up for the women folk. A safe in the closet kept my goods mine. . . The room service and concierge was on point. The housekeeping was standard. Nice flat screen tv, but it was annoying how Steve Wynn kept poppin up talking on the promo station that automatically pops up of the tv remotes is as much as looked at. . . The lobby and actual casino piece is not as good. The cocktail waitress are not as friendly as some others and the floor restrooms ate not as clean as some of the other luxury hotels. However, I am comparing them to luxury so that means its still better than most hotels.
This is my new Vegas hotel of choice. Beautiful decor. Excellent room service/ customer service. Nice gym and club! What more can I ask? I love it here and will most definitely be back with and without the kids :)
The main bar would not serve us drinks because my wife did not have her ID on her. Granted she looks great but she does not look under 21. . So we went to the other bar where they did not see a need to ID us nor did they ID us at the tables.
I have so many wonderful things to say about The Encore that I don't know where to start. First of all, I actually stayed at another hotel down the street however, my daughter and her fiance had a parlor suite here at The Encore and we walked over here so we could all go do some sightseeing. I had no idea the hotel would be this amazingly beautiful.. . The Restaurants were beautiful, the club Surrender was amazing, you can hear the good vibes and great atmosphere. The walk to her room was incredible with all the amazing shops.. . Then there's the room itself! She had her own personal massage room, steam shower, living room with a bar. It was the best room I had ever seen. The view was amazing...and get this, a major Hollywood celebrity was staying on the same floor, I won't say his name, he's probably still there with his Hollywood wife!. . Next time I visit Vegas I will be booking my room here. I highly recommend it.
Hands down the best hotel in Vegas!  I visit Las Vegas an average of 6-8 times a year.  I have stayed in every hotel from Venetian/Palazzo, Cosmo, Bellagio, etc.  Encore blows away the competition!  From the initial service at valet and check-in to the room service time, Encore has perfected it!  Also, if your not sure about Wynn or Encore, opt for Encore!  The rooms are larger, have a better floor plan, and designed in a such a way, you'll never want to leave!
Nice hotel with large rooms.. Loved the bathroom and separate living space.. But the bed was too soft for me.. The casino area was kind of small.. For a newer hotel,the slot machines felt old too.. There was always traffic to get to the other side of the strip.. Overall, the hotel was good. . I just prefer the Aria/Cosmo side of the strip.
