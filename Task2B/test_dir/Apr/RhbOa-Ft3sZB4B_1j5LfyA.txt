Delicious breakfast. Owner greeted us at door and talked to every customer. Great way to do business. High quality food, good portions, fantastic prices. We had pancakes, French toast, and omelets and all were fantastic. Will definitely return. All servers were kind and helpful.
Having passed by Mr Mama's on numerous occasions over the years, I was finally able to stop by to try them out. . . We were greeted warmly by Mr Mama himself and were seated quickly. As we perused our menus, our drink orders were take and Mr Mama chatted with us a while. He told us they have been open for two years now and 80% of their business was tourists, which I found pretty surprising seeing as they are in a relatively industrial and local area. . . The place was packed but service was hospitable and quick. Refills were on point and the food came out quickly. My ham and cheese omelet was solid and so was the albacore tuna melt. Very tasty and reasonably priced. Everything we had was fresh as well. Definitely sad that it took me so long to give Mr Mama's a chance.. . With service and food as fabulous as it was, I anticipate returning to Mr Mama's often.
I love it! Great Food, friendly staff, small but perfect!!! I would definitely recommend !!!
Came here for breakfast after arriving on an early flight.  The place was clean and friendly staff was a pleasant way to start off our trip. . . Ordered the full size biscuits and gravy, came with 2 eggs and hubby ordered a pancake....It was enough for us to share.  The gravy was excellent, savory and creamy and is made with sausage and bacon....super yum!  They also grill the biscuits which adds to the different textures.  . . Our waitress was very attentive and the prices are very reasonable.
Extremely unexpected!! Driving by and seeing a breakfast place with rave reviews in a strip mall...almost made us drive away except we were hungry and visiting and wanted to try something new. Pleasantly surprised, 11am and a 20 min wait for breakfast! It was delicious!!! Not overly large and the plastic lawn chairs and tables don't make for much extra seating room but super friendly staff, speedy service, and just an overall great experience for visitors in town!!!
Biscuits and Gravyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
This place is the most popular and highest rated breakfast joint in Las Vegas according to Yelp. That's why we came and I understand their reputation.. . We've been at celebrity chef restaurants in the strip all week, so getting out of the center was welcome. It was the cheapest meal of the weak (duh) but it was closer to the top than you'd think.. . Family run, fast, friendly, the food is competent and prepared right. Nothing fancy but arching the kitchen, they know what they're doing. Great value.
BEST BISCUITS AND GRAVY IN VEGAS...thus far in my food journey!! Scrambled eggs were fluffy and the family owned, friendly vibe is amazing!!
My family and I were on a road trip. We stopped in Vegas for a few days...woke up and was debating where we should get breakfast..being a yelper, I got on yelp and found that Mr.Mama's had great reviews. Let me just say my family and I was not disappointed. The owner himself greeted us upon arrival. He was so very sweet and friendly. Told my kids how his grand kids names are both J's as well.. Seated us quickly within 5 minutes and off we are looking at their menu. Kids had their special White Chocolate Chip Pancakes with bacon and a side of sausage. They loved their food. Ate everything! Husband and I had their biscuit in gravy and their Cali omelet.. OMG!! Both dishes were sooo Yummy!!!! We love this place and most definitely will stop by again whenever we're in Vegas!!
Great breakfast, great service, great prices. The owner greets your table and ensures everyone is well taken care of. Had the greek omelet.  Amazing!
My husband and I came here strictly based on Yelp reviews, and I will state here and now that it did not lead us wrong.  This is one of the best breakfasts we had in Vegas, only rivaling Kailyn's Kitchen for taste, quality and price.  . . We lucked out with only a 5-minute wait, but I have a feeling that this is a rare occasion here.. . I had the breakfast burrito, a massive tortilla stuffed full of egg, peppers, mushrooms, cheese, onions, topped off with a spicy (though not overly so) sauce that was, quite simply, to DIE for.  Coffee was delicious and plentiful - the server kept coming back and refilling, over and over, without being asked or even prompted.. . My husband had the Greek omelet and said that it was easily one of the best he'd ever had.  I didn't try it for myself (which I'm now sorry for), but I could see feta cheese and lots of filling spilling out over the sides, which is always good news when you're hungry and hung over!. . The decor was ... interesting.  Sort of almost like a farmhouse, country style - the chairs are actually in the style of wooden recliners, something you'd see on a back porch somewhere in a rural area.  Service was great - I think the owner was actually in there running things on the morning we went.  Prices are very, very reasonable (especially for a touristy town like Vegas).  . . Don't let the strip mall location fool you.  We've found that a lot of the best places here are in little tiny strip malls like this one.  . . Mr. Mama's is well worth the drive and you'll get better food (and service) than any place on the Strip - I'd lay money on it.. . Highly recommended!
Everything was great!! Food was amazing!! Favorite breakfast place went there 2x on our vacation!! Highly recommend Mr Mamas.
What an excellent find!  Went there for breakfast with 3 others.  All our choices were good but the pancakes were awesome!  Light and flavorful. And they served them with a big pitcher of syrup instead of the usual mini thimble portion most restaurants serve that disappear after the first bite.  Never had to wait for coffee refills.  Our waitress was very attentive and we even got a visit from the owner who visited each table to make sure everything was top notch.  Good job you guys!  We'll be back!  . P & friends
Very good breakfast place. It's only about a 10-15 minute drive from the strip bit it's worth it.. . We went pretty early about 9 in the morning and it was already pretty full and this was on a Wednesday.  So if you go there any later and on a weekend I'm sure you may hit a waiting time.. . We were seated immediately. We ordered Mama's french toast which comes with eggs and your choice of bacon, sausage or ham. I chose the sausage. Anthony ordered the ham steak plate and that comes with toast (he chose the Texas toast), potatoes, and eggs. Everything tasted right and was cooked nicely. I love my breakfast so it definitely hit the spot. Mr. Mama was even there himself and was a nice and dedixated, family centered man. Knowing someone like that ran the place was nice and he himself went around offering coffee to his guests.
We have been in Vegas for a week. Breakfast here at Mr. Mamas was the best. Food was hot and service was quick and very polite.  We ate here twice during our stay and both times the food was superb. Great place!!!
My friends and I were moving from one hotel on the Strip to another, and since we had a car we decided to come here for breakfast. It was a nice break from the Strip and incredibly cheap. It was a simple neighborhood place (although some people looked like they came from the Strip); the service and food were good. I had a 4 egg omelette with 4 fillings for $10 including tax and tip and it came with a choice of toast and hash browns. While I don't really eat gravy, they apparently make it differently here. The manager (?) saw that it was clearly our first time there and gave us a sample. It was delicious!. Definitely go if you have a car and need a break from the Strip!
Pretty delicious!. . Found this place on yelp after thinking the hotel food wouldn't be good enough.  I ordered pancakes since they were the special.  I'm not usually a big pancake eater but these were just perfect!  Sometimes places overload pancakes and I can't possibly eat them all but these were light and fluffy and the ingredients were perfectly balanced.. . My favorite thing about this place was that they got you in and out quickly and there was little to no waiting time.. . Don't expect big Vegas vibe.  This is a normal place probably for the locals.. . The food was inexpensive and the service was ON IT!. . I loved it! I'd go here again :)
Review 100 right here goes to a guy named Mr. Mama!. . While that may not be the man's real name, the food's pretty excellent, so if his last name is Mama, the first name should be Slapyo... as in food so good you'll wanna Slapyo Mama!. . It's in a really tucked-away place, in an industrial area filled with cars and guns, so I didn't know what to expect when I went with Elite Emily, but we were pleasantly surprised. I liked my chili omelette (actually wish there was more chili, because it was great), and the hash browns were crispy good in a little slivered semi-cake of starchy yumminess.. . Highlight of our foodventure was the staff though. The owner was in there, personally seating and chatting with people, and everyone from the cooks to the waitcrew were smiling and pleasant, like they actually genuinely enjoyed their job. You know I'm a sucker for a happy staff, and there's a good bet we'll be back.
This is a little mom and pop place, the food is all made from scratch.  The wait was 45 minutes to get a table, and it was worth it!  Everything was excellent, and even my kids cleaned their plates, which, to my memory, has NEVER happened before.
The Yelp reviews were right on the money for this amazing breakfast/lunch place. The service was outstanding especially considering how insanely busy they were the morning we visited. The poached eggs were perfect, the Greek Omelet was fantastic and my breakfast burrito was the incredibly delicious.  Drinks and breakfast for our family of 3 totaled $25 great deal!
Like others visiting Las Vegas...we wanted a good breakfast, not some touristy place with inflated prices and mediocre food.  I googled "best breakfast in Vegas" and Mr. Mama's kept showing up.  I read enoughreviews to know that we HAD to try this place.  Let me tell you....these reviews did not lie.  I had the Cali omelette, and I must say, it was the best omelette I've ever had.  I ate the whole thing (4 egg omelette with hash browns).  WOW.  The owner greeted everyone who walked in the front door, and as we left, he thanked us for the business.  This guy knows how to run a  a successful operation.  Great staff and great food.  Absolutely recommend!
Food fabulous. . Blue walls, sea themed. . Route 66 pictures. . Cheap prices for great meals. . Wait long, but food for a song. . Everything looks good. . People are regulars here. . Host saw we had computers,. Got us a back table by the plug. . Free wifi for a packed place,. We pinged 14 mbs up and down! . Very friendly staff, . Small place in a strip mall not much parking. . . We will be back next time we're in Vegas.
Fantastic food, amazing service. Very clean. Great place to come for breakfast or lunch if you are staying on the strip. Came two days in a row!
Decided to come here for breakfast because of the great reviews on Yelp.. There was about a 30 minute wait on Monday around 11am so it's pretty crowded.  The owner/host is VERY friendly and made the experience a lot more enjoyable.  The food was good quality, though not anything to rave about.  I've never ever had breakfast food that's amazing.  Maybe it's just not possible to create a masterpiece out of eggs or pancakes! I was searching for waffles on the menu, but apparently they don't offer them... bummer!. I ordered french toast and eggs.  BF got french toast with eggs, hash browns, ham and coffee.  The price for 2 meals and a coffee was under $16. Not bad! (Though I just had 1 piece of french toast and 1 egg)  The place is pretty small which is common for these breakfast/brunch places but they have 2 TV's which is great.  The service was great and the staff was very friendly. Nothing bad to say about this place.
This place is pretty decent. Their breakfast are tasty, the main reason I give them 4 vs 5 stars is their prices are bit high for the portion sizes. Their steak and egg "daily special" was $13, you can find steak and eggs ( I mean good steak and eggs) at a lot of location for a lot less. I had their white chocolate chip pancakes and they were delicious. My one friend always gets the chili omelet and he says it's his favorite. .   The owner is friendly and always comes up and talks to his customers. I would definitely recommend this place and support local business's
Don't miss having breakfast at this place. The food is awesome. There is a wait for a reason.
Yelp reviews drew me in. So here goes mine. Wonderfully surprised by the large portion of food and delicious flavor. Add on top of that, cheap price. Don't be turned off by the location. Yes, it is industrial, but it adds to the uniqueness of this diamond in the rough.. It is very nice when the owner greets you upon entrance. He is the Hostess with the mostess. He is friendly and even gave me the history of his family restaurant business started by grandpa.
This is what my wife and I call a yelp-bomb... Which is that yelp says it's amazing but in reality it is below average.  I love chicken fried steak and get it at almost every chance i can for breakfast.  So no surprise here that is what I ordered.  It looked amazing and seemed like it was going to be delicious but unfortunately it didn't taste nearly as good as it looked.  First the gravy was starchy and lacked flavor.  Then the steak was too thick and tough for my liking and it also lacked flavor.  I kept taking the next bit hoping it would be better but it wasn't.  Needless to say I will never go back to this place again.  My wife got an omelet and it looked pretty good but she was also disappointed.  Their French toast looked good so if you go maybe try that.  If you want a great breakfast head down the street to Egg and I... Much better food!
Was in Vegas for a week for Spring Break and managed to eat here, twice! . . Superb customer service. When the owner takes time to be the hostess,  you know he takes care of his people very well.  . . The food: excellent. The first time we ate there my son ordered a burger for breakfast. He loved it so much. That's the reason why we came back again. . . I had an omelette thefirst time and couldn't finish it all. Big enough to share.  The second time I had the BLT sandwich.  So good, couldn't finish it, but took the left overs to go and had a great snack on the plane back home. . . The staff: Friendly! . . The price: reasonable. . . Will definitely make Mr. Mamas a place to stop and eat at when in VEGAS!
Love this place! We go to vegas a lot and always  am looking for a good breakfast place and have finally found one! Menu is a good size not to many items so not overwhelming and everything is made from scratch and tastes great and the service is excellent! This will be a regular for us every time we visit!
Been here twice now and wasn't disappointed! The food is amazing and the people are too. The biscuits and gravy is amazing. The French toast is amazing. The Greek omelette is also amazing. Will definitely continue to return!
Amazing costumer service, amazing food. There was a 30 min wait when we went there bc it was supper busy but the staff were so nice and caring during the time we waited that we didn't mind waiting at all.. The food was ammmmmmazzzzzing, totally worth the wait!. I highly recommend this place!!!
Overall great first time experience. I'm a southern girl so I've been looking for a comparable southern diner here in the valley for the past 6 months since I've moved here. Mr. Mamas came highly recommended and the yelp reviews certainly backed that up. . . Came during the afternoon around 2pm; not busy at all and was warmly greeted immediately whom I would like to assume is the owner or at least the manager. Each time someone left as well, he made a point to thank them for coming in and wishing them well. Impressive customer service. . . Service is definitely comparable to a southern diner experience. The set up and lay out of the place as well. I would have liked to see actual seating at the counter being that I was eating by myself so I was seated at a table for 4. During busy hours this is a disadvantage for the business when there are single eaters wanting to dine in. The place is very clean and well kept. . . Now food: I ordered the Mamas chicken fried steak and eggs. Pricing is Very reasonable considering the generous hefty serving sizes. Most places offer only two eggs where on this order it is 3eggs made to order along with a large chicken fried steak. I was also very impressed that my meal was not salty at all. Battered and fried southern meals along with the country gravy that goes on top tend to be on the salty side, but Mr Mamas did not disappoint! The flavors and taste were all separated and not blended into a salty hot mess. I could taste the lightly battered fried steak and could tell the country gravy on top had a more robust taste. . . Again I was impressed with the hefty serving size and definitely a comparable dining to home style southern cooking. The good was rather very good... But I'm giving it 4 stars because I was missing the wow factor to get that 5th star. Maybe I'll come back for the lunch side then give it the 5th star. But I would definitely recommend the place and return. But there was no "oh my gosh" feeling for it to get 5 stars. It was just really good, but not an "oh my gosh" moment.
Thanks to yelpers we went to Mr.Mamas for breakfast which turned out it be delicious. We were sick of eating buffets in Las Vegas and wanted something healthier. It's bit far from the strip but worth the drive. Portions were huge for the price! They offered healthy choices such a egg white omelet/brown rice. The pancakes were fluffy and not dense like cake. Food was made as ordered and fresh. Not to mention house made hash browns (which is hard to find) not frozen ones. The service was fast and efficient. A hidden gem!
I was in Vegas with some high school classmates who had never been to the U.S., and they wanted an "American breakfast." Wanting to get away from the strip and who my visitors a piece of Americana, I Yelped a breakfast place and came up with Mr. Mama's..    To begin with that others have said, the servers and managers are all extremely friendly. We were greeted when we entered and wished well on our way out, which made the place inviting and great for us out-of-towners..    As a southerner, I ordered my safe but telling biscuits and gravy. The gravy actually had sausage in it, and the biscuits were good, but it was not the most outstanding version I have had. I know that one of my foreign friends ordered the same thing, and he was happy with the experience, which just shows that the dish does not disappoint even those who lack expectations..     One of my other friends ordered the California omelet, which looked traditional and delicious. The omelet was made with four eggs, sour cream, and a healthy portion of avocado on top making it a very appealing dish. My friend ate most of it, so I assume that it was not bad..    If you decide to go, just know that it serves very traditional but basic American breakfast foods.
WOW!!!!!! This place is the bomb. Great food great service reasonable prices and large portions. There on a Wednesday group of six, place packed always a good sign greeted by Mr Mom (nick) very nice and attentive. Thirty minutes wait which was more like twenty. . Had 2 chicken fried steak, 2 cali-omelet, 1 steak n eggs and a vegy omelet every one every much enjoyed the food. Home-fries excellent. . Went back on Thursday. A bit calmer nick saw us coming by the time we were all in the door he had several tables put together and called us by our names. Now that's what I call customer service. Again we had the chicken fried steak, the cali omelet. Chilli omelet and a burger with provolone cheese which was cooked a perfect medium rare.  The food again was perfectly cooked and fresh. . The wait staff are excellent.  Friendly, attentive we will definitely come back every time we're in vegas..          EXCELLENT JOB GUYS
This place is a gem!! Not far from the strip, don't be surprised if you have to wait 20-30mins  for seating even on a week day but it's completely worth!! The owner is present onsite and takes a keen interest in service. . . Waitresses are super nice and very accommodating to your food choices and will customize options for you even if they are not on the menu. We loved going there and highly recommend it for brunch or breakfast.
This place is a gem We were playing with luck (and yelp) when we chose this place. Mr.Mama's doesn't disappoint! Great food for great prices. Friendly service. A bustling atmosphere that helps you perk up in the morning! The pancakes are KA-RAZZZZYYYYY GOOD!!!!! The Greek dude at the front is a talker!!! But hey I rather have someone who is genuinely a people person greet me at the door than.... Well.... One who's not!! We frequent Vegas and I hope this place stays!! I'm coming back for more!
Awesome!!! So delicious, great portions, and at such great prices! We will come back again and again.
This was my first time trying out the place. It was packed, and the wait was about 25 mins. Well worth it though. The food was good, the portions huge, and our waitress was awesome. One thing that did irk my boyfriend and I was how the host was talking to other employees. The man, whom I would have to assume is some type of management, was getting frustrated and it was easily noticeable. He mentioned to customers how employees weren't listening to him, and spoke to an employee in a rather rude manner. It made us feel uncomfortable. He should be more aware of his surroundings.
Great service and delicious food. Cool atmosphere and friendly people.  The hash browns were delicious. Definitely worth the short drive from the strip to visit.
Best breakfast in Vegas. The owner, Nick, makes you feel welcome and makes sure you leave happy. Well worth the short trip from the Strip.
Small place. Easy to get to. Super friendly staff and host. There will probably be a wait, but it's not as bad as u think.  Home fries were the best I've ever had. Good juices, but not fresh squeezed. Pancakes top notch, but syrup was standard fare (I'm very particular and prefer 100% maple).  Fiancee deconstructed her breakfast burrito (tortilla on the side).  It was fantastic!  Definitely a repeat next time I'm in Vegas.  And definitely worth the trip off strip.
We were just leaving Vegas after a fun filled weekend and found this place on Yelp. I wish we would have found this place the first day we arrived. . . First off, you come in the door and are greeted by I assume is the owner. He gets your name, gives you a menu to look at while waiting and keeps you updated on how much longer the wait would be. Great personable service by him that really just made the visit that much better. . . Then we sat down. I had the Chili Cheese omelet. I veryw seldom have this because I don't want the beans, but wow was I happy I got this omelet. It was by far the best Chili Cheese omelet I have ever had. The gentleman at the door said he has been making that chili for 30 years and you could tell. . . Everything about this visit was a great experience for breakfast. It is off the strip a couple miles, but well worth the drive. This will be our breakfast place from now on every time we go to Vegas. . . If I am lucky maybe I can talk him out of his chili receipt so I can make it at home. Probably not but it is a good thought. :-)p
If you're looking for an amazing breakfast place away from the crowded strip, this is it! The owner and staff are extremely friendly and attentive; you can tell he takes great pride in his restaurant. Our server Melissa was awesome! Definitely recommend the French toast and home fries with onions & peppers. Wish we'd found this place sooner- very reasonably priced!
My experience with Mr.Mama's was good! I love their gravy and I even love that they let you sample the gravy before they give you your food.  The owner is very nice and also the waiters. Everybody work as a team and even though our party of three came in a little close to closing time they was still happy! I will visit again I loved my chicken fried steak ate it all!!!!
This place is great!  We wanted to get a quick bite on the way home and came across Mr. Mama's.  The service was outstanding and the food was even better.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  A must stop if you are in Vegas!  Wish I had a Mr. Mams's in my area.
LOVE IT!!!!!! The place was amazing . The staff were amazing . The food was amazing . I'm from the south and it was nice to have a little comfort food while in Vegas. I had the biscuit and gravy and I was hook . I know I'm visiting Mr Mama's my next visit to Vegas .
Very nice place, very friendly welcome and alert personnel. Go there of you look for a REALLY good american-style breakfast! Veggie omelett with very fresh vegetables, tadty spinach, mushrooms, chopped peppers/tomatoes; Mama's short stack with pancakes, ham&eggs terrific.... recommendation: get in your car& go there!
I always come here while leaving the Vegas compound.  Breakfast lovers' galore! Been here a few times and never let me down. Awesome boss standin at the front makin sure everyone is happy- tough because there is always a wait- it's worth the wait - trust me.
Nombre d'habitues vous le dirons ce breakfast est le meilleur de Vegas.. En cherchant un lieu ou petit dejeuner en dehors du strip on est tombe cet endroit qui paie pas de mine au premier abord et qui se revele tout simplement succulent pour commencer une longue journee.. De l'omelette au Stack House tout est bon et surtout copieux voire gargantuesque et le tout pour moins de 10$ (hors taxe) !!!
After a great mini honeymoon here in Vegas it was time to go home :( we wanted to end our visit with some great breakfast...... . We where greeted with smiles and my husband got a friendly, welcoming pat on the back. Our server was fast and on point. . Two sips into my coffee and our food is out,  I mean wow that was really fast. I got the French Toast with eggs and ham and my husband got bacon and eggs. All was delicious. I'm so glad we stopped by. Yet another reason to come back to Vegas
