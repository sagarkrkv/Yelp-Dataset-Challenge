A mixed experience. Tried the grilled shitakes and grilled garlic, both disappointing. Beef carpaccio was tasty. Hamachi taco cracker things were not bad. Sweet shrimp in limes were ok but should have been better. Bacon-wrapped grilled mochi was very tasty. They were out of uni. Shredded tempura veg were a bit disappointing.
my fav Japanese restaurant right now! they have so many options and daily specials...you might not always know what your ordering but if your adventurous you wont be disappointed. I have regretted ordering anything here so far. definitely try to broiled squid and the honey toast for dessert
Been coming here for years since it first open about 12+ years ago?. The food is awesome excellent here and there's a ton of variety + huge menu. It's my go-to Japanese place for sure.. . A little downside is that there's always a wait for tables (30+ mins). Unless you put in a reservation (4+ people minimum I believe). . I recommend trying something different everytime you go... there's easily 100+ different little dishes menu items spread all over the walls of the restaurant and at the bar.
Ok I have the most picky bf ever and he was totally down with the beef bowl! Yes! Awesome ramen. Good size portions. Cute girl servers. full tummies.
Tip: Order the Yellowtail Tar Tar for sure.. . Pros: Great food, flavor you can savor and recognize. Once your taste buds catch onto a taste they like, you'll be back. Its also fairly easy to get a seat, and I think they're open late.. . Cons: Uncomfortable seating. They also keep your ongoing bill / check in a slot underneath your table that is quite obtrusive. Is is really that hard to slap a number on the side of each table and hang them behind the register? It may be easy to get a seat, but this restaurant is also on the 2nd floor, and you need to take a scary elevator, or the stairs. Handicapped people are treated to a free haunted ride of the elevator!
Came here on a Tues night at 6pm. Warning. If your coming after 6pm, make a reservation! We were a party of 5 and were lucky to get in. They did accommodate us, but told us we had to leave by 7.  This place got so crowded at 6pm!! Full house! Legit Japanese place. My folks had the ramen, and I had a chicken egg bowl plus a few skewers on the side. Traditional Japanese recipes coming from someone who is Japanese.My folks came with me. They ordered the ramen, but preferred Monta Ramen better.( see my review on them) . Service was a bit hectic, but the place was packed so I don't blame them. Foo
Seriously love the food here . The restaurant has a really cool authentic feeling to it. I've never been to japan but I feel like this is what it would be like there lol. . Their salmon sushi is always so fresh and perfectly cut so if you're into sashimi, I would highly recommend it.. . But only reason why I'm not giving them a 5/5 is because of their super shit menus haha they have really small unclear pictures of some of the food and you literally cannot even tell what it is
You will not be disappointed. It's not the best yakitori style joint I've been to but you cannot deny selection and authenticity reigns supreme here.. . A smallish space, in a strip mall, in Las Vegas, next to a massage parlor does not sound like the makings of a positive dining experience. But not every gem is set upon a pedestal.. . The selection is awesome. If you want to test your adventurous side you will be happy. If you're accompanied by a tame eater you can get them some tempura or teriyaki items. This place is great with squid. They have at least half a dozen variations, one of which should appeal to the squid-lover's pallet. They have a cheap blue collar beef tataki... great. Beef toungue skewers... great. A salad with salmon and salmon roe... fantastic! The whole grilled/broiled squid is just right... nothing fancy, just right.. . They have so many selections it would take a thousand more words to do the menu justice. I'll leave it at this; wide selection, fun atmosphere, friendly service, good quality and great price. Give it a shot.
This place has got to be one of my favorite Japanese izakaya places up there right next to kappo Honda in Orange County. I've been here a couple of times when I'm in Vegas and the food here has always been amazing. All their dishes are super unique, fresh, and authentic. I've been to japan and I would have to say that this restaurant comes very close to the type of food you would get there. Just be careful not to order too much because they have a pretty big selection of food! And all look delicious so you're going to want to order everything!
Oh man so I know everyone just loves this place. . . Well I have been here a couple of times and usually go for the beef bowls. . . . So this time around, we decided to get more of their specialty stuff. . . So we got lots of different things the pork and onions skewers, beef tongue skewers, buttered clams, hamachi sashimi, beef carpaccio, miso cod, salmon Kama. . . . The skewers were ok not as good as kyaras but ok. The clams were ok as well but a little too salty to my liking. Hamachi sashimi was good. The beef carpaccio was too oily. Miso cod was such a disappointment it was mushy very salty and just lacked the sweet flavor you usually get at other places. The salmon Kama was also salty and didn't seem cooked right.. . Surprisingly compared to other reviews I actually thought the service was great. They very attentive . . Sorry maybe we went on an off night
This place is awesome. Been here at least 5 times and consistently find something new that is delicious each time. They have a regular menu, but all along the walls are different customer creations that form an unofficial menu.
Man, that DX miso-based ramen... So delish =] it comes with a bunch of veggies, seaweed and half an egg and some beef. The normal portion was pretty filling, and they also offer a half size. . . The dumplings come steaming hot, and if you like fried tofu, I would recommend trying it. . . The honey toast dessert is huge..
Plenty of tables, as the host stares us in the eyes. We wait for 5 minutes. Nothing is happening. Did I forget to mention......THE SMELL. Oh. My. God. Stay away unless you've worked at a garbage plant for an extended period of time. Seriously, the smell is disgusting. And the floor is super dirty. Not going back.
I haven't been here in a year or two.. Reason being is the last time I walked in with a friend and it smelled soooooo bad. It turned me off I almost thought I was pregnant!. . Well here we are and I walked in tonight and it's that same disgusting smell if they didn't wait so long to seat me I probably would have tolerated it and stayed.. . Weak sauce, it was cool back in its hay day!
Overall, I love this place and it is a must go anytime I'm in Vegas. Like any place, I've found that certain dishes will vary depending on the visit. . . There's usually a wait time depending on what time you go, and I've waited anytime from 20 minutes to an hour and a half. I do think it's worth it, since it's hard to find good food similar to what I had when I was in Japan. . . I've had a variety of the dishes here. Here are some that I always get when I go: Salmon sashimi (very fresh), the agedashi tofu, chicken skewers, yaki onigiri. and the ramen. There are many others, but these are the ones on the top of my head.. . While I love the simplicity of their honey toast, I do wish they would put more honey in it. Other then that, it's a really good to end the meal!
Not too bad!Ramen is fine,I like beef Tataki!Nothing special!. By the way,the Tofu is so salt!
Yum!  Everything we tried was delicious.  Yellowtail something or other (it was atop crisp fried wonton squares), ramen, deep fried chow mein, and black cod filet.  I was worried because, at first, I thought we'd have to order 15 things for me to get full (I'm a little piggy and doing "small plates" kind of freaks me out).  Yes, most plates were small but everything was bursting with flavor.  The ramen and the chow mein were HUGE though, so I was definitely full!. . I was teetering between 4 and 5 stars.  My husband says I give too many 5 star reviews...maybe I just thoroughly enjoy food?  Then came the honey toast.  That made Ichiza earn the 5th star in my book!  Delicious, buttery...it would make an amazing breakfast!  My husband saw it and said, "Oh, that's all you," because he isn't a huge dessert person.  I haven't been much of a desserts person lately since I get so much of it at my bakery.  I honestly don't even love honey.  But that thing.....oh my!  We will definitely be back!
I've been going here with friends for several years.  Authentic Japanese cuisine, lots of special dishes, and priced very affordably.  The problem is, quality and service have dropped significantly.  We ate there this past weekend, 8 of us and it was painful to get service, when food arrived it was 4 pieces for 8 people, then we would wait another 10 minutes for the next item to arrive.    I've left here hungry just about each time I've dined because I get tired of waiting.   Only serve Kirin beer as well, unfortunately.  Won't be back.
When in Vegas - grab a cab and get to this place.. Located about a 10 minute cab ride off the main part of the Strip. It is on the 2nd floor of a non descript shopping mall. No extra points for curb appeal at this place.. . First - the place was packed. We ended up waiting a few minutes, but it was full up. . . Second - Big bottles of Asahi are $5.95. You should get a few of these. . . Lastly - the menu crazy! It is on the menu, but it is also plastered to the walls on a ton of little signs. Ramen DX and Fried Pork with Kimchi were amazing.. . Bonus - the place is open until 2am. . N*joy.....
HONEY TOAST. . . I don't need to say anything more about this place. Get the honey toast. Do it. Now. . . Ramen is average, but the tapas are delicious. Go for the jalapeno fried rice, panko quail eggs, bacon fries pork tenderloin, and the pork belly.
