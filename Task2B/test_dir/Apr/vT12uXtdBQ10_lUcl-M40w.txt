I've stayed at seven different hotels on the strip and Bally's was hands-down the worst. And by worst I mean it wasn't even close. . . Here's the deal: If you are going to operate a hotel/casino as the property that time forgot, and do basically nothing to upgrade/modernize, then fine. But at LEAST either loosen up your gaming OR offer a killer, cheap buffet. Bally's really doesn't do ANYTHING. . . Going to Vegas once in your life and staying at Bally's and then writing an amazing review on it is like going to McDonald's once in your life and then writing a review about how it has the best cheeseburgers, ever, when you've never even had another cheeseburger. . . Seriously - read the reviews. People don't enjoy Bally's. They enjoy the proximity to everything ELSE. . . Of all the stuff to complain about (I could go on, even with the comped room), I thought at least the game floor would be fun. But it's terrible. Everything is from 20 years ago, including the band. We'll never stay here again, even on a comp.
The room was pretty nice but there was no hot water in the shower.  The pool area was closed in March but they still charged the full resort fee. We had booked a room with a king bed but they gave us a room with a queen. The location was great though.
The line to check in is really long! Also we booked a kingbed but got one queen bed! There was no hot water in the shower either. The location of this hotel is great though because it's in the middle of the strip so I liked that.
The only reason Im giving this more than one star is because I stayed in the new tower so the room was nice. . However, the casino needs to be updated desperately. The downstairs "mall/food court" was depressing and gross. I only went down there to find the pool. . . The pool was horrible!!!! I didn't even put my towel down, I just got up and left. . . *You can (& should) go to the Paris pool for free since the two hotels are connected. The Paris pool was very nice! Poolside waitresses serving you drinks/food from 11am-5pm. . Some may think this hotel is fine, but it's Vegas. We pay a lot of money for an experience. I won't be making that exchange with Ballys again. There are plenty of awesome hotels in Vegas that are trying harder and succeeding.
This review is based upon everything except for the hotel since I have never stayed at Bally's.  Overall the casino is nice, but no real theming to it.  The one thing I like is the sports bar that overlooks the sports book, kind of like a skybox.  Restaurant and dining options at Bally's are also good, but not great.. . My major gripe is Bally's removing their iconic entrance with the wrap-around neon and the moving walkways to make room for shopping.  This is a real turn off for me, and don't think I'll be returning.
Our suite in the Jubilee tower was great! Big, quiet, spool and a big walk-in shower. Everything was clean and very up to date in a retro styled fashion sense kinda way... We really enjoyed our stay!
We got a decent rate for a one night stay. Booked for a double queen bed and the room was spacious. . . When we arrived late at the counter there was a long line. Service was slow. Only three people were working on a busy night. So it took awhile to checkin, but the front desk chick was friendly. . . Our stay on the side of the 8th floor we had a view: the "Linq" strip mall sign, liquor store, the monorail tracks was close so we see it pass by every 30 minutes, Cromwell hotel, the Flamingo hotel and some lights from "The Strip". . . The comfort level was good because of how spacious our room was. The bath was decent and clean. Our room was non-smoking and didn't stink. The queen bed we slept in was just okay. . . The kinks:. . - Hole on the bed sheet . - Room AC sounded like a bathroom fan. - Electrical outlets are out of place . . We were told that the newer rooms are on the front of the hotel. Before my stay here I always wondered the theme of this hotel. Is Bally's a Tomorrow-land theme? The monorail that stops by and the round arches at the front hotel entrance makes it seem like it just a tiny bit? Anyways, it's now part of my list of collection of Vegas on the strip hotel stays. . . Being one of the oldest hotels on strip may not be your typical "Bally's Total Fitness" but if it fits within a budget for a quick stay, it's recommended.
24th floor with a partially obstructed view of the Bellagio fountains. NICE. . About everything else average at best. The price/location combo is its saving grace. Anytime I spent at the hotel not sleeping I walked over to Paris.. . The check-out line on Sunday was ridiculous (it was for check ins too) so I did express check out . . .  sorry check-in people.
Worst experience ever!!! Rude receptionist! Not even apologetic that we waited for an hour to check in just to tell us in a rude manner that were not getting our reserved rooms. All their personnels were rude rude rude!!
Never stay at Bally's.. *Long check in lines. *rude receptionist . *rude housekeeping. *gross beddings. *outdated furnitures. *poor ventillation. . Bally's is Vegas worst nightmare! Be warned! This place should be shut down!
Bally's has done some serious upgrading. The elevators, casino, check-in area, etc. still certainly show their wear, but the rooms in the Jubilee tower are super nice. They're new and modern. Comfy beds. Roomy bathroom. Good linens, furniture, TV, etc. And the view is fabulous. Our room overlooked the Strip with great views of the Eiffel Tower and Bellagio fountains. It was awesome sitting by the window and watching the fountain show. The check-in process was easy and the staff weresuper friendly. Sure, it's not the best or fanciest casino on the Strip, but the rooms are fab and the location is great.
This place is actually okay. I like how it's on the strip and super close to the Cosmo. . . The rooms are newly renovated. The bathrooms are okay. For the price of the room and what you get you can't really complain.
So sad to see they're destroying Bally's 1970's space age outdoor walkway that leads into the casino. To me that was the coolest part of the hotel! Luckily there are still remnants of discos past inside. The hall of mirrors leading from the shops into the casino is pretty awesome. Floor to ceiling mirrors surround you while riding up or down the escalator, while they also provide you with 2 retro photo op areas of mini waterfalls and plastic flowers. Hold onto your past Bally's! Other than that, the casino is pretty typical and staff are friendly. No complaints here. They've also got a good size food court past the shops if you're looking for a quick and cheap bite to eat between casino hopping.
Decent place to hang out.  I had the experience waiting for a shuttle bus and all the tour buses that use this as a pickup point.  I would not say it is the most modern and fancy Casino in Vegas and it shows.  I would not have a problem staying here if the price was right.
This hotel to me is like a "no frills" type of place.  Rooms are decent sized and clean. Price isn't bad either.
