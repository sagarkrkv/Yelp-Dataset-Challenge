Combo pan roasted (10/10) - comes with a ton of seafood.  i love spicy food, so i ordered a 6 of 10 spicey kick.. . Ricardo (the Filipino chef) is great. Super entertaining and very attentive. Our group enjoyed him very much! Salamat!. . Clams (7/10) - first time having raw clams, and I did not enjoy them.  Too much of an "Ocean" taste for me.. . Oysters (8/10) - really good oysters.  . . linguini with class and white sauce (9/10) - so much flayvah and so much meat! A+
So here's the scoop:. . 1) No matter what time you go (24/7), there will probably ALWAYS be a wait.  (This is an indicator of how AWESOME the food is there). 2) The wait it TOTALLY worth it!  So stay in line!. 3) The Pan Roast is so good, it'll make you slap somebody!. 4) The portion size is enough to eat twice! (But it's so good, you may try to eat it all at once!). 5) It was one of my BEST meals while in Vegas.. 6) Although the pan roast is not advertised as "cajun," if you have them to spice it hot for you, it is some of the most AUTHENTIC cajun food you'll ever have on the west coast!  (and I'm from down south!). 7) The service is great, and the chefs engage in conversation w/you while preparing your food in front of you!. 8) This place is on my MUST visit list every time I'm in town!. . . Bottom line - Don't miss hittin' this place up before you leave!
We had to abort our first attempt at eating at Oyster Bar due to the line and my hungry wife. We tried but the line was not really moving too quick. We figured that 10am on a Monday would be better and it was. The line was shorter, only 2 people ahead of us, and we were seated in about 5-10 minutes. It's pretty crazy that there is a line always, but they only have like 12-14 seats around a bar type area. They mentioned that some renovations were going to be done soon. Hopefully that means expansion with some more seating. . . We decided to start off with some raw oysters. These were probably the biggest and meatiest oysters that we have ever had. I think that it took the guy 20 seconds to open 12 oysters. Impressive! The wife has a lobster allergy, so it's always a little Russian roulette like ordering seafood, especially at a place where they serve lobster. At least they cook everything in front of you so you can keep an eye out on them. The wife decides on the cioppino since it has no lobster. I opted for the etouffee and told the guy to leave out the lobster. No problem, as all the dishes are prepared to order. For spice levels, the wife chose a 6/10, and I went with 9/10. I shy away from 10/10 just in case the chef kicks it up an extra notch. The spice level on mine was just right, plenty of heat but no residual effects the next day if you know what I mean. Portion sizes are generous here and if you can agree on a dish and spice level, you could easily split any of the main bowl dishes. See the pictures for portion size. . . Great meal and worth maybe a 30 minute wait, more than that might me pushing it. I guess that you can get in line before you are hungry and maybe your timing will be perfect for your appetite to peak as you are seated.
Combo pan roast with chicken crab sausage and shrimp level 6 spicy. The spice was right and would definitely eat again but would not wait 3.5 hours in line for it. There were 5 people in front of me. Logistically wise the restaurant sucks. Just open up a place already.
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  WORTH THE WAIT!. . Guys listen to me.. This place is absolutely unrivaled in terms of food quality and fun service.  Oyster bar at the palace station is absolutely amazing and if you're visiting Las Vegas this is a big local hot spot.. . Yes the wait is long.  We waited about an hour and half but seriously this is worth it.  If you can wait in line at the DMV or for the new iphone you can wait at this place and you won't regret it, i promise you. . . Service:  So much fun!!!  I've never had such a great time with the staff and honestly got to the point of tears due to the laughter.  Everyone seated by us joined along in our festivities and jokes and it was truly a memorable dining experience.  . . Our chef Ricardo was hilarious, knowledgeable and just an all around great guy.   He explained to use thatthey only have limited seating due to health codes and the pots they use to create the gumbo and pan roast have been used for ages.  The seasoning and flavor is literally embedded into the pot and expanding the restaurant would mean introducing pots that are new and not already fused with the spices of the years of usage. . . We got the oysters which were freshly shucked right in front of us and tasted very fresh and plump, very nice.  The spice range is from 1-10 and they tell you that anything above a 5 will leave you sweating.  Personally I think I could've done a 6 or 7 but the 5 was perfect.  Just enough kick without compromising the true flavor.  I got the gumbo and it was to die for! So many blends of spices and served in a giant bowl.  You will end up taking it home which i'm not complaining about, you'll get to carry the experience back home. . . Overall: This place is absolutely amazing and i never ever mind waiting in line for it.  This is truly a gem of Las Vegas and if you ever stop by, you definitely need to check this place out.
The lowdown: So, if you can roll with the punches, you aren't too hungry, you're not in a hurry, and you love seafood with a kick, this is a delicious place to eat. I would readily go again with who wanted to, but I'm not comfortable giving it a strong recommendation generally.. . The food at Oyster Bar is *easily* five stars. The service knocks it down two just as surely. Be aware that this is a time commitment: we went for supper on a Tuesday night - we got in line shortly before six, and it was nearly ten when we left.. . I don't mind waiting for good food - and the food is worth the wait! - but after about an hour and a quarter in line, when we sat down the service was terrible. It was twenty minutes after we were seated before anyone spoke to us (only to tell me that we couldn't order anything yet) and well over half an hour before we were served drinks. This wasn't all the server's fault - she seemed expected to do way more than she was capable of. She would disappear for long periods of time, making it very difficult to order if you needed something - and we did. One more staff member to bring drinks to the line, prepare salad and appetizers, and bus dishes could have made a big difference. That said, she didn't manage the situation well - it's great to keep a good disposition, but razzing customers who are unhappy is no good. I felt badly for having recommended the place. . . We ordered a dozen oysters to share and a pan roast each. The oysters are huge and delicious, but we watched her pour the liquor out when she shucked them - what a waste! My only complaint about the food. . . The pan roast, though - *so* good. Easily the best thing I ate in Vegas. All of the soups and sauces are prepared in this neat contraption with six small soup vats, so you can watch the whole process from your spot at the bar. The cooks are friendly and will answer questions and chat with you (but not assist the server). The combo pan roast was outstanding, and you can order it with a kick. There's lots of perfectly cooked seafood, not just a couple of shrimp like there can be some places, and the portions are extremely generous. Despite all the downsides of our experience, I'm thinking back fondly on the food. I wish we'd been able to bring home leftovers!
The level of spiciness seems to depend on the chef. We went in the afternoon one time, ordered spicy level 6 and it was nice and spicy this time! I went with a combo pan roast with pasta this time and I loved it (:
By far my favorite oyster bar in town. Yes, the wait can be long but it's really worth the wait.  Ate there Saturday night and the chef was Ricardo....dude is crazy funny and the combo pan roast was spectacular!  Seem like we had dinner and a show lol! I'm a local here and had recommended this place to my family and friends....all of them are hooked!  Until next time!
I was SO hungry and SO excited to try the infamous Oyster Bar located in Palace Station. The wait was extremely long because this place literally IS a bar. There were only around 16-18 seats. I think we waited 45 minutes to be seated.. . There was only one chef and one waitress. The place only had six steam kettles, so you can pretty much know when you're going to get your order. We ordered a dozen oysters, a dozen clams, and the combo pan roast which has different kinds of seafood in it. The oysters took forever because there was only one chef.... so basically he handles the chucking of oysters and clams, as well as cook your entree. The waitress seems really busy as well because she handles the clean up, drinks, checks, and appetizers coming out of the back kitchen. . . The oysters were plump and juicy which was a plus. They have oysters for $1 from 1 AM to 9 AM as well. The clams I didn't like so much. They tasted old and had that strong ocean taste; I've had better clams elsewhere. The pan roast took forever but when it was finally ready I wasn't that hungry anymore. The sauce has more of a tomato flavor and was bright orange compared to Ritter's Steam Kettle Cooking in Costa Mesa, California. I did like the fact that Oyster Bar has more crab meat in their pan roast. . . I woulddefinitely come back to try the Alaskan Clam Chowder though. I can't help but compare this place to Ritter's, but I like how Ritter's pan roast isn't as tomato flavored, has more lobster pieces, and there is no wait. My BF likes Oyster Bar better though, so it really depends on your taste and experience.
As noted by all of the other reviews,  there WILL BE a wait as this place has only 18 seats and a limited number of cooking kettles, but your tastebuds will be so delighted that the wait will be well worth it! Upon approaching the Oyster Bar inside the Palace Station Casino you could smell the cajun spices and heat in the air.. just follow your nose! Fortunately there were only 3 people in front of us at 4pm on a Wed, so we only waited approx 15-20 mind for seats. Upon sitting down you can see the authentic kettles and masses of incredible seafood being prepared deftly by one chef. Lobster, crab, mussels, clam, brandy, garlic - ever delicious Cajun ingredient being expertly boiled, simmered, seasoned and prepared to perfection. I have only had seafood as flavorful as this on my one trip to New Orleans. Though we didn't have the oysters, they were being shucked right in front of us and they looked SO incredible! Huge and plump and looking so fresh, we will definitely be ordering a dozen to share next time! . I had the combo pan roast level 6 of spiciness and JJ, the chef that prepared our food, cooked and spiced it to perfection.  It definitely had a kick and every piece of seafood was cooked perfectly - lobster, shrimp and crab. My girlfriend had the shrimp and lobster fra diavolo and it was spicy, brothy, and delicious. The pasta seemed very fresh and drank in the smoky, spicy broth amazingly.  The portions were huge and we left with enough food to eat for at least a meal or two later.  If you aren't grumpy hungry and are willing to wait a little while for genuine flavors and quality this is the place to go!
You are going to have to wait, but I believe the food is worth it. I have been coming here for a couple of years when I'm in town for business before it was open 24hrs. I brought my wife and now whenever we are in town it's a must stop.. . Service has it's good days and bad and each chef has different spice level, I've had a level 10 spice from one and a level 5 from another you might want to ask the waitress.. . Items I love to eat here are steamed clams, raw oysters, and Combo Pan Roast.. I've tried the Gumbo which is really good and the raw clams which were ok.. .  It is a bar so no kids have seen may people try and be refused. I have tried other Station properties but none compare.
Yum! My friend and I got into Vegas on a Friday night at about midnight and was looking for a place to eat. We had never been to Oyster Bar, and was on the fence because it had such good reviews...but at Palace Station, really?. . When we got there at about 1:20 AM, there was a line! We were surprised! Luckily it only took us about an hour to get seated and worth the wait. We shared a pan roast (combo - recommended to us), clams and linguine, the clam chowder, half dozen raw oysters, and a root beer. Yes, it was a hearty amount!. . While waiting for the food, I noticed how the cook was preparing everything. Each order was made to order and prepared individually. I think this really adds to the flavor and freshness of the dish. This is especially unique because the types of food they serve is usually slowed cook and takes long periods of time to prepare, but they were able shorten the period and still make it delicious. . . The clam chowder was one of the best I've had a in a while. It was on the thicker side in regards to soup, but plenty of clams and light on the potatoes, which is always a plus. The pan roast was tasty and I will definitely be reordering this dish - seafood in a lobster bisque...can't go wrong! The half dozen oysters was delicious w/cocktail sauce and horseradish. Finally, my clams and linguine was good. I am personally always on the hunt for the best clams and linguine since Santa Barbara, but with no success, while I can't say this was the best I've every had, it sure does come close! I had left-overs and was totally bummed that I forgot it in my hotel room before returning home! ='(. . I can't wait for my next trip to Vegas, because I will definitely be hitting Oyster Bar again!
One of best comfort food ! Pan-Roasted Anything..  We love it so much that the leftover are coming with us. Some how in some way, the next time u eat it, it taste even better.. We saved it, in our mini refrigerator on the cosmopolitan hotel. FROZEN.. even better.. until we got home tonight and had it for dinner .. !!!
this place is delicious! Since they only have seats around the bar, the wait can be horrendous at times.  We waited 45-60 min for 4 seats.  But it's worth the wait. The oysters are really good, as are the other dishes they have.
Wow. I tried this place based on the reviews and it was better than everyone said.this real good
New look but line still suck. I know your business is good n you don't care about how long people have to wait coz your food is good. But please, have the god damn sympathy on people  so people don't have to feel like dummy n wait in line for 2 hours. My suggestion is to get beeper of some sort to give it to people so they can just go their merry way, gamble, n come back to eat when their beeper vibrate. Also what kind of bullshit system is that you have to wait in line to order take out as well?? Sometimes not all your steamers are used and you can make more money by taking take out order. I love your food and I am a regular but I can only do this so much before I stop coming abd also tell my friends not to come anymore. I know you don't care about one person giving you bad review and it won't make a difference to your business but I don't care. I just want a good service and sometimes I don't even get that at the counter because the server don't care about the customer. Good food can only get you so much. I came from a city where I usually have to wait in line but never get treated like this n it is just bullishit. Also I know food has been taking longer than 25 minutes . I know for a fact that seafood don't take that long to cook. Longer food means longer wait n you get less customers.
