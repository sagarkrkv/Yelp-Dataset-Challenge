We chose the Tropicana for it's proximity to the Mandalay Bay and being in very close proximity to the strip without all the hustle and bustle with trying to get in and out of your hotel, we also wanted to check out what it looked like since the remodel. . We got a good price on the room so that was a plus. Unfortunately, upon check in, they didn't have our selected room type available and offered us a smoking room. We nicely declined. They said they could give us a room of our type in the Bungalow Tower. We accepted being that we were tired, and needed to get ready for our evening event. I asked if it was an equivalent to the room I had originally booked and with hesitation, she said yes. . The room was OK, it was right off of the Beach cafe and you need your room key to access the tower which made me feel safe but at the same time felt like it was the "projects" of the Hotel (according to my BF). . Room was a lot smaller than expected but clean. There was an awkward balcony that over looked what seemed to be a loading dock or utility parking lot. But if you looked up you had a view of the Mandalay Bay, which was nice. We didn't utilize any room service this time or even gamble in the Hotel but the whole new look is fresh and nice. . We ate at the Beach Cafe, which is 24 hours, and their food is pretty good. Service wasn't all that great but it was 3 am. . Valet service was awesome and very helpful. All in all we enjoyed our stay. We will book again if we can get the same great rate.
Can't believe how bad of an experience I had. I waited in line to check in for 45 minutes. Then get up to a room with a broken tv. Wait for maintenance for 30 minutes. . . Wake up with enough time to shower and hit the airport, and go to shower and of course that is broken too. Thanks for making me irritated before I fly. . . My one quick night here was horrible. I will tell my company not to waste their money here again. The room was mediocre so nothing special. No wonder they had rooms.
Stayed there last christmas & it's nice...i got a room just below the penthouse suites & it was clean, large and welcoming environment,bathroom thruout, the whole suite.. As James Bond would say "it looks quite comfortable" .....and it is.. Altho it's a shame the pools arent open in the winter & heated, but that being said i had a very pleasant stay there and would definately stay there again.. Yes the casino may not be as large as the others on the strip and no it may not have all the bells & whistles that others do...... But when you walk in & see the carpet you know it's one of the last standing hotels from the heyday of Vegas & i hope it never gets demolished like the rest.
I have been coming to Las Vegas for years, and I have never stayed at the Tropicana. I truly had the time of my life. I was treated like a King from the begining, to the end. What made me decide to write this review, was a lovely lady by the name of Ladonna Alberto. She works at the front desk, and was so warm and welcoming. She was so sweet and helpful, even tho, I was very grumpy from loosing money. I work for SBE in L.A., I live breathe and sleep customer service. Miss Alberto is a true professional, and does an outstanding job, at keeping guest happy. Great job tropicana for having miss Alberto, to represent your conpany, in such a classy manor. It's amazing, how you can loose all your money, but feel good coming back. The staff alone would bring me back to the Tropicana. They no how to make you feel at home. The Tropicana is Number 1, in pampering hotel guest!
Stayed here for a few days with my family over spring break.  They have a great pool area that gets tons of sun and is sheltered away from the buzz of the strip.  The hotel is nice, bright and feels a lot less dungeon-like than some of the other casinos on the strip.  The beds were comfortable, the room was quiet and we had a terrific view of the strip (NYNY, MGM & Excalibur).  It is very convenient to attractions on the strip as well as the monorail which is at the MGM.  Anyone who has stayed in LV knows that the hotel rooms have a tendency to be a bit beat up, coffee makers are no where to be found and pretty much every hotel has a line during check in.  However for the price, $62 per night on priceline +$22 per day resort fee, I think this hotel was an overall great deal.  The free cookies & water bottles were a nice bonus as well.
I recently stayed here for work and I was happy that the hotel has really invested in air fresheners. So when u come in, you don't smell the cigarette smoke but the fresh aroma of  a new hotel.  The pool is great! Looks clean too!
Rooms aren't bad but the rooms bathroom is disgusting. AC didn't work and the maid stole something from my room. . Good music at the pool but overall place was whack.
Note: the three star rating isn't because this is a negative, but it's tough for me to compare this property to my five star rated hotels like the Waldorf in NY, the Hilton Orlando, Bellagio in Vegas, Conrad Hong Kong, etc. So don't interpret my 3 star as being unhappy. . . For the money, this hotel is a good deal. I happen to like this hotel--mainly because it is now part of the Doubletree group, so I get my Hilton Honors points. . . Truth be told, if it were not for being able to earn Hilton Honor points I might stay elsewhere. That being said-- once you understand this hotel is an older property that hashed an extensive renovation, it's easier to overlook the old bones of the basic structure and appreciate it. . . I love the warm Doubletree Chocolate Chip Cookies they give you at check in. . . I really like the two main restaurants-- Biscayne and Bacio. Good value, good food. . . The pool area and grounds are nice.  The casino is fine. The bars are fine. The property does attract an older clientele and slightly more budget conscious. Not likely to find the young trendy hip swinging crowd at Cosmo, Planet Hollywood, MGM or Mandalay Bay but that's okay by me. . . I tend to get around the strip anyway, and actually the Trop is easily accessible to MGM, NY/NY and others. . . So stay for the Hilton points, enjoy the restaurants but spend the rest of your time elsewhere. . . The rooms are ok- nothing impressive, but clean. Towels are crappy. Bathrooms are not as up to date as I prefer. . . One final comment- the hotel staff are really friendly here. I have seen some of the same faces here for many times I've been back. That's a good sign.
I always enjoy my stay at the Tropicana. I just returned home from Las Vegas and even though I didn't stay at the Tropicana we visited every night. They have a blackjack dealer there that goes by the name of Chris with a K (kris). He makes sure we're having a great time every time we go in there. . . Unfortunately most of the time I leave a review on yelp it's not a positive one. I just wanted to make sure that Tropicana knows why we go in there every time we visit Las Vegas! See you again soon Kris!
This past weekend after many trips to Vegas    Me and my family stayed at the Tropicana. For the 1st time. Upon arrival you can see the changes a completely new look on the out side, the new logo is fresh and trendy.  The inside is even better the check in area looks modern and very cool, the casino floor and over all of the entire place looks great The rooms are good looking the pool area is really nice. over all the new tropicana is well thought out in design great job. "On a side note" the only thing we dislike is the check in time we arrive into Vegas around 9:30am from a long 3.5hr drive from Los Angeles. It would be nice if there's a way management can accommodate those who have already reserved rooms to make their trips easy and more pleasant, because not everyone gets into Vegas at the require time for check in witch is set 3pm. It's my believe if there's a way to accommodate people who arrive early they'll keep coming back.
I was gonna wait until I checked out to do a review. But dam the stench of the hallway outside of my room is too much. . I'm here with my wife. Who is here on a training for her employer. . After we checked in I thought "what's the big deal. This looks nice ". Til we got up to our floor. The 5th floor. . There must hv bn some kinda of a flooding or something. Cz they hv had this industrial fan out in the hallway since we checked in on Monday. At first I was tolerable. But dam. This hallway flat out reaks. . There jst no other way to say it. It fucking stinks. . Also we were treated to a tray that sat outside the hallway from the room next to ours for a day and a half. . The hotel as whole isn't too bad. The slot games are ok. The waitresses are old. I'mean is this where Vegas waitresses come to die? Cz fuck they're pretty tired looking. . But very nice. I guess that's good enough. . I'm not much of a gambler. My wife loves keno and can play for hours. I pretty much drink. Oh and eat. . Well eating here is not so good. Cz there isn't much of a selection. It's pretty basic. . A food court. What a joke. A Starbucks. . Oh yea and two over priced restaurants. . I've been going off the strip all week for good food. By the way if you get off the strip. There are some GREAT places to eat. . If this wast a paid stay. I would not stay here. Unless of course u don't care abt this kinda stuff. . The room was not too bad. The tv channels sucked. The bathroom was ok. I slept great. My wife said sure could feel the bed springs thru the mattress. I've read on yelp that stuff cums up missing if they service ur room. So I haven't let them service mine. . We check out Friday soooooo. There ya go.
A lot of older hotels on the strip have had renovations in attempt to keep up with newer chic hotels such as Aria and The Cosmopolitan. Tropicana made an effort, but fell short. . . Service is unreasonably slow, both in receiving service and trying to reach it. A little over forty five minutes for room service to arrive with food. We had ordered appetizers and a rare burger. The food was on the colder end toward lukewarm. Had asked for towels and had them arrive after forty five minutes and a "reminder call". Same sort of service at their Beach Club restaurant. The people are wonderfully nice though. . . I wouldn't return. Not for the service, or the tub that doesn't plug, or the shower head that doesn't stay, or the long walk to the room from any entrance. It's just not worth the money. The room was okay at best.. . Lots of older people as well, not that it was an issue, just a heads up.
Arriving to Tropicana my friends and I were greeted by the doorman- where we checked our bags to wander around Vegas. . . At 3 PM we checked into our room, two beds, a view of the pool and a great view of the Vegas strip, and shortly after our bags were brought up to our rooms and put into our closet for us. Thanks for that because we had five big luggages for our three night getaway. Beds were soft and clean. The bathroom was very nice as well and the soaps (even though I don't use them) smelled very nice! . . Over the course of the stay..... I had to call maintenance once- he came in less than five minutes to fix the chain on our toilet so it would flush. Thank you!. I had to call security once- I was locked out of my room because my room key stopped working. I waited on security for over thirty minutes, soaking wet, in my bikini sitting in the lobby of my floor. No thanks to him. All he did was open my door for me and it took that long. . . The pool....was closed on Friday and Saturday due to "severe" weather. I didn't know wind was severe but I guess if it's over 15 mph then it is? They said the pool was closed because the wind kept knocking the lawn chairs into people. Well then remove the lawn chairs and let people lay on the grass right? Maybe it's just me. I did get to enjoy the pool on Sunday though. Nothing too special so I didn't miss much. . . The casino....free drinks all night as long as you gamble right? No. Most of the servers I had were great. Brought me more than one drink and were very sweet. The last server I had...brought me one drink and got upset when I didn't tip her. Why would I tip when you've only brought me ONE drink? Bring me at least two drinks and be attentive and then I will tip you. And do not ask for a tip. (Her words exactly: oh so y'all don't tip? Oh so you're not going to tip?) seriously don't understand why she thought bringing me one drink meant she deserved a tip. Oh so you can get a tip and never come back around? No. I'll tip someone else. I also thought tips meant you had to earn them not expect them but I come from a different place so I must be misinformed. . . Overall I had a great experience here even with the minor mishaps this is still a good hotel to stay at.
The staff here are friendly and go out of their way to assist their customers.  I had an awesome experience with a female security officer when I was there gambling she assisted my disabled friend and I up to our room and was extremely courteous.
I don't have too much to say about Tropicana. The place was clean and the parking was convenient. And that's about it. . The pool staff was as unhelpful and cocky as can be. The prices in the restaurants and ships in Tropicana are beyond a joke. Should you run out of sun tan lotion at the pool be prepared to pay $17+ for a replacement at the Tropicana. . Asked for a smoke free room.  Apparently they thought I said smoke full because that's what I got. . Even if they fix all that crap you still have to deal with the fact that you are at the end of the strip and have to walk a mile to get to he center of the strip. Pay a little more and stay somewhere closer to the center so you don't have to go so far to get everywhere you want to go.
