Holy crap, that was a meal. The nam kao tod alone is worth five stars. Super crispy rice, but also super tangy. I had the soft shell crab over drunken noodles, it was good but not life-changing. My mother-in-law had the mussel fried omelette, crispy and amazing. My wife had the Thai spaghetti, it was fine. My father-in-law had a beef dish over noodles that was amazingly tender and also tasty. Mango and sticky rice dessert was ok. We ate everything.. . The location is abominable, though rather than wait for a cab, we took the very crappy 20-minute walk back to Las Vegas Blvd. Man, Vegas needs Uber badly. Definitely still worth the visit, and I did derive pleasure from exactly how phenomenally crappy the external surroundings were.
Our friend who is now officially a local said " we are going to the best Thai in the world". Now as you can imagine that is a big statement and something I was weary of, my trepidation certainly wasn't eased once we arrived to the hole in the wall type front door, but then we entered and the place was packed! Our friend ordered her favourite dishes and we were off. The fish was cooked so perfectly it was like a hot knife cutting through butter, then the crispy rice was a playful tease to the taste buds with the sour notes working fantastically with the sausage. My winner winner chicken dinner moment was the duck breast in a red curry sauce. How the hell did they get the skin crispy, flesh like butter and remain that was until the last piece was demolished? I'm guessing some sortie confit was going on here, either way it was my DOD (dish of the day).. Now that I have decided my friend could be correct I. Saying this is the best Thai in the world, the second highlight was the eclectic mix of people throughout the restaurant. From little kids to 60 something millionaires with 20 something plastic brides (good on em). It was definitely an eye opener.. Do yourself a favour and give it a shot!. Food 9.5/10 service 7/10 decor 6/10
I've been coming to this place since it opened.  Been to just about every thai place in town and I always come back to this place.  It's a local secret!!  If your a fan of Thai food, you have to check this place out.  The staff has always givin great service to me but I have been going here since I can remember.
Fantastic Food. Service can be hit or miss depending on your server but I would wait hours to eat the food here. Can't give you one recommendation because everything on the menu is fantastic.  Plan ahead to make your reservations as they book up quickly.  Last time I visited, Anthony Bourdain was filming here and Rocky Patel was dining here with a group from Cigar Aficionado. This place is officially no longer a secret as it was when I first visited shortly after the current owners took over in '99. Bringyour appetite and prepare to be treated to a Thai delight.
I came here on a Friday night at 9:30pm with a party of five!  The menu is immense but we did some research before hand so knew what we would be ordering ahead of time.  We had reservations and were seated right away!. . Tom kah Kai - (3.5 stars)  broth was amazing!  The lime accent was perfect and the coconut was not too overwhelming.  The chicken however did taste old.  If the chicken was more fresh and tender this dish would be a five!  Maybe it was an end of the night issue.. chicken sitting for to long in the back in the pot.. Sea bass drunken noodles - (4.5 stars) the Seanad was super tender and the light breaking was perfect.  The drunken noodles were delicious and the combination was supreme. . Crispy duck in panang curry- (5 stars!) It had a nice crispy exterior and the meat was tender but not at all fatty. The panang curry sauce was a great compliment to the duck. We finished off the sauce by putting it on everything we could find at the table! . Garlic prawns - (4 stars) my first prawn was very good with a very nice garlic sauce.  However my second shrimp was very fishy.  So much so that I could not get the taste out of my mouth.  Everyone else that had one said theirs were great so not sure what happened with that one:-(. Nam prik ong - (3 stars) we were super excited to try this as we saw it featured as one of Ming Tsai'd favorites. While it was tasty, the after taste really reminded us of ground beef. Also it comes with a number of veggies for dipping which wasn't as tasty as the pork rinds that also came with the dish. . Khao soi braised Short rib - (4.5 stars) meat was tender but the real star was the sauce and noodles.  Yummy!. Thai iced tea - (4 stars) very good typical thai ice tea. Fried banana - (3 stars)  ok,not great.  Would not order this again.. Mango and sticky rice - (4 stars) we asked for two orders and they brought them out on one plate.  The mango was delicious but not enough sticky rice. . We were a party of five and they added gratuities on our bill which I found off.. . Service was ok but not great.  Bus boy was  much more attentive then our waitress.. . We will definitively return!  Our bill ended up being around $40 pp including beers and tip!
In a suspiciously run-down strip mall far from the glitz of the strip, Las Vegas natives are enjoying beautiful saki and wonderful Thai food at the bustling hidden gem of Lotus of Siam. . . Our table ordered several dishes to share. The standout was the red curry prepared with soft, delicious, house-made egg noodles (rather than rice). Also lovely was the spicy green papaya salad. . . Although we asked for a 'medium-hot' heat level, the food was very spicy -- leaving a couple of us with watering eyes as we crunched into abundant fresh chilies.. . The prices for food and wine were much more reasonable than most other good (and not so good) meals one could experience in Vegas.
BEST THAI FOOD I'VE HAD!. . I have eaten here twice and the food is so good. This is now a permenant stop every time I come to vegas. . . The menu is huge, I wish I could have tried more. I love that I can pick my heat level. . . - Yellow Beef Curry with Rice - The beef and veggies are nothing special but that curry is so clean and delicious it can make anything taste good. I got heat level 8 which was perfect.. - Drunken Beef Noodles - Very tasty and flavorful noodles. Not greasy. Wife got heat level 5, we both said it needed more heat to make it perfect.. . The plaza it is in, is very empty and sketch looking. But theres plenty of parking.. . Came at 5:45 pm, line was already out the door. They opne at 6! By the time we sat at 6:15 pm, there was a 2 hours wait. Make a reservation if you can or come early!\. . Also, Komol, down the plaza is a great thai alternativeif you are pressed for time and there is a long wait.
Best Thai food in the US? Well, I don't know about that but the menu and food is quite impressive. It probably was the best Thai menu I"ve seen. I had the Thai spaghetti and it was awesome! I wish I could of tried so many other items. The place from the road, looks boarded up and closed. It seems and looks like a Dump! But make no mistake, his place seems to have a huge following and their service is TOP Notch too. I'd go back in a heartbeat.
Favorite thai.
Hands down the best Thai food in Vegas. Nothing even comes close. The Nam Kao Tod (crispy fried rice) is a MUST ORDER. I consistently love the papaya salad. The curries are all fantastic. Even the basics here are amazing. I love to come in for the pad Thai and pad see ewe. . . Be careful though, the spice level is pretty high here. Order the spice level significantly below where you would typically order. They are hot.
The hype is real. I just went here with my parents and we were not disappointed! Wait was long as always, even for a Sunday night at 850pm. However, we got seated at the bar and ordered our drinks first. Thai teas all around of course! Service is pretty darn good here, they sat us down and made sure we got our orders in quickly. Things I would recommend ordering:. . 1) Crispy duck Penang curry (pricey at $24/dish) the skin is so crispy and the duck is cooked to perfection. I personally think the curry is too creamy but for those that love a coconut base curry, this is a must for you! . 2) Garlic prawns - gahhh damn it's good. They peel the skin but keep it semi attached to the meat of the shrimp so that you get the crunch of both. . 3) Veggie tom yum soup - the perfect combo of spicy and sour. . 4) Pad Thai - pretty good, but not their best dish. But I think it's cuz the other dishes I can't get else where as good! . . Wish they would expand and bring this to SoCal! But this place is a must for every Vegas trip. Bill came out to be 85 including tip! Pretty good for the quality of food you get.
I got food poisoning from here but the food was so good I'll still give it 2 stars.  It was tasty enough that I'd even consider going back again despite the painful and unpleasant 36 post-dinner hours.. . The prices are super reasonable.  Even with the cost of a round trip cab ride you'll save money over eating dinner on the strip.  Also, when they say spicy they mean it.  It was perfect for me but some things were too much for my wife.  She can usually hang too.
This place was really good, but I wouldn't get the crispy duck again. The panang sauce was delcioius, but the duck itself was greasy and hard. I was very disappointed and wished we had gotten a different kind of meat. The crispy rice appetizer was great, and so was the khao soi.
I still remember when this restaurant was called "EPoys Restaurant" and this Thai restaurant has much better and healthier food. I'll be coming back next time I'm on this side of town for sure. I recommend this restaurant to anybody that wants Thai food.
OK, reading the other reviews here, i will not be very original! This is a great Thai restaurant and the best I had in Vegas so far! The place is in a remote beaten down section of Las Vegas, not very far from the convention center. I came here with friends at the end of the "National Association of Broadcasters" convention and the place was packed! My friends made a reservation and were there before so I did not have to wait but I saw people waiting in line for up to an hour while we were there.. . The place itself is plain in terms of setting and the service is efficient but basic... but you forget about all this when eating the food and enjoying the company of good friends!
Was sooo excited to come and try. The garlic prawns were yummmmyyyy but the rice was so dry and hard! Sooo dissapointed. Any Asian person know a good asian restaurant needs good rice to go with it. Wished it was perfect :(. . Came back again :) ok so you have to try their northern food - OMG to die for!!
Great Thai food.  Amazing wine list.  Do not let the strip mall scare you.  Food is awesome.
After hearing raves about this place from Food Network shows, I had to stop by during my Vegas visit. . . We ordered the Crispy Duck Panang, Nam Prik Ong and Combination Fried Rice. The portions aren't as huge as you're probably used to from other Thai places, but that was enough to fill two people up. . . The Crispy Duck Panang was the clear highlight of the meal -- tender duck, crisp skin, spicy & creamy panang sauce. On their 1-10 spicy level, we got a 6 and it had a perfect amount of spice to it. Definitely don't discard the basil garnish -- mix it in with the sauce, eat it with your rice. Yum! It comes with a small pot of sticky rice, so you don't really need to order extra rice, but I'm a fan of Thai fried rice, so we got the combination too.. . The Combination Fried Rice was good -- not any better than other Thai fried rices I've had. The chicken wasn't particularly moist or tender, and it only came with 2 shrimps. I would probably stick to just beef fried rice or shrimp fried rice, since the chicken didn't really add anything to the dish.. . The Nam Prik Ong was what I really came here for -- I'd heard Ming Tsai raving about it on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate -- and honestly, I was underwhelmed. Not sure if they were just having an off-batch, but it wasn't as complex or flavorful as I expected it to be. I was expecting it to be spicy, with earthy flavors, herbacious Thai basil & cilantro, maybe some lime for acidity. It had a bit of heat to it, but it was pretty one-note. It reminded me more of a tomato-based chili than anything. . . All in all, I can see why people flock to this place. The menu is really huge and the prices aren't too bad (considering you're in Vegas).. . The strip mall it's located in is honestly really sad and run-down looking, but once you're inside, the ambiance isn't bad.
We went to Lotus of Siam based on a friends recommendation. This was before I even knew that Anthony Bourdain went there in his latest parts unknown episode.  If I would have watch the episode prior to going I totally would have ordered off that northern Thai menu. Instead I'm with my usual of Tom Yum soup and panang.  . . I was dumb enough to order it spice level of eight out of 10. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the food, the level of spice made it almost unbearable. One of my friends ordered it at a level of two and said it was the most enjoyable Thai experience he ever had, partially because I was so miserable.. . The service was great, the location was a bit scary at a random stripmall off the main strip, but don't let that deter you from trying this place out.. . Can't wait to go back.
My wife and I flew down from Toronto for a 3 day getaway to Vegas. The day before we left I caught the Anthony Bourdain review on CNN for Lotus of Siam. We were impressed! Went for lunch at noon and walked by the buffet which was very busy but knew I was ordering off of the Northern Thai menu. We started with Tom Yum soup then ordered 3 dishes from the Northern Thai Pages at the end of their menu. Service was great, food arrived quickly and it was " to die for". We will be back!
Lotus of Siam - Thai restaurant average check ~$17. One of my favorite place in Las Vegas and I believe this is the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. Service is fair to good. Food is the best, they are really consistent so you can come back anytime and the food would be the same, that what get the score. You don't want to come back a month later and the food taste differently, at Lotus of Siam, they give you the "wow" expression when the foods come out. When you see the waiters bring out the food to other people, it just makes you want to order the whole menu because how beautiful and tasty the foods are. I would give this restaurant 5/5 because the foods are amazing and extraordinary
Believe the hype.  This is the best Thai food you're ever going to eat.  You're also going to think you're on your way to a drug deal when you near the restaurant (the area is a bit shady).  It's located in a somewhat questionable strip mall... and doesn't look like much from the outside, but have faith, brothers and sisters.  Lotus of Siam is the kind of foodie heaven we all dream about.  Can I get an amen?  Hallelujah.. . I went with a large group.  Half hour wait.  The place was packed... and for good reason. "How different can it be?", you ask.  "It's Thai food."  First... wash your mouth out with soap and we can have an adult discussion.  Let me know when you're ready.  I can wait.. . Ok... we good?. . I tried a lot (and it was all delicious), but no matter what you get... order this:. . Pad Thai - 5/5. Garlic Prawns - 5/5   . . Go.  Thou shalt be converted.
Came here because of Anthony Bourdain!. . We were thrown off at first by the location and how sketchy it is, but don't feat!! This place is one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to. I'm VERY picky with my Thai food(you can blame my Thai mama) so that's a lot coming from me. I went with my family and ordered musaman curry, yum neau(beef salad), chicken sautee, fish cakes, sticky rice, and a dish that's like Thai salsa, etc. You gotta believe me that we were not disappointed at all. My mom was very happy to see that they added in Northern Thai dishes, because most Thai restaurants don't! I laugh at everyone who goes to this restaurant and orders pad thai, there's so much more deliciousness than pad thai!! Service was super slow and they barely came by to check up on us. We waited for our food for 30 minutes, but it was all worth it. The ambiance is very nice. I will recommend this restaurant to all my friends that will be heading to Las Vegas in the future!. . If you want something similar in San Francisco, go to Osha Thai Restaurant.
Best Thai food we have ever eaten!. The sausage itself, encompasses all the flavors of this magnificent country.
Before heading to Vegas I did a little research and I was a little overwhelmed with all of the big name chefs with restaurants in casinos. I definitely hit a couple of them and they were good but I am always one to seek out the spots off the beaten track. No matter where I did my research the one restaurant that kept coming up was Lotus of Siam. Some reviews have called it the best Thai restaurant in America. I've been to Thailand and I love Thai food so needless to say I was excited. When I called to make reservations I was told that they could only be made one day in advance. So we ended up going somewhere else but made a reservation for the following day. When we got there I was already excited. It's in a run of the mill strip mall and there was already a line out the door. We got there 20 minutes early and still had to wait 25 minutes after our original reservation time. However, this did not bother us because we were told to go to the bar and have a drink. When we finally got seated I was a little overwhelmed with all of the options. That being said as long as you make clear to your server what you like and don't like they will make sure to find something for you.  There were a couple of dishes that I tried that you would be insane not to. My top three favorites were the green papaya salad, the spicy drunken noodles with sea bass and crispy duck with pa nang curry. Every dish was perfectly balanced, very fresh ingredients, spice level was right on and the flavor was undeniably delicious.  I have not eaten at Pok Pok or some of the other famous Thai restaurants around the country but this is officially my favorite. If you're stopping in Vegas I feel like this is truly a must.. . www.612food.com
Maybe it's my fault for having high expectations, but I was disappointed with Lotus of Siam. . . When you get inside the restaurant, they have a bunch of magazine and newspaper clippings plastered on their walls, prestigious awards (James Beard), and countless photos of celebrities and world renowned chefs. You would think that it would just be the best Thai food you will ever eat outside of Thailand (which I haven't had the pleasure of visiting, yet)?. . I have a feeling it's because there aren't much options for Thai cuisine in the neighborhood that they give this place such distinction. I've had better Thai food in Los Angeles (Thai Town) and there is no shortage of Thai restaurants in LA.. . Overall, I am sad that it did not live up to the hype. I'll give this place another visit in the future and see if I have a better things to say next time.
Best Thai food EVER! Great service, beyond delectable food at affordable prices. Service was impeccable, even though the place was packed! I would highly recommend Lotus of Siam when in Vegas.. . We ordered several dishes, and shared amongst ourselves. The curries (red and green) were silky and smooth, the chili dip was amazing as an appetizer, and the dessert - fried bananas, sticky rice with mango, and coconut ice cream - topped off our delicious culinary experience here. Hats off to the hard-working staff here. They are amazing! Thank you all for a wonderful evening!
Offbeat location but excellent food. They have Northern Thai dishes which i haven't seen where i live.  Aside from ordering Larb, went with their recommendations for 4 N Thai dishes and they were all good.  Sticky rice with Mango to wrap up was quite good also.  I would definitely hunt this place down again and get away from the strip next time as well! The place was crowded (and is pretty good size)  the whole time we were there. Service is not exactly what you get used to though coming from somewhere like The Venetian on the strip.
Tried the red chili dip, deep fried catfish (our fav), crispy rice, crispy duck panang (THANK YOU, yelpers!!!!!) , and some sort of street noodles. Still our favorite restaurant!
Excellent thai food in a out of the way strip mall. Its not cheap (it's also not as pricing as the restaurants on the strip) but its worth the money. The laab was killer. The drunken noodles with seabass delicious and the Singa's icy cold. Loved it!
Had to try this out, and didn't regret it, not at all.   Skeezy neighborhood, but plenty of traffic to this restaurant, so it's not an issue.  Got there a bit after 5:30 and hardly had to wait at all; by 6, though, the line was well out the door.  Had a crispy rice appetizer with sour sausage, a creamy and spicy Bangkok soup with chicken, and a Northern Thai red curry with catfish, loaded with vegetables.  All very tasty!Also, they have a great sake selection (tip from the taxi driver).  Was checking it out by my lonesome, yet the staff was friendly and helpful.  As far as I am concerned it lived up to the reputation and I'm very glad I had the experience.
I give this place 3.5 stars. This place is way off the strip and you would probably want a car to get there. Taxi would be expensive I bet. We came here for lunch and arrived around noon and there was a line out the door. Some of the people were there for the lunch buffet and after looking at it, I didnt want to waste a meal on cheap fried stuff. The place is pretty big and we were seated with the sit down side and noticed that more people do that than buffet. Overall, the food is pretty authentic but too bad we werent able to explore more of the authentic dishes.. . Garlic prawns- These bad boys are quite expensive at $22 but they are fried and yummy. I couldnt help but eat the fried shell as well. They werent spicy and did have some flavor to it but I did have a tummy ache after all the fried stuff. I say if you are a fan of seafood, then go ahead and give it a try. Since I am not an avid fan of it, I could have easily passed on it and tried an entree but my yelper self had to try.. . Nam Kao Tod- This is an appetizer that Yelp told me to get. I would not reorder this. It is fried crispy rice pieces that have a sour lemon taste to it. I do not particularly like the flavor and it is not something I would ever crave. I would pass.. . Tofu pad see ew- Average and nothing special about it. I liked the veggies in it though.. . Mango sticky rice+ coconut ice cream- These are sold separately but they put them on the same plate. This dish is always awesome and it tastes like the others I have tried. The sticky rice isnt that sweet which is nice because you have the mangoes and ice cream with it.. . Overall, it is a good Thai place in Vegas and I guess it is similar to Krung Thai in San Jose. Nothing crazy status but a good change than the regular buffet.
