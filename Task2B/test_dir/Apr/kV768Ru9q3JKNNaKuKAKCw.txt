Yeah, unless you're a winning good live poker player, this is basically the only thing you should do when coming to Vegas (other than eating at a fancy restaurant). I'm going to spare you the math lesson on why the games are always favoring the house and focus on the show. No spoilers, but this show is very well choreographed and definitely worth every penny the ticket price.  Go see it, you will see why they call this the best show in Vegas. Also FYI, the three Asian girls are not triplets, they just look alike from afar. #notracistifyoureasian
Great show, starts off a little slow but then really picks up.  The entire water stage is amazing art all it's own
So you would have to be a real jerk to give this show a bad review so I will give it 5 stars. 5 stars because the water is amazing and the functionality of the stage and props not to mention the performers are again amazing. I have seen La Nouba, Love, Mystere, Zumanity, Totem and now O. They all get a 5 star review if you ask me but for the record this was not my favorite. This particular Cirque Du Soleil lacks the humor and the crowd interaction that some of the  other shows have. In the Vegas area I think Zumanity is my favorite and when it comes to the traveling shows I really liked Totem .
I purchased tix to this show while staying at the Bellagio. It was my anniversary and I wanted to do something nice for my wife.. . I figured I might be bored but I would suck it up for her. I didn't think we would both dislike it.. . First of all, it is grossly overpriced. I paid hundreds of dollars for each ticket. Let that sink in for a moment. For 2 tickets I could have made a mortgage payment. That's absurd. I understand the show is expensive to produce, but I expected more for the amount I paid.. . Basically it is a bunch of circus acts that perform around a pool. . . There is no story, few moments of wit or delight, and nothing to actually grab the viewer.. . There are elaborate costumes, but costumes do not a show make.. . My wife and I fell asleep during it. I wasn't trying to be rude. It just happened. I was embarrassed by it when I woke up and realized I'd passed out. But then I looked around and saw I was not the only one in my section. Seems like quite a few of us ponied up for a very expensive nap that night.. . No substance. At all. Go to ABSINTHE. It is much better than CIRQUE. And it has no pretension.
By far my favorite Cirque Show! . . It's changed over the years but always impresses me. . . They now perform over water, I don't remember this being the case years ago, but it's smart. Much safer for the performers.. . Every time I watch O, I'm disappointed in my parents for not putting me in gymnastics when I was younger! I watch in aw and envy. . . The performers are amazing! It's a magical show. Enjoy!
This was my first Cirque du Soleil and it was well worth it! The theater is gorgeous and the stage set-up is exceptional. Water flows through my veins, so it was a no-brainer to see this show first. Everything from buying tickets through to the show was seamless. . There isn't really a rhyme or reason to the story, so it seems bizarre sometimes, but the acrobatics and diving are unbelievable. The costumes are colorful and bright. At times, there is so much going on, you don't know where to look. The stage is so intricate, with the performers disappearing in the pool, never surfacing.. I would definitely see this show again. The Bellagio has done an exceptional job hosting this show.
Part of me has put off writing this review.. . Partly because I paid so much to see Cirque, and partly because it was late and I was tired.. . But truthfully. I did not enjoy O.. . Two of our party loved it. But they are also the two who are the most ADHD of the group. They love bouncing from thing to thing.. . Me? I enjoy a good story. . . O was incredibly hard to follow. It involved at any one point in time at least 8 or so storylines taking place all at the same time, characters thrown together on the same stage. Halfway through I gave up trying to follow and devolved into, "how pretty.". . I had cringed when a friend of mine told me her husband had fallen asleep while during O. But sadly I almost met the same fate, having to pinch myself to stay awake.. . My favorite part was indeed the clowns. I've seen Totem and loved it, most especially for the clowns, and O was no different.. . But all in all I can't recommend O. I'd say if you have the chance to choose a different Cirque show.
This is by far on my list of top 3 favorite Cirque shows. The water is mesmerizing, and all of the performers do amazing jobs! The theater is located in the back area of the beautiful Bellagio Hotel & Casino. I guess not the back-back....the upper corner? It's a little bit of a walk from the front lobby, but pretty easy to find. The price is a little steep for a ticket, but take my word for it - it's worth it! Here's my tip of the day: skip the higher priced orchestra level seats, where your view might be obstructed anyway by a taller person, and get seats in the loggia. No one in front of you, and you get a unique view of the theater. Be sure to take note of the ceiling, it's gorgeous!
We have seen this show 5 times and just about every other Cirque show - we consider it the BEST - Outstanding among outstanding choices....
Fascinating!! Jaw dropping!
This is an awesome show, such talented artists!
So worth the money! This was beautifully executed! It is like abstract performance art. Adding water to cirque meant adding synchronized swimming, diving, and jumping into the water in only ways that cirque performers can do. If you are looking for a unique, yet beautiful show in Vegas, this is definitely for you!
