Started off good. Nachos were good. Drinks were good. The food poisoning my mom and I now have from eating there? Not so good. Will not be coming back.
I guess I don't get the Jimmy Buffet lovers.  But, this review is about the food and not him.  Menu selections were good.  Service was friendly but slow. And the grouper sandwich I had was pretty good.  Problem was that I had to listen to Jimmy Buffet music for the entire meal.  I guess I don't get it.
Loved the nachos and chicken Cobb salad.  5 o'clock somewhere was also sting and yummy
Great atmosphere - you will have fun here. There are all sorts of decorations/props from Jimmy's songs that make a true fan really appreciate the experience. The staff is friendly and fun, and just wants you have a good time.. . There are a ton of drink options to fit anyone's desires. The food is just okay but most people would probably expect that. If you're a Parrothead, you gotta go.
The nachos are the absolute best. HUGE. As big as they are, the staff does a decent job of making sure that there's enough of the "good stuff" so that you aren't left with just a ton of empty sad chips. Make sure to get an extra side of salsa, there's never enough salsa! Everything else that I have ever gotten here is alright, but the nachos are just wonderful. . . The drinks are strong and delicious. Definitely worth the price. . . The atmosphere is great. So much fun to be had. Unless you really really don't like Jimmy Buffett music.. . The wait can be incredibly long for a table though. If you are just looking to grab a drink, they have a counter by the front door.
This place was a reasonable walk from Bally's (so centrally located on the strip). Friendly and fun staff. Cocktails a bit on the pricey side but the food was pretty good and delivered fast for how busy it was. Good place if you're out for a walk and need a good snack.
Live entertainment as we were served beverages it was so much fun one if the best memories we had in Vegas! Jaw dropping!
Margaritas were awesome, but food wasn't very good. I'd give 5 stars for drinks if possible and 2 stars for food. Atmosphere is fun. There was a live band playing when I went. You can't go wrong with a margarita here! As for the food: I ordered the shrimp appetizer which was very buttery and not that great. I also ordered a side salad that only came with lettuce, a few cucumbers, and a couple of tomatoes. My husband got the grilled chicken sandwich with fries. He said he wouldn't order it again.
Well the service started out great. Went to the bar inside the casino. Drinks were great, bartenders lively.... doing little tricks and blowing their whistles. When their star rating dramatically dipped was when we went to the real "bar" where we could order food. Again, service started out great and we ordered some food. 45 minutes passes and our bartender says "let me check on your food" with a wtf where is your food look on his face. He comes back out and says it will be a little bit. In the meantime, people that just sat next to us in both directions got their food within 15 minutes. Needless to say, it took 1.5 hrs to get a burger. Crazy
Ehh....   it's not all that to be honest.. . The food is okay, and the atmosphere is so-so compared to other places you could be on the Strip.   The service is great, but on the Strip, you really shouldn't lackin service at all considering the whole place is a hospitality joint.. . Typical Margaritaville.  Basically you've been to one, you've been to them all and they're not all that.   If you're a fan of Buffett, and have a desire to visit every one of his restaurants, then I would venture in, but otherwise, it's ehh.. . meh.. . yup.
After visiting Vegas so many years I finally had the time to go and check out this place  with my family. Upon are arrival we were greeted with a friendly smile, and where told that we can sit our selfs any where we'd like. Once we sat our selfs we waited 10min!!! for anyone to acknowledge we were their. We got the attention of one of the many servers, We asked for a menu 5 min after asking she brought the menu. After that we never saw her again bad service weak attention to customer service It's very poor no floor manager presence, there's no sense of leadership.
Volcano nachos- amazing. Cheeseburger in paradise- amazing. Fish and chips- amazing. Land shark- amazing. Service- amazing. Staff and entertainment- amazing. Atmosphere- amazing. . . This place was a home run! What an awesome place to eat on the strip, even for locals.
