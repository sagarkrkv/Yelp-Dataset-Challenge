To be sure, an impressive property -- in fact, it's really TOO big.  Suites are really pretty cool and well appointed. Housekeeping was huge disappointment (asked twice to have feather pillows removed...they never were) as, surprisingly, was checkout (I suggested that  the housekeeping staff be notified of their oversight which I had asked twice to have remedied; the agent suggested I just call again next time...making it my fault that something requested twice at a premium priced resort wasn't done).. . I'd stay again, but would make fully sure that things like this were addressed.. . (Note: the hotel did remove my resort fee for the trouble).
I used to love this Place, but it's going down hill from a Service perspective.. . Valet Nightmare!!!
I will never stay here EVER again... For the price the room was ok... Planet Hollywoods suites are much nicer an 1/3 the price. The thing that upset me the most was when housekeeping came some of my make-up went missing. The daily charges are outrageous an when I asked about them the front desk clerk was so rude an I was very nice whenasking... Had a amazing time with people I was with but the hotel itself will never see my business again.
I didn't stay here but am writing from a walk through point of view. As I wasn't able to stay in this fancy hotel, I wanted to walk through it to enjoy the decorations, shops and canals.. . When you visit, make sure to walk along the canals (you can even pay for a gondola ride) and then relax at a cafe in the plaza (St Mark's Square) area surrounded by live entertainment. I saw jugglers, acrobats and musicians during my visit and it is a neat stop to rest while walking down the main road finishing with a scoop of gelato.
Impressive property, but do not play blackjack here!!   They just reduced the payout for a blackjack.  When you get a blackjack at the Venetian or Palazzo, they now only pay 6:5 instead of 3:2.. . So if you bet $20 and get a blackjack, they will only pay you $24 instead of the customary $30.  It's a sucker's game.  They are hoping dumb gamblers won't care about the lower payout.   By lowering the payout for a blackjack, Venetian increases its advantage by 300%!!!  . . Instead, play blackjack at Aria, Bellagio, Wynn or Planet Hollywood.  Almost all their blackjack games are full pay.  . . Don't play 6:5 blackjack, it's for suckers.  Insist on the 3:2 payout.
I really don't think I need to explain further as to why I loveThe Venetian so much. If you truly know me, I lived in Italy for most of my adulthood life, so The Venetian is just the perfect replica of where I grew up and what I'm familiar with. There are evenings when the hotel employees would dress as Venetians in full gowns, masks, and outfits and dress up to play, just like the Carnevale of Venezia that occurs during February-March. This is an on going festival that lasts about a week, so I would think (and hope) that The Venetian follows the tradition as well. From some evenings in April, I understand they participate in the Redentore Festivale, a large fireworks festival at the heart of Piazza di San Marco.. . Just like the real Venezia, you will see a cute replicated Grande Canale that serves gondola rides along with gondoliers crooning classical romantic Italian tunes to you. I'm very fond of this hotel for all its beauty and the perfect replicated ceilings of fine paintings by old masters. I swear I felt like I was in heaven just looking up at the ceilings. Just beyond the bend of the canal is their replicated and most iconic Rialto Bridge. It's cute and painted to its once original colour, and quite crowded, just like the real thing. Even in the outskirts of The Venetian is the infamous replicated Piazza di San Marco!! I just loved everything about it!. . If you do not have time to visit the real Venezia in Italy, The Venetian is a small portion of what the real Venezia has to offer. I loved it even though it was completely replicated x
Eating on the piazza, gondola ride on the Grand Canal, beautiful marble floors lined with shops and of course gaming.
We stayed at the Venetian for my bachelorette party. Staff are always so helpful and friendly and the theme of this hotel is beautiful! I love looking at architectural stuff and this hotel has its own beauty. I think each hotels holds a different theme going on but I sure enjoyed my time at the Venetian. The rooms are clean and I like how they care for the safety of their guests by always requesting their room cards when going up to the elevators. They have a variety of shops connecting to the hotel which I enjoyed alot. I went to Ceasars Palace but I honestly enjoyed the one at the venetian more and at the Palazzos. I have to admit though, it gets super packed especially during weekends. If you want something more calm, I would go for a different hotel but I definitely don't mind coming back here!
Class act! Great rooms, great staff and a great casino. The gym is better equipped than most paid gyms. There's plenty of places to eat as well as shop. Stop in the Bourbon Room for a true experience.
So after walking around Vegas this is the first time I've actually been here. This place is nice. However everything seems so expensive and I'm afraid to touch because I break I buy. They have a gonadal ride inside and outside the hotel. Lots of high end stores.  Not my place parsay but if u got the money why not ?
I wouldn't recommend this hotel even to my worst enemy. Stayed at the Venezia tower the first two nights and was woken up every morning at 5am from a door slamming. Our room was at the end of the hallway and the door that was being slammed I believe was a janitors closet or some kind of employee exit. The slamming wasn't just once but every 5-10 minutes. Come on people it's vegas people don't sleep until 5am. Called the front desk and they moved me rooms into the Venetian tower...... Glad that we were moved but there was a problem in that room as well. Us girls started to get ready for the night and as I was showering the water wasn't going down the drain. Called the front desk again they said they will have someone fix it. I told them we don't have time we need to get ready for the night. The lady then said call back after your done getting ready and we will send someone up. SERIOUSLY gross who wants to take a shower standing in water that isn't going down the drain after someone showers. Seriously lady. She finally said they will move us again for the second time. Moved into the new room and of course something else is wrong with it. The bathroom door doesn't close and the toilet doesn't flush right. For all this money we spent at this hotel I rather would have stayed at the Luxor and gotten a suit. The lady at the front desk was rude as well and didn't want to help out. The only reason I have one star was because I couldn't give a negative one. Never coming here again.
Very nice hotel and casino with helpful dealers. I have stayed here about 25 times and always have done well in the Venetian casino.. . The property is well-maintained and the adjoining Sands Conference center is a great place for a large event.
At the time of reservation we were told the resort fee is included but it was a different story at check in. Last time I was in Vegas was almost 10 years ago and a lot has changed since then. This hotel is really great place to stay for it's price. On an average not fight or big event night it runs around $200 a night for suits. The rooms are really nice with 3 TV's basically in each room. Mini Bar included witch is really pricy and I recommend taking your own drinks and ask for a refrigerator for $25 per night. . . The hotel has a lot of nice restaurants and stores including a gift shop next to the Elevators which is really convenient if you need something really quick. I wasn't to much into gambling since I can't stand the cigaret smell in the casino, even they have crazy air cleaning system running 24/7. . . Bouchon was my favorite Restaurant which is part of Plazo hotel next door in a short walking distance threw the hotel. It is an amazing french restaurant with great service and hospitality, and atmosphere.
This is my favorite hotel is Vegas, i been coming here for over eight years, and i have never had a problem the Venetian couldn't solve, if your looking for a nice upscale, classy hotel and casino ,then this is the place, the grand lux cafe is a great place to have a nice lunch, but room service is always on time, another thing i do enjoy is the casino, i can bring the little kids here and its not like a big party central, i can gamble in peace and know that the family will have a good time while im playing, oh also at night in the casino you can catch a live band playing,awesome
Love this hotel although pay attention to the fridge in your room, move anything in it and you get charged for it.  I almost got charged for 6 sodas that I was moving only to make room for left overs.
If it doesn't have Barney's New York, I will rate it lower. I mean, is it too much to have shopping places everywhere..? I spent hours passing through the resort, tired and boring..
While this place is a little more expensive than others it is terrific.. . The basic room is humongous and elegant. Normally I just stay at an average hotel because we aren't in the room much anyways. We decided to stay here so that I felt comfortable with leaving my gf back in the hotel to relax if she didn't want to come out gambling with me. It was perfect. There was both a tub and living room for us to relax in.. . The hotel is in a perfect location on the strip. I really enjoy it for gambling because it has a high class gambling area but also places like the casino royale are right next door if you want a different more up beat crowd or lower stakes.. . The check-in/out was quick and easy. The hotel has everything you need without even leaving the casino if you don't want to. . . When we went they also gave us tons of coupons that had lots of great deals for activities and restaurants on the strip.. . Overall very impressed with this hotel.
