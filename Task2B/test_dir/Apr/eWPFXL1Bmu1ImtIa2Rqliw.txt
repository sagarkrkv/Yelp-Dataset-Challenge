Ok, I just got back from the MGM Grand Hotel.  Not at all impressed.  Stayed there for 2 nights (which was way toooo long)! The first night I was about to jump in the shower & opened up one of the towels when I noticed a large yellow stain on one of them! Yes, NASTY!!! I had to use my daughter's towel (I forgot mine) It made me wonder what else was stained in the room.  We stayed at the Grand tower which was easy to find & the view from the 18th floor facing the back side of the hotel was just ok. No big deal.  I think I just couldn't get that nasty towel out of my head.  The second night we got some loud rowdy neighbors who were smoking, & not only smoking cigarettes if you know what I mean & this was the non-smoking area (supposedly).  I called the front desk to complain & was placed on hold when all of the sudden I am being transferred to another line.  I only found out I was transferred to security because that's how they answered the phone.  Poor customer service.  Next time please advise me when you are transferring me to someone else to deal with my problem. The problem was temporarily dealt with however 3 hours later (3:00 am) it started again. Needless to say we did not get any sleep & my kids kept coughing all night due to the smoke coming from the room next to us. Never again.
To clarify, we stayed at the MGM Sky loft, not the regular MGM Grand, but I liked the MGM grand quite a bit. Not a big fan of gambling here, I just couldn't catch a break on the craps tables. I did however clean up on the poker tables (not really gambling for me), so I can't complain. If you decide to stay at the MGM, you really should consider the Sky Loft. Crazy excellent service and rooms. Check out my other reviews for more info.
I go to Vegas quite often, been to almost every hotels on the strip. I recently stayed at MGM for the first time because I wanted to go to their lazy-river pool. Hotel staff was very nice when I was checking in, check in was a breeze didn't wait long. I got $50 dining credit for their promo and they also upgraded my room at no charge!!!! I also tried their Buffet and regardless of what other people reviewed I really like their food for the value, prime rib was great, they had many different choices to choose from. I even did the room service to get my breakfast in bed, and the service personal was very nice! and the food was great. Will definitely go back to MGM soon!

Las Vegas;MGM Grand Hotel . Went to Vegas for a conference and stayed at the MGM grand. The room was modern, clean and well designed. The best part of this hotel room is the view of the airport! I get to see airplane coming in and landing at McCarran every 3 minutes. I think this is the best show in Vegas. Despite being so close to the airport, the room is surprisingly quiet. Not a sound or vibration was heard. This room was advertise for 79.99 on hot wire. Remember they charge resort fees per room. . . It was good for the money. If you rate the room only, I would have given MGM grand 5+ stars, given the view of the airport and the technology in room and the decor with the ample sunlight. but then I just remembered I had to put up with a lot of crap on my stay there. You got a feeling that they just don't care about an average costumer like us. So we'll put this hotel on the "could use improvement" category. . . I started the review giving this hotel 5 stars, but kept taking stars off as I write the "Con" section.... . Con: check in line took an hour and fifteen minutes. (not kidding) I was already *not in the mood* after a long day of budget air travel, by the time I got to the front desk I was totally pissed off. They have like 25 check in counters but only 3 of them were staffed. Clearly they don't care about the long line of dying people. There were mangers around but they just stood around and done nothing to help the situation. Check luggage on my way out was impossible given the mid day line and a mid day schedule, I waited 20 minutes and said "fu*k this*. Front desk was well mannered but not helpful. Like they took a class on how to decline all your request without being offensive. Unless you are a whale you are nobody here. Early morning window cleaning (from the outside) could had been intrusive for the people who likes to stay in their hotel room nude. A cable guy showed up in the middle of the day and spent 45 minutes working on my TV set. The guy was polite, but what if I was trying to get lucky?
We have stayed here before and enjoyed so decided to return.  Some good, some bad.  Room was nice enough - we were in the Grand Tower, but few minor problems like the carpet on the other side of the wall from the shower became damp we suspected a leak so called and they came promptly and dried it not sure if they fixed the leak but not wet again.  Had to call because the remote didn't work and the guy had to do something to the back of the TV.  Video checkout didn't work, housekeeping came very late several days.  Staff for the most part friendly and accommodating particularly the Mlife desk.  Brad Garrett comedy club had a great time.  David Copperfield show not that good.  Emerils and Pearl restaurants were very good.  Had fun gambling except for the smoke.  I really wish they would have a no smoking part of the casino. Kind of amazed at the amount of families we saw walking thru the casino.  Husband really enjoyed the pool as well.
The husband and I stayed here for my birthday weekend getaway. We stayed here because of an expedia package we signed up for and this hotel had one of the cheaper rates. This hotel is wide; it felt like a 5 minute walk to go to our west wing room. The room we got was just ok. Kinda bummed that there wasn't much that they had in the room, but I guess that was ok. One gripe was that we didn't like our bathroom; the shower always leaked out to the toilet area, which made puddles on the floor. We had to call housekeeping to get our floorscleaned and replenish our towels cuz we used up the rest of the towels to clean up the mess. Also, they didn't have the best wifi. It would cut on and off, which frustrated us because we were needing it for traveling purposes. . . Over all, our stay was good. If you don't mind being a little far from the busyness on the strip, try this place out. Since a lot of the stuff happens closer to middle part of the strip, we'll check out a different hotel next time we're in Vegas.
Good hotel but just too big for me. It took like 20 minutes to walk to the room from the strip. Just too big for me. It's like a cattle call just getting breakfast.
After my review was up I was contacted by an assistant hotel manager. He reached out to first apologize for my unhappy stay, but too also try and keep me as a happy and returning customer. He guaranteed that my special requests would be granted for the specific room as well as my request to have the pool table in our suite. This is the type of customer service I have come to expect with the MGM Grand and why I will continue to stay with them. I'm no longer looking for another casino to host the bachelor party I'm planning lol
Wifi doesn't work half the time. Skip the overpriced room service ($28+ for yogurt and berries??) and the overpriced watered-down drinks. No bathrobes in the room. . . Worst part was a staffmember trying to enter and then INSISTENTLY banging on the door as I was trying to take a nap to ask if I wanted the room cleaned. The room had already been cleaned AND the Do Not Disturb sign was on the door. . . If the Do Not Disturb sign is up you don't try to come in and you definitely don't bang insistently on the door!!!. . This is the type of crap I would expect at Motel 6, not a supposed 4 or 5 star hotel on the Las Vegas strip. . . Skip this place. There are much better options on the strip for similar pricing.
Rooms were decent, typical Vegas hotel room.  Service was great, hospitality was on point.  we were total taken care of.  Had a great stay, will stay again.
I must say the craftsteak has the best lobster bisque I have ever had, but that is probably the best thing about this place. When you get to the good court they do not have any signs posted or do they tell you that you can not charge to your room. After being in the pool the last thing we had was cash on us, I had to go all the way to the room to get money for the meal. The room wasn't really even cleaned, finger prints all over the mirrors and the table was nasty still and we had a tower suite not a basic room. When you pay for a higher room you should get better service or better quality. The ac didn't work in the living room, some how they claim someone duct taped cardboard to the vent and it blew the motor. Really? That's just ridiculous, I must say I do like the slots. Being a gold mlife member I should be treated like I am not some random person who has never been to the casino/ hotel. I give 3 stars because some of the issues was fixed quickly and the shops are great and craftsteak was AMAZINGGGG!!
It took over an hour to check in. Not so great experience when arriving to stand in that line. The VIP had minimal wait and four additional people who could have assisted with the horribly long standard check in line. . . No refill of shampoo or soap for a four night stay with four people. Needless to say we ran out and had to supply our own.. . We were also provided a room with a view of the airstrip. We were not told of this difference in view when we booked the room and we could not pay their upgrade as nothing was available for the first day. . . Basically, even when you pay their premium rate you are still at the end of the strip, close to the airstrip, have to wait in extended lines and not well treated. Vegas is now run by the corporations and service has taken a back seat to amenities.  Welcome to McDonalds in the Desert.
First time staying at this hotel, and so glad we chose to stay here!  . . Pros: . Many delicious places to eat. Fun atmosphere . A good amount of gaming tables (kuddos  to Art who made playing roulette that much more fun!) . Nice rooms and friendly staff. . Cons: . The only thing I can complain about is the linens and towels. It might just be my sensitive skin but whatever soap they chose to wash with does not feel too clean and is very rough. . . Loved our stay and will be staying again!
I stayed one night at the MGM Grand in the West wing on April 5-6.  I came to Vegas last minute to "crash" my daughters bridesmaids getaway, just for a day of their 3 day jaunt.  Check-in was a breeze.  I was shocked that I got access to my room at 10:45 am!  My room on the 10th floor of the West Wing was really nice.  Modern, clean, comfy bed.  It had plenty of plugs for my I family (pad, phone, Mac).  Staff was nice and my daughter's suite in the tower, with her friends was more than adequate. We had a wonderful time.  I treated them to dinner, we gamble at a very low level, saw a show and spent some time at the pool.  Food was good!  Space is very, very big.  Lots of walking, but enjoyable.   Unfortunately, the next day, checkout was very early, 11:00 am, with no late checkout offered due to the incoming ACM Awards.  All the girls were leaving with flights at various times and we had the whole day to shop for my daughters's shower dress... With a red-eye home.  In leaving my room I quickly grabbed my Mac out of my safe, but did not feel around the bottom, as I usually do, and later discovered that I left my heart shaped white gold diamond necklace in th safe.  I have contacted security and have not lost hope that I may see it again.  The necklace was a recent gift from my husband of 33 years.  I'm hoping someone might see this and turn it in for a reward, which I would pay.  I have been sick over this and nauseated beyond compare.  Security said they are checking into it, and I'm hopeful that they at least call the next guest and inquire if they might have found it.  I sent a picture of the heart close up and one with me wearing the necklace.  What a damper this has put on something that was supposed to be a lifetime fond memory.  Even in my sleep, I dream about it!  I have prayed to St. Anthony, Finder of lost things and hope someone will find it in their heart to return the necklace this Easter season!  God bless.
Myself and a friend both checked in 04/15-04/17 each to their own room. We both commented that the rooms are big, clean and the mattress was so comfortable ( where can I get one for the house). After unpacking, we quickly hit the Lobby Lounge and was treated like Kings by Katherine who served us some of the best cocktails I Have had in a long time.. We both commented this was going to be a great stay in LV for work related business if this is a clue. . WHAT A SHOCK! . It was all down hill after the first night. We decided to go back to the Lobby lounge and was completely ignored by the new servers, who BTW knew we was sitting in the side lounge BECAUSE I asked if it was open. We ordered the same drinks but it was made completely  different. Didn't even have same color, so you knew something was missing. All I knew was the night before it was so freaking good and tonight - like we was at a different bar.  Took 15 min to get 1st drink, and 50 min later I was at the bar asking to cash out for it seemed we had been forgot.. Night before? Our tab was $185 not including tip, we could careless for it was a perfect night. But the second trip, horrible.. I even noticed a table of 4 sit and leave because they couldn't get a server, AND NO-IT WASN'T that busy. . The rest of our stay ranged from poor service at the food courts to the high price end places, just not worthy to waste my time about it here.  . My friend and I commented it's a number's game, we rolled the dice 2nd night and lost -- MGM, lost two clients. ( We both have stayed here before) . Best of luck MGM, get more like Katherine, the lady knows customer service. Have your bartenders use same recipes!
I stayed at the MGM Grand Hotel in their Tower Spa Suite, not cheap I'll say.  The reason I picked this hotel is because I had stayed here in the past with great location to everything, plenty of places to choose from when eating, and easy to get around everywhere.. . However I went there with my honey and it was not the experience I was hoping it would be.  He had been away for a long time and I missed him, I wanted it to be special.. . Check in was easy but my goodness they charge so much for early check in by a few hours.  The room was already empty and clean, all I wanted to do was take a shower before my sweeties flight landed.  I wanted him to see me refreshed and not sweaty and gross.  I accept the charges and they give me my keys for the room.  At first glance it's clean and big, I pull the blinds and to my horror it is not overlooking the strip like I requested.  Turns out the Tower Spa Suites don't overlook the strip at all and there was this big ugly building blocking my view.  The parts of the building that weren't blocking the few, you got to see a nice view of an ugly parking lot of hotel cars and golf carts, along with the roof of a neighboring building.  I closed the blinds back ASAP to hide the mood killing view.. . I showered, got dressed, and laid down for a few moments to take a nap when I heard a terrifying noise coming out of the bathroom.  The shower started leaking water on it's own, almost as if someone was trying to turn it on.  This water going on and off by itself happened the whole weekend stay there.   Not to mention the AC was broken in our bedroom, the heat was so bad my man decided he wanted to sleep on the couch in the living room.  I'm use to heat so I said in the bedroom as the couch wasn't comfortable and wasn't big enough for us both.. . How great to plan a romantic and fun weekend only to end up spending it alone on the first night.  Next day we complained to the front desk and they said they would send someone up around 2pm.  I didn't fuss about the time because we were going to be gone until the sun went down.. . When we returned to our room it was much cooler inside, the AC was finally working!  But come night time again and the AC starts howling and making unusual demonic possessed noises.  The noise is so loud in the bedroom our options are to turn off the AC and be hot or turn the AC and sleep in the living room with the bedroom door closed to try and muffle the sound out.  We picked option #2 which again killed the romance of it all.. . I think when you spend thousands on a hotel room your view should be better then a dirty parking lot and roof, and you should have working showers and AC systems.. . The only upside was the rooms were clean as always.  I've never been unhappy with the cleanliness of a room while staying there.  And the noise level was zero, from any outside rooms.  Not sure if it was due to us being the last room down the hallway, quiet neighbors, or if it was just the noise of the AC was so nice and loud you couldn't really focus on anything else.. . They offered me two free nights if I pay for the first two nights.  I'm honestly not sure if I'll go back and give it a try or if I'll opt to try a different hotel next time.  We shall see.
One of the smokiest casinos in Vegas in my opinion.  The room we had was good enough clean and comfortable.  Upon check in I asked if there was a fridge in my room because I had to store insulin and I was told no.  They did however give me a fridge for free to use.  Be sure to charge everything to your room and sign up for the m life card so you can possibly get some comps or discounts during your stay.  Check out was easily handled on our tv so it was fast and efficient.
My friends and I stayed at MGM April 9-13. The hotel is nice and big with lots of shops and restaurants that were delicious but kinda pricy.  The pools were awesome, the casino was big and the dealers were very nice!  Nicer than any other casinos we went to. The two rooms we got were spacious with comfortable beds and big restrooms. We stayed in the North tower which didn't have a view of the strip. We went the week of the fight so MGM was packed but it's understandable. The valet parking was nice didn't have to wait for that long even though they were so busy! I would definitely come back =)
Over the weekend, I had a chance to stay here, and let me say I only picked this hotel because I wanted to go to Hakkasan (which was bad itself, but that's another review). . . Check in. The guy was not interested in being friendly or helpful. He mumbled everything and did not even ask us how our day was or thank us afterwards. . . West king room. Horrible and tiny. We got two rooms right by the elevators. With paper thin doors we could hear everything. There was no door to the bathroom, and the room door opens right into the bathroom area. No privacy what so ever. . . Speaking of privacy, about an hour after getting to our room, housekeeping opens the door and barges in THAN knocks and says housekeeping. Wtf?! Who does that?! What if I had been naked or something?! . . She does the second room as well. Speaking of the second room, there was a stain on the bed sheets, which was called in immediately. And they did change she sheets but didn't offer to wave any fees or comp nothing for our troubles. . . There was just no courtesy in any part of our stay here. Luckily we were only there for one night, otherwise I might have just left mid stay.. . Oh, one star due the double shower heads, I loved that. But after showering, I open the door to step out into a large puddle, thinking it happened when I opened the door, I asked the bf, and he said no, it was like that during your shower with the door closed. . . Will not be returning.
Every time I go to Vegas, I try to sleep in a different hotel. This time around, was the MGM. I arrived in Vegas with my boyfriend around 9am on a Saturday morning. With check-in not being until 3pm, I was crossing my fingers that our room was ready and we could check in early because I was in need of a nap. The check in line was pretty long, but moved fast. My boyfriend and I stayed in the Executive King suite on the 9th floor, for two nights:. . Pros: . -Check in line went pretty quick, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. -Was able to check in early without a problem. -Room was very clean . -No noise from other rooms. -Quick, express check out on kiosks in the lobby. . Cons:. - I was asked if I wanted a smoking room upon checking in, and I said yes, and the desk clerk did not assign me one like promised. -The maid threw away food I had left on the desk, which looked clearly edible and untouched. -Walking to the pool was a journey. -They held $200 on my debit card because I did not have a credit card for the duration of my stay. -Buffet was mediocre . . . Overall, the trip was successful. Don't forget to check out Wet Republic!
- Wrong directions to our hotel room from the guy at the front desk. - No room service (No fresh towals etc.). - Wifi didnt work very well. - TV lost signal often. btw do not lift up any bottles from the minibar. They will charge you each bottle due to sensors in the fridge. . . I complained at the checkout and they took care about the Hotel fees + Tax (56 Dollars something for two days)
Don't waste your time and money. The odds will always be against you. There is one serving attendant for the entire casino I think!
I stayed here for a conference in a West King "suite."  The line was so long to check in they had seats for people that just couldn't stand any longer.  After waiting for 30 minuets to check in you have to walk down these long corridors to get to your room.  The hotel is HUGE.  For some reason the elevators on the West End are tore up on the inside.  Not sure whats going on in there.  The room itself was small and needed updating, but otherwise clean.  The TV lost signal all the time, and the walls are thin. For some reason the maids will just open up your door and do a room check. Bottom line the MGM Grand is old and needs a refresh (at least the West End dose). I would recommend staying at another MGM properly like the Vdara or ARIA.
We flew in on Sunday morning, checked in at 3pm, check in was long and exhausting, had to take a star off. Everything else including check in associate, room and hotel itself was good as alway, we will return.
Bigger isn't always better, but sometimes it's exactly what you need. If so, the MGM Grand Hotel is especially good for a big group, conference, or event. It's the largest hotel resort in America (World #2) with rooms branded as MGM Grand, Signature, Skylofts, and The Mansion.. . What you'll find at MGM Grand includes:.  * Largest hotel in Vegas with 6,582 rooms.  * Largest casino in Las Vegas.  * 380,000 sq ft convention center.  * 16,800 seat MGM Grand Garden Arena.  * 4 pools including ultra cool Wet Republic.  * A quarter-mile lazy river around the MGM Grand Pools.  * EDM playground Hakkasan Nightclub.  * KA by Cirque Du Soleil theatrical show.  * Brad Garrett's Comedy Club (Headliners vary).  * Regular performers like David Copperfield.  * A dated activity called the CSI: Experience.  * Access to the Las Vegas Monorail ($5/ride; $12/day).  * The Forever Grand Wedding Chapel.  * A Salon and a Spa.  * 11 Specialty Restaurants; 6 Casual Spots, a Buffet, and a Food Court.  * Popular: Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak, Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, & Shibuya.  * Shopping options including Sugar Factory and small boutiques.  * A large (of course) Race and Sports Book.  * The largest bronze statue in the U.S. - Leo the Lion near the LV Strip Entrance. . What you won't find includes:.  * The Lion Habitat that closed in 2012.  * The Wizard of Oz theme from the 1990s.  * Anything truly outstanding or unique, but plenty that's a-ok.  * An escape from long walks between areas of the hotel. . The MGM Grand Hotel is big. In fact, it's the biggest and most spread-out hotel you'll find anywhere. Rooms range between 3-4 stars. The accommodations are better than they were 5 years ago, but still kind of average hotel rooms... which is no surprise when you think of the volume of rooms and people they must accommodate.. . Three stars means a-ok and the MGM is exactly that ... a boring, but very BIG A-OK.
Upon check in they ask for $300 for  incedentials and another $84 for a "resort fee." This is on top of what I paid three months before for the rooms. . . Our West Wing room was clean but very noisy. All three mornings we were woke up by the hotel staff moving dumpsters outside. No hot water one morning either. I called the front desk on two occasions to see about moving rooms but was denied. We won't stay here again. . . For the casino, we had good luck one day on the slots but it took a very long time for a cocktail waitress offer us drinks. We were even playing $10 a spin in the high limit room. We ended up buying most our drinks due to horrible cocktail service for $8-$10 each on top of what we lost. . . All in all, we won't be back to MGM Grand. Their staff was uninterested in making the guest stay enjoyable and MGM seems to be laughing all the way to the bank.
MGM was a pretty awful place to stay this past weekend in Vegas, 4/24 - 4/27. I've stayed in Cosmo and Encore previously and both blow MGM out of the water. I seriously should've saved my money and stayed at the airport Travelodge. . . The casino smells like a weird combo of smoke (standard) and The Victoria's Secret Vanilla Lace scent that all 7th graders used in 2002 (kinda weird/gave me painful pubescent flashbacks). . . Our room on the first floor of the West Wing was like a dungeon. Tiny, gray, and dingy with low ceilings. The one window in the room looked out into a barren area between buildings, with a single cactus growing. The view was so bad that it actually became a joke on our trip. The lighting was dim and cheap-- it was impossible for 2 girls to get ready comfortably. The bathroom area has no door so have fun getting extra comfortable with your roommate's bodily functions. There are doors to the toilet and shower area, but they don't go from floor to ceiling and they slam shut every time. . . No robes.. No iPod dock. . Crappy toiletries that you won't want to take home . Tiny and fuzzy TV screen in the bathroom mirror-- try again MGM. Heard absolutely everything in the halls like there wasn't a wall . Water only got warm sometimes . Did I mention the view of a single cactus? . . There was absolutely nothing luxurious about this hotel, and my friend and I paid more for it than any other hotel we've stayed at in Vegas. There are Best Westerns in Minnesota with more modern fixtures. . . The only good thing about our room was that the bed was super comfortable. Also, Hakkasan and Craftsteak are great. Never again MGM. Bye.
I stopped by the Beauty Shop inside the MGM Grand during my stay. At first I didn't have anything in mind to purchase, more or less just browsing. I was greeted by a lovely lady(whom I forgot the name, whoops) that introduced the Forever Flawless line to me. Facial care with diamonds in it?? Sounded too good to be true. She then sampled a couple creams onto my face.. the results were amazing! At this point, I wanted to try everything! Although they probably would've let me, i didn't want to be that annoying person. She was very patient and kind with me while I explained to her my problem areas and concerns. I ended up purchasing their basic products along with the "Black line". My skin has never looked so good! (being that i am 48) I have recommended a couple of my friends to stop in that will be at the MGM this weekend. I will definitely be revisiting on my next stay at the MGM. What an extravagant experience!
In a nutshell, this place is pretty good as far as giant resort casinos go.  It is a long walk from parking to registration to room, but once we got checked in and settled, it was better.  The hotel (resort) has everything you need so in theory you could stay there the whole trip and feel like you had a great vacation.  It's in a good location and a quick walk to NYNY or even Excalibur to get on the tram to Mandalay.  It is within walking distance to several shops and quick bite (ie fast food) restaurants, which is nice when you're not trying to be too fancy.  . We mostly played poker, and it was a good time.  The staff and dealers were all very nice and both my husband and I did well, which makes it hard to critize, but I will anyway.  My biggest beef is that the "poker room" is not a room.  It's a roped off spot on the side of the casino.  I wish it felt like poker players were more valued, but it is what it is.  . Other than that, we had a great stay.  The cafe made a mean club sandwich, I mean it was loaded with bacon and the bread was toasted just right.  Perfect.
