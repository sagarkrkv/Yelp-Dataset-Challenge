"Everyone loves the Bellagio Fountains," my friend said.  . . "Pshhhh," I thought, "What could be so great about stupid fountains?". . They are a modern marvel.  I was hypnotized.  I couldn't walk by them without stopping. The fountains danced to Celine, to Simple Gifts (the Shakers would approve, I'm sure), and to I'm Proud to Be an American.  I used to hate the latter song, but now I love it.  Because of the fountains.  . . Those fountains are great.
Definitely do not miss this on a trip to Vegas!! This is one of the most amazing things we were lucky enough to get to see on our short trip! And its free!!
I've been to Vegas 1000 tines and never watched the fountains. Wow!! So nice and great fir the whole family!!
Absolutely stunning! If you're in the area of the Bellshill definitely check out the show.It runs every 30 minutes but after 8pm every 15 minutes. The show is about 10 or so minutes but at the same time there's a very romantic song playing in the backgroun. Make sure you stay til the end for the big finish. Take pictures or record it. It's worth it. . Sunny
A must-see.  One thing to know is that the fountains operate on a schedule, so if they're not going when you happen to pass by, stick around or check back.    The technology behind the fountain show is impressive, even if the fountains themselves don't wow you.. . It's beautiful at night especially, with the fountains lit from below.  Everyone can enjoy this and it's so frequent that while it always draws a crowd, you're still sure to get a good view without too much hassle.
Nothing really drives home that modern Vegas feeling like these fountains. It's not just Vegas, but worldwide you simply won't find many fountains like these. And there's really no point in reviewing them because it's not like you can go anywhere on the Strip and not see or hear them. It's a free, 5-star show and if you rated it anything below 5 stars you are a sad sack and that is final.. . It's gotten to the point now where we stop here to see the fountain, but more so to enjoy watching people take awful, crappy photos. It is astonishing how many people will not take the time to properly set a camera to where you don't have the flash come on and ruin everything in the shot. People, you're in Vegas. Take the TIME. No one is kicking you out of your precious spot at the railing. Set up, tweak your settings, and get that photo doneright. And take the time to actually enjoy a show after you post it to your FB or Twitter or whatever so all your friends can look at it and go, "Yeah, been there, done that.". . Remember, you're in Vegas. You aren't planting a flag. You aren't blazing a trail. No one cares. Get off your social accounts and LIVE.
I can watch it all day. "Time to say goodbye" By Andrea Boccelli and Sarah Brightman is the best.
These fountains are just pretty and breathtaking at night! This is a definitely a MUST SEE attraction when coming to Las Vegas! :) But if you are planning to see the Bellagio Fountains at night be sure to grab a good spot because between shows people stop and watch when the show starts and then they leave and some people want to be right in front so be sure to grab a good spot ahead of time and some times it can just be frustrating...
Free? Yes. And actually very cool. . . You saw them in Ocean's 11. . . See them after dinner in the cool of the evening. Too hot during the day. Take a stroll down The Strip and wait till they erupt.
It's funny as to how things work growing up in Springfield Ma, home of the Basketball Hall of Fame I can honestly say that I've never been. Now a Las Vegas resident for over 3 years I've taken the city for granted. The focus has always been for many... Gambling, nightclubs, restaurants, shows, pool parties etc. all that is great but this is just an example of 1 of many other things Vegas has to offer that will satisfy anyone's taste buds. The Bellagio fountains are a world known staple and a must see for anyone who happens to be indulging in Las Vegas festivities.
The fountains of Bellagio literally brought me to tears it was so beautiful and my favorite thing I did in Vegas, and it is free. What more could you want? Shows air every 15 minutes and they switch it up between a few songs. I could stay here all day and just watch. Getting a good spot up front can be difficult so I recommend getting there a full 15 minutes before the show starts. I can't wait to go back to Vegas and watch again! A must see!

Dear tourists:. Do give yourselves a nice treat! Go see this free show, BE AWED, MESMERIZED, ENTERTAINED by this spectacular "Ballet of the Water Show". It's also FREE and great for all ages!. . Even LOCALS keep on going back to enjoy this spectacular show! The beauty of the choreography/music is awsome and is well beyond my ability to decribe - it is to be EXPERIENCED in PERSON!. - If you are still not convinced, just read the better-written reviews by other Yelpers and see their beautiful pics! I wrote this redundant review, because I don't want you to miss this show, as well as other free goodies Bellagio has to offer! Most importantly, as a PROUD Vegas Resident, I just could NOT HELP MYSELF BRAGGING about this show.. . BTW: The shows are on every 15min from 7pm-midnight; every 30min before 7pm! . . ADDITIONAL INFO YOU CAN SKIP. . My wife and I love the show. We always bring our out-of-town guests here - to be entertained and AMAZED! You can park at the Bellagio lot, then find a spot in front of Bellagio or along the Las Vegas Blvd around the fountain.. . Indeed, it will be crowded with excited, happy people! Their oohs and aahs throughout the show are definitely contagious! During and even after the show, you'll see couples hugging and kissing; babies and toddlers on their parents' shoulders clapping their hands and undulating their cute little bodies along with the music and dancing water columns, screaming with laughters - such are the common side effects from the show! You'll love it and will want to stay for the next show, or the next...perhaps at a better vantage viewing point!. . By the way, the patio of the Jasmine Restaurant by the water is a popular spot for a closer view over your favorite food and drinks! Every Sunday, Jasmine also offers a popular Sunday Brunch! Try to get a nice table on its charming patio. You can also try to get a spot in the patios at one of the Paris Hotel restaurants across the street for "remote" viewing.. . Inside Bellagio, be sure to visit its famed, gorgeous "Conservatory and Botanical Garden" with a Theme for every major Holiday Season! Also, around the garden are (1) A small gift shop/showroom with displays of some of the smaller pieces of artwork by the world-renowned Dale Chihuly (- His master piece is also "fixed". on the ceiling of Hotel's grand reception atrium, of course); (2) Cafe Bellagio; (3) Michael Mina Restaurant for Fine Dining ... . - Yes, it's wonderful to visit the Garden and the Fountain Show together, among others!. - One can, of course, park at other casino lots and take a leisure walk on the strip to see other free, themed shows, do some people watching, and enjoy the fountain shows BEFORE and AFTER the walk. . .

Prepare for a show every 15 minutes.
For as many times that I've been by the fountains, it's still a sight to see! . . It's one of the free things left in Vegas to do.  Directly in front of the Bellagio hotel and casino, it's really hard to miss.  You can even dine across the street at Mon Ami Gabi  and enjoy the show.  . . It amazes me how well the fountains are coordinated with many different songs.  They also switch up and go from Michael Jackson to opera to a broadway show song.  You'll be amazed by how high they shoot up! If it's really windy, they will cancel it but it does run every half hour during the day.  . . So if you're visiting this entertaining city, it's definitely worth seeing! For people visiting me, it's always on our list!
Really cool. Great place to take the family to when walking on the strip!
This is impressive.  Nicely choreographed dancing water.  Show every 45 minutes or so, please check before you come to see.  It gets crowded but you want a spot directly in front of the Bellagio or from the opposite side as you get a better view of the whole length of the water show.  Side spots will diminish your field of vision.  Great value, you can't beat free.  Kids of all ages would enjoy this.
