My brother insisted that I try this buffet and so I did.  I was waiting on my parents and we got to the buffet around 8pm...the host told me there would be a 45 minute wait....I was hungry but it was up to my parents if they wanted to wait - and they didn't mind - however during the time I was asking them, I let this group of four go ahead of me - and I guess I was lucky because one of the girl from that group gave me a receipt or birthday voucher of some kind that cut my waiting time in half. So I have her to thank for that and we got in line to go in right after. . . We still had to wait in line for about 20 minutes - there was this other line that they opened up next to us and they kept letting the people from that line in immediately - I was thinking they were either guest of the hotel or some kind of VIP because they got this black placard with a diamond on it - looks important. The hostess was reassuring me that I would get our table soon - and after 15 people went in from the other line and 20 minutes later we finally got our table right in front of the steamed crab legs - perfect for my parents because that's pretty much what they eat.. . This buffet was truly amazing in it's selection of foods. There biggest section was Seafood, Asian and Desserts- they had so much seafood choices, I wish I had a big enough stomach to try everything. . . The meats that I've tried - lamb chop was tender and juicy but the beef ribs were a tad chewy and the pork ribs were really dry. All the seafood that I tried (oysters, crab legs, cocktail shrimp and mussel) were fresh and appropriately prepared. I also had a beef slider - tasty! a few of the sushi rolls and salad. . . Overall the food was very fresh and you see them refill it with a fresh batch of food as it runs low. Lots of there food actually do run low so it's a good sign - some buffets have food that sits there for a while but I didn't see that happening here. I didn't eat a whole lot of desserts since I was already really full with the savories - but I did have room for a macaroon, mango pudding and creme brulee. Yummy Yummy definitely filled my tummy that night.  This buffet is fairly new so we'll have to wait a couple of years to see if it will go downhill - but at $50 a person I really hope not. I've been to both Bellagio's and Wynn's and they were great before too but the quality has gone down a notch.
Was way too excited too excited to come to this place with the hubby. Paid $110.00 for food that was sub par. Nothing looked excepetionally good and nothing tasted too great either. Dessert bar was a total let down. Presentation of items were nice but lacked in flavor, how can u really go wrong with flan. Wish i would have did a tour of this place before i decided to eat. Oh well at least i had the experience but this place is definately not worth the mula!
After trying out the other competitor buffet "Wicked Spoon", Bacchanal is hands down the best eye candy and yummy in your tummy buffet place to go.  It doesn't matter what time of day you go, their food is totally worth the money your paying for and the consitency is there.  I hope the next time we come back this summer, their creme brulee has improved.
I would probably give this place more stars if it wasn't for the tacky and cheap inside decorations! It is very small inside for the price I was expecting it to be elegant but the station casinos have better decor than this place. Tiny plain tables and chairs are dirty. Don't believe all the hype about this place half the stuff that you see in these yelp pictures are no longer available. I'm sure they did when they first opened but then stopes caring about what they serve.  The desert where the best part. They did serve a few different items I haven't seen served at a buffet before but everything else is pretty typical to a standard buffet. Not worth the 50 dollars a person.
Even if you're hungover get there early so you don't have to wait in an extremely long line!!! This is without a doubt my favorite buffet in Vegas! I has every type of food and it is so freaking high class. I want to go thereagain right now! If you're in Vegas and want to know where the best buffet is it is definitely the Bacchanal Buffet at the Caesar's Palace.
Dinner price ; $50.99/person. . The price to quality of food ratio is what knocks this buffet down 2 stars. . . We arrived shortly before 6pm on a Wednesday night. This was a perfect time. When we left, the line was crazy!. . The longest line of the buffet was at the "American" BBQ station. They had great sausages and ribs there. . . The 2nd best section was the Asian one. . . The rest was underwhelming. The Italian was just a couple of thin crust pizzas and a really gross orecchiette pasta dish. Salad station was plain and boring. Seafood smelled awful. And the dessert station was more cookies than interesting desserts. I didn't even bother with dessert.. . I left full, yet unsatisfied. We are going to try a different buffet tonight.
Good food selection and quality of good is much better than most buffets around. The ribeye I had was very dry but I got the end of it. My buddy had a fresh one and it was juicy. Nice venue, good selection, and quality. Well worth with it. The reason for only three stars is because the service we had was very poor. Cashiers made an error on check regarding gratuity and we said we'd pay cash but the person seating us rudely disregarded us and wouldn't seat us until that was fixed. Their fault anyways. Very rude service on that end. I am big on customer service and this one failed horribly.
I'm a native to Las Vegas having lived here my entire life, over 40 years. I grew up in the hotel and gaming community and if there is a buffet in Vegas, I'm sure I've eaten at it. So when I heard all the hype about the Bacchanal Buffet (named after the old Bacchanal restaurant of Caesars Palace ages ago) I was dying to try it. I've already experienced several of the other major buffets in Las Vegas such as the one at the Bellagio and my personal favorite, Wicked Spoon over at Cosmo, so my hopes were high for this place. I must say, my high hopes were let down.. . My first experience with the Bacchanal Buffet was about a month after it opened. My wife and I decided to go down and check it out. It was mid-week, about 7 PM when we arrived. Much to my amazement, the line to get in looked like the line for the Matterhorn at Disneyland on Labor Day weekend. My jaw hit the ground when I found out it would be a THREE HOUR WAIT to get in. That's right, a THREE HOUR WAIT! I'm sorry, there is no buffet in the history of the world worth that. Anyone willing to stand in such a line needs to get their head examined. Oh, but wait, for an extra few bucks you can pay to get into a shorter line...what an insult! We left, but not before I asked to speak to a restaurant manager about this insanity. . . A young woman, still in her 20's introduced herself as the head assistant manager. I questioned why they had a line this long and didn't use a pager system or numbers or something like that. Hello?! They came up with these ideas 30 years ago! This girl looked at me like I was speaking Martian. The mere concept of this went so far over her head she looked like a deer in headlights. Evidently, this is the new system that Caesars Palace has implemented...get rid of anyone with experience or knowledge of the industry because they cost too much and, instead, hire kids right out of college with a Hospitality degree to run a multi-million dollar restaurant as a General Manager for $50,000/year. This is what happens when your flag-ship property is run by amateurs after a buy out. It's like McDonalds trying to run a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse like a McDonalds. Insane. After this brief conversation that went nowhere, we left.. . Fast forward a few months, it was my birthday. My wife knew I wanted to go to the Bacchanal so she took me there as we decided to give it a second try. We went on a Wednesday at 8PM. The hotel was empty but there was still an atrocious 45 minute wait. INSANE. Once inside, our first impression was that it was very nice inside but nothing special. We actually were shocked at how small the seating area was, which would probably explain why the turnover of tables was so slow.. . the food was wonderful but in many cases it suffered the same problems that many buffets suffer from and that's batches of food left under heat lamps. Much of the food was hot but much of it was barely warm. The crab legs were a nice touch but by far nothing special. I've had better at Red Lobster or Joes Crab Shack. Seriously, no joke.  The desserts were certainly the high point of the buffet and we enjoyed several of the different offerings.. . My overall experience of the Bacchanal Buffet was that it was a fair value for the price but the insanely long wait to get in dropped what would be a 4 star review down to a 2 star. It is not worth the wait...not even close. What baffles the mind though is how not one executive at Caesars Palace has not screamed at them over this process. You have people waiting in line for HOURS when they could be putting money in slot machines or playing the tables. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I'm amazed that people haven't been fired over this and I'm even more amazed that the wait process still exists. It's run by idiots with no common sense.. . Sarah Jane, one of the top reviewers of this restaurant is even a good friend of mine and because of her relationship with Yelp, she got right in and never had to wait for the gruelingly long line to eat here. She has even told me that if she had to wait an hour or more to eat here she would have dropped her review down a lot too. . . My wife and I eat at nice restaurants all the time and the price tag to eat at the Bacchanal seems fair minus the long line. Until they expand with more tables to accommodate more people and change the line system we will not return. We much prefer Wicked Spoon.
Caesars has always had a good buffet but this is FAB-U-LOUS!   It is pricey but worth it.  Go hungry and make sure you have time to spend.  They have different types of crab, asian and small snow crab legs which are cold unless you ask the staff behind the counter to dip your legs in hot water.  They are very small but good.  The shrimp were very good and very large.  It is a lovely place and staff was great.  Went for Sunday brunch and you get  mimosas with the meal which were very good.  I will return again even though it's pretty expensive.  Loved it!
Overall: swanky buffet but it's not as tasty as it looks. . Pros. -all kinds of food. - gelato is super tasty. - mushroom truffle soup. -charcuterie station. -crepe station. . Cons. - the seafood was rather sad/ bad. - no crab legs. - lines for anything like prime rib or tacos take forever . . . Sidenote: . -come if you have no plans, lines are so long it's hard to say when you'd get out of here. - quality is lacking, especially when you are paying this much for a buffet
This Vegas buffet in Caesar's palace lives up to all the hype - it met and exceeded my food expectations.  The selection is so incredibly vast - it's overwhelming to choose.  I just loaded my plate!  From Chinese pork buns, to steak and eggs, to red velvet pancakes, to the most incredible mussels and crabs, to pho, to sushi.... I don't even remember because I just ate so much.  All I remember is that it was worth every penny at Bacchanal Buffet. The food was truly delicious and you should not miss out on their ceviche -- it had SO.MUCH.FLAVOR!!  This buffet is not just some restaurant... it's a destination.
Love this buffet! Probably my favorite with Wicked Spoon close second. So much to choose from and all of it good. I love their desert bar. Love the small portion of food so you can decide if you like it without so much waste.
This is the most amazing buffet I've ever been to. They have something for everyone from fish to meat to italian, mexican, sushi and dim sum ... My husband and I spent two hours here tasting everything! Our server was so wonderful and attentive he offered us coffee when we were eating our dessert. Everything tasted fresh and it was gourmet, there mashed potatoes weren't boxed they're dessert selection was phenomenal. You could eat all the cookies, cakes, and gelato your heart desired. I can't wait to come back to Vegas just so we can eat at the bacchanal buffet again!!!
Came here thinking the lines would be long, but to our surprise, we waited 10 minutes the most at the pay line and 20 minutes to get seated. We just touched down in Vegas, driving for 5 hours, traffic on and off the whole way, we were HONGRY! . . I went straight to the oysters and got myself a plate full, some crab legs and ceviche. YUM!! I loved the oysters, definitely fresh. I ate about 30 that night. I wanted to go back the next day for more.. . All the other foods were okay, but I'm glad the buffet was huge and had lots of diff selections. My son loved the spicy Mac n cheese (he's 15 months old). My fiance loved the wagyu sliders.. . Oh and the fresh juices!! Soooo good! Wicked spoon doesn't have anything like it. Before trying bacchanal, I loved wicked spoon, but I can now say I found my new fav!!
I wish Yelp would allow video reviews because a walkthrough of this buffet would be epic.  Just to walk from one side of the buffet all the way to the end while taking cursory glances at each item took me 3 whole minutes. Let's go through this:. . Ambiance: Everything you expect of a Vegas buffet: upscale and decadent. Cloth tablecloths and napkins and chandeliers made of wine glasses.. . Service: The waiters very quick with water and drinks though in a buffet setting I'm usually in a get-out-of-my way type of mentality (jk). . FOOOOODDD: The selection here is amazing. Especially the amount of Asian food that was provided (dim sum, sushi, ramen, zhongzi, stir fry, etc).  And for everyone who complained about food selection, they were obviously not there for the dinner spread. Once dinner hits, the selection of raw oysters, king crab, and mussels come out, with crab being offered both freshly steamed and on the ice.. . One tip I have is to come around 2-2:30 as dinner spread comes out at 3:00pm.  A lot of people pile in around 2:45 and hold up the line so I suggest coming a little earlier than that.  Bacchanal doesn't close in the middle of the day like Wicked Spoon does ( on the weekdays) so this trick would only work here. And besides, who wakes up in time for early lunch in Vegas anyway??. . Overall, best. buffet. ever. If I could somehow live here, I would.
This place made me want to sleep in here. Came to get a reservation ticket. The wait said an hour, lady at the front hooked it up and let us in 5 mins after we got the tickets. The food is pretty good, but the desserts were so damn bomb. Probably gained 20pounds, but was so worth the $50 each. A must buffet destination to go in vegas.
This buffet is epic! One of the top 10 in my list! You can find right about anything! I went for brunch and man it was the best! The staff is friendly and the vibe is wonderful! The dessert section is it a bit small but it's still great! Go here you won't regret it!
Every meal in Vegas is pretty overpriced. The Bacchanal buffet is no exception, on it's surface. I mean, $50 each? Dang. But then you break it down by line item and it's really not such a bad deal, especially if you want to try all different things. And if you drink champagne, the mimosa brunch pays for itself. I found the quality to be very good for a buffet, but not great for a $50 meal. I'm rounding up to a 4 because is buffet is one of those things you have to do in Vegas, and this one is better than the rest. . . I took the sage advice of many other reviewers and went around 3pm to get in at the cheaper lunch price. I don't feel like a cheapskate because I still spent mad loot on this meal. This ridiculous meal that filled me up until the next day. My favorite things were:. -the crab legs, obviously. I ate like 5 full crabs. That alone justifies the price tag. . -the carving station. Prime rib, rack of lamb, and a total sausage fest. Sign me up. . -some of the sides. I know, you shouldn't fill up on crap like bread when there's stuff like meat available. But the truffle potatoes were delicious, the sesame edamame held its own, and cheese is good. . . I did not care for:. -the desserts. They all looked better than they tasted and there weren't that many choices.. -the service. What service. . -the complete lack of green/vegetable sides. . The atmosphere of Bacchanal is classy as hell, you can hang out for a few hours and eat like a champion.
This is an extraordinary place, current price of $55 Bacchanal has a large variety of foods to eat! From seafood to BBQ, Italian to Chinese. The food is excellent to a standard of a normal restaurant and not some cheap buffet food.. . The ambience is nice and casual but classy. The Decor is modern and the service is excellent. The waiters are always on top of tier game to give you the best service and never let your drink get half empty.. . After a long day this is a great place to relax and after dinner the dessert bar is by far the best I've had. They even have homemade mochi ice cream.... . Bacchanal is a must when coming to Vegas.
This buffet is a MUST for anyone wanting to eat buffet in Vegas. Their selection is absolutely huge, there is definitely something for everyone here. Seafood, Asian, Mexican, American, Italian, Vegetarian, Charcuterie, Greek...etc. . Make sure to set aside a few hours for this buffet. The lines can be up to an hour and a half (maybe more) during peak times and after you are seated, you will not want to leave. . The dessert bar is always amazing and fun, every time I've gone, there is always something new. . Note: other reviews complain about the pricing, however you get what you pay for here, it is by far one of the best buffets
Very weak during lunch. Vegas has too many better options. I wanted to try it cause it's so hyped up right now.. not worth the 2 hour wait on a Sunday. Food was terrible, most of it. Oyster quality sucked. Prime rib was over cooked and salty. Sushi fish was okay, but the rice made it nasty. The steamed crab legs were good, and the yellow curry. Then I enjoyed the green tea and horchata. The dessert section was very weak. Overall this place is pretty small... and I was very disappointed.. . Not worth the hype and I probably won't be back.
Been to this buffet twice as well as many other Vegas buffets including Wynn Buffet, Spice Market, Wicked Spoon, etc... Let me tell you. Bacchanal is the BEST buffet in Vegas hands down. The first time I went literally changed my understanding of buffets. When I went a second time, it managed to change my understanding again. The food is amazing. The selection is amazing. You will have a dining experience that you will remember.. . Is this worth the $50-$60 price tag? To me, yes. But what does it all matter? You are in Vegas. Unless Vegas is a monthly trip for you, it does not make sense to count pennies and dollars. Pay the extra $10 or so and enjoy a truly premium experience.
I'm not sure where Bacchanal stands in the ranking of all Las Vegas buffets (it's the only one I've been to). But in the grand scheme of buffets, Bacchanal has to be the best I've ever had. We went at an odd hour to stuff ourselves before our flight (they were serving lunch) so the line wasn't terrible, but nevertheless it moved quickly.. . The only disappointment I had was probably my fault. I had watched several videos (haha) and browsed Yelp photos of people touring the buffet, displaying the things they served. But I suspect because it was a weekday and lunch, several items were missing (most notably crab and other seafood!) that I was really looking forward to. I still ate a disgusting amount and felt terrible, yet happy afterwards.. . I would list everything I ate, but I think I actually tried EVERYTHING--plus, there's a bounty of photos available already of what they offer. What I would recommend is staying away from all the French fries and pizza; they're decent, but you can get great fries and pizza elsewhere. I DO, however, recommend the little cheeseburgers! The sushi isn't terrible and if you stick with nigiri, you do get a good value. The ramen is also a nice find--so many people bypass it because you have to wait a little bit/interact with a human to get your food, so I got it pretty much on the spot. It was decent :). . As for the desserts...just ask for a sample of EVERY gelato flavor. They'll give it to you! But I recommend the thai tea flavor.
I have to say, good job Ceasers for FINALLY making a buffet that *should* be in a place like yours.  I've been wanting to go since it was announced that they were even making it and then the reviews came out.  But the last time I was in Vegas, they had just opened, and it was NYE weekend so we didn't even venture to the strip (I was staying with a friend who lives in Vegas).  But this time, we were staying across the street.  There was NO WAY I was going to miss out.. . Dinner during the weekend is about $55, Sunday Brunch was $45.  I think.  You get like a dollar or two off with your Total Rewards membership card.. . There is a virtual queue - you will see the computers set up.  Make sure to go up and pull a ticket.  This will tell you when to come back to get back in line to pay and then get seated.  There are NO SIGNS for this or anyone telling you to do it.  I'm sure it's not as crazy during the week but on the weekends, this is a must.. . When my friend and I were there Friday night pretty late and we had NO problems getting in.  We didn't even know about the virtual queue.  But on Saturday when we returned with more friends, we were denied entry and it was only 730pm.  They had already filled up their virtual queue and were not letting anyone else get in line.  It was basically sold out.  We had talked to a lady in line and she said that they were there at 6, got a ticket and it said to come back at 8.  The buffet closes at 1030pm.  Since we were hungry, we left and went to another place for dinner.  . . However, we did return Sunday for brunch before we left town. . . Now on to the food!. . There are several stations:. . Seafood - oysters on the half shell, crab legs (cold and warmed up with hot water at request), shrimp, and various other seafood dishes.  There is a warm drawn butter machine for you!. . Italian - pizza, pasta, meatballs and a made to order pasta station. . Asian - an assortment of dim sum items (buns, shumai, etc) plus the usual chinese fare - kung pao chicken, chow mein, fried rice etc. also had some pad thai and some other meat options that I don't remember. A small assortment of sushi (there was definitely more fish on the sushi during dinner than brunch) There is also a noodle station to order where you can get udon, pho or ramen.. . Carving station - there is so much meat here, your head will spin.  Prime Rib, baby back ribs, smoked brisket, smoked turkey, a variety of sausage links, lamb chops.  During brunch, they had more sausage varieties, but I had to wait until it was closer to lunch time to get some brisket and ribs.  I asked the guy carving and he went in the back and got them.  I had turkey on Friday dinner but they had run out of the brisket (since we were close to closing time).  Both were really good.. . Mexican - you can get tacos to order.  There was also beans, rice, carnitas, machaca, chicken, a salsa bar and a juice bar.. . American -  I don't know what else to call this area - it's where they have the mashed potatoes, veggies, mac and cheese, etc.  They didn't have any fried chicken when we were there for dinner, but at brunch they had it to go with waffles.  There were sweet potato tots, roasted potatoes, french fries. I think i seriously had a plate of potatoes.  There were even baked potatoes available.  Mini sliders (which we were sure they had been sitting for a while) were a little dry.. . Salad bar - I didn't venture too much here - but there was a variety of salads and dressings you could get.  There was also a lot of fruit, a variety of cheese and cured meats.  And a huge area with a variety of bread.. . Dessert - There is a gelato bar with some interesting flavors, crepes to order with plenty of whipped cream, berries, bananas foster and nutella to your hearts content.   During dinner there were macaroons and chocolate covered strawberries but they didn't have it when we were there during brunch.  There is the usual variety of cakes, cookies, brownies, and creme brulee as well.. . I'm sure I missed all sorts of things.  The food was pretty amazing.  There were a few things that we didn't like, but for the most part it was really good.  I mean - we went twice in  a weekend !  Definitely will be back.
I will have to say that I didn't try even half of the food available so they may deserve more than a three. I mostly pigged out at the seafood bar, crab legs mostly. For $60/70 bucks, better get your money's worth right? The oysters weren't anything amazing. They were actually still pretty gritty as they weren't cleaned enough. Their prime rib was no where melt in your mouth and their lamb, though flavorful, I couldn't get pass the tough meat. It will definitely give your jaw muscles a workout. . . I LOVE their little juice jars, watermelon is my favorite. They also serve a Peach Green Tea or something, ask your server. It's freaken awesome, so refreshing. The dessert bar was a let down. They didn't have the regular creme brulee that all you yelpers raved about; they had a green tea version which was a 3. Strawberries huge (chemicals!) and not sweet. I honestly forgot what else I ate. I guess you can say that really tells you how much I liked their desserts.. . The service was really good though. Both our servers were super nice and checked up on us often.
Was out in Vegas on business, and I've been to a few buffets out there, actually went to Bellagio's this time out.  Let me tell you, Bellagio's buffet was good, but this is on another level.. . Went for lunch, during the week, was about $45 or so, don't remember exactly, but it was worth every penny.  They have pretty much everything you can imagine, setup in stations.  Do yourself a favor, bring your appetite and scout it out before diving in to make sure you are able to try everything you want to, otherwise you will get full way too quickly.. . This was the best buffet, I've ever seen in Vegas, maybe anywhere, everything was on point, tasty, and I'd definitely go back.  Easily worth the price tag.
Read the rave reviews and had to go.  The food was ok and only two hot items that rocked my boat were the chicken and waffles and the chorizo potatoes - best I ever had.  The rest of the food was old and crusty from sitting under the heating lamps.  The freshest piece of food was the watermelon and pineapple.  For this price, I expected much more.  Decor and ambiance is divine.  Excellent customer service and great dessert bar.
Bachelor party with my boys, came here for breakfast. It was my second creme brulee, dug in, tastes bad. Egg inside tasted and looked rotten. I Tell manager, she says this week is pistachio flavor!?! She leaves to checks with chefs. Comes back, says " oh no it's green tea". Right...cause that's how it should taste. Horrible customer service. Tried todeny the buffet has issues. I'm insulted she thinks as an adult i can't tell the difference between rotten, pistachio, or green tea. Second time here and this happens. How do you make a creme brulee with top yellow and bottom this nasty green color? Aside from THIS, buffets really nothing special to me. I prefer Bellagio.
The first few times, I loved it.  But after the 8th or 9th time, it's not worth going anymore, especially after they raised their prices.. . I'm a Las Vegas Local and everyone wants to try this place. Unlimited mimosas for brunch on the weekends, lunch serves a lot of the same things as dinner, but dinner sometimes offers more seafood. . . + biggest shrimp I've ever seen. + Oysters!. + Dim sum and sushi. + Carving station. + Taco Bar. + Dessert Bar with a crepe station and gelato ice cream. + fresh juice. + Awesome sliders. + Pho/ramen bar. . I'm giving this 3 stars mainly because the allure of the restaurant has declined on me. I still think it's the best buffet in Las Vegas still...but honestly, I'm buffet'd out and there are other places I'd rather eat (see my other Yelp reviews).  I will tell you this: If any visitors ask me to go to Bacchanal again, I'm going to say "no, thanks!" Also, I honestly cannot eat $50-$70 worth of food (because that's about what you should expect to pay after tax). . . Here's a tip: Don't go on Friday or Saturday nights.  If you must, then head straight to the kiosk and put your name down. Take the receipt and they will text you when it's time to queue up. The last food trays come out at 10 PM and are taken away at 10:30PM. . . If you must go to a buffet, pick this one over all the others.
I don't normally like buffets - I never eat enough to get my money's worth, but everyone keeps talking about Bacchanal..sooo I had to try it! Loved it! Was it worth the $60? If you're gonna eat at a buffet and spend $40-50 then you might as well eat here! . . You must go there, get a ticket and then come back for the assigned time you have on your ticket. That way people aren't waiting in a massive line. We got there at 3pm on a Saturday and the earliest time available was 5:40pm.. . I came here for dinner, mostly for the fresh oysters everyone kept raving about. It was definitely good and fresh, unlike other buffets.. . Lamb chops were also very good. I don't usually like lamb because it's too gamey for my liking, but these were so good! . . They also had steamed mussels! Omgggg I couldn't stop eating them.. . I had plates after plates of mussels, crab legs, and oysters!. . Then I headed over to get some desserts. I liked this green tea cake they had and the macaroons were good too! Creme brulee! A good selection of gelato! . . Oh and they had juices in these cute bottles! I grabbed the guava one and I really liked it!
For those who are planning to eat Bacchanal Buffet, I have recorded a FULL EXTENSIVE HD Slow and Steady Walk-Through of the entire buffet station at Bacchanal buffet in Caesars Palace. (Probably the best crisp HD footage on YouTube Guarantee).  So if you guys want to see what they serve for dinner before you guys dine there, click on the YouTube link to see the Bacchanal buffet in HD:. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eGQUhz-ChA. . or you can go on Youtube and Type "Epic Buffet Feast - Bacchanal Buffet Full HD tour". . It was kind of pricey at almost $45 bucks with taxes.  I ate here for brunch at around 2:30pm and got to eat for dinner also because Dinner starts at 3pm. So instead of paying for dinner price I paid at a brunch price. In the video, you will see both the brunch food and the dinner food that they brought out. HINT: If you don't want to pay dinner price, dine during the lunch hours and wait a bit before the bring out the dinner food.. . I had a great time eating at this truly epic buffet as mentioned by their ads in and around the casino. . We had a great server, who always would come by and clear the plates.. . I love their open kitchen design. It's so clean and modern. I love how the foods were displayed and presented instead of having them on aluminum tray at the station for us to go and grab it. All the crab legs were already sliced in half, so you don't need a claw cracker. The only complained was that I wish the crab legs were steam instead of being cold.. . They even have street taco! and a whole bunch of salsas to choose from as you can see halfway through my video. I love their rotating grill where they cook your tacos. . . They also have the best dessert bar in term of dessert presentation. . . Overall, I love this place. It makes me feel like I'm living the high life.. . So here's a smooth steady HD videos of the whole buffet:. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eGQUhz-ChA. . Enjoy!
I'll say this is the #1 buffet in Las Vegas at least for now! The food is really tasty and fresh. They have more variety than any other buffet in Las Vegas. The interior design is just stunning! Really love it!!!
There was a sign infront that boasted "Voted best Buffet in Vegas" I call B/S. At best I thought the food quality was okay. I don't see why people go nuts for this buffet but if I had to take a guess, I'd say its for the variety of options. Without a doubt the largest buffet I've ever been too. The buffet is separated into sections dedicated to different cuisines like Chinese, Italian, Thai, and they even a pho station. There's a seafood section & a meat carving station like other buffets. The dessert station was the largest & proly my favorite part. Nothing I ate was bad but nothing was really good either. I tried as much as I could but there wasn't one thing that I would tell someone else "oooh you gotta try this." I like having all these options but what I would have really liked would have been a good meal worth paying $50 a head for.. . This is something I'd do once for the experience but I doubt I'd return. Not big on buffets and the food quality was blah. Plus the line was ridiculously long. The wait during peak lunch/dinner hours can be upwards of 3 hours. like whoa!
We ate here not long after it was remodeled, it is very pricey for dinner will cost you for just two people 100 bucks.  Not worth the price to me and we had horrible drink service, we had to go to the hostess twice to tell her to get someone to rrefill our drinks cause the guy who had our table just kept going around to all the other tables and ignoring ours even after the first time the hostess told him he still didnt learn his lesson.   Food was just ok but then again that  whole drink experience could have ruined my food experince cause i didnt want to eat to much if i didnt have anything to drink it down with nad what not. My boyfriend seemed to like the food but not at that price plus he still says the Aria Buffet is better andI do have to agree and there you never have to worry about your bevereages been filled they are on ttop of it unlike here.
Regardless of what the food will taste like. I paid $15 extra per person for a party of 3 to skip the line & currently waiting in a line. That's $45 that I'll never get back. . . Here's a tip, just wait in line next time & don't waste money on the expedited line charge. It will save you time compared to waiting, but was it worth $15 extra. Absolutely not.. . I'll do a follow up review for food up next.. . Just sat down. First off, customer service is excellent without a doubt. Keep in mind, I'm not paying the $30 price for this buffet, more like $45, so my expectations were already heightened. . . The food is good, along with the variety, but freshness was lacking. Their Seabass dish wasn't tender & really tasted old, but still tasted good, but not as fresh(as in cooked) as it could be. The best tasting thing was their truffled potatoes. Lots of desert options which also another plus!. . The food is more like a $20 range buffet & not even close to the $45 that I paid. . . I came here because "USA Today" rated it as the best Buffet. Now I don't think I'll trust USA Today anymore
Best Vegas buffet I have been to so far. (I have not been to wicket spoon but most of my party did and they agreed it was better) They do a check-in type reservation that requires you to walk up to a kiosk with all your details and tells you when to come back. I suggest come 1.5 hours before you want to eat - it's a way better system than forcing people to wait in a line for an hour.. . Seafood is definitely a highlight here. My favorites were:. Oysters were super fresh, Crab legs for DAYS (be sure to walk to the back and get some steamed!), Scallops, Sea Bass and Clams served many different ways.. . The meat was good, delicious, and juicy. I really enjoyed the lamb chops and prime rib. . . Taco station was actually pretty good but be careful and don't fill up on the cheaper stuff!. . Don't waste your time with the sushi, it was okay but I have definitely had better at sushi joints (typical of almost any buffet). . There were a ton of desserts, most of them good, nothing life-changing.. . Service was spectacular. Our waiter took care of our table of 11 with ease and barely left any plates after 2 minutes of completion.. . The seafood selection and flavor is bomb.com. I tried almost everything else there, and it was mostly all good. I stuck away from their chinese/thai food since I was being asian and eating my $68 dollars worth - ouch. I will definitely be back!
I came here after hearing the rumors that this is the "best buffet in Vegas." Let me preface my review with the fact that I am a pescatarian, a recession-era college graduate, who doesn't drink and I was underwhelmed with my experience here.. . I checked out the tips on Yelp, which advised me to arrive early so that I could get a ticket before paying and being seated (thanks, Yelpers!). My boyfriend and I grabbed our tickets from one of the kiosks next to the hostess's podium, which is already pretty confusing as people were fumbling around, wondering how to get seated at the Holy Grail of Vegas buffets. Of course, we checked in at 1p so we would have enough time to embrace the brunch price tag (with the unlimited mimosas for my beau) and stay for the beginning of their dinner service. We werenotified via text exactly 70 minutes after we got our ticket (as promised) that our seats will be held for 15 minutes. We made it in the nick of time and, luckily, there was no line to pay. We were asked to pose for souvenir pictures in front, which we were later solicited to purchase for $25 during our meal - just because we are eating here does not mean we want to spend $25 to commemorate our excessive spending on excessive eating! We were seated pretty quickly, as there were plenty of vacant tables around the restaurant.. . The selection was tragically lackluster. There were the standard staples of most buffets (e.g. salad bar, pizza station, hamburger sliders, crab legs, sushi, pastries) with stations for meat-carving, meat and cheese, dim sum, udon/ramen, and southern comfort food (i.e. corn on the cob, tater tots, etc.). As a pescatarian who doesn't like shellfish, you could imagine how limited my options were. There were about 5 types of rolls to choose from [including pickled vegetables (seriously?!), imitation crab (come on!), spicy tuna], and then a few choices of nigiri (salmon, tuna, and shrimp). The dim sum selection was pitiful and I'm pretty sure the har gow had been frozen. My boyfriend loved the shumai.. . We moseyed on over to the seafood station and grabbed some salmon and some sort of unmarked whitefish, both of which we decided not to finish after one bite. My boyfriend excitedly filled his plate with the selections from the meat-carving station only to find out that most of the lamb chop had been fat and it was underwhelming, despite the grand presentation.. . Now onto the desserts -- they have a crepe station, which I was really excited about until I realized that they cook the crepes for you and then you slather on preserved berries, bananas, and cool whip to your liking - where's the nutella? Why didn't they put fresh fruit in them for me like a real creperie would have? Oh, right, I paid $50 to do it myself... I also tried their gelato, which was pretty delicious, but they were distributed in small servings (smaller than my fist), which, in retrospect, is probably wise since people are probably stuffed by the time they reach dessert. Their vanilla with fleur de sel and salted caramel flavors are delicious! They also have a create-your-own ice cream sandwich option with chocolate cookies or almond cookies, which was a pretty neat option.. . Essentially, this buffet is not pescatarian/vegetarian-friendly. I ended up filling up on spicy tuna rolls and cocktail shrimp with dabbling in new, disappointing dishes in between before giving up and diving into the desserts. I am also disappointed that their brunch selection was more "-unch" than "br-," as they did not have many "traditional" breakfast options (other than dim sum and red velvet pancakes).. . My favorites from this place were the juices they had in adorable individual carafes (guava, mango, cranberry, to name a few) and their ice cream, I guess. . If you're looking for high prices, limited selection, and even less satisfying quality, this is the place to be! Nothing in this buffet seemed notable or worth coming back for. My boyfriend mainly liked his sliders that he topped with their guacamole, but seriously? I'm not going to pay $50 for sliders, juice, and gelato.. . I'm glad we tried it so that we know what "the best buffet in Vegas" is really like, so we can go back to The Bellagio with $20 more in our pockets and Beef Wellington and sushi hand rolls in our stomachs!
Best Buffet I experienced in Vegas! You have to be open minded to trying new and gourmet foods very ethnic foods. Everything was cooked to perfection! It was very spendy but worth every Penny!
Not worth it!!  We had the buffets of buffets pass. Gets you into quite a few different places for $50. We were told that there was a $10 up charge for this particular Buffett. When we got there we were charged $30 extra per person. What????  But we thought hey it's supposed to be awesome so let's do it. . . It was very sub par. The Buffett at the Rio is larger and has more variety. This one is mostly Asian food and seafood. It also took the waiter 20 mins to take our drink order. I will not return and I will be talking to someone about the outrageous up charge.
Its definitely the most expensive buffet i have visited in las vegas so far... wait times can be long on some days, but pretty extensive food selection, huge butcher block, very lovely atmosphere/setting. I would definitely go back, just not a once a week/month kind of place caus it is expensive,  more like a once a year for a special occassion buffet in my opinion.
I had these place talked up to me non stop by my friend before i came here.  Im sure that in some way affected my feelings on it.  In Las Vegas with a buffet around every corner you have to be exceptional to stand out.  And although this place was good I didn't think it was exceptional.  Food was very fancy.  I found them lacking in some of the basics.  Like normal pancakes.  Never seen a brunch buffet without normal pancakes.  The tables were all fairly close together so getting up to go to the buffet was  sometimes more of a chore then it should have been.  A lot of theitems came on their own little plate.  Which seemed like an odd choice since its tricky to get more then one item when you can just put it on one larger plate.  Maybe a cafeteria tray would be a good idea.  . . Bottom line.  Lay out is strange.  Decore feels kinda like fancy Ikea.  Price is high.  I think for me Rio is still my favorite vegas brunch. Ill have to try this place for dinner and see if it changes my mind.
You know when you get all amped up to go to one of the all you can eat lobster feasts in Orlando and when you are done wonder why I wasted $50 on a so-so buffet?  With my first (and probably last) visit to the Bacchanal, I am thinking the same.  While the food was actually quite good, it definitely wasn't worth the $50.  Not much selection, "hot" crab legs were lukewarm, two full stations with Asian offerings limiting variety of rest of buffet, dessert bar smaller than most other buffets I have experienced, and the traffic flow was confusing.  I have experienced better in other Midwest and southern casinos.  If this is the best Las Vegas has to offer, the reviewers must not travel extensively.  It was ok but I would not go out of my way to eat there again.  Noticed that not much of a line and no wait at 5:30.
They get 2 stars because our dining service was good.  Went here for a friend's birthday because she was excited about a full blown extravaganza for her birthday dinner.  The only thing full blown about the place is the price. . . It was less busy than most people have experienced but because there were 5 of us, after we paid, we had to wait for about 15 minutes before we were seated.  We get seated and I looked around and realized how small this buffet is compared to others.  And every section seems to have a line and those that don't for their particular foods, have a line in front of them for another section.  Some of the lines just to get the more popular food took more than 15 minutes to navigate.  . . The sad part: It isn't all that good.  The desserts were tasty but the actual FOOD... not so much.  I had cold food that was warm and warm food that was cold.  Bread that had been left out for too long and was stale.  One of my friends had a couple of the sliders and pushed the rest of her plate away.  . . Honestly, it is a 1.5 star place.  One star for the service, .5 for the desserts.  Had I paid for just a dessert buffet, this would be a different story.  But since most of us went away hungry because the food was not good, I cannot recommend this buffet to anyone.  I honestly feel like people like it because it is expensive.  They feel like they must be eating some really upscale food.  But here is a note:  the food still has to taste good.  One does not need to eat it just because it is expensive.
Fruits and deserts are wonderful. Wait time is short and the price is fairly low. Downside is that not too many sea food choices.
Best Buffet in Vegas!
Average food. Lackluster in taste. Just like most buffet everything over salted. Dessert was below average. Nice decor though. By the way, got cold coffee.
Pros:. . 1. Good quality food and nice atmosphere.  The sweet potato fries and ratatouille are truly great. Also, some excellent desserts and other dishes.. . . Cons:. . 1. Overpriced.  For my money, the M and the Wynn are generally better values  (especially, the M) and also have outstanding food. And I've tried all the top buffets.. . 2. Food is COLD!  In an attempt to be hip, they put food in metal pans under heat lamps rather than on steam tables.  This means the food is lukewarm, if you're lucky.  They give you these little blue silicone finger grabber/protectors as if the pots will be scalding hot. You won't need them.. . 3. Service was shockingly indifferent and poorly trained.  Asked for lemons (for the iced tea) three times.  On the third attempt, she told me where I could find them myself.  I asked her if she recognized me.  She said, "no."  I told her that was because I didn't work there.. . When I told another waitress about the cold food, she told me to tell the cooks, that her only job was to bring drinks.. . Asked to see the manager who was pleasant and offered a free cocktail.  We told her we weren't complaining to get something for free (not that that was why she was offering).  She was nice, but we didn't get the feeling she was all that concerned.. . Was really looking forward to this place.  Never again.
We went for breakfast and it was amazing. They had a lot to choose from and everything we got was hot. They had something for everyone steak and eggs, lobster biscuit and gravy is a must try. The red velvet pancakes are amazing. They also have a full dessert bar and watermelon juice to drink. It was well worth the price. Show your m-card for a little discount.
I am foodie.. Therefore have tried several different buffets when in vegas..... And this is now officially my favorite one!! Oysters, oyster shooters, shrimp, ratatouille .. OMG!!! The list goes on and on... Salivating while typing this!! Its that impactful.
Amazing, great service by Emma!!! She was very kind & very professionals made the first impression what it should be. The food was ok, I really was not wowed!! To pay this much, & not be wowed is a bummer. Ok, great variety, but not great taste. I gave four stars because of excellent service & Emma!! Other than that, a lot of bells & whistles, but no wow factor. The endless memosa has gotten me ready to roll though. Good set up before the KA show. Let's see how that's gonna be
So, I wanted to see what the hype was all about, about this "epic" buffet. I'm a foodie I like to go to different buffets. I took my family on a Friday afternoon around 2:30pm payed for Iunch $34.99 and dinner starts right away at 3pm Let me start off with the positive, very clean, great selection of food (king crab cold, snow crab legs hot, jumbo shrimp, mexican station was delicious, bbq station smelled incredible like I was at a family reunion, thai, asian and dessert were very good) but not worth how much they charge. Employees not so friendly!! I won't ever come again. I'll stick to the M resort
Bacchanal is one of those places that restores people's faith in buffets. . . There was of course a line getting in. The electronic ticketing system that tells you when to come back is a bit difficult to use but makes plenty sense - except that you should not only rely on it. We got there around 2:33, our ticket said wait till 3:59, so we shopped around for a bit. Then we saw people that arrived after us getting in sooner! It turns out you can ask the manager next to the ticketing station if you can get in earlier, and they will sometimes just let you (maybe due to no shows?) we got in around 3:15, which was much earlier than expected. . . The buffet is a bit too pricey in my opinion, but honestly, that's not gonna stop most people: you don't eat buffet everyday, so why not treat yourself to the good stuff? .  . As many reviewers have mentioned, the highlights are the seafood and the prime rib, but that wasn't all that was good: the Kobe beef burger, the gelato ice cream, the made to order tacos all stood out in my opinion. . . Service seemed to be a hit or miss for us - our first waiter got our drinks wrong twice, and didn't seem too attentive. Our second waitress switched shifts with the first, and was definitely better: making sure our drinks were ok, and gave us the whole pot when we asked for hot water and coffee. . . What makes this buffet better than others? I think it's consistency - while there isn't as much variety compared to other buffets, all the things I tried were not too bad or pretty great. Of course individually, they cannot compare to say a Michelin 3 star restaurant, but this is definitely above par food. . . I don't think I'm gonna have another buffet meal anytime soon, but if I have to, this is the one I would choose.
I have been here a couple of times but the overall score was a 3. The food was good but not spectacular. The Asian selection for the food was pretty tasty and well made and the seafood and desserts were tasty enough not to complain.. . I highly recommend you try the miso sea bass... So tender and it had the perfect balance of sweet. The mini cheeseburger was juicy but the bun was a tad on the dry side. The crab legs were a little on the salty side, but normally everywhere I go it has the same problem. Last time I went they had monte christo sandwiches and red velvet pancakes that were amazing but this time around they weren't there.. The gelato ice cream was tasty and eaten like an appetizer while waiting for our waiter.. The churros tasted as it should but it seemed like it was sitting out in the heat lamp for a while. . The reason the score is so low is two reasons.. Our waiter Miguel had us waiting for 10minutes plus prior to even coming to our table to get our drink orders. We had to wait and even asked a guy walking around who told us "sorry I can't help you, I'm not a waiter". Ok. I get that you're not the waiter but at least TRY and find someone. Our relief at the time? Jie, who even though was NOT our waiter came and got us drinks. The second reason the score wasn't good is the price. For 4 people we paid almost $300 due to Easter prices.. . The only reason I would even consider coming back was the manager Ryan Gross. We saw him on the side and expressed our unhappiness and he was very quick to help us. Let's just say that after he was involved we had people checking up on us and taking care of us like we were actually paying $300 for the meal. . After some issues with our bill he comped us one meal which was greatly appreciated.. . So after all of this? It has a lot of hype but if you go it won't be the best meal but worth it if you don't pay the over priced Easter version.
was debating between which buffet to go to with this Vegas trip and decided on bacchanal after many yelp reviews and pictures viewing. I don't know if I hyped myself up too much or waht but really a 2.5 star. i was not impressed at all. yes there was a lot of food items and yes there were a ton of stations but the food just didn' tlook that fresh. i expected more sushi and sashimi items for $60 a person. Nigiri didn NOT look fresh.. . Seafood bar wasn't that good either. The crab legs didn't taste that good. other items on the hot bars looked dry and kinda old. Dessert wasn't that great either. i've had better buffets for a lot cheaper.
By far the best buffet for the money.  Went for supper and I was not disappointed.  Items from crab to pizza there is something for everyone.  At the carving station they had grilled lamb chops.  I died and went to heaven the best lamb I have ever eaten.  The creamy mushroom truffle soup was also a winner in my book.  I went back for those two items time after time.  Be sure to check out the buffet lines around the corner in the back of the dining hall.  I did not know it was there until after I was stuffed to the gills.  Back there are the pizzas, sushi, Chinese options and salad.  I was excited to taste the desserts and saved a bit of room for them.  Theyfell short on taste and originality.  Cheese cakes, cookies, cookie pops, brownies, puddings and mousses.  They were all just ok I guess I was just expecting more in flavor and uniqueness.  The overall price was well worth it for nothing more than the mushroom soup and lamb chops.  Be sure to try those items when you dine here.
Came here on Easter weekend cause a friend and her family was in town. Totally forgot that buffets jack up the price on holiday weekends. Spent a total of $148 for my bf and I ($74/person). . Was it worth it? Nope!. . Food - Some were good and some were not. Their Asian food was not bad. Sui Mai dishes tasted better than other restaurants I've been too. Their Brie and truffle oil pizza was good but obviously not as great at Sammy's Woodfired Pizza. It would probably taste the same if the crust was thin like theirs. Their seafood section wasn't interesting to me at all. Everything is on ice, miso halibut was super sweet and the lobster chowder was beyond salty. Sushi section, the nigiri weren't bad at all. Desserts are awesome. I love me some rich chocolate!. . Drinks - by the bread station they have a bunch of mini milk bottle type w a variety of juices. Love love love the guava!. . All in all, it was good but nothing to boast about. Would I come back? Definitely not. The price is outrageous.
Huge variety but quality was ok.  Tried a little of everything. Oyster did not taste fresh, prime ribs was no that good, dim sum was below average...etc.... not worth $53
Worth every single penny! Best buffet ever!!!!. . The crab legs (split) are so sweet and flavorful butter isn't necessary. . . Lamb chops are tender, thick and seasoned perfectly. . . The oysters are huge, fresh and delicious.  . . I could continue but it's making me hungry. . . Definitely my favorite buffet for fresh flavorful food.
I read pretty good reviews about this place and was so excited to try it when we arrived in Vegas this past Saturday.  After we checked in at our hotel, this was our first stop.  When we got to the outside of the buffet, we walked straight to this lady who was standing at the podium.  She told us that we had to get a ticket from one of the ticket machines and it'll tell us when to come back for our table.  Well, they should post instructions for people who are new to this buffet.  Everyone was so confused and she had to tell all of them to get a ticket.  When we received a text to come back for our table, the same lady at the podium told us to come back in another 15 minutes.  At that moment, I was starting to get a little aggravated since I was starving.  When we finally got our table, we went straight to the food.  We got pretty much of everything (dim sum, sushi, Chinese food, fruit, pizza, crabs, clam chowder, juice, ham, lamb, clam chowder, chicken in green chilies, Mexican rice, waffle fries, baked potato, macaroni and cheese, maple glazed tator tots, miso seabass and desserts).  Everything was just ok.  There was nothing special about the food.  The dim sum had really thick wrappers.  The lamb was dry.  The seabass, clam chowder and crabs were too salty.  The rice on the sushi and Mexican rice was crunchy in texture.  It seemed like the rice was not fully cooked.  The presentations for the desserts were great, but the flavors were just the opposite.  The only items I enjoyed were the macaroni and cheese, baked potato and the mango juice.  There's a lot of food choices there, but I didn't think I saw 500 items from what I read online.  Our waiter was super nice but I don't think I'll ever come back for the food.
Easily the best buffet in Vegas.. . I've gone to probably 80% of all the buffets in Vegas besides the one in Paris and out of all the ones I've been, this place takes the cake without hesitation. Make sure you come on a weekday, before 6:30PM if you don't want to wait in line and pay over $60-70 a person. Their prices change depending on the weekends, and holidays (DO NOT GO ON A HOLIDAY WEEKEND! THE PRICE GOES TO AROUND 90 A PERSON). Also weekend prices are more expensive as well. If you go Mon-Thurs (not sure about sunday) the price is around 55 a person. DO IT!
Oh gosh. Full. Momentarily shocked Easter weekend brunch was ~$50+ but it was worth it, $1 discount with players card. . . Seafood: just the right amount of salted crab legs, sweet crab claws you have to break/pull apart, unlimited fat cocktail shrimp, green mussels in the half shell, smoked mussels deshelled (serious smokey flavor mmm), a variety of oyster shots, if I recall correctly, etc.. . They have a cheese and salami area! But where are the crackers? Fresh juice bottles near the breakfast foods! I got watermelon.. . I skipped the dim sum, got two pieces of sushi, which actually tasted like they were from a Japanese place, and found it funny I recognized the Krispy Kreme doughnuts next to the waffles, French toast, and mini red velvet pancakes. I'm getting hungry seeing all the food in my mind. . . I couldn't resist and went round the tantalizing dessert station while filling up a third plate (without even eating a single thing yet) and grabbed a huge white chocolate dipped strawberry with pink crunchies, a mini chocolate cupcake, and a raspberry/cream layered dessert that I mistook for red velvet. By the time I got back, Massimo (aka Moss), had already delivered twice the amount of juices/waters we actually needed so we never had to ask for refills. He was friendly and accommodating.. . You must try the lobster Benedict on a biscuit. Make sure to grab the mini plate with the rubber utensil they give you at the cashier, or get one from a basket nearby cuz the plate was hot when I got it! . . I recommend the prime rib, medium? over the brisket and lamb. The latter were dry. There's also pizza and a flatbread with some smoked salmon and capers. Ooh! Their smoked salmon for the mini bagels are shaped into roses and topped with some thin green herb I forget the name of.. . I loved the breakfast tator tots with cheese! The corn beef hash was ok, I bit into one mini waffle fry but it was too salty. I didn't get any breakfast meats to save room. They have chicken and waffles in small frying baskets, similar to Wicked Spoon? I'll let you know if I ever get the chance to eat there. I'm pretty sure you can build your own sandwich because I saw a bunch of sliced bread baskets. . . They truly highlight the seafood aspect of this buffet. When you first enter, they showcase a bunch of seashells and a slight beach theme to prepare the senses for chilled crab legs and claws. . . Dessert. My forte in food. . Get the green tea creme brulee. Absolutely amazing. I liked the pandan tiramisu, slightly more on the exotic side. Stephen, the gelato gentleman, kindly informed us of the many ways to enjoy the gelato: in a cup, between two almond or chocolate cookies, or on a mini cone dipped in Dark Choco with hazelnuts, or one dipped in Vanilla with coconut. I got pistachio gelato with the hazelnut cone and wish I had room for another. So many desserts, so little time! They had three cake pops: chocolate, strawberry, and pineapple tofu cheesecake. Sadly, I wasn't able to try any of them. . There's honestly a dessert for everyone's palette, from fruit or chocolate espresso tarts to green tea cookies, passion fruit/mango mousse in a silver painted eggshell, cake, gelato, etc. They all look too pretty to eat! I'll gladly dine here again.
Great buffet! We upgraded our Buffet of Buffet pass to get breakfast for an additional $15. We got the tail end of breakfast around 10:30am on a Monday. There was a small line, nothing too long. The selection was great, unique. The chicken and waffles was most memorable of breakfast. After that, at exactly 11am the breakfast dishes started to disappear. It sharply switched to lunch except for the guy making omelettes and stacks of bacon on the front end of the buffet. We did stay to try lunch for the full 2 hour max. . . The carver David is great. The bussers are really on it! They make sure my dishes and even my straw sleeves were removed from the table. . . Our waiter barely came around though. Jeff was enthusiastic but the times we needed a refill he wouldn't be there, only when we basically had everything we needed. . . Also, if you're reading 1 star reviews... the one about the "rotten egg creme brulee" is totally bull. There's a sign that says Green Tea Creme brulee and Creme brulee. He obviously got the wrong one. . . I definitely would have loved to try dinner and eat some crab legs. I'm surprised a place like this doesn't have lobster. Or steak knives. I wouldn't pay $60+ for it though.
Other than 500 suckers waiting in a 2 hour line ( I had front of the line passes) this place is top notch, not your typical Vegas buffet!!! Worth every penny$$$$$
Gosh, it's places like this that make me wish I had more than one stomach..... . Bacchanal Buffet, hands down is my absolute FAVORITE buffet in Vegas. At some point in my food trance, I crazily admitted that I wished I could live here! It's that fabulous, and everything comes together---great food, beautifully designed restaurant, and attentive and friendly service.. . Notables:. + Okay, I know that this is a buffet, but there is literally SO MUCH FOOD. I liked that you don't really just get the traditional american buffet food, but they also serve up different types of cuisine as well. Like helllooo, congee station fully equipped with thousand year old egg and chinese donut? Yah, I could probably get a heaping pot of this in Chinatown for $5 but just the presence of this was surprising and pretty well executed. They also have thai food, and even a taco station added to the mix! . + Omfg, crab legs! I hear the complaints that these aren't king crab legs, and yes... while I personally favor king crab over snow crab most days, did anyone mention that these are pretty much pre-shelled for you? Gosh, I guess I've never experienced this before so call me misinformed, but having the half the shell removed so that I could just dig in and eat up made the dining experience that much more pleasant. I'd hate to have the job of the crab de-sheller though.. + Lunch vs. Dinner? I'd do lunch a million times over. No one wants to have a night out with a food baby! Lunch is much cheaper than dinner in all cases, and if you're skeptical about less offerings being available, do the weekend brunch! Bottomless mimosas/champagne/bloody marys make the experience more than worthwhile. . + Again, bottomless mimosas/champagne/bloody marys. YES!. + Dessert is a MUST DO here. I'm not all very fond of sweets, but the desserts they have here are just too good to pass up. Cookies, gelato, all sorts of different sweets to tickle your fancy. I've heard that they do macarons too, but they weren't available the day we were there. I loved all the flavors of gelato though, both the tried and true along with the uniquely uncommon. I sampled and loved both the sour cherry and the mango lime chile. . + There's just something about how the restaurant was so thoughtfully laid out that really wowed me. I dunno about other people, but most times that I eat at buffets, I feel like I'm back in high school or college, herded into a cafeteria for lunch with a hundred other bodies. Overall, I liked how they weren't stingy when it came to space--the buffet was sprawling, and spaced out in such a way that it wasn't so much of a sensory overload going from different station to station. Moreover, the tables were spaced out in a way that I could really enjoy my time dining with great company, rather than overhearing the next table over. It's just the little things, but for me, these small details speak volumes to the experience.. + Props to the man at the carving station who theatrically exclaimed "welcome to Bacchanal buffet!", as I gazed in awe at the sheer selection of meats to choose from. Details. Service here is friendly and pleasant, though it got a little spotty towards the end when the restaurant started getting busier. . . My best advice is to come early if you can. What's so bad about pulling an early bird special vs. waiting an hour plus in line? I anticipated a crazy wait, especially on a holiday weekend (Easter), but when we showed up at 11am for lunch, the time from the moment we arrived to the moment that we were seated was less than ten minutes! Not too shabby. As we left a few hours later though, the lines were excruciating. Positively excruciating. Prices were escalated due to the holiday. Around $60 pp and for only lunch nonetheless, which is a little crazy, but considering what you get it's not too bad. . . When in Vegas, few bills is a small price to go to buffet heaven. Trust me, this is the stuff that dreams are made of!
I've tried all the major buffets in Vegas except for the Wicked Spoon (next time?) and Bacchanal is by far way better than the rest.  Standouts include the Asian, breakfast and seafood.  This is the only Vegas buffet where I never get tired of trying something unusal.  Add smiling and happy to be there staff and wonderfully sunlit dining space, I could spend a day here and it feels so relaxing rather than rushed and hectic like the other buffets.  A truly worthwhile experience.
I don't normally pay $60 to eat at a buffet, but when I do, it's because I'm in Vegas.  . . After all, where else would you have to spend that that much on a buffet?  And while I'd typically prefer to spend that kind of money on a more "traditional" meal, things are a little different when you're in the City of Sin/Gluttony.  So, if I'm going to do some damage at a buffet, I might as well do it right!. . Like so many of the better (and pricier) buffets in Vegas, Bacchanal does a great job of combining both quality (for a buffet) and variety in their offerings.  Seriously, there's PLENTY to choose from - seafood (crab legs, raw oysters, mussels, shrimp, etc.), sushi, salad, pizza, pastas, made-to-order tacos, carvery station (lamb, prime rib, sausages, pork loin, etc.), Asian dishes, fruits, desserts (chocolate covered strawberries!), and more.  . . -- PLATE #1 - Prime Rib, Sausage, lamb, Onion Rings. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#mrb056oZjB9C2jzPM-2sYQ). The guy gave me a cut matching the wellness I wanted, but also with lot of tendons.  Still, the meat was tender and well-seasoned.  The lamb was great as well (perhaps a tad salty) and the sausage was fine, though nothing special.. . -- PLATE #2 - Raw Oysters, Fresh Snow Crab Legs, Salmon Sashimi, Tempura Roll. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#IK9Vz3U6qMf6W1-Yi22rNA). For the most part, Bacchanal's seafood is fresh.  The oysters were plump and meaty (though not as sweet as smaller varieties) and the crab was terrific (too bad no king crab...).  Also, while the tempura roll was rather "meh", the salmon sashimi was pretty good.. . -- PLATE #3 - Carne Asada Taco, Carnitas Taco, and Chips with Salsa and Guacamole. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#ITbZBYTJhTZ8GClrU4nLHg). I had hopes for the tacos since they were cooked to order, but they were just okay.  The taste was fine, but both the carne asada and carnitas were dry and tough.  Not surprising given how small the meat was cut though.. . -- PLATE #4 - Lobster Chowder and Kobe Beef Slider. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#J0kJKgJhIn2HdzgdVPaWOQ). The chowder was a little salty, but the consistency was spot on.  Impressive for a buffet, though I wish there was more lobster.  The sliders though were easily the worst thing I had.  Sitting under the warmers grossly overcooked the beef.. . To deal with the steady crowd that flows in every night, Bacchanal has a pretty good system set-up.  Instead of the usual snaking lines, they have kiosks where you can enter your name, party size, and cell phone number.  After the machine prints out your ticket, you're free to leave until they text you to let you know you're next.  Otherwise, you can pay an extra $15 per person for the "express" option.. . While the "express" option is nice, it's also a gamble.  The kiosk quoted a 45-55 minute wait for the two of us, which seemed high since it was quiet on a Thursday night at 8pm.  Still, we declined since we weren't that hungry anyways.  No more than about 5-10 minutes later though, we got a text telling us we were up.  Risky, to say the least.. . Although I can't say for myself, I've heard from friends that Wicked Spoon has fallen off a bit as of late.  Between that and how the vast majority of what we had was pretty solid (save for the sliders, but much better overall than Bellagio), Bacchanal just might be my new favorite buffet in Vegas.  Even if it might be by default.
this buffet was pretty good. it cost my husband and i about 150$ for dinner here and with that price tag and the huge wait i had extremely high expectations. (plus everyone raves about it) they do fresh piping hot plates of crab legs! amazeballz! their mushroom pallenta is to die for. alot of the food was pretty good. it was a decent buffet but i dont think it shouldve costed that much. i can see maybe 100$ for two ppl but damn 150$...honestly the wicked spoon's brunch/ lunch buffet at 27.99 a person was waaaaaaay more impressive than dinner here.
Amazing variety of great tasting food! You are guaranteed to leave satisfied. Service is great too!
Best Vegas buffet! They have all sorts of food from Asian, Italian, Spanish, and more!!! They have seafood and different kinds of meat! It is pricey but worth it if you have an appetite!
Great variety of dishes and love how many of them are already proportioned in individual servings so that they're not picked over or more importantly handled by gross possibly sick people.  I also love that they have a new check in and wait system.  Having a toddler it's important that we don't have to stand in like for over an hour, the new kiosk system where they text you when your table is almost ready is such a great concept.  The reason I couldn't give 5 stars is just that buffet food is never gonna be super hot or fresh cause it's made in big batches.
I picked this lunch buffet because of the decent rating from Yelp!  . . The price is $35.99 per person. . Overall, the choice of foods variety is somewhat limited with what other competitors offering.  Foods are so-so.  With this kind of price, I would go for Wicked Spoon at least they have good desserts.
Bacchanal is definitely worthy of the title: "Best Buffet On The Strip". I've tried all the top buffets on the strip(Wynn, Bellagio, The M) but Bacchanal tops them all in every category.. I notice the majority of low ratings come from the dinner reviews.. this review is based on breakfast and lunch.. . Food: I love the breakfast here.. they cover all the traditional breakfast food but with different flares. Things like Chicken&Waffles, Skirt Steak & Eggs, Corned Beef  Hash with a fried Quail Egg, & Lobster Egg Benedict. They also have a good amount of their lunch menu out during breakfast including the meat section, featuring about a dozen or so cuts/meat.. I especially enjoy the prime rib, habanero sausage, and bacon-wrapped lamb. The Asian food section in the back is also open in the morning.. foods like shumai, Pad Thai, sushi, and the Asian soup station(Pho, Ramen, Udon), which are actually pretty decent.. . This buffet has so much to offer.. from the 7 or 8 times we've visited, they've continued to come out with new, impressive options.. Some of my other highlights: Chilean seabass, broccoli casserole, fried fish, any of the dishes that are topped with a fried egg, Baklava gelato, the salted caramel brownie thing, and the Horchata! . . Ambiance: A very clean, modern look with a comfortable setting that gives you a relaxing experience when enjoying your food. The main seating area could be a bit of a maze when going back and fourth but the overall layout is great. The one thing that does bother me is how wide the party-of-2 tables are and how close the tables are to one another. I was literally right next to the lady at the table next to me and further away from my girlfriend sitting across from me. I felt like I had to talk extra loud for my girlfriend to hear me, but soft enough so the next table isn't involuntarily listening to me.. . Service: Yes, this is a very popular buffet but they've come up with the genius idea of having a kiosk system where they text you when your table is almost ready. It is a very attractive idea because you don't get that discouraging feeling of seeing that crazy long line. It also gives you the opportunity to go do other things while waiting(gamble) :). All the staff members are very welcoming and polite.. quick servers and helpful cooks. The price of this buffet is a little bit more than all the others, but you will definitely get your money's worth every time. . . Tips: If you're coming for breakfast, try to come at the end of the breakfast time(10-10:30ish) so you can get a taste of the lunch items that come out at 11am. Take your time, try to get in all the options they offer and enjoy. Don't forget your Total Rewards card for a small discount!
I have not had a Vegas buffet in ages but I was happy to see that Bacchanal had an electronic system to avoid unnecessarily long lines. You enter your phone number in the system and they text you when to come back instead of you standing there for hours starving to death. What a great idear!. . The seafood options were plentiful and super fresh. The fruit selection was disappointing as they really only had cantaloupe, honeydew, and pineapple. They had an amazing meatball but some of the dishes we tried were salty or overcooked. The dessert bar has tons of options but the lady scooping gelato was quite disgruntled.. . Highlight of the evening..... They take your picture before you enter the buffet them come around during your meal to see if you are interested in purchasing the picture. We had a group of four people at our table but when the guy came back he showed us a picture solo Asian guy. We did not want to purchase a picture but it was shocking as he had no clue or did not care.
I enjoyed it 1st time around when I found it to be pricey. 2nd time $65 Easter Sunday. It was more expensive. Nothing different from the 1st time. Lobster bisque was so salty. Quality of the majority of food deteriorated as well. There's so many other new places to try. Won't be going back.
Well well well....crab legs were my favorite, and they have cold or hot crab legs. We must have ate a ton of seafood at this buffet. Tried out lots of other food and i can say the service, food and atmosphere were just exeptional. Would go back again'
I'm usually not a big fan of buffets so to give 4 stars is saying a lot. . Although the line seems long, it goes pretty fast. I want for lunch on a Sunday and waited about 30 mins. Although the price on the higher end, the food quality is worth it. Lunch includes unlimited mimosas and champagne, juices, coffee and soft drinks. . . The food selection is pretty good. Everything was really fresh. I really loved their seafood section with the warm king crab legs, clam bake, and shrimp cocktail. To my disappointment, they only had oyster shooters and not fresh oysters even though they had oysters on display. . . The taco stand was pretty awesome with a wide variety of home made salsas. Make sure you try the mango habanero salsa. . . They were very generous with the unlimited champagne and mimosas. . . I heard they now have check in kiosks to minimize the lines and fresh oysters during dinner.
Best buffet in Vegas in my opinion ... The steak station is untouchable ... Try the sliders too and all the crazy desserts they offer ...
The price might be a little bit high($110 for 2 ppl), but the food is worth it. Love the oyster, eat 3 dishes of it. The Chinese food is good. And the cake is tasty. Oh, and I also love the ice tea in there
I'm here again found out they don't serve ribeye anymore major disappointment and the lamb chops not quite good also.  The oysters seem to take awhile to be brought out.  Hot crab legs over by the Italian side and the cocktail shrimp are still good.  The sliders are still awesome.  The desserts are good also.
One of the better buffets Vegas has to offer. Coming here on a Saturday, the price per person was $52 + tax. (-1 dollar if you have their players card). . . The wait time wasnt too bad. Since they changed it to the electronic "fast pass" system, our wait was about an hour. You can also input your cell number for text reminders. We decided to walk around the forum shops. . . We got through to pay fairly quick and were seated maybe, 5-10 minutes later. We were seated right next to the Dessert Station, right where the chocolate dipped strawberries were. *drools* . . First plate, meat station ! Both Doriee and I went for this first. Main reason we came here was because a friend came into town, and wanted lamb chops for dinner. Aside from our usual place to get lamb chops, we decided to try a new place. Since he hasnt been to the Bacchanal Buffet, here we went ! (despite my crying wallet Q_Q) Back to the story. When i arrived at the meat carving station, i asked for a slice of prime rib. then the lamb chops. here's how the conversation went between the carver and myself. . Me: Can i get some lamb chops?. Chef: How many? . Me: uhh 4?. Chef: 4? 5? 10?. Me: *joking* however many you want to give me ! ! !. . dot dot dot . . .. . *watches the chef use his tongs, and dig deep into the platter of lamb chops and grabbed all it can, and piled it on my plate.* For the record, he put SEVEN lamb chops on my plate. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED ! OM NOM NOM ! He did the same thing with Doriee but she stood firm on her request of 3, and would just pick off mine if she wanted more. . . To give an idea on the SIZE of these lamb chops. In comparison to like the the lamb chops from Koi (Australian? New Zealand?) or from Brio Tuscan Grille, these were at least 2-3x the size... EACH.. oh boy... what did i get myself into. They were heavy enough to make my arm tired from carrying it around to get more food ! x_x I could easily say, they were an easy 1-2lb of MEAT. yeah i ate it all. Meat temp wise, was a hit and miss. throughout everyone at the table, we got about a 50% chance of getting a perfect med rare cook. other 50% was medium or higher. Flavor was good. Overall great lamb chops !. . Prime rib was a bit dry. Kind of sad. . . Crab was hot (station now at italian area). Butter still by the seafood station though. . Cocktail shrimps were huge. Enough to make me take 2 bites instead of the usual 1 bite chomp-age. . Oyster was fat and fresh. Not completely clean but not bad. I think i had a baby pearl in mine too XD . . Chicken Ginseng Soup is NOT in individual clay bowls anymore. I guess thats a good thing, so it prevents me from burning my fingers over and over trying to get it... Lol. Flavor was pretty good. I do believe they added salt to the soup though (we never do at home). No sight of ginseng anymore (sad ! i like eating ginseng too) . . DESSERTS !. . yeah by the time i reached this stage, i was pretty stuffed over limit already. Previously noted chocolate strawberries were all gone for the night. Limited to 1 per person. . . Souffles ! my fav ! fresh made to order ! piping hot out of the oven !. . pistachio - Light ! flavorful ! little sweet ! great with a cup of coffee ! . chocolate - super rich x_x chocolate-y ! DEFINITELY needed the coffee otherwise i'd have trouble finishing this. . churros - short pieces of churro, freshly made. nice and hot. filled in the middle with a pastry cream. . . Overall experience. Great ! Service was a bit slow on picking up used/empty plates. Friend was happy with his experience (he's quite picky).. . I ate to the point where i didnt have much room in me to breathe ! doriee can attest to seeing my difficulty in breathing.. short quick breathes only x_x
this was a perfect pit stop for our bachelorette party as us girls were super craving a huge dessert bar. we also had a good selection of their seafood, surprisingly good dim sum, and lamb. don't forget to try the corn on the cob... so much butter.. a definite must for splurging :) i love this buffet's dessert bar... unlimited creme brulee, macarons, and chocolate covered strawberries. heavenly!
I'm not a big fan of buffets usually, but I do have to say that this buffet was good.  I thought it was a bit over priced. We went for breakfast, the buffet isn't that large but service was good.
3.5 Stars. . Good selection of seafood and desserts, expensive.. . Thought we'd try this place out for dinner with a group of 7, it was $65/person?  In order to be seated your entire party must be present.  . The decor is nice and trendy and the food selection is pretty good, but really, only 2 hours to stuff myself?!. I really liked the seafood and dessert sections, everything else was aright.  They even had ramen/pho but I'd rather go to a place that focuses just on those soups.  I was hooked on the horchata and aguas frescas though.. . I prefer Caesars buffet still.
Sunday champange brunch!  I suppose everything is better with booz but we had a great time.  Great selection of food and everyting looked quality.  Negatives are that they don't have a non-champagne option for non-drinkers (so I had to drink twice as much of couse) and their crab was icy.  I had them boil it but it was so salty, it was ineddible. But it was no biggy cuz they kept the mimosas coming!
Amazing amazing amazing!!!! Best meal so far in Vegas! We came for lunch. The American and Mexican station were my favorite with dessert close behind. The pork sliders were incredible!! Really blown away and totally worth the 77$ for both my husband and I! Yum yum yum
Wow... This is really the best buffet on the strip. The top 3 buffets are: . 1. Caesars palace buffet . 2. Wicked Spoon buffet at Cosmopolitan. 3. Bellagio buffet. . Dessert options are amazing!!. Love the juice bar juices!!. The variety of food is great!! . Beautiful, modern buffet!!
