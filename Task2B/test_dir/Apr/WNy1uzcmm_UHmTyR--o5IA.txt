Amazing food, atmosphere, and service! This is our 3rd time coming here and it is great as usual!
good food, good drinks service was okay
Been here a couple times.  Love their food!  I have had a few of their Pasty's, loved each one.  Very friendly staff also.  I always reccomend to friends and coworkers.
This has been a favorite place of mine for a long time.. There are so many great options on the menu, so it'll take some time to try everything and very hard to pick a favorite. . The staff is nothing short of fun and make dining in a great experience.
Great cider, thats about it...just left after sitting there and being ignored. 1st we get told the apetizer will take the same amount of time as the main dish. Then we spilled a drink, had to wait 2 passes of our waitress to get her attention. When we finally did, she said she would be right back with a towel. 15 minutes later, she has taken 3 more orders in front of us and no towel. We ask to cancel our order and get tje check, only to be told your meal is ready. We refused the meal and paid for our drinks and left a 0 tip. Great to be ignored and left with a soggy table.
Great food, nice wait staff, and an awesome experience overall. Try the Chicken Tikka Marsala.  I'm not from Arizona so I went out in a limb trying this place but I'm glad I did.. . Also the ambience won't be for everyone. It's kind of dark inside and the music is a mix of punk rock and some alternative jams.
Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite places to eat! The food is always delicious and the beer selection is amazing.
The oggie is so good & my sister tried the pilgrim which she said made her mouth soooo happy!
Dined at Central Bistro, it was wonderful.  We had the Drunk Bread for an appetizer, it was absolutely delicious.  I had the seared Salmon  with artichokes, haricot vert (string beans), purple potatoes in a lobster sauce.  It was absolutely delicious.  Friends had  the peanut thai salad & pasta with clams.  Everyone enjoyed their dinner.  It was a little on the pricey side for me, but well worth the food.  I would eat there again in a hearbeat~
Love this place. The pasty's are great but I love the Scottish eggs.
Too loud and dark inside and waaay too smokey outside, if that is your scene, then you would probably enjoy the Cornish Pasty co. Service was also really slow and my food was super salty and luke warm when it did finally come, blech!
We had the chicken pot pie pastie and the traditional (beef, potato, rutebega, cabbage) pastie. Kids and adults ate and enjoyed. The pasties are delicious and huge. I would have liked the filling to be a little more saucy. I know the wine sauces served on the side are meant for dipping and that would have been nice if we like wine sauces but no one in our family does. Tastes like your Cornish grandma is in the kitchen lovingly making pasties for all to enjoy. I'd come back.
Wow!  Here to visit family, but my wife and I snuck off and enjoyed a little piece of heaven tonight.  We loved the meatballs as an appetizer, then had the Cajun Chicken Pasty, both of which were divine.  We even split the Chocolate Bread Pudding for dessert.  We are still able to move, barely, and both more than happy with our meal.  Terrific time, we really enjoyed ourselves.
Food was pretty good, and it is definitely authentic British food. We also liked the feel of the place. Our waiter service was very good as well!. . I think that this type of food is just not my thing though. It was a bit heavy, and I had a stomach ache that evening. It also seems to be a bit dirty (the place is dark, so it's difficult to see!).
Always worth it. Everything is delicious, especially the peppered steak pasty. Get the oven chips with garlic. They also have great happy hour deals -- $3 Strongbow and $3 Irish car bombs.
Delicious beer, even delicious-er pasties. If I could live here, I would. . . There's maybe nothing I would improve upon except slightly faster service. But even then, I've never gone here while I was in a rush so that's never been a major issue. . . The Pilgrim is my favorite, but my friend recently ordered the beef abodobe or something like that and it looked so good I thought about murdering him so I could take it. Ultimately I decided I was too full to eat it, but that guy knows to watch his back now.
Great service with reasonable rates.  Try any and everything, even my wife likes it here.
The amazing reviews drove us to try this place.  It was not as close to the ASU as we thought it was, but it's a pretty cool place with decent food.  A patsy is an English version of a calzone with a huge variety of fillings.  We had a Royal with cheese (cheeseburger), lamb with mint, bangers n mash and eggplant Parmesan.  All were quite good but nothing spectacular.  The Greek salad was delicious, as were the oven chips (French fries) with garlic.  Great selection of brews and a very cool atmosphere.
I cannot even explain how much I loved this place. Between the food and beer list I couldn't be happier. Had the chicken pot pie and died over it. Definitely not the most comfy seating arrangements but over all really great experience!
I have to say this place was pretty good! It was the first time I've tried this kind of food. The dishes were a good portion. The waitress was nice and the environment was relaxing. . . The only thing I'd have to say is to make sure to sit inside the restaurant. We had people smoking heavily who sat at the booth next to us and the waitress didn't do anything about it because they were her friends.
Sat on the patio..awesome beers..awesome food (can't beat having your whole meal served in a hot pocket).  Garlic Frys are really good. . Music even better.   Must hit this place up again.
This is a must when in Phoenix! I loved it all, the service, the environment and of course the food! We had a Greek salad (crisp, fresh and healthy) the peppered steak pasty (delicious, big enough to share) and the peanut butter and jelly dessert pasty (to die for) Highly recommended
"Cozy" pub atmosphere, great food, easy on the wallet.  I had the bangers and mash pasty, she had the cottage pie pasty, we were both in heaven. Took a dessert home to share. Server was helpful and very nice. My only minor issue was that we came out smelling like we worked in the kitchen--lots of ambient cooking aromas.
Gross!
This place is awesome!! This was my first time visiting and I will be going back. I had the Rosemary Chicken and my Honey had The Italian. Delish!!
Really great food all the times I've been. Servers are never super outgoing and friendly but who cares, they are busy doing a million things and it's pretty much always busy. Don't get me wrong, the service is always good, and my beer never stays empty for more than a minute or two, if that.  It's got real character, a dark little hole in the wall place. Most of the time I sit at the bar, and the cooks make up for what the servers may lack in conversation or banter. I like that the cooks have a tip box too, that way I can hook it up if the food or cooks go above and beyond which is most every time. I'm scared to go to the other Cornish pasty because I'm afraid it won't compare... It looks a little too clean and contemporary and in my experience the original is always the best. Not a ton of people know about it, so it's great to take first timers there. The menu is vast, unique, and offers plenty for every taste. Every time I've taken a newbie there they have always, always, always been a big fan. Keep it up fellas, your doing great.
Soooo tasty! I am sold on the cajun pasty! Service was ok, I think the pasties take a really long time to bake, but they are worth the wait.  Wish I lived closer to it!
Been here too many times. The food is always amazing. Last year I made an attempt to try very pasty on the menu and I DID. Pasty do take about 15 mins to bake, so please be patient and the beer is always pouring. Simple food. Amazing food.
