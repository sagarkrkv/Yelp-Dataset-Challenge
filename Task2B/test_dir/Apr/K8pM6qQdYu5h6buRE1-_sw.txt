small Lil place very good chicken they have an abundance of sides as well kool-aid to drink lol I guess that's good for kids. Waffles are good I like syrup on the chicken and the waffles but honey is good too on chicken
I wish this place was closer to where I live. But I suppose it's a good thing it's not or I'd be there too much.. . I'd been wanting to try Lolo's since I heard about them. A place specializing in chicken and waffles? I'm there! But it was too far away to make just popping on down practical. . . Then one day I was actually in the neighborhood and got a chance to go. The interior of the place is unique, with lots of interesting things to look at. There are several flatscreen TVs and the menus were fun. . . The sheer amount of food you get is amazing. The chicken was almost exactly what my mom used to make when I was a kid. I wanted to have dessert afterward but filled up on the happiness that was the two-leg and a waffle combo. I had the blue drank, a mason jar of blue Koolaid that was endless. I didn't actually need a refill though. One jar was enough for me. . . Our waitress was friendly and genuine. There was complimentary valet parking though we found a spot on the street easy enough. The overall atmosphere there was laid back and relaxing. I had a good time and great food. As I said before, I'd go there more often if it were only closer. If you've been thinking about trying this place, get off the fence and into the restaurant.
It was our first time here and everything was going smooth. We came in about 5:30pm and it was getting busy. We waited to be seated and I thought it was pretty cool they had a couch you can chill on while you wait. . . When we were seated, our server greeted us in a timely manner. We asked for some help since it was our first time and he did a fine job letting us know what was popular and pointed us to certain things I asked about. I asked him to go ahead and get our drinks while we decide what we wanted to get.. . He came back and asked if we were ready and we said that we were. We placed our order (Number 3, which is 3 pc chicken with two waffles, and a chicken strip basket with fries and a side of corn bread) and then he asked "So what did you guys want to drink, again?" Wait a minute. I thought we had already given him our drink order and instead of coming with them, he came and asked what we wanted. That was a tad annoying. . . Our order was brought out by a lady who didn't really acknowledge us. Basically "who had this or that" and placed them in the center of the table anyway. She just left without saying a word or asking if we would like anything else. Right away, we noticed we had gotten everything except for our corn bread. We waited for our waiter to make his rounds but he didn't come back. It took awhile but he came to seat someone else so the couple seated at the table next to us got his attention and said that they were missing a few items from their order. So we weren't the only ones. . . After a few trips back and forth to them because he kept forgetting things they were asking for, I got his attention and said that we were missing corn bread. He said he would bring them out. I saw him a few times after that helping other customers and that's fine but he came back to our table and asked how we were doing...without our corn bread. I had to remind him again that we needed corn bread. We were almost done with our meal by this time.. . After he finally brought it to us, he started coming around a little more. At that point, I wasn't sure whether or not if it had slowed down or not. I figured it did since he was coming around some more. It was kind of too late, anyway.. . When it came time to bring us our bill, he had to ask us what we had ordered today. I was surprised... He said they had misplaced our order. How does that even happen? I've never heard of such a thing...EVER. I should have just told him that service was lousy and since they had lost our order stub, I didn't have to pay for the food. But since I did eat it (cause I was hungry mind you) and possibly a little too understanding, I gave him my entire order again.. . So we paid and started leaving and I saw that it was as packed as ever. Worse than when we had arrived. I didn't understand why he would have time to keep checking on us at the end of the meal as opposed to during the meal. Now, I do understand that he may have been new or may even have been too slammed but shouldn't waiters and any establishment at the very least come by and ask if you were doing okay? IDK but the service wasn't on par with some other little restaurants I've been to. . . As for the food, to me it really wasn't anything special. The chicken wasn't like how they make it out to be and the waffles were still kind of dough-y. I may have gone at a bad time but it's a restaurant and they should be consistent. The chicken strips weren't too bad and the best part of the meal was the fries. I gave one-star for the food and one-star for the service. . . I guess I was expecting a lot more from the reviews and reputation Lo Lo's had...
CAUTION!!!!!!! Take a picture of your signed receipts here! Waiters/Waitresses like to over charge your card with a larger tip.... I know this because it happened to me unfortunately. Management was very unapologetic and made it seem like it was my fault that I didn't give the waitress a 30% tip...hmmm. I am still waiting for the management to return the excess money to my card. I guess that's what happens when little restaurants flourish. They get MONEY HUNGRY!! I doubt my little yelp review will damage the business in any way, but I feel like I would be doing a disservice not to warn my fellow consumer. Word to the wise...check your bank statements after visiting here...you might end up with an extra expense for GREED!
Been here a few time the food and customer service are always consistent. Had Chris as a server recently took good care of us. But I Dislike there new valet service. If you choose not to use it you have to park on the street. Guess they don't want you imposing on their tips
Great place and seems to be newly renovated.  It's very clean.  Chicken is crunchy and moist, corn bread is tasty, although waffles could be better (too soft and for me).  Drinks are sweet as they should be.  This place has a real southern feel to it and service is friendly.  They also have a live DJ.
Chicken and waffles not much more to say. Fries chicken was great, then only to mix in the sweetness of waffles?! Wish I had somewhere like this in my hometown.
If this place was closer is come once a week. The servers are great. The food is always good. I also think this one is better than the one in Scottsdale
This was my second time here and it was the same as the last time which I appreciate. We were met at the door with a friendly smile and seatedquickly. The place was packed with people which was nice. . . I ordered the original 3 pieces of fried chicken with two waffles aka the lo lo. The chicken was very good with great flavor and cooked perfectly. The waffles were the same as the last time. Good but not great. I would expect more from the waffles due to the fact that the word is in the name of the restaurant but overall they are fine. The kool aid was great with zero complaints about it. . . Overall this place is very good and worth the time it takes to drive down to south Phoenix.  I will certainly come back if I'm in the area.
I just ate here on Wednesday night, and like always the food was amaz! Everyone there is so friendly and nice. Our Waitress was on top of everything and really sweet. I always enjoy this yummy comfort food!
This is by far some of the best food I've eaten, customer service is great.. Only down falls the wait time to be seated and served as well very small parking lot. If you have  the patience, and don't  mind walking a few blocks this is the place to go.. "not crazy about the chairs"
Happened to be bicycling by the larger digs yesterday at 6PM and  there was no line. There also is no entrance from the parking lot - people have to walk around to the street to get in the place. I would love them if the perfection stopped right there as long as the food wasn't poisonous.. . But then, wonderfully funky interior design in an old commercial space, top notch staff, perfectly fried drumsticks, wonderfully textured fresh waffles, excellent okra and greens, really good lemonade and thou beside me looking at Carlos Rivas' rooster. Bicycling home at sunset. . . What more can be asked of life?
Amazing food, fun atmosphere!  We went on a Saturday night so there was a DJ playing music too. Because they are so popular be prepared to wait to be seated and for your food but just chill cause it's worth the wait. :-)
