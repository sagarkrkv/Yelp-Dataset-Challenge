I wish I could give it 0 stars. This place is horrible to locals I will never return. I have never been so upset at a hotel in my life I will never spend a dime here again. Rude rude rude. Skip this trash hole. With bad customer service
An otherwise enjoyable trip to Las Vegas to celebrate my 50th birthday with my son was spoiled by the very poor customer service at Red Rock Casino Resort. The staff put my climbing guide's climbing ropes on pavement freshly treated with "acetone-based" pavement sealer (hotel staff's admission; not my words); ropes are now unusable for climbing. The manager was worse than belligerent and unhelpful. I paid for 5 nights, plus a couple of very expensive dinners at the hotel, but left  feeling completely taken for granted. If you're a rock climber, then this place is in a good location, but I can't see myself ever going back. #redrocks #rockclimbing.
Wow; other reviews seem to say opposite, but my family was treated like royalty and we weren't even staying there. Great food, friendly, fast courteous service and simply a great time for Sunday breakfast at their Grand Cafe for a reasonable price.
Literally walking distance from my door I'm still of mixed feelings about Red Rock.  Sure it has a convenient theater and bowling, but both are overpriced compared to other 'locals' casinos.  Sure it has some unique restaurants, but they are in a constant state of chef turnover and flux.  Add in the fact that there is no shopping to speak of until the Shops at Summerlin open and I see this as a nice "upscale" locals spot, but not something one should go out of their way of for anything other than gambling and perhaps the occasional night of entertainment.  Credit is due to the "no smoking" games, but they really aren't so far off from the standard games and options are limited.
A wonderful resort outside of Vegas. Makes you feel like you are by a beach somewhere. We held a convention there and service was impeccable. Whatever we wanted, we received. The rooms are gorgeous and the resort is beautiful. They have an outstanding pool. The service by the pool or in the pool bar is not the speediest. If you order a drink or food, expect to wait awhile. Since tip is already included, they do not respect the time is money aspect. We probably waited 10-15 minutes each time for a drink, let alone the time it took to get a meal. The setting is awesome, so in a way, it makes up for it.. The casino is very clean and the restaurants are outstanding. A 20 min. ride from the strip, this Casino makes you think you are far away from Vegas, but since it's a short ride to the Strip, your Vegas experience awaits!
Great casino, lots and lots of fabulous restaurants, bowling alley, theaters, very easy to park, they have the best salad bar in their buffet.  Their is so much to do there, enjoy sitting out in there eating areas, also happy hour is excellent. in there yard house.
I'd like to compliment the entire staff at Red Rock. Every bit of our stay here was great! Valet was courteous and very fast. Our room was beautiful! When I made the reservation over the phone he recommended the canyon view which was a great choice! We even had a view of the beautiful pool which we enjoyed very much. When we had to check out they even held our bags for is so we could use the pool a bit longer and even let us use the spa amenities to freaked up and change when we were done. We both forward to visiting Red Rock again!!!
Very accommodating! They meet the mark on all aspects of comfort & customer service. Cozy beds, jetted bath tubs, walk in showers. A wonderful Spa and amazing pool lounge area. All staff are very professional & meet guest needs.
This is my second time staying here. The rooms are always clean and the staff is always friendly. The hotel is great for kids and families. They have a movie, bowling alley, arcade and kid friendly pools. The only negative about the hotel is the $24.95 resort fee. It includes internet service that is really slow, my phone has faster wifi.
I loved staying at Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa! . . The rooms are really nice, and the prices are affordable compared to staying on the strip. . . Good selection of shops and restaurants. . . The bowling alley is a lot of fun, with pool tables, other games, and a bar. . . The spa is expensive, but it's really nice. I enjoyed hanging out in the jacuzzi after my massage. . . Also, there's great hiking nearby at Red Rock Canyon.. . I highly recommend this hotel.
Room is great,  but service is so bad, they didn't clean the room since two days and I have to stay till this Monday in the hotel cuz recipients told me they don't refund the money if I leave b4 Monday,  we have a problem using the shower n their engineer just came to fix it plus the phone isn't connected!!! ..... Not recommended at all.
Off the strip casino, but worth going to.  Rooms are nice and they have some pretty good restaurants as well as bars/club.
