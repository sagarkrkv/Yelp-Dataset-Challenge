I didn't even realize it was possible for brisket to be this tender. I got the famous smoked meat sandwich with fat, and it was the best meat sandwich I've ever had. The texture of the meat was so soft and rich that I had no idea how the employees were able to slice it without it completely falling apart. The price is very reasonable, and the overall look of the place, pricing, and menu seems to reflect the place sticking to its roots and continuing to do what it does best, while remaining accessible to anyone.
Vous recherchez un resto a la reputation surfaite, ou l'on attend en ligne dehors pour entrer, meme a moins 10 degres ? Vous revez de manger un smoked meat tres ordinaire, a la viande un peu seche ? Vous souhaitez prendre place dans un endroit un peu ringard pour ne pas dire un peu crasseux ? Alors, faites partie de la legende en vous rendant chez Schwartz's. Un endroit mythique a Montreal dont je ne comprends pas encore ce qui a fait sa reputation et fait courir autant les foules. Desole aupres des inconditionnels, de Celine et de Rene, mais j'ai connu mieux en smoked meat.
I'm from Los Angeles where we have our share of world-class Jewish delis: Brent's and Canter's can rival just about anyone. Meanwhile, we don't have the around the corner, long lines that Schwartz's has, possibly because the above locations are much larger. Even with the massive hype Schwartz's gets via TV, social media, etc, it's not overblown. The smoked meat (or corned beef as many of us call it) it that good. It belongs amongst the best in North America, almost as good as Katz in NYC and at par with Harold's in Jersey, Caplansky's in Toronto and way better than Dunn's. . . Coming to Schwartz's isn't normally a quick stop. There always seems to be a crowd here. Patience is a must and if you are big into delis it's worth the wait, even though sometimes it's well over an hour. Think of it as an adventure and enjoy it. You'll be telling your friends and family about this experience at some point. And, unless you have a party of four don't expect your own table. They'll slap you at the same table with two others and there's nothing you can do about it. . . Keep in mind, this place doesn't have a dynamic menu. They focus on what they do well, smoked meat. And, if you come expecting that you'll be wowed during each bite. The tender, lean, juicy meat is unforgetabble.
This place rocks. Smoked meat sandwich is incredibly good. Wow good to be honest.  I'd skip the fries next time though.  They were a bit soggy.  Don't let the line scare you. This is a must while in Montreal.
I don't get the people who underrate Schwartz any lower than 5 stars. The place is supposed to be everything that you're experiencing there:. . -the sitting area is bustling, smells of food and loud. -service isn't the same as in any other restaurant. expect a little "attitude", but in a good way. -the guys behind the counter are great. -they get so many tourists so it makes sense that they may be expedient, especially at the cash register.. . Places like Schwartz keep Montreal special and unique. Katz deli in NYC is twice the price and 2/3 of the taste.
Il s'agit d'une enseigne existante depuis 1928. Un vrai et bon deli. Un service impeccable. Une viande tres savoureuse. Nous l'avons choisie maigre ce qui rend le sandwich plus digeste. Les frites maisons sont appreciables, ainsi que la salade de choux pour la note dietetique!
Was at this place over the long Easter wknd 2014.  Place was already packed at 10am on a Sunday. Didn't get a chance to check in... and new back in TO and it will not allow me to.  Lol. . Walked in and asked for a hot corn beef sandwich to go... it was ready in 2 minutes.   The sandwich was delicious.  But they not get a chance to sit in or order anything else.   No pickles or fries :(. . Sandwich was a bit small but very good.   . . Cost of sandwich was $8.90.  Well definitely order 2 next time... lol. . After the sandwich, went next door to pick up 2 packs of meat to go.  Have not tried it yet... but don't think it will taste as good as eating there.
Went on the holiday weekend and the lineup  was going down the street.  We opted for take out instead of waiting for a seat.  They had all the fixings we needed to make our own sandwiches so we went that route.  We'll be back!
If you like meat, then come here!!! You get so much meat in one sandwich that the meat is falling out left and right every bite you make!. . Also the staff there are super nice!! . . Great place, especially for the price!
Good smoked meat. Better seasoning than the others I tried while in MTL but a little fatty for my tastes. For those who don't mind a little fat this will likely be a five for you. . . Went during the day on a Sunday on our way back to Toronto and the take out was not too busy which was a pleasant surprise based on reviews. . . The fact that this place is cheaper than T.O spots like Caplansky's makes no sense but I'll take it. . . Definitely worth a try
So so so yummy! I want to stand up and clap hands for the famous long-history smoked beef sandwich!! The meat is tender and soft
One of those rare occasions in life where something so highly rated not only lives up to the reputation but actually exceeds it.. . I'm serious about my my stacked sandweeches, and this place is the benchmark. For such a crazy busy place, the staff is actually super friendly and helpful. Go here now.
Ummm... I assume majority of these yelpers have never been to Katz deli in NYC. That place is set up very similar but 6 times as big with longer lines... Maybe the yelpers hyped it up. I was very disappointed. My boyfriend wanted to order 2 sandwiches and we're glad we ordered only 1 after taken the first bite. The meat was DRY even though it was fatty. The meat didn't melt in your mouth like others described. I thought the $7.95 was cheap for a "famous" sandwich of Montreal. Yes, the cherry coke, fries and 1/2 sour pickle does go well but the sandwich itself failed!!!. . If you like this place, please try Katz. It's about $17 for a sandwich but it's well worth it. The taste and texture is so much better!
