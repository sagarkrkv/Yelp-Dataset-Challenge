My hotel room was being flipped by a man when I returned to my room.  I actually caught the man in my room going through all my belonging.  It turns out it was the maid that let him in the room.  Then the Flamingo (every manager I have spoken to and there have been several) argues that they are not to blame and will compensate me for my room charges.  I even had to insist for a room upgrade after they moved me to another room after the incident (as they call it).  They were not sympathetic at all that my belongings were all gone through and that it was their maid that let him into my room.  Now if something would have been stolen then they say it would have been a different story.  Thank god I caught him in the act.  I WARN EVERYONE, NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!
This has been the worst experience EVER!  The hotel was dirty with a roach crawling across our room.  Mold in the bath room.  To add insult to injury, they have charged us for 3 nights even though we only stayed 2. They acknowledge we were there for 2 and that we paid for 2 but the reservation was through Priceline and the dates were wrong so they were billing us an extra day - totally frustrating!  Don't bother.  The lack of Customer Service is appalling!  This experience has been the worst hotel stay I've ever had.
HOORAY!!!  I won five cents on the penny slots here!  I know, total high roller :P. . $1 kept me entertained for five minutes and I ended up winning a nickel.  Woo Hoo!!. . Thank you, thank you very much Flamingo.
Alright, this was my first time in Vegas and in a Vegas hotel, so maybe they are all like this, but based on walking through the MGM, I doubt it.  Firstly, the adjoining rooms that we were supposed to have were suddenly not available, and there weren't even any rooms we could book next to each other, although the hotel looked less than crowded.  The closest we could get was in the same hallway.  Then when we got to the elevators... it looked so rundown I didn't want to go into it!  I have a fear of badly maintained elevators, and this one was scratched and old looking.  Our floor's carpet was in no better shape: dirty, and crinkled.  I wouldn't let people into my house with the way that looked.  I felt disgusted that I was paying for that.. The room itself was okay, except the fact that the blanket couldn't keep someone warm if they were standing with it on in 90 degree weather.  I almost wanted to put my jacket over me when sleeping, and I'm someone that can usually tolerate the cold.  Then there's the WiFi you pay for, when it's free in Motel 6 or most shady motels, for that matter.  Ridiculous.. And the customer service... here we go.  I have (except once or twice) never been so rudely treated in my entire life.  I got lost one night, because my sense of direction sucks in new places, and they tried to kick me out of the hotel lobby because I wasn't gambling but looking to meet up with my people.  When I FINALLY convinced them that I stayed there, they demanded to see my room card and wanted to know what room I was in.  I couldn't remember that either, just that we were three down from the end of the hall on the left.  (I still can't remember the number.  I suck with numbers).  They continued to harass me until my friends showed up, at which time they told them that I had been acting drunk and they were kicking me off the floor.  How drunk could I have been "acting" when half the places around smell like vomit, and I can safely say I was nowhere near that point?  When my boyfriend asked what I did, they said that they couldn't say, just that I was drunk.  He then said, "Does she look drunk?" To which they had to say no.  Then the manager came over and said that we all had to leave and that none of us could gamble anymore.  She said it was a "managerial decision.". So, if you aren't going to give them money every second, be prepared to be kicked out, even if you're staying there.. This place made the worst California hotels look like resorts.
This was my first time staying at The Flamingo and I loved it. We had a clean room with a decent view of the strip and at a reasonable price. Most comfortable bed ever at a hotel. Easy access to The Linq and Strip. Having read other reviews, I was worried about elevators or our key cards...but had no problems with either. Plenty of options for late night drunk munchies...my faves were Johnny Rockets and pizza at the cafe right outside the garden area. I will definitely be staying  here again.
Customer service was deplorable!  My reservations were made several weeks in advance and they knew exactly what time I would be arriving.  Upon arriving I was told my booking had been oversold and they needed to find another type of room.  Room #1:  went up to the 28th floor only to find our keys didn't work.  Called front desk & waited for security.  He was (finally) able to access the room only to find it had not been cleaned at all.  Back to the front desk.  Room #2:  back up to the 28th floor.  Again cards did not work.  Security opened the door, but thankfully the guests had the deadbolt on or we would've walked in on them.  Back to the front desk.  Room #3:  Back up to the 28th floor.  Keys worked.  Room was NOT nice, and the keys continued to not work several times over the next two days.  The front desk staff did NOT ONCE even offer an apology.  . . There are too many choices in Las Vegas to have this be one of them.
I have two stays at Flamingo, because I am not good at learning my lessons the first time around. My first problem is I used to fall for all those comp offers Harrah's sends at you. Honestly, when you realize flights are on sale and you can get your hotel stay for FREE, who says no? . . Well, this guy is now in the business of saying "no" to all Harrah's offers. Free is good, but comfort and time are more important. Harrah's properties steal both. My first complaint with Flamingo is it is tragically dated. Like, it's sad. We recently did a week-long stay where we split it between Flamingo and Paris. My first words once we got to our room in Paris were, "We're never staying at Flamingo again.". . Everything about the place is ancient, with no hope in sight. The rooms are comical. Almost as bad as Bally's. So, you would think well at least you could get a room with a view, right? Well, no matter how many hundreds of dollars we (and by "we" I mean my wife) donated to the casino floor, we still were never afforded a strip-front room. And that's crap, because I know it's an option. . . Two stars because I've always found the staff to be very friendly and the buffet is a good option on an off-night with a coupon.
This was my third and last time staying at the Flamingo. Stayed here for my friends Bachelorette party and everything about our stay was HORRID! . . My friend called the hotel to book a Suite for 8 people. When we checked in the gave us two connected rooms when my friend specifically said she wanted one big suite. Our two rooms were a Fab Room and a "mini suite" we had one updated room and the other was disgusting and old! The couch was for DISGUSITINGGGGG. With white mystery stains and all. . . We were all pissed and dissatisfied with this room since we spent more than a pretty penny on the room. They did nothing for us. The supervisors Josh and Ramon were the most unhelpful human beings I've beer talked to in my life. When we told them we had 8 people in the room they said "that room does not hold eight people. We charge $30 extra a night per person" WTH!!! We called and asked for a room for 8 people and you want to charge us extra for YOUR MISTAKE??? . . Also none of the ice machines worked on our floor, the floor below us and the floor above us. The front desk wanted to charge us EIGHT DOLLARS FOR ICE. . . All they care about is getting as much money as possible. I hate you Flamingo. I used to love you but now I'm a sad angry customer.
I was here in October 2013. One of my best friends and I stayed in a double bed suite over looking Caesars Palace. Not anything fancy but we decided to go with Flamingo because of the location and the awesome tropical habitat. It would be our first time In Vegas and we stayed for 10 days. (way to long lol) . . I found this hotel to be  very smokey compared to other hotels on the strip we visited. I can't remember the wing we stayed on but we had to walk right through the casino by the flamingo habitat, pizza place, etc to get to the elevators and I choked up every time. And I SMOKE!!! lol . . Price wise it was pretty good. About 115usd in resort fees and 15 bucks a day or something like that for wifi and you can only connect one device? but for the amount of time we actually stayed at the hotel, what evs. . . The location is great. Pretty central. Close to everything and the train thingy stops right there. Really close to the Hash House a Go-Go. You really have to Go-Go there. mmmm... Lots of shops in the hotel itself and soon to be more and more rooms as they were in the middle of construction when we were there. Check in wasn't too long and the staff was friendly enough. There was an older guy there that really stood out. I wish I would have gotten his name because I would have dropped it right here ______ is an awesome employee!! Give him a raise!! lol. . I would recommend the Flamingo if you are like we were and almost never in the hotel anyway. When you're running on 3 hours of sleep a night just because you're up sightseeing all night a little smoke really isn't going to kill ya.. . (MGM was the best smelling! LOL)
I have always liked the Flamingo. Never got to actually stay there but a few years ago, my cousin did so zip got to check out the pool, spa, slot machines and the actual Flamingos. I loved the atmosphere actually but there are better places you can stay. The grounds itself were on point, cocktail waitresses serving the drinks while gambling were on point. It really is just a very old property in Las Vegas.
We checked in at 8:30 pm Friday night. Drive all the way from LA on our way too Reno, and just wanted to take a hot shower, kids and all. They did not tell us at check in there was no hot water. Got up to the room and got naked ready for a shower, NO HOT WATER. Called the front desk got put on hold for 25 minutes but talked to two people that picked up but were not managers. Tracy at the front desk stated that they thought it had been fixed and she was sorry and that some of the towers have BEEN having issues. Finally after 25 minutes Ricardo the manager got on the phone and of course I was pissed asked what they are doing to compensate, he said he could refund the resort fee of $20.16 and that was all. He was VERY UNHELPFUL AND RUDE. HE STARTED THAT IT WOULD BE FIXED IN AT LEAST AN HOUR AND IT IS 11:20 pm now. I asked if we could at least switch rooms and he said they had no rooms left. I went online right after and they had plenty of rooms. I also asked why they did not inform me at check in and he said that they did not know about the issues, WHICH WAS A LIE. Tracy at the front desk told me they were having issues already and knew know about it. NOT HAVING ANYMORE ROOMS WAS ALSO A LIE. The manager Ricardo treated me like I was was hustling for a free room, but I think if you pay for a hotel room the least you can get is hot water. The total lack of customer service by  manager to do anything about it was unbelievable. If they would have told me from the get go about the hot water I would have gone to Harrahs next door. So they choose to lie to us to get our money. I just called again and talked to manager Josh who was very nice and said he could move us to another room,(but Ricardo said there were no rooms)that again proved he was lieing. My daughter is sleeping so we can't change rooms now but would have loved to 4 hours ago when we first checked in. JOSH the competent manager also have us a thirty dollar credit for breakfast or drinks, why was Ricardo such an idiot and why is he a manager if he was not willing to do anything? I will never come back here. I work in the gaming industry and know they would comp a room in a second for a gamer or VIP but Ricardo would do nothing for a regular customer with a child. I am so disgusted with his customer service he should be fired. At least Josh was willing to do something but 4 hours too late. I guess it matters who you talk to. I had to give it one star just because Josh was nice and actually was willing to move us tho a new room.
Meh - I was forced to stay here while in town for a convention by my "cost conscious" boss. It appears it is about to be renovated since the parent company now owns like all 6 casinos in a row next to it, hopefully that will help. The buffet food was not good, the rooms were "ok", the crowd was "meh". If I had to pay for a hotel in Vegas with my own money however, I would not stay here.
We came here for the vegas part of our honeymoon roadtrip and the people at the flamingo did everything to make our stay there more comfortable. I slipped in a 20$ bill when we checked in for our three night stay and the girl at check-in made sure (even asked for help when she couldn't find one) we got a nice room! We ended up with a suite in the old part of the hotel and we had a really nice view of the swimming pool. There was construction going on all around the hotel but we didn't notice anything from our room. Parking was pretty good once we found out how it worked, used valet for the first two days.
very nice location  great rates  nice pool rooms are huge and clean and customer service (front desk) are great ;) will come back soon
I stayed here for my bachelorette party last weekend. Overall, the location and price were decent, but that was about it. We had a group of four and originally had booked a renovated room with two queens. They gave us an option at the counter to upgrade to a suite that was not renovated, but that was supposed still be clean and functional. We opted "upgrading" to the suite since we figured the extra space would be nice. . . They ONLY good thing about our suite was that we had extra space. However, it wasn't much of a suite. There were stains on the furniture, and in the bathroom, I found a pubic hair on one of the beds (and this was when we walked in...GROSS), and there was absolutely ZERO ventilation. Not only were there no windows that could be opened, there wasn't even a bathroom fan (isn't that required these days, especially if the bathroom doesn't have a window?). Additionally, the cord for the hair dryer in the bathroom literally started smoking after two uses. And let's not forget about the beds...we were supposed to get two queen beds, but ended up with full sized beds. Maybe they were considered queen sized when the place first opened, but these are definitely not queens by today's standards. Oh, and did I mention that we did not have a mini fridge, additional sink, or anything else that is normally standard in a SUITE? . . Aside from the room that clearly needed to be gutted and redone, room service was super pushy. Check-out is 11:00 AM at this place. It was 9:30 AM and we were in the process of getting everything packed up when we started hearing several SUPER loud knocks on the door. We opened it up and a housekeeping lady said she needed to come in and clean our room. We told her we weren't ready for her yet and to please come back later, as we just needed a little bit more time (again, check-out is at 11:00 AM) and you can refuse housekeeping if you want until you leave. She looked at us as if we were crazy or didn't totally understand what we were saying and closed the door. I'm not exaggerating when I say she began knocking frantically again in less than TWO minutes. When we opened the door to tell her to please come back LATER, she barged in with her cart and told us that she had to clean our room now because it was the last room of her shift and needed to leave. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? . . The only reasons I give this place two stars are because of the location and price (and perhaps it's not quite as bad if you get a room that's been renovated). That being said, I will be staying at a different hotel if I go back.
Hotel stay from Thursday,  April 10 - April 13, 2014. . On Thursday, I took a trip to Vegas to celebrate my friend's bachelorette party.  The bride to be and I were first timers, so the maid of honor did all the planning for us including booking our stay at the Flamingo. Also,  the bride to be and I were the first to arrive at the airport which was 11am. Vegas check ins aren't until well over 3pm, so we left the airport and killed time at In-N-Out burger to eat, catch up on old times, and wait for the MOH to arrive. . . Later that afternoon, our group was together and the MOH stood in the mile long line to get the room keys.   There were only four employees working the check in and hundreds of people in line,  it took nearly an hour just to check in.  We saw a sign that said: "rooms on the 14th floor or higher, take the Habitat Elevators" ( the elevators closest to the Flamingo and bird exhibits) so we went up to find our room. What we found instead was a literal work in progress. We stepped off the elevator and to our left was caution tape blocking off an area of rooms down a dusty hallway.  We thought we were lost until we found people coming out of rooms from the right of us so we continued on only to find that our number was back where the construction site was located. ... There was mold, debris, dust, the ghosts of Wayne Newton and Dean Martin, and creepy uprooted carpet that reminded us of 'The Shining.' the MOH quickly called the front desk and the concierge didn't even know what floor we were talking about. So she told us to come back down to the front and she would direct us to our room. We ended up walking all over the casino, getting the runaround twice before we found the right place.  I already knew off the bat that we weren't getting the nice room that's advertised on the website judging by the same creepy hallway and blocked off caution tape section near our room (different building by the way, from the original horror movie floor) and we went in and were highly displeased.  The only modern thing about our room was the floor and the paint on the walls. There was mold in the shower and on the shower curtain,  nasty stained caulk. ..there was nothing Fab or Deluxe about this room. For an extra $30 per night fee, the MOH was able to call and do a room upgrade (called the GO rooms) which should have been complimentary from all the mess we'd been through. . . We packed our things after about 20 min. in the room and once more we journeyed across the casino and waited in the line to get the new keys. Once we got off the elevator to the 19th floor, I saw the funky, new, carpeting that I'd recognized from the website and took a huge sigh of relief.  Our room was adorable especially the view and the bathroom where I took advantage of watching TV from the shower as often as possible. . . So here is the Flamingo in a nutshell:. . Pros: . . - beautiful exterior and interior for one of the oldest hotels on the strip. . . - Margaritaville Casino and restsurant downstairs.. . - Flamingo habitat,  pool deck, and wedding chapel.. . - express check out saved us a headache and hours in line.. . - bag check before check in and after check out while waiting for a taxi was very reliable.. . - directly connected to the Linq outdoor shopping and dining center.. . Cons:. . - they have people living on the floors that are still under construction for renovations...health hazard much?!?. . - getting the run around  from concierge because they didn't know where our room was located.. . - False advertising for rooms on the website. And you have to pay extra for a room you initially thought you were getting.. . - resort charges include spotty wi-fi for only ONE device and gym usage that isnt even open 24 hours.
Where to start... We checked in on a Tuesday afternoon and we were checked into a very nice room on the 27th floor. Problem was that the room had never been cleaned after the previous guest. Bed was not made, wet towels in the bathroom and trash still in all the bins. The front desk did respond promptly to dispatch housekeeping to clean the room.  Despite the prompt cleaning, cigarette burns on the nightstand and the cloud of marijuana smoke still lingered all week. . . Over the next few days our card keys would just stop working. They were not carried next to cell phones, magnets or any other credit cards but somehow they would just stop working. The front desk initially did very little to fix the problem and in fact they took my wife's card key and did not give her a replacement. Their solution was to have security unlock the door and let her in to look for anything that proves that she belongs to the room.  The front desk said security would give her a new key and security said the front desk would give her a new key. Classic buck passing and indifference.  Finally I had to leave my conference to go to the front desk and demand new keys. . . That night when we came back to our room there was a drunk guy passed out in the hallway.  The following night my coworkers room was broken into and items were stolen. Clearly security does very little to patrol the hallways of the guest floors. After the break in and theft, guest services and security did nothing to try to alleviate the situation or improve the customers opinion of the hotel. . . The only plus to this place was the location which is pretty central to everything on the strip. I will look elsewhere for lodging in the future.
I was kicked out of the pool here by a security guard named Richard L. because he said I was dancing in the middle concrete slab. When I told him it wasn't me, then he told me to point them out. I wouldn't point them out, and he told me I had to leave. I filed a complaint with the security supervisor and was not taken seriously. I don't plan on ever coming back here again
As the updates show, I've been staying here forever. So here's what you need to know:. . 1. If you don't have a Total Rewards card before you arrive, stop at the desk and get one. Then when the check-in line is a mile long you can check in at a kiosk and skip the wait. Or if you're a player and you score Diamond status you can go off in a fancy check-in lounge. I'm a low roller, so the kiosk is usually how I roll.. 2. The later in the day you check in, the less likely you are to get the room you wanted. If your flight gets in late at night, just plan on rolling with it. If you're staying a few days you can always move rooms the next day. . 3. The location on the Strip is ideal. You're across from Caesar's, next to the Quad, next to Bally's, across from Bellagio. If you need to get to the convention center, the monorail is out back and an easy walk. The construction at the Linq is pretty much wrapped up, and the remodeling job at the former Bill's will be done in May/June.. 4. The Fab rooms are all recently redone except for the bathrooms. It's just the way it is. The Go rooms are fun, especially the funky spa shower. Some of those Go rooms are showing some wear. But overall the hotel is a good deal.. 5. The Linq next door is a lot of fun. Nothing in the Linq is cheap. If the way the lobby looks on the way to the Linq is any sign of what the future of this hotel is, a really nice remodeling job may be on the way.. 6. While I adore the waitress who has waited on me in the Tropical Breeze for years at breakfast, if I'm going to have to pay $18 for breakfast, I'll walk next door to the Quad and eat at Hash House. Plus Hash House is now open 24/7 and the Flamingo's coffee shop is now primarily breakfast and lunch. It's hard to find a cheap meal anywhere on the strip anymore.. 7. The Margaritaville casino is fun and now has more table games than before. The 5 o'clock Somewhere bar in that casino is probably the most fun bar in the hotel outside of Margaritaville itself.. 8. Carlos & Charlies is annoying. Maybe I'm just too old to understand.. 9. The Go Pool is probably the best pool in Vegas outside of Mandalay.. 10. Service is friendly in this hotel. If you're nice to the staff, they will return that kindness and reward you for it. If you're drunk and obnoxious, they will tolerate you. Don't be that guy.
Your Experience at the Flamingo is TOTALLY what you make it. If you opt for a higher floor and a GO room then it will be a great stay. If you stay on a lower floor in an older room, totally different experience and one I wouldn't be cool with. It is like staying in 2 completely different hotels. Our room was clean, the hallway carpets were new and clean, and our view was probably the best in Vegas. (stayed on the 22nd floor facing the strip). The elevators were haunted I think. Going downstairs, the elevator in the lobby tower would stop on the 11th floor almost every time. Other times, different lights would light up as the elevator was moving. Strange but kinda cool if you want to imagine that the mobsters are still haunting the place. Wasn't an inconvenience just strange. The Pool is Awesome, the Casino itself was so-so. I didn't see any big pay-outs so definitely on the tighter side but it is the Strip. Cocktail waitresses were awesome if you tipped them. Never had to wait for a drink. All in All, the Flaming is a really fun place to stay if you are cool with a relaxed vibe and not a lot of frills and luxury.
The price is good and there's a good variety of places to eat right in the hotel. Staff was also nice.. . I knocked 2 stars down though because whenever we (fiance and I) tried to go to the elevators to get to our hotel room we would constantly get harassed by people/workers standing in front of the elevators. They were very aggressive promising free shows, dinners etc., and they wouldn't take "not interested," for an answer. This happened almost every time we had to go to our room. It started to get extremely irritating. Here's a tip, when they ask, "how long are you in town?" Just say you're leaving in a few hours. That's the only way we were able to get them to leave us alone.
I will definitely be staying here when I go back to Vegas. The pool area is fantastic, although drink prices are a little high, but that's pretty much everywhere in vegas. . The hotel staff were by far the friendliest and most helpful I have encountered.. Currently parking is a pain because of construction, but just make sure you turn on "Linq Avenue" and you'll find the parking quite easily.. The room was very swanky with fake hard wood floors - so much better than carpet, and floor to ceiling windows.
It's fine but our check in was a disaster.  The girl at the front desk attempted to upgrade our room but actually upgraded us to a room that wasn't accessible due to renovations.  She sent us to the wrong elevators which didn't even go to our floor then when we found the right elevators we couldn't get to the room.  We went back to the front desk where the manager type sent us back to the Habitat elevators and assured us we could get to the room.No go.  I returned to the desk agitated and the manager type was more concerned in explaining that he was offended by my dropping of the f bomb (not cool but frustration had set in) than he was getting me into a room.  He said he didn't appreciate the language, I told him i didn't appreciate being sent to a construction zone.  Anyhow, we got another room which was fine.  It overlooked The Linq which was pretty noisy and we probably should have asked for a move but at the same time the view was cool.  Would I stay here again?  Maybe.  It's got location going for it, the grounds are nice and we liked the pool.  Our bags didn't make the flight at the airport, and the bell desk were also very helpful getting us our bags when they arrived.  So it has some good points but the check in left a bad taste in my mouth.  As a repeat visitor, I feel i deserved better from The Flamingo.
I just stayed at Flamingo for a week and for my wedding. I chose it here since they have a beautiful pool area and nice garden area for photos. I have stayed here one other time, and I hated it, but this time was an improvement. I got a fast check in at the platinum/diamond check in area, which was a plus. I just had a regular Fab room, but was surprised to have a wonderful strip view. I looked directly across from Ceasers and could see Bellagio as well. I was on the 26th floor and sat in the chaise every night before bed to look at the fabulous strip. The room itself was just ok. Cleanliness, especially the bathroom is questionable. The bed was very very comfortable though. I didn't win in the casino here, although I never do. I Ioved the pool area. I didn't eat here, so I can't comment on that. I was slightly annoyed by the time share people right when you get off or on the elevator, but I learned to just keep walking. Overall the stay was fine, no problems, and if it's comped I'd stay here again. Perfect location on the strip!!
The worst place I have ever stayed. It's better to spend a bit more for much better quality. The security is lame. The won't do anything if you've been robbed. They will literally shrug and ignore you. They will also screw up the rooms you reserved cuz they can't do their damn job and when they finally get it right, you are offered no apology. Just a lot of side eyes. Who wants to start their vacation like that? This place doesn't even try. Don't waste your money here. They'll ruin your vacation.
We decided to stay an extra day (Sunday) and we found a great deal. Usually when you get these kinds of deals, the bottom line is that you get what you pay for. We really were surprised with how much fun the pool scene was! Just an fyi, the mojitos at the pool are the slushy kind - not fresh and really not good. . . It's an old hotel (the rooms are a bit modern - not the bathroom though) and the construction from the strip to get to the self-parking is a bit mis-leading but we did enjoy our stay. We liked going through all of the new shops and restaurants that were conveniently outside of the hotel.. . We checked-in early - please note that to the right of the check-in line you can go to a kiosk and use the self check-in machine. Nobody was using it and we saved a ton of time by not standing in line! Others in line followed what we did and couldn't believe that not more people were using it. The machine even gives you your room keys! There is a concierge there who will show the rooms that pop-up and which are smoking vs. non so you can choose your floor, etc. This was super helpful! . . Back to it being an old hotel, one of the elevators would not open it's doors to our floor and we thought we were stuck. That was a bit disturbing when we tried it twice - we just got in another elevator. . . Since we checked in early, the computer for our check-in must not of let housekeeping know that we were there because our bed was unmade. I tried calling the front desk and our room phone didn't work. So, we proceeded to get ready to head to the pool when housekeeping came. We definitely surprised her that we were there. She made the bed and was super friendly and gave us tips about the new shops.. . Don't forget to place your privacy note on the door, they will start knocking as early as 6 AM. Also the walls are thin ( did I mention it's old?) so you can hear housekeeping knock on the doors and hear the people in the bathroom next to you. You can also hear the music from the shops below - it's pretty loud around 7 in the morning! If you are a light sleeper, make sure you drink a lot and you won't hear a thing. :)
Fail! Long check-in wait, dirty hotel hallway. It smells so bad. Room key didn't work at 1am and it turned into a huge to-do for them. I would def not stay here, however the Mirage was nice and they took great care of us at 2am when we left Flamingo.
