Loved the idea to combine these two types of food!  Bulgogi on nachos and burritos? Genius!  Taste was pretty good and had a great hole in the wall feel.
I went in the other day just to take a peek at the menu while I was waiting for my insurance agent. They offer a full menu at competitive prices. They made upgrades to the dining area since that last time I've been there. ( got rid of those seat pads) The house fried rice and boglie ( spell check) nachos are a must. I will be back very soon.
Holy cow- pulling into Komex I seriously started to doubt the hype of this place, until I cracked open the menu and saw a large selection with low prices. . . I had the bulgigi sliders and burrito. The two combined cost less than $10! The bulgigi is a very tender meat, similar to a pulled pork. I wouldn't have tried it without the several suggestions from Yelpers!. . This is definitely a place I will go back to, more and more to try new things! Bring $10 cash (+ tip) it will be more than enough!
Went back yesterday for some lunch with the wife and pops.. I was honestly let down at how the place has changed.. -The original owners aren't running the place or cooking, the staff aren't even the same.  You just don't get that warm and inviting feeling when you walk in.  The gentleman at the front doesn't seem to appreciate busy business; he likes it slow.  The service definitely changed; Linda was always on top of her game, I don't think these people have the same drive and motivation as they did.. -The food didn't taste the same either.  What can I say; I love Sonny's cooking.  If you gave me 50 plates of the same dish and sonny cooked one of them; I could tell you which one was Sonny's.. I think I'll be going to their new location from now on; which I heard has awesome specials that you can't get here.. My food was still very good this visit, but just wasn't the same; I'll miss the ole' place.
Speechless! We now have a reason to come to Vegas! This is a small hole in the wall place in a small shopping plaza. We were kind of skeptical at first just because of the restaurant itself but we were very much surprised when the food came out. The bulgogi meat tacos were made to perfection, all the ingredients tasted amazing. It was something I had never experienced before.... I was in taco heaven! We were kind of disappointed because we were not able to try their pork tacos, they apparently were waiting for their shipment.  But next time we are in town we are definetly returning to KOMEX!
I found the food terrible. The food was very bland, dry and left you wanting something else. Nothing Korean or Mexican about it..... I expected great flavor from a fusion place. The dining area is also somewhat dirty.
What can I say about Komex?. . Small hole-in-the-wall in a plaza with an extremely small parking lot, be sure to expect it to be packed on weekends. The restaurant itself is pretty small. For groups larger than 4, it might be a bit hard to get seating during rush hours on the weekend. . What other place can you get the check for under $15 for two people? This place is awesome. Tacos are amazing with plenty of choices. You can get them on corn or flour and you get three choices of meat--pork, chicken, or beef. If you want it with kimchi, you can get it for a bit extra! Tacos are around $2-$3-something. If you're watching your figure (you shouldn't, you look fabulous), you can get it on lettuce leaf instead of corn or flour tortilla. . . Meats are all flavorful. My favorite is the pork. These tacos come loaded with slaw and meat. You definitely won't leave hungry. Service is usually good. There was a time they had a couple of new servers kind of slacking, but lately, they've been on it. . Fried rice here is bomb, especially when you're drunk or hungover. The half sizes for their fries, fried rice etc. are huge here!  Enough to feed a few small children. Even when you order one taco and get a half-size of their teriyaki chicken, you're going to have to share with people. Imagine how bog their full-size is! Yeah, that big. And not the kind that girls are happy with..  . Komex is always the best place to get food on the cheap. My bill between my friend and I is normally between $12-$17 (if we're just doing tacos). Perfect spot for lunch or dinner. Wish it was open later than 8pm daily, but it's not. It's a great local find!
When you can't decide between Korean food or Mexican food, Komex is the perfect choice! . . The complimentary chips and guacamole were delicious. However, I didn't really care for the salsa, it had a weird artificial, vinegar preserved taste. . . This is what we ordered: . (make sure to add hot sauce and salsa on your tacos and kimchi fried rice, before you eat them! They all needed that extra pop of flavor and salt. The salsa tray is available, you can either grab it yourself or ask for it.). . Bulgogi tacos - the beef had great flavor! It was tender and the rest of the taco was delicious. . . Pork tacos - the pork marinade was a little weak, but add on some hot sauce and salsa and it's just right. . . Pork belly tacos - these had yummy pork belly bits in the taco. My boyfriend said he only got a bite of just fat, but I had a different bite and it was tasty.. . Kimchi bulgogi fried rice - it had nice chunks of kimchi with beef and a fried egg on top. I topped it with some hot sauce and it was addicting! . . Wonton soup - the soup came out piping hot. The broth tasted comforting and the flavor was good. The wontons were homemade and the meatball was yummy as well. I would love eating this when I'm sick. . . I would definitely come back to try their other fusion favorites.
What can I say about a place that provides intensely flavorful treats at an affordable price; FINALLY! . When you enter the door the restaurant is plain, nothing over the top, just comfortable and intimate. We were seated and brought drinks and free chips and salsa with homemade guacamole. Who does that? How awesome! We then were told about the $5 special that was 3 bulgogi tacos and a drink. It's less than eating McDonalds, but quality food. I cannot say enough nice things about what we ate or the service. For the first time in my life after eating we ordered 2 more specials and a plate of fried rice to go to eat for dinner. Such an awesome experience.
Girlfriend and I went to Vegas for a weekend getaway an decided to hit up KoMex for the first time. On to the review.. . Service: 5/5 The second we walked through the door we were greeted with smiles. The server told us to sit anywhere we would like and promptly came to provide us with the menu and answer any questions. Throughout our visit she would frequently stop by to check on us. Very attentive.. . Food: 3/5 The food was decent. We had the bulgogi burrito and taco. The burrito was ok, but none of the flavors really wowed me. I also had a bulgogi plate with white rice just to see how it stands against other Korean places. It wasn't up to par. Their wonton soup, however, was amazing.. . Price: 4/5 You can fill up your tummy without emptying your wallet. There are cheaper options around, but of course you came here for Korean/Mexican!. . Overall: 3/5 stars based on my first and only visit. There are other dishes on the menu that I would definitely want to try, so this is not my final visit nor is it final review.
