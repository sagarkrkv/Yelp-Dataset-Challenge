Gallo is one of my favorite Taquerias in Phoenix. This and Taco Guild give each other a run for the money. I love everything about gallo, the atmosphere, the service, and the food. Have a bite to eat and a delicious drink and head up to the rooftop bar on a Weekend!
I am obsessed with this place. I'm not sure if it's the amazing food, the cool vibe or the history of the Don Bolles incident....or a combination of all three.  I love the guacamole and street tacos.  The Micheladas are bomb too!  I love GB ! My only complaint is the last couple times I've been the wait was over 45 minutes - I've been going to GB for years and never had to wait!
Love this place. More "southwest" food than Mexican.. Slow service, but worth the wait.. Order the classic margarita and the guac. . And make reservations if you want to go on a weekend evening, otherwise you might wait an hour and a half for a table.
I've been to Gallo Blanco several times.  At first, we loved coming because the food was good and they had a superb happy hour.  For us, the trip to Gallo Blanco is a 30+ minute trip, so we have somewhat high expectations.  I'm not sure if the chef or owner or something changed, but we headed here last month and had the worst experience.  The front house staff was rude to us.  The bartender was the same.  Our waitress was OK, but very inattentive.  These things I can ignore, but the food was awful.  My boyfriend's torta was reportedly good, but all of the tacos that our group ordered were cold and the fish was tough.  Further, they forgot part of our order and never took it off of our bill.  Very disappointing.  We will not be back!
The food here is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, and the servers are very friendly.  This is our "go to" place for out of town guest to experience wonderful Mexican food.  Why then do I not give 5 stars, well, its quite simple, their take-out system is pretty mediocre.  My view, either be better at take-out, or don't do it.  We do take out from there often (as we love the food), but beware they are almost always later than expected, often lose your ticket, or the food will be cold.  I think they would be better served by nixing take-out, although I would be devastated since I get it often.  My solution has become, I order take-out, then go and wait immediately, to avoid cold food or delayed expectations.  I will say every time our food has been truly subpar, they have made it right, and that the customer service of this place is far and away the best in the valley.
Holy moly! Yummy Tacos and half price on Tuesdays! Goo eat here, so delicious.
We went here Friday night for dinner.  When I first walked in I loved the atmosphere.  We started off with a guacamole appetizer.  The guacamole tasted very fresh and authentic, I would of liked a little more spice. I love horchata and order it whenever available.  I liked the touch of the cinnamon sprinkled on the top. My entree was the chicken chiliquiles. This was a great meal and tasted good.  Again I love heat and there was none.  I will be returning, I will just special order and add jalepenos to my order. We ended our night with a strawberry Tres leches topped with ice cream, this was super moist tasted really good.  If your taking children they eat for free under the age of 10.
There are places that you talk about to visitors as a must taste and there are places that you will miss when you move. Gallo Blanco is both of those things to me. . . I've been there near the beginning and I've seen them adapt from feedback and change over time, all while maintaining a consistent Mexico City style to their food with excellent quality.I have yet to brining a single guest here that doesn't speak highly of it when they leave.. . Drinks: Picoso if you like spice, tangy and spicy "margarita".. Food: Guacamole for starters and the Elote, for variety go a 1/2 Torta and a few tacos. Ahi comes and goes from the menu, but if there is a Ahi Taco go for it you wont be disappointed.
I waffled between 4 and 5 stars, but the 5 won! Here we go:. . I made areservation for a large party about a week before the date for our meal. When my best friend got to Gallo Blanco, the hostess said my reservation was nowhere to be found. On a Saturday. With a reservation for 9 people. YIKES. To put it lightly, I was pretty upset. The restaurant was packed and I was HUNGRY. I specifically had made the reservation so far in advance, had spoken with the person on the phone for quite a few minutes, where she got my name, phone number, we repeated the dates back to each other, etc. Needless to say, I was bothered. This wasn't the first time this had happened to me recently (but it was at another restaurant) and it just kind of bummed me out.. . We ended up waiting 25 minutes for our table, which was frustrating. But luckily, one of the staff came over a few times to let me know that they were working on it and wanted to make sure my birthday dinner went as fabulously as possible, which I definitely appreciated. When we finally got seated, our server, Henry, was outstanding! He immediately got right in the game and got my appetizer orders (queso with veggies and guacamole, YUM) and came back for drink orders a minute or so later. He had great knowledge of the menu and our food came out quick, hot, and DELICIOUS. . . I tried one of my fiance's veggie tacos and it was soo yummy. I had the Ensalada Cortada and loved it. The AZ Margarita was so delicious I had to have two! One of my girlfriends ordered the elote which was the best I've had, and everyone else loved their shrimp tacos, tostadas, and carne asada tacos. . . But what really set them above the rest and made me want to write this review was that, as an apology for the lost reservation, they gave us some complimentary desserts. We ended up getting the orange cake, the lime tart (not on the menu, but recommended to us by our server), and the flan. Holy moly. All of the desserts were beyond delicious. I wished I hadn't eaten so much beforehand because I wanted to devour the leftover desserts!. . What could have been a bad situation ended up being wonderful. Gallo Blanco really took care of us and I will DEFINITELY be back!
I heard such high regard for this place that I was thrilled to attend a birthday dinner last night. The atmosphere is lively and entertaining with Spanish dancers and musicians. This is why I'm giving 3 stars.  Our margaritas were sub par and obviously cheap tequila because of my headache this morning!  Ceviche was good but the chips served were hard and tasteless. My enchiladas had a tasty verde sauce but they were barely warm. Rice was tasteless too. I think this place is more about urban chic hype than good food. If you go stick to tap beer for happy hour and get dinner somewhere else!
Nos hospedamos en el Clarendon anoche por lo que necesitabamos algo para no dormir con el estomago vacio. . Pedi el elote callejero, tenia ganas desde hace meses de un "esquite" como le decimos Mexico. La verdad creo que la combinacion queso, crema y paprika son excelente y el elote muy suave y lechoso. . La hamburguesa esta muy rica y se ve que la carne esta hecha por ellos (cuando menos eso senti). . El dueno es del Distrito Federal asi que hay que felicitarlo por el menu tan mexicano con los toques internacionales.
So here's another place where I had a night and day difference between my first  two visits. My sisterand I came here in August for my birthday. It was taco Tuesday so we were able to chow down on some tasty discounted tacos (veg for me, chicken and fish for her). We also had some great cocktails including a delicous spiked melon agua fresca. The only disappointing item on that visit was the the elote which definitely didn't live up to its reputation.. . I came here again last Saturday with my husband and neighbors after a play. I was happy we happened to be there just in time for the end of happy hour. This time, I had to try their much-lauded chilaquiles. I was initially disappointed with my first few bites. The veggies didn't really go with the dish, and the sauce was way too tame. Then my disappointment turned to disgust as I realized I was eating chicken! I think the kitchen realized at the last minute they put chicken in my vegetarian dish and tried to get most of it out, but there were some chunks left behind. At the same time, I was drinking a horrible spiked watermelon agua fresca that I also had to send back. At least the blood orange margarita was good.. . I am giving GB two stars because my husband loved his tacos, more so than our neighborhood joint, Joyride. I don't think I will return, however.
We stayed at the Clarendon so it made sense for us to want to try Gallo Blanco. It had rave reviews from both Yelp and the hotel staff. Our reservation wasn't for a couple of hours, so we decided to order a couple appetizers and drinks from the bar to bring near the pool area. The woman behind the bar was pretty stand off-ish, but she was downright pleasant compared to the waiter who took our order for the app's. Not only did he get the order wrong, and accuse me of giving him an incorrect order, he was just straight up rude. I do know his name, but won't print it, as I'm hoping he was just having an off day. The staff that we did deal with made us feel like we were totally inconveniencing them. Needless to say, we cancelled our reservation at the 11th hour.
My first experience to gallo was with a meetup group. The food was good and location was cute..the waitress we had seemed to be out of it or just not used to having more than a couple tables.  Although we were a group of 8.  She seemed calm but yet it wasn't busy except outside. Our table numerous times was being sought out by the group as she didn't cater to well to us.   At the end, I needed to leave early so I asked if she could split the check.  She said sure and came back with it.  It was $24.   I gave my cc and then she came back with my card charged to a tune of 138.    .....after a 10 days of realizing that my authorization of 138 wasnt dropping off. I called to talk to the manager and to have them call me back in regards to a cc charge.  4 more calls over the next 11 days and I finally get a call...why did they wait this long...once I got a hold of the manager she was nice but very much not so on top of returning the call.   I took off one star for the waitress and one star for the management neglecting my concern for so long.  The employees on the phone when I called seemed really nice and sincere..I believe they made the effort to get my number relayed. ...will I go back...probably not because I have plenty of other choices out there.
So good try the breakfast burrito it's so good
Went in for weekday lunch... Servers sitting around bullshitting, hostess seemed mad that we showed up and interrupted their fun... Despite an abundance of tables and unoccupied workers, we were told there was a half hour wait time. Won't bother giving them a second chance.
Outstanding food.  So popular the wait can annoy, but if your timing is right, a 5 star place!
