Buffets.. A place to binge on almost any kind of food you can imagine. You would think almost every buffet on the Strip deserves a 4 or 5 star rating, but there are exceptions.. . Let's start off with the fact that the waiting line is located super close to some of the dining areas. My group was seated near the entrance of the buffet and the line got ridiculously long that some of the people were standing right in front of us. Normally this wouldn't really be that much of a problem, but it does when they are standing in the way of me and my path to food.. . Its your average buffet with food ranging from mediterranean to asian to mexican to seafood. I'm a seafood lover so I will ALWAYS find myself heading straight to the crab legs ;) What can I say? I want to get my moneys worth. This buffet has 2 small trays with crab legs =( It's quite depressing when I'm use to the World Carnival Buffet at the Rio having a HUGE selection on crab legs. I still found myself getting 2 plate servings though. If there's crab legs, I'm eating it.. . Nothing else was really appealing to me. I had some of their 3-cheese ravioli which I found too heavy even for italian food. The pesto alfredo was alright - nothing worth raving about OR putting down. I guess the last thing I can add about this place is it is poorly lit. It's a little dim for my liking, but that's a personal preference.. . All in all, this buffet may just be a pass for me. There are better buffets out there with higher quality in food and bigger selections.
We tried the Brunch buffet in pH on Saturday afternoon. The wait was there - around 30 mins. In many ways this is your typical Vegas buffet, but I loved the food and the service. . I almost paid double the amount for the Cosmopolitan buffet the last time and there was, double the wait, half as much variety, poor service and they stop refilling items after a while. The drink service here was prompt and great. They included all sorts of beer, wine, mimosas, sodas, ice teas, etc. in the brunch. Mimosas were really nice. The staff was friendly and efficient.  . . Food - I am usually not a huge buffet fan, but everything that I tried was tasty. They have seafood, breakfast, Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian, Country and an Asian section and a huge desserts variety. The Mediterranean section had some succulent lamb and chicken options. Tons of vegetarian options overall - , nachos, hummus, soups, salads, 3 types of veggie pizzas, noodles, rice, tofu, veggie spring rolls and much more. The desserts section was fantastic - exquisite cupcakes, candy floss, ice cream, cheesecakes etc. There were also made to order eggs, crepes, pancakes and fresh waffles. . . Definitely give this place a try and don't think twice if you are a vegetarian, you will have plenty of options. If you want a good buffet for a good price, Spice Market is the place to try!
If you're looking for a fancy, upscale venue, this is not for you.  You are literally sitting in the basement, with no special decor.  But if you just want a large variety of food at a cheap price, this place is a pretty good deal.  We came here with the Buffet of Buffets pass and it was our first stop for a late dinner.  Our favorites were the crab legs, sole stuffed with crab, lamb skewers, lamb tangine, and the macarons.  There were a ton of other stations to chose from, but the seafood and middle eastern stations looked the freshest.
Dry, bland, overcooked, soggy with weird service. For the same price, just go eat dinner somewhere close by. P-Ho has a lot to offer: Cheeseburger in Paradise, PBR, Planet Dailies, Bugr to name a few.
This was our "go to" buffet in Vegas. WAS!! Let me start by saying the wait staff was excellent. Not a single negative thing to say about a any employees.  Now with that said, the food was terrible. It honestly felt as though I was in a Hometown Buffet or a Sizzler. The different stations had very limited selections and the food was quit frankly bland. You have to be a "VIP or Gold Card Member" to have the crab legs steamed. Not a huge fan of ice cold crab legs. As good as this buffet used to be, it is now only mediocre at best. Won't be back to the PH buffet anytime soon.
The food was good, just a little bit better than an ordinary buffet.  But it's Vegas, so the best part is the the size of the buffet and the many choices!
This buffet is ok! I went for the steak and mashed potato. They were pretty good. And then you have 2 options for the crab legs: hot or cold. Awesome! I am somewhat disappointed with the desert because there is not that much variety. They have a lot of cupcakes. I think a child will find that exciting. If it was as good as a Sprinkles cupcake, then great! Cupcake all you can it is! But it isn't. =( I gave it a four star because they serve steamed crab legs which not all buffet in Vegas do anymore.
This buffet is above average as far as Vegas buffets go.  They have quite a good range of different foods, and most are fresh and tasty.  The desert area leaves a little to be desired.  Cakes and cupcakes are dry and many of the deserts are blande.  No crab legs at lunch!  Love the mimosas.  Coffee was good too and service was good.  Fun place to come with friends on a day off!
We bought a Groupon, two dinner buffets, with unlimited drinks, and that day Groupon special, $36.75 not bad. The food pleasantly surprised us, better than Kumi in Mandalay Bay (sad to say). But the unlimited drinks such as the wine, was kind if nasty. They come in water glasses so they don't have to bring you more and more and the wine tastes dirty, like cheap wine does. But the food was totally worth the money. They had a lot of things vegetarians would eat, since i have recently become one ( 6 weeks now), with salad and pastas, grilled veggies and seafood, even cheese quesadillas. Of course they do have the standard meat options and some Brazilian style skewers as well. Worth the try, very underestimated.
We're there on Sunday.  The food and service were horrible.. Especially the hostesses were so rude.  To me they should not be in service at all.. Flatware, dishes, and utensils are all dirty.. They served wine in dirty glasses with lipstick . On them. And when they were asked to bring. a replacement glasses, they really gave us the attitude.. I'd not come back to this place anymore, and . Would not recommend anyone to come unless. You want to get the same service that I got!
The deal on Groupon was two adult buffets for $45.  We thought it was well worth it for the unlimited drinks and food so we hopped on that deal immediately. Turns out that the food was subpar and quite limited in variety. For a place to market themselves as an international buffet they may have had 2 to 3 selections at each station.. . Our waiter Tedesse, was the only thing that made this place worthwhile. He was a great guy with a great sense of humor and made sure that our drinks were never empty. He even agreed to bring us to go cups for our "sodas".
It was pretty disappointing. I would definitely go somewhere else. We got a buy one get one free coupon and it still wasn't worth it. The breakfast was decent, the rest of the food I couldn't believe how bad it taste! Like worse than cafeteria in elementary bad!
After waiting in two separate lines, one to pay and another to be seated, for what seemed like forever, we were finally able to sample the food from the various ethnic stations. I believe there was a Mexican, Italian, Asian, Middle Eastern, American, Seafood, Soup and Salad stations as well as dessert. To keep this review on the shorter side I'll say that the food I tried from the various stations were all pretty good for the most part but there were one or two items from the various sections that I didn't think were that good compared to other places. The pork fried rice in the Asian area, was one let down. It had a weird taste and there was little to no pork in it at all. Definitely a dish that needs to be revamped. The pork buns were very delicious and for me, it was the highlight of the Asian area. Each station only has a few items to choose from which was pretty disappointing. I guess I just expected a little more variety from each station than what we were offered.. .  The dessert station was pretty nice in my opinion. The variety in this area was satisfying. There were various flavors of cupcakes as well as different mini cakes, pastries, tarts, cotton candy and even ice cream. There was so much I wanted to try but had to keep my sugar intake to a minimum. Most of the delicious treats they offered I just took a bite of just to say I tried it. There was something there to satisfy anyones sweet tooth for sure. Now back to the food stations for a sec. If I had to choose a station I enjoyed the most it would definitely be the Middle Eastern one. Most of the offerings at that station were just delicious! I had the tandoori chicken, lamb, beef kabobs, curry chicken and curry lamb and they were by far my favorites in the entire buffet. Oh, and the mac n cheese in the American section was the best i've had out of the two buffets I've visited in Vegas. . .  The service here was pretty good. Our server was great about keeping our cups filled and our empty plates off the table. Overall it was a satisfying experience and I would come here again in the future but they should definitely try to add a few more dish options in a few of the stations that were lacking.
