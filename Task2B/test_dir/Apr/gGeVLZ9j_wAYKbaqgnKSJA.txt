Went here to grab a lil sushi and was a lil disappointed. The place is amazing inside. Very hip and chic. The ingredients were very fresh, but the presentation was what I would expect from my neighborhood sushi joint and flavors did not excite like I would have expected. That being said, we did not really explore the menu and would give them another shot.
Loved every dish we tried.. Fabulous cocktails and phenomenal service.. I will be back!
The food is just average at best but the service is HORRIBLE - diner quality really.  Service:  The server acted like he was doing me a favor by waiting on me. He would drop food off and go.  Never asked how anything was or if I needed something. Didn't clean off finished / dirty dishes. . . Food:  the appetizers that people raved about on here weren't on the menu, my broiled snapper arrived way too fast and barely warm. I suspect it was precooked and heated slightly before it arrived in front of me. And the taste?  If I wasn't starving I would have sent it back.  No fortune cookie either. . . Just another lousy chain with bad service.
Amazing food, our waiter was fantastic and the manager we talked to was great. Only negative was the hostesses who were fairly rude. Would recommend to anyone heading to Vegas. Chinese sausage was divine and the drinks were delicious.. Quick entry to the night club after dinner was a big plus.
Best sushi we've ever had. Atmosphere, food and the waiter (Sam) were AMAZING. Because we ate there we got free entrance into the night club afterwards, which was also amazing. . . I usually hate sushi, but this sushi was very smooth and exceeded all of my expectations. Everyone I was with said that my sushi expectations are going to be extremely high after eating at Tao. Thanks for a great night!!!
The food is average at the best, especially for the price.  Between myself and my party we had the ribeye steak, kung pow chicken,  fried rice with pork, and the sea bass. The sea bass was the only thing good...oh and donuts dessert was Horrible!... I can't believe how many people give this place such a high rating.
Checked in for our 10pm reservation. Were finally seated by 10:35pm. They sat us at a table that didn't fit our group. When someone in our group inquired about the available booth, they should have said no, you have too many people. Instead we were squished in like sardines. Menu is very limited, quality nothing to write home about. They gave us all sticky forks, and we had to ask for new ones. Service was average. Atmosphere was mostly watching people walk up to the club.  There are better places with similar cuisine in Vegas.Did not meet expectations.
Visited on 4.13.14. I LOVE TAO!. The atmosphere was great, the food was delicious and the service was top notch!. We had a reservation and were seated promptly. Our waiter was very friendly and I liked that he gave us many options on what tasted best. We ordered 7 different plates to share between my group of 6 and it was more than enough food! All the plates were mouth watering good! The real stars of the course was the kung pao chicken, toro toro roll and the roast pork lo mein.. so good! The lychee martini was so refreshing that I had to order 1 more! I would totally come back to dine here again.. P.S. the sake portions here are HUGE!!
This place was amazing the decor and the atmosphere, it had a lot of energy the food and service was top notch. There is a nightclub also in the the place it appears to be one of the hottest spots on the Vegas strip we had a wonderful time this is a keeper.
The best item to order isn't even on the menu: the tasting menu.  I didn't know about this secret the first time I ate there and had wound up ordering the sea bass, which I found to be overly hyped.  The tasting menu consists of a multi-course meal of items selected by the chef depending on your food preferences and your price point ($60-$120 per person).  If you're in town for a short time and don't see yourself visiting again any time soon, the tasting menu is what to request!
The BEST food I've ever had in Vegas.. . I got a sushi roll (was advised against anything with salmon in it by our waiter) & it was divine. Just enough for me. My boyfriend got the Thai peanut sauce shrimp & it was AMAZING. Light, delicate, spicy, lemongrass....i still dream of it!! We also split tempura scallops which was $10 for 2 (our waiter kindly advised us) & delicious.. . Our friends also loved their food, including sushi rolls. People devoured the short ribs.. . Our waiter communicated well with us as the sushi was made in one spot & other food in the kitchen. The waiter felt the ribs wouldn't be enough for 2 people but our friends got stuffed & ended up sharing.. . We also got a free desert (with naughty fortunes) for our friends birthday.. . Everyone was SHOCKED by how much we actually paid - it seemed so little for the quality!!!. . PROS: Selection, food, waitstaff, speed, decor. CONS: the guys next to us trying to hit on every girl that would sit down.. . PROTIP: apparently the bathrooms aren't labeled....
Went for dinner before a show. Food and drinks were great. Service was good. If you're in the area, just go. Stand in line if you have to. Just go.
