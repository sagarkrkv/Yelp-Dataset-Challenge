Great food, atmosphere and service. Always worth a visit.
good eats!!   far from ordinary menu choices. prompt and pleasant service.
FEZ was fantastic. We went in later on a busy Saturday night, and the staff seemed kind of harried from a busy evening - however that did not mean our service suffered. We had attentive servers from the get-go, and they answered our questions about the menu, as we had never been before. . . Make sure you try their 50/50 soup! It's beyond amazing!. . We will for sure be back.
They're food is amazing, they have a big drink selection and the service is great! The pace is more for younger people though.
I thought I give this place after all the nice reviews.  I believe the reviews are a true reflection of FEZ. I Loved the tomato lentil soup and garlicky hummus.  Great place to meet up for after work drinks.  The food is good and the service is friendly and quick.   Nice job!
FEZ's has the best drink specials. Anything on their menu is delicious. I love the trendy upbeat atmosphere.
This place has the best brunch menu and laid back environment. I haven't had a bad experience here yet.
Super salads, excellent eggs benedict, good burgers....  And don't miss the cinnamon sugar dusted sweet potato fries. We've been here twice in two days because it's really good.  And the service is friendly and efficient service (mostly - we waited a little long for entrees the first day). Go. You won't be disappointed.
Awesome drinks and very courteous staff.  Everything is amazing but the harrissa fries are to die for.
I love this place!  The drinks are always yummy and I'm addicted to their salads, some of my favorites are: fez salad, pesto caesar and classic Caesar.  Oh! and all Fez fries are delicious too!  This place is fabulous and I recommend that everyone should go there, they don't disappoint.
Yummy food and the waiter was very conscientious. I had the Fez Fit plate and it was delicious.
So made reservations here a couple months back for an open weekend. Upon arrival at the restaurant I was given great seating for my reservation. From there we got the fries(variety) were great and completely above average in taste. Then the lamb for secondary courses. Game,Set,Match. It was the best kind of awesome. Overall the only problem I had with the place is my booth seat was quite uncomfortable. Small problem I know. I highly recommend FEZ after a great initial experience. (Side note) All of my other friends and acquaintances who've come to FEZ,also love it.
Went here as I was in Phoenix one day for vacation after a trip around San Diego, Vegas, and Flagstaff.  . . Pros:. -Environment - was able to sit outside under the roof.  . -Food: Delicious!  Split the Black Bean Burger with a friend, and it was MORE than enough food.  The burger came with a delicious slaw.  . -All of the sandwiches come with salad, and you have to pay extra for fries, which I love.  Finally a place that comes with a salad.  The dressing was delicious and  lemon flavored.  . -Drinks: $4 for a bloody Mary that looked weak, but it was actually really tasty.  Right amount of spice and sweetness, and def. felt it after one.  . -FRIES: got a HUGE bowl of sweet potato fries and garlic fries.  The sweet potato fries were covered in sugar cinnamon and came with this liquid gold sauce.  I'm sure it was a million calories and mayo based, but it paired great with the fries.  The garlic ones came with ketchup and my mouth is watering just thinking about them.  . . Will have to make another trip back to PHX and check out some of their other food.  Was NOT disappointed!
We have been fans for years but the service has really gone down hill. We sat for 30 minutes with no waiter. No drinks. No appetizers. I called the lobby from my cell phone to place my drink order and the manager basically did nothing.  Our waiter eventually showed up and asked if we had decided on drinks...really?  He then offered free dessert and was really rude. We left and will never be back.  Beware. There is no excuse for bad service.
Our Security Door & Courtyard Gate was just installed by First Impressions.  We absolutely love it, look & quality is phenomenal.......GREAT curb appeal!!. . Sales Consultant Tracy McSwain was very professional & helpful in walking us through the selection process........GREAT working with him!!. . The installer Mike was VERY proficient, timely, cleaned up, & explained maintenance of door & gate.  GREAT install!! :)  Nice guy & clean cut.. . We would definitely recommend First Impression for quality, fair price, and on time delivery!!!  Just a very pleasant experience all the way around!!!! :)
Absolutely love the Fez burger and lamb sliders. Service is always great and the ambiance is fresh and hip.
My son suffered an anoxic brain injury and had just awoken from a coma of 37days upon coming to Kindred. He was trach dependent with very little movement and no use of his upper and lower extremities, along with a stage 3 bedsore on his left heel. Due to the expertise, guidance and encouragement of Kindred's entire staff, my son made phenomenal progress at Kindred during his brief stay. Through the daily guidance and support of his physical therapist, Scott and occupational therapist,Lana along with the rest of their department, he now moves and has use of all of his extremities with the exception of his left hand. He now feeds himself! He is no longer incontinent and prides himself in being able to use the bedside commode. When Langston arrived at Kindred he was speaking 2-3 word utterances. He now has conversation with joined sentences on behalf of the work of his speech therapist, Kirstie! The respiratory supervisor, Lane and his entire staff did an expediously, incredible job with his trach weaning, with completion taking place over a period of one week. We will be eternally grateful for the jump start Kindred Hospital has given him toward his full recovery
Words to describe FEZ: friendly, trendy, and delicious! My fiance is one of those vegetarians (weird, I know) and she LOVED the veggie burger. I hade the rosemary chicken and I didn't want it to end. The margaritas were so-so and my drink was a little watered down but those can be overlooked. Our waitress was nice, helpful, and prompt. She even noticed the table was a little wobbly and made it her mission to fix it. This is one place that we'll go back to try the whole menu.
Fez, has been here in downtown Phoenix for quite a few years now. It is located right next door to one of my favorite Fed EX stores. . It is always busy, and with good reason. It is really a pretty good place to go and spend some time.. It is a great location, though if you are coming from the West or North it is a bit tricky to get to the other side of the street with the light rail right there. Once you do then, the tough part is finding parking. Best to go to the far back.. The staff here is friendly and the food is pretty good. They have all kinds of specials all the time. Tuesday,(the last time I went ) has great happy hour Martinis.. I do not really drink Martinis ,but this time I did. $4.00 pretty good I think.. They even deliver now, at least around the area.
Very tasty cocktails! I am a sucker for a good flavored martini and this place did not disappoint! They are a little pricey, but I always say, you get what you pay for!
Been there several times, and service always polite and prompt.  Food good to very good.  Great neighborhood restaurant.
I love FEZ! Great trendy upbeat atmosphere. I've been here many times - brunch, lunch and dinner. The food and service is fantastic. I usually get the garlic hummus and pita as an appetizer and a burger for lunch. They're burgers are fantastic and you can taste the freshness. Nice outdoor seating area too.
I absolutely love FEZ. This is probably in my top 5 favorite Phoenix restaurants. It always has a great vibe and great food to go with it. I can't say enough how much I enjoy going there. The food is eclectic and kitsch. The drinks are also fantastic. I highly reccomend their blood marys! Go there and enjoy!
Great atmosphere. Fun place
