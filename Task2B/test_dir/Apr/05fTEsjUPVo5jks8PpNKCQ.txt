Amazing. The sides may even out perform the meats. The corn bread was just pure butter. Waffle fries and fried onions were fantastic. Ribs smoked perfectly. Just go try it
Absolutely delicious. We ordered the outlaw burger, pulled pork, brisket, and chicken. All incredible. Tender high quality meat not overpowered by BBQ sauce. One of the owners greeted us and went out of his way to be kind and helpful. The chef brought us our food and have is free potato salad and banana pudding to try, which were most delicious as well. He even came out to check on us later. The owner was very proud of he and his brother's business and said it was the American Dream. Will definitely return here next time I'm in Vegas. This is some of the best BBQ I've ever had, topped off with excellent customer service.
Man this place is insanely good. I hope it stays a hidden gem. Their beef ribs are super moist, juicy and falls right off the bone. Brisket, smoked chicken and catfish are just amazing. I brought my father in law here, who is from the south, and he said this is the best southern food he's had since he left decades ago. Definitely my go to spot a least once a week. . . Dusty is also the man.
Items Selected:. . AYCE Plate 1 - Brisket, Pulled Pork, Spare Ribs, Corn Nuggets, Hush Puppies. Banana Pudding. Corn Bread. AYCE Plate 2 - Beef Rib, Smoked Chicken, Smoked Meatloaf, Loaded Mashed Potato, Fried Onion Strings. Peach Cobbler with Blue Bell Ice Cream. . Having recently returned from a Lone Star State tour of smoked meat Meccas ranging from Black's and Snow's to Pecan Lodge and Franklin it was with modest expectations but high hopes that I approached Rollin Smoke, a space many locals and critics have hailed as the best barbeque in Las Vegas, and opting to explore the menu through a generous $24.99 all-you-can eat program I must say I walked away a (very full) believer.  Located on South Highland where outdoor smokers and burning hickory alert the senses to something more than industrial surroundings Rollin Smoke is as small and homey as many a' Texas or Kansas City 'cue spots and staffed by Razorback pitmaster Trey Holland plus a dedicated team of enthusiasts the service is every bit on par with that down south - a true love of the art noted in lengthy answers to questions about woods, temperatures, and process while simultaneously making sure every guest is content.  Featuring a diverse menu with spices and rubs harkening the style of BBQ found across the south but a bit more aggressively sweet than that in Texas it was with a trio of smoked meats, two must-order sides, and buttery cornbread that I began and although brisket was a bit drier than I'd prefer the smoke was prominent and flavor was on point - a trend extending to fatty ribs and supple pulled pork that lacked not for juices, the latter falling just short of KC's Oklahoma Joe's reference standard.  Still nibbling at the creamy corn nuggets as plate two arrived it was here that I sampled Holland's two most raved items and with a blackened caramelized crust overlying tender flesh and melted collagen the beef rib wowed just as much as the signature meatloaf, absolutely rife with hickory notes and light heat amidst a delicately packed beef.  Ignoring decent but mundane chicken and mac n' cheese I found inedibly bland compared to the rich potatoes and previous fried sides it was with a duo of desserts that I rounded out the tasting and suffice it to say that while banana pudding tastes straight from a box the focus should instead be directed to the cobbler, a bubbling bowl of soft peaches with buttery pie crust crowned with Texas' own Blue Bell vanilla - a perfect end to a pretty damned good meal by any standard.
I read about this place in the LV weekly, and after all the rave they gave them, I decided to try it for myself. I've visited rolling smoke a total of three times, and every time I try something different that was just as good, if not better than the last item.. . First a warning, as soon as you walk into this place, you will experience an instant uncontrollable flow of saliva. The smell is just AMAZING! Now that you've been warned, lets begin with the menu. My absolute favorite is the rib plate and the brisket. The ribs are tender, full of flavor and just come off the bone with ease. The brisket is equally as delicious, with a good variety of BBQ sauces to complement the already great smoked flavor. . . A few tips:. The place to me seems a little hidden, so GPS it for easy directions. You WILL come out smelling like smoke. The staff is helpful, so if you are unsure of what to get, just ask for their recommendations. . . Bon appetit!
We pickup parts next door to Rollin Smoke BBQ so this is a very convient place for us to eat. They also have sweet tea which helps on a hot summer day.. Try the chicken sandwich with Mac n cheese. It cannot be beat
WOW! This place is amazing! I've been to vegas so many times wo even knowing about this place! SO glad I was introduced bc it is seriously one of the BEST bbq I've ever had in my life! Such a RANDOM location, but the definition of a whole in the wall restaurant. Tried the pulled pork sliders, waffle fries & baby back ribs...YUM! The bbq sauce has SUCH flavor & the meat tastes so smoky & DELICIOUS! Do yourself a favor & eat here!. . Will be visiting EVERY time I'm in Vegas!
Man I walked my 12 family members more than 4 miles up and down the strip today to come here and if it wasn't "DAM good" I was never going to hear the end of it! These guys were so courteous and sat down with us to explain the whole menu.  Everything  looked exactly like the pictures and tasted like real down home barbecue.  . . You have to visit this place when you're in Vegas.  Don't be scared to stray off the strip for some real food!
It is hard to imaging better BBQ anywhere.  The only place I have tried that compares is IronWorks in Austin, TX.  I had the rib special and the beef rib was perfect.  Clinging to the bone just long enough to fall off with a slight pull.  The pork was equally amazing.  I also sampled the meatloaf which had a unique composition and flavor I loved.  Staff was super friendly.  . . Right off the strip this place was surprisingly away from the crowds.  Will clearly do this place again.  It just might be worth the 5 hour drive by itself!
Incredible BBQ!!! A must have when in Las Vegas. Pulled pork nachos were delicious. Will be returning time and time again!
Brought my coworkers here. Some of the best BBQ I've had. Make sure you get the fried onion strings as a side. Sooooo crispy and delicious.
Came here again! See I told you we would be back! This time I had the half slab babyback with bacon potato salad. Country berry cobbler for dessert. Very good!. . My gf had the wings with mac and cheese.
Amazing bbq, some of the best I have ever had, good prices and excellent service! I will definitely come here every time i visit Vegas!
Service and food is top notch at Rolling Smoke.  Called in an order for pickup, lunchtime on a Saturday.  We ordered a 1.5 racks of ribs, 1 lb. beef brisket, 3 sides of BBQ sauce, sweet potatoes, & beans.   It got busy quick with all the customers lining up, made me glad I had called in our order early.  Our order wasn't quite ready when we arrived at 12pm as they were still packing the food to go, but the guy at the counter was very nice and offered us drinks while we waited!  We were in & out in about 10-15 minutes after I paid, had a drink of sweet tea, and received our order .  It smelt so good during the car ride home, we tried the food right away.  Ribs fell off the bone, beef was tender, and the sides were all super delicious.  We were very pleased with the smoky flavored barbecue goodness which easily fed a family of 6.  Just awesome food, we'll definitely be back for more!
Without a doubt, great bbq.  Looks like a dive, but the chickrn, brisket and pulled pork were awesome.   Only regret is this place isn't closer to home.
Went there for the first time last night. Coming from a local that's tried a few amazing BBQ restaurants in town, this is definitely #1. The owner dusty was awesome and came around talking to all his customers. I will be returning!!
Super good! Cute spot, no frills. The ribs were delish! Ordered the Mac n cheese, fried okra and hush puppies. All really good!
Here's the deal. For a while, I've been searching for authentic BBQ here in the city. Chains restaurants like Dave's and Lucille's are great but missing more of that southern down home feel. Enter Rollin Smoke, located in the shadow of the Las Vegas Strip, this small eatery is does everything right.. . We got here around the lunch rush, and had to wait in a small line to order. The host/cashier was Dusty I believe, friendly guy, and he was quick and attentive. Because the staff is well prepared, the food was out within 10 minutes, very quick for a BBQ establishment, and it shows great preparation.. . I ordered the Pit Special, and for 20 bucks you get a pick of 4 meats, 3 sides and a drink. That's enough food for 2 meals or to share. I ordered a piece of the catfish on the side, which was very good as well. Catfish is hard to perfect because you have to cook it through but not over cook it. I'm willing to attest that the catfish is about as legit as it gets.. . The meat itself was fantastic, the ribs were tender but not greasy. It was nice and smoky with a good texture. Someone on here said the ribs weren't "fall off the bone", which  is correct. That's not to say it's tough, because it's not. Being smoked they way they are, they aren't greasy, they pull off the bone with very little effort. That's better than greasy, mushy "fall off the bone" people talk about when they use that phrase.. . . The sides were fantastic. The loaded mash was pretty good, not as good as some of the garlic mash I've had, BUT, excellent in it's own right. The mac and cheese was great. I'm kind of a mac and cheese snob, and nothing is as good as my moms homemade, but this was better than most BBQ/Southern restaurants. My one and only complaint was that the food could have been a bit warmer. That's it. . . For not much money you can eat like a king. Fast friendly staff, and great food makes this hidden gem a winner in my eyes.
BEST BBQ IN VEGAS!!!!! this place is awesome. the food was moist and tender the house sauce was out of this world delicious. I asked if they had a spicy BBQ sauce and the response was " challenge accepted". House sauce + Trinidad Scorpion = happy me. not only was it hot but the flavor was even better than the original sauce. . . Bottom line if you are in Vegas and like BBQ or Super Spicy food this is your place!!!
Wow, close to 400 reviews and I only heard about this place recently? How did I miss this? But then again, I rarely find myself driving on Highland Drive, which mainly seems to be a business district with strip clubs. Anyway, I'll try to keep it short and sweet. . . This place is all about the sides, I absolutely love them! I secretly think they are even better than the meat, LOL! My favorites so far are:. . Cheesy Mac N Cheese - very creamy cheese sauce, and they top it off with even more (shredded) cheese!. Corn Bread - always hot and fresh! I love how they put a good amount of butter on them and are not dry! . Corn Nuggets - one of the employees suggested that we try this, and I'm glad we did. Creamy corn on the inside. Crispy goodness on the  outside. Great with ketchup, A MUST TRY!. Kicken Beans - I don't eat beans (unless they are soybeans), but my husband and friends have said that this was delicious. . . The one side I was not crazy about were the waffle fries. They were soggy and cold the one time I had ordered them. . . OK, OK, the meats are pretty good too. My husband and I shared The Pit Special and I did like the brisket and pulled pork. Both were juicy, tasty, and cooked perfectly. Their barbecue sauce is good, but a bit tangy. I still say it's all about the sides! :P The employees are very friendly. They walk about asking if you enjoy the food and if you are happy. Drinks, utensils, condiments and to go containers are all self-serve. . . Sometimes they can get crazy busy, where the line is out the door. You know what they say, the hole in the wall places are the best! I'm glad we found this spot, I think they have the best barbecue in town!
Found this place via Yelp when it just opened and have been going there ever since. I take friends and family to try this delicious family-owned BBQ spot. Love Dusty, his dad and everyone who works there; the whole staff is super friendly! The location makes it a diamond in the rough, but it's worth the drive always! . . The food is AMAZING! You can't go wrong with anything. My favorite is the pulled piggy topped with jalapeno cole slaw. Just took a friend today and she got and loved "Dad's Favorite." They also have yummy dessert options. I always get the sweet tea when I go; it's a staple. . . If you're reading this and haven't gone, what are you waiting for?! :)
Came back again recently. I had to give them credit where credit is due and up my rating from 4 to 5 stars. Some pretty darn good BBQ, great sides, and awesome sweet tea. I will definitely be back whenever I'm in town. Can't go wrong, $11 for 2 meat, 1 side, & drink.
I seek BBQ wherever I go and this is the best I've had. It's an absolute go to every time we are in Vegas.
Why are you still wasting your time looking for over priced food on the strip. Quick head over to Rollin smoke barbeque and enjoy the best BBQ in Vegas.  I had brisket and pull pork only 10.99. You can't find that on the strip.
I found this BBQ place through Yelp.. . Location: We went at night, not a well lit parking lot or lit sign, we were near a lot of strip clubs, but the lot was full, so we decided to peek inside.. . Service: You get in a line, order and pay, and hope to find a seat. The wait was an hour to get our food. People who ordered after us got served before us, which was maddening. The staff brings your food, but that is all. . . Food: Big portions! Had that good BBQ flavor and they had 2 different sauces you could use. . . Overall: Staff could be a little friendlier and more helpful with ordering, maybe implement a seating system, and invest in some signage for the street that is lit for when its dark.
Found this place by yelp and stopped in for dinner with my gf... Cheap prices and amazing food :) highly recommended if your looking for smoked BBQ, I'll def return and recommend this place to others
This spot was all the hype it was even on the news. We went there last night. And was very disappointed. The ribs was fatty. No banana pudding and no peach cobbler. No potato salad. We won't be coming back. Very small dining room.
I have only eaten her once but I was impressed. When I first pulled up I was hesitant but after I walked in I no longer felt that. The staff was super nice and the food was very good. I will defiantly return.
Ok, saw this on triple D and have been looking for good Que since I have arrived 6 yrs ago. I think I have accomplished that! . We had the mighty beef ribs, spare ribs, and boy were they good!. Beef rib moist n meaty fun finger food. The 1/2 rack of the spare ribs... also tried the mac n cheese (forgettable.. Very creamy but no cooked crust and not so flavorful), and the kicken beans. I can't WAIT to go back.
Wow this hole in the wall rocks! Their food is great and huge and for a great price.  . I took close friends there and they loved it ( being that they are over 6 feet tall and 200 plus and always hungry)
Well from being raised in the south and going to school in Texas I like to think I know a little bit about good BBQ. This place in my opinion has the best BBQ in Vegas! Everything about it reminds me of a down home southern BBQ spot! I usually get the pulled pork sandwich aka the "Pulled Piggy" and every time I get it it's amazing and constant! If your in the mood for some good down home southern BBQ come check this place out!!
I went here just expecting it to be another hyped up BBQ spot that was going to disappoint me, but boy was I wrong.  Immediately when you walk in the menu is right there HUGE on the wall, I loved that. I didn't have to strain my eyes to see anything and the menu was very straight forward. I ended up getting the Outlaw burger.................................................WOW!!!!! it's everything a burger needs to be. Everything complimented each other very well, the amount of sauce and toppings on my burger were perfect. I was just really shocked. As for my side, I grabbed waffle fries....which are always fire. Definitely hit this place up if you're looking for some real deal BBQ. They definitely have my stamp of approval!!
This place was recommended by a family member who aye here last week. Just got done running a 1/2 marathon and was looking for some protein. BBQ here we come! It was tough to pick one thing to get so we shared the pit plate. Pulled pork, tri-tip and ribs. Sides were Mac-cheese, greens, cole slaw and corn bits! Everything was so good. The smoke ring on the ribs were pure perfection and everything tasted great. They have this burger that is the size of a football and looks awesome, but it would take a REALLY big stomach or to be shared by two. . . It was too hard to find and it has lots of seating. Staff was awesome!!! Will return the next time we hit Vegas!
Ok this place is off the hook! Ate there last Tuesday April 15th, had the Outlaw burger and Mac and cheese, the wife had the brisket, chicken and pork baby backs. These guys know how to smoke meat, the bark is awesome and the smoke ring is perfect! The Outlaw burger is EPIC, it's made with their smoked brisket and is about 6" tall when served, good luck getting this in your mouth. The wife's ribs were cooked perfectly to competition standards and man what a flavor. . . We had to go back for round 2 and hit the place up on Saturday April 19th. This time I got the smoked meat loaf and a hot link, the wife got 3 types of ribs, the pork, the baby back and the beef rib. The meat loaf was the best I have ever had, smoked meat loaf is the the only way to make meat loaf, I can't wait to try it in my smoker! The wife's pork ribs were perfect again, but wait the beef rib is the bell ringer! This thing is actually prime rib on a stick (rib) it's about 3" thick and done perfectly, the smoke ring, bark and flavor are the radical, this is smoked prime rib at its finest. My only dig would be the hot link wasn't cooked enough (luke warm), but the flavor was great. We will be back, every time we are in Vegas, I can't wait!!. . On another note you'll be safe at this place, every cop in town eats there. 3 squad cars were in the parking lot when we pulled up and then 3 more showed up when we were eating. I don't know who was covering the streets of Vegas, but they were all eating well! I had to have the tee shirt, way to go Rollin smoke!
Tried this place after a search or barbecue in Vegas, still looking for a great spot.  So gave it a try and got the Biggin' sandwich which is a combo of their brisket, pulled pork and hot link all on the same bun.  The bun, is great. Soft and soppy.  The meat, 2 out of 3 were outstanding.  The hot links are great and made in house.  The pulled pork was as good as I've had in Vegas. Didn't care as much for the brisket.  I didn't hate it and it was tender, but it just didn't hold up flavor wise to the other meats..    Their Mac n cheese side was solid as was their peach cobbler.  Def gonna come back and work on some more menu items. So far this is the best BBQ in town.
Ok again I'm going against the grain and sticking to what I know, good southern bbq! This place is ok but far from the mark. The beef ribs were too fatty, the pork ribs weren't fall off the bone and skimpy. The flavor was pure smoke only. No real sense of the bbq flavor. The yams were drenched in liquid sauce and couldn't mix it in so it ruined it for me. And sorry to say as I was excited for cobbler, but this is far from cobbler! Gosh this is making a trip down south seem overdue! . We called ahead our order and still waited a long time as they just said overwhelmed by orders. The little one wouldn't eat the ribs she was so excited for either. I so wanted to like this place so I can have a bbq place in town based on a lot of people's reviews but needless to say I'll keep on looking....
Okay so here we go the BBQ needed more flavor the top part where the smoke was was okay but when you get into the rib it had no flavor the brisket was the same way I'm a chicken was the same way really lacked flavor when you bit into it the rib tips however had a lot of flavor also good was the corn nuggets and the banana pudding the peach cobbler didn't float my boat now let's get onto the hamburger it had a lot of flavor is very moist and I would order it again but that's only if I go back I'm still looking for the best barbecue in Las Vegas and Dave's barbeque still is the best in my opinion years ago they had a gates barbecue in town but it closed down because the owners son like to gamble which is a shame because that was the best barbecue in Las Vegas they're also famous in Kansas City and still have a store there all in all not the best barbecue in Vegas I'm going to keep searching
When you think BBQ what do you think of? Famous Daves? Lucilles? Memphis bbq? I was confused for many years thinking that these three were the best of Las Vegas in terms of BBQ, guys listen closely.  ROLLIN SMOKE, BEST BBQ IN VEGAS!!!. . Location: Its funny when i tell people where this place is located since its in that desolate strip on highland near the Spearmint Rhino. Initially people are turned off, "you're taking me where?"  "Han take me back"  but once they have the food they go, "omg... Han pleaseeee take me back here". . Service: Service here is great.  They try their best to get the customers orders as fast as they can despite being busy during the peak hours of the day.  Another big plus about this place is that the chef will come out when he has time to ask his customers how the food is and a brief history of the restaurant.  Nothing like the person who makes the food to really care about what the customers think, bravo!. . Food:  You really can't find anything bad to choose from but i'd avoid the brisket (a bit dry when i had it last time i was here)  Their famous outlaw burger is literally the size of your head.... like a mondo burger (good burger reference).  So juicy and literally will leave you so full, you won't be able to eat till tomorrow.. . BBQ: BEEF RIBS!!! that is all.  Literally picked it up and the whole piece fell off.  St louis ribs are also very delicious and juicy.  Meat is so succulent and the juices that exude out of the meat is parallel to wringing a wet sponge.  I might just pass out from describing how good the ribs are.. . Overall. Just go here!
Was looking for a burger, found this. This is a new must go-to place every time I return to Vegas.  I wanted to keep eating and come back again but we were heading out of town.  So super yum I can't even explain it.  Odd little space, but not important once you taste the food!  Really wish they had a place in the San Diego area.
Flew in just about 11 and had a couple of hours to kill before heading off to Fort Irwin. Did the tourist thing by visiting the Pawn Stars shop, then Yelped someplace for lunch. Husband really goes for BBQ, and this place had 4.5 stars. Must say that 4.5 stars is perfect. (Wish Yelp allowed half stars.). . I had the club wrap, and husband had the pulled piggy sandwich and onion rings. The wrap and sandwich were great, but the onion rings were the best we've had anywhere. (Yes, I snitched some from husband.). . Ordering was easy, and food came in about 7 minutes after that. Staff was friendly. Yes, it's a hole in the wall, but SO much better than visiting a chain restaurant when we're traveling. The atmosphere was fun.. . Will definitely try it again when in Vegas.
After an extensive search for a BBQ place on here. I decided to go with Rolling Smoke. I was NOT disappointed. . This place is the shit. Straight up good BBQ. Great staff. A no frills setting with bench and park bench seating. Wasn't too hard to find either. The menu offered some great choices. . I went with the half rack baby back ribs, beans and cole slaw. Man the Kicken beans was kicken. So tasty. The cole slaw didn't appeal to me too much. My wife loved it. . The ribs were very tender and tasty. . Adding their BBQ sauce only made it better. We also ordered corn bread. Omg that was da bomb. Buttery and soft. I really can't say enough abt this place. My only regret is that I don't live in Vegas. But hey it's a great reason to come back.
Came for the famed Outlaw Burger. Hoped that it would remind me of some burgers from restaurants I grew up with which are now long lost. It didn't.. . Food was OK. Service was quite nice. In the end, probably won't be back.
Hmph. So I had quite a disappointing experience here, so I'm giving a lower star. . . Here's what I had:.   . Out law burger- 5 star.  Meat is juicy and flavor is so rich and yummy. Share one with someone. .  . The pit Special (4 meats and 3 sides for $20) - brisket, pulled pork, 2 spare ribs, and since the hot links were out i subbed it with baby back ribs for extra cost. .   Brisket was SOOOOOOOOO good. It was shredded up and looks just like the pulled pork to the point that my bf and I were trying to figure out which was which from our photo.  I didn't like the pulled pork (lacked flavor and was dry) and the spare ribs were okay. .   .  Sides:  Hush puppies (meh), Corn nuggests (THE DEALIO IS HERE), and kickin beans (yes!) . .  My bf thought this place was so legit, we went back 2 days later. I asked at the front where you order SHOWING the photo of my original Pit Special plate and asked him which meat was brisket and which one was pulled pork. We wanted to get it right, because one was substantially better tasting than the other. And, it was confusing, since they looked exactly the same shredded up together. He told me that the one that I had liked was brisket. . .  SO, I order the brisket.  What do I get?  Sliced meat. It didn't look like anything from the photo i had shown or what I had eaten 2 days prior.  Not only did it look different, but It wasn't as juicy and didn't have the same texture. .   I found out from the server that the brisket comes in two styles (shredded or sliced). It would have been nice for the guy that took the order to specify it for me if that's the case.  AND, I don't know how he can get it wrong after seeing a photo. . .   Not to mention, I ordered corn nuggets (cuz that's why i came back 2 days later) and when the server arrived at our table with our food, that was when I found out that they were out of corn nuggets. I had paid additional money for this side. So, I ask this guy how long it'll take to make them (because I was willing to wait for it) and the waiter told me "several days."   .   My friend went there 2 hours later, and told me there were plenty corn nuggets. WTH dude. I woulda seriously waited 2 hours for my corn nuggets. Or come back in 2 hours for it. But I was told several days, and I was leaving the next day. . .   When you're a vegas native and can access a restaurant any day, probably these things don't matter. But, when you're a visitor, a foodie, and you pick a restaurant out of all the choices available, it's disappointing when you don't get what you ordered. . .   Next time I go, I shall ask for SHREDDED BRISKET. It's SHREDDED BRISKET versus a BRISKET, y'all!
Wow! Wow! Wow!! The best, most authentic BBQ I have ever tasted! We went as a group of four and each of us ordered something different.  We wanted a variety of meats and sides.  The meats were so tender and delicious and bursting with a flavor.  They have a great selection of "sides" but the Mac-n-cheese was my favorite.  Not overly cheesy -- just perfect!  And then came dessert!  Absolutely amazing!  We tried the peach cobbler, berry cobbler and their famous banana pudding!  Oh my goodness! The banana pudding was the best I've ever tasted! Rollin Smoke BBQ takes the time to perfect ever aspect of their menu.  You will not be disappointed.  We can't wait to come back!
update 6/19 we have continued to visit and have seen the owners making changes to ensure everyone's satisfied. Back to perfect rating for my fave Q. Rolling smoke has been my favorite BBQ in town for over a year, love the brisket, giant beef ribs, and sides.  $24.99 all u can eat dine in special seems like good value. My issue is as it's gotten more popular the wait for ordering and food is tough, especially if I'm with my children. I don't see the owners in anymore and it's not as friendly. My last visit half my to go order was missing (after waiting over 30 min) and the employee made a joke that it was my fault because I initially didn't respond when my name was called (knew my order wasn't one bag).  I would have preferred apology for trying to send me on my way with half of a $40 order! Despite loving the food I'm hesitant to go unless during slow time
Omg so I went there yesterday and I can say it takes out famous daves the staff was so friendly including the owner one of the workers I forgot his name but he let us know how they started and everything it was nice that they take their time to talk to customers I loved the BBQ sauce and the damn hot sauce was really good too I walked out of there with 3 jars of BBQ and 1 of their Rub to bring back home .... When I'm in Vegas again this will have to be one of my spots to come to :)
My husband and I made a point of stopping here today while on vacation. It's only a few minutes from the strip (2 miles from the Monte Carlo) and is well worth the trip. We both went with the all-you-can-eat deal ($24.99, anything on the menu). I did two rounds: #1 - beef rib, BBQ nacho fries, baby back ribs, cheezy mac and cheese and bacon potato salad. The highlight was definitely the beef rib - juicy and meaty. Round #2 - smoked meatloaf and another baby back rib (no sides). My husband did three rounds - with the shrimp and hot links being his faves. This place is definitely worth getting off the strip for. You won't be sorry.
