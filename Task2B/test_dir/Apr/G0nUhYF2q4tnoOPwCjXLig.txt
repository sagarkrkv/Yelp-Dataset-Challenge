Friendly staff. Rooms need a little TLC though. Wall paper was peeling and table had sticky stuff on it. Beds seem comfortable enough.
Upgrayedd! . . Booked a discounted rate at $35/night and got upgraded to the more modern rooms with a view of the strip.  M-Life seems to pay off. Very nice and spacious rooms in tower 2. 45" plasma TV. Shower large enough for two. Can't complain about that. . . Not the best of the best hotels, but really really decent.  And for the price I paid for this, excellent!
This is a two-star hotel, so I'm giving it two stars to be accurate. But I'm also not thrilled with the Excalibur. So the rating can be explained either way. . . We're talking cheeeeeap rooms here, people. I paid $30 a night to stay here for a week; compared with NYNY across the street charging $190 on the same days. When I travel for work, I travel cheap. So this dumpy place works. But no way would I skimp and book this place for a vacation. If you're like me and enjoy luxe and glam accommodations with your travel, stay the hell away from here. . . Some irksome things: . . - no one at the valet when I rolled up around midnight on a week day. - no one wanted to help me lug my giant printer up to my room (liability reasons). - no one in general to take my luggage (so I had to make two trips). - two lights were out when I got to my room. - cord to the wired internet was broken. - my door wouldn't auto-lock on closure one night, so I had to slam it multiple times until it decided to wise up.... - ...this turned out to be a bad idea, because I got back to my room and it wouldn't open T_T. . But this whole review isn't one big downer. Any staff I actually encountered throughout Excalibur, for the most part, really amped up an otherwise lackluster stay. 99% of the people working here are all smiles, all service, all the time. It's nuts.. . - David, technician, just awesome. Great personality, super fast, knowledgeable at what he does. Doesn't come on up into your space and leave a mess.. - Angel, front desk, I actually like you. I know how it is to be exhausted and just wanna go home, and you know what, I'm glad that whole thing we had to deal with worked out.. - Everyone working at Dick's who would "compliment" my blue hair every day. You dudes are funny.. - People trying to get you to sign up for Mlife. How can you guys be so friggin friendly after hours of getting the shutdown??. - The security officer in Tower II who was such a gentleman! I'm sure watching a tiny woman carry an industrial sized printer around would worry any chivalrous heart, haha; but he was so courteous and helpful, I'm sad I don't remember his name!. . Alas, there are so many more names I can't recall. The first technician who came by to fix my internet. The guys working the valet at 1 am. The security who had to bust me into my room. I could go on and on. Bottom line, know that every one of these awesome blossoms keep the gears of Vegas well oiled and contributed to a work-stay that was far more enjoyable than it should have been. Peace.
Excalibur ar ett okej hotell pa Las Vegas huvudgata (strippen) som lampar sig for bade spelgalna turister som barnfamiljer. Hotellets utsida ser ut som vilket disneyslott som helst, men tyvarr var det inte lika charmigt pa insidan. I hotellet bodde det folk fran samhallets alla olika horn. I baren kunde det sitta nagon med fin kladsel och avnjuta en god drink medan nagra meter bort satt det nagon i mjukisbyxor som slosade bort pengar pa spelmaskinerna, men detta kanske sker overallt i Las Vegas. Inne i sjalva hotellet fanns det flera olika snabbmatsrestauranger och souvenirbutiker. Tyvarr saknades Wi-Fi, det fanns varken kostnadsfritt eller mot betalning.
Strayed here many times. The cost goes up and the amenities go down. Still a fun place but used to be better. Most dealers are not that friendly but they are the same in every casino now.
Shhh...what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.. . Was only here to donate $1 to a progressive slot with a $10 million jackpot and have dinner at Dick's Last Resort.. . Whoops, secret's out!
Before I went to Vegas for the Pac 12 tournament (March 2014) I read on Yelp about this place, saw the lukewarm reviews, then saw the rate, but decided to book it anyway since I didn't plan on being in my room much except for sleeping.  . . THIS PLACE IS FINE if all you're looking for is a comfortable room for a reasonable price.  The room was large, my view was right across from the roller coaster (NYNY), and the services were plenty okay for me.  I used the exercise room (free) and was VERY pleasantly surprised.  (I do a fair amount of business travel, and am accustomed to bad ones.)  The pool area was great actually, especially for morning coffee and a paper. (It crowds up during the daytime in warm months.)  . . Everything is expensive, so you have to find ways to cut costs, but I thought Excalibur is one really good way to do that.  I didn't experience the hawkers in the lobby, the loudness from the hallway, or any of the other complaints I read on here.  . . I would definitely stay again, and probably will again next year.
If you're looking for over-the-top, gaudy royalty, keep looking... you're better off in the middle of the desert in a pop-up camper with Sky Mall decor. It seems the entire budget of the resort and casino was blown on the front walkway.  You get allured into this grand castle.  But once you're through the gate, it's all down hill from there.  There are no knights to greet you.  No castellan.  No kings! Just the faint scent of menthol cigarettes and bowling alley cheese mixed with B.O./cheap perfume permeated throughout the castle.   I sure hope there's no feast or buffet here.. . I didn't step past the lobby, I was afraid I couldn't hold my breath long enough from the stench.  I presume the basement contained the 'casino' which consisted of a low-budget Chuckee Cheese arcade playing Rob Thomas on repeat (it would've been better if they threw in some hits from The Police or R.E.M).  Normally castles contain a grand hall.  The lobby was anticlimactic and not very king-like if you ask me.  I give this 1 star just for the outside.
On a trip with my girl friend, we canceled our reservations at the Quad and stayed here instead. With my Mlife card it averaged only $66 a night - Friday-Sunday. What a deal! . . When we arrived at Excalibur, we were lost as usual for the expansive casino/hotels in Vegas. But there was good signage that led us to the registrar desk.. . When we got there, the line wasn't too long, as it can be sometimes on the weekends. I asked at the Mlife counter if they could print me out another card, but with a rude demeanor, the staff member said they could print it for me when I check-in. So we waited in line, and got a really nice check-in clerk. I think his name was Ryan, or Brian? Anyway, he was great. Very nice, even got us a view of New York New York when he couldn't get a room with a view of Luxor like I requested. He printed out my Mlife card for me and entered my Southwest Rapid Rewards number so I could get points for the stay there too.. He gave us a room in Tower II, 17th floor, all the way in the back of the hall. That wasn't good for the nights we came up stumbling and too drunk to travel by feet very far. One night, my friend tried literally rolling on the ground to the room because she was having so much trouble. It was very comical.. . When we first arrived at our room, it seemed fine. It wasn't until I walked around without my shoes on that I realized there was a big wet spot next to one of the beds. Who knows what that could be. But we tried not to think too much of it and just wore our shoes in room. . . I also sought outlets for our phone chargers. I only found one on the lamp stand. So I moved the center table and removed the plug for the alarm clock, so we could both charge our phones. That was annoying.. . The bathroom was stocked with the usual amenities: lotion, shampoo, soap, and nice close-up mirror that's good for us women putting on makeup. And the lighting was way better than a lot of other hotels' lighting in their bathrooms. . . However on the last night we were there I came home craving a shower around 4/5 am. Unfortunately, the shower heat wouldn't go very high. So I was stuck taking a luke warm shower for what spanned about an hour (don't ask me why I wanted to take such a long shower). Finally, the heat came on and I had to turn it down to a more comfortable temperature. I stayed in for another 2 hours without complaint. Yeah yeah, I know that's forever. It's by far the longest shower I can remember ever taking. . . What I liked best about the room was the huge TV and the beautiful view. Everything else was ehhhh.. . When we checked out we had the hotel hold onto our bags for us while we go to a pool party before our flight. There was a gigantic line of people doing this, but when we eventually got up front the staff were nice and we had no issues getting our bags back later.. . Overall, I would stay at Excalibur again because of the price. But if I'm not on such a tight budget next time I'll definitely be staying somewhere else.
This was a nice hotel and great location.  We stayed in tower 1 and thought it was just fine.  Only had a shower, no tub, but not bad though.  Quieter than others we've stayed at.  Loved the show!  We would definitely stay here again!
I wish I could put 5 stars .. Because the begining of my vacation was great ... We checked in late Saturday ... We chose Excaibur because my boyfriend loved staying there .. I couldn't argue the price was great .. So upon checking in we get a upgrade from a room with a view to a room with a hot tub ..I was beyond excited .. We were suppose to check out Monday morning . But we were having such a good time we decided to stay an extra night .... I was even planning to return in sept for my birthday .. But then it went down hill . . Some how the door managed to lock itself with the dead lock while we were out .. Took us 30 min to get someone to open it .. I tried not to think about it ... Any ways your probably wondering why I'm so upset .. So on the morning of checking out  I was packing my make up and one rolled underneath the chair .. I  kneel down and  what do I find ?? The hugest fatest cock roach I've ever seen ..  I almost though it could have been a beetle by the size of it ... I was so disgusted ... This thing  was here with us the last 3 nights .. My great memorable vacation was ruined ... All I could think of how dirty this room really was .. There's no way they could have missed this bug if it was cleaned properly ... I felt gross knowing I stayed in that bed , used that hot tub .. I was furious. . . I went and notified management discreetly because i didn't want to call them out in front of other guests .. They apologized and offered to reimburse for one night that I stayed.... I didn't think that was enough But I bit my tounge ..  Now I'm driving home thinking about and although I do appreciate Excalibur for the reimbursement of one night .. I stayed for three days and still technically paid to sleep with a big dead bug ... I don't think I could come back and stay at this hotel
Our beds had bed bugs. My skin is very sensitive and  reacts very quickly to bites. I woke up with several bumps that look like mosquito bites on my face, back of my neck, arms and right shoulder. I pulled back the sheets and there were two small bugs crawling around. We took video,  packed our thingsand headed downstairs for a full refund. The hotel was professional about the situation, refunded the card and a security guard took down a report and snapped photos of my bites. I will not be returning to this hotel.
This is the cheapest place to stay on the strip, i dont consider circus circus or stratusphere the strip. It is alot of fun staying here.
When you play for 60 minutes at the craps table, you'd expect to get drink service at least once right?  Then you go to a bar and the bartender rolls his eyes when you ask for a bottle of water which he tries to charge you $4 for. Come on Excalibur... I'm freaking thirsty!  Three stars only because I've had great experiences in the past and also because of the $5 minimum on a Friday night.  Oh and pay for the upgraded room, you won't regret spending the extra $20 bucks.
Love this place, if you go get a new remodel room strip view its clean and nice, great pool and bar area, fun casino. lots of food choices to eat at and shops to go into. connects to mgm grand, new york, luxor and madalyan bay, really cool castle like hotel and has little mini markets, spa runs an early bird specail from 8 to 11 am check that out 70 for a 50 min message and you can use the spa sauna, steam room and hot tub and specail showers til 8 pm, if your looking for a hotel with great rates and beautiful and clean with really comfy beds stay here!!!!
I've been to the Excalibur many times on past Vegas trips and this time was no different from any other. The Excalibur is what I call the cheapest nice hotel on the Strip. The rooms aren't anything fancy, and if you're looking to spend the night dancing at some hip club you'll need to take a walk over to another hotel (which there are many nearby to choose from) but who stays in their room in Vegas much any way? They've got comfy beds, a shower, and a place to put my stuff and that is good enough for me.. . What keeps me coming back here time after time are the cheap prices and it's convenient location next to Luxor and New York New York. I love how they've got walkways to every nearby hotel/casino, because cabbing it everywhere can get expensive, and even a mini tram to take you to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. I discovered the tram does only operate during normal world hours though, not Vegas nightlife hours.. . The Excalibur is also home to a big food court, with Starbucks, McDonalds, Krispy Kreme, and Scholtzky's, to name a few of my favorites, they've got a little something for everyone who would rather spend their moolah on some gambling or drinks than a fancy dinner. Their famous restaurant down by the casino, Dick's, is fabulous fun! The bartenders and servers are famously rude and therefore hilarious, putting paper hats with cruel slogans on their customers and making fun as you down your booze.. . This hotel is also very kid friendly if you're taking the whole family, with their Fun Dungeon arcade and their King of Tournaments jousting show.. . The casino itself has the usual slew of tables and computer slots, along with a sports booking bar to bet on the upcoming games. I'm not a huge gambler but I do enjoy killing some time at the video poker games at the Sherwood Bar downstairs while knocking back some free watered down drinks.. . Come to the Excalibur to crash on the Strip, but if you're looking for posh settings and a nice club go elsewhere.
If you're looking for a cheap place to stay and one full of rowdy kids, stay here.  Rooms seem outdated to me.  But it is one of the cheapest hotels on the strip.  So, you pay for what you get.
