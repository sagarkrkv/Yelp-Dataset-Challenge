Best meal I ever had at a buffet. Comfortable. Great ribs and soups. Ask for chaiwat for server
Since we were staying at the Rio and everyone raaaves on about this place, we gave it a go.. . First impressions, massive! Like massive massive! There was soo much choice! . Often with buffets, some of the food can be sitting there for a while and end up being dry, but not this place!. . When we arrive the lady was replacing the chinese roast duck with a freshy. It was amazing good! On par with duck you get from hongkong!. . The ribeye, cooked to perfection!. . They also had a make your own noodle bar. Pho, udon, ramen, etc. The wife asked the chef to make her a bowl of plain Pho witb some greens. Half way through she found a friend in her soup... A lady beetle! Not happy.... . Called the manager over and they happily refunded her meal which was the least that they could do!. When you are such a reknowned buffet in Vegas, you would think that some more care would be put into preparing the food. . . But other than that, it was a good experience. And lots of choice.
One of the better LV buffets I've eaten at for a few reasons: 1) great service during champagne brunch -- unlimited mimosas! 2) reasonable price seeing as how many buffets can be upward of $40 per person. I would go here again.
I used to love coming here because they were so locals-oriented. It used to be 50% off locals, now it's 25% off with a rewards card. I haven't been here in probably two years, and this place has declined in all aspects! . . I like how they have a big selection of food; from Asian to Hispanic. But the flavor is bland and just dried out. The food has definitely been left out for awhile and not at all fresh. I like the desserts here. Their gelato is good but the pastries and cakes I don't really care for. . . Customer service is ok. Our server was quick with our drinks and providing more napkins, but a little slow with taking our plates away, which I understand since he had a lot of people in his section. But the hostesses at the front desk were completely rude and impatient with our party. She spoke down to us like we were stupid. As I've stated, we haven't been here in two years so we didn't know their new "policy." . . Don't know if I would come back after that experience. And definitely not worth every penny even with a discount.
Been going here for many years, and recently went back when visiting Vegas. Place hasn't really changed in ten years, and that's a good thing. Very reasonably priced, and I usually have breakfast here. Lunch is good to, but if you want high quality, gourmet food for dinner, I steer clear. But, as I said, it's very consistent here, and never really had anything bad at this buffet.
First time here was maybe about 7-8 years ago with my parents. After all those years I still enjoy this buffet. I don't eat meat so I was actually happy with the fish and other offerings they have available.. . If I was rating the desserts by itselfI would give a 5 star. The food is 3.5/4, not great but the dessert bar is the bomb dot com!. . If your going to avoid the higher priced buffets but still want to go to a buffet then come to the Carnival World Buffet! DO NOT  go to the other budget priced buffets, you'll regret it.
We eat here every time we come to Vegas, which is around twice a year! It's a good pick for our group because this buffet really does have a little bit of everything.. . The Good:. Large variety of food. Made to order stations for soups and tepanyaki. Great customer service. Amazing dessert bar!. . The bad:. It's pricey. We paid $33 a person this last time.. The line is always long.. . Is it the best buffet in Vegas? Maybe not, but it's pretty darn good for being off the Strip. We'll keep coming back.
This place was HUGE. I still can't get over it being $33 a person, but if you like to eat and eat A LOT this is the place to go! . . The food was average for a buffet. . . My only complaint was that it was SO huge and the way it was laid out made it seem like a ton of walking to get food. I never even made it all the way down to the end. It should be more of a circle rather than a wall of food.
love their seafood buffet such a wide variety of seafood they have some dishes with lobster and also crawfish and their crab seems to be always fresh .it is not dry like some buffets so you know it is fresh.they also have a good dessert bar with little red velvet cupcakes their creme brulee is always nice and creamy .they also have tiramisu  and gelato.
The food is pretty good we been there several times but not recently, we havent been in a while, I wonder if they still do the 2 for 1 with a players card on weekdays? Thats a pretty dang good deal!
The wait wasn't quite at the end of the winding ropes, but it was close and it took us about an hour to get through it, paid and to a table. It looks new and is designed well. There is a friendly staff to make your dining experience its best. The options in this buffet were immense. They have 11 separate buffet areas. I wish I had room to make my own stir fry, but I was too full from the 3 buffets I had within the 24 hours prior to this one to finish off my Buffet of Buffets. . I started with a salad because I had been eating too heavy lately. They had a multitude of green options (iceberg, romaine, spring mix and spinach), and a decent array of toppings and dressings. Everything looked fresh. I also had a cup of the chicken noodle soup, which was flavorful and hearty.. I had a plate of snow crab legs, and the server noticed quickly and brought me a tool to get into the legs with. They were cooked right and had a good flavor to them. Their lasagna was wonderful. It was the right amount of gooey cheese, a perfect amount of  sauce and a balanced amount of meat. Utterly delicious. . One of the only downsides to this restaurant is that nothing was labelled. You had to guess what everything was. Even if things are changing and rotating, there should still be a label.. The dessert bar had a large number of options for gelato/sorbets, and pies. I was too full for a pie (although, the cherry pie was calling my name), but I got the orange cream sherbert (I'm half guessing on the type of ice cream). It reminded me of the flavor of a Push-Up ice cream. Creamy and light, it was the perfect end to my meal.. . I would definitely recommend this restaurant to someone else. It was worth it to be a part of the Buffet of Buffets pass. I saw that this is $33 per person to enter without the pass. I would recommend the Bellagio over this one, if I were paying outright, but it's good for the deal.
Eek!!! Their selection was very disappointing for the price that we paid. The only decent food item served was their prime rib. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend going back anytime in the near future.
After my nightmare of eating at a Paris Buffet, I was relieved to find this buffet. A huge selection I enjoyed the noodle bar and fresh veggies. So many choices.
So many options, so little room on plate! So happy they had Asian noodle soups. Was everything we chose delicious? No, but there were so many great things that the couple so-so things didn't matter.
Back for the first time in almost 10 years.  Boy has the quality gone downhill.  Being a vegetarian, I remembered a lot of selections.  Not anymore.  Sure I was happy with their endless Del Taco-esq cheese quesadillas.  And sure sure their onion rings were pretty good.  But after that?  Steamed veggies CRAP.  Steak fries nowhere to be found, only thin ones that weren't good.  My carnivore hubby said they best part was the cookies.  When the cookies are the best thing at a buffet -- something is majorly WRONG.  My father felt sick all night after eating here.  I could understand why after looking at all the strange colored meat he was inhaling.   We paid $33 a pop for dinner.  I pay $7 or so a pop at Suncoast's 100% better buffet.  This place is past it's prime and totally needs Gordon Ramsey's help.
Just went over spring break and oh my god this has to be the best buffet I've ever had. Their chicken parm literally made me cry of how good it was. The gelato was amazing everything was amazing. I recommend.
We went to the buffet two nights in a row and there was no consistency between the two nights! One was a Saturday dinner and the other was a Sunday dinner! There were a lot of dishes they made Saturday that they didn't make on Sunday. Salad bar wasn't very extensive, lots of stuff was stale. Best part was the desserts and the carving station with the prime rib and pork roast! Both were delicious!! All in all lots of quantity and variety, lower quality! Still was good but I would make sure you go when it's busy so the food is constantly being changed out and not sitting! Price was okay! $33 per person. Kids 4 and under are free!
