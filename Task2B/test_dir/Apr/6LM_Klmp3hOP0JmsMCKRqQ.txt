For what it is, this is a good hotel. It is a much cheaper option than a lot of the other hotels. Sure you are a little further away from being in the middle of the action (like where the MGM would be) but really not by much and you ARE still on the strip. . . I stayed here for 3 nights, and paid $35 per night. You can't get much better than that. Of course you have the $20 per night resort fee but that is Vegas for you and you can't get away from that charge no matter what hotel you stay in. The room was nothing special, but it was very clean and that is all I expected for $35 a night. Beats spending $250 a night somewhere else. And I will say I met the nicest cleaning ladies (maids) here. . . There is still plenty to do in this hotel. You have shows like Criss Angel, Carrot Top, The Bodies Exhibit, Titanic Exhibit, you have some restaurants and bars inside the hotel with the casino gambling option as well. You have some decent smaller establishments to eat at: shout out to Backstage Deli. Try it! You won't be disappointed. And if you want more options you can take the walkway straight over to the Excalibur. . . I don't know what all the fussing is about with everyone saying "this is not as nice as the other hotels". Well duh, but you aren't paying nearly as much either.
Stayed at the beautiful, elegant Palazzo this weekend, checked out on Sunday. Hit the road just to discover traffic on I-15 S was extremely heavy and decided to turn around and stay one last night on the strip rather than sit in traffic all night long.. . Using my smart phone, I found the cheapest rate on the strip was at the Luxor. $42! Since all we really needed was a bed, we spun around and headed over. Valet parking was full(!) so we had to self-park in the difficult-to-find lot behind the casino. Walked a long distance into the casino with our bags only to discover a LONG, WINDING check in line.. . The line moved fairly quickly. Front desk attendant was polite and generously offered a free upgrade from the noisy Pyramid room to a basic room in Tower East. We gratefully accepted, being tired already and wanting a good night's sleep.. . Room was kitschy but clean. Pros: two wardrobes for hanging clothes; nice shower and tub; cute pyramid-shaped soap; $42 room fee! Cons: No WiFi in the rooms at all, not even for a fee; no chain lock or dead bolt on door. . . In a city where an average bar bill is $147, clean, neat accommodations for $42 is amazing.
Rooms are nice, hotel staff was also nice and friendly.  Spa was not the greatest but overall a great deal fro the price I paid.
Luxor could use some updating and better lights in the guest rooms, yes, but it still holds a special place in my heart.  . . I have visited the Luxor Casino and resort space a few times, and stayed in the hotel last year.  Upon arrival, the desk agent was beyond helpful, and even upgraded the room since it was my birthday.  The room was clean, and had a great view of the Excalibur and Paris, nice big comfy beds, and a large bathroom - all you really need in Vegas.  . . Their pool is awesome (although it always seems to get cold whenever I go there), and the ambiance is equally great.  Also, I got engaged here, so you know... special place in my heart :)
I don't know what everyone is complaining about. It's a good cheapish hotel that's on the strip. Parking is in the back of the pyramid. Stayed here on the weekend of March 28-30. Check in was at 3pm. Line was long but went away quickly. Our room wasn't too bad. We had 2 queens beds, good size HDTV, a cabinet with 4 shelves and an armoire. The armoire had a small digit locked safe that was complimentary for us to use. No mini fridge though surprisingly. We just used our ice bucket anyways. A/C unit keeps our room cool but not too cold even on the max which is good in my opinion since we left it on overnight. Bathroom was nice. Thing I have to complain about was the water pressure and the calcium buildup on the shower head. The room was clean and tidy throughout our stay. Bed was soft and comfortable. Noise level from the casino and bottom floor never reached our room (11th Floor). 2 elevator shafts opposite from one another with 4 elevators in each shaft. The walk to our room/to the elevator was tedious since an elevator shaft wasn't nearby. The pool was nice. Just flash your key card and you can get your friends in with you even if they don't have one. 2 pools were open. Both pools were 3 1/2 feet deep sadly. Our stay was uninterrupted and comfortable.
Stayed here only once but it was ok nice and big room in the pyramid and right above the casino...it was steel pretty quite didnt hear much of the casino noise which was a suprise.  This hotel is a bit in need of a remodel but still a goood hotel hopeing to cjheck out the pool next time we stay here. COupons come in handy here too. . . Not alot of food otpions but then agian there are tons on the strip and neighboring hotels.
For the price (comped for 4 nights...$35 a night to upgrade to a suite) it was fine. Rice and Co was horrible. Food was fair anywhere there. Small casino which worked for my friend who was recovering from foot surgery. Sheets were clean, bathroom floor was not (dark floor, I wiped with a wet, white towel...wish I stayed in denial). Ok check in process but this is only because we beat the crowd that was lined up by the time we got to the front of the line. Bell woman failed as she put first my computer back pack on the ground to prop open the door, which I then grabbed and said "This is my computer." She then took my friend's pillows and put those on the ground. (Yes, the tip shrunk as I grabbed the pillows and went "Really? Pillows on the ground?") The bellman early this morning was Great!!! Goes to show, just depends upon who you get. . . Would I come back? Sure, for the price but if I were willing to pay more (or gamble more to get better comps) I would stay somewhere else.
2 night stay in west tower was great!  Comfy bed and chairs, enjoyed the bath tub too.  Pool area excellent!  Staff very friendly.  Pyramid was dirty but enjoyed watching the amazing window cleaner repelling from the peak.  Well worth the stay for the money.  Tip - buy your booze across the street by Mcdonalds to save money.  We will return to luxor.
Very nice rooms for a good price; exceedingly nice and efficient front desk check-in staff; and conveniently interconnected to numerous other properties.  I could tell you that the check-in process, for a hotel with about 25 registration desks, was virtually flawless and lightning fast.  I could go on about how it's conveniently connected to Mandalay Bay's incredible and very long restaurant strip,  or how Luxor's Mexican restaurant up on their 2nd floor atrium is amazing in its cuisine and drink, which it most definitely was (Tacos & Tequila I think?).  . . However good all of the above was, I have but one comment left: I will NEVER stay at this iconic property again until you folks get wi-fi up in the rooms.  I repeat, NEVER.  Hello, it's 2014, in a world-class property, yet for me to get online, I have to get to THE LOBBY, via the long multiple labyrinths of hallways, elevators, more hallways, odd drunken people at every turn and elevator floor stop?  Um, no thank you.. . Fix the problem please, then maybe I'll come back.  What a shame, and I heard I'm about the thousandth person this month alone to complain about this problem. And still, the front desk personnel are nothing but empathetic and gracious.
This is an overall decent hotel/casino with some positives and negatives.. . Positives:. This hotel is probably one or the most affordable hotels on the main strip.  The rooms and suites are decent size. I still think it's pretty cool it is shaped like a pyramid, even if it is a bit outdated. The casino tables here are a bit cheaper then the other casinos. So you can find 10$ and 15$ black jack tables! The oasis pool is actually the biggest pool from any of the hotels and they always have a decent DJ by the pool side.. . Negatives:. Steer clear from the buffet and any of the eating places here, they all pretty much suck. If you are looking for two queen beds it's based on availability and they get taken quickly. I and one of my boys did not know that and got stuck with a king and a roll up bed. Another thing is it is very difficult to get sleep in this hotel, not sure what it is but maybe since they pump oxygen in the room.. . Another thing to remember is you are south of the strip, but you are only a 10 - 15$ ride to practically anywhere on the strip.
I was a little disappointed. My room kind of sucked and the hotel service was a little off. We had fun gambling here and there is a really fun bar to get the night started but all in all I don't plan in stating here again.
Nice enough, but rooms needs a renovation.  I can justify three stars, but not a four star.  Room we were in is a two room suite that apears to be missing some furniture and has a pretty old soaker tub in the corner.   Lobby is exciting and massive and location on strip is decent. We got a good deal on room, so overall worth price. I'd be upset if full price. Pools look nice, but haven't used them as of yet. Check in staff a little snippy and unhelpful.  Valet guy was very nice and helped us to self park.
my friend michele and i stayed in room #1031 from march 21st thru the 24th, 2014. the elevator ride was horrible! caution - to the disabled. the elevator was slanted we literally swung to the left or right ends of the elevator depending the side we got in. the room lighting was very dim. girls, if you plan on getting ready and doing your make up be aware that you will look like a clown walking out of your room not knowing how you did your make up in the dark. the bathroom light was not bright enough either. . . now, the best for last - the worst part of this room was the bed bugs. michele and i got bit up arms, legs, feet!! horrible, at first we thought we were allergic to something we took benedryl day 1, it continued each night and got worse along the days.  so we return from our anxiety/itchy trip and put in a complaint. first we call guest services they tell us to contact security as they are the ones that process the claims. security takes our report and says they will report it to their risk mgmt dept and would call us. its been two weeks no word from them so today michele and i called again and the security guy transfers us to the risk management and they told us that an inspection was done and there are no bed bugs!! we asked for a report and when it was done and how many ppl stayed after us and he suggested we send a subpoena for it. no proof no record! we want to know how many ppl slept in those beds after us, and who conducted the investigation. we are sending a subpoena. please do not stay at luxor!
Have stayed at the Luxor many times and it has always been great. It is a nice hotel, not super fancy like some but it is clean and they are always doing some type of renovation. The pool is really nice. The parking garage is convenient and free to use. They have really good restaurants on the property. The shows at the Luxor are some of the best.
Unbelievable. First, there is no wi fi in the rooms. They have a modem that you can connect to but for a Mac user that's not an option. . . The room I have is halfway down the hall but I can hear the elevator making all kinds of racket. The temperature controls are broken, not sure how this will play out overnight. . . I'm here for a conference at the Mandalay Bay and really wishing they weren't booked solid.
It was my first time ever in Vegas  and I was very excited once i saw the hotel . I thought it was absolutely beautiful, It didnt take us to terribly long to check in wich was nice. However we spend an entire hour trying to look for our hotel room. I would absolutely stay at this hotel again!!:-)
Very poor experience.  The room was cramped and the pyramid-shape means a low slanted ceiling. No wi-fi, just a modem!! And the receptionist was unhelpful, even though it was our anniversary.  Will never ever stay here or recommend it to anyone.
So, to add to my review, the cleanliness is seriously lacking. There was urine splashed on the inside of the toilet lid. I went to get my shoes from beside the bed and noticed 'items' left under the bed by other guests. . . I was awake much of the night due to the ridiculous noise of that elevator. . . If you're not going to offer in room wifi, at least have decent common area lounges for guests. . . I find it very telling that no one asked about my stay upon checking out.
I had to stay there three nights in a row as I was at a conference at Mandalay. Three of us stayed there and not one of us had ever stayed at a worse place. Suffice to say, this place is a DUMP. Rooms were dirty, wallpaper peeling, shower pan was plastic - like the worst motel you've ever been to. There is no excuse for this being an MGM property.
An older property and it shows.  . Ride the "inclinator" or elevator on an incline to your room.  I always liked the Egyptian theme with the obelisk inside the pyramid.
WORSE SERVICE EVER!!!! Incompetent workers who are rude & had us wait over three hours to check in. It's 6 am & all we want to do is sleep but we can't because the workers have no idea what they're doing. They tried charging me 75% more because they made a mistake & failed to take responsibility. They barely lifted a finger to help. We had to make calls to their customer service to get the problem fixed. Don't waste your time, energy, or money.
Wow, the Luxor needs and update in a series way! Not only is the layout of the hotel awkward, but the everything in the rooms is old.  . . To start off, there is one elevator entrance for the entire place which means you have to walk forever to get to, if your in one of the rooms caddy-corner... which we were. So forget about getting ice! . . Luckily we didn't spend too much time in the hotel or the room, so I can't say much except... if you get a good deal and don't mind staying in a hotel straight out of the 90's. This will meet your expectations.
Stayed for my bday..never again. The 800$ in so called savings coupons was a sham except for the free dinner. No real accomidations either, no fridge in room, no microwave and the elevators are a dam nightmare! Oh and about every 2 hours random hotel guests come knocking on your door looking for weed..."not my room stoner try the rappers next door"!, the convenient stores rapes you for basic needs like 5.50$ for a 2 liter of soda or 15$ for a half pint of well booze. Anything affordable is a mile and a half walk thru aholes and catwalks(walgreens/CVS). So take walking shoes and not heels ladies. Cheers!
I had to go to Vegas for an entire week for an IT conference, and this was the hotel that gave a discounted rate for staying there during the conference.  I work for the government, so we are basically required to take the "deal rate".  Anyway, I waited in line for about 30 minutes to even get checked in, and then the woman claimed my hotel stay was not "paid for up front", and that I needed to pay for it.  I provided a copy of the receipt and authorization showing it was paid for, but she still showed in the system it wasn't.  I told her, "How could I have a credit card authorization and a confirmation from this hotel showing it is paid for, if it hasn't been??"  She then went to talk to a manager...and came back over 20 minutes later.  I didn't get a "sorry" or "thanks for waiting", she just gave me my room key without saying anything.  . . My room was supposed to be non-smoking, but when I opened the door the smell of smoke was overwhelming!  The entire room smelled of smoke, including the bedding.  I realize all of Vegas is somewhat smoky since it's legal there to smoke in the casinos, but the sheets shouldn't smell like it if they wash them.  Yuck!. . Anyway, just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I went to use the restroom and there were 3-4 pubic hairs stuck on the edge of the sink.  Blah!  . . Maybe it's time for better front desk service and a better cleaning staff..
I've stayed here twice and have had a great experience both times. Yes, it's outdated. It's a very old casino, but they could definitely revamp the place. The beds here are my favorite -nice and cushiony. The walls aren't too thin so I've rarely heard my neighbors. It's one if the cheapest places on the strip yet it's only an $11 cab rude to the north end if the strip. It's connected to Mandalay Bay which I love! So many restaurants and sights to be seen. We ate at a ton of places so my recommendations: . Rice and company (Japanese cuisine) and T&Ts (Mexican cuisine). Both are a little pricey but they are worth it!. . I want to give a shout out to Alicia at the front desk. There was a very long check-in line and some guests were just brutal to the employees. Alicia was calm and collected and so sweet to us. She even upgraded me to a better room and a great area. Thanks Alicia!! You made our stay even better!
We stayed for two nights. All things considered it's a good deal if you get your room for less than $60...because it's a great and original place (if you stay in an pyramids room). However, the loud music in the pool area is really annoying as well that the hotel charges an extra resort fee of $20 each day (which hasn't been displayed before.)
The short version: So far, the Luxor hotel is my favorite Las Vegas resort. . Splurge on a upgraded tower deluxe room. It is worth the additional fee as the rooms are newly renovated and beautiful with very comfortable beds, floor to ceiling windows (I had a view if the Oasis swimming pool), huge soaking tub and separate shower. It feels very Lux. The spa was also reasonably priced.. . The pool was family friendly, all ages were welcome. They did serve adult drinks though andmusic blared over the speakers, the overall vibe was very low key, they weren't catering to the party crowd while I was there which made it relaxing and a nice break from the craziness of the strip. Be prewarned though there is no shaded areas unless you reserve a cabana, I believe they are $100 for the afternoon. . . I am not much of a gambler, so I can't really speak to the games but there appeared to be many different slot matchines, not many tables. The casino lacked pesty time share sharks so that was refreshing as nobody likes to be harassed within their own hotel.. . Luxor also has many great food options, and if you book your hotel on Vegas.com you will likely get a cupon book with great deals to just about all of them including their steak house, and my personal favorite Blizz frozen yogurt!
Great budget hotel! Very clean hotel on the strip that is pet-free and has non-smoking rooms, which is great for those of us with allergies.
Stayed here for the opening weekend of March Madness this year. We stayed in the "Tower Deluxe" room. There were 3 guys in a 2 queen room with a rollaway. Our total for Wed-Sat 3 night stay was around $580 all in (after taxes and resort fees). So for under $200 a guy it was quite comfortable and less then we would have paid at other properties at the peak time of the NCAA tournament.. . The Good:. -Nice bathroom that seemed relatively new. -Good maid service, who did a great job cleaning up a room with 3 guys in it. -In room safe was necessary to have and it worked well (fit my laptop). -"Wired" internet. For some with tabletsthey didn't have internet, but two of us had laptops with the plugin so it worked quite well. The ethernet cord can literally stretch across the room. It's probably 50 ft long. While a minus for some on reviews, I actually liked the internet being wired. Strong signal that worked well.. -Spa access for $15/day was great. Nice smaller spa that had everything you wanted at it, including all the water/juice/fruit you could eat. That alone paid for itself (bottled water is $3 on property and its pretty small).. -Across Las Vegas Boulevard was a Chase ATM and very cheap beer at a gas station. That was nice to have when walking down the strip.. . The Bad:. -Staying in the Tower the elevators were away from everything. It was confusing when first getting my room key as to how the hell to get to my room. While it was nice to be away from the casino floor (unlike the pyramid rooms), it just seemed a little far away.. -Friends that were staying mid-strip were either a 20 min walk away, or a $15 cab ride. The location is what it is, but if you plan on meeting others in the middle to north part of the strip then its simply not the place for you.. -The casino is outdated as everyone else mentions in their review. It's a catch 22 for MGM. Do they pour money into a place that was built during "old vegas"? Or do they focus their efforts toward the middle-north part of the strip where the future is. The good news is Mandalay Bay next door is very nice and connected to the hotel, only about a 5 min walk away from the Luxor casino floor.. . Overall I would recommend staying here if the price is right and you are comfortable being away from the action at the very south end of the strip.
So, it was not my decision to stay at the Luxor. I went with a group of people and lost the vote on hotel options. With that in mind, let's get down to business.. . 1) This hotel needs serious room updates in the pyramid rooms. New furniture, new wallpaper, new paint, new everything. The sheet and blankets were paper thin. I get that we're in a desert, but come on. Also, the lighting, or lack thereof, sucked. No good makeup light.. . 2) The main cabinet smelled. "I didn't even wear these clothes, but I'm going to have to wash everything that was in this cabinet to get the smell out." -My husband. . 3) We didn't get a code for the room internet, therefore, we basically had no internet. We couldn't get 3G/4G access in the room. Only option was to go downstairs to the lobby/casino for wireless. Still awful connections.. . 4) MOLD! Yay! Saw it on the shower walls. Almost hard to detect since the shower tiles were an ugly shade of brown, but oh, it's there.. . 5) Tiniest blow dryer, ever. Glad I brought my own.. . 6) Dirty windows! I'm sure windows at the pyramid are a bitch to clean, but hey, if you decide to build slanty walls and have slanty windows, you need to figure out a best practice to keep them clean.. . 7) Location! Location! Location....was the WORST. You basically have to walk through the Excalibur to leave the building. If you've been through the Excalibur, you know that's also a dump. Even when you escape the Excalibur, you're still far away from everything. We had to take a few cabs. I do enjoy walking to strip every now and then, but sometimes it can be a huge pain.. . 8) So many "interesting" people. Great for people watching, bad for everything else.. . 9) Asked for extra towels and pillows. Waited for awhile, but had to leave. Not sure if they ever came to the room.. . I can't speak for the pool area cause I never got to use it. I took a quick peek and it looked like a large space, but the lounge chairs definitely needed a power wash. The food was pretty good, but it's Vegas, so it's overpriced. We ate at the Cafe (understaffed and slow on a Sunday morning), the pub bar, and the Mexican restaurant (everyone seemed to enjoy their meals and drinks there). Besides all that, the casino was fine. Nothing special.. . Look, my husband and I only paid $176 for 4 days/3 nights (we shared a room with friends). So it's not like it was expensive. Just, don't be fooled by the decor. The Luxor looks cool from the outside, but it's something else on the inside.
For sure i will be coming back to this hotel i enjoyed my stay here, i love the fact that it was a separate shower and bath huge mirror as well as a blow dryer, a lot of closet space and drawers to hand and fold your clothes. the only reason i am not giving  5 stars is because we asked for a king size bed and we got to queen size instead. .as well as the view was the top of the building, the windows did not open and it was very stuffy to breath.
Resort fee 20.99 per night . For wired internet access really ? Who uses wired internet this days . This is ridiculous . But pretty much all hotel do the same thing charge a resort fee for not having  nothing . It doesn't even includes access to the spa . On top of the $21 you have to pay $15 to use the spa . I stood at the Cesar before and their spa is fabulous and I only paid $10 at the Rio no charge . This is ridiculous I say
This was my first visit to Las Vegas, and I thought the Luxor was nice, but not perfect. First, the good: staff was helpful, my room in the tower was quiet and comfortable. The only time I heard my neighbor was when they rolled in at 2:00 am and decided to hold a loud debate in the hallway. Probably fuelled by alcohol. I liked how the Luxor was connected by walkways to other casinos such as the Excalibur, which made getting around easier. For the most part, the hotel was clean and well maintained. I didn't see any obvious signs of neglect such as burned-out light bulbs. They do have some very interesting displays all over the place, and everything looks nice.. . Now for the bad: my number one complaint was the prices of everything. I forgot my sunblock and the Luxor's shop wanted $17! For a little 3 ounce bottle of sunblock! I went to the gas station across the street and got one for "only" $7.99. Food there is ridiculously high priced. The good old days of cheap buffets in casinos are apparently gone for good. At the Luxor, dinner buffet was $22.99 (before tax) for one adult when I was there.  To be fair, it's like this in every casino, not just the Luxor. If you want reasonably priced food, your options are to walk a little down the street and get fruit and vegetables at the pharmacies, or find a junk food place like McDonald's or Pizza Hut. There are no refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms at the Luxor. Also, there is no laundry area, so if you are staying several days, you have to either haul dirty clothes back home with you, or travel around Las Vegas looking for a laundromat.. . Bottom line: the hotel is nice, relatively cheap to get into, it has a great location, it's comfortable and it looks very interesting inside and out. The problem is, once you're there, you'll find that everything you need, from food to sunblock to the mandatory resort fee is ridiculously high priced. I never noticed any odors or mold in my room, unlike what some other reviewers have posted. My room was very clean, I had no problems there. The only problem is that they also cleaned out my wallet with the prices of the add-ons.
Over priced, far away from everything, you have to connect through the internet on a wire through the wall.
The Luxor is a dump.  Outdated room.  Resort fee of $20 a day.  No wireless in the rooms.  The bed and pillows were uncomfortable.  There was an unpleasant smell in portions of the hotel.  i would never stay here again.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the lady who checked me in.  She was great.  Friendly and helpful.  This place may be ok if you are with a bunch of lads for a weekend and all you need is a place to crash a couple of hours a day but for anyone with a family, travelling for business or over the agre of 30, its rubbish.
This is my third time in Las Vegas and I choose the Luxor to stay at because it looked fun and enticing. At check-in we paid a 20 dollar a day resort fee, it wasn't a problem until we realized that you don't get much for the fee. On my last two stays I stayed at the tropicana and should have stayed there on this stay. The Luxor hotel is run down and not taking care of. The windows in our room were dirty through out our stay. The resort fee included wired internet services really I didn't know that still existed. The wi-if they offered was only for 48 hours and only worked in certain parts of the hotel. The towels were hard and cheap. The only good thing about our room was the bed and the pillows. On our first night here we decided to eat at the MORE buffet BIG disappointment. The  food was the same for lunch and dinner and it wasn't a  wide variety of selections. The next time I come to Vegas I will stick with what I know and stay at the tropicana. Very very disappointed....
8:15 am. Friday the 25th of may. U wake up after just going to bed at 6am.  Your girl... You and yes a third party. But wait its not one of them hot girls u see walking thru vegas wearing tight skirts they squeezed so into they can hardly breathe. It's Connie the cockroach. Yes I read it on yelp and now I've seen it myself. Coincidence?bed bugs? Who knows , but I itch!! It's probably all in my head. I tried to take a pic of her but Connie ran for the hills. She was a petite one so she scrambled fast. This place use to be really cool , now it seems it's slacking. Pay the extra money. Go somewhere else. I mean after seeing Connie I wanna go home. I'll be here til Sunday. Grandma please take me home.
You can't feel the elevators moving sidewards when inebriated!. . However, when you're sober, its trippy because you feel the elevators move up and side.  Oh and their beds and pillows are AMAZEBALLS!!!! No matter how late in the night, or afternoon ... I would just lay on the bed and sleep like a baby. I wouldn't wake up with no cramps either.. especially with me laying down in awkward positions due to a late night of drinking. I would wake up refreshed and ready to party again!  I took the pillow cases off and got the name of the pillow and ordered some when I got back home....Sobel Westex Sahara Nights if you're interested.. . The staff were always helpful and friendly.  I walked around the hotel by myself mostly.... and there was always someone to help you. Except................for those irritating ones that try to get you to buy a timeshare. I LOVE messing with them!  They like to stop you and ask, "are you planning on coming back next year?"  That's when I respond, "heck no! I hate this place!" hahaahhaha No, I really did enjoy my stay at the Luxor.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay on the strip.  It's a bit away from the crowded part of the strip, but still close enough to walk to.  If I won, I'd probably would have put 5 stars hahaha j/k  I put 4 stars instead of 5 because this is more of a casual resort type..... not as fancy as the other ones.. but I LOVE LOVE LOVE their beds and pillows!!!
Maybe I'm easily impressed, but after 20+ years and 15+ visits to Vegas, I'm still impressed by the pyramid hotel/casino with the huge, hollow interior.. . Nothing else about this place really stands out. But, FFS, it's a giant pyramid made of glass and steel in the middle of the Mojave Desert. What else do you want? Dancing T-Rex's inside?
Imagine a huge pyramid with no working toilet. This is the case with Luxor.. . Luxor is slowly falling apart from the inside and has the worst infrastructure I have seen in years. . . This was my first trip to Las Vegas and with Las Vegas hotels. I got a fantastic deal from Expedia from Saturday night at December 28, 2013 to Monday Dec 30, 2013 for 2 nights. I have never visited Las Vegas so I was just going by the reviews and hoping for the best. Very Disappointed.. . Here are the things a normal 2 star hotel like, say, Comfort Inn has over overpriced Luxor.. . Free Wifi . Free Breakfast. Clean Bathrooms - we found hair and condoms on the floor...really..... Proper Outlets - The plugs keep falling out of the outlets. We could not charge the iPhones because their outlet system was ancient and we literally could not plug in the chargers since the connection was too loose. We had only one proper outlet and for the others, we had to literally HOLD the charger close to the port. Can you imagine a Comfort Inn without a proper outlet?. Proper Wired Internet -  Our Wired Internet (for which we paid our resort fee)  did not work because of the room's ancient infrastructure. The man from the front office who had to fix this issue just peace'd out on us because it was late. We spent over 3 hours with his man. 3 hours we could have spent exploring Las Vegas.. . The food for which we were given discounts for was overpriced.. . Our Last Day in Vegas, we shifted to a 2 star hotel. It was nothing much but it had all these things and it was much more satisfying. . . Recommendation: Don't. A star exterior with a D star interior.
So I just sat at slot machine for one hour, trying to get a drink after putting in 200 dollars, that never happened.  Then I went to one of the bars and watched two three bar tenders talk to one another telling stories, looked at me several times. I asked for a drink and was told that it would cost me 13.00 for a Jack an Coke. I asked them how one could get a drink on the floor and figured that the two hundred I had just spent warranted a drink. There answer to me was, " The drink ladies don't work at their bar. Wow, that is really great customer service. Yesterday I wanted to rent a Cabana,but I wanted to make sure that we had food for the day. The staff said that the snack bar would be open at 11 a.m., but not to worry as I'd have my own server. I was told I'd have to be there by 0900 or i would lose the Cabana, so i promptly arrived as told. I went to the Cabana and around 1000 I was hungry and wanted to eat. The waitress came by and told me that no food would be served until 11:00 a.m. Let me also say that there was also a sign at the entry that stated "No food or drink from the outside was allowed". I bit my lip until the following occurred. Finally 11:00 arrived, I ordered two sandwiches for my GF and myself. Twenty five minutes later the food server came back to tell us that the snack bar had no meat, lettuce, tomatoes. She was so embarrassed to tell me this information. I told her that I wanted to speak to a manager, twenty minutes later a manager arrived and I told her all of my complaints and concerns. Her answer to my concerns was she would comp my lunch. I told her that I could care less about my lunch being comped, I was hoping to hear that she would take care of the problem........I could go on and on about the Luxor. The employees or the one's that i met only cared about one thing, that they had a job and got paid on payday.  This is my first and last time at the Luxor and hope that others will read this.
The pyramid rooms are pretty cool, if you like the sloped ceiling. What I like are the elevators going up to those rooms as they go up on a slant.  I like that it's also connected to Mandalay Bay.  The shops that are in between the two hotels are pretty cool and you can find some decent food there.. . Rooms themselves were just OK. Nothing special.
