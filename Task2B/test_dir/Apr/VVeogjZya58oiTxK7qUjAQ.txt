Excellent gourmet pizza.  Long wait to get seated but well worth it.  Weekday lunch time usually has a shorter wait.
Was told about this place from someone on the plane to Phoenix... Spot on! Great Pizza, wonderful flavors! Has the Wiseguy with some wood roasted mushrooms.
What is there to say? The hype is real, pizza is fantastic, ingredients are fresh and it shows in the finished product. I was fortunate enough to enjoy the food without the horrid waiting time that is usually the norm at this establishment.
This place is sooooooo good!  And it shows because you have to get there early if you dont want to wait 2 hrs for a table.  Luckily they have a really nice wine bar next door that you can wait in.
* italian pizza with fresh ingredients and perfect crust *. . (FUN FACT: back when pizzeria bianco was brand, spanking new...it was called 'the italian restaurant'.  searching for it didn't yield the results desired, so they renamed the restaurant 'pizzeria bianco'). . I MADE IT!!!  after reading all the reviews about how long the wait was, i didn't know if i was going to be able to eat at pizzeria bianco on a short weekend trip. we were walking around downtown phoenix in the heat. it was uncomfortable...and only the end of march. we were going to pass by to see if it was possible to eat there.... . it's near ASU in an area with cute little brick buildings. NO LINE!!. . SCORE.. . okay, we're eating here. it's LINNER -- lunch dinner circa 2:30pm. nick bianco, himself,  was at the restaurant at the time. he's personable and friendly. . . complimentary bread that was soft and chewy on the inside with a crunchy crust served with EVOO. we ordered the tomato, mozzarella, basil salad. the flavors and textures were ultra delicious. the curds are from wisconsin, but they stretch it out themselves to make the mozzarella. tomatoes were ripe and sweet. they go local with whatever they can. the flour is made in arizona.. . we opted for a pizza that was half margherita and half rosa.  now for the taste test of the long awaited pizza. WOW!!!  fresh ingredients in the correct amount put together with the  MOST AMAZING CRUST. . . loved the margherita!!  the rosa was very unique as it had no sauce just great ingredients of chopped pistachios, onions, etc. . . I WAS IN PIZZA HEAVEN.. . for comparison's sake since we are from socal.  we did have pizzeria mozza before.  well, pizzeria bianco is many times better than that. but don't take my word for it, try it yourself.. . TIP: . 1) the reason why there is a line most of the time is because the restaurant is small. people who know better come in 2s. 2 or 4, no more.. 2) if you don't want to go to the original location, there is another pizzeria bianco...also pane bianco serves the pizza also.
Wow is all that I have to say!!
i would not even give a single star given an option. Its super highly overrated restaurant in my opinion. one can buy better tasting & cheaper pizza from Dominos, papa jones, little ceaers..........etc. The margarita was still ok but pistachio was ******* crap. I still cant believe they have 45 mins waiting. Even after ordering you have to wait till eternity. Menu has like 5 choices, I understand its a speciality restaurant but then every item has to be super. Sorry big disappointment. Wanted to go there since long but would never ever go there again. I dont recommend it at all.
How can someone from Philly even consider eating pizza in Arizona? Well, it was easy since Pizzeria Bianco has such renown. We went almost as soon as it opened on a weekday & got the last indoor table. Within minutes there was a line outside.. . The interior is charming but small. We thought the service was great & ordered ice teas before figuring out our pizza choices. I was surprised that they only serve sugar...no sweeteners, but that was ok. During our 45 minutes in the place, they refilled water and teas repeatedly. Next came absolutely delicious bread and very very potent olive oil. Yummy!. . We ordered one 1/2 margherita/sausage and 1/2 pistachio red onion and parm. The other pizza was a plain margherita. The oven is so hot that they came in no time & were they ever delicious! The pistachio was very odd, but very compelling. The Italian sausage was the best I've ever eaten...so flavorful! We loved every bite. The crust was delicious as was the sauce on the margheritas.. . Best pizza in America? I think that is just too subjective. Certainly one of the best. Don't miss a chance to go to Pizzeria Bianco!
Who doesn't love Pizzeria Bianco? Great restaurant...awesome food. The only downside is the wait...but they have a cute wine bar next door to wait until your table is ready. So the wait isn't THAT bad :)
Went here Friday night for dinner while traveling on business. Since I was alone I sat at the bar and Dave helped me out. I started with a greens salad and the red wine vinegarette was refreshing but had a little kick, it was perfect. I can never make up my mind, so I was between the margherita and biancoverde pizzas and he suggested I get a half and half ... Great call because they were both fab! I would definitely come back for both. I enjoyed a nice glass of white wine and topped off my meal wIth some chocolate gelato. Not only was the food great, but the service was too!
What trip to Phoenix would be complete without a visit to the famed Pizzeria Bianco, which has been arguably called the best pizza restaurant in the country by more than one publication.. . Located in Heritage Square, and next to the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco is a very small restaurant.  When the popularity started to mount, wait times could exceed four hours.  Although the fanfare has seemed to die down somewhat from a national standpoint, Pizzeria Bianco still attracts crowds.. . In order to avoid any potential long wait in the 110+ degree weather, we got there early enough to beat the crowds and were seated immediately.. . The meal started off with some nice crusty bread that was super soft on the inside along with some nice fruity olive oil.. . The handmade mozzarella, tomato, basil and extra virgin olive oil salad is a take on the margherita without the bread.  The mozzarella is super fresh, the tomatoes were a little lacking in flavor and the basil added a nice herbal punch.  A classic salad with few ingredients could have been elevated with riper tomatoes and just a touch of salt.. . The pizzas are cooked in the wood burning oven that dominates the kitchen and is the focal point of the restaurant.. . The "Wiseguy" pizza includes roasted onions, mozzarella and fennel sausage.  This is a nicely balanced pizza as the roasted onions brings out the sugar in them to cut the sharpness of the fennel.. .  The "Biancoverde" pizza includes fresh mozzarella, Parmegiano reggiano, ricotta and arugula.  We added anchovies to this pizza.  The pepperiness of thearugula cuts through the richness of the cheeses.  I personally did not like this pizza, especially with the addition of the anchovies, but my dining companions loved this pizza, and was their favorite.. . The "Sonny Boy" pizza includes tomato sauce, mozzarella, salami and Gaeta olives.  The saltiness of the olives totally overwhelms the rest of the ingredients.  If they were cut into smaller pieces, perhaps this would work better.  After taking the olives off, this became a much better pizza and each ingredient was able to shine on its own.. . The classic "Margherita" pizza includes tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil.  We added wood roasted organic mushroom and prosciutto.  On its own, the Margherita pizza is fantastic, but the addition of the mushrooms added a nice earthy flavor while the prosciutto added just a hint of salt.. . Is this the best pizza in the country?  That can be argued forever and never answered, as food is subjective.  I do applaud the freshness of the ingredients, and that everything is hand crafted.. . Worth a visit when in Phoenix?  Yes.  Worth waiting four hours?  I personally wouldn't.
We, work family, and I visit Pizzeria Bianco once a year at Christmas time, and it is as good as everyone says. Before I can finish saying Pizzeria Bianco, my mouth starts to water.
Very disappointed after reading the great reviews!  Pizza had no flavor at all!!!  I would much rather spend the money at La Piazza in Glendale and now in  Downtown Phoenix!!
Just keep ordering different pies and shut up. Just stuff your face and be happy that you are alive to eat this marvelous pizza! I'm originally from NYC and I know my pizza - and this place is the real deal. Order. Keep ordering. Keep eating. And keep eating some more!! Amazing!!
It was good, but I do feel like it was way over hyped.  I think part of my hangup is that I really just prefer a slice of NY Style Pizza.  Service was good and the varity of pizza was also good.
Nice location but don't know what the hype is about.  The pizza was way too fancy, thin and not fulfilling.  It did not taste bad but it was just not the pizza you imagine.  The salad was a few leafy greens in a bowl.  Definitely not a salad and would not order it again.  But, the location is great and they have a nice outdoor area (when the weather is nice).  I went in the middle of the day so there was no wait. I believe if you go in the evening on the weekend the wait could be over an hour.
Hey Yall....i honestly feel that these folks are going to run me out of AZ for my honesty...but oh well. I AM BEGINNING TO THINK WHEN I TAKE A PICTURE OF AN EATERY B4 I EAT I JINX MYSELF...Lets do a rating scale 1 to 5...1 = LOWEST 5 = HIGHEST CUSTOMER SERVICE 1AMBINCE 2 FOOD 1...This was by far the worst pizza experience ever...The bartender/server was rude...He offered free samples to the couple next to me, provided plates, and condiments...for me nothing...Never asked me if I wanted a plate...I mean do I look like a savage to not need a plate...ummmm is it okay if I order a drink....finally received my ginger ale nothing special but name not good very bitter and I am quite fond of ginger root...read bottle LOW SUGAR...yucky...back to the pizza BURNT at the BOTTOM....SAUCE NO FLAVOR....OLIVES was the BEST THING olives really AP...yep olives...oh yeah by the way I ordered the sonny boy...HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT or MAYBE THEY JUST DIDN'T LIKE ME....shrugs and hands leftovers to a homeless guy...hope I didn't piss him off :-(
This is great and I would give it 5 stars, but that is reserved for a pizza I grew up on back in Illinois.  Sorry, Pizzeria Bianco.  I admit that Pizzeria Bianco  is the best I have had in Arizona.  It does beat oreganos and grimaldi's.  Anyone who loves this pizza, but does not want to wait the 2 hours can go to La Piazza Al Forno in Glendale for authentic Napoletana pizza.  Yes I am a pizza fanatic.
The tales of deliciousness sing on their own accord for toppinged bread such as this. The Rosa: Artisnally thin slicings of sweet red onion, Parmigiano Reggiano of aged composure, Rosemary to add a bursting pop to your senses, and  AZ Pistachios for a glorious finish. What is this alien breed of pizza thing? Magic. . . Though limited, the beer selection was tasty and the Nut Brown would go well with any  of these brick-toasted crusts.. . The salads? For the Caprese of home made mozzarella was fabulous, the cheese salty but not offensive, the tomatoes ripe and complimentary. And the Farmers Market salad, though perhaps heavy on the white balsamic, a tossing of delight with a citizenry of flavors (gorgonzola, red onion and bread crumbs atop the delicious bite of escarole. . . Dear bellies, I speak to you. Heed the song and words of our dear savior of Yum, bringer of dinnertime satisfactions, bestower of joyous consumation. . . Eat here, be here, dine... at Pizzeria Bianco. . . For me, its worth an hour - 1.5 hour if you're occupied with pre-dinner drinks. and you're looking for a place with great service, great food, and a good atmosphere.
What a charming location!  . Went in the evening when the place was alit with glowing orange hued lights.  It is on a campus along with a couple of other restaurants Nobou and Rose & Crown making it a quiet place to dine outdoors.. Pizza was outstanding.  I had an organic greens salad and Margarita Pizza with olives.  . The services was extremely friendly as well.
This has to be my favorite pizza place in the state of Arizona, or to clarify it is the best pizza place I have ever been to anywhere.  Great service and atmosphere.
Visited based on all raving reviews, and because the owner is supposed to be from phill (where we work) with several friends on our escape weekend. Had a borderline unreasonably long wait time as reservations are not accepted, however they sent us next door to a wine/beer and cheese bar type place, so that killed time pretty well.  My one friend ordered a basic white, and they were out. Not a good sign. We got seated, outside, which is lovely, and the table is so uneven my beer falls over. That sucked but I wasn't a fan of it anyways (nut brown ale, which I usually like, but I'm not faulting anyone for my tastebud preference). The selection of pizzas consist of 3 red sauce and 3 white, that's it. Ok. I can deal with that, because at the bottom of the menu  also has a selection of "additions." I figure I can make my masterpiece. I try to request the addition of a red sauce to the white pizza and you would have thought I was asking the server to kill her first born child. No exception was made. I wanted to have a side of sauce and the explanation was "the chef policy."  Forgive me, but who on earth can dictate what I think will taste better?  I offered to pay for the added sauce but still, no dice. I went ahead and ordered, and got a pizza that was absolutely covered in onions (which, were good in a much smaller quantity, but I guess I'm crazy if I prefer pizza w onions vs onions w pizza. ) The rest of the table tried 4 other types of pizza, none of them were finished. We were all very disappointed.  We are not going to recommend nor return.
Thought and expected it to be better. Just average pizza ;(
Can't argue that I have ever had a better pizza!You must give it a try.
I am actually not even sure why Yelp asked me to review Pizzeria Bianco when I logged in but since I have been there numerous times and I really love this place I decided to go ahead.  I make my own pizza most of the time and everyone raves about how good it is but as far as I am concerned this is the BEST pizza in all of Arizona.  The crust is light and crispy, the toppings are fresh and flavorful and above all interesting.  I read an article in the Arizona Republic about how the vendors at the farmers market save their best for Chris Bianco (who last I knew personally shopped for the ingredients every day) because they like him so much and respect him.  I totally believe that.  I don't like the wait when you got there during busy time but I have to respect that he keeps the place small and the quality high.
Such a legit pie - they now have some outdoor seating so the lines are as bad!  All good things take time!
It's pretty hard to find a better wood fired pizza, it's the little things that set Pizzeria Bianco apart!  It is a little on the expensive side, and the waits can be a little long, but don't let that stop you.   . . First off, the wine bar next store is perfect.  We usually grab a bottle of wine and a cheese plate and enjoy the Hertiage District gardens.  There's also a pretty decent pub across the street, but since the wine bar is linked to Bianco they'll come find you there when your table is ready-a small bonus.. . Of course, the real reason to come is the pizza!  Supposedly Chris Bianco spent a few years hunting down the perfect flour, water, and yeast for his unique pies.  Whether it's true or just a legend, the taste seems to back it up.  The crust has a perfect light and chewy texture that's still crisp on the outside.  It has a nutty flavor that I haven't had anywhere else, probably a combination of the wood smoke and overnight resting of the dough.  I usually go for the Sonny Boy (tomato sauce, salami, and olives)  but you can't go wrong with any of the six pizza choices I've tried.  If you do go for an option with the red sauce, you'll be impressed by the simple, fresh taste of the superb tomatoes.  The cheese and remaining ingredients are every bit as fresh and complimentary to the balanced flavors.  Bianco is the perfect special occasion pizza.
We loved it.  Ordered every single pizza they make .  7 of us just went wild sampling and shoveling.  Great cold antipasto & mozz. appetizer.    . . Favorite part...local soda!  No coke or pepsi.  Supported the local soda mfg.  Thought the world of them for that.  Great staff...best place to eat dinner in downtown Phoenix.  Other restaurants we tried were awful.
Okay... . . There are plenty of pizza's out there. I like lots of them. Hard to find bad pizza. There are many pizza's that come very close but I have to say this is probably the best pizza I ever tasted.. . I liked the sonny boy. I tried a couple others. They are quality.
Delicious! I've been to Italy and this is the closest I've tasted to real Italian za! I had the  sonny boy and it was amazing! I highly recommend it. The wine is overpriced in my book but worth it for the pizza. I will definitely come back!
It was about 4 years ago. Long wait since locals compete with tourists.  But pizza is good only if eaten hot/fresh.
never been able to make it in the door.  the line is always long and decide to try another time.  maybe one day.
Only go here when you're not starving, and you have lots of time to kill. We waited an hour and a half for a table, and honestly, if we weren't with other people there's no way I'd wait to eat a friggin pizza. At least it was a cool evening and we could have wine while we waited. The atmosphere is charming and the pizza crust is really, really, really delicious! I don't eat dairy and ordered my pizza cheese free and it was good! I'd go back for sure, but like I said, only when I have time to spare.
Went here on a Thursday night got right in been here a few times usually get the Weiss guy there service is excellent. The pies are about as authentic as Ive seen other than my grandmothers table. Also the atmosphere is quaint and quiet couldn't have been more pleased..
Definitely worth the hype - and we went early, so we got a great seat outside on a perfectly beautiful day.  The pizzas were delicious, and I love that you can do half and half.  We also had a market salad, with arugula and goat cheese, and it was fresh and lovely.  I wish they had more beer/wine by the glass, but that is a minor quibble.
I was in town visiting my hubs who was in Phoenix on business (March 2014). We had the margherita w/wood-fired mushrooms and the Rosa. Both were great, but the Rosa was the standout winner!  Ordered the Sonny Boy and Wise Guy pizzas for people in his crew who thought they were amazing. When I left town, he and members of the crew couldn't wait to get off to go get pizza there and if they went in late (1pm) it was breakfast. Word spread :). . Just a note: this place does not do take out and they get really, really busy. I did not know that and came in to take pizzas away (for the crew). It was almost a problem, but the manager asked the kitchen and they said they had space in the oven to do it. I was really appreciative of their professionalism and accommodation. Great service, I do not forget.
Definitely worth the long wait! The food is simply amazing and the atmosphere is quaint! I would recommend the Margherita pizza.
The food at Pizzeria Bianco was okay, but I was actually thoroughly disappointed in my experience. It may have been that it had been built up for me for a long time, but the wait was long, the food wasn't the greatest, and the place itself was a bit cramped.. . 1. Wait-time: Before I actually had my first dining experience there, I had tried 4 times previously to eat at Pizzeria Bianco. They don't take reservations, and the line is always out the door (or at least with 4-5 other groups ahead of you). On the day I actually had enough time to wait, I waited around 30 minutes to get seated, and another 10 or so for a waiter, and another 20 after that for the food to come out, for about an hour of total waiting time. . **One good thing about the wait was that they had another building for you to sit and order appetizers/drinks if you wanted before you got seated.. . 2. Food: I don't quite understand the hype of this pizza. The crust was burnt and the toppings were not the best either- I tried three types of pizza, sharing it with the friends I was with, but honestly, none of them struck me as absolutely amazing. . . 3. Small room: I would estimate that there are about 8 tables at the place. Even after waiting for so long, we were stuck at the farthest corner of the restaurant by the restroom, and even that table was severely cramped. One of my friends was squished into the corner while another was awkwardly eating off of a side. . . I don't regret this experience at all- I have to say it was worth trying, just because it was rated the"Best Pizza in the US" by various celebrity/food critic sources. I just personally wouldn't claim it as the best pizza I've ever had.
Certainly didn't live up to all the hype.  The crust had no flavor just like eating flour and water, the center was mushy with burnt crust.  Guess that's why they couldn't put a few more toppings and cheese on it the crust would not support it.  Had just a dab of sauce on it which they are known for and couldn't taste it.  Yes it was fresh but for the price certainly not worth it, probably had 50 Cents worth of topping on a $18.00 pizza.    Wonder if James Beard got the same pizza's we were served.  I agree with another viewer that they need more help, if your going to wait a hour and a half at their "outdoor bar" the least you could have better service and not just left there waiting. He's one smart cookie making a lot of money on a really cheap pizza with a few fresh ingredients on it.  People wake up you can buy a really nice meal for $18.00!. '
