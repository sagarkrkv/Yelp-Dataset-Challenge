Besides the long wait to get in this place is nothing but uber cool. The jalapeno poppers are crunchy yet sily smooth on the inside, the fries are perfectly cooked with a great truffle aoli. The pork hog burger had bags of flavour and perfectly cooked shreds pork patties sealed the deal as one of the best out there. The service was super friendly and eficient. I liked that you could fill out a quick survey at the end to rate your experience.. Food 9/10 service 8.5/10 decor 9/10
The burger was fantastic and definitely one of the top 5 burgers I've ever eaten. However the fries whereseverely lacking, soggy and not at all complimentary to the meal
Since it was Vegas, I knew there would be a wait, which was fine. Besides, I only waited for a few minutes. Sat down at the bar, and received a warm welcome by them. I asked for suggestions and they really good about asking what I liked in a burger. I went with their European Burger, that had goat cheese and other strong tasty cheeses and it was GREAT. Small but mighty burger. Also ordered some fries to share and it was worth it. . The meal was not big in quantity, but it made it up for the quality. I will be back to try different burgers in the future.
My housemates and I love watching Master Chef, so a visit to BurGR is a must on our Vegas checklist. Our party of 5 waited a bit more than an hour for a table, which is fine granted this is dinner on Friday night in Vegas. I give this place 4 stars because:. . +truffle fries and the sauces are to die for!!. +waiter was very kind and patient and knowledgeable of the menu. +I tried the euro burger, which is delicious if you like goat cheese. I think it really brings out the medium rare taste of the meat. Friends had the farm burger and chanterelle, which was both amazing as well. . +it is evident that every detail of this place had thought put into it, from silverware to the menu to what the waiters and waitresses wore. Gordan Ramsay puts perfection above my expectations. . . The only con about this dining experience was the long wait after we ordered our food. I felt as if I waited longer than the time it took me to eat my dinner. . . Overall, if you'rein Vegas and you are a fan of burgers, try BurGR and you won't regret it!
Had lunch at the Las Vegas Gordon Ramsay BurGR reataurant, with my wife and another couple.  Our wait time wasn't too bad; perhaps only 20 minutes or  so.  Thought it would be more judging from the line! Very trendy place; very much in keeping with most places in Las Vegas at this level.  Service was okay, and I liked the tables, menus and even the fact that the server immediately brought another dish as my wife and I said we'd share an entree.  We had the Britannia burger, and it was very tasty, although on the smaller side.  The four of us shared a tower of onion rings; not usually my first choice, but this time I'm glad we had them.  Recommend it!
AMAZing.. Each of us (5) ordered a different burger and each was amazing, couldn't decide which was our favorite! Fries were great too with 2 different sauces.. Highly recommend the whiskey lemonade drink!! :) best burger I have ever had
I LOVE Gordon Ramsay so I was really excited to visit BurGR after seeing it on the MasterChef challenge last season. I saw those awesome flames out front and BAM I knew I was having a burger here. . . They don't take reservations but the line to get a table moved very quickly around late lunch time. The prices are also great or at least compared to what I would pay for a bomb burger here in NYC. . . The portions on the sides are pretty big so I would recommend sharing them. We were so stuffed from our breakfast we decided to split a burger too! I decided we should have the uber cheese burger.. I am a cheese slut... I love it mmmmm. . . We asked for the burger medium rare and when it came to the table I was pretty convinced it was rare rare rare... the BF was happy but I couldn't do it. The texture is too much for me when it is this rare. I said something to the waiter and at first he argued with me but then snapped out of it and had the kitchen make us a new one.. . The 2nd burger came out really quickly and was absolutely delicious. I couldn't leave this joint without one of those amazing looking milk shakes either so I was excited when the waiter told us we could get it to go. We had the carmel chocolate one and the hazelnut coffee one. They were lush oh my god. SO good but also SO filling. I wish I could say I finished mine but no such luck. . . I am looking forward to my next trip to Vegas so I can come back for more burger heaven. :-)
This is now our third Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I like to think of his approach as basic but refined. There are few foods more essential (the sense of basic) than a hamburger.. . His poppers come in shot glasses filled with sauce. Very spicy, but the jalapeno flavor comes through. The farm burger egg was perfectly cooked and decadent from first bite. finely sliced duck ?leg passes for bacon in this really decadent hamburger.. The Uberburger's three cheeses make one of the best cheeseburgers I have ever tasted. . . Two asides; I discovered a beer called Linkenkugen that will surely be one of my all-time favorites and They put a Europa League soccer game up for me. That's unusual in the US but just made everything shine just a little more.
After waiting in line for an hour we were given the privilege of paying $18 for a burger that had more salt in it than the ocean.. . Sweet potato fries were good.. . Service is good. But they only gave us lip service about salt in burger.. . Rip off and way over rated. People are like deer in the headlights. Way too enamored by fame of the owner.
I don't usually give out 5 stars but this place was phenomenal.  The first time was for dinner.  Hour wait but they give you a Pager and it extended pretty far out into the casino.  A day later before leaving for the airport had to return around noon on Wednesday.  No wait.  The burgers are memorable and so was the onion rings.  We will return in the future. They can serve as many add 50000 burgers in a weekend I was told.
Definitely lived up to the hype!!!  I absolutely loved my burger, the Hell's Kitchen Burger...DELICIOUS!!  Although everything was pretty much electronic, we had a very attentive server, and our food came out in a decent amount of time...nice and fresh!! My next trip to Vegas, I will return :o)
#GordonRamsay BurGR was too noisy for conversation. Very crowded, long wait, okay service, cute uniforms - like what burger waitresses would wear on the Enterprise. Enjoyed the truffle oil fries and my portobello mushroom burger. Liked the technology - texting guests for table instead of getting those vibrating coaster things. Also using an iPad as a menu ... very expensive for a burger place. They were good, but not THAT good. It was #MarchMadness that week, so but what's to be expected? Doubt I'll return at $60 for a very basic burger dinner, but glad we checked it out.
This is my favorite burger place for the price range ( I like Stripburger which is about 1/2 the price but not as good). I have been five or 6 times and tried quite a few things from the menu, but here are my favorites". . Chicken Slider App- if you like chic-fil-a and appreciate a good chicken sandwhich I would try this. It is really flavorful chicken and comes with a good sriacha flavored mayo that is pretty amazing. You get 2 in an order. . . Farm burger- I don't even know what duck bacon is, how it is made, or if it is even really a thing. What I do know is that it is delicious. Any burger with a fried egg is generally what I gravitate towards at a burger place and this egg was perfect- "Breaking the yoke is the customer's pleasure"- true words Gordon.. . Truffle Parmesan Fries- comes with a great aoli- make sure whatever fries you get that you get all the dipping sauces to try them. I usually get sweet potato fries, and the ones here are great- but these are slightly better imo.The sweet potato fries come with a shaker of vanilla powdered sugar and while it is totally out of character for me I find it to be a bit much- every time I see someone shake that thing I hear Wilford Brimley in my head saying "dia-beet-us". Good in small doses, not a whole order.. . . If that isn't your ideal meal, here are some other good items. . Jalapeno poppers- the star here is the sauce they come in which is delicious and creamy. I think many people don't read the menu but you get like 7 poppers, 6 are mild and 1 is much spicier - they don't tell you which is the spicy one so proceede with caution if you don't like spice. . . Pig Bao Buns- these are great and only barely edged out by the chicken sliders. . . Britania burger- the mangu chutney on this makes it super awesome. I would advice requesting they go easy on the arugula though. . . Blue Burger- when they say blue cheese they aren't kidding- you get a healthy slab of it here not little crumbles- that can be good or bad depending on how much chest hair you have. . . . A few people have dinged the service- and yes the service is not on park with GR Steak- but its a burger place. The service is commensurate with the restaurant design. I will say the waitresses, while generally quite attractive, have to wear perhaps the most unattractive uniforms I have ever seen.. . There is generally going to be a long wait during peak hours- this place is really popular and many out of towners want to go because they are GR fans. They will take your name and text you when your table is ready so there is no range restriction- go check out the Miracle Mile shops or walk around on the strip to kill time.
One of my absolute favorite burger spots!. The poppers are fresh and have real kick!. The duck bacon on The Farm Burger was unreal, but as much as I loved it. The Hog Burger took it's place as king.. Now with all this talk of burgers, DO NOT miss out on the hotdogs, one of the best Iv'e had in town.
Great Onion rings, long lines and limited Vegetarian options.  . . . I can't say this is the best burger place I've been, or even a top contender.  As a vegetarian, I expect a fancy burger joint to have a housemade veggie or vegan burger to choose from.  Growing up as a vegetarian, I always had two options at restaurant: A frozen gardenburger or a portabella mushroom sandwich.  Now, those were the days when vegetarians were few and far between.   But now when I see those options, I think lazy and uncreative, definitely not what I would expect from a Gordon Ramsey establishment.  I ordered the only option I had as a vegetarian, a mushroom burger made like their cheesy burger.  It was a bunch of sliced portabella mushrooms stacked on top of each other, which was impossible to eat. With each bite a slippery slice flew out of my bun until I finally gave up and pulled all the mushrooms out.  Luckily, I really enjoyed their truffle fries and housemade onion rings, so the experience was not a complete bust.  . . The server was attentive and noticed that I didn't not eat much of my food, and asked if I did not care for it. I told her I just wasn't a fan of the mushrooms but it was fine.  She insisted on taking it off the bill... which was not expected but appreciated. . . All said and done...  No, I will not wait 45 minutes to dine here again.
I think I might've over-hyped this place for me, making me feel disappointed about the burgers. I'll try and give it my best review for this place though.. . Burger: I tried over 4 burgers here and they have always been the servers recommendations, and their recommendations didn't fail what so ever. I will admit the burger wasn't dry, the patties were tender and juicyjust like how a real burger should be. It's not so much of an explosion of flavor or something along the lines of "WOW, I never tasted this before!", it's just that the meat quality is really good.. . The thing I would honestly only come here for:. The Jalepino Poppers. They fried perfectly, so you don't burn your tongue when you bite into these delectables. They come half dipped in these shot glass, filled with a nice tangy and creamy sauce. Even dipped, the poppers are soggy, still retaining their crunchiness. I would surprisingly say, this is a must try more than the burgers!!. . Oh one thing, always try to yelp this place up and call it to make reservations! sometimes the line can get long, but the wait isn't that long, you just end up standing in front of this art that has fire just pouring out. It gets pretty hot if there stand there for awhile. SO MAKE RESERVATIONS!!
I've tried GR's other more expensive restaurants and quite honestly, I have not been impressed.  I just tried Burgr, going in with very low expectations and glad to report the burger was good!  No, this was not the best burger that I've ever had as honestly, BJ's Brewhouse has a burger that is better and more tasty, but all in all for the price point, this was not bad!  The onion rings were good as well.  For a decent price, we received a decent burger but nothing that I found to be exceptionally great, but wouldn't mind going back either.
This is the second time that we have eaten there. We have tried the Farm Burger and the Hell's Burger. The truffle fries were to die for! Christina Wilson, a winner from Hell's Kitchen, even took the time to take a picture with our kids. They were beyon thrilled! Many kiddos!!!
This place is really good! The prices are not too bad considering its on the strip where everything is way over priced. We went on saturday night and waited for about 30 minutes before going in. The food was great and the service awesome! We had the jalapeno poppers, the euro burger and the parm truffle fries. Everything was amazing! And our glasses never got empty before we got a refill, the service was really good. The food is great, definitely worth it.
One of the best burgers I have had.  The meat was cooked perfect.  It was very juicy.  The truffle fries were also really good.   I would highly recommend.  If you want to avoid the lines get there before 11am!
Was curious to see how this place is since we always passed by it when going to Vegas.. . The food was actually pretty good. The burgers were delicious, not the best that I've had, but pretty good none the less.. . The shakes though were soooo good!. One of the bests that I had! I ordered the Oreo Shake with Creme brulee pudding and I couldn't put it down till it was done.. . Service was pretty good. No real complaints.. . Would recommend to try if you want a place with good burgers, good atmosphere and not too pricy either!
I cannot say enough about the food, it was amazing!! The server was very nice, the only negative was we had a party of 8 an we had to separate the tables an the hostess was a little snotty about the whole thing. Get some new front service an it would be a 10/5!!
This place isn't all that great. Was able to try after a long family vacation in a mansion rental. My guest and I were dropped off at the strip around breakfast time to find stuff to do before we had to head to the airport. It was almost 11 when we saw this cool burger joint with a fire-lit sign. Enticed by the fact that it was Gordon Ramsay's (asshole from Kitchen Nightmares) restaurant, i thought to myself, "i have to try this place." Unfortunately there is this giant picture of him, luckily my back faced it. . . My guest and I asked for our patties to be prepared differently. When the burgers came out, half way into eating, we realized that they were mixed up! Ugh -- i actually enjoyed my mistake, but my guest did not. That's a pretty big mistake on the restaurant's end. The burgers weren't all that special anyway.. . Maybe this place could be a late night drunk spot, but i don't see the hype. Yay for Vegas in general!
Decided to try Burgr because I love watching Gordon Ramsey on tv and he was promoting this place on masterchef. Also, heard great things about this restaurant through friends and family.I came here with high hopes that I would have a orgasm in my mouth, I even talked my mom into coming with me (she doesn't like burgers because she says it's fattening). I told her it had great reviews and she would like it. WRONG!! . . I ordered the jalapeno poppers and the jells kitchen burger. My fiance, the American burger? I forgot the name. And my mom, the hog burger and we all shared fries.. . Jalapeno poppers were the only good thing we ordered. The sauce was delicious. . . American burger: in&out will always be the best. It was so dry and bland. Asked for medium well got well done. . . Hell's kitchen: it was alright, it only tasted good because I put ketchup in it. Dry and asked for medium well also and got super well done.. . The hog burger: mediocre at best. My mom said mcdonalds Big Mac was even better.. . Fries: they were just fries. The sauces were tasty, but def nothing special.. . I forgot to mention, we waited 40 mins for our burgers! The reason why we didn't send our burgers back, we didn't wanna wait another 40 for them to get it right when it should've been the first time. . . Never coming back, at least we got to experience this place. Next on the list, Bachi Burger!
i wish i could give this place a 6, because that chocolate shake and truffle fries i had were simply the GREATEST. THING. EVER. pricey. but hey it's vegas.
This place was pretty good, I have to say the truffle Parmesan fries were out of this world, it would be worth going back just for the fries.  The whole decor and ambiance was very cool, it's a perfect upscale burger joint.  We also got the farm burger, hells kitchen burger, and chicken wings.  We decided on this order from other Yelp recommendations so I won't repeat what's already been said.  Everything was very good but I don't think i could justify more than a half hour wait just on the quality of food.  Side note, we realized once we were seated that there were about 5-8 empty tables in the restaurant at all times while there was a line of 15-30 people outside.  I get that they leave a few tables open for VIPs and such but it seemed like an awful waste with so many people waiting to be seated.  . . The milkshakes were a strange concept.  They were obviously trying to be different by putting a fist full of pudding at the top of the drink, but once all the milkshake beneath it was finished, it was very difficult and strange to try to suck the pudding up through the straw.  Also, the draft beers and milkshakes are served in these fancy tall glasses which look pretty cool but don't actually contain much liquid!  I ordered a second beer with my meal but only managed to take a few sips before wrapping up the meal so I asked for a to-go cup.  They were nice enough to bring me a standard sized (like a solo cup) plastic beer cup to pour it into but when I did I discovered it barely filled 2/3 the cup.  At those prices, that's kind of a bummer.
Gordon, you've done it again.. This was the absolute best birthday dinner a girl could have asked for.. . We arrived about 4:15pm on a Saturday, without a reservation.  Oops!  My mistake, I was supposed to call and make one, but didn't.  Luckily, my friends and I were not in a hurry.  It was my birthday dinner, and a thank you to my friend who does our taxes, so none of us had anywhere to be for a long time.  . We stood in line to check in for about 6 minutes, before I noticed the sign that said "check in with hostess first."  . Another oops on my behalf.  I shouldn't go places when I'm tired. . . So, the hostess checked me in, and said that they would send a text message to me when the table was ready, and let me know it would be probably an hour.  Awesome!  We don't have to stand in line the whole time. . . So we head over to the Heart Bar...which ended up being a not so awesome experience, but I'll save that for their review.  anyway, I got a text message about 20 minutes later saying that our table was ready!    . . We were seated, and our server came over, and introduced herself, and showed us how to use the iPad menus.  We each got a cocktail, (and one beer for my non cocktail friend)...they were all delicious!!  Mine was the best though (to me anyway), I had the skinny screw.  I need to go back JUST for one of these.  . . A note about our server...I wish I remember her name, I think it was Nicole?  (pretty blonde girl)...She was a darling.  So nice, very accommodating, and extremely friendly.   She even wrote happy birthday on our check!. . Appetizers: Jalapeno Poppers:  We had these served with the ranch on the side, since my fella is completely anti-ranch.  They were spicy and delicious!!!  I was so happy with these, and I don't really care for spicy food.  . Onion Rings:  omg nom.  I love onion rings and these were perfect.  . . Burgers:  My fella and I had the farm burger, and the uber cheese burger, with duck bacon added to mine for $3 extra.  Totally worth it.  They were both amazing...the burger was a perfect mid-rare, the egg oozed out with yummy yolk, and my uber cheese burger was SO delicious!  The goat's cheese was my favorite.  So creamy and delightful!  . I don't remember what the other 2 at the table had, I was too engrossed in my food.. . Truffle fries:  Wow!  So delicious!. . Dessert: Sticky toffee pudding push pops:. Wowza!  While I will admit, I liked the pudding at the steak house better, you have to hand it to Gordon for not being a one-trick pony.  Changing up his classic dessert and layering it in a push pop was delicious, and had a feeling of whimsical child-like fun to it.  I loved it!. . The crowning moment of this visit though, was that because it was my birthday, Christina (from Hell's Kitchen) who is the new executive chef, came over with our food to say hello, take a quick picture, and chat with me.  In fact...she mentioned that Gordon was going to be in town, and even checked her phone to find out what time!!  She was gracious, and amazing, and dealt with my star-struck silliness beautifully.  (I NEVER get star struck, but I was like a giddy school girl.). . All in all, the dining experience was incredible.  I can't wait to go back again!  Maybe I'll meet Gordon next time. ;)  . . Mr. Ramsay, you've got a perfect trio here in Vegas.  Amazing job.
The jalapeno poppers were awesome! They come in their own individual shot glasses with dipping sauce! I wasn't crazy about the sweet potato fries but the Parmesan truffle fries went fast! :)
It's simple, Gordon Ramsay wouldn't put his name on anything that is delicious.. Farm burger - if you're a fan of egg inside a burger, this is the one for you. . Parmesan fries - is a must, the garlic aioli definitely makes it better.. We only waited 5 min I get seated, and about 15 for our food.. Very satisfied.
Really good burgers andfries! Drinks were great as well. We did have to wait about 20 minutes to be seated but it was well worth it!
Excellent food and above and beyond service. Lauren our waitress was VERY accommodating and made our visit extremely pleasant. Would definitely return.
I'm not one for gimmicks, and I tend to avoid the Planet Hollywood hotel at all costs whenever I'm in town. It's not really the casino itself - it's just ... I try to keep my distance from Britney Spears in any medium, and that building-sized banner of her certainly qualifies. Wait a minute! THAT explains why the Miracle Mile Mall smells like bus stop and failure! Mystery solved!. . Still, as fate would have it, we found ourselves meat-hungry and within sight of Gordon Ramsay's Burgr. Man, that just sounds so dirty. Well, at least it isn't Britney's Burgr. ::Gasp::. . Anyway, I quickly scanned the reviews and many had mentioned the ridiculous standard wait times to get seated. Well, there was almost no line at the time, so we hopped in. I'm glad we did, because this place was great.. . Is it overpriced? Yes. It's Vegas - get over it. Does it do burgers and pretty much only burgers? Yes. And as the rule stands, if that's all you do, it better be outstanding. And it is. I'm happy to say it is. The best thing about the burgers here is the BUN. Stay with me. Too many burger joints make the mistake of garlic buttering and toasting the bun, making the burger appear more substantial but all but ruining the actually eating process. Plus, I'm paying for the burger, not the bun. At Burgr, the bun is exceptionally light. It's like eating air. It holds the accoutrements in place and keeps down the mess but enables an easier bite. This is an extremely functional - and tasty - burger, and one of the best I have had in a long time.
This place is WOW!. . This restaurant gem is located on the 1st floor of the Planet Hollywood hotel.  I went during dinner time and it gets REALLY crowded fast.  The good thing about this place is that you can put your name and number down and they will give you a call when your table is ready.  This is super convenient because this lets you go do something else (like gamble) without having to wait around a table for 1+ hours.. . I also have to praise the decor here as well. The restaurant logo in the front on fire, literally.  There are tiny flames that are ignited to surround the logo to really give that wow factor, (and maybe to emphasize how flame-broiled the burgers are here).. . When I get here, we started with the jalapeno poppers and onion rings.  Both were delicious and came out in these amazing plates/containers.  I personally thought the onion rings were much better than the poppers so if I had to choose one, I would get just the rings.  Then I ordered the chanterelle mushroom burger which was cooked to perfection.  The bun is soft and compliments the flavorful meat and toppings.  You can also tell this restaurant is well established because every dish ware here is customized for this restaurant.. . Lastly, we also ordered the coffee hazelnut milkshake.  This drink is just AMAZING.  There is a layer of milky coffee on the bottom and there is a thick creamy hazelnut pudding like texture on top.  I believe you mix the two to get the perfect consistency but they also taste so good separately.  One of the coolest and tastiest milkshakes I've had!. . To top it off, theservice was fast and great and really looked after us because we were sorta in a rush.  Thanks BurGR, I will be back!!
I absolutely love this place and I want to come here when I go to Vegas if I want to have a burger.. . Of course, like any restaurant made popular by a celebrity chef, expect a wait. If you have a group of people, except an extra long as wait and put your name in much longer than you expect to eat if you're going during dinner time. For couples, there is a line for two that goes by faster than you think. But like I said there is still a wait with no seating. While you're in line you also have a chance to look at a menu which is always nice. But, they do not show the drink options until you sit down. No fear they do sell beer.. . So, even with that said, I still loved this placed because of two reasons: the burger is made perfectly and our waitress (but I hope they are all like this) new her shit. As soon as we sat down she went through all parts of the menu describing popular favorites and her own in great detail. When we were ordering she offered the options of what to add to our burger because she had mention people before expecting more. To clarify, we ordered the blue burger and all it comes with is blue cheese and arugula and she had offered sun dried tomatoes at no extra charge or with extra charge bacon. My point is she was well prepared and clarified our order to a t. For an appetizer we order the bau buns which had delicious pork and Vietnamese people in little Saigon would probably kill us for spending that much but hey they were delicious. With our burger we had the parmesaen fries which come with a truffle mayo I believe which was redonculous and house made ketchup which is also good and some house made ketchups taste awful. By this time we were happy we splitthe burger because we were so full, or at least I was. And they aren't huge so if you don't want to share you don't have to.. . This place is so good, so please give it a chance!
A big disappointment....twice!  . . I am a big fan of Gordon's TV shows, so maybe I expected too much.  I found the burgers to be bland, the buns very dry.  The toppings were good.  The accouterments (fries, rings, etc.) were nothing special.  I wanted to give it 2.5, so you know.  For less money go to Ketchup Premium Burger Bar in Miracle mile.  Better food FAR better service.  Oh yea, the service is mediocre, just too busy for the number of staff.
The burgers were sexmazing , I would recommend this place for the burger connoisseur , start off with the wings they were fantastic.
My friends and I ate here after the Spartan Race last Saturday (April 5th) Around 3PM. There was a line, which I don't understand. We checked in and had a drink at the bar. They were correct, we waited around 30 minutes than we were seated. We sat in the front of the restaurant. Drinks were on iPads which was cool. The menu was diverse and we were starving. . . The jalapeno poppers were awesome! Each come in a separate glass with sauce so you can have your own. They were fried to perfection and delicious. . . I ordered the Farm Burger and my other friend had the Hell's Kitchen Burger. Both were amazing! The best fries ever were the Parmesan Truffle fries!! We also had the sweet potato fries, they were ok. They were covered with powdered sugar, but the sauce was also sweet too...didn't like it as much. . . Great portion sizes, not too bad a wait, hit the spot! I would come back again!
Great experience.  For the top notch food, service and desert (You must try the toffee push ups) it didn't even seem that expensive.  We will definitely be going back.
Four star review here because the burgers were amazing and our boys LOVED the shakes.  I do think Gordon needs to show up and whip his hostess staff into shape, because they were amazingly incompetent.  When we arrived there were 2 parties in front of us and no less than 5 hostesses trying to figure out how to seat these two parties in a half-full restaurant.  Apparently "the computer" wouldn't let them seat the parties.  And, not one of them seemed to have the brains to just handle it manually.  I have to believe Gordon would have been appalled.. . Once we got seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for our waiter to appear - again, the restaurant was probably half full.. . But, four stars because the burgers were just that good.  I had the Blue burger, my husband had the farm burger and one son had the hell's kitchen burger.  All were excellent.  The truffle fries were also amazing.  And our boys had the decadent shake with the creme brulee pudding on top.  . . Come hungry...and you'll still leave stuffed, but pack your patience to get in.
I love burgers. The best ones represent some of my favorite simple things in the food world: salt, crust on meat, flames, soft and toasted buns, tasty sides, etc. Add a tall cold beer, good service and perfect fries - and that's all we need. BRGR was SDLY JST NT GOOD. Waiting in line for 15 minutes, no big. Two beers took forever, waitress was inattentive, food arrived and the burgers were decent but the "just fries" were uncooked planks of tuber and weren't even hot. Switched them for sweet potato fries (another 10 minutes? WTH?), paid and bailed. Go have YOUR perfect burger at the burger place in Cosmo - waaaay better!
Ridiculously overpriced... as is most of Las Vegas.  The Uber Cheeseburger was decent but nothing special and certainly not worth $15.  $11 french fries were bland.  Frankly not worth the truffles.  Had the Hog Snack appetizer... tasty but again, not worth the expense.. . I'm a fan of Ramsey's BBC show.  Hate the American version.  Had to try it.  Now that I've tried it, there is no reason to go back.   Next time I'll get a double King at Fatburger and be a much happier man.. . $50 better spent at the Bellagio Buffet..... . :  Masochist that I am I went to GR's PUB for lunch as well a few days later.  Thought I would try the Authentic Fish and Chips.   $27 for Fish and Chips?  They were fine but I got a place down a few blocks from where I live that has just as good for around $7.. . The Scotch Egg was very very good.  Not Greasy.  Extra bits of bacon really made it worth while.. . I know it's Vegas but I long for the Mob Run days when you could get a great steak dinner for under $10.
It was a 2 hour wait, so we have to walk around and come back. They get  your number to send you a message when your table is ready which was cool.. . Their service: There service was great, the hostess tried to talk to us a little bit and asked if it was our first time, and thank us for waiting, and ask where we are from and all that, our server was great too, he came to check up on us here and there.. . The appetizer: We had the pork belly bun, it didn't look great but the taste was good.. . The burger: I had the duck/bacon burger which I think was okay. My bf had the big hot dog, i forgot what it was called but I have a picture of it. I didn't finish my burger, I only had half of it and took the rest home, if it was that good i would of finish the whole thing and not leave any left over.. . OVerall i didn't think it was what i expected maybe i had a higher expectation because it was one of Gordon Ramsay restaurant, but i wouldn't mind coming back to try other food because maybe the ones i tried didn't make me satisfied.
Holy shit. I've just finished the last bite of the most delicious beef burger I've ever had, and my mind still can't comprehend that such a simple combination of meat, arugula, bun, and blue cheese resulted in that much flavor. . . Let's break this baby down:. . Burger Patty - All beef, medium-rare. It came out slightly more medium which was great as the edges were cooked just right to bring out the flavor of the meat whereas the inside was more rich and juicy.. . Buns - White bread with sesame seeds, sweet. They had to have spread butter and then grilled these. The sesame provided enough grip despite the juices squeezing out with every bite and were overall structurally sound so my burger remained intact until it was no more.. . Arugula - Possibly slightly cooked or tossed with something? Also very sweet and buttery tasting. Great complement to the rest to the burger.. . Blue Cheese - This version was like a spread and although it didn't evenly cover the patty all the time, it was amazingly flavorful and had a tang to it that toned down what would have been an overwhelmingly buttery meal.. . The coffee was really good, too -- didn't need to use any creamer and it wasn't bitter but wasn't weak either.
We loved the garlic truffle dipping sauce that came with the truffle fries!  I think it was just mayonnaise with minced garlic and truffles, but it was delicious!  Without the dipping sauce the fries were just okay, the truffle flavor definitely comes from the sauce.  I had the farm burger; the duck bacon was salty and meaty!  My husband had the blue burger.  . . Whenever we passed by, there was a long line outside the restaurant.  I think that was the initial reason we wanted to eat there!  On our last day, we lined up at 10:50 a.m. (10 minutes before opening) and we were seated promptly at 11:05.  Overall, it's kind of pricey, $40 for two burgers and fries (before tip).  But it's worth checking out if you want to try one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants on a budget.
Great BurGR at a moderate price. For starters, there was a pretty long line but they have an "up with the times" way of taking your reso-they just text you. We only waited about 30 minutes so not too shabby considering the length of the line. We had the Honey-Pig Bao Buns to start which were amazing considering you like pork belly. I also had the Farmer Burger which would've been perfect if the fried egg on top had the delicious runny yolk you would expect once you bite into it. Mine was basically an over-hard egg. In most cases I would've sent it back but I was too hungry to part with it. Other than that it was cooked perfectly and tasted great. The sweet potato fries were heavenly once dipped in the sauce provided. I will definitely be back to try another burger and a milkshake next time. The only other critique I have other than my pathetically fried egg is the service. Our server was friendly, cute, always kept our drinks full. She was not the problem. However the hostess stand could use some training in customer service. There are about 4-5 girls standing up there doing absolutely nothing. Because of the set up and how busy it typically is, it can be a bit confusing whether to go up to the hostess stand or get in line with the others. Typically there are tourists standing around with a confused look on their face and I did not see even one of the five hostess offer them any help. I still recommend giving this place a try!
Usually I am a 4 star bore, almost formulamatically handing out four stars no matter how vicious I am in my actually commentary. I've got to give three to this place though partly because of the name associated with it (I simply expected a lot more.. . Let's start with what's good about it. It has a cool vibe, although a little chaotic. It occupies a great location in PH. It's nice to see PH has finally figured out what to do with its former poker room/high limit/high roller/ they don't know what the hell to do with it room. And for being in a prime location it was reasonably priced. . . Now the bad. The food is mediocre. I had the fish sandwich on the recommendation of my waiter, and my friends had hamburgers. My fish sandwich was beautifully presented, but that was the highlight. The piece of fish itself was very good, but the fried toast bun was way to greasy. My friends hamburgers both cam medium rare, but only one was order that way. I tasted both and found them to be bland and surprisingly dry for being as rare as they were. Most importantly though, there was nothing unique about them. They were just burgers with a lot of flair. My friends both ordered milkshakes which were good, but both were essentially creamy puddings masquerading as a milkshake. Again, good, and somewhat unique, but not $9 a piece good. That is the only thing I thought was really over priced. I had a Johnny Walker Black and it was delicious, but I don't think the restaurant had much to do with that. . . As a local I know of several burger places in town that far out strip this place. I don't want to drop names but there is an Asian Fusion burger place in town that blows this place out of the water for comparable prices. And for better flavor at much better prices there's a place owned by a group of guys, five of them I think, that is a much better meal and value. . . So for the tourist I say this is an OK place to go.It is owned by a famous chef, it is in a great location, and it is an OK meal. Most places on the strip for this price are merely just OK meals. It is worth eating at and getting your picture taken out by the sign. For locals we all know better places which are much easier to get to.
I got the Farm House burger which wasn't bad and tried my friends Hells Kitchen burger which was way better. I feel like the burgers are a little overrated since I've been to multiple places who's burgers top BurGR. (Umami, Fathers Office, Haus Dog, Sladers 50/50, The Counter...) . I do recommend you get a milkshake. I had the Oreo creme brulee one which was amazing. Definitely one of the top shakes I've tried in my years.
There's not a whole lot to say. This is by far the best burger I've had anywhere in the world (ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger on two separate occasions). To top it off they have great fries, great shakes and a great selection of craft beers. . . The only downside is you need to be prepared to wait. I've only been twice so far, both at "off" times, and we still had to wait about 45 minutes each time. For future reference, put your name in, then walk around the Miracle Mile shops while you wait. They'll text you when your table is almost ready.
If you're into gourmet burgers, this place is a must try! It's prob the best gourmet burger I've ever had! I tried the Hell's Kitchen burger and the Southern Yardbird burger, both were soo delicious. It doesn't look too big, but they are filling! One order of fries is more than enough per two people. Prices are pretty reasonable too, about 13-17 dollars a burger. Just the thought of it makes me want to go back!
A decent burger but it wouldn't even break into my top 5 local burger joints. We must have been luckyto have gone during an off time because after reading some of the reviews, I woulda been pissed if we waited in a long line. .      Having said that the service there was top notch. They always came by to make sure we were good while taking the time to explain the menu to us. Additionally the "poppers" were pretty damn good. We even kept some of the sauce to put on our burger. .      Our three burgers ranged from ok to good. Nothing bad, but also nothing worth waiting in line for. After two visits, the sticker shock from burgers and fries didn't go away after the first visit. Maybe it's just me but I must be in the minority on the truffle fries. They were basically steak fries with shredded Parmesan. Way to big and mushy with little truffle taste. .       If Burgerz was owned by Joe Blow instead of mr Ramsay I'm not sure they would still be in business. Clearly the name is the draw here while many of the patrons will be one time, out of town visitors willing to wait/pay to eat a burger made by Gordon Ramsay.
4.5 stars.. . Great burgers! The sweet potato fries sprinkled with crack..(powered sugar) is amazing. Don't kid yourself..sweet potato FRIED instantly loses its healthy label..so might as well add sugar and really enjoy it.
My roommate and I came to Vegas for spring break and I was super excited to try this place out since it's one of the cheaper restaurant but still by Gordon Ramsay.  . . We had a show to catch at 9 so we wanted to have dinner at around 6:30. Unfortunately they do not take reservations... WHY?!?!. . To start, we shared the sweet potato friesand the jalapeno poppers. The fries come with vanilla powder sugar and honey jalapeno mayo. The fries are fried nicely and pair really well with the powder sugar; however, we weren't a fan of the honey jalapeno mayo. It sounded good, but the mayo didn't taste that great.  The jalapeno poppers were also a let down. They seemed like they've been sitting on the counter for a little bit. It would have been a lot better if they were hot. Not only were they a let down, the jalapeno poppers also made my friends and I sick. I felt sick almost immediately after dinner and my two friends were really sick the following morning. My stomach still feels queasy just thinking a bout it... Just be warned, they are pretty spicy and could possible make your stomach on fire!. . The burgers we got were solid, but the burger places in L.A. still have my heart. . I might give it another try next time I visit Vegas, but no more jalapeno poppers!
Burger was amazing, fries were ok. But seriously, burgers are to die for. :) it's open late, and we got seated very quickly. If you bring your free total rewards card you get discounts on the food items.
Best Burger On the Strip. . . My husband and I have tried most burger places on the strip and BurGR is, hands down, our favorite. He always gets his burger completely plain - meat + bun - which is a guaranteed way to find out how good the meat is. BurGR's is fantastic. Juicy, high quality, delicious meat! And the buns are big and fluffy with sesame seeds which I love. They're starting with just a great base here. All of the ingredients are obviously very high quality. . . I'm more adventurous and like to try different flavor combinations. I've tried most and The Farm Burger is my favorite. A server we'd gotten to know suggested I try adding avocado and it took it from fantastic to WOW! The Hell's Kitchen burger is spicy and delicious so if you like spicy try that. I love arugula so I tried the Euro Burger but it was just a bit rich for me. Delicious but really rich. . . We've tried all of the fries and the Just Fries are just right. They're the thick kind and are served with 2 different really nice ketchups - curry and chipotle. . . I tried the Kale Apple Ceasar Salad which, if you like those 3 items (Kale, apples, a ceaser) you will love! And the shakes are completely decadent. But to be honest, once we'd been a few times I stopped trying any of the extras because a burger + 1/2 an order of fries is a meal! The servings are large and filling. . . I noticed some complaints about the wait between ordering and being served. It's true that if it's busy, it can be slow. We don't really mind as the food is so good and clearly made fresh. We treat it more as a yummy dinner out than a quick bite. I think some people expect very quick service with a burger. This is more of a sit down meal. But our solution if we're really hungry is to to order one order fries as an appetizer right when we sit down and order drinks. The serving is so big we can easily nosh on that and still have plenty left over when the actual burgers, and any other items, arrive. . . We keep trying new places and BurGR keeps winning! In fact, I might just need a Farm Burger for dinner tonight!
Good but not fantastic. The jalapeno poppers were very good, as long as you like bacon. Our only real disappointment was our burgers were a little dry. We ordered well-done as always, but they were borderline burnt. Everything was tasty, but not over-the-top excellent. One appetizer, one order of (yummy) truffle parmesan fries, two burgers and a soda came to $60 with tax, before tip. I've had better burgers for less, but I guess we we're paying for the Gordon Ramsay experience! Service was excellent.
Gordon is lucky I'm giving the second star and it's mostly for the fries (I really liked them). But this place (along with MANY others) have fallen in to the "we don't give a damn about vegetarians so give them a portobello". . . That's pretty sad considering they charge $12 for it. . . It tasted lame and was very rubbery. I've made better at home on a cast iron skillet on my lunch hour. . . If you are a veg this is your ONE option and that is pitiful. . . Gordon, you can do better.
Good budget good fries great drinks.  Chef Ramsay makes a good burger.  I would go back
Was honestly the most amazing burger i ever had. the bun was light fresh and tasty the burger was perfectly medium the toppings were great...I had the Hells Kitchen burger with rosted jalapenos & oven roasted tomatoes and a nice slice of avocado! The truffle Parmesan fries were amazing with the mushroom aioli sauce and ketchup. Along with a nice tall blue moon beer perfectly chilled! And the girl from his show Hells Kitchen (the winner) winner was there busting her butt for sure (forgive me I don't know her name)
Alright, to be fair and honest, we ended up going to BurGR while I was abstaining from meat for Lent. So I do not have any thoughts or comments on how amazing the beef burgers are. I do have comments on how amazing the Earth Burger was. On the menu there is one vegetarian option and that is the Earth Burger. I have had plenty of vegetarian-friendly burgers over the years, but this burger is definitely one of my favorites. I did not feel like I was missing out by having one. To top it off, I ordered Shake #4 - the oreo, creme brulee pudding shake. I'm a such sucker for sweets and desserts. So when I saw that I could not say no. After one sip, I was in dessert heaven. The pudding - oh man the pudding!!! That was the shining star in the combo. Thick, rich and decadent. I'd go back just for the shake alone.
One of the best if not the best burger that I have ever eaten. No condiments needed...the burger speaks for itself. What else can I say. The burger has been elevated to a whole new level. Good job Gordon Ramsay!
burger and fries were delicious!!! had the banana shake, which was just okay. customer service was excellent. wait was a little long though.
Food was great, experience . . . not so much.. . The 1.5 hour quoted wait time ballooned to nearly 2.5 hours. We had the cornmeal crusted fried chicken app and it was fantastic. Unfortunately, the kitchen or server lost our ticket so that was another 30 minute wait for the re-fire.. . Burgers were perfectly prepared and seasoned. Truffle fries were good. . . We had to wait another 15 minutes for the server to return with the credit card after paying. . . So . . . service would be 1 star, food . . . 4. It's worth trying out for sure.
I decided to break my pescatarian streak for an "American Burger"and "just fries" because Gordon Ramsay is a bad ass,.. and because I'm in Vegas. After a long pool day yesterday I wanted a quick bite, so I was able to cut the long line at Burger and sit at the bar since i was solo. My girlfriend was napping.. . I sat at the bar for about 10 minutes and neither bartender acknowledged me with eye contact,  "I'll be right with you" or  a " can I grab you a beer? ". Instead of speaking up with an "uuhum" I just walked out since I was already too irritated. Probably not the best way to handle it but I was in no mood to complain. . . Today I went back with a new attitude and again sat at the bar. Totally different experience with the same bartender. Food was perfect! I even got one to go... .  The only downside is that they wouldn't whip up some thousand island dressing but they do have really good chipotle and curry ketchups.
UGH...We were so disappointed when m y husband and I went to Burgr last weekend.  This was our second time we went to Burgr.  The first time (about a year ago) the food was amazing.  This time it was horrible!  Everything came out burnt.  Service was rude and very short with us.  It was not worth the wait or money.  We will never go there again.
The wife and I came here for lunch and we were very impressed! The restaurant had a hip, stylish vibe with the fire decor in the front. Great menu with plenty of more-than-basic options to choose from. I ordered the fish and chips sandwich which was great! She ordered a jalapeno burger and truffle fries which were amazing as well. Only down fall was the two drunk idiots that sat down at our table and started making out.... WTH JUST HAPPENED! The waitress asked if they were with us and quickly got them out HAHA maybe have a railing around the outside table so no one thinks that there's open seating??? Other than the drunken stupidity, I loved every bit of it and definitely recommend going!
We went on a Monday night around 8pm and the line was long. It wouldnt have been so bad if the heat from the sign wasnt making us both sweat like pigs.  Thank God we werent seated by that fire window of hell! Anywho, clearly we both ordered milk shakes which were amazing until we got to the bottom and the pudding that was formerly on the top was all that was left. It was a thick almost flavorless gunk that was less than appetizing which we could have easily done without. Having worked in restaurants it was disappointing to wait in line for almost 45 minutes to get inside and see that most of the staff had no sense of urgency. Tables that were empty sat uncleaned for much longer than I would expect and the appetizer didnt come out until after we were finished with our shakes. The wings were awesome and both burgers were delish (Farm & Hells Kitchen) but being 8 months preggo I ordered medium well and it was at best medium rare but I made it this far so I figured whats a little blood! Lol The fries and onion rings were average but the sauces were wonderful compliments. . Long story short great food, polite knowledgeable server but slooow service and such horrible outfits on such pretty girls. We will return for the food expecting a wait, undercooked burgers (which normally I like) and milk shakes hopefully without the icky pudding!
First off it took an over an hour for our food to get there, making Ramsay a total hypocrite. He would have verbally assaulted himself if it were on one of his TV shows. The service was good, pretty simple menu. Which is the thing that bothers me if your going to have a simple menu it better be great food, and it just wasn't. Sweet pickles on a burger does not make it any classier. I don't care who you are or how classy you think you are, ketchup belongs on the table at a burger restaurant. Overall this place has all the bells and whistles looks great, but the food is average at best, and the restaurant itself is unorganized. Gordan Ramsay sold out and put his name on a below average restaurant.
We came for lunch and got a seat right away. We started with the roasted jalapeno popperswhich were served in little cups. These were good and spicy.  My daughter got the Hell's Kitchen burger and loved it.  I got the fresh roasted chili dog and it was amazing but huge!!  Dessert, had the shake. This is a must try place to eat in vegas.
A decent burger, but the prices are a tad high ($10 for french fries).
Amazing burgers!! So amazing.. That the boyfriend and I went twice in one day!!! Breakfast and dinner!! Breakfast-My boyfriend got the Euro burger medium well.. It tasted like heaven!! I got the Hells Kitchen Burger and no other can ever compare!!! Burger set the bar WAY UP!!  Dinner- boyfriend got the Euro Burger AGAIN (YEP THAT GOOD) I had the chili dog ... (Trying out the menu) and another bar setter! Ramsey took a hot dog and took it to a whole different level! Delicious!!
We went to Las Vegas to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday. Being fans of Chef Ramsay's shows, my 21 year old wanted to dine at one of Chef Ramsay's dining establishments. Not a let down from the moment we were greeted by a very welcoming and friendly staff/manager, but all throughout the meal, we were delighted by all the food! The burgers/fries were the best we have ever tasted! On leaving, I went up to the manager and thanked her for a wonderful evening, celebrating my oldest daughter's big day. I said the only thing that would make this better, would be to have her meet Chef Ramsay. It turned out, that the famous Chef was actually showing up for this restaurant's anniversary and the topper of a fantastic evening, was the picture Chef Ramsay took with my daughter! Thank you so very much Chef Ramsay for an unforgettable memory!! Would love to visit your Hell's Kitchen some day!
My family and friends ate here to celebrate my birthday and even though it was Thursday during lunch time, the wait time was really long, but it was definitely worth it. We had the best hamburgers we ever had in our lives!  We had the hell's kitchen hamburger, the Euro burger, the American and Blue.  We went back the next day for more lol
We were looking for a delicious cheeseburger that wasn't from a fast food joint or some crazy high end place.  This restaurant is a great choice if you want to split those.. They have a really fun tech menu for drinks.  Didn't get any but was cool to see that.  . I got the blue cheese burger, my girlfriend got a more standard american cheese, and we split the parmesan fries.  The blue was a bit gamey for my liking but was still very good.  Cooked to my requested medium nicely.  It would have been nice to see the fries more crispy, though, they were tasty.  The standard american cheeseburger was what really stood out.  There's something to be said for excellence in simplicity.  That burger had it.. If i could do it again, I would get the standard cheeseburger and try one of their shakes.  . P.S.  If Burgr reads these, you should offer a tasting flight for your shakes.  Pick three minis for the price of one - or something along those lines.
Ummm not as good as I expected. I honestly don't think the burgers were as good, the wings were decent, ketchup was weird, the fish and fritz were great though. Prices are decent. Would recommend it just to try it out but not my personal favorite place for burgers.
I had a Ramsey trifecta in thr beginning of April in Vegas, three Gordon Ramsey resturants in the week. I have been to Burgr three times at this point and can tell you that I still compare all other gourmet burger establishments to this one. Again great staff, excellent atmosphere,  and of course the burgers are the star!  If this is your first time to a Ramsey restaurant I say start here if you are in Vegas. Excellent beers on tap to quench everyones thirst!
Amazing food! My wife and I noticed it walking down the strip, and beings fans of Gordon Ramsey, decided to give it a go. The wait time was about 30 minutes on a Saturday evening. The environment inside the restaurant is a lot of fun, but not too crazy. The waiter was very fast and professional, he knew the menu very well and gave outstanding recommendations. The beer batter onion rings are to die for, cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and comes with a really nice ranch and barbeque dipping sauce. The burgers were amazing. Juicy, but didn't have that nasty, gritty greasy texture that 99.9% of burgers out there have. The chicken burger was very good as well. Finally, top it off with an Oreo shake. The shake was so smooth and creamy, and at the same time wasn't so rich it would make your mouth raw. Overall, or experience it was top of the line, and is definitely on our favorite list for when we come back to Vegas next time!
I have sort of been on a mission to try all of the best burger places in Vegas so I decided to check out Gordon Ramsey's.  I did not care about the long wait or the terrible service or the high price as that is all pretty standard in Vegas....... but I was really disappointed in the food.  Mediocre would be being kind to be honest.  I have found most of the top end burger places to be pretty similar in quality so I was really surprised at how bad it was.  If the positive reviews of this place from others are true it seems at a minimum they are not consistent as no amount of positive thinking could have salvaged my dry little burger with just a sprinkle of Blue Cheese off on one half (just barely enough to justify calling it a Blue Cheese Burger) and an unhappy looking piece of arugula.  It was so dry and bland that I had to specially ask for some catchup (as none is available) just to liven it up.  It was the first time I put catchup on a so called "gourmet" burger in my life.  If I had gotten it  a food court somewhere I would have thought nothing of it...... but it does not even approach some the best gourmet burgers in Vegas.
Omg, the burgers here are DELICIOUS. This is definitely a MUST try. The only reason it got one star was because the hostess was little ms. snooty pants. Our waitress and the food were top notch though. All in all, pricey, but delicious. . . Oh, expect a longer wait if its a party of 2. Thankfully, it was 4 of us and we were seated within 10 minutes on a Wednesday night.
I have an idea....let's make everyone in line stand next to a burning hot fire. Sounds good.
Long wait, over 35 mins wait in line outside of the resturant, I don't understand why they don't have better method for table waiting like giving a pager, when u have a resturant in a casino hotel, isn't a better idea to let people free to hang around n play?? The long wait is not fun. Lots waitress but it took 10 mins for waitress to show up say hi. Slow service. Well, food is really good and in a very good price, 12-16 a good burger is cheap in Vegas. If they fix the wait problem n slow service it's a easy 5 stars for them
Finally!!  I get to eat a burger.  . . It's been 40 days and 40 nights since I had some red meat.  I admit, I am a carnivore and giving up red meat was no easy task.  So what is the first thing I'm craving?  A burger, of course.  So, BurGR it is.  . . Service:  . Unique situation when we arrived for dinner.  It was around 5 PM on Easter and they were closed.  Apparently, BurGR had a small fire the night before and all the inspections kept them from opening on time. Not a big deal to me.  Safety first, right?  Once they opened for business, we were seated right away and our orders were taken fairly quick.  Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks full.  So far, so good. . . The Food:. -American Burger:  I'm old fashion when it comes to a beef burger and decided to keep it simple.  But I also needed to make up for being meatless for so long.  So, I had them add an extra patty.  This was perfect, this was huge.  My burger was cooked medium-well and it was both tasty & juicy.  My only regret...wish I didn't get this with cheese.  The cheese was a little salty and took away from the burger. I managed to eat the whole thing.  Obviously, I was satisfied.  Obviously, I recommend.  . . -Sweet Potato Fries:  This was Ty W's and Lore D's order.  But that didn't stop me from taking a few pieces.  I thought that these were pretty good. They hook up the fries here.  It's big enough for 4.  . . -Truffle Parmesan Fries:  I read reviews that this is really good. I thought that they were just okay.  Maybe it's the batch that we got.  I just thought that the ones that I had were a little under cooked.  Still tasted good, though. . . Overall, I recommend BurGR if you're craving a decent burger.  Price is about average to what you expect to pay in a restaurant on the strip, especially one owned by Gordon Ramsay.  . . PS:  I had another great dinner with Terri R (who happened to come here last year after giving up red meat for 40 days), Terri's teen, Ty W, Lore D, and their son.  I had a great time and we all deMELished our burgers.
Pros: Open late, 2AM on Friday. Good service, food came out at a reasonable time. . . Cons: 30-minute wait at 11:30PM. I ordered the Fish Sandwich and it was fishy so I didn't eat it. My friends were not thrilled about their burgers. I think the only decent burger was the Farm Burger with the duck bacon and fried egg.The fries came with two gourmet ketchups. I cannot remember one but I definitely remember the other. Don't get me wrong, I love indian food but this tomato + curry flavor was all wrong! I have had curry ketchup before but this one was not balanced. So I ordered a regular ketchup and all I could say think was I want some Heinz dangit!. . Final Impression: For the price and the famous name, it didn't live up to the hype.
Excellent Parmesan fries. Great presentation. Excellent setting, but.... Burger meat was very average. My husband tried the veggie burger. If he didn't add toppings at extra cost, it would have been tasteless. A decent place, but nothing fantastic considering how many excellent places there are in Vegas. Average meal without booze is about $25. Be prepared to wait an hour at least. Feel no need to return.
Nothing special bout this burger. The ambiance is nice and the place is usually crowded which usually is a telling sign that the place is good. Business brings business n I thought this would be a great burger! First off, we ordered the Hells burger, jalapeno poppers and truffle fries. Everything was really bland. We had to ask for some sauce to eat with the burger. I ordered medium and my burger came out medium rare. I would say the best thing bout this place is probably the service. Our waitress was really nice and attentive. 1 star for her and 1 star for the ambiance.
This was really a nice meal and is MUCH better than Ramsay's terrible "pub" down the road.  Server was excellent as was the food.  I enjoyed my Farm Burger and the rings and fries were really good too.  Beer selection was great and it was good and cold.  The bun on the burger was perhaps a bit too "bunny" but other than that.... good experience.
All I can say is BEST burger I have ever had. . . I ordered the euro burger and it was so good it was hard to believe I was eating a burger. It was just so good, I also had a side of onion rings. Just a heads up the onion rings or gigantic. . . My bf has the hells burger with a side of Parmesan/truffle fries which he also loved.. . The price was a little high but my burger was well worth it.
We must have had a really "off" experience, based on other reviews.. Food: Ordered pork bao buns, onion rings, farm burger, and euro burger minus cheese. Buns and onion rings were both somewhat bland. Pork belly on bao buns was charred/tough. Ordered burgers medium well and sent them back after they came out rare. When prepared a second time, my husband's was very well done (charred). Mine was made with cheese and had to be sent back a second time. Neither burger had an outstanding flavor profile, we mostly tasted the char-grilled, black outsides of our burgers.. Service: The manager is outstanding. He was very professional and comped our drinks to make up for the mishap with the burgers. Our waitress and another male staff member who assisted were also extremely friendly and apologetic. . 5 stars for service, 1 star for food= 2 overall. . If you want a GREAT burger that is moist and flavorful, try Guy Fieri's new place at the Quad!
From one foodie to another, I mean it when I say this: THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD, YOU GUYS. SO GOOD.. . Originally my group of 4 had planned to come here for dinner around 7. But when we arrived, were told that the wait would be at least an hour long. The good news was that they would text us right before our table was ready, so we were free to walk around the area (tip: shop around the Miracle Mile Shops!) to kill some time. The bad news was, we were on a time crunch, and didn't want to eat dinner in a hurry.. . Instead, we came back for lunch the next day, around 12:30, and we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table! Once seated, we were greeted by our incredibly gracious and knowledgeable waiter who seemed to know the menu inside and out. He recommended the crowd favorites, which include the Farm Burger, the Hell's Kitchen Burger, and the Euro Burger.. . All of the burgers sounded so mouthwatering-ly delicious, but I decided to be daring, and try the Euro Burger. Not everyone's cup of tea I'm sure, since it contains goat cheese, but I thought it was amazing. Anyway, the wait was longer than expected, which is the reason why I docked a star. They didn't seem understaffed on the floor, but it was definitely crowded at the prime lunch hour. It took about 20 minutes for us to receive our food, and maybe that's not exactly an eternity, but it kind of is when you're starving and breathing in that delicious beef aroma.. . When the food finally came, all frustrations diminished. Every bite, from start to finish, was like a little piece of food heaven. Mind you, I don't consider myself a burger person at all (I do like to satisfy my In N Out craving every now and then), but this was definitely the juiciest, most perfectly-cooked burger that I've ever had the privilege of trying. The goat cheese wasn't overpowering at all, and in fact, complimented the burger quite nicely. I also tried the Parmesan truffle fries, which were yummy as well. The fries were good, but what made them amazing, was the truffle aioli dipping sauce. I was pleasantly stuffed by the end of the meal, and on what I can only describe as, a food high. Or food coma. Whatever tickles your fancy.. . Despite the long wait, I think this place is worth the hype, and I'll definitely go out of my way to stop and eat here next time I'm in Vegas.
it was just okay and pricey, to me nothing specail
My boyfriend and I ate here while we were in Vegas a few weeks ago, and we have not stopped thinking/talking about the burgers here since!! . We came in here with very high expectations, since we are avid Kitchen Nightmares watchers and figured this restaurant had the highest standards, and I'm pleased to say every expectation was met. . Our burgers were literally the best burgers we have ever had and we have been craving them ever since. We also loved the fries! The come with 2 delicious dipping sauces, and there was one that I LOVED, but I forget what the name of it was. The prices were also very decent for the quality of food we received. . I HIGHLY recommend BurGR if you're looking for an awesome burger!
Wow.  I am so sad I live so far from this restaurant.  I want to eat here every weekend!!!!  Cool atmosphere.  Wait for two was pretty short.  Make sure you check in with hostess when you have a party of three or more otherwise when you have a table for two you just stand in line and wait your turn for a table. (We only waited about 25 minutes). . Our server was real sweet.  I got the Hell's Kitchen burger with the peppers on the side so it wouldn't be too spicy.  Oh lord.  Love love love!!!!!!!  Highly recommend.  My mom got the Hog Burger.  Don't recommend.  It is cooked one way, really raw, greasy and didn't taste like much :/  . . For desert we had to try the sticky pudding :) it was good.  Not amazing but good.  Our total was $50 for two burgers (no fries), desert, and two drinks.  Not bad I say!!!  . . I will be back BURGR
Amazing food and worth the wait! We had the fun of playing "the game" with our waiter. He asked questions about our preferences and then custom ordered burgers for us. We had the jalapeno poppers for an app... Seriously yummy. My burger had 4 cheeses, mushrooms and avocado... The bun is even amazing. Often long lines to be seated... Come prepared with a cocktail.. :-)
Perfectly crafted, unique burgers.  Usually speciality burgers end up being to moist causing the bun to get soggy. Here, the burger were moist with interesting topping and compiled so perfectly (they don't even fall apart when you bite into them). I personally tried the Hell's Kitchen burger which was a tad spicy. Someone else at my table had the Euro Burger with goats cheese which was excellent. Shakes are amazing as well!
Everything was great. Chicken wings to start. All Burgers were yummy. Service was great. Eric the busser made our experience perfect
I've been dying to try Gordon Ramsey's BurGr!  It was semi hard to find at first because it wasn't on the directory. I love being able to go grab some Fat Tuesdays while waiting for our table. They send you a text when it's ready. SOOO much easier than standing in line HANGRY! It was an hour and half wait at around 3:30pm on a Saturday. After buzzing and chilling, we got the text and was seated immediately! Servers were great and attentive.  . . We ordered the Truffle Parmesan fries which was delicious! Loved the truffle aioli sauce it came with! The ketchup was different. Bun bao was delicious as well but not mind blowing, cause well, we aren't in an authentic Asian restaurant.  . . I got the farm burgr (medium rare) because of the popularity on yelp. Not sure if I was full or too buzzed off of some Fat Tuesday but it was mediocre at best.  The beef was extremely soft, but the burger was a bit bland. Wished I had some aioli in there! . . Would definitely still come back and try a different burger next time!
My first visit to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I was very pleased with everything! Service was impeccable. I ordered a Euro burger mid rare and truffle fries. Every bite was amazing. If you like spicy, try the jalapeno margarita. It's garnished with basil.
This is by far my favorite place to get a burger in Las Vegas. Not only are their burgers amazing, but they have the best truffle fries. I hate going to the strip as a local, but I go way out of my way to visit this place. I wish there were more of them!
This was by far the best burger I have ever had. We had the euro burger and the Hell's Kitchen burger. Both were made to perfection! So tasty and an abundance of flavors!!! We had the parmasean fries which were sooooo delicious. The truffle aoli was amazing. We also had the cherry whiskey lemonade. The drink was  strong and full of flavor. We will be back here for sure!!!
Have been to this place three times now and have enjoyed it each time. We started with the poppers which are amazing. I had the fresh chili dawg which was wonderful and huge. My dad order the fish sandwich which was equally as good. I would recommend this place.
Seriously? 4 star average out of 1515 Yelpers? I guess most of the peeps giving the BurGR 4 stars are used to eating leftovers or frozen microwave foods. I don't mind standing in line for 30 mins on a Tuesday night at 8:30 pm. I don't mind waiting 45 minutes for the burger everyone loves the Farm burger.. Just prove me it's worth the wait. . . It doesn't even taste on the level of Cheesecake Factory's burger which is $4 cheaper! After being able to seat then waited 45 minutes! Really? For a burger that they just added sunny side up egg and duck bacon? Their lucky they don't hire chubby waitresses. The servers gave great customer service so far. But for an ordinary burger like the Farm burger and Hells kitchen burger. Don't waste your time. They weren't even warm when it got to us.. . My nephew who ordered the Hells Kitchen burger which is supposed to be hot or spicy that I recommended according to "Yelp reviews," told me it's not even hot and it tasted ordinary LOL! One common word to describe..Overrated.
Im just gonna say it. Best burger ever. Got the hells kitchen one rare and it was heaven. HEAVEN! !!
Absolutely LOVE this place. Have been going here for my birthday the last few years and I can say that I have never been disappointed, EVER. The service is so awesome and the food is even BETTER. Longer wait times, but it is worth it for something this delicious. If I could give them a million stars, I would!
The food here is fantastic.. . We started off with the jalapeno poppers, sweet potato fries, and the truffle fries for appetizers. The dips for the fries were delicious! I really liked the vanilla powdered sugar on the sweet potato fries because the sugary sweetness was such a unique addition to FRIES. The poppers came nicely plated in these shot-glass dishes and were tasty as well.. . My friend and I exchanged the halves of two burgers so we could try more variety. I had both the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Farm Burger. The patties were cooked to a lovely medium rare, the buns were fresh, and the individual ingredients for both burgers blended together nicely. In my opinion, I liked the Hell's Kitchen Burger slightly better though because of its lighter and more refreshing flavor. Don't get me wrong, the Farm Burger was great in its own way. You can really taste the duck bacon along with the savory egg and cheddar combo.. . The service was very attentive and er.. pretty attractive in its own way haha. . If I ever come back to Las Vegas (hopefully soon!), I'm totally coming back!
I assume Gordon Ramsey himself reads every single one of these reviews. . How could he not?. He cares about the quality he throws his name behind, right?. Because if it sucks balls, then his rep as a bad ass celebrity chef is in risk. . So, hello Gordon, I think you're a neat fellow. . . I will now switch to my best British impersonation, stolen from the great Monty Python. . Those guys were also neat. . (Just pretend this is written in British style English, ok? Thanks.). . The quality of this fine establishment is excellent.. I had the farm burger, with "duck breat bacon, fried eggs, and something else.". Maybe therewas nothing else, just those first two things. . Regardless, it was a good burger. . . But like all things Vegas, the presentation is prettier than the substance. . The service was rushed and slightly rude. . Not to me though. . All the girls are nice to me, because, well, who knows. . But the gentlemen flanking me at the bar apparently were asking too many questions and/or the waitress was having a bad day. . I laughed at their failure to please the server. . . And also, there's the issue of price. . $24 for a fancy burger and fries?. Thus the reason for 3 stars instead of 4. . If I'm paying $24 for a burger, I'm expecting the greatest burger ever made. . And this ain't it. . Tasty, but not the greatest. . At least gimme grass fed beef, or a lap dance. . That last one would probably be more appropriate. . . Go here and wait for an hour plus, take pictures with the Gordon Ramsey photo, and embrace the typical Vegas experience.
Amazing burger..had the Hell's Kitchen burger with truffle fries..best fries I have ever had, meat was very juicy and tender..recommend to everyone
Had a wonderful dinner before seeing Britney Spears. The burger and salads were fantastic. My only regret is being too full to have dessert. Don't worry Gordon we will be back. Happy Customers :)
I give this place 3.5 stars. I marked it a four rather than a three because ofthat friggin awesome push pop dessert. So I arrived on Friday at around 6pm and there was a line along the restaurant at Planet. We ended up waiting a good 45 minutes before getting seated and you can definitely avoid that huge line at weird times like in the morning or late dinner. . . Farm burger- $15 for duck breast bacon and fried egg. This burger was alright. I shared this and it was enough since we ordered fries. The egg is barely existent and the meat was ok. I guess I am not much of a burger person but when something is good, I know wassup. This wasnt quite up to par.. . Truffle Parmesan Fries- Hmm nothing special about these again. The fries were a bit soggy and I just wanted crispy. THere is some cheese sprinkled on top and there is truffle sauce and ketchup. I opted for the ketchup so that was a waste in ordering this.. . Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops- OMG bombbbb. This thing saved my meal and I was soo happy. It comes with two for $7 and at first I thought it was weird to be pudding but it really just is peanut butter ice cream with cake pieces in between. Delicious!! I love peanut butter and cake so these were the perfect size and so yummy. I wanted to get another round before I left for Vegas but that would be too gluttonous.. . **TIPS**. 1) Come at awkward times if you do not want to wait 45min-1 hour. I didnt see a line around 11am or 9pm or so.. 2) Do without the fries and get the Push Up Pops!!!. 3) Enjoy!
