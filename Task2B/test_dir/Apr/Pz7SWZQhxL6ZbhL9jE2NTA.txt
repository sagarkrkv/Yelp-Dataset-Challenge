Wow. We had dinner here at the end of our honeymoon. What a spectacular place. The whole style is so modern and the view is spectacular. The service is what you would expect from such a nice place, our server was very kind and helpful with any questions we had about the menu. We had such a relaxing dinner and never felt rushed to get out. . . But those are just details. The food is what really is just amazing. I had the cod which was to die for. The flavor was amazing and cooked to perfection. My husband had the filet Mignon and that too was just fabulous. The deserts are also exquisite. They have ice cream that they make in house....wow just delicious. Overall this place was fantastic...not disappointed at all. . . If your up for great food, great views and a nice romantic/expensive dinner this is the place for you.
This is a review from 9-2013. We went to vegas for my daughters birthday like every year since she turned 21 (now 27) I made reservations at Joel Robuchon, Alize, and Mix and honestly taste wise, Mix was my favorite! oops I hate to even say that but it had what I expected French food to have which was lots of tasty sauces. Robuchon was in its own class and I will review it later. But I would recommend trying Mix. . we had the tasting menu which at that time was a gnocchi, lobster and filet and it was all awesome. the problem with trying to write review 6 months later is I cant remember everything but I do know it was my favorite.. The place is beautiful but they sat us in the back behind one of the huge seats so our view sucked. Service was ok.
If you have the tasting menu, you will be absolutely stuffed when you leave. I have never had portions this large for a tasting menu. That being said, the wine pairings are the most skillful that I've ever experienced. The view is amazing, romantic and the chandelier is OMG.
Here in Las Vegas to celebrate my birthday, and my wife and I along with another couple went to the Mix Lounge at the top of The Hotel at Mandalay Bay.  We went after dinner, so this review is just for the lounge.  The setting is incredible; the views alone are worth a visit.  It was mid week, so it wasn't busy, as I think it might be on weekends, given the techno dance music being  played.  Service was good and the cocktails were just what we ordered.
Great service, delicious filet mignon with tuffles on top, so tender it melted in your mouth.  Also shared the rib-eye which was flavorful and perfectly done.  I like the meat a little pink in the center and had it medium-rare.  We had the chocolate souffle with pistachio ice cream for dessert and if you are a chocolate fan, I highly recommend this.  Also got warm madelines to dip in melted hazzelnut sauce at the end of the meal compliments of our waiter.  Beautiful ambiance and great night!
As far as date spots go, this would be perfect in Vegas.  You can't beat the views and the interior of the dining room.. . As far as dining experience, the food is quite incredible.  I would definitely go with at least one fish dish.  From the classics, I had the chef's striped bass.  Even if it came without the squid/octopus and it's base, I would have still loved it.  Same goes for the halibut.  I find it amazing how the chefs can cook such a big piece of fish so evenly and so moist.  . . Top the above dishes with the dungeness crab salad and some gnocchi, you will be quite satisfied and full.  Enjoy!. . Why 4 stars?  The service is a bit casual.  The servers are pleasant, but the service doesn't equate to what the customer is paying.  Items are missing, the staff is not completely attentive.  I have a feeling the chef is going for this feel to make it seem unpretentious, but I'm not sure if it's the best model.
Totally amazing view that is only surpassed by the incredible level of service you will receive.   Our personal favorites are Stephaniewho has a great personality and truly understands that there is an art to providing perfect service, being very attentive and greeting you with a warm smile.  The manager, Tram, is likewise incredible. She will greet you with a smile, take time to talk with you and see how your experience is progressing and will help out when needed.  The food is outstanding with the braised short rib tacos being out of this world, amazingly tender and delicious short rib meat in a corn tortilla with chopped onion and cilantro combined with a squeeze of lime tops this marvel of flavor off.  There is a candy bar desert that is equally on the "to die for" scale.  Decadently rich hand made candy bar similar to a Snicker's bar with an amazing coconut sorbet that cleanses the palate   You have not been to Vegas until you have been to The Mix
Excellent meal. I had lobster curry - fantastic flavors, gobbled it up.. Hubby had lamb which was delicious. We dined al fresco, overlooking the strip, 64 flights up. Awesome views. Nice night out! Would go back.
Wow! This restaurant/lounge is amazing. It's located in "The Hotel" tower at the Mandalay Bay and it's an amazing french restaurant/lounge. I had dinner there - steak and foie gras. It was excellent.... . I'm gluten free but had a bite or two of their french banquette with salted butter - yumm! Steak came with mashed potatoes drizzled with truffle oil. The foie gras was amazing. We can't order it here in California so it was my treat :). . I had them make me raspberry martini and it was delicious too. The decor is spectacular and the views are breathtaking. . . They have a lounge next to the restaurant which is cool to see if you just want drinks. . . My foie gras appetizer, steak with mushrooms, mashed potatoes and 1 martini was around $150. Which is a bit expensive for one person. . . They greeted me with a glass of champagne which was very nice. This is 5-star dinning all the way... You won't be disappointed.
Out of the restaurants we ate at while visiting Vegas, this by far was our favorite.  We arrived a bit early to find out there is a lounge area on the top floor with somewhat discounted appetizers and drinks.  We had the beef medallions and short rib tacos.  The tacos were my favorite!. . For dinner we ordered the 2 prixe fixed menus. My husband ordered the lamb and I ordered the gnocchi/lobster/filet steak.  The gnocchi I was not a fan of but the other courses were fantastic, especially the lobster.  Dessert was very good too.  Mine was the chocolate candy bar.  I prob would have chosen the chocolate souffle though if that had been an option on the prixe fixed menu.  . . The best parts of the meal was the view and the attentive waiters/service staff though.  It is stunning up on the top floor of The Hotel.  When the sun went down it was a million dollar view.  I will post a pic because words can't even describe how awesome it is!  . . When the check came it was over $300 with tip for a full meal and drinks, but totally worth it in my opinion!
Touting itself as French cuisine with an American influence, this restaurant sits in an enviable location at the very tippy top of THEhotel in Las Vegas.. . My first trip to Las Vegas was due to an IT Expo going on, and we had been sent out armed with a list of places to try and restaurants to visit, with miX being a regularly recommended location.. . Some of our friends had decided to meet up with us for a few days during our Vegas trip, and they were equally excited to eat at miX for the first time.. . From the discreet glass elevator that shoots up the outside of The Hotel and offers a changing view of Vegas, to the stunning decor inside the varied bar and eating areas, to the panoramic view from the restaurant that comes alive as the sun goes down and the Vegas lights come up, everything at miX is designed to be an experience that will leave you with a fantastic impression.. . The staff are softly spoken and perform at the caliber you expect from an Alain Ducasse restaurant: quick on their feet, taking the time to discuss the menu without rushing any decisions, respectfully disappearing if more time is needed and knowledgeable about everything on offer and nicely versed on the wine list and suitable pairings.. . Between everyone at our table we sampled the following:. * Complimentary bread basket sampler accompanied by perfectly spreadable butter studded with peanuts.. * We ordered Dungeness Crab Salad with palm hearts, guacamole & cilantro, Shrimp Cocktail with horseradish and Spring Baby Vegetable Salad with an herby basil dressing as Starters for the table to share.. * 2x Filet Mignon Rossini with foie gras & a black truffle sauce. * 1x Roasted Maine Lobster au Curry with basmati rice. * 1x Cod Brandade with lemon, capers, brown butter, croutons and fried parsley. * We ordered Fork Crushed (the fancy way of saying expensively mashed) Potatoes, Creamy Spinach and Sauteed Green Asparagus as sides to share.. * Complimentary Madeleines (which were absolutely perfect) with a chocolate dipping sauce for everyone after dinner to bide us over while we decided on what to try for dessert.. * 1x miX Candy Bar with a textured coconut & lime sorbet. * 1x chocolate cherry pudding with chocolate crisps & black cherries. . The food was fantastic, but at miX prices I would expect it to do everything but dance on the table while singing a show tune.  . . Everything was perfectly cooked, seasoned and flavoured: . * The Steaks were done exactly as requested, although the Foie Gras lacked the impact I was hoping for and tasted just like any other goose liver pate I've had (it was my first time trying it and I was a little underwhelmed). * The Cod was glorious and the accompanying sauce was perfect. * The Lobster Curry was phenomenal. . However, as someone with a raging, barely controlled sweet tooth the dessert options were a little limited but still of a superb quality nonetheless.. . The wines suggested by our Server were superb and all the cocktails we had at the bar afterwards were excellent.. . On the way out I noticed what appeared to be the smallest dance floor in the world tucked away almost as an afterthought, however at a Vegas altitude where every square metre of space comes at a premium I don't blame them for compromising their dance floor for extra dining space.. . I get the feeling that the staff were specifically chosen to bring a warm touch to what had the potential to be a very pretentious experience.  This is definitely a restaurant to try at least once, and I recommend that you try to time your visit around the sunset as this will give you a memorable view of Vegas.
We had dinner here last night and went for the executive tasting menu by Alan Ducasse with paired wine. Now this was a fine dining experience at this Michelin starred restaurant and not cheap at $175 per person. . . The restaurant boasts beautiful views being on the 50 something floor, even the ladies restroom had a floor to ceiling picture window in it, stunning. . . We had an amuse bouche of broccoli puree and sweet pickled vegetables followed by 4 courses. My husband had gnocchi with wild mushrooms and asparagus, Maine lobster, fillet mignon with foie gras then rum Armagnac then madeleines and dipping chocolate.. . I had a vegetarian alternative menu also starting with the gnocchi, followed by a warm vegetable salad then swede pickled veg and mushroom tapenade rum Armagnac and madeleines. . . That was all very delicious and we were totally spoilt with the food which us he'd our taste buds to the extreme with new flavours and combinations. Not everything was to our tastes like my husband couldn't take the fois gras. . . The one star was reduced more with the service. We were left waiting for a while at the front for a server to seat us and we got the menus but they were whisked away before we got to look at them when they realised that we had the executive tasting menu pre-booked, I asked for one back to read the full listings of each course to savour it more. They did talk through each course but so quickly that a couple of times I asked how that would be cooked etc. . . The door to the balcony tables kept blowing open with the wind which sent our pristine starched white table cloth flapping and the servers running to close it many times! . . The decor was white minimal with glass spheres suspended by wires that reminded me of jelly fish. . . I really enjoyed the experience and the food was first class.
