The view was stunning from our window seat and the Bellagio fountains were stunning, but that was the highlight of the night, not the food.. The main of filet mignon with foie gras was average. The steak was cooked perfectly but it was full of sinew and had no marbalisation. The steak I had at Wolfgang for $48 apposed to $79 here was far better. They did redeem themselves with solid desserts. I really felt the prices were really outrageous and did not justify the quality.. Food 6/10 service 8/10 decor 7.5/10
It was our first visit. We got lost, it was so hard to find this place but it was worth it. Very pricey but delicious French dish. The restaurant is up towards the building, we had to take the elevator by the receptionist. The bathrooms had employees serving us with paper towels, offering perfumes and waiting for tips. The service was really good and friendly. . . We had the Beef Wellington and roasted Chicken and Potato Gratin. They were all good. But I didn't like the potato Croquette. The desert souffle was good also. Prepare to have a fat bill even for a couple. I spent more than $300. Half a dozen roses cost $30 and a small photo cost $25. I would still comeback coz I likedthe food.
This was my second visit and as always the ambiance here is upscale and romantic.  A good vantage point of Vegas and if you're in the right spot you get a marvelous view of the Bellagio fountains.  However, unless only 2 people are dining, the vantage point is mediocre for the fountains.. . Dinner was delicious.  We only ordered entrees as we had to run to a show.. . Beef Wellington:  Takes approximately 30 minutes but was worth it.  Very delicious at medium rare but make sure to ask for the sauce on the side as it can be a bit overwhelming.  . . Roasted Chicken was delish.  It's a large portion and the veggies were cooked just right.. . Salmon and the duck were also very good.. . Sides:  . Classic Au Gratin was dry. . Creamed corn was not good.  It was like a creamy polenta and I hate polenta.  Blah!!. Creamed spinach and mushrooms were a hit for the entire table!!. . The downer for this restaurant is the service.  Most of the wait staff looks confused and or rushed.  A large table next to us definitely wanted to have a good time and celebrate however, the waiter was clueless.  Our waitress was not friendly and was very curt and short with us.  A real shame for such a beautiful restaurant with good food.. . I have to say that I truly enjoyed the food here however, based upon the experience with the waitstaff, the Eiffel Tower Restaurant will not be at the top of my list for a nice dinner out.  There are too many other options in Vegas that have great food and great service.
Bonjour!. . Welcome to my review! Me and the hubs got a chance at a date night thanks to grandpa watching my little monster. I carefully selected this place. As someone who lived in Europe for 2 years and have visited Paris twice I would say the Eiffel tower is much bigger. haha! But in all reality it really is a super cool replica!. . Even our waiter was French (maybe he was faking it, after all have you hear Rick's voice from the Walking Dead?? CRAZY!) The steak was amazing (and I'm a Texan y'all!) and the potatoe croquettes were to die for! The creme de la crop was the Creme brulee. I am still dreaming about it...(sorry honey). . The drink was awesome, don't get me wrong (pink something??) but $19?!! I coulda gotten one of those yard stick margaritas for that (which I did after, to show my classiness) . . Did I mention you can see the Belagio fountains perfectly?? It's pretty amazing. We will definitely go back here. Next time I will 86 the drink and save the $ for gambling (or a second creme brulee, who knows??) Oui Oui!!
I always love coming to the Eiffel Tower Resturant. Have to take an elevator to the resturant from the casino which opens up to the kitchen then around the corner to open resturant overlooking the strip. Food is very good and the wine is what you would expect from a French resturant. Great for romance or business.
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! If I could go everyday I would :) . . One of the best dining experiences I've ever had.  Everything about this restaurant is exceptional: service, food, decor, view, ambience....perfection!. . I ordered the roasted chicken; so moist, flavorful, fulfilling in every way possible.  THAT is how a chicken is cooked, lovely!. . My mother got the filet mignon; it was exceptional!  The drinks are also fantastic!. . The "Autumn in Paris" martini is a must!  I usually don't like Martini's at all, but the flavorful depth of it was too good. . . Dessert is an experience in itself.  Definitely try the Pistachio Souffle! Fluffy, light, it would just melt so delicately in your mouth.  One of the best souffle I've tasted.  . . Our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly.  Gave great recommendations of pairings and other suggestions.. . This is a MUST when you come to Vegas, you will not regret it!  It is pricey, but hey, you're in VEGAS, indulge a little bit!. . Ask for seating near the window with the view of the Bellagio....at night they have a splendid water works show with lights....incredible experience!. . This place is definitely as good as it gets! :)
Holy CRAPOLA!. . Ate here again on April 17, 2014.  The food was just as good if not better....but damn the service was impeccable.  I would drink some of my tea and would think to myself...."hmmm...I think I need more tea" and a guy would be there with another bottle before I even ask for it.  I would think to myself "hmmm.....it would be nice for a little taste compliments of the chef" and whamo...right in front of me.  I have no idea what it was that they gave me...some infused something or other...but it was amazing...and free....and compliments of the chef.. . Then we were prepared to order dinner.  I had the snapper before so I didn't want to get that again...although it was amazing.  I wanted to expand and try something new.  I saw Arctic Char on the menu.  Strange name....Arctic = Cold and Char = Hot.  I have no idea what type of fish this will be....and once again the waiter says "you probably are not familiar with Arctic Char....it  tastes a little like a trout and salmon mixed together."  Well I be damned if it didn't taste exactly like a trout and salmon mixed together.  It was great.  The chef even seared the skin to make it crispy...which is extremely hard to do without drying out the fish.. . Then dessert time.  I ordered the creme brule and my fiance ordered some banana thing.  She asked me if it would be good...and I just said "come on...stop asking stupid questions...of course it will unless you are allergic to bananas."  We inquired about the gelato briefly with the waiter and he told me the gelato is great.  I still wanted my creme brule and she wanted the banana...so gelato will have to wait I guess.. . Guess what!?  They send us out this big painter's pallete dish full of one scoop gelato flavors...about 10 of them or so...as a compliment for visiting the restaurant again!  Awesome right?  . . I am not a high-roller by any stretch of the imagination, and the restaurant is not affiliated with Caesar's entertainment.  I imagine they rent or have purchased the space in the Eiffel Tower.  What they do is they make great food and have great service.  I will say they have the greatest service...and that is a FACTUAL statement.  I have visited other fine dining restaurants in Vegas and elsewhere and they cannot hold a candle to this place.  They treat you as though you are the only customer...but they do not treat you as a customer.  They treat you as a friend that appreciates great food and they know how to deliver.  Without a doubt this is the place I will always visit when in Vegas.
Driving in to Vegas, I e-mailed Sharon to make a last minute special request at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  Sharon was extremely helpful and took care of our reservation. When we arrived to fulfill one of our family traditions in Vegas, we were warmly greeted by the check in desk and they knew exactly who we were and what we were celebrating.  Gary our Maitre D was wonderful and took such good care of us, checking in on a regular basis to see if we were enjoying our evening.. The Souffles! All 3 of them were spectacular!. Thank you Sharon B. and Gary for making our first night in vegas wonderful and starting our vacation off so well!
I don't know where to start! My girlfriend and I were in Vegas attending the Electric Daisy Carnival which coincided with our 2 year anniversary. Immediately we started looking for the finest restaurants Las Vegas Boulevard had to offer. We tossed around ideas, and drew up a list. The Eiffel Tower restaurant had  fantastic price point that didn't degrade service or quality. Of course we dressed up for the occasion, however I did note that some patrons where wearing beach shorts and t-shirts. Not really the kind of ambiance I'd like when spending around $400 including tip. But alas I dined like royalty and enjoyed my stay. I started off with the Heirloom Tomato, California Burrata, Balsamic Aspic, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil salad. It was beyond words and more than just a salad. The flavors that my palate were introduced to were unbelievable. My lovely girlfriend went with the Warm Maine Lobster, White Wine Braised Baby Leeks, Mustard Vinaigrette  that was sublime. Tender, succulent and bursting with flavor. A Light size portion that is more about taste and saving room for the next course. For my entree I went with the Char Broiled Filet Mignon, Rossini Style, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce. One of the best meals I've ever had the privilege to enjoy. Definitely worth the $79 it was priced at. Ill include a picture of this wonderful bit of paradise. I was hesitant to try foie gras but my curiosity was rewarded with an delicacy  that is no longer available in Los Angeles. It was cooked to perfection and looked as immaculate as it was delectable. My girlfriend had the Prime Aged Bone-In Ribeye, Caramelized Onions and added the black truffle sauce that complimented it exquisitely. A magnificent slab of meat suitable for a king or queen in this case. Bought some cocktails that seemed overpriced but the craftsmanship put into concocting them is well worth the steep price. The servers go out the way to make you feel comfortable, and for the time that you are there like you were as important as the president. Never did I feel hovered over or stared at as if I didn't belong. My visit was a little less than a year ago and to this day 4/23/2014 I am still raving about it. We are going back to EDC Las Vegas this year and are struggling to find another restaurant to match the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. And the killer view of the fountains and strip is more romantic than can be described. Definitely a meal that will stand out for a long time. Adieu!
Wow, what an amazing dining experience...worth the wait to get a fountain view table.  Our server was very knowledgable and helpful but could be perceived as a bit elitist if your baseline is Bennigans enthusiasm. Appetizers of scallops and the crab salad set the tone perfectly for the evening. We had the duck breast and the "Faux gras" for entrees and I would definitely order again.  The souffle is a must to round out a wonderful evening.
I booked the 5pm dinner so my newly wed husband and I could get a window seat and watch the fountains. The only upsetting moment I had, was realizing the day was too windy and the fountains would not go off. We put that behind us as we ordered our cocktails. Let me tell you the Eiffel Affair is to die for! Fresh fruit in the bottom of my glass just soaked up the liquor. Yum! I ordered the scallops...delightful. The highlife was ordering the veal medallions. So glad I ordered that, they were so moist. My husband ordered the aged NY steak mid rare. Looked superb. I also ordered a customized cake (very lovely) months ago and I chose to get the picture. Very glad, everything went well and was a great experience.
Great view, drinks are pricey at the upstairs bar there.
We don't get the hype.  Really.  We have some experience with fine dining and it did not blow us out of the water.  Maybe our expectations were high because it was recommended.  Maybe we're getting snobby.  Who knows?!  Yeah, the service was good, the food good, the view nice, but for $400 for 2 (with tip)--- you expect that at the very least.  But to end on a positive note, my highlight was the foie gras on my filet mignon and my hubby loved his chocolate souffle.
