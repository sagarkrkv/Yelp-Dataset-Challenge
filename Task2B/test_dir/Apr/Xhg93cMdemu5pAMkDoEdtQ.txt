Note:  this review is pretty much solely for Serendipity's most famous item - the frozen hot chocolate drink.  I ordered it through their take-out window on the strip.. . Overhyped and overpriced.  I've seen this place on various food and travel shows for years, but that frozen hot chocolate just isn't worth it.  While most of Las Vegas is comically overpriced, this fits the bill with what is essentially a chocolate milk shake costing you ELEVEN DOLLARS.  Is it really any better than a really good milkshake somewhere else?  No, it is not.  Because I'm an ice cream pig, I had a Ben & Jerry's shake earlier in the day (don't judge me), and that overpriced $7 shake was still better than this.  It's just plain nothing special.  Like much of Vegas, it's a hyped up novelty with little substance to it.
This review is pretty much just for the frozen hot chocolate I tried and all the delicious looking food around me as I ate it.  I had the peanut butter one and as a peanut butter fanatic it was soooo good!. I also tried their walk up ordering outside and I was less than impressed with everything there.  If you go, go inside and order a frozen hot chocolate!  It is a bit pricey though
I've heard a lot of good things about this but I wasn't impressed. I went during lunch to the outdoor portion. I think the food was overpriced. I think I paid 11 bucks for just an average salad. They have outdoor seating but there was bird poop on all the seats and the birds fly everywhere while you eat. I'd still like to try the frozen hot chocolate, but other than that I don't plan on going back.
Food wise:. The one stars for the frozen hot chocolate, which was the best part of the whole visit.. . Staff wise: . Worse customer service I have yet to experience.
We usually stop by here when in vegas  and try something different each time  we go.. . The deserts of course are what people come for and they are pretty good most of them anyway. But they have some really good food and its in really huge portions.. . Last time we had the deep fried orea sundae which was pretty good except they made the deep fried oreos to crispy with what ever cereal they rolled it in.  They tend not to bring the desert right out after it is made which leaves it a little on the dethawed side which i wish they didnt quite do but oh well.. . This place had good food and desserts and the pricing is very good too. Can't wait to try something new next time.  Also can't wait to sit outside and enhoy the area cause it is actulaly quiter outside than inside even though it is on the strip.
Great desserts, but overpriced of course due to the name.. . Breakfast portions are absolutely HUGE so be prepared to share! . . The frozen hot chocolate is awesome, highly recommended. Try to get there early or you'll end up having to wait a long time!
Let's get one thing straight, I'm a Vegas local. Like many Vegas locals, I avoid The Strip whenever possible. A few people at my work were headed to Caesar's Palace's Cheesecake Factory when someone suggested we try Serendipity 3 instead. Because we were on The Strip, I knew that we would be treated like tourists and pay tourists prices. No shocker there:-) . . I was pleasantly surprised that our group was seated right away in their patio area. Our waiter was pleasant and even joked around with us a bit. He was quick with drink orders and recommendations on the menu. . . The menu was extensive. There were plenty of food options as well as a ton of choices for desserts. We were there for dinner, and I wasn't feeling all that hungry, and I asked the waiter what he'd recommend; he stated that The Vegas Dog was one of his favorite items. I went with that. . . The Vegas Dog is a foot-long hotdog with nacho cheese and jalapenos. When the dog came out, I was surprised by the awkward shape of the dish that seemed to reach the middle of the table and disturb my fellow diners. This thing is so massive that picking it up and eating it with your hands would have been challenging! I forked and knifed it. The bun to meat ratio was way off. Towards the middle of the meal, I got sick of how much bread there was and decided to eat just the dog from there on out. Although the meat was cooked thoroughly and there was a good amount of cheese on top, I couldn't get over the canned jalapenos. There were only a few slices of jalapenos, and it was surprised to learn that for $17 you weren't getting a freshly chopped topping. The taste of the peppers was mild and soggy. Also, the meat isn't flavored well. Besides the shear size of the dog, it tasted like any basic-brand hotdog you can find in your local grocery store. I would stick to Hebrew National or even BallPark Franks if you want some flavor in the meat. . . As a local, I was glad to have good service at a tourist restaurant, but if I do return to this place, I'll be sure to stick with ice cream.
Food was good, on the pricey side. Service was ok. The frozen chocolate was good but not as what people have hyper it too much about. It just tastes like a rich chocolate smoothie with overload of whip cream on top with some chocolate chips. I asked for hot sauce and I was given a cholula, but I would prefer Tabasco. It gets really busy here. Food was ok but nothing too special.
SerendipiDONT. . Sunday brunch. Worst restaurant experience of my life! We were served coffee & proceeded to wait an hour and a half- with many interactions with waitress & manager- and ended up leaving without having been served our food!
I typically like this place but I don't like the limited weekend brunch menu served until 2pm.
I want to give this place a 3.5. . I honestly think that I was just really hyped up about eating here because of the movie Serendipity my college roommate watched that movie at least once every few months -_-. . Anyways I got the frozen hot chocolate. Shared it with my bestie on my birthday. so freaking romantic!!!! It was pretty good but I think it was definitely hyped up so I was kind of like... meh its good but not extraordinarily delicious. . . I also got the mac and cheese I believe. You cannot go wrong with baked mac and cheese. The only way you can go wrong actually is if you don't give me enough cheese! RAWR! Super filling I saved half for drunchies after xs that night hehehe. . . ON TOP OF THAT. my friends got me a red velvet slice of cake that was humongous and got the waiter to sing for me.. i think. I hate it when I get sung happy birthday at restaurants. Like... what do I do? clap along? sing along? where do I look? too many thoughts! lol. anyways. overall a 3.5 experience. :). . Down to come back but would rather try some other well known food options/ buffet places next time.
This is a great place to get food on the strip...me & husband have been there a couple times whilst in town... . Iv had the crab cake sandwich - great, huge portion of crab and delicious. . Iv also had the egg white omelette - also served with amazing home fries. . My husband has had the French toast log - huge yumminessssss served with eggs & bacon . . We also tried their signature frozen hot chocolates...they are amazing!!! Defiantly worth it! . . The portions are huge  and keep u full up, reasonably prided for the strip and the atmosphere is good. . The service is great, we have been in Judy's section both times and she is so attentive & given us great service.
We like Serendipity. Yes it is overpriced, I mean $11 for a frozen hot chocolate but it is soo good. Thisis my 2nd time dining at this location and it wasn't that great, we ended up with food poisoning. We ordered the nachos as a appetizer. It came with black beans,  crusty old looking ground beef that must have been sitting somewhere for hours and cheese. The small amount of meat on the nachos had that dark crusted over color on the top and we should have known from that point on but they were $14 so we ate about 1/3 of the order. We both ordered the up the skirt steak, it was pretty good but again we both ended up with food poisoning -though I can't say if it was the steak or the nachos that got us. I tried the green tea frozen drink and it was way too sweet for me but they were kind and switched it out for me.  Our server was nice, he was really busy so another guy (mgr?) took our order for us and brought us water which was nice. I don't know, our bill was about $90 with tax and tip for 2 entree's, 1 appetizer and 2 hot chocolates and that was with their TR's discount. I would only come back for the frozen hot chocolate, after the night my bf and I spent in the restroom we will stay far away from the food. I will say that last year we had the white pineapple sangria and it was the best I've had, so I guess I only like their beverages.. . **update - ok after looking at the pictures of other peoples nachos ours looked nothing like that, I am convinced it was the nachos that got us sick. Maybe they gave us a old order that had gotten returned or cancelled or that was sitting because ours certainly didn't look anything like other peoples pictures. Ugh :(
From food to desserts, this place rocks!
The food is presented with much creativity, the most you can spend on a dish is $30 (not including a drink) but what i liked best about it was the atmosphere and the location. Some how the decor makes you feel like a kid again. When i go I usually I tend to get the most accommodating waiters who are very pleasant. Definitely a place to go to.
This has become my favorite place. I am a major breakfast person. The stuff they have on their menu is so fun, creative and delicious that I don't see how anyone couldn't find something they love. The last time I went I finally tried the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate they're famous for because I had to see what made it so different. It was extraordinary and definitely tasted like hot chocolate! I had the Sinners and Saints Breakfast Log that basically has everything you could ever want on a very delicious French toast log. Beautiful surroundings when sitting outside, right in the heart or the Vegas Strip and just an all around great place. I will say that whenever we went it took a long time to get someone to our table but they were always friendly and it has always been worth the wait. Love it!
I've been here twice but took a break from reviews since I wasn't getting paid for them.  The food is overall good. Desserts fantastic don't like the price of a shake, but the frozen hot chocolate is good.  I'm not a big onion ring eater but they are bomb.  Portions are big so the price balances out.  It's hard to go wrong here and service is swell.
There was a little bit of line.  Came here for frozen hot chocolate for $14.00, for small glass. Too sweet and overprice!  Didn't really like the looks of then food from other people's table.  Portion was huge and nothing really stands out.  I guess people who likes quantity than quality love to go there.  I think this place is overrated.  Thanks!
Cute and girly restaurant! Finally had the chance to try this restaurant out the last time I was in Vegas. I originally wanted to go and try out their popular sundaes that everyone raves about! When we got there, it was so crowded such a long wait! Prob waited almost an hour... . . Finally got seated and then ordered the onion ring tower. It was huge! Dipping sauces were good. My bf and I could not finish it. Then my entree I ordered an ahi salad. I didn't really like it because of how the ahi tuna had sesame seeds ( I think it was) on the outer edges. I spent some time having to pick out all the seeds. We were too full to order their desserts. Next time if I do return, def ordering something else and getting the sundae dessert!
I ordered the frozen hot chocolate and it was excellent. It was perfectly chilled and very refreshing. The chocolate had a nice rich flavor without being overly sweet. The whip cream wasn't overly sweet as well and the fresh chocolate shaving are an excellent touch. This was an exceptional drink that is overpriced.... If you are ever near a WAWA go there and get one of their frozen drinks. While not as sophisticated as this offering it is almost as good and will only cost you around $4 with tax. Message to Serendipity: The frozen hot chocolate is excellent and should be enjoyed by the masses, please drop the price to $7 and I will add the fourth star. You know you want me to give you that extra star.
I was in Vegas with my family for the Bar & Night Club Convention a few weeks ago and we ate here the last day we were there. . . If the weather permits, I would advise sitting outside because it's stuffy and uncomfortable inside. It was literally like walking into a sauna and we all opted to wait 15 extra minutes for an outside table (it was a nice day so, naturally, the patio had a longer wait). . . Our server was really good as it was pretty crowded and I saw other people having issues with getting served. In fact, one couple got up and left after sitting there for 20 minutes without even having drinks on the table. With that being said, this place is probably hit or miss with service and we happened to be some of the lucky ones. Too bad I can't remember our server's name, otherwise I would totally recommend him! . . The food was actually pretty damn good. I would recommend the grilled cheese with tomato basil soup and the crab cake sandwich. Those were the winners at our table. My dad had a steak sandwich which he really enjoyed except he said it needed some kind of sauce. You can't have a steak sandwich with no horseradish sauce! All they had in their kitchen was A1, so that was a bit disappointing but he did say the meat was cooked perfectly and very tender. The desserts were epic, of course, and we could only eat about a fourth of the portions (out of the five of us, we ordered 4 desserts). BUT, they were all delicious so I would definitely come back here JUST for the world famous desserts. . . I gave three stars because of the seemingly shoddy service that we, luckily, weren't apart of and also because they really need better ventilation inside. Otherwise, it was a good time!
I've tried to eat here many times when I've gone to Vegas but I've always had friends that didn't want to wait a long time to get there food.  This last time I went I almost gave up hope again when my man suggested we just get something from the to go line and head back to our hotel.. . So I didn't get to eat inside like I wanted, and I so desperately wanted to try one of their deserts.  But as least I finally got to try there food.  I plan on going back to Vegas and next time I'll make sure to put in reservations because I am determined to have a sit down meal here but I can't stand the thought of waiting 45 mins to an hour and half to just be seated.. . The food, although it was cold by the time we made it back to our hotel.  It was still beyond delicious and enjoyable.  It was so good I probably would have found a way to have seconds if we had stayed for a table which is probably I good thing we ended up getting it to go.. . I'm so excited and I can't wait to go back and eat there again!
I have always wanted to try this place since it is in prime location; smack dab in the middle of the Vegas strip. I got the chance to try Serendipity because my boyfriend was craving a sweet snack after some drinks. The place was still packed at 1130pm when we got there, so obviously, the quality of food has to be up there. We finally decided on a fried oreo sunday to share. Wow! Never have I had such a yummy but so bad for you treat! The whole thing was like an explosion of sinful goodness in my mouth. After trying the dessert, I can only imagine how great the rest of the items are.
20 minute wait to sit inside so we sat outside. . . Ordered the classic frrrrrozen hot chocolate for two and a side of fries while we read the front of the giant menu. . Waitress came out dragging her feet like this was the last place shed like to be. Brought over the fries and announced the hot chocolate would be right out. . Fries were stale and rough. Warm, if anything. . The hot chocolate covered by a pile of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Cold chocolate milk at best. . . Overall service was subpar. Food was mediocre. For the price, it could do much better.
Pink & orange decor? I'm there! I've been wanting to try a frozen hot chocolate since 2010. I went back to Vegas a year later and still didn't get one! So about a month ago I made a reservation for Easter weekend and finally satisfied my craving/curiosity. I decided to get the smaller size of mint chocolate in a to go cup and could not finish it by myself! Delicious but definitely sweet. It tasted just like I thought it would but was a bit runnier than I expected; it's easier to sip it through the straws rather than use a spoon while walking. My friends' green tea one didn't resemble green tea at all, it was just over sugared. . . I arrived fifteen minutes early for my six person reservation at 5pm. I ended up changing it for three and we were seated under the burning sun, so we asked our waiter, Jason, if we could move to the one under some umbrellas. He quickly cleaned up the table and we ended up ordering an Asian chicken salad, ahi tuna salad, and chicken lettuce wraps. Notice it's all forms of greenery because we hit the buffet for brunch ... The Asian chicken salad dressing was yummy and not sour/spicy, had plenty of warm white meat chicken, and the chopsticks were a nice touch. The ahi tuna I snuck from my friends' plate was chilled on the inside and warm/chewy on the outside. I poured some of my Asian dressing on a chicken lettuce cup and don't regret it one bit. Their lettuce cups are fresh and such a healthy green color; the filling stayed on the inside because of the multiple cup layers holding it in. . . Food is good, l'll try the macaroni and cheese pizza next time. . . *Remember to show your gold Total Rewards card before paying to get one dollar off each entree you order.
Amazing mac n cheese, chimichurri steak, fries,  etc etc etc.  The food is AMAZING.  Patio seating is also awesome, with such a great view of the strip and fun people watching.  Patio heaters made it enjoyable for an otherwise cooler than normal evening in Vegas.. . The walk up window for frozen hot chocolate, however, was disappointing.  I expected something like what is served in the restaurant, but the to-go version is pretty basic.  For the price, try it when you can take the time to get the proper version.
Great ice cream! I won't come back though because of the rude hostesses. We came to celebrate my son's birthdayand got served a double scoop of attitude and poor service.
I've only had the frozen hot chocolate but hey..........hey......HEY!  It was beyond remarkable.  I thought about sharing it but decided to pig out with my very own.  Only drawback here was long lines and it took a long time to fill the orders.
My fella was on a quest to find me the best carrot cake in Las Vegas for my birthday, so we headed to Serendipity 3 on a Sunday afternoon. We decided to start with a frozen hot chocolate, then have a late lunch and take the carrot cake to go. The frozen hot chocolate was more for him than me, and as I suspected, I wasn't a fan. . . He chose the cookies and cream flavor. It was big and covered in whipped cream, but too syrupy sweet and water-y for me, but he enjoyed it, though he probably wouldn't order it again. Worth experiencing once, though! . . The star of the show for me was the mac and cheese, which was decadent and perfectly seasoned. He went with a turkey club sandwich which was surprisingly tasty and gigantic (the portion sizes make the pricing pretty reasonable for the strip, in my opinion) and so between the two of us we had a really satisfying meal. I had to resist nabbing most of his fries. . . Then, the waitress brought us our to go cake and I nearly fell out of my chair. It was a HUGE slab of cake, with lots of thin layers and plenty of cream cheese frosting. I was still chipping away at it three days later and I'm a big eater. In the end, I didn't even finish the whole thing. If I was to do it again, I'd go with the sundae version, mixing cake and vanilla ice cream and eat it there. . . My only real disappointment was in the decor, I expected it to be cuter inside, but it appeared they were doing a remodel and also, I'm pretty snobby about that sort of thing. I also wasn't too keen on the scratched, cloudy looking plastic water glasses, but again, I'm pretty picky about details.. All in all, it was a fun afternoon outing and I enjoyed it.
Their frozen hot chocolate is to die for!!
This place is awesome! Great outdoor atmosphere and great food. My wife and I went there for a late breakfast. I had the breakfast burger, which was amazing! Next time I'm in vegas, I'll definitely get it again. My wife ordered the lucky 7, which was a ton of food for one person. Of course we ended the meal with the frrrrozen hot chocolate! . . I would highly recommend this place.
Beware not worth the wait! Service is horrible on the multiple occasions I've been here. The food is disgusting and comes cold. The only good thing is the frozen hot chocolate! Take it Togo ! Staff was rude, took forever, and made rude remarks to us even though we were polite. Manager gave us free food to apologize which was nice...she needs to reorganize staff and fire a few members of her team
I have been here numerous times for breakfast and every meal was DELICIOUS (Saints and Sinners is my favorite).   ! I have also been here for their dinner menu twice (and tried my friends' food) all four items were unfavorable. I would recommend Jimmy Johns or In and Out before ever eating their dinner menu again.
The manager is a complete jerk!!! We had a late lunch here on Saturday, it wasn't even busy, which was a pleasant surprise. We asked to sit by the street on the patio and the waiter was going to sit us there, but the manager said "no that's for a bigger party" which I didn't understand because they sat us at a table with the same amount of seating as the one by the street. He was a jerk! The waiter was nice and tried to be over nice to make up for his rude boss. The food was good, the wait was only 20 minutes, overall it was an ok experience.
New York's famous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is now in Las Vegas, with a walk-up window even! That means you can get it without the hour-long wait for a table and the $$ minimum per person - woot! Granted, it's served in a plastic Caesars Palace cup instead of a fancy sundae glass and it's about half the size but whatever - it's still just as delicious and totally worth the $11.
unfortunately, the patio is closed due to  construction. apparently it is a great place to people watch while drinking. i will be back. . i went for a sunday brunch. either make reservations or be a diamond member with TR. be prepared for a wait. . the Bloody Mary was uh-mazing! i still crave it. . i had the Central Park omelet & it was huge. all of their portions seemed to be generous. . overall, i was impressed. . two thumbs up.
This place gets 2 stars because of its location. Otherwise it'd be less than 1 star. We went in to grab some ice cream shake, a medium sized cup cost $12. Ok, I can live that. But a milk shake from baskin Robbins tastes much better than this crap. I understand it may be a brand thing but c'mon. Justify the price somehow. Won't be coming here again.
The frozen hot chocolate here tastes just like it does in NYC.  A bit steep, but it's Vegas.  They have a walk up window that's very convenient and the line moves pretty quickly. Would def recommend trying.
We were in the mood for a banana split so the first place that came to my mind was Serendipity. Came here with my mom, daughter and niece.. . So upon our arrival there was a 15 minute wait and the hostess takes down your name and sends a text once you table is ready. Told the hostess I will need a highchair too. 15 minutes later I get my text and we are seated. We walk into the dining room area and see plenty of free tables and the highchair I requested was not ready. So why the wait and why not have the table fully ready with the highchair if I waited 15 minutes?? . . Anyways, our waiter was very nice and attentive, unfortunately I don't know his name since he never told us. So we ordered the Don't Be Afraid of My Alfredo, The Tasty T-BLT and the Crab Cake Sandwich. ALL very delicious. The crab cake sandwich is a must try and the Tasty T-BLT is huge, can definitely share with another person. Had to save room for our dessert and so of course, we ordered what brought us here in the first place, the Outrageous Banana Split. Delicious yes but not your typical banana split. Theirs comes in a big sundae cup/bowl with 2 bananas sticking out and sadly no nuts but definitely a treat.. . This restaurant is cheerful, definitely kid-friendly and will offer you a one-of-a-kind dining experience.
Our server was amazing, what an amazing memory she has! Very knowledgable and truly enjoys interacting with her guests. I ordered the steak sandwich with eggs over hard. It was good. Just a heads up their portions are huge. I could barely eat a third of the sandwich will definitely split it next time. As for the dessert YUM! I've had the frozen hot chocolate last time and the Oreo sundae this time, big enough to split 8 ways or more and soooo delicious.  One day I'll win some money and buy the $1,000.00 sundae haha
