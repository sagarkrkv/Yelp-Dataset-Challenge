Not a bad meal, but recommendations from friends had me thinking this would be more of an event.. . My wife had the mussels and fries, liked the mussels, hated the thin flat fries. I had the pate and the egg salad + salmon sandwich. Pate was pretty good, sandwich was disappointing. It also came with chip-like waffle fries that I didn't like.. . Also shared a St. Germain drink w/white wine and club soda that was tasty, it appeared to be a standard St. Germain recipe.
I came with high expectatio expectations after hearing friends rave about the place.. . The complimentary apple chutney and crisp baguette was a lovely starter.. . I got the onion au gratin while my partner got the half roast chicken. The chicken was mouthwateringly moist with a crispy skin. The mashed potato side was creamy and delicious and the accompanying bacon, onion, and mushroom mix was perfectly done as well.. . But my onion soup was a huge disappointment. The flavor had a bitter aftertaste and the gyuere cheese on top was already sunken into the soup, leaving it a gloppy mess instead of a crisp crust. Definitely not worth $10.. . Overall, it was a good experience with a wonderful view as well, but skip the onion soup!
I loved this place! My husband and I went here on a Saturday night with no reservations and figured we'd have to wait at least an hour as walk-in's... but the host told us we could score an outdoor patio table in 45 minutes. Nice! We took the buzzer and went to play some table games. Our table was actually ready only 25 minutes later. Very nice!. . We were seated outside on the patio, which had a great view of the Bellagio across the street and the great water shows. Our service was friendly, attentive, and helpful. Our waiter made great recommendations and our waters were refiled regularly. The food was great, and the prices were incredibly reasonable for the quality of the food, and for being on the Strip. I'd highly recommend this as a nice dinner place, and I look forward to dining here again the next time I'm in town!
Excellent restaurant.. No need for me to add any comments to what's already here
Reasons why this place is amazing! . 1. Delicious coffee! . 2. Fresh bread, butter, and jam if you order a meal that comes with it. 3. Great prompt service . 4. Fresh squeezed oj and apple juice !!! The apple juice is the best I have ever had.. 5. Eggs are could perfectly . 6. Recommendable dishes: omelette and the corned beef hash. 7. Great sizes for the prices. 8. Lovely outdoor dining area . Basically I am in love with this place and can't wait to return on my next trip!
This place is the best place on earth.
I love this resturant specially their location and steak burger.
Kim made reservations at this place that is located on the front patio of the Las Vegas Strip at the Paris hotel. If you read back to one of my original posts you will see that we ate at a bad sushi place in Vegas... this is the exact same location, just a new restaurant. Let me tell you that the service didn't get much better.  The food was good, but not worth writing home to mom about. The view is awesome.  It is located across the street from the Bellagio fountains (which never seem to be running when I am in Vegas) and you can watch all of the Vegas weirdos walking down the strip.
I've been here 3 times now in the last 12 months. Each time Mon Ami Gabi chefs outdid themselves. I've had the oysters, steak, mussels, and the Thursday Lamb Shank special.. everything was delicious! . They have a great selection of wines as well as port wines. . The service is always spectacular. If you can, request Keith for your waiter, he is a blast! Every time I am in Vegas, this is a must for a night out for me.
This is a place that not only serves good food, but also offers one of the best places to watch Vegas. Although they do not take reservations for the patio, we were able to be seated immediately outside with our reservation, even though they were quoting a 60-90 minute wait. The food is always consistent and delicious. You will definitely want to try a variety of appetizers, the onion soup, and the filet.
Ordered 3 dishes: blueberry waffle, chicken, Brie and Apple crepe and eggs florentine Benedict. . The crepe was great. The waffle was cold and I had to have it sent back. The muffin and the hash brown in the eggs Benedict dish were burnt and crispy. . . Service is good. Don't think I'll come back though as Vegas has a lot more to offer.
My friends and I stopped by for a late lunch.  We only had a few hours before dinner so we weren't super hungry.  I ordered the baked brie (served with roasted garlic and toasted bread), one of my friends ordered the arugula salad with walnuts, grapefruit and goat cheese, and my other friend ordered the smoked salmon (served with bread, capers and creme fraiche).  We ordered a small carafe of a St. Germaine cocktail (it was $12.50 for the carafe and we got about 5 short drinks out of it).  Before our food came out they brought us warm bread with delicious butter, and this grated carrot salad marinated in honey along with other things.  It was delicious! Our food came out shortly after and we loved all three of our dishes.  I forget our servers name but he was super nice and prompt.  I would love to goback to try their entrees.  Our dishes were a little bit pricey but definitely not too bad for being on the strip.
Love the salmon entree great steaks too ! Its a nice place to bring out of state guest to watch the water show...
Patio is awesome but can get crowded.
The line for patio seating was hella long.  We walked right in and were seated in the bright sunny solarium.  Score 1 for me.  Awesome servers here kept our coffee and waters full, brought me my yummy mimosa, and got our orders quickly. . . Immediate upon sitting they bring you your own crisp baguette with butter.  Absolutely delish.  We both ordered eggs Benedict.  I was impressed with the very crisp English muffin, and while my eggs were ok, my husband complained about the lack of egg whites on his, where they separated from the yolk during poaching.  For the money, I would come back here.
Wow so decadent.  The service was attentive and polite.  We ordered an olive plate as well as some goat cheese appetizer and by the time our food came, which included a soup, I'm sad to say I was hardly able to eat it!  Very very good, but choose wisely and don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach!. . Generous portions and everything is very rich.  Great wine selection, too.
I've eaten here twice and both times were good. Not fantastic though, which makes me think I need to return for the steak frites! The patio is definitely one of the best on the strip. It has some shaded areas but can still get extremely hot.. my butter melted completely just from sitting in the sun! Great people watching.. it's too bad you can't request to be seated there when you make a reservation. I think my favorite item that I've tried is the chicken crepe. The bread and butter is very good.. the little bag makes it feel like a true french baguette!
I did my wedding dinner here. All the food and appetizers were phenomenal! The goat cheese sticks and ahi sliders were the bomb.com! I got tons of compliments on the food. The service was also exceptional! Kristina and her crew took care of a party of 60 without a problem! She also let us know when we were at our minimum so we didn't have to overspend and made a vegetarian dish that wasn't on our set menu for a vegan friend! . . Drew, the coordinator, made the booking process smooth and seamless, which was essential since we were coming in from out of town! . . Loved this place!!! :)
My absolute favorite non-buffet breakfast option on the Strip. This is also my favorite of threeMon Ami Gabi locations we've visited, and it's pretty much the Vegas factor that wins out.. . You are going to pay more to eat breakfast here than at a buffet - this is true. But this food is memorable. I highly recommend anything Bananas Foster. Doesn't matter if you get the waffles or pancakes, but, I guaranty these are the lightest, crispiest, tastiest waffles you'll ever eat if you so choose. . . Also, and this is the most important part - the coffee here is beyond reproach. It is so good, I had the server write down the Web site for me so I could order a couple bags. I'm typically not a French roast guy, but this coffee is all kinds of special.. . Of note - outside dining is walk-up only. Get there early and spend a little time waiting in the casino if you want the beautiful terrace seating. If you want a reservation, you can call, but that's going to get you inside tables only.
The only thing better than hearing "We have a full bar" when you go out at night is hearing "We have a full ESPRESSO bar" the next morning. . . I sipped on a cup of foamy cappuccino on the patio of Mon Ami Gabi at Paris looking idly over at the Italian Lake Bellagio. The world suddenly felt smaller. Only in Vegas. . . A short complimentary baguette started up our appetite, followed by our order of Fall Mushroom Soup, poured at the table into a bowl of creme fraiche, chives, and dried mushrooms. It prepared our palate perfectly for the rest of the meal.. . The next dish, Housemade Country Pate, fell a bit short, needing flavor and a softer texture if one hopes to spread it onto the accompanying toast. It came topped with whole grain mustard and flanked by pickled mini cucumbers, pearl onions, and olives. . . The Duck Leg Confit compensated by being perfectly cooked, tenderly shredding under the fork. The flavors met all expectations I had for this classic French favorite. It was accompanied by a bed of lentils.. . Vegas is a paradoxical portal into a world of vulgarity and refinement, and at Mon Ami Gabi, I started the day with the latter, although I can't promise my escapades didn't end with the former.
Made reservation on yelp an hour before I get there, got seated immediately when I get there. I was really happy they led us to the table right by the window which had a GREAT view of the strip when I did not even ask for. Ordered the seafood platter and steak. Both good. Nothing to complain.
My wife qnd I had the best dinner in Vegas for a reasonae price. Would return on a heartbeat.
After having had the most delicious croissant at Baguette Cafe, the breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi was still great but not extraordinary. I really enjoyed the hashbrown which has just right amount of salty in it. Loved the grapefruit juice!
I've dined here before and really appreciate the ambiance.  The outdoor patio is a great place to people watch. The interior screams french bistro. Well, I haven't been to a restaurant in France, so it's just what I would interpret as a french bistro. Overall, I averaged my experience to an A-OK review.. . Saturday brunch review:. Was in town for my friend's bachelorette party and had reservations for 22 people. Yup, you heard me.. 22. Our server kicked butt and was oh so nice. I felt like the wait staff did everything to make us happy. The food was another story. I can't blame one particular person because making food for a large party is tough, but I left a bit disappointed with how much I paid.. . Steak and eggs: I ordered MR and it came out well done. Thank goodness it wasn't dry and hard. The seasoning made up for it :) The eggs were perfectly scrambled. All in all, the food was only okay flavor wise but it was cold. I think everyone had cold food because again, feeding a large party at once is tough!. . Frites: Substituted the hash browns for fries because I've had them before and it was good. This time around, they were crispy, yummy, but cold.. . Bloody Mary Bar: If you like em, they have a little bar where you can garnish it with whatever your heart desires.
Mon Ami Gabi was repeatedly mentioned and recommended on my last trip to Vegas, so thought we would try it out. It's more of an Americanized French restaurant, but it's located inside Paris, and opens until very late at night, perfect for a Vegas stay!. . We went for a very late dinner (because of a very late lunch) before we headed straight to the clubs. Many of us were preparing for an open bar night so we ordered accordingly! . . I tried the bacon salad and the baked scallop appetizer (not to be confused with the seared scallop entree). The salad was huge and would have been sufficient for lunch. The baked scallops only came with three, but with all the cheese, cream and caramelized onions on it, it was plenty. If you arehungry, I recommend going for the chicken grand mere or one of the steaks. They are huge!. . I also over indulged on the baguette for the table. Came with butter and some pickled veggies. Overall, great value for money and decent food in Vegas!
One of our favorite restaurants in all of LV!  Escargot done right, salads, bread, steaks, seafood and perfect service.  Can we bring it home?  Keep doing what you are doing!  Fabulous!
This French restaurant was very cute and had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain. I'd definitely come again and would recommend. . . Decor:. Very cute and I loved that they had an outdoor patio area as well as a covered terrace. I would have preferred to sit in the covered terrace but it was such a nice day that we all opted for the outdoor patio. . . Food:. The food was delicious! I absolutely savored my (huge) brie cheese and roasted butternut squash quiche. My friend's seared scallops looked amazing and would have been my entree choice if I wasn't vegetarian!  The freshly baked baguettes were also very good--crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.. . Service:. Pretty good, though they were not completely slammed during the time we went. My only complaint was that they did not allow our group of 5 to sit at a table for 8, but did allow a couple to sit at a table for 6... We ended up moving to a very small table for 4, but it all worked out. . . Overall:. Great place to dine. We didn't get dessert but instead, walked over to Sugar Bakery for some ice cream instead. I'd definitely come again and would plan to try a dessertnext time.
Dining inside, we found the ambience to be nice, although the restaurant was crowded and bustling. Service was prompt, efficient and professional.  I choose the  Steak Frites, with the New York  strip cut.  The steak was average size and average quality. The potatoes  were like a cross between chips and fries - not in a good way.  My wife ordered the Steak Bernaise, which she enjoyed very much.   Overall, attractive "French" bistro  atmosphere, good service  and decent food .  Not a bad choice.
Had reservations for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Wanted to sit outside but it was an hr wait. We ordered a sangria and a bloody mary. They have a bloody mary bar so you will actually make it yourself. Its unlimited. For the food we ordered the salmon spinach salad, seafood crepe and the french toast topped w blueberries. The salmon was moist and the spinach had a light dressing. It couldve had more flavor but overall it was a nice light meal. My friend had the seafood crepe which had a cheesey creamy filling. It wasnt too heavy. The shrimp was really good. It was separate from the crepe. A good grilled season to it. I believe it was 5 pcs. The french toast came w blueberries and a blueberry syrup. I thought it has a nice crisp outside but was still soft in the inside. It was pretty sweet for me but my friend had no problem fisnishing it. This place is always a good choice.
Admittedly, have only eaten here for breakfast/brunch.  But we've had that meal here many, many times (this is one of the "mandatory" stops every time we're in LV).   Staff has always been excellent, the place is very cute (we always try and eat on the patio) and the food delicious.   I *looooove* the skinny pancakes (cinnamon of course) and the Quiche Lorraine.
Large portions, quick service.  Food was tasty although not fantastic.  Good selection of wine.
Excellent customer service & the patio area is what makes this spot a great restaurant experience. . . Otherwise what I ate was average tasting & average presentation also. I had the egg white & turkey omelette.
Cant beat the view from the patio, BUT get in the shade...MAN OH MAN CAN IT GET HOT!!! i gave you your warning....MAKE SURE TO STAY IN THE SHADE it can be miserable if your not. . . also if you want to get on the patio, a reservation wont help, you have to go there and let them know and youl be on a waiting list which took us about 30 minutes and they will seat you there. . the food is pricey be aware, paying for a good view and better than ave food. . the shrimp was only like 4 or 5 pieces for 17 buvks??? It was good but not worth the price. . The entre was good. But just come here and enjoy a mimosa and enjoy the view in the shade
Love the atmosphere.  Its best to get their late in the afternoon when the Bellagio fountains go off and stay to watch the sun go down as the lights of The Strip come on.
super good first time trying SNIAL!! SOOOO GOOD ! flavors were AMAZING !
I came here for a late lunch, and despite very slow service, enjoyed the meal. The outdoor patio was warm and sunny - a rarity for a casino/hotel restaurant here to have a nice patio. The half baguette brought to the table was hot and fresh. The food was very tasty and reasonably portioned. I shared the sandwich of the day with my husband since we weren't too hungry. It was served open-faced (easier to share) with toasted whole-grain bread, thinly spread goat cheese, with a few rounds of roasted eggplant, greens and yellow grape tomatoes all dressed in a vinaigrette. The beer was expensive, as was the food, but that seems to be nearly inescapable here. The menu seemed to have a lot of heavier dishes; surprised not to see a basic salad nicoise on the menu. I hate how expensive simple good food is here in Las Vegas, but this isn't a place where I felt like I wasted my money.
You will really feel like you're in Paris here!  The interior of the restaurant is one of my favorites in Vegas.  The glass room is beautiful if you can get a seat outside.  Every meal I've had here has been delicious, and the prices are very reasonable.  The "steak classique" was actually not my favorite, a little tough, but flavor was good.  I have heard the breakfast there is great, but haven't had a chance to get there for it yet.  Overall, a great choice in Vegas.
My favorite place in Vegas. Had another wonderful terrace breakfast. Wait for the terrace was 15 minutes. They move the line quickly. Classic eggs benedict were cooked to perfection. Pleased to see a gluten free option. Service was excellent. This restaurant moves with a bustling fluidity of a true french culinary experience. Champagne cocktails were also great.
My wife and I were in Las Vegas in April 2014 for a wedding, and had relatively few meals on our own. I'm very glad that a friend had recommended Mon Ami Gabi. Having recently been to France and enjoyed bistro food there, we were pleased to be able to get it much closer to home. From the crisp, delicious baguette and butter provided to start our meal, to the onion soup, pate, roasted brie with honey and hazelnuts, and my open-face salmon / egg salad sandwich, everything was delicious. The frites, probably cut on a mandoline, were really crisp, a perfect fry. Although my friend had recommended that we sit outside (facing the Bellagio fountain), the wait for an outside table was ~45-60 minutes, and we elected to eat inside, which was fine and much quieter than many area restaurants. I would certainly return to Mon Ami Gabi.
We had a great anniversary lunch thanks to this wonderful restaurant and Daniel our server was professionally courteous.
This place was great,. try it all!!
The food and experience was much better than I anticipated for a place with a fake Eiffel tower out front.  I've been to Paris several times, and this place actually had some charm and flavors reminiscent of my favorite place on Earth. The decor was lovely with art nouveau touches and bistro style furnishings. They give you fresh baguettes in paper bags like they do in pastisseries...cute. The service was excellent, the garcons dressed for the part. My husband had the bone in rib eye which he pronounced extremely delicious. We also had escargot and it was as good as any I had in France. It's a nice plus that the dining room is across the street from the Bellagio water fountain and show, which you can get a nice view of if seated near the windows.
You must order steak frites when you come here. Ignore the rest of the menu and focus in on the steak. It's their specialty for a reason. Both versions of the Filet Mignon and the New York Strip Steak with bordelaise sauce were incredible. The Filet Mignon Au Poivre had more of a kick to it, but was cooked to perfection and delicious like the rest of the steaks we tried. Our knives slid through our juicy cuts of meat like butter and each bite was rich with flavor and spice. I also ordered a glass of the Pinot Noir, which was light and fruity. For dessert we tried the creme brulee, which was decadently rich and caramelized..  . Reservations at Mon Ami Gabi are a necessity. I reserved through my Yelp App via OpenTable, which was easy and convenient. The patio is prime for people watching; the interior recalls a Parisian bistro. The service was excellent and our food came quickly.
I always pass by this restaurant when I am at the Paris Hotel and Casino and it is always super busy. So, we finally made a reservation and had dinner here one night. . . Hangar steak with pommes frites - AWESOME! . That's the only thing that I ordered.. . The service was very good.. The price was ok around $20-$30 per entree.. I'm still thinking about the fries.. . Great place to pregame before you hit the club's and casino.
This was my first time dining here in about 4 years and my hopes were way up. I remember the fish and chips being one of the best things I've had. Since I was back in Vegas with my boyfriend I raved about how much we had to go. Well when I visited last night I was extremely disappointed. The fish was very bland and the chips seemed a little hard and old. I'm not sure what changed over the years but it was not a changefor the better. We were seated quickly because we ate inside and the caesar salad and baguette were very good. Thus the 2 stars and not 1. Our bill was $65 for dinner and so not worth it. There are so many better restaurants to spend that kind of money on. I will not be visiting or recommending again.
Came here for breakfast based on a recommendation. Amazing!!! I will definitely come back to try the steak at some point, but breakfast is totally, 100% my favorite meal. The corned beef hash is delicious, fresh, made in house, and light. And then - the skinny lemon pancakes. I love lemon flavor, and this was so fresh!! Super thin pancake almost to the point of being a crepe. Fresh marmalade, cream on the side, and a lemon half to juice. The faint bits of added sugar or crystallized lemon gave a glorious crunch to the overall soft texture. Top it all off, It's shaped like a tree star from land before time (good ol childhood memories)!! Love it!!!!
What can I contribute that roughly 3,700 Yelpers haven't already communicated about this place... My wife and I came here for breakfast and I was disappointed by the service. I ordered a caramel latte and it had no caramel. I told the waitress and she said she would check. When she back she told me they were out of caramel and offered another beverage, which I replaced with tea. For breakfast I ordered the eggs Benedict special which replaced the Canadian bacon with mushrooms. this was pure perfection... I laid my knife into the egg to watch the yellow gloriousness ooze out and it was perfect. The second offering was over cooked and I was highly disappointed. I told the waitress and she fixed it immediately. The third issue we had was with the coffee service. Twice I had to get up and track down someone to refill my wife's coffee. This place is located perfectly on the strip and has a warm, cozy, and inviting atmosphere. The outside patio is perfect for enjoying your meal. Please note for dinner make a reservation don't try to walk in. I will return to this place in the future.
Don't go here for breakfast. Both mine and my husband's food was very greasy, cool, and not very tasty. I usually find it difficult to screw up breakfast, but this place found a way. The service was also slow. The $40 spent on some coffee and a few eggs was the worst $40 I spent in Vegas. I will not be back!!
I have never written a bad review for a breakfast place.... EVER!  But I felt compelled after my, I guess we will call it "breakfast." . . First off, it should be called "break-slow" because service and wait was far too long. Granted, the place was kinda busy but there were many open tables and we were seated immediately. I ordered coffee and waited a long time for "cream." It was really milk in a cup which is ridiculous. A French restaurant uses milk for creamer? I didn't believe it until I drank it straight from the cup... My guess is 1% or skim... Better with Cheerios than coffee. Anyone who takes cream with coffee knows that is a straight up SIN. . . Next, I should've been forewarned of the food quality when the people next to us sent their food back and complained It was the second day in a row doing so. Much like their complaints, my food was cold and overall inedible. The bacon and hash browns were ok, not too bad but the eggs were completely runny and the toast was hard as a brick. I used the rock frozen butter they gave me and grated it through the bread! Haha, too funny. I stabbed the butter with my knife and it would not go through. Some things you just need to be there to see. . . So all in all paid way too much for food I could not stomach. Waitress knew I was unhappy but was uncaring. Too bad, I had high hopes... Never again for me, nor will any of my friends once I fill em in...
A pleasant dining  experience. My wife took the chicken mouse pate and the scallops whereas I had a Hanger steak with pomme frites. The steak was ok but a bit tough but my wife enjoyed her meal. There is a nice atmosphere for people watching and a view of the Bellagio fountains.
The worst dinner. I ordered the skate fish which was ammonia ridden to the point of making me nauseous. The waiter didn't seem surprised when brought to his attention. The manager came over but was not in any way apologetic. Absolutely no concern was shown as she couldn't be bothered by such serious food and health issues. I am thinking should at least bring this to the attention of health department.
Made reservations for brunch on a Thursday morning. Just fyi, reservationsare only for indoor seating. You have to get there early for the outdoor seating that everyone is talking about otherwise it's a long wait. . . I got the croissant sandwich, which was nothing to rave about. However, the boyfriend got the corned beef hash which is recommended on yelp, and that was delicious! So, lesson learned. Make sure you order the corned beef hash if you are here for breakfast/brunch!. . We thought about ordering the steak frites but felt it was a bit too early for steak. However, whenever I'm back in Vegas again I definitely want to try it out!
We come here a lot for brunch. French toast is amazing! Always good service, nice atmosphere.
Both of us ordered three courses and were very satisfied with the first two courses. The food arrived fast and came out hot. The desserts were the only disappointing part of the evening. They tasted reheated and not made to order. Overall, a solid place that doesn't break the bank.. . The restaurant is busy and definitely feels like a large restaurant.  The staff does their best to give you individualized attention but the fact is, they want to turn the tables fast.  Don't go excepting a relaxing evening...but then again, a relaxing evening is probably impossible in Vegas.
Every month, our team at work plans a team building event for us to get to know one another outside of the office. For the month of March, we wanted to do it big.  We wanted to experience something out of the norm, somewhere that required a dress up opportunity. There were a few options, however, we all ended up deciding on Mon Ami Gabi for our "Fancy Dinner" event. Boy were we excited!. . When you enter the restaurant, you immediately hit the bar area. Along with the hostess stand, you see a bunch of high top tables and bar seating. The place just exudes a romantic vibe! It's located directly under the Vegas version Eiffel Tower and along the strip sidewalk. The lights in the location are dim and intimate, the white table clothes bring the upscale element. Wine glasses on the table sparkled brightly. Man, we were excited! Our table top was on the south end of the restaurant and the corner windows viewed the sidewalk veranda and the tower base. Our server, although I can't remember her name, was super sweet! She was personable and offered some really great appetizers and drinks. What I really liked about her was her efficiency! We had a 13 person party and she was still on it! Our food came out hot and ready in record time! For our apps, drinks and meals, here's what we had:. . Chateau Laronde Desormes Bordeaux for $54 a bottle - This wine was on point! It was soft with a sweet finish. Definitely an everyday kind of Bordeaux, something you can drink all the time. This wine went great with my meal!. . Warm Brie Cheese for $12.95 - Served with black pepper honey, garlic, hazelnuts, croutons and greens. I love brie. This combination was no different. Whole cloves of roasted garlic enhanced the flavor of the cheese very well. . . Chicken Liver Mousse Pate for $11.95 - First time trying this.  THE BEST THING I HAD THAT NIGHT! Served with burgundy red wine mustard and toast brioche with a garnish of gherkins and olives. The burgundy mustard brought a spicy/tangy element and the mouse was so rich and divine. This is MUST TRY, so delicious!. . Baked Goat Cheese for $11.95 - Another great dish. Tomato sauce surrounded the cheese with herb garlic bread. The cheese was super creamy and went well with the tomato profile. . . Seafood Platter for $49.95 - What a platter! Stuffed with shrimp, oysters and lobsters, this dish offered a little bit of everything for everyone! There were various dipping sauces and it was all served over ice. . . Bone in Ribeye for $39.95 - This was my actual dinner. 22oz cut of steak, PERFECTLY cooked to my temperature, served with a bearnaise sauce and their signature hand cut fries. The steak was delicious. The right amount of marbleized meat, perfectly seasoned and packed with flavor and juices. AH-MAZE-ING. The bearnaise sauce was definitely not needed but offered another element. The fries were flat and super crispy. Really helped to break up the meat with a crunchy aspect. . . What a meal! This place has got to be one of the best upscale restaurants I've tried here in Vegas. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an amazing date night restaurant, team building dinner joint or event a place that serves THE BEST pate! I will for sure be back, time and time again.  Thank you so much, Mon Ami Gabi, for making this evening one that I'll never forget!
Filet mignon was delectable. Wine list was impressive, and our wine choices were delicious. We loved Mon Ami Gabi!
Great place to eat on the strip. We had a large party and our server was more than accommodating. The ambiance was quaint and relaxing, a contrast to many other places on the strip which tend to be loud. I ordered a butternut squash salad  which was excellent.
Wow, looks gimicky from the outside, but a foodie's paradise on the inside.  The steak and fries best ever had.  Everything was of hardy portions despite it's French influence.  Not too foo foo for your big Amercican apetite, this menu has enough variety to please many people.  Will probably my go to place when I'm hungry, want good food, breath-taking views and reasonable prices!
Ate here for our first anniversary. Wanted a place w a patio. They gave us a pager and told us that it would be about 45 mins. So we went and played some slot machines. . . 15 mins later the pager went off and we were seated on the amazing patio overlooking the strip and Bellagio fountains. We had 3 glasses of wine, a scallop appetizer (amazing!!!), I had filet mignon in a red wine sauce, and my wife had scallops. Absolutely delicious. . . We said that it was a top 3 meal of all time for us. The total tab was 150 after tip, and we thought that was a great price for all the stuff we ordered. I highly recommend this for dinner while the sun goes down.  Very kind and quick service.
It's super easy to make a reservation at this place using Open Table through the Yelp mobile app! (Note that reservations are for indoor seating only, since outdoor seating is still first-come, first-served.) We came in at around 11:30, so there was really no need for reservation, but they still definitely get bonus points.. . They start you off with a warm baguette and butter, and it's positively delightful. Definitely gave it that Parisian restaurant feel (although in Paris, they don't give you your table bread wrapped in a paper bag stamped with the restaurant logo). The bread had the signature crisp French bread exterior coupled with the pillowy, light interior.. . They also gave us a small shredded carrot salad appetizer, compliments of the chef. It was nice, but not really anything worth writing home about. It had a nice acidic kick to it, but was still a bit too liquid-y for my liking.. . We ordered the escargot appetizer, which came heavily sauced in basil butter. The snails were tender (note that they do not serve these in-shell -- most snails don't really come in their shells, anyway -- they're usually re-placed in re-usable shells just for presentation). And the basil butter was so good for dipping, they needed to bring us another loaf of bread. . . I also got the French onion soup, which was warm, complex and comforting. Great stuff. My boyfriend also got the salmon, which was good, but not really a stand-out. I've had better salmon, that's been better seasoned and with a better exterior texture. . . For dessert, we also got the profiteroles, which were delightful. The vanilla ice cream, plus the drizzle of really good quality chocolate made it the perfect way to cap off the meal. Add a glass of pinot, and I was set for the night.. . All in all, this was a great place to grab a bite -- the prices were affordable (considering you're in Vegas), the service was on point, they're open pretty late and the food is delicious.
My friend wanted to try this place so we made a reservation. We got there a little before our reservation time but the they seated us right away. They have a nice outdoor sitting areabut it was too full so we sat somewhere else inside.. near the outdoor area. My friends got filet mignon and I just got a classic steak with red wine sauce. The sauce is amazing.. The steak was okay, nothing extraordinary. We got a bottle of champagne which was like forty dollars. They had a bar but the cocktail list wasn't on the menu for some reason. The waiter was super friendly.. Over friendly. Oh, and the bread was yummy too. Overall, it was pretty delish!
We sat outside on a beautiful Vegas night, it was a bit windy so we didn't get to watch the fountains at Bellagio. The server was very attentive. Our food arrived extremely fast. The filet mignon with Merlot butter was delicious.
We made breakfast reservations and were seated inside.  I'm unsure of what it would take to get a coveted patio seat.  I was very happy with our table, as it was away from the crowd and it was a windy day.  . . The menu is full of Parisian breakfast fare, and it was difficult to decide what to get.  Upon the recommendation from our waitress we ordered the banana, Nutella, and hazelnut crepes to share with the table.  They were phenomenal and perfectly done.  My standard eggs Benedict was savory and delicious.  The coffee was abundant and rich.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and not much was said once we got the food, which is a sign of a great meal.  I will definitely come back again.
Food was really good. But the service was really bad   We waited 20minutes at the table before anybody even said anything.  And the person that final said something was a witness that had just got back from lunch and nobody was covering her tables for her. Unfortunately for us we were setting at her table.
We went there after our friends wedding for wedding dinner. They sit us right away outside with amazing view of Bellagio Fountains. The food was great. Their steaks are the best!
Great location for people watching and the food is awesome.. Great variety when it comes to food and drinks. Worth a try.. Afordable as well.
This place is consistently good every time I visit Las Vegas. Make sure you try the French onion soup.The steaks taste great, especially for the price, and the service is great! Patio seating is first come first serve, but the view is worth the wait! Watching the Bellagio water show while eating dinner makes for a great dining experience. Definitely make time for this place!
I've only been here once and I thought it was okay, my husband absolutely loved it though, so it reallydepends on your taste. The restaurant can be a little pricey but the quality of the food is worth it. The fries are amazing! The restaurant it's self is a little busy, but very distinct in style. Its personally not my type of restaurant/food preference but I would recommend it.
I wanted this to be a romantic night overlooking the Bellagio fountains before going to "O" cirque du soleil. My night was foiled by one misstep after another which added up to be a 3 star rating.. . 1. We had to wait 20 minutes after arriving despite coming 5 min early to our reservation.. 2. We wanted to share a salad "endive and pear" which was delicious, but did not split or give a second plate until we asked.. 3. I ordered the trout which was overcooked and impossible to cut with the dull butter knives.. 4. It was overcrowded, extremely loud and not romantic at all.. . Needless to say we did not get seated outdoors because there was a 2.5 hour wait.. . The salad was tasty as was the mashed potatoes, but for $100 dollar check I should have received better service.
Over rated went there. For breakfast nothing special save a few dollars and go to the regular cafe in Paris for breakfast same type of food but cheaper
MON AMI GABI is really what most Vegas restaurants should be -- but are not.. . 1.  Indoors/Outdoors.  They have dark indoors, a big glass room semi-indoors, and an outside patio.. . 2.  In a great spot.  (Under the Eiffel Tower, across from the Bellagio Fountains.). . 3.  A broad menu.  (Despite being a 'French' restaurant, it's been Americanized enough for any visitor to find something tasty on the menu.). . 4.  Prices are strip reasonable.  Meaning you're not being r-ped, which more and more is a disturbing trend on the strip.  . . SIDEBAR. . I get it that some restaurants want to be exclusive and riff-raff free.  That a dashing man and his fabulous babe want to be dressed to the nines... nowhere near the overweight shorts and wifebeater clan clasping four foot tall plastic Eiffel Tower Diabetes Cocktails.   So if such places want to charge $60 a pound for fish (Hello MILOS) you're welcome to do so.. . However, too much of the strip is joining in this bank account draining pricing scheme.  Places that are inside dim strip hotels, with no view, inconvenient from the street, with limited menus.  If this trend doesn't stop soon... it'll be cheaper to gamble for your dinner at a roulette table.  Seriously --. . -- may I speak on behalf of all Yelpsters and say WE DON'T GIVE A CREPE IF TABLE GAMBLING IS DOWN IN VEGAS and that can't be used as an excuse to serve $25 hamburgers.   Vegas is supposed to be fun... not a grapefruit enema.. . END SIDEBAR. . Anyway -- MON AMI GABI still gets that.  The service -- although not really French -- is quite good and the restaurant is more than accommodating.  They did something for us on late afternoon that no restaurant has ever done for me.  I don't want to say it out loud or it might ruin it, but let's say it's akin to offering a Happy Hour hours before the actual Happy Hour starts.  NO ONE DOES STUFF LIKE THIS... but Mon Ami Gabi did.  With zero complaint.  They warned us our food might take a bit longer... but it wasn't any longer than any Vegas lunch.. . If you want a really romantic meal, this isn't the kind of place to do it unless you get a table on the street and you LOVE noise and crowds.  However, if you like a fun place that takes you out of Vegas while somehow being in the center of it -- give MON AMI GABI a try.
The restaurant is lovely.  The food good and our server Maggie was a delight. What almost made it a dreadful event was the rap music placed over the whole restaurant.  So annoying and not conducive to the french refined atmosphere.  This was last Friday.  I tried to get the attention of the hostess at the desk but she was busy and I had to get in the road.   It was not even french rap.
The steak tartare is fantastic!  I'd come back to Vegas just to dine here.  Great selection of imported beer and wine as well!
LOVE IT!  Possibly one of my favotite lunch places on the strip!  Great location, great food, great service, and great for people watching!  Overall, always a fabulous experience when I dine here!
Great breakfast. Good mimosas and bloody marys. The French toast and eggs Benedict with duck was delicious. The ambiance was good too. Sit on the pAtio.
I love this place and always come here every time I am in vegas. Mostly for breakfast because I love their quiche Lorraine. The crust is so flaky and good. . Service is always good.
It is a tradition of a couple of buddies and me to stop by here for a hungover Sunday breakfast.  I love the hamburger with egg and the french onion soup.  Its great to sit on the patio and watch the strip.  Good end to a trip.
Don't plan on being treated very well. The hostess staff could care less about you when you arrive. They are just there to have poor attitudes and here cattle. Save yourself the trip and go somewhere else.
I came for the lobster sandwich, and it was cool, The rib eye and french fries were probably among my favorites here.  I think you pay for the nice view and ambiance.  This place is always busy, you just have to be careful what you order and also their lunch and dinner menu are different so if you have something in mind you want to eat make sure it is on the menu for when you plan on going.
This is a great spot for Vegas breakfast, which occurs around Noon, maybe 1pm. Coffee and some booze, a reasonably priced steak, and some delicious baked cheese.. . Always a standard for our Vegas trips
