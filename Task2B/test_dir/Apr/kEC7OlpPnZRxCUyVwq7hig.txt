The most miserable experience in a hotel!  I wasted almost 2 hours waiting in a long line to check in and my luggage to arrive to my room. I was woken up by construction workers outside and a weird smell into room that maybe coming from the machinery the workers are using. I can't get the balcony doors to shut, so it maybe letting in the fumes. I called the hotel 20 minutes ago and they said security is going to be sent up to investigate. Thank goodness there isn't a fire.
The Hard Rock Casino used to be my favorite part of Las Vegas. Since it was re-modeled, it is definitely not the same. . . I stayed at the actual hotel for the first time this past weekend. The customer service is not only the worst I have received in Las Vegas, but in all of the hotels I have frequented in my life. . . Waiting in line at the front desk was a nightmare. The staff acted like they were doormen at a club, as if I hadn't paid money to stay there. One staff member told me check-in was from 3pm-4pm. When I went to pick up my room key at 4pm, another staff member told me check-in wasn't until 5pm. I was told, "I know it will make you feel better to know when you are going to get your room, but we just don't guarantee a check-in time. There's just no way of knowing." And then she laughed at me and made no eye contact. The hotel is aware they aren't even located on the strip, right? Does the staff know that they aren't the rock stars that are featured in the hotel? . . When I finally got to check-in, my room had empty beer bottles in the room from the person who had stayed there the night prior. Also, there were dirty towels in the sink. . . I will never stay/gamble there again. It's a crappy hotel with service you would expect to receive at the 99 cent store.
Seriously, never again! We booked a room with a King Size bed and received a double Queen size bed... Don't try to tell them you don't want it because you reserved a King Size, they will treat you like an idiot and even start yelling at you! Not only the employee but the manager as well (so don't call him, it's useless). They will argue that it's not because you have reserved "that type of room" that you'll get it... Doh, what's the point of a reservation then? Just setup a website saying "I want a room, deal with it!". . . The bedrooms (at the "Paradise"), are dark, very dark! There is also only a shower (no bathtub?).  . . They also messed up at the checkout, charging the wrong credit card (they charged my friend's credit card who was in another room.  So he has been charged twice). . . I almost forgot to mention the nice radio wake up at 6:30AM, volume at the max! I couldn't find a way to turn it off or even turn the lights on (the light switch is at the entrance), so I had to reach the plug! Goddammit room service can't you check that thing when you setup a bedroom???. . I can't see one good thing for the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas... The worse hotel we've ever been! As I said in the beginning, never EVER again!
We stood in the HRH tower for our 1 night trip and boy were we pleased! . The location of the hotel is off the strip, by like 2 blocks...seriously, no big deal. They offer free shuttle service to the mall so it's perfect! . The casino is smaller than those on the strip but it doesn't get over crowded and smokey. . We were able to play the tables for hours without masses of people coming and going. We went to the Showtime Boxing matches they were having at The Joint, ticket prices were cheap and there was not a bad seat in the house! . The room it self was a King City View, Out view consisted mostly of the HRH tower parking structure but no biggie. Bed was amazingly comfy, the couch easily sat 8 people the bathroom was out of this world, sunken tub for two a shower that could fit 3-4 with a "rain" shower head.. Everything about the room was great. It was clean and very spacious. We ordered room service that night and although pricey, service was quick and delish! Check in/out was fine. . The HRH tower has a separate parking structure and Check in Desk that is super PLUSH and really makes you feel like a VIP. Service was a tad slow, with one person at the desk for check in (although we checked in at 9 am) upon check out the next morning at 11, there were 3. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. . We will definitely be back to the Hard Rock for our future visits.
LOVE!. . I've stayed here twice so far, and sure to keep coming back. . . The first time was when my boyfriend and I ditched work during the week and drove up for a few days. You can always find cheap rooms on a Wednesday-Friday, but we had never stayed here so we gave it a shot. $40 a night for a king bed and a view? Hell yes! The room was gorgeous! Not sure if it's because its exactly my taste, but the dark furniture and custom walls with rockstar photos was just awesome. . We are not club people, so being off the strip was not a big deal. I actually like that its off the strip because we like to go visit locals only places and avoid all the traffic of LV blvd.. . Our second visit was when we went to see the Queens of the Stoneage. Two VIP tickets and a room for only $110 total?? That was insane! (tickets alone would have been $100 on ticketmaster). When we checked in the guy accidently charged my boyfriend for an extra ticket. He credited the card right away. It was a bit annoying at first, but we weren't too upset since we were upgraded to a suite! Corner room with wall to floor windows! I can't get over how beautiful the view was!
I think I stayed here 2 times in the past 2 years...I rarely stay here unless I get a great players rate or free room offer...It's a pretty decent hotel...no great restaurants they are okay nothing I would come here for though..... The hotel is clean the rooms are standard but clean as well.. I didn't use the gym but it seemed pretty nice compared to some of the other older hotels.. The dealers are kind and it's a nice atmosphere...just a bit off the strip though.. I would stay again as long as the rates are reasonable....
Really enjoyed the" Rock Star Beer Festival - Gone Country Edition" at The Hard Rock Casino this past weekend & It is always interesting to view the memorabilia on your way out.
Awesome room at the HRH tower! We were pleasantly surprised. I would have given 5 stars except for a few things. We weren't directed to the HRH check in area and instead were greeted by a tired and cranky reception girl that didn't really care too much when I told her it was our honeymoon. I feel it would have been a nicer experience for both of us had she just directed us to the HRH tower check in area which we saw on the way to our room.  Room was plush and comfortable . We had a pool view which was nice.  Sucks that the pools were all closed except for two small ones.  Either way I recommend this for a off strip, luxury feel on a budget. :-)
What was older looking new again!. The HRH seems to be in a constant state of remodeling, expanding, rebranding, etc etc............. It does seem all shiny & new, with lots of new restaurants and so many pools I don't even know how many there are! The Pink Taco has consistently impressive food, and is one place that always impresses on the property.. While "hip" and "young" is not my vibe, I appreciate the upscale look to the bars, some restaurants and the overall casino in order to impress out of town guests. . Also, the 45 & Over "Classic Rockers" club is hilarious, and I can't wait to join next year!!!!!!!!!
Watch out for the  fees. You will be charged everyday for WiFi and a resort fee. You are not allowed to have outside food or drink even in your own hotel room. If you pay out the ass to go to the Rehab pool party do not set foot in the hotel without a shirt on. You will be called out, yelled at and confronted by security. The lines at the front desk are endless. The parking garage is a nightmare. Park at your own risk. They do not consider themselves responsible for anything that happens to their own paying customer's vehicles. Do not let them put you in the Casino Tower. It is the oldest tower and looks it. Half the time you go to one of the bars they are unattended. No bartender needed for no customers. All in all, there are so many other places in Vegas to stay and gamble that treat you like they're glad you're there and they want you to come back. if you want a good time surrounded by fun people  try Planet Hollywood or The Palms or, last but not least , The Cosmopolitan.
Pretty cool, good service, decent rooms, and good food. An overall good experience. Biggest problem is the distance from the strip.
It is a party kind of away from the party. I was here for the 2011 year and did attend a concert for the group Deftones at the Joint. This place is slightly away from the strip. Slightly meaning really long but fun walk from the actual Las Vegas Strip or an 10 or 11 dollar cab ride from my hotel Polo Towers at the time. I would recommend this spot more for 20 somethings, it is very loud. There is also a chance to spot some celebrities in the crowd trying to lay low from the actual strip you know craziness. I Hope to come back here again soon, ASAP. I heard the hotel fees and resort fees are kind of high compared to other places while staying here.
This place is awesome! More of a party type atmosphere which is what I love! Tons of places to eat. Bars spread out all over ther place withdecent prices. Defiantly have some of the better looking cocktail waitresses in Vegas. Got the see one of my favorite Djs in one of their bars, CB Shaw. The pool has the be the best in Vegas for sure! And I would definitely recommend a room with a pool view. The rooms are pretty cool and straight forward. Awesome  bathtub. And I loved the fact that the double doors in the room opened up to a view of the pool and the Vegas strip. Staff is really nice and polite! Parking is free and available!
I avoided Hard Rock for almost three years because it held no appeal to me. I had gone to their restaurant in Chicago, and after a mediocre (at best) experience at their restaurant on the Strip, I decided that the casino couldn't be anything I needed to experience. I was wrong.. . I loved staying at the Hard Rock. All of their rooms are all nicer, and they have all been clean and hip with a little bit of rock and roll. The customer service is great as well, and they have a bunch of perks if you get their player card. My brother-in-law, who likes to gamble and who enjoyed the fun at Rehab (their day party at the pool) his first time at HR, got his room comped when he booked a stay a year after his first HR experience. Room resort + taxes were taken care of, which many resorts don't do when they comp rooms. They were smart for doing this because he did the same thing again when he came back to HR this week.. . The tables are great, the dealers crack me up, some of the pit bosses lack a personality, but overall, gambling at the HR is a lot of fun. Even their machines didn't immediately rob us of our menu when they are programmed to do so. . . Their restaurants recently all updated their menus and now offer gluten free items which is a big plus for me. Also, the restaurants we have gone to offer good service and delicious food. Pink Taco, Mr. Lucky's and 35 Steak and Martinis are scrumptious, and I will be going to Fu (one of their newer Asian restaurants)offers a Half Roasted Duck that is gluten free which is why I'll be going this upcoming weekend; I'm sure the review will be glowing. . . Rehab is an even better experience, but I will write a separate review for that soon.. . Here's a pre-warning: If you like to sleep in in the morning, make sure to get a room that does not face the pool, because if you do you will be awoken early and not be able to fall back to sleep due to pounding music.. . P.S. Their suites are incredible. If you can upgrade for a decent fee, I would do so.
This review is for the "All Suites" HRH Tower... effn' SWEET alright. . . First, the check-in area is so much easier (no lines) and nicer than the other check-in area. Second, it's a whole suite - separate wet bar, living room with wrap around couch, sleeping area, and a bathroom big enough to play baseball in... cuz I just wanna be a big rock star. Okay, cheesy reference... but, you know that no matter how much you hate on Nickelback, ya'll have sung along to SOME part of this song. Anyway, our suite wasn't in the Nickelback theme... we had the Johnny Rotten room. The partial wall that divides the living from bedroom has a flat screen on either side, so you don't have to fight over what to watch. And there's a sound system on the wall where you can choose mood music by genre or just hook up your own ipod and play your own show tunes... nice touch.. . Even though we reserved a King bed, we got two Queen beds... but, we made use of both. One can really put on a show in the bathroom, as it's only divided by the bedroom with a wall of glass. But, there is a large curtain that can be pulled closed- but what's the fun in that? I love that the shower and bathtub are separate, and both are big enough to fit 10 plus me (sorry). Seriously the bathroom, bedroom, and living room are all about the same size. . . This is the perfect room for just a party of 2, or a party of 12. The friend likes it because guests in your room don't have to sit and fart all over your bed... there's plenty of room to fit at least 10 people on that couch!. . For the Hotel/Casino, in general - even though it's a little off the strip, it's pretty much all-inclusive (Rehab, Body English, Pink Taco, Vinyl, and Culinary Dropout)... and, it's stumbling distance to one of my favorite dive bars.
Excellent stay for one night. Everyone we came across was very helpful and friendly!! The room was clean and well maintained. We had used a deal via living social and it worked beautiful, no problems at all. Would definitely stay here again.
Arriving early for check in and much to my surprise they got me right in. I wish I remembered the gals name that checked me in on Friday the 18th of April as she was super friendly and courteous. She welcomed me to stay for Rehab and made me feel welcomed and my room in the paradise tower was beautiful! Thank you Hard Rock for doing it right:)
I must say after reading the reviews before our trip I was pretty nervous about staying there. But to my surprise check-in was reasonable, not too long of lines, plenty of staff working. I did have an expired groupon which was still good for my paid value. The gal didn't know how to do so she went to get help she was gone for about 20min but came back and adjusted everything no problem. We had reserved a king size bed but there were none upon our checking in at 4pm (check in is 3pm) we could have waited who knows how much longer for a king but we were tired and had dinner reservations. The Paradise Tower was very nice! Although our room key was a bit temperamental in the elevator, everything else was great. They do have ice machines which I had read on here (yelp) they didn't. We found what looked like a dried blood stain on our comforter which was disgusting. But management came up and apologized and re-made the bed. Our alarm clock was set for 5pm luckily it was 5pm not am! The Rehab music wasn't too disrupting, only heard slight bass from our room. Although the pool party brought in a lot of young, intoxicated adults security was everywhere on the hotel floor making sure people kept moving along. The Pink Taco was very good! The deli right across from the pink taco though was unimpressive, the customer service was not good and my wildberry smoothie was based out of orange juice and that's all I could taste. At check out there were only two at the counter and a long line, the employees handled the stress of the growing line well.
I come to Vegas every couple of months to visit my mom and have never stayed at the Hard Rock.  I was pleasantly surprised at how nice and comfortable my experience was.  The rooms are large and comfortable with total black out curtains.  The bed feels like a pillow of feathers, top quality bedding that you just sink into!  (And this is just the basic standard rooms in the CasinoTower). . What's also nice about staying here, it's easy to navigate in and out.  It doesn't seem like you are walking miles and miles to get through the casino to your room.. . I was concerned that the rooms would be a let down since I got such a great deal online...$72 (includes all taxes and resort fee). Customer service actually exists here - the employees ROCK!  I would definitely stay here again!
This time I did come to relax and do some partying on the side. This was perfect for my solo spring break adventure. Everyone with the exception of A waitress at lucky 24/7 has been so kind & pleasant. The staff are about hospitality & that's what you expect when you go on vacay. Got a great deal on expedia for flight & hotel. The pool is so nice & the have so many to choose from. The main pool is closed on weekends for Rehab party but there other options. Mon through fri the main pool is 21 & over so no kids to annoy you. Better grown up vibe. I got a room that faced to air conditioning unit & I'm a fresh air type chick. AC hurts my face but when I open the Juliette balcony it's so loud it's super annoying. I think this is my go to spot from now on. The only other epic pools I saw online is flamingo & the age limit there when I walked in was 55& up. Not quite there yet. Until then ill stay here & sing walking around to all the awesome music blaring throughout the hotel.
