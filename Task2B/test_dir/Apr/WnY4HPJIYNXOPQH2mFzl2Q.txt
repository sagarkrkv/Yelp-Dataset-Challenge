We got married in Vegas last weekend and made a reservation at Mandalay Bay. Upon check-in we received an upgrade to The Hotel!  I was thrilled - made our wedding weekend extra special!  The room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom featured a deep soaking tub, double sinks and separate shower.  The atmosphere walking from the casino to The Hotel is like entering a spa - dim lighting, tranquil - an oasis in the midst of Vegas.
I did a two-night 'staycation' here for my wedding and mini-honeymoon. My groom's parents booked the V Suite for us and it was nothing but amazing. It's definitely perfect for romantic getaways. You get a fluffy, king-size bed, a big fat tub just for two and even some matching bathrobes and slippers (mind you, both of these items are as fluffy as their towels--they're really soft to lounge in).. . Along with a huge tub, you also get a nice shower booth decked out in fancy, black marble as well as a huge bathroom countertop (2 sinks) for all you ladies who need room to do your hair & make-up. The bathroom comes with the following: make-up mirror, flat-screen TV so you can catch up on your soaps as you soak in the hot tub, cotton balls, Q-tips, shower gel, soap bar, shampoo & conditioner, and also the motherload: the sewing kit.. . My only complaints about THEhotel are the low-pressure toilet flush on the higher floors, the elevator noises that can possibly wake up light sleepers at night (for me, this wasn't much of a big problem as I'm able to sleep through it), and of course the ridiculous 'resort fees' and cost of chugging down a drink inside your hotel suite (but then again, this has become the standard for most hotels here in Vegas).. . THEhotel suites are definitely an upgrade from their Mandalay Bay counterparts. I've only stayed at the Mandalay once, and if I had to compare, I'd say that THEhotel definitely lives up to its 5-star status.. . I'd love to stay here again!. . (Protip: Keep your hotel key card; front desk allows you to. If you keep it, you're able to still go soak in the Mandalay pools even if you've already checked out. I have a friend who collects hotel key cards and she's done this several times. I tested it myself and I was still able to get some splash at the Mandalay pools even though I checked out 15 minutes before.)
Small but updated rooms. Felt like European if you ask me. If thus is what is available when trying to get something at the Mandalay Bay, don't sweat it, it's a great hotel.
The Mandalay Bay is great if you want a quiet hotel with no casino. The service is generally great there, and you won't have to wait in a long line to check in.. But make sure that you don't stay in a room below the 10th floor, facing the parking lot. The reason why is because they change the pool in the spa once a month, which makes any room from the 1st- 10th floor facing the parking lot smell like a sewer for hours. It happened to me on February 18th, and I had to cover my nose with a t-shirt to fall asleep. Avoid those rooms, and ask for another one if that's what they give you.
Kind of a "meh" for The Hotel these days, they don't seem to be keeping their game up.  The rooms are, as most agree, nicely appointed small suites.  However, THE housekeeping is subpar, we checked in and found a set of car keys and tin of altoids mints on the floor by the bed.  Also, THE furniture sucks.  THE coffee table in the living room had clearly had the leg broken off and was crudely repaired with wood glue oozing out of the cracks.  When I mentioned this to THE front desk representative at checkout, his response was a rhetorical "Really?" indicative of nothing.. . All told, I kind of expected more for almost 300 bucks/night + $25 resort fee.  . . On the pro side, still love the beach, wave pool, and lazy river here. Note: you now must purchase your inner tubes for the lazy river for $22 which doesn't seem that bad compared to what everything else costs in Vegas, lol.. . I suppose the lesson is, don't bother paying more for the dirty suites with broken furniture in THE hotel, as you can use the beach facilities by staying at the cheaper Mandalay Bay.
I found THE Hotel to be less technologically modern than other hotels on the strip, but it was a comfortable stay overall. The rooms were clean and I didn't have the same issue of hearing other people's noise, as some reviews mentioned. Beds were soft and comfy. The size of the rooms and bathrooms were really good compared to other hotels. There is one small bathroom when you walk in, then a good sized living room with a desk, couch, chair, tv and table. The bedroom had plenty of space and the main bathroom had 2 sinks, a shower, bathtub, and enclosed toilet. I wasn't there long so I didn't use the shower but my friends said the water kept switching from hot to cold. When we requested extra towels they were brought up within 10 minutes. . . THE Hotel is connected to Mandalay Bay so you share the casino and all of their pool facilities. There is a somewhat lengthy walk to get to the pools. I wanted to float in the lazy river but couldn't bring myself to spend $22 on a floating tube. The wave pool dispenses one small wave every 90 seconds. So, not too exciting. There is a topless pool for adults and Daylight Beach club. The good thing is if you're going to LIGHT nightclub, the entrance is so close to THE Hotel! In conclusion, as I sometimes say, there was nothing inherently wrong with this hotel but nothing special to make me choose it over others on the strip.
This year my company booked us all into the Mandalay Bay rather than the Luxor. Anything is a significant improvement over the Luxor and I was expecting good things of the Mandalay Bay.. . When I checked in however the front desk person told me that my room was in THEhotel. As with everything at the Mandalay Bay it was about a mile to walk there, I won't even talk about how far the Convention Center is!. . After fighting my way through slot machines and gamblers in various stages of intoxication I found THEhotel entrance. When I got to the room it immediately reminded me of the Luxor - tired, dark and kind of old looking. I was apparently in one of their nicer rooms, a suite no less. It had a tiny sitting room, a slightly larger bedroom and a bathroom. I felt that like Embassy Suites they had stretched the definition of "suite" somewhat. I also found the place quite dusty which didn't add to the overall appeal.. . The bedroom felt small and dark. The bed was comfortable enough but it just felt depressing being in the room. The bathroom looked very dated and I was treated to a blocked sink. The toiletries seemed to be very low quality too, there was no body wash and just a small block of soap.
I booked this hotel because of the suite sz & the access to Mandalay Beach. I was NOT impressed with Thehotel. In fact very underwhelmed. The flower arrangements in the lobby public areas are really nice. The walls are pretty thin. My 10 yr old twins shouldn't have to hear couple above us having mrng sex! I mean every ooh-aahh! Why is there a resort fee if the gym/spa is another $15-25 per day??  Basically you are paying $25/day for wifi. The front desk is not situated right out the elevator doors. This would be helpful as I had restaurant questions often & didn't want to walk down hall to front desk.  The bedding needs updating badly, kinda rough to the touch. Room was on 11th flr, awful view. My daughter complained of a weird smell when entering the hotel each time, I was not bothered by it, smelled like a scented lotion to me. The beach is nice. TIP, bring your own inner tube , hotel charges $20 for an adult sz. Also, the good at beach is overpriced, so are the drinks. I don't feel the Mandalay Bay has good dining choices. We ate at Border Grill for dinner one ngt, good chips, with ok salsa. Food though, wasn't good & it's pricey. Not sure if I'd stay here again. The 2 bathrms were convenient. Best suites in Vegas to me are at the Palazzo.
I had a few of my friends come with me to check in to my room at The Hotel. The staff gave me a selection of rooms to chose from and I selected the highest room with the best view (of course). The said the room would be ready in 30 minutes and they would text me. . 30 minutes went by quickly as we all sat and socialized about our plans in vegas. 30 additional minutes went by before I went up to the front just to check in. They said sorry it will take Another 30 mins. At this point I was frustrated, returning to check in on the eta of the room every 30 mins for another hour and a half. . We got there at 3 so that we could enjoy some pool time but The Hotel had no motivation to see us to our room in a timely matter. We got to our room at 6 after being the only poor looking slumps waiting for their room for 3 hours! . Got to the pool and found out that there were more kids down there then any day at Disneyland. Not a place for adults unless you pay $50 to get into morrea beach. We had fun there at least.
