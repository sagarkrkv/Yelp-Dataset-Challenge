Had a GREAT time at Planet Hollywood! . . This is one of the best locations on the strip for those on a budget. There are tons of $-$$ restaurants within a short walking distance and in the hotel itself. We got a pretty sweet deal directly from the hotel's site. Highly recommend looking for coupon codes and checking out their promotional offers.. . Didn't have any problems with getting extra towels or amenities and the beds were comfortable. Not the biggest rooms but still enough space to play some rage cage and beer pong. (Purely for perspective...ehem...). . I scouted for $5 blackjack tables but to no avail so I parked myself at the no-bust blackjack table and lost $75 WAY too fast...(sad face exit). . But really tho, the all-encompassing convenience of PH is hard to beat. Like the fact that.... . - PBR (Professional Bull Riding) is downstairs and open late so you can ghost ride the bull and crawl back to your room. No cabs. No bullshit. No problem.. - Earl's is downstairs and they're open late. Long lines but efficient process.. - Hellza shopping downstairs.. - Comfortable rooms. No fluff. No bullshit. No problem.. . ....and now, BRITNEY. Haters gonna hate but you know you want a piece of this: http://24.media.tumblr.com/f9e1201d417a3eda75ad66ddd917f091/tumblr_mken20CcUM1ql5yr7o1_500.gif
Sometimes I'm well behaved. But sometimes, just sometimes, I'm a very bad boy. I was in Las Vegas and I had to be naughty. Well what better place to be naughty than every single place I went including my hotel, Planet Hollywood. . . When you're blacked out drunk they don't kick you out or make your friends take care of you like they would at the bars back home. They gently sit you down at a slot machine.. . Awesome.. . The food all over was pretty good, from the daily planet whatever to Gordon Ramsey's BURGR. Had no complaints about the room except for the fact the water pressure was ridiculously low on the shower head and for the sake of all the strippers that are going to be graced with my lap to dance on I really wanted to be extra clean.
This review is for the Sports Book at Planet Hollywood.  I recently stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and spent 4 of those nights in the sports book at some point.  The bartenders, Sherry, Michael and Victor were FANTASTIC!  So friendly and down to earth, always quick with the next drink and the drinks were always mixed perfectly.  Even with the craziness of March Madness, these bartenders were always on and ready to serve.  On quieter nights, my husband and I enjoyed great conversations with all three of them.  This bar is definitely a place we will hang out at again when we are in Las Vegas.  I hope that by the time we come back, they will have gotten new bar stools, though!
Spent the midweek at a safety conference here. Last day a large amount of attendees contracted Norovirus and became violently ill. I will say, however, that before that incident, the room service was actually pretty good, both dinner and breakfast. The blinds in the room didn't completely block out the sunlight in the morning and you can't adjust them  horizontally because of their vertical design. We believe the Norovirus came from the food served at the conference.
Why does the bathroom not have ventilation...? I don't understand.
Checked in and got to room and bed not freshly made. Waited hour and half for housekeeping. She said if you want linens changed daily you have to request it and I told her I just checked in. She gasped. Woke up next morning and power out in bathroom...waited half hour for guy to come up and reset. . No hair dryer in bathroom or room. Not enough electrical outlets. And the most awful stone ages wifi/connectivity anywhere. A total zero of a stay. Never again.
Oh god, where to begin...... . The room was dirty. VERY dirty. The "velvet" headboard had a layer of (I hope) dust, and the bedskirt was stained and disgusting. I sprayed for bed bugs and slept on top of the sheets on the JIC.. . The bathroom was as bad as rest of the room. The floor hadn't been mopped in weeks (at least) as evidenced by the mildewed grout lines, so to be safe I was sure to shuffle around on a towel rather than allow my feet to touch the floor.. . There were splatters on the wall, cobwebs - complete with dead gnats - in the corners, and the window shade was broken and water stained. This was probably a nice hotel 10 years ago, but now it's just the red-headed stepchild of the better hotels. If you're a business traveler like me, you do NOT want to stay at this hotel, nor do you want to bring clients here. It's really for the under 25 crowd that's out to drink, have fun on the Strip and not stay in their rooms for any extended period of time. I felt downright scuzzy the whole time I was there, and couldn't wait to get home and take a long, hot "Silkwood" shower (if you've seen the movie, you get it).. . Next door to me was an obnoxious group of people who snuck a dog into their room. Between the loud arguments and the dog barking, it was tough to get any decent sleep. Down the hall was another stellar group, who took the fighting to a whole new level, spilling out into the hallway at 2am telling each other to f* off. Round the clock fun for all.. . Do the Strip a favor and bulldoze this place!
I love that this hotel is at the center of the strip. It is across Aria and Cosmopolitan, and beside the Paris hotel. Also check-in is at 4 pm, but we checked in early at 1:30 pm with no extra charge! You probably have everything you would need or, at least what you would like to buy inside the Miracle Mile Shops. You got Bath and Body Works if you forgot your soap, you have Victorias Secret if you need a new pair of lingerie, a lot of clothes and shoe stores in case you won and you needed new ones for the trip. . . Food: You got to try Earl of Sandwich! They are open 24/7! . . Casino: I saw first hand the elder gentleman beside me won the progressive jackpot of $15,000.00! Sucked for me, great for him! I loved the strawberry dacquiri- virgin or not, they were pretty good! I loved that they had redbull too to keep you up with your gambling needs, lol! . . Service: It depends. We stayed there for a week. There were nights in were a certain area, the girl in charge there rarely passed. I had to flag down an attendant to call her. There were 2 nights in where the same girl served us at the dollar slot machine area, whereas she was pretty attentive, prompt and very kind. She was my lucky charm too! I won like $600 in both nights in that area with her serving our drinks. . . The Hallway to the Room: Better than Paris at least. The vibe is definitely modern and for the young crowd.. . The Standard Room: Our standard room was on the 37th floor. It was pretty high-up and the view was amazing! We had the mountain view which is the back but the Vegas skyline was glowing at night! . . PROS:. Very nice bedroom set-up. Very modern touch. . All three were separate: the toilet, the tub and the shower. I love the bath tub!  . My room had a table and chair for my laptop, with a lamp on it.. Your wifi connection is free for at least one device. So better decide if you will be using that free wifi for the laptop or your phone.. Flat screen HD tv.. Big closet space.. Big room and decent spacing inside.. Coffee chair and table inside.. Had iron and ironing board inside the closet.. For it's price- the standard room is way better than Paris. Paris feels like a cheap hotel because of the looks of the room and the hallway. It is cheap too! You can get a deal at smartervegas.com. Better than Kayak or Travelocity!. . . CONS:. You pay $25 for the fridge per night.. I noticed some dust on the curtains and on the AC vent.. The toilet is cool that it was separated and has a door for privacy but, someone forgot to include the exhaust fan on the ceiling! Your ish stinks unless you have a candle lit!  There should be at least 2 exhaust fan: 1 inside the toilet room and 1 inside the actual bathroom- to get rid of the smell or the humidity in the air.
Fun little spot and had a blast here! It sure has changed a lot since the Aladdin was taken over.
WTF happened to PH?! I've been loyal to this hotel for years...even when it was Aladdin back in the day!  Customer service is nonexistent in this place! The room was dingy..but I said hmm they are just having a off day...pshh it only gets worse from here.. First off there are red splatter stains on the wall..."Did someone get murdered in this room?" . I noticed the shower had crusty calcium build up...the shower tiles were not very clean...ugggh.. On the first and Last night, I attempted to take a shower, only to find out the water pressure was about as strong as a drinking fountain.. So now I'm annoyed....only to attempt to flush the toilet and find out the damn thing is backed up.. clearly this place has major plumbing issues...mind you is now the middle of the night...just a few moments after the hallway was full drunk skanky strippers yelling and screaming!. . I called the front desk and was told they couldn't move my room....ummm what?! They said they can't control other guest and they could come and plunger the broken toilet.. I opted to check out and go stay elsewhere, but of course they all of a sudden have a better room available?!  After I packed up and booked another hotel!? $& Idiot's!. The front desk check tells me I'm going to be charged for the second night even though I'm leaving...hell no I'm not. . I paid for the first night, and that's about all I'm willing to give this BULL ish hotel! . I'm soo done with PH!
One of my favorite places to stay only because this hotel has everything! Need more clothes? There's a mile long mall. Need a bite? Several places to choose from. I like the Brazilian BBQ place or earls if you're in a rush. Need more groceries? There's an ABC store that has pretty much everything.. This hotel also has a bridge to the Cosmo which comes in handy because I go to marquee at least once.. I want to see Britney! She has residency there so be sure to check her out.. The only thing that sucks is if you stay in the suites it's such a far walk to your car, to the casino, to everything. And when you're hungover everything seems even further.
I am too stuffed to speak. If you walk by this place stop and eat. The ribs were fantastic, the service was great! The seating was so comfortable I was falling asleep.
Here's the thing. The hotel is older. And very confusing for their casino floor. It's not organized where u know where ur going. I have to continuously walk around to find where I'm going. There are better casinos now that are more organized and fun. The women dance on the games at night. I've seen a kid pull out his phone and started video taping the girl dancing. The food is ok but expensive.
Pros:. -central in the strip so you can walk everywhere easily . -rooms are a good size and clean. -free wifi however only one device can use it at a time. -lots of shopping malls . -earls sandwich is inside . . Cons: . -shower head and toilet paper roll were broken after a little usage. -you have to walk through the "miracle mile" of shops for the parking lot just to get to the lobby. There was no quicker or safer way to get there.
I love this hotel, plain and simple! I have stayed here few times and twice within the past few months. .  . Starting with the rooms: They are decent size rooms, although I have only stayed in the ones with the king beds, they are very comfortable and spacious. The bathrooms are large with their own shower stall, separate jacuzzi tub, and toilet also separate. There is also a large counter and sink, perfect for multiple people to get ready. If you're lucky enough to get the rooms facingthe strip, they scenery is awesome. The Bellagio is right across the street, so you don't even have to leave the room to watch the fountain show or fight for a good spot! The rooms are themed from famous actors or singers and they have some cool memorabilia for show.. . Casino: I really like that the decorations are vibrant pink hue colors and crystals all over the lighting, it is very appealing to me being a very feminine lady. Over the one section of the blackjack tables is called the Pleasure Pit, all it is are go go dancers in pink costumes dancing. Sometimes they look like they're having fun and into it, and some girls look like they want a new job (liven up, ladies!) other than that, your typical updated, run of the mill casino. The cocktail waitresses are going downhill a bit. I could understand if the washed up older ladies worked the day shift, but there were quite a bit of those in the later evening, not to mention quite rude as well.. . Just like a typical Vegas trip, I was not really in the hotel much, so I did not  have the chance to check out the other facilities.. . The manager brought my boyfriend and I a complimentary bottle of champagne, which was so sweet and much appreciated.
Room is very bland, but big.  It is as if the decorator just gave up halfway through.  We were upgraded to the suite, which in hindsight appears to be a bad decision because the suite size while larger was filled with many crazy angled areas that were not suitable for walking through.  . . A rounded toilet room had a huge space that had nothing occupying it.  Strange right?  Maybe I can put stadium seating in that space so people can cheer you on while you do your business?  There is a tub AND shower in the bathroom as well, which is nice.  The biggest waste of space was the office.  It was there for me to do business or homework I imagine?  I don't care if not doing my homework at vegas will cause me to flunk out...I will not do homework at vegas.  I think you get kicked out of the city if you do homework there.  So....what is the point of the office?. . Also, the casino is so dark it feels like the manager is trying to save money on the electric bill.  Also, the water pressure is low in this place.  I think when you flush or turn on water a guy has to spit in the pipes to get things going.  It is as though gravity does not exist in the hotel and water must fight to make its way through the pipes.  Come on water!  You can do it!  Hey....maybe that is what the stadium seating is for in the bathroom....a cheering section for the water pressure.. . So...in conclusion:. 1) Crappy decorating (definitely not Hollywood although it had a piece of paper framed on the wall supposedly from some movie I never heard of). 2) Wasted space....an office you will never use and stadium seating in the bathroom you shouldn't use.. 3) Priced way too high for the little you receive. . My recommendations:. 1) Clean Room?. 2) Nice to look at Room?. 3) Cheap Room?. 4) Located in the heart of the strip?. . Then choose the Flamingo.  IF you want a room that has the four items listed above and a great view of the fountains...but maybe a bit nicer...then choose Paris.  DO NOT choose Planet Hollywood.
Planet Hollywood is, in my opinion, one of the coolest hotels on the strip. It has an awesome casino vibe, plenty of shops, great rooms, and I hear good food although I actually didn't try the food in Planet Hollywood.. . The casino floor is quite a bit nicer than say Ballys or any of the other older casinos. And I think it has a much better vibe than Paris or Cosmo (next door/across the street). Plenty of tables although usually they're $10 not $5 tables. I found the dealers to be a pretty enjoyable group of people and never had issues. . . But the hotel's the best part. The rooms are large and the beds are very comfy. Even the standard rooms are quite spacious, but upgrade to the next tier and the rooms are very large with massive bathrooms - bathrooms so big they carpet part of the floor. . I stayed at Planet Hollywood a number of times and the only time I had an issue - I got back from work (yes, actually work) at 3am only to find I was locked out of my room due to some issue with the pipes (it affected a couple rooms near me as well). So I had to go downstairs, figure out the issue, go back upstairs, get my stuff, go to some other room all after working for like 20 hours that day. Not happy. When I stayed there the next week, I brought this up and got upgraded. They handled it fairly well I think although it did take some negotiating and stubbornness on my part.
Second time staying at this hotel and it was great both times. Rooms are clean, modern. so many restaurants to choose from inside the Miracle Shopping Mall attached to it. Check in and out was a breeze. I love that its in the middle of the strip which in my opinion is a great place to stay when visiting Vegas because you in the middle of everything. If you are considering staying here do so you will thank yourself later.
I stayed at the Planet Hollywood from 4-20-14 to 4-23-14.  Overall experience was really between a two and three star.. The Highlights.  Excellent Check In service, Excellent Bellmen service, excellent Room service.  The Lowlights.  Tacky solicitors for on sight sales at the front entrance of the Casino and on the main thoroughfare of the Casino floor.  Most guest really despise this.  They also have problems with some table dealers trying to give unsolicited advice on how to play a table game.. The rooms seem a bit dated and not in perfect condition. The mattresses are too hard for my taste and the layout of the room is "odd" at best. More updating needs to be done for this hotel.. Overall, I don't think this is a 4 star Hotel.......more likely a 3 star.
Stayed at Planet Hollywood for the first time this past weekend. Usually stay at Caesars, but decided on a change. We got tired of the inadequate service at Caesars, even though the rooms are great.. . This hotel is awesome. At first, the hotel Valet was "full". But after we told them we were hotel guests, they immediately took our car.. . The front desk agent was awesome upon check-in. Being a totals reward member, we get comped standard rooms and sometimes upgraded rooms, but he went above and beyond and upgraded us to a strip-view suite, free of charge. We were originally only staying Friday/Saturday night. So, a great start. . . The room was really nice. Separate bedroom with huge wall to wall windows overlooking the Cosmo/Bellagio fountains, plus we were able to look down and see the hotel pool and across the way at the Cosmo pool. Beds are super comfy. There bathroom was palatial, almost like a room on it's own. One room with a sink and a dressing area and another room with a shower, tub and another sink/dressing area. Hidden toilet with separate door. I loved the sunken tub which had a massive window over-looking the Cosmo/partial strip. Plus there was a huge flat screen over it in case you didn't want to look out thewindow. . . The only negatives about the rooms were that since the pool was right below us, we could hear the music during the afternoon while we were trying to sleep in (so much for sound-proofed windows). Also, there's not that much ventilation in the bathrooms, so when you have to... Ahem... "Go", the smell stays in the bathroom for a while. But other than that, it was a great room. . . We checked out out on Sunday, then re-checked right back in after deciding to stay another night. Since the suite was no longer available, we were offered a standard strip-view room. It was nowhere as big as the suite, but still very well-appointed and had a nice window with a view of the Bellagio-Fountains. The bed was just as comfortable. It's also nice to see that the sunken tub is offered with all rooms, albeit without the huge window/flat screen tv. . . The hotel also has a great mall inside of it, if that's your thing. At night, they have great music in the Casino and a younger crowd (20's to mid-30's). Plus for all the guys out there, they have almost-naked women dancing on tables everywhere. (I had a hard time keeping my husbands eyes from roaming). Lots of great restaurants in PH as well.. . Overall, a wonderful experience at a pretty awesome hotel.
I only went onto the casino floor here. Overall the casino looks really nice with a good variety of tables wih there nightclub entrance overlooking the casino floor. The one downfall was that they have dancers on a stage in the middle of the tables. I wasnt sure if the were females or males dressed as females...
Here for a speaking engagement so I thought I'd stay right in the center of the strip.  Glad I did.  The Miracle Mall is a gold mine with the ABC store a great source for liquor, toiletries and late night snacks.  A visit to Sin City Brewery is a must - try the Octoberfest!  Great staff there - thanks Joe!  The Blackjack dealers were friendly for the most part.  Unfortunately you will only find 6/5 payout on Blackjack if you are playing the $15 tables.  I moved to the $25 tables for real Blackjack.  Great food choices and the pool area is great to take in some sun.  Will return.. . Pros:. location. staff. food options. mall. . Cons:. expensive comparatively speaking. 6/5 Blackjack
I booked my stay at this resort through Southwest Vacations. I picked this one because of the location. I have been to Vegas several times before and really like the location of Planet Hollywood. We stayed there 4/21 - 4/25. I had not stayed there before or been in any of the rooms. After we booked the trip, I read the reviews on yelp and I was concerned about what the experience would be like. Well, I was extremely satisfied with the resort and very happy with the room. . . The room had a king sized bed, a soaking tub, separate shower, separate room for the toilet and bidet, and two sinks with ample counter space. The water pressure in the bathroom was strong. The resort fee ($22.40) includes use of the fitness facility and Internet for two devices. The policy recently changed to allow two devices to access the WiFi for each room. Previously, only one device was included in the resort fee. The WiFi was very fast and reliable. . . The check-in experience was smooth and efficient. We were upgraded to a larger room with an absolutely incredible view of the Strip, Paris, and The Bellagio. The room itself was immaculate. It wasclean and there were no fingerprints on windows or other things that people in other reviews mentioned. We used the shower right when we got there and realized that the drain was not working properly in the shower or one of the sinks. I called maintenance about this problem and someone was at our door within 5 minutes! After about 15 minuets working on the problem, the drains were fixed. I have never had such a prompt response time at a hotel before. . . The bed was very comfortable. Although we were on the Strip side, there was no noise from the street. The housekeeping service was thorough every day. I have no complaints. . . I found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. I will recommend Planet Hollywood to friends and I will stay here again. I have stayed at the Cosmopolitan twice and the Tropicana once. Planet Hollywood has the best location (the Miracle Mile mall is a big plus!). There is a Walgreen's right next door. The mall has a couple of ABC shops (liquor and souvenirs) and the prices are reasonable. . . All in all, I was very impressed with the resort. It's like I was staying at a different place than those people who gave very low ratings. I have nothing but good things to say about PH. I wonder if the competition paid them to write those reviews.
Planet Hollywood has a Meh-to-OK rating in my book. Since I'm being generous, I'll give them a three star rating. This hotel has some good, some bad, and some ugly. I guess I'll start with the good and go from there. . . Good:. *Middle of the strip location. . . *Connected to Miracle Mile shops and eateries. . . *Each room has a different theme. Ours was Star Treck. . . *Room amenities (bed, TV, bathroom, etc) are middle of the road. Not the best, but not bad either. For as little time as we spent in the room, it worked for us.. . *Couple of decent pools with Black Jack tables in the pool area. Score! Sun, water, booze and gambling? Can't beat that!. . *The Casino connected to the hotel was nice. They had a lot of awesome dealers and I really liked that. . . *Decent prices for the rooms (compared to other hotels that are comparable to PH). . . *...that's about it on the "good". . . Bad:. *They charge you extra for gym access. Why? I wanted to work out one day to work off all the calories I was consuming, but couldn't justify paying extra for what was probably a small and not impressive gym room.. . *They charge you extra for WiFi. No wonder my phone's internet barely worked....they probably wanted me to pay extra for WiFi. That didn't happen either. . . And now the ugly...this is where this hotel gets not so great stars in my book:. *Two months prior to our trip -- My party of 8 came here for my boyfriend's sisters birthday. My boyfriend booked four king sized bed rooms two months in advance. He also requested that all four rooms be on the same floor. . . *One month prior to our trip -- My boyfriend called the hotel to double check that all four rooms will be on the same floor. The staff that answered said that they'll put the request in and it shouldn't be an issue. Awesome. . . *Day of check in -- Check in is 4pm. We got there at 3:30pm, only to be told that all our rooms won't be on the same floor and that all of the rooms would only have queen sized beds. To get king sized beds, we'd have to pay an extra $50 for an "upgrade" (even though we booked king bed rooms). The staff proceeded to tell us that we didn't get all our requests met because we were checking in "late", even though we were there 30 MINUTES BEFORE CHECK IN! We were floored. Especially since the lady who was helping us was rude beyond belief. She was giving us attitude and wouldn't accommodate us on anything. Hello! We booked our rooms way in advance and got to the hotel before check in. Also, it also took us 45 MINUTES to check in! What! Really? Why? Is checking in four rooms that difficult? It really should only take 15 minutes max. Plus, we saw about six families check in while we were being checked in. Frustrating. . . *End result -- two couples in our party decided to upgrade and pay the extra $50. The other two parties who didn't upgrade were stuck with two queen sized beds with a shitty view. One couple in our party was put on a separate floor too. The three rooms that were on the same floor weren't remotely close to each other either. . . *The day after we checked in -- my boyfriend decided to complain about our check in process to a manager. The manager either couldn't, or didn't, defend what had happened. The manager did extend our check out time from 11am to 1pm on the day we were checking out. It was the least he could do, but I don't think it was enough to justify what had happened during check in. . . All in all, I'd give PH a higher rating since I thought they were a pretty solid hotel. What pissed me off was the whole room situation and checking in. It could have been handled so much better and oh so differently. Because of that, 3 stars only from me for this hotel!. . Cheers!
Good lord. The only good thing about his hotel is the location. I mean it, that's the only good thing. We stayed here for my Bachelorette party, there were 20 of us. Checking in took us 30 minutes. No joke. It was really difficult for us to get 5 rooms on the same floor and have 2 sets of 2 rooms that adjoined. Even though we had requested this from the beginning (booked 4 months in advance) and we checked in on a Thursday (shouldn't have been too busy). When we left the front desk the line was insane! There were only 4 people checking people in and the line had to have been 30 people deep. I felt terrible! We also had to have a rollaway bed in one room. Thatwas $30 a night-insane!. . The customer service in the casino and the hotel was pretty much non-existent. We asked many times for them to open Blackjack tables for us so we could gamble. Usually our request is granted since we are a bunch of good looking girls who will probably be giving the hotel all of our money-not serious gamblers! But nope, one pit boss directed us to the other pit boss who told us that we had been mistaken and it wasn't possible. They sent us to Paris and Bally's. Do you normally send that many people to gamble elsewhere? Are you dumb?. . There's no clubs in Planet Hollywood and "Rock Bar" is the most ghetto place I have ever been in my life. Sweet Jesus, I am from Chicago, and that place gives some dive bars I've been to a run for their money. Avoid at all costs!!!!. . Earl's is good, but the line is always sooooo long. Sugar Factory was pretty good, overpriced of course, just like everything else in Vegas ;) We also ate at Yolo's one night. It was good, not great, the service was sub par-they messed up so many orders.. . We stayed here mainly because Britney Spears was there and we went to her show. Would I stay here again? No way. Like I said, the location is nice, and that's it. Take your money elsewhere!
I loved this place, though if I'm being totally honest I didn't spend a whole lot of time here.. . I always find it amazing how American companies find a way to make you pay for everything, room with a view? That's extra ($20 per night PLUS tax). Bigger room? Extra. Fast pass to skip the que, extra... Where will the madness end! :O. . Anywhoo, we paid for the view & were glad we did since it was our first time in Vegas, but talk about disappointing. We had a tiny window & could see from the edge of the bellagio (not the fountains either) right up to the end of the strip, it was amazing. Though a balcony or a bigger window would have been better appreciated. The rooms themselves were lovely, very comfortable bed (although we didn't do much sleeping), good sized wardrobe & TV & the bathroom was magnificant with a giant power shower & big bath tub & separate cubicle for the toilet.... . The pool area was great, although I only just saw it, never spent any actual time there... Just too busy seeing the rest of Vegas!. . The real winner for this hotel in my opinion is it's location. The hotel is literally smack bang in the middle of the strip and attached to one of the better shopping malls I had seen in hotels (the one in Ceasers is bigger, but too big for me. I spend 90 minutes on the second floor of their shopping mall without even going into a shop because I couldn't find my way back out!). There was also all the different food options right on the hotel grounds (PF Changs, Pinks, Pin-up pizza, and lots lots more in the mall). If you do visit planet Hollywood go try The Spice Market Buffet. Oh my GOD, breakfasts here were to die for, but if you manage to get there at bruch ask for a mimosa to go with it... Delish. (p.s. if you go to a buffet for breakfast ask for the 24 hour pass, only about $10 more & opens 7 different buffets for you for the day all included).. . The hotel suited the kind of holiday we were on perfectly. We were a gang of messy, happy drunks who just wanted a good time & the PH staff were fantastic at putting up with us & getting in on the banter. We didn't get the same impression from staff at other hotels.. . Why am I docking a star? What would I change? The theme to be honest! Although I understand the theme is "Planet Hollywood" & this theme was executed perfectly with the glamourous go-go dancers & beautiful dealers in corsets & hotpants and the movie memorabelia in each bedroom, having been to see the other hotels I was left feeling a little bit like I had missed out. Every other hotel has a sense of grandure that I didn't quite get from PH. Again, as I said, their theme was perfectly executed & a big extravogant casino like the others would not have fit in with Planet Hollywood and as I also said, this suited us for the type of holiday we were on.. . If I was to visit Vegas again with a group, this would be the hotel for me. If it was just myself & my Fiance it would probably be somewhere different to give us the fancy experience.
Rooms are nice, but pretty small.  I DO like the pool here, hence the 4 stars. If you're a guest, you can go for free. And the DJs spinning there aren't bad either. Plus, PH is in the center of the strip.  Very convenient.. . Also, ceck out the bookelt that comes with your room key.  There's a coupon for 2 for 1 cocktails...that means 2 cocktails for $15.
