At the time I got my 3rd seaweed salad,  I was going to give this place 5 stars. However, my eyes can always handle more than my stomach. I took off a star because they don't allow you to waste good, meaning that you HAVE TO EAT EVERYTHING you order. So for those that are greedy, please heed my warnings and DO NOT OVER ORDER. Otherwise I feel like the all you can eat option is much better than ordering individual rolls, unless you're watching your figure. If you're craving sushi in Vegas, come here to get your fill.
This restaurant is really good! We were greeted and seated right away even though the restaurant was very busy. Food came out in a timely fashion. Sushi was delicious along with tempura and pork curry. I like the fact that even though this restaurant is located off of the strip it has 5 star quality! A hidden gem for he locals.
The sushi was alright. The service I received was horrible!!!! I came here on Sunday night and I ran into a group of people very upset due to some issues they had inside and that probably should have been my first indicator to turn around. I walked in and the hostess looked and me didn't greet me and walked off to talk to a table she then came back and still did not acknowledge us I still was too bothered and thought maybe she's just really busy. We finally sat down and had to wait 15min for someone to come over to get our drink order. Once the waiter came over we also gave our food order because we didnt want to wait another 15min and that was the 1 and only time we saw our waiter I had to ask the hostess for the bill. The customer service here is nonexistent and I will never be back. I should have gone to Yama Sushi.
The quality of the fish and food is extremely fresh. My only problem with this place is that the waiter would never come by to refill waters or take any extra orders. I had to wave down a busser who I thought would get our waiter for us but ended up taking our order and it took 20 minutes for the items to come and missed one of our orders as well. The restaurant is small so that made me more irritated as to how does a waiter not come and do their job more often? Im just glad they didn't push the time limit disclaimer. Food was great, just step up the service please.
I love how this AYCE sushi restaurant doesn't have a time limit, at least I don't think so. . . They have a really good menu that includes takoyaki and yakitori (grilled chicken) along with other non sushi items. The takoyaki were super crispy on the outside, but there was a tiny tiny tiny piece of octopus inside. It was good, but I wish there was more octopus! The yakitori was perfectly seasoned. The rice to fish ratio was decent. I LOVE HOW YOU CAN ORDER HALF ROLLS HERE!!! We got to try a lot of different rolls, I don't remember which ones I liked because we kept on ordering but the salmon nigiri melts in your mouth! . . Our server came by quite often to ask us if we wanted to order more. Our food came out at a good pace, and we didn't have any left overs! . . Make sure to save room for their green tea creme brulee. They also have a really good chocolate mousse. All their desserts are small portions, so you'll be able to order and sample everything if you'd like. . . Just a heads up, expect a wait if you come around 6 or 7. The restaurant isn't very big. Also, their water tastes weird.
One of my favs for sushi in Vegas. Service is fast. Sake selection is delicious. Sushi bar is a plus if you don't want to sit down at a table.
AYCE sushi for $27 for dinner is well worth the money. There is a time limit for an hour but that was more than enough time to stuff myself silly with sushi. It took forever for the hostess to seat us as we waited about half an hour to sit at the bar. For dinner, you are limited to one order of uni and sweet shrimp per person. There are so many options for sushi and rolls (you could get half orders). Check out the specials on the chalkboard because those items aren't on the menu. Save room for dessert! The lychee sorbet was my favorite.
Love love love sushi Goyemon! My friends and I always do "all you can eat" and we like to sit at the sushi bar. Sushi chefs are doing a really good job. We have been there many times and their fish is always fresh and tasty. Lemon roll is my favorite along with salmon & avocado hand rolls. This place is always packed and they don't except reservations, so my suggestion is to go there, put your name down and come back. It is usually 30-45 mins wait.
Lovely AYCE selection! . One of the better AYCE places around. Be sure to order everything off the specials chalkboard... . Oh and you can order more than one dessert... whhhaaaaaaattttttttt
Where did the crowds go?oh a cockroach now I know,this place has gone downhill fast,used to be my favorite
Tried this place for the first time tonight.  Will DEFINITELY be back.  The basics that me & my hubby usually get at sushi places (tuna poke, seaweed salad, miso, etc) were very good if not BETTER than their equivalents at the other 5 or so sushi places we've tried here in Vegas. We ate at the bar and our sushi chef (I think his name was Juan, a young Hispanic man) was very attentive, polite and intelligent.  He was taking multiple orders from multiple customers at once and getting them all out quickly and accurately.  Plus, he told us something we've never hear at a sushi place before: that we could add or subtract whatever we want from the rolls on the AYCE menu and he would make them to order.  How awesome is that!. And I loved that this place had many rolls with ingredients you don't see every day at the other places in town.  And all the new ones we tried were very tasty.  Oh, and there were some unique items on the dessert menu too which were also delicious!. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is that the servers were kind of slow.. But we would definitely return for "Juan" and sit at the sushi bar!!!
This is one of my favorite sushi places in Las Vegas. And that is saying something because there are A LOT!. . Great AYCA menu. Lots of options and the food is always fresh. The food comes out really fast so you can order small amounts as you go (Which in my opinion is the best way to eat AYCA). . The apps are soooo delicious.. Best steamed gyoza and shumai in town! . . Their Moon roll and their Caterpillar roll are both fantastic. . . Plus you can finish it all with tempura ice cream! . . And Try the green tea brulee. It's really great!
Service is the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars.. . I LOVE Goyemon!! The food here is always on point! Salmon belly is my new winner it just melts in your mouth. I can't say I've had anything I didn't like and my friend even had all you can eat chicken, hahaha.. . So prior to coming I've been spending a lot of time on yelp and looked up Goyemon's and checked out how could they possibly get bad reviews?! Well last week when I came the hostess with a lack of a smile claimed they were on an hour wait. Looking around and bodies waiting and tables available that hour wait did not add up. But since I've never seen a manager I figured they're gonna let this girl lose their business, and we left. Last night, a party of 8. The server did not smile once and was not having it. Funny because all of us just got off work from SERVING!! On top of it he rarely came to the table to help with our order or even check for satisfaction when one of the girls was missing a few things. I let it be known he sucked and was rude and my girlfriend made a mission to make this guy smile... Sadly only took a sexual innuendo to see those lips smirk.. . So sad that such a great place for years lets this happen... Especially if there are multiple reviews claiming bad service. Plenty of good servers and I'm sure I know a few!!
If you like a ball of rice with a tiny fraction of a slice of fish on top. This is your spot. Used to be good. The business model at many " ayce" restaurants in Vegas, is to offer descent to good sushi, then systematically pull the reigns in on size and quality of sushi. When everyone wises up and flees to the next spot, they will put up a sign that says under new management and start the cycle over again. Just leave and let the restaurant die. Goymon falls in this category.
Goyemon used to be our absolute favorite place, we would eat here about 4 times a week since it is also close to home. But in the past few months something happened... The service became bad, the portions smaller (we almost always order ala carte), occasionally the fish is very warm. I keep hoping it will change back to how it once was, perhaps they cannot handle their popularity. Goyemon was great but right now it is a solid 2 - 2.5 stars.
My friend and I stopped in for some dinner since the place was highly recommended. . . The wait for 2 was longer then expected the AC was up so high it was uncomfortably cold to enjoy the atmosphere.  The service was pretty bad, I understand they were busy but no one came to check on us, refill our drinks, or take our order every time we wanted to. I had to flag down someone every time which made me feel uncomfortable. The food was very dry, had no flavor, the portions of the salads and appetizers were tiny like in sauce dishes. . . I won't recommend it and actually even at the end of our dinner my friend and I said at the same time that we definitely won't be coming back again.
I was craving late night sushi a few months ago and hopped on yelp to hopefully find a place.and this is how I tried this spot. Walked in and was surprised this place was so busy but was excited since that usually means its good. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I was greeted by 3 very friendly sushi chefs. This is the reason I keep coming back. The sushi chefs are always inviting and will help you with any questions you have!they are awesome! The sushi quality is pretty good as well!always super fresh tasting and so much variety!now for the reasons I give only 3 stars. the first time I dined there, I was charge $2.75 for soda WATER....that's just tap water with bubbles.never in my 12 years of being in the service industry have I ever Been charged or charged a Customer for tap water with some C02. When I asked the manager he had no explanation for me and said "yeah it's just like that and there's a charged for it." Now if I was the manager of a nice sushi Resturant I would respond with "yes ma'm there is a charge for water with bubbles here but since it's your first time and you didn't know I would be happy to make an exception and remove it off your bill this time" whatever dude my bellys fool of delicious sushi. and I'm not in the mood to end my night poorly over some bubbles.....I'll just order regular tap next time....last thing is I've been to this place at least 4 times now and only last night was I asked if I had an AYCE stamp card....ummm no I don't because I was never asked in the first place....the servers need to communicate with eachother more and I think the manager needs some tips on hospitality.....
I have been determined to find real Takoyaki.  That's why I tried this place out.  I was disappointed.  I'm pretty sure theirs was thrown in the deep fryer, which is not the way real Takoyaki is made.  It's also more mochi-like (sticky rice) rather than batter pancake-like & didn't come with the white sauce, mayo or usual garnishes. . The caterpillar roll came out looking like sloppy.  Definitely not $10 worth.  The rolls we got overall tasted decent/average.  The sesame chicken was so dry and flavor less, I had to ask for teriyaki sauce to drizzle over it.  The Green Tea Brulee was so small, the pictures are deceiving, it didn't have a hard shell on top, but it tasted great.. I probably won't be going back there again.  They have a lot of competition in this town, if you know what I mean.
I haven't tried all AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas but I've experienced some pretty bad to mediocre ones. With that, I'm pretty confident that my opinion of Sushi House Goyemon being one of the best AYCE sushi in Vegas holds water. I like my sushi simple, fresh and nigiri-style. Not really big on sauced-up rolls (which they also serve). Because of Goyemon, why would I go and overspend at places like Blue Ribbon Sushi? Most of the fish that comes to Vegas is frozen, right? They also claimed one night that their uni was from Santa Barbara. One order of uni per person for AYCE is still a steal!. . The service is a bit slower than some local AYCE restaurants and the wait time can be ridiculous if you're there at peak dinner hours. But I take busy as a good sign that people are recognizing something special in Goyemon. They also offer other delectable fare like grilled pork belly and desserts you should definitely make room for. There are the cutest tiny servings of green tea creme brulee and chocolate mousse you must try, also part of AYCE. Make sure to check their board for the specials of the day. And don't forget to get your stamp card if you're planning on becoming a regular.
Fresh sushi!!!!!!  the only bad things is the size and wait of this place. Come hungry . Nom nom nom nom
I am glad we read the reviews on this place and chose it over the other place nearby. They were spot on. the ayce sushi was great. lots of specialty rolls and selection. the service was fast and fresh and they even have a stamp program for those who are locals and come by often. we were only in town for the weekend and craving sushi and this hit the spot. the only downgrade was the miso soup and salad just a little bland for my taste. would recommend this spot to others.
I really liked the really fast service! The small portions were great! I really liked that since most people at other AYCE sushi places load up there rolls with a crazy amounts of rice in it the meal is hard to enjoy. I dont feel as if they do that here. The service was awesome and so was the sushi. The only thing I did not like was the salad and the dressing.
Love this place!  Used to go to Sushimon on Silverado and Maryland.  But since they opened this location. This is my go to place for AYCE! . . They have good quality food.  AYCE pretty much everything.  Even the desserts are all you can eat.  Tempura ice cream, mochi, green tea creme brulee.  Yum!  . . My boyfriend is from Long Beach, and everytime he comes to town, he has to come here for sushi.  . . The staff is great!  Hiro, Geo, and Ivan are always so accommodating, they know exactly what I like and the service is always fast.  Food is so good.  Sushi is fresh.  They have daily specials, different types of nigiri.  They have ramen served after 11pm, but the Udon is good too!  Always consistent!  That's what I love about this place.  . . Love love this place!  They have a stamp card, buy 10, get one meal free!. . Love me some Goyemon!
Everything was pretty good. Garlic tuna tasted like Garlic had nothing to do with it. Our server was good. Heard a couple bad stories about a rude server there, whatever. The hostess was ok.
I walked in and the workers walked past me and never greeted our party. I had to finally ask to get help. Then I find out the all you can eat is limited to one hr. Not worth my time.
This place was highly recommended but my party of 3 immediately walked out  - lack of customer service, no greeting. The servers at the podium didn't take the time, so we didn't want to either. Total turn off in my book. I like to think I am pretty patient but perhaps working for a 5 star resort/restaurant made me a "snob". Oh well...Decided to get sushi elsewhere. Oyshi greeted us the moment we walked in!
We arrived around 9:30-10pm. We were seated promptly and our server was good. She took our order and got our drinks quickly. We started with garlic tuna, cajun albacore,  sweet ebi, and the tamago. The garlic tuna could have used more garlic as I thought the garlic was lacking. The cajun albacore was good. Tasted like some seasoning I had in my spice cabinet but good. The sweet ebi was also good. The tamago could be alot better, seemed as though the egg had been folded over each other to make the shape instead of being prepared that way to begin with.  We then moved on and had the orion, domingo, and the tiger rolls. The orion was good the cajun albacore made that roll spicy yet very tolerable, the domigo had to be my favorite.  The salsa that it was topped with was awesome and was a different twist from what ive had in the past. The tiger was ok. Nothing to crazy.  We then had the crispy rice, lasagna, and the spider rolls.  The spider roll was good. The soy paper was soft and the crab crunchy, very good! The crispy rice and lasagna was no spot light and was very heavy rolls with mayo, eel sauce, that just made the rolls not so appealing.  Overall place was a good time, decent food, and good service.
I love hamachi! And as much as I ate tonight would have been far more expensive than the all u can eat price. I sat at the sushi bar and the chefs were great! My favorite was Ivan he was the only one to bother to make small talk. My server wasn't the best *shrug* I didn't let him ruin the entire experience. I'll definitely be back
No customer service at all.. Service is really bad. I will never go there anymore waste my time n money.
