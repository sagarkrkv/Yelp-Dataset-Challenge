Hands down best dessert of my life. Great menue, great prices and wonderful service.. A must if you are in the area, you will be sure not to regret it. And beware the portions are huge!
Saddens me that I've been trying to go this place for over a year now, and when I finally go, I find out they're closing down for good this month :'( I'm glad at least we got to try 'em before they did (went on 3/26/14).. . This chocolate haven is decadently amazing. Came here for breakfast; all the food my friends and I ordered here last week were so delicious. The food was flawless. Portion size, tastes, service (btw our lady server was super sweet; she exchanged my hot cocoa free of charge when I didn't like it!) were spot on even though they would close in a few days time. (See my pics! :). . The fatty that I am ordered a Mexican hot chocolate with dark chocolate essence. It was a bit too bitter for my taste, so opted for the regular milk hot chocolate instead in that cute HUG MUG! I cupped it between my hands and sipped away! hahah. I also got the Lazy Breakfast and shared the Strawberry Hazelnut Crepe with my friend. SO MUCH FOOD, but all so perfect. I was stuffed, but the good kind of stuffed. The "pure melted chocolate lick" was basically a melted choco sauce. It complimented the sugar biscuit very well along with the soft butter in my breakfast dish. The CREPE. Wow. I think this may just be the best crepe I've ever tasted!!! It was perfectly crisped, perfect crispness. And the ganache sauce in the flask, drizzled over the crepe was too good to be true.. . My friends got a steak panini which I didn't get to taste-test, but they said it was delish too. I did try, however, those Chili,Cocoa dusted Waffle Fries! The girls were afraid it would be like sweet fries, but low and behold, they were the best seasoned fries we've tried! . . Well my friends, looks like if you wanna try some Max Brenners, gonna have to try 'em at the plentiful locations in the East Coast (damn you New Jersey for taking away the Vegas location)!!  Or other worldwide locations like in Japan, Russia, Australia. lol random imy.  If only they'd open one here in LA, I'm absolutely sure they'd be a hit! Yes, they're on the higher side for prices, but it's totally worth it if the food's this scrumptious. I'll crave you always Max Brenners!
It is a real shame this place has closed down. They had a killer happy hour and their chocolate martini was like nothing I've had before. I didn't intend on buying any chocolate when I stopped in, but I sampled their chocolate covered pecans and it was some of the best candy I have had in a long time and I had to buy a box. I'm glad I got to try it when I did.
DELISH!!!!! I'm known for my huge sweet tooth and after stopping in two days in my three day stay in Vegas I am hooked!!!
