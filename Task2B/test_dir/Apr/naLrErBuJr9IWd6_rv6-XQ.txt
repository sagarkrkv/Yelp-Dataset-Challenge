I can't say enough good things about CUT. I've eaten at nearly every steakhouse in Las Vegas and countless others around the world and CUT has joined the top of my list. A modern chic upscale vibe with a staff that is extremely detail oriented and knowledgable. Started with the steak tartare which was perfect and had the American Wagyu filet for the main. The steaks were cooked to perfection. I will be back time and time again.
Visited here Christmas 2012. Everything was wonderful. There were 5 of us who all got a different cut of steak and they were all tender and delicious. The bearnaise sauce was fabulous. My daughter and son in law both had the truffles shaved over their steaks. I am a considered a weirdo in my family because I hate truffles and I don't like foie gras. Everyone else would have them put into everything. But I would highly recommend cut to everyone.  Service was great night we were there.
Aged Bone in Rib eye.. is all I have to say about that!
This restaurant is awesome.. My better half and I spent a wonderful weekend in Las Vegas and stayed at The Palazzo. Coming to this restaurant was just too convenient to pass, and the fact that it is a Wolfgang Puck restaurant made it that much more of a desirable dinner choice. . We were sat very quickly and within minutes we had a wine menu in front of us. We both chose a Malbec that was so amazing!!!. . We chose 2 items from the Appetizers section but I don't remember their names.... One had oxtail and bone marrow dumplings? It was really good, weird, but good.. And I chose a Baby Beet salad with this insanely delicious cheese on top. . . So far, dinner was great!!!. . We got the Porterhouse Steak for 2 as our main course with a side of cream spinach and mac and cheese. The steak was perfectly cooked. It came with all these different types of sauces so it made it fun to go through such a large piece of steak. . The spinach was.....ok. Not my favorite! But the hubby to be really enjoyed it. And the mac and cheese...... it is worth the extra few bucks. OMG.. . Overall the experience was great, I can see why everyone is so amazed by this chef and his restaurants. They did not miss one detail. Everything was perfect. . One thing I noticed that I absolutely loved, all the waiters serve the food at the exact same time. There was a table of 8 gentlemen next to us and when they got their food, 6 or 7 food runners rounded the table and once they were all set in place, they set the plates on the table simultaneously. I liked that.. . I'd like to go back some time. Maybe try the Beverly Hills location
3 words.... TO DIE FOR! What an amazing restaurant. The ambiance is classy, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the food was unbelievable. Coming from Los Angeles, our standards for steakhouses are very high and they met the challenge without a sweat. It was hard to decide what to eat because the entire menu was unique and interesting. For starters my husband had the Butter Lettuce salad with the most amazing champagne-herb vinaigrette we have ever had. I had a unique Beet salad with Humboldt fog goat cheese and the flavors blended perfectly. For our steaks it was hard to pick just one (which by the way, they do a tasting of 3 as well...which would be smart if you have never had wagyu before, totally worth it). He had the filet and I had the new york sirloin of their American Wagyu Beef from Snake River Farms Idaho. AMAZING!!! If you are a mushroom person, I would recommend adding this on your steak, the flavors were perfect. For dessert, he had the chocolate souffle and I had the cheese plate, both of which were a perfect ending to a perfect evening. . Thank you to the executive chef and the staff for a memorable last night in Vegas for us!
I actually visited CUT during January 2014 while in town for CES.  There is no question that CUT is a "good" steak house.  However after trying a few other steakhouses in Vegas (such as Gordon Ramsay), its definitely not the best.  . . I won't go into detail about all the sides (although the Mac and Cheese they have is AMAZING).  The issue I had was with the steak itself.  When I go to a steak house and order a steak, I am expecting to pay for a good piece of quality beef.  I want to "taste" the flavors of the meat.  Unfortunately, some restaurants feel the need to season (and possibly over-season) the meat.  This is where CUT falls short.  To me, they over-seasoned a great piece of beef so that all I could taste was the seasonings.  The actual meat flavor was eliminated.  It is a travesty to do this.  . . Overall, the restaurant is great.  Service was awesome.  Sides were good.  Atmosphere is good.  The steaks however left a lot to be desired.  . . Bottom line:  If you are going for the steak, there are better steakhouses available.
Best meal ever! From the service to the bread to the incredible cuts of meat, this was a meal to remember. Forget the price and get the New York Tasting Menu for $115 to same some amazing taste treats.
Surprisingly it wasn't busy when we get there on Saturday night although we got there at 10:30. What can I tell you, they do good steak. Side dishes portions were right and delicious.
CUT is an expensive steakhouse, you need to understand that going in.  Compared to other expensive steakhouses I've visited it was on par with the best.  Service and food quality were top notch (we perhaps waited a pinch longer for our mains than I would have liked though).  Would I return?  Probably not as there are too many other restaurants to visit in Vegas.  However, I do recommend it for a spendy but tasty steakhouse experience.
Very cool looking place.  Waiters dress like Cosmo bodyguards.  Our waiter was exceptional.  I found menu very confusing to my simplistic Texas palate.  I had no idea what a rocket was and several other weirdities to me.  Sophisticated foodies will love this place.  I was not crazy about the bone-in ribeye.  Polenta and cheese rolls were excellent.  We were seated next to ten loud drunk guys which made conversation at our table unbearable.
It was Sunday night. The last night of our three day binge of Vegas to celebrate my 30th birthday and the close of my "roaring twenties" decade.. . Where does one go for their last meal in Vegas let alone the last meal of their decade? . . Being the dedicated researcher that I am, I found that CUT by Wolfgang Puck had the reputation of being one of the best steak houses in Vegas, if not the country. I took a chance and booked this restaurant as the capstone of my trip and hopefully a delicious finish to the decade.. . And boy, did it not disappoint.. . When we arrived, my buddies and I were ushered by a young, pretty hostess to a VIP table with couch seating replete with accent pillows overlooking the entire restaurant; almost as if we were seated at the head table and the entire restaurant was attending our party. We opened a parsimonious menu that listed a total of approximately 18 entrees, all steaks, all aged between 21-35 days. One of my buddies ordered the Nebraska cattle 14 oz New York strip (aged 35 days). He was a big guy yet he was barely able to finish his meal.. . Now allow me to get to the most important part... The piece de resistance of their menu: authentic Wagyu beef imported from Japan's Miyazaki Prefecture. . . Our server presented our table raw Wagyu and "American Wagyu" (composed of a cross breed of Wagyu and American cattle) cuts of ribeye and New York strip to demonstrate the marbling of these impressive specimens of meat. An opportunity was presented for me to check off one of the loftiest items on my bucket list: a Wagyu steak dinner. The price of an 8 oz ribeye cut of one of the most sought-after steaks on the planet? A cool $155. . . Despite the high cost of this privilege, I couldn't turn down an opportunity to enjoy what would likely be one of the greatest meals of my life. Another buddy of mine took the plunge with me on this life-changing experience. We both ordered identical items: the 8 oz ribeye (medium rare), a side of seasoned french fries, and creamed spinach topped with a fried egg accompanied with a glass of Malbec. Solomon in all his riches never could have ordered a more decadent meal.. . 40 excruciating minutes later, our meal was at last presented to us. I sliced off my first piece and as I completed the first bite, it felt like the Heavens burst forth and angels were singing the Hallelujah chorus in rapturous praise. Fellow Yelpers, I was not eating a steak. Oh no. This was God speaking to us. Delighting in us. Cutting into the steak was like cutting into marbled butter from Heaven, with the meat dissolving in my mouth; absorbing into my very soul.. . ***. . T'was a meal that I will never forget. As we finished paying our bill, the manager of the restaurant came and thanked us for patronizing his restaurant though I'm sure it should've been us thanking him. A wonderful meal to cap off a wonderful decade. I'm not sure how many more decades the Good Lord has in store for me. However, if He should choose to allow me to choose my final meal on this Earth, I would like to travel back to this restaurant and enjoy one more time that which is truly a gift from on High.
2012, I travelled to Vegas to meet a darling old friend and he took me to CUT Steakhouse. Since then, I have compared every steakhouse to this location and no meat melts in my mouth as that night. The salad, appetizer, mashed potatoes and the STEAK was to die for.. I've been exposed to quality and now, I can't compare any other steakhouse to this place. My #1 Favorite Steakhouse of all time! Oh and service was spectacular unless my friend's presence as being a regular customer and a known face may have added to some favoritism. Either way, 5 stars was well deserved.
Ate here on 4/26 with a group. The food was very good however, I have had way better. I dont mind paying but this was not worth the price IMO. Was it good, yes, was it awesome, not really. I would have preferred Ruth Chris. . . I also thought the service was subpar. There were many instances where drinks were empty. Servers would take the empty glass then not offer another drink. Our party probably would have spent another couple hundred if the server asked us if we cared for another beverage.
Personally, I didn't like it. It's considered the number 2 steakhouse in Vegas. I ordered the ribeye and shared sides with our party creamed spinach, mushrooms and mac and cheese. Honestly, none of it was memorable. Felt that the steak was too heavy and lacking flavor. I didn't even finish an eighth of my steak. :(
Cut is definitely one of the top restaurants in Las Vegas. It's price is comparable to other steakhouses of that quality. I also went to Carnevino and thought Cut was far better in all aspects. The service was top notch, the steak and tuna tartar were both great as well as the bread and Macand cheese. I had the ribeye and my friend had the filet. I would definitely say go with the ribeye, can't beat the flavor.
