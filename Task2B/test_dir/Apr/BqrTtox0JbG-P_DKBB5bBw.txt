Well it was good. But I guess I should expect to pay close to $20 for a burger if I'm staying at the Cosmo. . . HAVE AN AMAZING selection of BEERS. BEER. BURRRR. Probably the best i've seen in LV so far. Anytime you have a wide selection of San Diego beers I am in LOVE!!!! SO kudos for that. Double Kudos for the SHAKES. Shake. SHHHHaaaWHAAAA.. . We sat in the lounge area because there isn't much of a wait compared to the table dining area. Our waitress wasn't very good though. She never really checked on us and took forever to give us our tab, but I rarely base my ratings on the service.. . ---FOOD---- and cocktail-----. . TIRAMISU / 11. Mascarpone Ice Cream, Ladyfinger Crumbs, Patron Xo Cafe Dark, Chocolate Syrup, Cocoa Powder, Espresso Beans. . Love how they give you a whole extra shake pretty much leftover, so it's definitely a shareable drink for sure! And enjoyed the little cookie garnish too ;0 why thank u!. . GOLD STANDARD* / 17.5. Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli. . The goat cheese and tomato confit made this burger worth the price! Well almost worth the price. I either was super hungry or a Holstein Heifer! I ate the whole thing! yup! Don't be fooled by my 113lb ass! Oh and I added avocado and a fried egg!!! yup! I did that!. . EL MACHETE* / 16. Beef Patty, Fire Roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Spicy 'Machete' Aioli. . My friend got this one which was spicy-deliciously just as tasty as mine. . . If I stay at the Cosmo---Or if you stay at he Cosmo pweeze check this place out. Get out of your room, don't bother ordering room service, walk your hungover ass over here, go straight to the bar and order a beer and look at their menu. WOrth it!
This was another place my brother insisted I come because our mom wanted to try the "Billion Dollar Burger" and so I took my parents here for lunch. It was pretty busy but I like the way that they would text you once your table is ready and the wait wasn't bad - less than 10 minutes. . . I ordered the Billion Dollar Burger for my mom- and what made it worth $32 was a thin slice of foie gras - that according to my mom made the burger super delicious and juicy...I guess it was a good combination and I was surprised my mom actually finished the whole burger. . . I had the Lobster Mac and Cheese - it was cheesy and definitely loaded with lots of lobster. The portion was small but was enough for me. And my dad ordered the Salmon burger but said it was too dry and didn't like it. The fries weren't good either  - it was pretty soggy and worse of all burnt. There isn't really anything on the menu that is under 10 dollars - except of the sides and shakes. . . The service was okay. Overall I think it's okay - but I should have tried a burger and shake to make better judgement of the food they are known for - which are burgers - not mac and cheese. so for now it's okay...until next time.
Swanky burger place.  There were people of all ages here from middle aged adults having a good time to kids barely 21.  We came with a group of 7 and was seated in around 20 minutes which was a lot faster than the 45min they quoted us.  . . The waitstaff was very friendly and they are on top of their game with the drink refills.  No one really seemed to have a standard burger they all liked except the Nom Nom which I didn't try.  I split 2 burgers.. . Good:. Gold standard - Added an egg to this burger and thought this burger was good.  There wasn't anything super fancy about it but just straight forward deliciousness.. sweet potato fries. . Just ok:. onion rings - hot, cripsy but oversalted.. . Didn't like:. The rising sun - didn't like the oil soaked tempura avacado and the glaze was over powering. fries - Were almost all soggy but still managed to be dry.  I dont know how thats possible.
I have been here several times and I really enjoy the milk shakes here and the ambiance...I tried the lobster roll and also the burgers...they were good but not as good as other reviews led me to believe. They have good french fries, the pot stickers were delicious, as were the cuban street tacos.
#vakseen4taste At this point Holsteins has become one of those spots we hit anytime we're in Vegas. They have a great beer, cocktail and food selection. Last night we started with the truffled lobster mac n cheese. I've actually been dying to try this dish and it was pretty good. Not great, but good. I'd say it was more the seasoning (or lack of) and flavor of the actual cheese sauce used that could've been better. I expected something a little more rich and creamy. The best thing about this dish is that they didn't go light on the lobster. You had chunks in almost every bite. From there I had the Captain hook (Grilled atlantic salmon w/ frissee, pickled shallots, herb-caper mayo & house cured gravlax) which was excellent. I ordered the salmon medium and it came out a little closer to medium welll, yet it was still flaky and amazing. The combination of flavors in this sandwich are crazy! The house cured gravlax...WOW. Service was pretty quick considering the Final 4 was on and the place was packed. I'd actually recommend making reservations before coming because this place is always packed. Before I forget, our server was very friendly and barely clothed lol. I mean literally her ass was hanging out of her shorts, a LA Hooters. No complaints on my end, but the ladies found it pretty entertaining lol. Just a tip if you bring the jealous type. All in all, a great experience as expected. Food 8.5/10. Service 8/10. Atmosphere 8/10
These guys really know how to do a burger. Nice and juicy and the burger was the perfect size amount for one person. Comes with some fries too.. . And you must get some of their alcohol based shakes too. It's like the perfect dessert to compliment your burger. I got the chocolate smores shake and that was very rich. They make extras so you get a cup and a half and that is a lot already, coupled that with the burger, you are definitely putting in about 2000 calories for a visit.. . And the 2000+ calories is worth it coming here. Your taste buds will appreciate you a lot. And their selection of beers on tap are very impressive as well.
Good burgers. But just good. Not anything special. The price was too high for the burger. The shake was overly sweet. The fries were okay. The service was pushy. They really try to upsell you. Yeah I know, how do you upsell in a burger joint? Stop by and they will show you. Decor is fun though. I don't think I'll be coming back with all the other options on the strip.
This was my go to burger spot before GR Burgr opened up. Holsteins is certainly not cheap, and you can definitely make some catastrophic decisions given their large menu- so here is some guidance on what you should get. . Bam Boozled Shakes- Not a huge fan of booze-cream but some of these are pretty spectacular. . Birthday cake- yea it pretty much tastes like a birthday cake . . Cereal bowl- captain crunch FTW. . Black Cow- even comes with pop rocks on top. . . Not great. Drunken monkey- sounds great in theory, but in practice is pretty awful. . Creme Brule- custard and booze do not mix . . Red Velvet- bleh. . . Big Buns. . Meat ball burger- some purists would probably not like this but it is delicious- it has a tasty focacia bun and pesto on it. . Gold Standard- Bacon, Goat cheese, Garlic aoli- this is definitely not for the faint of heart- but those man enough to stare death from heart disease in the face will be rewarded with sensuous delights. . . Rising Sun- tempura avocado. Thats fried avacado. If you aren't already ordering this burger as we speak I don't know what else to say to you.. . . What to Avoid. Nom Nom- this is pretty meh. Kobe beef should be so good it stands on its own (you are paying enough for that anyway)- but here it is covered in potato chips and 1000 island dressing- a dissapointment. . California Turkey- if you are trying to eat healthy this probably isn't the place for you but even the veggie burger is better than this
We came here because the line for Secret Pizza was too long. But I very much regret coming here. I was looking for something small so I looked at their "Mini Buns" section. I ended up getting the Lobster Roll. It came with two small rolls but the bread was cut so shallow that there was barely any fillings. Plus I didn't like the taste of it. It was $16.50 which is way too expensive for how small/not tasty it is. My friend ordered a Caesar salad with grilled chicken. The salad was $12, the chicken was $8. $8 for a small piece of grilled chicken?! Are you crazy?!. . I'm never coming back here again.
Food: A bit overpriced even for gourmet burgers. I had one of their most expensive burgers, the appropriately named Billionaire Burger. One of the ingredients was foie gras which made it taste really good. The burger came with a small bucket of fries. I had an Old Rasputin to go with the burger. I would come back to try some of the other burgers on the menu.. . Service: I sat at the bar and the bartender provided excellent service. If it were based on service alone, this place would get 5 stars. But keep in mind that I got there right when they opened for lunch. Everybody was still fresh. :). . Location: Inside the Cosmopolitan on the 2nd floor. It's very easy to locate with signs everywhere. You can't miss it!
Holsteins or Gordon Ramsay BurGR. Although close, I still vote for BurGR simply because Holsteins is a good $5 more expensive per burger with comparable quality in my opinion. My friend begs to differ but this is my review.. . Drinks here are overpriced and very average, so I wouldn't recommend spending your money on them.. . Burgers range from like $18-20 on average, and it's a very average sized patty, maybe 1/3lb. They are cooked well though, as you would expect. . . As everyone says, I tried the Gold Standard burger with an egg and I finished that in like 2 minutes.. . One thing for this place is that the place is pretty big and the we didn't have to wait very long, compared to a 30-45min wait at BurGR. Either way, I'd suggest coming here to try it if you haven't, since it's a decent place. As for me, I'd come back here only if I'm destroying the tables at Cosmo or literally have no time to eat elsewhere, otherwise I'd probably go to the Cosmo Buffet instead.
SO Good.  We got into Vegas late and wanted a place where we could take our kids for a fun and tasty dinner.  The wait was only about 30 minutes at 8 pm for party of 5.  It was ok to have kids and the food was really good.  We did have to wait a long time for our food and our waitress to check back in with us.  But, it seems when in Vegas the service is not that great anywhere as so much of their customers are one time travelers.  It also helps that it is located inside the Cosmopolitan which is the greatest hotel on the strip too!
Before leaving Vegas, I was determined to try Holsteins. It's very hard to get a decent burger out in Surprise, AZ and as a burger    connoisseur I felt it was my mission to taste and to yelp. So I did. And it was spectacular.. . Holsteins is located inside the Cosmopolitan and easy to get to. We were seated within 20 minutes and served almost immediately.. . I didn't try their bamBOOZLE shakes (although I plan to next time) but a friend got their regular shake and it was great. . . Each one of us got a different burger and were def not keen on sharing as it was tooooo good to not eat the whole thing. I got the Gold Standard burger with reg fries. It was cooked to a perfect medium and so juicy (that my mouth is watering as I type). The goat cheese and arugula really made it a tasty burger.. . My beau got the Nom Nom burger. I'll never forget the way his face lit up when he took that first bite. He said it's one of the best burgers he's ever had. As a fellow burger connoisseur, he must mean business. It was cooked a little well for his taste but man that Kobe beef is bomb diggity. I highly recommend subbing your side for onion rings. I found myself sneaking a few fried rings whenever he was in the midst of mouth-gasm. . . The burgers + drinks were a bit pricey but well worth it for the quality of the meal. This is def the best burger joint in Vegas. Holla!
Great burger  top notch
Always great service and amazing food!! The shakes are super yummy and the hamburgers don't disappoint!!
To say that Holstein's is incredible is an understatement. . . I have had a few burgers from Holstein's, and each burger is beyond phenomenal. This is one of the few restaurants that offer a gluten free bun, let alone a gluten free bun that is delicious, so when I found out they had this option we immediately ran to this restaurant without passing go. Add on the fact they have spiked milkshakes, and I am all set to go.. . The three burgers I've had at Holstein's are:. . Burger of the Day: Short Rib Burger. This burger had huge chunks of melt in your mouth short rib that made everything seem right in the world.. . Gold Standard Burger: Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli . . This burger should be the first burger you eat at Holstein's. Everything about it is right. You'd think a burger with that many ingredients would be overwhelming, but it's not. No wonder this burger has gotten them several well-earned awards. Everyone we know that has come to Holstein's with us has loved this burger.. . Captain Hook Burger:. Grilled Atlantic Salmon w/Frissee, Pickled Shallots, Herb-Caper Mayo & House Cured Gravlax . . To be quite honest, I don't know what Gravlax is, but whatever it is I love it and will go back to Holstein's to eat it whenever my waistline can bear it. The salmon was cooked perfectly: tender in the inside with a buttery crust on the outside and definitely not greasy. If you're looking for a lighter option instead f a burger, this is the way to go.. . Go here. You will love every bite. If you have a gluten allergy or not, you will be able to eat their regular french fries (natural cut and good, but nothing life altering) or their sweet potato fries which are a delicious treat in a world that rarely gets sweet potato fries right. If you're looking for less fried, go with the coleslaw. So, so good. Eat up and enjoy!
The food is great here! They have absolutely amazing burgers, wonderfully inventive appetizers and the shakes are a must! A special note if you're a vegetarian they can make any of the burgers on the menu with a veggie patty.
High price for  burgers you can get pretty much anywhere in Vegas for cheaper.  There was a server switch after we put in our order and ended up not getting the appetizer we ordered and they didn't not even offer to comp anything for us.  The burger was ok nothing I have not had before.
Worst service ever...I stopped in for a quick bite before I hit the aria casino ....the food was expensive and really not that great...I've been in the restaurant business for many years and I was shocked to have to pay 14 bucks for three burger sliders that came without fries ....when the plate came the burgers were the size of a silver dollar....ridiculous ....jus because your on the strip doesn't mean you sacrifice quality .... Seriously people!. . Then to top it off the waitress didn't bring me the free popcorn ....and sitting there seeing 6 tables around me get popcorn ...gave me the feeling of not being welcomed .... :(
Average.. . Salad was good - fresh & crisp.. . Burger was okay. I got the memphis, the bbq portion was good the burger was semi-dry (ordered medium, was closer to medium-well) but the bun held up alright. Their boozy shakes looked awesome, but I didnt order any (the burger filled me up easily) so I can't comment.
Hellllllllooooooooooooo burgers! . . I want so badly to give them higher than a three star because my burger was delicious and I loved by strawberry milkshake but the service here was not so fantastic.. . We got seated quickly in the back and each got a water while we ordered drinks and looked at the menu.  The server seemed to disappear for about 15 minutes and our milkshakes took forever to come.  Let me just preface that it was absolutely not busy/packed by any means so I'm not sure what was going on.  We ended up ordered, got our shakes (which were delicious by the way) and got our burgers a bit after. The BF had the onion rings and I had fries (which were cold and I had to ask for a fresh order because they were definitely stale). . . We didn't have a lengthy meal (it was lunch time) and I didn't think we were being annoying by any means with what we ordered, refills, etc.  but it felt like we had quite a long lunch . . The burgers themselves were quite good but with the time, service and price tag for it all, I'd say that it's just "OK".  . . $66 before tip for 2 burgers, 2 shakes, onion rings and fries.
Pork belly was delicious! A little too saucy but meat itself was crispy and juicy! Truffle lobster Mac was really good too! Came here with my 8 year old and scene was definitely kids friendly! Order three small app dishes and it was the perfect amount for the two of is including a virgin Oreo milkshake!
First good service I've had at any of the cosmopolitan bars or restaurants. The burgers were unique and very moist and tasty. The only thing that could be improved was the frys.
I only had a salad and sweet potato fries so I cannot speak to the burger quality. Everyone else seemed to quite enjoy their burgers and shakes though!. . I had a spring salad that was decent quality and a good mix of greens with some pecans and pomegranate seeds. Service was good and they provide a tiny bucket of cheesy popcorn to munch on as well.
Nun sind wir schon eine Weile aus Vegas zuruck und nun werde ich mal das kulinarische bewerten. . Wer milchshakes mag ein absolutes muss. Was war der lecker. Jam jam. . Die Bedienungen wie eigentlich uberall freundlich. Man wird zu seinem Tisch gefuhrt. . Wir bekamen einen eimer voll mit gesalzenen Popcorn vom Hause. . Mein burger hat mir jetzt nicht so geschmeckt aber der Rest war zufrieden. . Alleine aber fur den milchshake hat es sich gelohnt.
It was good.  I'm not going to spend too much time reviewing as my sentiments have been expressed over and over in these reviews.. . Great burger for an exuberant price.  I had the Rising Sun which is probably the most unique burgeron the menu with tempura fried avocado slices, a "teriyaki" which was more of a Korean bulgogi type of sauce, crispy onions and a fried egg which I added manually.  Great burger, but nothing that blew my pants off.. . I sat at the bar and the bartender was on top of things.  She was very attentive and always had my drink refilled.  This was an off hour however and I was like one of maybe 15 people in the restaurant.. . . I still prefer Burger Bar to all of the other burger joints on the strip.
Great burgers! A bit on the pricey side. I had the greek lamb burger and it was awesome. I'd say it's a must try while you're at the Cosmopolitan. If a sports game is on while you're there expect some noisy fans.
Las vegas. BURGERS! Adult Milkshakes!  That's a trifecta in my book. This place is def a stop you should include in your vegas experience. They have fun art on the walls, friendly service and amazing food. I got the rising sun kobe beef burger and wow, so delicious. It had tempura avocado with this teriyaki glaze making it a truly original burger. . . Milkshakes are my favorite. So when going to a place the specializes in milkshakes, let alone 'adult' milkshakes I get truly stoked. This place came through on a glorious milkshake. I got the red velvet milkshake and it came in a big glass, as well as the extra metal cup pretty much meaning you got two milkshakes. . . The calamari was bomb too!
There's so much on the menu and so many things I wanted to try. I ended up just getting a simple burger. The fries were too salty for me so I couldn't eat them all and I LOVE fries. Free margarita with check in!
Meatball burger and sweet potato fries were awesome. Had the berry fresh cocktail, delicious but not something I could not have gotten somewhere else.. . Wife loved the chicken cheese buffalo dip.. . Service was prompt and pleasant.
