Why is this airport great? The view! You literally fly over the strip, getting a great view of the huge hotels & casinos (especially at night). . . I love coming into this airport, you take a quick tram to the main terminal and are immediately surrounded by great places to eat and drink. Everything is clean and shiny.. the huge welcome to vegas sign is really nice (Check out my photo) . The baggage claiming is surprisingly good due to its HUGE size (larger than the one in New York City) and works like a charm.. . What sucks?. - No free recharging! The wall sockets are limited to those that are "pay per charge" and are very expensive.. - Very limited selection of shops pre-checkin and NONE that are open at night. . - It gets insanely cold at night.. the cold air blows into the building itself and really really chills down the pre-checkin area!. - The rental car area is offsite, you need to catch a bus to another building. IMPORTANT: Not all rental companies are open 24/7! The last two rental cars were from Sixt & Fox and both are offsite.. Sixt is only 400m away, but closes at 24:00! . . I once spent a night on this airport due to a delayed flight and I had to starve and freeze! Seriously, it gets so cold in this place that you start shivering, there are no lounge seats or anything comfortable for that matter. Which leads to everyone sleeping on the floor! Now I'm the last guy that starts moaning about, I've slept in pretty crappy places before..but this place is seriously the WORST airport when it comes to spending the night... if I ever have the same situation, I'd rent a hotel room (even for a few hours).. . Why only 3 stars? Minus ONE for the lack of shops pre-checkin. And Minus the second for the crappy rental car area. The airport itself is great.. and I'd give them 5 stars straight away if they changed those things.
Pros: It's an airport, people need to use them. Cons: Everything else. I changed planes in Terminal 3 and was surprised by how dirty the entire area was. There were little pieces of paper and bits of food on every square foot of the carpeting. The restroom looked like it had cooties. There was an attendant  "cleaning", she did not wipe the standing water off the sinks and the floors appeared to never have been mopped.  Three of the six water faucets did not work.. Am not sure what the attendant was doing, maybe just pushing the trash can around. Other attendants in the main areas were clustered around talking. Yea, I know it is dirty work, but the alternative is the filthy airport they run there.  . An employee told me "it's all about the slot machines". So if you want to play slots on a layover in a dirty environment, go for it. I will be using another aiport for layovers in the future.
Ah the Las Vegas airport.  It is where you see people hopeful and full of excitement as they arrive and see people departing, hungover, sad and desperate as they pump their remaining quarters into the airport slot machines.  . . Aside from the desperation that flows from the airport, Terminal 1 itself feels crowded.  I feel like the areas where people walk are much more narrow than other airports and the food options were less than impressive.  A $10 Burger King Whopper Meal is something I would normally avoid at all costs, but was forced into with little options near my gate.    . . Terminal 3 however, was a different experience.  There was wide open spaces and there was a decent restaurant where I had a good burger with an IPA as I awaited my flight on Virgin.  It felt much more modern and less on the desperation scale.  If only the entire airport could be like that.
Big airport with long taxis into your gate if you're unlucky (which I was).  Surly TSA folks who don't like the human phlegm cavorting through their airport.  That's the bad.  The good?  People watching equals a 10+ for sure!  Warmer than Cincinnati in the winter (that was easy).  Fun to fly in at night as you can see Vegas' lights screaming at you in the middle of all that blackness from at least 100 miles out, and that's a once in a lifetime experience (or is it?)  . . So very many droopy heads inside this airport though!  Looks like a lot of you flyers have a case of the Mondays!  Extraordinary numbers and degrees of those pesky hangovers are apparent at this airport.  Side note: I've never seen so many women, young and old, go through an airport in velvet pajama bottoms.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, just a Vegas anomaly I suppose..... . Why in the name of God would I give Las Vegas International McCarron Airport 4 stars? Slot machines everywhere, at every terminal food court and even randomly placed in otherwise nondescript terminal walkways!  Screw USA Today and a Starbucks latte at 515 AM, let's hit some more slots, people!
This airport, unlike any other, is all about getting zero sleep before you zombie walk in to the place, to your gate, and on to your plane. Being fully rested makes the security buzzer go off and is highly not recommended.
Is it weird to use the words "sexy" and "beautiful" to describe an airport terminal??. . The newly constructed/renovated terminal #3 at McCarran is modern, well laid out, has plenty of seating, clean bathrooms, charging stations, wifi, new restaurants and stores, huge windows, tons of natural light, a spacious layout, and a quick TSA check point!. . Believe it or not, everything I've just told you is true.. . One of the best airports I've passed through in the entire world. . . And no, all you first timers to Vegas/McCarran, there are NO slot machines in the bathrooms. Not sure who started that rumor hahaha!. (There are slot machines just about everywhere else you look though)
Busy airport. . . Nothing special. . . Same check in procedure. . . Slot machines are present. . . Peaceful.
This is the best airport ever. So convenient and easy to access everything. I love how when you walk off the plane, the first thing you see are slot machines.  Makes you remember that you are really in Vegas and not some knock off place.
"Remember what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Except for herpes. That s**t'll come back with you." -- The Hangover (2009). . Well, what can you say about an airport really? This one is relatively easy to get around in - signage is easy to follow, baggage carousels are laid out well and spread out so there is not an issue getting your things and getting to a taxi, shuttle, limo, whatnot.  And obviously, slot machines galore!. . So here is the issue - the taxi stand line is INSANE.  Now, it moves relatively well - well managed, lots of slots for people to get cabs - but the snaking line it 6 rows deep! It was filled to the max when I visited recently since it was NASCAR weekend. It only ended up taking 15 minutes or so for it to be my turn.  Not too bad.. . Leaving the airport was super simple - the cab dropped us off and the Delta counter was easy to find and check in. Their directions to security (and a post office/mail box) were spot on.  Security went very fast and walking to the terminal and to the gate was probably the most painless of most airports (especially not being my home airport) ever.  Again, more slot machines.. . Plenty of places to buy water and snacks for the ride home as well as a Starbucks.  Easy pisy.
This airport needs a makeover. Chairs are uncomfortable, it's hot, and outlets are far too few and far between. . . One nice thing, though, is the TSA Pre Check lanes. At least I can breeze through security here!
Nice amenities, always quick through security just arrive a little early. Plenty of places to eat and drink while you wait, the shuttle system for rent cars is excellent.
Vegas baby!!  Terminal 3 is nice, modern, lots of shops and restaurants and best of all, there are lots of exits where you can quickly dash out of and catch a cab to your hotel on the Strip!  Quick in and out.  I also like the standing charging stations.  Just ignore any rude security people, they are all annoying anyway.
I fly Jet Blue usually and it's always effortless. Nice food choices in Jet Blue terminal compared to other parts of this airport. Southwest terminal has the same horrible choices you see everywhere else: non-food like Burger King and McD's. Nothing for vegetarians or people who would like to live to be 70.. . Bathrooms were clean and it looked like they're serviced often. Soap in the ladies room was not as abrasive as other airports.. . Lots of slots if that's your jam. All in all, meh. Fly JetBlue to get the nice terminal.
The main airport in Las Vegas. This airport isn't really hard to find as it is just off the strip and daily close by. We made it there in less than 15 minutes from Paris.. . The one problem with this airport is, unlike JFK or LAX, you have no idea where you're going. When you pull in, ur directed into either terminal 1 or terminal 3. Most of the main flight usually arrive to terminal 1 but I would check because quite a few do arrive to the 3. Once you get to the proper terminal, it gets divided into short term, long term, and pick up. Pick up is manned so no way you'll get to hang out until whoever you're picking up comes out. They'll brush u off in a second. Easiest way to pick up someone is to go to the short term parking. Rates are not too bad. $2 per hour. Take your ticket with u to pay when you leave. Once inside, it's also confusing as you have to find the flight arriving by destination it left from, then find the proper terminal for the company. Which again isn't lined up by name or anything but by a letter and a number that you have to go find. . . We got to the terminal and the furthest u can go is TSA and their metal detector.. . Overall, this place just deserves a 3 stars in my opinion. Would be better organized and easier for people to find where they are going if it was indicated where each airplane company arrives to and where we should park for it. Anyway, I got someone to go pick up. Happy flying!
Wanna see something really ugly?  Imagine hundreds and hundreds of people playing slots.  Most of them are in some stage of alcohol poisoning.  They're waiting for a flight and desperate to spend every last dime they have before they leave.  AND NOW THE POWER FAILS!  Trust me, it's really ugly.. . If you removed all the slot machines, it's just another A-OK airport. The signage is fine.  WiFi is decent. The power outlets are plentiful. The food, shops, etc. are typical. It gets the job done.  Fly in, fly out, and move on.
I gave the airport one star not because it's ugly or that it's difficult to catch a cab or get your luggage.  I gave it one star because the TSA agent was SO incredibly arrogant and nasty to all the passengers trying to get through the security checkpoint.  . . While I understand it must be difficult maintaining order while thousands of people get through security everyday, I do NOT think it's necessary to be an A$$HOLE to everyone and go on with your diatribe (repeated every time he's done) VERY loudly and very demeaning (I'm sure this isn't in the employee handbook because I've been through MANY airports and I've never encountered this before...EVER).  Publicly shaming passengers for missteps (again...VERY loud and trying to embarrass passengers).  One person (not me) left their shoes on the belt and didn't push them in and he CALLED THEM OUT on it and then harrassed them in front of several hundred people.  Seriously?  No one should be allowed to behave that way.  . . I WANTED to say something to the guy but you know that they would have pulled me out of line and made me miss my flight.  . . I really hope that someone reads this and notifies his supervisor and he gets FIRED.  This is one of those situations that someone gets a bit of authority over others and takes it to the extreme.  I'm pretty disgusted with the morning and I really hope that Karma bites this guy in the rear because after what I witnessed this morning around 830 am, he has it coming to him.
We got our bags WAY fast when we landed initially and the people seemed much nicer here than in any other airport I've been in.... . . When we were leaving, it was quick to check-in, security was fast and efficient and there were a few places to grab a bite to eat.  . . I couldn't charge my poor 7% battery phone because the iPhone charger does not fit in the outlet... *it's too small and wiggles out*. . Besides that, the airport is fine.  The only larger chains for food are Moe's and Burger King.  We settled for the philly cheesesteak place in the B terminal.... wasn't too bad.
Spring Break coming to an end. Nice airport. You don't have to take off your freakin shoes or your laptop going thru TSA and they are so efficient too.
Try the mr. Lucky's slot machine in the D terminal. It's my favorite slot machine. Its also my favorite airport because its in my favorite city.. LAS VEGAS! . . Plenty of eating choices to choose from, lots of good people watching and plenty of places to rest your head if you are catching a flight on zero sleep (Been there, done that!)
It's an airport. Definitely not one of the best I've been to. Kind of dated, has the usual overpriced shops, long security lines, etc. There are slot machines everywhere you go. They do have free wifi, a good redeeming factor. . I'm allergic to this airport, though. No, seriously; something in this airport makes my eyes run. Happened when I arrived here and as soon as I returned for my departure.
Love this little airport very easy to fly in and out. Even the TSA is super friendly here. We have never encountered a checkin time of more than 30 mins from getting in and clearing security check. . . Facilities are clean and ample of space to chill out before the flight. . . The pros: short checkin times at airline and security check. Tons of place to be comfortable before boarding. . Clean facilities . Quick access to baggage claims. Friendly TSA agents . Only 2 terminals so much easier to get around . . The cons: not much selection in terms of food so plan on brining something along. Not a hub so if you miss a flight you will have tough time getting another one. . . Cool city cool airport!!
Hey, they built a new terminal!  And it's missing outlets for charging like the others.. . Had a long layover in Vegas.  After a long walk, I sat myself in their new terminal, which is nice.  There are some good eating options and sales kiosks.  And the people watching is a slot above in Vegas-- so many tattoos, piercings, people on all ends of the emotional spectrum, and passengers running around to watch.. . Knocks are all the gambling machines, a design flaw in too few outlets to charge your devices, and a sprawling layout.. . Okay overall and improving over time...
This is a perfectly acceptable small airport. Sure, the slot machines are annoying, but hey, you're in Vegas. I had no issues getting in or out of here, and the line for security was very well-organized and fast. I found it navigable both in terms of arriving and departing. But, I took a cab both ways, so maybe it's different when you're driving.. . The food in the Jet Blue terminal was typical airport fare. Overpriced, mall food court quality food. I did get a nice cup of tea at the cafe, and the folks working there were super nice. The line was slow as hell though. If you want anything better than a fast food burger and fries, you're gonna have to lower your expectations or eat before you leave for the airport. . . What I really liked was that there were plenty of outlets to charge your electronics, and ample seating. Some airports are so stingy with the electricity, or place them in the middle of nowhere so you have to sit on the floor with your device while it charges, like a desperate animal. Not so at McCarran. Charge 'em up while you sit in a chair with dignity!
The majority of my travel is for work so when I'm at an airport I look for certain things:. . Quiet spaces to work - this more or less does not exist at LAS thanks to the loud slot machines all over every terminal. . . Areas to charge my laptop/phone - if you want to stand in a cramped hallway right outside the bathrooms I suppose this can happen. . . Plenty of seating space for passengers - LAS has packed terminals flooded with passengers in various stages of drunkenness. Good people watching (shout out to the lady flying in her bikini) but also annoying (shout out to all the drunken bachelorette parties). . . Great restaurants for long layovers - I guess if a martini counts as dinner this is OK. . . LAS more or less fails for my needs, but it's not the worst airport I've ever been in. . . #BeAwesome ~ chase
Flying in and out of Las Vegas' airport isn't super fun anyway as most travelers are most likely to be hungover and/or sleep deprived and therefore not in the best of moods.. . Though pretty easy to navigate with their signage showing where to find the cabs and which terminal is where, their security checkpoint is horrible. There was one long, slow moving line to get through security with one x ray machine open for carry ons and passengers for Gates A through C. It was fairly busy, as I'd assume Las Vegas is pretty much all the time but this airport did not have the people to accommodate that. Numerous people in front of me were late and/or running to their airplane. I was a runner and made it just in time.. . My advice, you plan on flying out of this airport, come earlier than you normally would.
During a recent Vegas trip I flew into and then out of McCarran Airport.. . McCarran was a little less friendly than San Jose. Less places to eat, more slots, more gift shops, more people looking exhausted instead of perky and tech-conscious.. . The TSA was a little more involved as well and I'm fairly sure I qualified for pre-screen and they simply didn't let me know which line to go into. The TSA was friendly, but it's still a little bit of a downer to be body searched and step into a large machine.. . Parking was easy and though their elevator is quite difficult to figure out I had no baggage so for me the process was, while not as quick as San Jose, still fairly speedy.. . I wouldn't mind flying back to and from McCarran, but it's definitely not as cush as SJ.
Depending on your point of view, there is nothing more (1) entertaining or (2) miserable than McCarran on an early Sunday morning. Whether you choose 1 or 2 depends on how much you've had to drink the night before.. . The obligatory slot machines remind you that you are in Vegas. Wi-fi is free and the signal is decent, they sell a LOT of Gatorade, coffee and coconut water, and the power outlet situation is hit or miss. . . There tend to be more people crawled up in little balls on the ground, though. And lots more people wear sunglasses indoors. Oh, Vegas.
