A bit disappointed in my meal. Wife had the shrimp tamale, enjoyed it. I had the veal chop and ordered a plantain tamale instead of goat cheese tamale.. . Veal chop was ok but at $48 not amazing enough. I couldn't eat the plantain tamale, it was starch + starch + sugar = blech, and I love both tamales and plantains.. . Brussels sprouts were in syrup, would have much preferred a crisper sautee with bacon. Also didn't finish those.. . Blue corn duck pancake was tasty. Spicy pork was also quite tasty. Our waiter recommended a sweet Riesling to match our meals, it worked for my father-in-law's pork but was odd with my veal.. . Ordered the cactus margarita, fine but not outstanding.
We ate here a few times in last few years. Just now catching up with all my review. Not my favorite place to eat. My daughter loves it so I have been here few times. I have to be honest I hate cilantro so that explains my love/hate relationship I have with Mexican food. If I can find something without cilantro I am good unfortunately here I think they sneak it in a lot. I would  always get the ancho chile chicken (which I see is no longer on the menu) but it was always just ok. Daughter loved the tamales which she actually made at home following his recipe but still not a fan. Service was iffy some good some just bad.
Great place!!. . We came here with a group of 7 for dinner around 9:00pm on a Tuesday. Our server and all the other servers were very attentive. Our server had very good knowledge withthe menu and was helpful and willing to answer any questions. . . I got the scallops and they were delicious!! They had a delicious sauce with them and were cooked perfectly. Everyone's plates came out in a timely manner, and they were all played beautifully. The queso fundido was also very good that we got as an appetizer! . . I would definitely be back and want to try different things on the menu! :)
Update.  Have been back 2-3 times since our first visit and Mesa Grill has more than made up for the things that were lacking during our initial experience!  It's a must stop for at least a cocktail every time we are in Vegas!
Came here for my friend's birthday on April 3rd and left not satisfied. Our group was only a four top and being that we are all in the industry we are extremely flexible. We had an hour to eat and we immediately let the server know that we did not mind if the meal was not coursed out. We ordered the chicken quesadillas and tiger shrimp tamale to start. One of our guests is unable to eat cilantro and we asked if the kitchen could omit the cilantro and she immediately said no, that it was their signature dish. I understand if a first wants to add something to a signature dish they would alter the flavor however just omitting cilantro shouldn't have been a problem. So our guest could not have one of the appetizers. . . The same guest then ordered the chicken and asked if that could be done without cilantro. The server said okay, however when it came out it was covered in it and she could not eat her dish. The rest of the party that did not have cilantro in their dishes offered to trade, so we got through it. . . My lamb chops were ordered medium and came out rare to medium rare in parts. Same for two of the steaks the were ordered medium rare came out either extremely rare or well done in parts. I know that we  rushed our meal but this still does not explain the overall preparation of our meal and how short it fell.. . Definitely not the best celebration experience for the money. Would've been better off at stacked which I went for my two year anniversary and was extremely wowed. . . Service: horrible. Food: good, not amazing. Chance of returning: not likely
Had lunch here last Saturday afternoon and the 4 stars are just for the food because the service was terrible...well at least our server was absolutely unattentive and almost completely silent except when he absolutely had to speak to take our order and then it was like pulling teeth...we actually had to ask if we could have a moment of his time to order dessert.  The guest at the table next to us took notice and mentioned it to her server who (to her credit) proceeded to try and make up for the lack of customer service from our own server... That being said, we had the sweet potato soup, shrimp tamale, new mexico chili rubbed pork sandwich, deep dish banana cream pie, and toasted coconut cake. All the food was delicious and prepared perfectly.
I wasn't impressed.  Being an "iron chef" and always watching hes shows I guess my expectations we're to high. To me the service was slow and the food was mediocre nothing very memorable. I don't think I would go back.  Im going to try hes new burger restaurant in hopes that I have a better experience.
This is one of my fav places.  Food is amazing.  Love that the menu changes and has different types of game meats.  Definitely should make reservations!!
Since I am one of the 50% of the population that hate cilantro (see "I Hate Cilantro.com), our waiter said the only thing the kitchen could offer was a burger!  Come on, Chef Flay, you're kidding, right?  Everything was already pre-made with the nasty green herb.  Such a disappointment for lunch, will never return.
The food here is phenomenal. Even the bread basket we started with was delicious, made up of a fresh cornmuffin, a sweet bread with raisins baked inside, and another bread with jalepeno pieces baked in giving it a tiny bite. Dined here with my hubby during our Vegas weddingmoon and we were very pleased. The lobster tacos are fresh and yummy as a starter, comes w/ 3 bite size tacos. The tiger shrimp appetizer is a must. The creamy corn sauce with fresh cilantro goes so well with the shrimp. For an entree I got the pork tenderloin, something I typically wouldn't order but it was highly recommended by a frequent diner. It was the perfect portion size for me. The meat was tender and delicious, complimented by flavors of black pepper and some slightly spicy orange sauce that was awesome. Also got a side of the queso mashed potatoes sprinkled with fresh herbs (maybe chives?)...very creamy and delicious. Only complaint is that I ordered a mixed drink that tasted as if it was made with cheap, bad alcohol. If I'm paying an arm and a leg to wine & dine in Sin City, it's pretty disappointing to be served a poor quality cocktail.
I came here with a friend who convinced me that this was one of the best restaurants that he had eaten at and that we had to go here for a second dinner!. . We jumped in a cab and headed over here to Caesers  from Hard Rock.  We did not have a reservation and the 25 mt wait was not too bad. Not like there is nothing to do or see here. . . The decor was nice, not too loud like most other Vegas establishments. The brussels sprout salad was great. The pork chop was amazing and the churro for dessert was the piece de resistance. . . It was well worth it. It was a very good meal and Mr Bobby Flay has another winner here.
Not a bad brunch. The cactus pear iced tea was tasty and quite refreshing. The goat cheese queso fundido was amazing! My wife can't take a lot of spice, so we got the blistered Serrano vinaigrette on the side, which proved to be a wise call, though it was tasty. . . The main dishes just weren't quite as successful, though. My wife got the scrambled eggs chilaqules which were supposed to have a tomatillo sauce. I make my own tomatillo sauce all the time, and this wasn't one. It was made from hatch chilies or something similar. She didn't really enjoy it. . . I got the green chile cheeseburger and wasn't terribly impressed. It was just too heavy and was in desperate need of acid or something to brighten it up. The fries, however, were delicious and well seasoned. . . I'm sure some other main dishes might be more successful, but the apps, teas, and fries were world class.
Excellent food. Good service, no hats allowed. Idk why that is a rule, but it's cool. The 4 things ordered to my table: NY Strip, Salmon, Top Sirloin and some kind of chicken breast my boring ass dad ordered. I had the steak, you can't cook it much better, and the twice baked potato will make you squirm in your seat with pleasure. Haha. Ok the salmon.....idk exactly how they do it, but this salmon was just perfect. The complimentary pre meal bread was lame, other than that...yeah....no complaints, worth it. Eat here. Sneak into the back and slap Bobby on the butt for the nice little spot he's got there. (He's not there)
Absolutely fabulous!. You cannot go wrong with any Mesa Grill!. Our table had seafood, steak, lamb, and pork, everything was perfect.. Great service, great atmosphere and great food!
Mesa Grill is quite simply superb.. . I have been wanting to try Bobby Flay's food for quite some time.  I was not disappointed.... . I ate at the bar - the bar staff enjoyed helping me pick cocktails and my meal as well as making great suggestions.  . . I just want to note - how excited and friendly the bar staff were.  I was dining alone and they made me feel welcome and had a lot of pride in making sure my 'experience' was just that - something I would remember.  They delivered on that by being friendly, knowledgable and genuinely excited to provide a first class experience.. . A Mojito to drink and for starter I had the Yucatan Chicken Skewers...Excellent... . For Main Course I had the honey chipotle glazed bone in Ribeye - a stunning steak, tender and delicious... . Overall an A+ experience - so good I ate there the next night too :-). . Well done Mesa Grill Staff - Everything was perfect and I cant wait to eat there again.. . Martin B
FALLEN MICHELIN STAR. . There are some people who don't Bobby Flay because he seems to be cocky. Let's not forget he's classical trained and because of that he's one of the few celebrity chefs in Food Network who gives great cooking tips. I went here because this was the only Michelin Star that he ever earned. This restaurant is no longer a Michelin Star. (Michelin no longer does star ratings on Las Vegas restaurants.) I've eaten at a number of Michelin Star restaurants, but I've eaten at restaurants that were at that time were Michelin Star rated but no longer has a star (Fleur de Lys and Alexander's Steakhouse). So eating here would provide me a good comparison to restaurants that are currently Michelin Star rated and those who were in the past.. . I ate here last night. The menu is straightforward a la carte unlike the trendy tasting menu. My server recommended the signature dish is the New Mexico Pork Tenderloin. He also said Mesa is known for their margaritas. I had two items that I plan to ordered. I always see Flay mentioning about blue corn. There were two blue corn items: 1) Blue Corn Pancake 2) Blue Corn Lobster Tacos.  At the suggestion of my server I ordered the lobster tacos.. . The Mesa Grill Margarita arrived before any of my dishes. It was a refreshing drink to start with. The first dish was the lobster tacos. For $20 I was disappointed. There are 3 mini tacos in a blue corn shell. You can taste the spices and lobster however I couldn't taste the blue corn. I should have ordered the Blue Corn Pancake. The entree, which is the signature dish of Mesa Grill, New Mexico Pork Tenderloin was a tastier dish than the lobster tacos. This is one of the more underrated spiciest dishes I ever had. There are the medallions that are covered in spices. Eating this dish takes a while to finish. But in doing so you enjoy each pork medallion, which was moist and tender. I decided not to order dessert.. . So what was the verdict? When I go a fine dining restaurant I want to learn what its cuisine is about. Mesa is supposed to be known for southwest flavors. However when I ate here last night I never understood what southwest flavors were. From other Michelin Star restaurants I've eaten I learned and understood what their cuisine was. Two prime examples are two restaurants in San Francisco: Boulevard and Aziza. When I ate at Boulevard I understood what California cuisine is. When I ate at Aziza I understood what Moroccan cuisine is. But to be fair to Mesa, in comparison to other former Michelin Star restaurants, Mesa is better than Fleur de Lys (San Francisco) but not as good as Alexander's Steakhouse (Cupertino). I think a 3-star rating in my book is fair.. . Will I eat at Mesa again? Maybe. However I regret not ordering the Blue Corn Pancake and Chile Relleno. If I did maybe rating would be different. Who knows in the future if Michelin would start rating Las Vegas restaurants?  If Michelin does I can't see Mesa garner its star back at the moment.
In my opinion it is nothing stellar, maybe I wasn't quite into the menu as my boyfriend was. It is still a great meal Bobby Flay delivers as usual the service was very attentive to each detail, really enjoyed that.
Mesa Grill never disappoints. I recommend the blue corn pancake, the chile rubbed pork tenderloin, and the lamb chops. The margaritas are potent and they have a good wine list.. . As with any celebrity chef restaurant, you won't see anyone you know in the kitchen, but the staff here consistently gives good service and good food. We end up booking a dinner here every year and we always leave happy. . . And since you will always get lost in Caesar's Palace, the tip to finding this restaurant is to look for the sports book. It's adjacent to that.
Horrible customer service. Servers were rude and got our order wrong. We will not be going back. The food was decent but not worth the hassle.
One word, phenomenal. Not only is the food delicious, the service is as well. Worth every penny. I had the tiger shrimp corn garlic tamale the sauce really pulled this together. I wanted to ring out the corn husk it was served in to get every last bit of it. My entree was a cornmeal crusted chile relleno. Great presentation and an even better taste. All I can say here is make reservations.......
Service is excellent! Food is fantastic. Can't say the same for other restaurants in caesars P. definitely will make this the place to go, when we visit again.
Went for brunch and got the blue corn buttermilk waffle with the spicy mango glazed bacon...yum! Great wait staff, nice mellow atmosphere and good food!
Great food. I had the Mesa burger and it was cooked perfectly. My fiance had the tuna on mini crackers which were very appetizing and tasty. My friends are said that their respective lunches were really good too. The interior is really modern and interesting.
