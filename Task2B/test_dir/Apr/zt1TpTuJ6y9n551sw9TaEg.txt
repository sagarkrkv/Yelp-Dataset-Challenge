I wanted to love this place, I did. I talked everyone into go to the Cesars Palace one (it is said to be #1 afterall!) but after getting a 2 hour wait no one else wanted to go. So we ended up here.. . I called ahead and was told no wait, obviously things can change. We waited about 5-10 minutes to pay. It was $109 for my hubby, me and my 7 year old son who wouldn't eat much. We got into another line. This one took about 30 minutes. And I was getting anxious. They told us they will take the food away at 9:15 and here it is 7:55 and I am still in line! . . The selection was meh. I was so depressed they did not have creme brulee. The prime rib was great but I really was not very impressed with their selection of food or dessert. I wish I would of tried this place for brunch not dinner. All in all a disappointment  :(
I caught the yumminess in it's last half hour for dinner. Even though the experience was cut short, it was worth it. I definitely will come back to enjoy a tasteful experience. . . Presentation of the tapa size portions is best for me because I can experience all that is offered. My favorite was the shrimp and polenta for entrees, and the Rice Krispies for the deserts.
This is probably one of the better buffets vegas has to offer. . . We went for brunch and beat the long lines. The choices are much more exotic such as the eggs benedict, gnocci, duck legs, Etc. They have a good salad bar, yogurt and granola, breads and spread, etc.. . The dessert section had ice cream, little cakes, panna cotta, a lovely passion fruit cake, croissanta, donuts, chocolate covered strawberries, and more.. . While buffets aren't the highest quality of food, wicked spoon does a good job of keeping things fresh and interesting.
We ate at their Sunday brunch this last week.  Adult price was 34 and children was 18.  The prime rib was delicious.   Crab legs were on the small side.   The selection is limited compared to other buffets.   For instance, only one kind of salad and dressing. Chinese food offering was sub par.   We went again on a weekday for lunch too.   Adult price was 26 and I think the children price was 16.  We showed up at 1 to find out that the buffet closes at 2 and reopens around 5.  They call it brunch on the weekdays and so there was still breakfast at 2.  They had a tri tip roast which was juicier than most other buffet's prime rib.  In general,  small selection, but what they do offer is for the most part above average.
After all the rave reviews from Yelp users, personal friends, and 'best Vegas buffet' articles, I had very high expectations for Wicked Spoon.  After not eating all day and paying $44 for dinner there (on a Saturday night), I was ready to grub.  From Asian, American, Italian, and seafood, they had a wide range of food to choose from.  I liked how they had a macaroni and cheese bar - you chose the toppings and someone made it for you.  It was hearty/heavy/and yummy.  I also liked how they served some of the dishes in small buffet portions, so as not to waste food.  They had cute tiny pots and pans you could load onto your plate.  For dinner though, I mostly stuck to the seafood: ceviche, crabs, and mussels.  . . Ambience and enviornment is amazing.  I really like how the restaurant was set up and decorated.  The designer did a great job. . . At the end of the day though, what we pay for is the food.  The mussels were yummy, but nothing really blew my mind away...except for dessert.  I made the right decision in choosing Thai Iced Tea flavored gelato.... OH MY GOSH - whatever you do,  get this!  I wish this was sold in local grocery stores, because this is what they did right.. .  Would I return to Wicked Spoon?  Yes.  I would like to try this place for brunch!  I would also return for dinner, but only during the week.
This is one of the best buffets I've ever been too. You have choices of Middle eastern food, American, Italian and Chinese/Japanese with some deserts. My favorite were the primer ribs and lamb chops. It's about $41 per person for dinner. It gets crowded around 7pm. We went around 5pm and it wasn't busy then. The bathroom is also clean and nice.
Holy yum. Wicked Spoon really lives up to the hype as one of the best (if not the best) buffets ever.. . Arrived here on a whim with some girlfriends after checking into our hotel. Upon arriving, our wait was fairly short and we were seated at a clean, large table. The buffet options are ENDLESS. Literally. There is food from nearly every corner of the earth, and the little stylistic touches of serving certain dishes in mini steel pots or little Chinese take-out boxes were adorable. My favorite dishes were the ceviche, shrimp n grits (significant because I normally hate grits), paella, and panko crusted salmon (I think you get the gist, I'm a HUGE seafood fan). The salad bar was amazing as well--so many different salad options with a diverse range of toppings, which is excellent since I'm very picky about salad fixings. I barely had enough room for dessert--and by that I mean I literally only had room to sample a couple of dessert options. Wicked Spoon is an awesome buffet and I'll be sure to stop by here next time I'm in Vegas!
A wonderful array of high quality dishes! Highlights included the bone marrow, the mac n cheese bar, the chicken wings, the ceviche and other small seafood dishes, and the chocolate lava cake (which tasted more like a souffle) for dessert. On a different level compared to other Las Vegas buffets.
Went to wicked spoon for the second time and it wasn't as good as bacchanal, however it is a bit cheaper.. . The food was ok wasn't much selections and they didn't have the bone marrow that everyone was raving about. Prime rib a bit salty. Wasabi Mash was good. Octopus salad and kale salad were both good.
I love this buffet. I love the small plates of food. I have never been a person to go to buffet and load my plate with heaping spoonfuls of food just to take 1 bite of this and nibble of that. Waste really bothers me so when these nice buffets started this portion control I became a big fan of buffets. Lots of choices everyone leaves happy!
"A bloody mary first thing, a bite at the King's Head, couple at the Little Princess,stagger back here and bang... back to the bar for shots." -- Shaun of the Dead (2004). . Buffets are hit or miss for me - they can either be stellar and full of amazing bites, or kind of gross and disappointing.  I had heard great things about Wicked Spoon from a friend who had visited last year, so we hoofed it to the Cosmopolitan from Mandalay Bay.  We were not disappointed.. . We were greeted by lovely hostesses and walked to our table.  Our server immediately asked us what would we like to drink - the other 4 ladies opted for mimosas (bottomless) while I went for the bloody mary (also bottomless).  Our drinks would be half full and a new one would be delivered - that's what I call service.. . Our timing was such that breakfast items were still out and they were slowly being replaced with lunch items - so we got the best for both worlds. Pastries, eggs, ham, bacon, pancakes, waffles. etc. And then came the lunch items - quiches, pork loin roast, roast beef, mac and cheese, shrimp, stir frys and more.  . . Everything I ate was delicious and well-prepared. There was just so much of it, and I wish I had a bigger stomach, or maybe a second one so I could enjoy it all.  The service was spot-on - the emptied plates were cleared out quickly so i had a cleared place when I returned with a new one. Our server was also delightful and quite personable. . . I would come back for the food, the service, the cleanliness of the establishment and all for a great price. And the drinks were potent and ever flowing.  I'll be back again.
Outstanding food quality, and variety of choices, but not worth $44 per person. The $10 refillable house wine option sounds great, but with slow service I was lucky to flag down the server for 1 refill.
Good food, good company I cant complain
I came here back in March and it was awesome. We came for breakfast with no line, most likely because it was 10 am. I was amazed at the selection of breakfast foods available. First off there were your typical breakfast items like sausage, bacon, eggs but there were more items to choose from. . . I was especially amazed by the smoothie shots, creeps and dessert. Definitely tempted to bring my bf back here with me.
OMG! I wanted a brunch style buffet on a Tuesday and this was the only place that offered brunch items. 7 of us went even though 4 different friends told us it wasn't that great!  We will check their taste buds when we get home. OMG they don't know anything about great food and great service. . EVERYTHING was so delicious and the presentation was FABULOUS!  My eyes didn't know where to start or finish.  A big mahalo to our waitress (I'm sad I can't remember her name) who told the pastry chef it was our anniversary and she wrote on a plate in chocolate "happy 25th anniversary". OMG what a wonderful way to start our next 25years. Mahalo Nui Loa Wicked Spoon for making our silver anniversary a very memorable event and we look forward to spending our golden anniversary with you!
I don't need to say much, this was the best brunch/buffet in Las Vegas, hands down!!! I won't visit Vegas again without coming here. Delicious!
I've always been slightly concerned that a buffet is a hit or a miss when it came to adequate quality, but not a Las Vegas buffet that is. Had I never been to one before and always felt quite skeptical if it meets up to par, and so glad that a Las Vegas buffet was my first. After our exciting outing at the day pool at Wet Republic, we went to the Wicked Spoon to replenish ourselves for the evening ahead of us. Besides, after the fun we had in the pool, we were looking for good food to eat!. . The cover admission was about $51, and this was at about a quarter after 5pm. The food that were on display was incredible; they had anything from Middle Eastern to European delectables; my ultimate favourite. I wanted to try everything and anything, but I had to chose wisely (I want to fit into my dress for the evening of course). I immediately scanned the European station that had delicious Spanish inspired mashed potatoes/polenta, French baked salmon, a mac + cheese station (we made one with salmon of course, it was the best!), and steamed mussels in white wine & cream base (I made sure to take advantage of this, I did not care). There was also bone marrow, and yes, we took quite an advantage of those as well. . . I skimmed through the Asian station, but my friends said some of the items like the egg rolls, some chicken dishes were adequate. There was a carving station as well, but I do not consume red meat often so I actually stayed clear from that although one of my girlfriends did comment that the prime rib was surprisingly tasty. I'm also a very big proponent of dips, and I'm not so sure as to why! I love babaganouj with cucumbers so I made sure to stock up on those as well. It was delicious and made just right.. . However, if you truly know me, European pastries is where my palette calls. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with any of the dessert selection, and even the mango macaron wasn't good either. The only cake I can recall being memorable was probably the carrot cake (which is my favourite cake). . . As Wicked Spoon being my first Las Vegas buffet, I was happy, satisfied, and impressed. I look forward to dining here again, and I hear that their menu changes quite frequently, a good plus! x
Unbelievable buffet! This was the one restaurant my boyfriend HAD to come back to when visiting Vegas. Very modern, spacious, and tucked away in the Cosmopolitan. . . I was really impressed with the vast array of foods and the desserts... oh my god. ENDLESS. .  . Some of my favorites:. Shepherd's pie (potatoes are amazing). Gnocchi (melt in yo' mouf). Curried rice. Mussels (incredible sauce). Pizza. Watermelon+Sriracha . Chicken tacos. *I can't remember everything since there was so much*. . Desserts:. Thai iced tea gelato. Pistachio gelato (real pistachio pieces... SO GOOD). Raspberry rice krispy treat. Pistachio chocolate cake . Oreo chocolate dipped strawberry. . Please check this buffet out if you are visiting Vegas! Won't be disappointed. :-)
Loved it! Best buffet I've ever been to (but I haven't been to Bacchanal, etc). Coming here for brunch was a no-brainer, since my friend flew United and got those 2-for-1 deals which the airline hands out on flights to Vegas apparently. The line for the Cashier was pretty short at noon on a Friday, there was however I line to get seated. There was a minor inconvenience during the paying process, which is why I think the cashier put us in the VIP line to get seated, which was awesome!. We didn't partake in the AYCD mimosa/champagne deal ($10 extra), because the rest of my crew didn't wanna be day drunk, but it the people around us looked quite happy and buzzed and the refills kept coming. I would definitely do it next time.. The food was amazing and most of it was served in cute little individual pots, pans, shot glasses etc. They definitely didn't have to lure people in the promise of standard crab legs.. Some of my favorites were the duck wings, the pork belly, the mussels, and the 2 types of eggs benedicts (and obviously shrimp cocktails!). They had some interesting options like bone marrow, cute mini salads (the mini nicoise was adorable, with quail eggs!), and squid ink pasta (which didn't taste like much). My friends also really loved the gnocchi. They also have good options for veggies.. People rave about the desserts, but that wasn't my favorite section, but maybe it was because I was already stuffed. They had a gelato bar, I tried the strawberry balsamic, but I couldn't really taste the balsamic.. I would definitely like to come back!
Rating 4.5 stars. . My husband and I went to 3 buffets while in Vegas and this was the best one. We went for Friday Brunch. . . They had this fantastic eggs Benedict with a hollandaise sauce that was to die for. I'm not lying. I almost licked my plate. . . I also had some French toast, and sausage and bacon (had to knock off .5 star here because the meat was cold-not sure why).. . The dessert station was the best. They were all smaller so you can sample more. I had a white chocolate mousse. Drooool. . . Total price with endless mimosas for two : 76 (not including tip). Worth every penny!
We were staying at the cosmopolitan and had 1 of those 2 for 1 vouchers so we decided to try the brunch at 11am.  Queue was moderate and we were seated within a few minutes.  The price itself was also reasonable - $26/head.  The spread was quite extensive but a lot of carbo and not that much meat.  Taste was above average.  Not sure I would come back again.  It was good value for money but would have liked a wider range.
Have to admit this is one of the best buffet I have eaten so far in Vegas. They have a lot variety of food to choose from. From American to Asian. What got  me was that they have pork belly and bone marrow. I ate so much of that I might  have to get my cholesterol check when I get back to LA. The pork belly was so tender and  juicy well season and the skin was nice and crispy. They had a nice variety of dessert. Love there gelato section. The services was outstanding. I highly  recommended Wicked Spoon buffet.
My personal all time buffet favorite. . Food - Excellent. Almost everything I had here was delicious.  This is in itself not superior to other high-end buffets, but what sets them apart for me is variety.. There are many high end buffets in Vegas that put king crab legs and and cocktail prawns as centerpieces of their offering.  Wicked spoon on the other hand has many slightly off the wall items.  This include duck wing and rice, bone marrow, squid ink pasta in addition to the 'normal' buffet selections.  Suckling pig was also on offer although not during my last visit.  As expected of a high end buffet, desert was excellent.. . Price - Good. About $40 for brunch, which is expected / on par with their competition. . Service - Good. Wait staff is pretty quick and attentive with refilling drinks / clearing out empty plates.  Note that during busy weekends the wait can be rather long.  Once I had to wait close to 50 minutes during a holiday weekend. . Overall, I haven't found another buffet that is as high quality and offers better variety as Wicked Spoon.
I've always been a buffet type of guy n always want a buffet to have a good set of seafood selection, this place didn't have a good varieties of choices but it was good quality grub.word.
I love that this buffet looked fancy! But the food was not too great. I only liked a few dishes. I loved the mussels in that cream or milk sauce- I wish I can remember what it's called! I also loved the bone marrow, which you can eat with lemon and salt. So they have the typical crab legs- which disappointed me because they only serve it cold. The dessert definitely turned me down. Nothing to look forward to. It's the only buffet that I went to that I didn't find anything I liked. I at least tried everything for the desert. But everything were a failure- at least to me. It was blunt, or it tasted like cheap bakery treat.
What a cool place- and man do I wish I had taken a Grandma sized purse (with extra ziplocs) and a bigger appetite as neither the husband nor I had seen a buffet quite like this before. . . I have been out of the swing of life for a bit so I haven't done any entertaining for much longer than I would like to admit but this place got all of my little foodie serving gadgets and gizmos ideas working. I loved the concept of this place-and though there were plenty of things served "buffet style", most offerings came in individual serving sized containers or portions. Mini fryer baskets with fried chicken, mini take out Chinese containers with noodles or fried rice, cast iron skillets with mac and cheese, a risotto offering in a small cassoulet dish and the list goes on. . . The dessert area was one like I have never seen including a full gelato station with several flavors offered. The husband imbibed in the dessert offerings quite a bit but sadly, I was too full. . . Since we were in Vegas celebrating our 5th Anniversary, it didn't dawn on me that we would be in town for Chinese New Year AND the Super Bowl. Due to this, there were a lot of very pretty but not for me types of offerings either ingredient or textural wise. There were some hits and some definite misses on some of the "regular" items but this is the genius thing about a buffet though-lots of offerings for all different taste buds.. . I will try this place again in a heartbeat and hopefully will get to feel a bit more Wicked!
Great place! Got here at 11:00 on a Saturday, only a small line, got in at about 11:20. I noticed at noon the line got quite longer so glad we came a bit early.. . Very elegant decor! Food was amazing, especially the desserts! A bit of a lack of seafood though (ie no crab legs), which is only negative and why 4/5. Service was excellent, was attended to immediately after sitting down. Plates were cleared quickly.. . Great overall experience. About $35 for brunch or so (we didn't get alcohol). Would come again but will prolly try Bellagio or Wynn next time.
One of my favorite buffets.
Fail fail fail!!! Thought about trying this place before leaving Vegas and it was a fail.. Everything is not good. The only thing good is the Mac n cheese bar, how do u mess up in that. Try ceasars if u wanna eat a buffet
Amazing experience! Come hungry! Everything is good,  so try and pace yourself. Good luck with that, though.
Great quality of food with various selection. Wonderful interior design that makes you feel comfortable eating there. Professional waiter/waitress just upgrade your experience of dinning! Highly recommend it!!!
Is there a better buffet in Las Vegas?  I think not!  They don't just throw food into hot trays under heat lamps here, they also actually make it look appetizing by putting some effort into the presentation.  There wasn't a single item on my multiple plates of food that I took just a single bite of and pushed to the side as I oftentimes do with buffet food.. . Seriously wicked spread!
The food was horrible. Do not waste your money.
The Wicked Spoon is a buffet at the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas.  'Nuff said, right?  Not even close!. . Background:  A friend of mine and I were flying to Vegas with a room booked at the Cosmo.  As we neared landing, the flight staff came around handing out these little packets.   Packets we thought, originally, were packets of gum or something.  Turns out that they were boxes of coupons to places in the Cosmo!  Amazing luck, right? .  . One of the coupons was for a discount to the Wicked Spoon, so we went for lunch while we waited for the rest of our crew to arrive.  I saw that it was a buffet and quickly lowered my expectations; granted, Vegas is known for amazing buffets.  None the less, I prepared to eat what I needed, and get out.  I pilled several plates with an assortment of, beautifully presented, foods.  First bite - oh my God.  I had the eggs benedict over pulled beef or something.  I was totally blown away!  This experience was repeated with each new item I tasted and I quickly surpassed the realm of "satisfaction" and entered the world of "ugghhh... I'm sooo full!". . Summary:  the Wicked Spoon is, to date, the best buffet I've been to on the Las Vegas strip - including the village at Paris (by far).  If you're in the area and are hungry, do yourself a favor and stop in!
Hard to decide how to rate this. The food was good, hot, and nicely presented. But that should be the norm here in Las Vegas. . . I was going to give 4 stars, but I used the restroom - and was appalled by how disgustingly dirty it was. Two stalls were unmentionable, the rest had paper and dirt on the floor.  And last but not least...they were out of soap in all the dispensers. This was 10:00 on a weeknight!. . Anyway, food was decent, bathrooms NOT.
Always a tasty treat when we're in Vegas. This is hands down my favorite buffet in Vegas because they offer peeled cocktail shrimp, crab legs, and THE BEST PRIME RIB! It comes out to be about $39 + tax per person.  Not to mention the dessert island has rotating sweets and a huge selection of gelato! . . A MUST TRY in you're in Vegas!
Everyone was raving about this place.  Pictures made it look super awesome.  . . Please don't believe when people tell you this is the buffet to check out.  Food was TERRIBLE... I didn't even go for seconds.  I couldn't eat what was in my plate.   Poor choice in food combination.   After the disappointment of the food, I was hoping the dessert was going to be the topping to what every foodie was raving about. COMPLETE disappointment, I couldn't believe  dessert looked so good but tasted like NOTHING!!!   The Wickedspoon needs to step it up.  Not worth what your paying for.         . . Honestly, I was expecting so much more....
Very nice establishment and super convenient if you are staying at the Cosmo.  However, for the price ($44), you can get slightly better food at some of the other buffets.  I'm a big fan of cured meats and sushi but the sushi was definitely not the best and the cured meats consisted of two different types of salami.  Also, I've heard lots of good things about the dessert section and they do have a handful more flavors of gelato/ice cream than other buffets, but the dessert section as a whole is not any bigger than other Vegas buffets I've been to.  I might go back if I stay at the Cosmo again, but I think at this price there are other options to choose from.. . If Chris Brown was in town, he would probably pass on this place.
Any good buffet has a wait which should be an hour or so. but on our visit there was not one person in line at 4pm. It's a small buffet with a a mediocre size selection and variety. . . I have to agree with some of the reviews...a lot of the stuff in the pictures is nowhere to be found. The best thing served at this buffet is the Mac & Cheese station and the guys where so nice...you can have all types of ingredients from bacon, ham, sausage and many more fixings made to order and very scrumptious. . . I also think that for the price the crab legs should be hot and the guy behind the counter didn't even offer to heat them for us. All in all it's an ok buffet but way over priced.
Not sure why this place has 4 Stars. The food here really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. LITeRaL!!. I went here last night 4/18/2014, my husband and I had read the reviews and though he was skeptical, I convinced him to go. When we walked in the atmosphere was really nice, trendy, clean, roomy. But once we got to the food stations, things turned for the worse. Luckily, my husband got a refund while I on the other hand wasted $41, to eat tasteless food. I don't plan on coming back. Here's why::. . Con's. 1) The food was either over or under cooked. I grabbed a box of the pre made Chinese noodles and they were over cooked, ingredients did not taste fresh,like maybe they were cooked and sat out for a few hours. Also, I grabbed a drumstick of the Tandori chicken and it was way undercooked. . 2) Limited options for none meat-eaters. Because I don't eat beef for pork I only had a couple of options for chicken and fish. The teriyaki chicken was undercooked. Also,  the friend chicken, taste like they had been using recycled oil, YUCK! I pretty much ate small slices of pizza and their caeser salad (that's not worth $41 bucks).. 3) More with the taste, even the cookies were not fresh, they tasted like pre-packaged cookies.. 4) The variety was limited overall.. . Pro's. 1) atmosphere. 2) MacN Cheese station (this was cool.)
I was not that impressed with Wicked Spoon.  First off, the buffet is located in an obscure corner of the building (a little bit of hike if you coming off the Strip).  The decor is nice (probably because it's one of the newer buffets).  While the presentation of the food (in the small little pans and pots) is impressive, the quality of the food is just OK.  There is a good variety but I found most of the dishes somewhat bland in flavor.  Also, prepping the food in the pots and pans has it's drawbacks.  Many of the dishes were kept warm with heat lamps and we found that that tended to dry out the top of many of the dishes.  Also, if you just wanted to have a tasting, you had to take the whole serving dish.  We felt like we wasted a lot of food.  Service, like most other LV buffets, is very good.   . . We went for weekend brunch.  At $40/pp, it's a little on the pricier side and I was expecting a little more.  IMO, The Buffet at the Wynn is still my favorite LV buffet, better selection and better quality food.
Had high expectations of this place. I try almost every buffer in vegas and this was on the top of my list. Granted I came here for their brunch buffet, I was disappointed there were no crab legs. Their salad station was great, beet salad, kale salad, smoked salmon etc. had to go back for seconds. . Their fried chicken in a little basket was cute but i was not a fan of their macaroni and cheese. Being Asian, their asian section was not appealing. Sushi was not appetizing and their Chinese dishes were boring.. Dessert station was ok. Best thing was their heath bar dipped chocolate strawberry.. I think i may have to try their  dinner buffet but after the brunch here i might skip it and go to the Baccanal Buffer at the Ceasars.
My fiance and I originally were going to eat at the Bacchanal or the Wynn Buffet, but we were so tired of walking that we decided to give the Wicked Spoon a try. We were pleasantly surprised. the food all was really good here. Its a smaller buffet, but the emphasis here is on flavor. I also got the $10 all you can drink Wine pass. Next time I will skip that. I was so involved with food that I kept forgetting to drink. Our favorites were:. The Mac and Cheese Bar(my favorite thing on the buffet). Apricot White Chocolate Desert. Ceviche. Butternut Squash Salmon. Chicken Wings. Cheese Bar. Duck Wings. Cocktail Shrimp(actually a decent size and cooked well.. Squid Salad. Chocolate strawberries. . Things to skip. -Squid Ink Pasta (noodles were kinda rubbery). -Tacos(meat was kind of dry). -Macaroons(never had one before so maybe I just don't like macaroons). -Gelato(nothing special save room for the other desserts). . They serve everything in small portioned containers so you can try a bit of everything. We definitely would eat at this buffet again. The only reason why I took it down a star is that its a buffet. Sorry that may be a snobby opinion, but that's how I feel. :) The service was also good.
Wicked Spoon was very decent for dinner and breakfast - it did not blow my mind and is not the best Vegas buffet I've ever been too, but it is quite decent and I would go there again for convenience if I was stayed at Cosmopolitan again.  I loved the boiled peanuts (my family is from Hawaii and I can eat a mountain of these!)!  I also loved the meats, mashed potatoes, fish, lobster, vegetables.  For breakfast, I loved the boiled peanuts (!!), made to order omelette, hashbrowns, lox bagels. Mmmm!  And don't forget the chocolate covered strawberries!!  They also offer buffet to go, so inquire about that in case you don't have time for the whole buffet experience.  A-ok service -- I think maybe we went back for rounds so often so fast that they couldn't quite keep up clearing our plates, but otherwise, they are attentive with drinks and requests.
Best Buffet in Vegas 2014!!! My favorites are the octopus poke, duck wings, kale salad, crab curry fried rice and a lot more...for dessert, the xl chocolate dipped-strawberries, macarons, pistacio gelato & the chocolate molten cake. I'm definitely coming back.
3125 reviews, 4328 photos, & a 4-star rating of the Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmopolitan of Vegas. I loved what I read & the pics that I saw of the many upscale-type offerings + their unique presentations.  I was looking forward to trying this AYCE, as my expectations were based on high standards from similar previous buffet experiences at Bellagio, Wynn, & Paris..  . However, I was so disappointed in my dining experience at WS for the following reasons:. . - Changes in the buffet offerings.   Many of the buffet offerings were not reflective of early Yelp reviews/photos posted since it opened in Dec. 2010. Foods were at one time presented in unique eye-catching servers in small portions so that you could try as much as possible, i.e., samples in mini pots, serving spoons, & bowls. While there were a few creative servings, e.g., noodles in Chinese take-out containers, fried chicken in mini fryer baskets, & boiled peanuts in paper cones, most of the food items are in large servingtrays; just grab a serving spoon& serve yourself, just as in any buffet. Perhaps it proved to be too labor-intensive to offer so many individualized portions. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=VkwXpPWxl7tN4yK8ETxjLA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=J9VUSLI3495TZ2MFxhpgvA . . - Many of the foods were not palatable. For example, the Chinese roast pork had crispy skins, but they were so tough that they were inedible; the snow crab legs were served cold, & they were the tiniest crab legs that I have ever seen w/ more shell than meat. Food items were simply overcooked, dried out from standing under a warmer for a length of time, & just plain tasteless. (Must give WS credit though, for offering upscale items, e.g., bone marrow, blackened fish, mac & cheese bar, kale salad; but they also had many items similarly offered at other buffets, e.g., pizzas, breads, teri chicken, beef ribs, potatoes, etc.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=-D60mxtVvUjwZ68IBp0YhQ . . - No lines to get into the buffet.  The top buffets in Vegas always have long lines that zigzag like you're waiting for a ride in Disneyland.  We walked right in for dinner at 6pm on a Tuesday evening w/ no lines whatsoever.  The dining room was not crowded. There apparently wasn't a demand for this buffet.. . - Buy one get one free offer was not available. Prior to leaving for Vegas, the local newspaper had an article re United Airlines offering a BOGO coupon for the WS on its Vegas flights; Yelp reviews also made mention of it. As I was flying on UAL, I asked the flight attendant on the Vegas leg re the coupon, & she/other attendants didn't know anything about it; never got the coupon. While we were at WS, I asked the manager, who said that the coupons were given out on only certain flights, such as those coming from Newark, NJ, but he was uncertain as to which flights. Although we had our UAL boarding passes, he said he could not honor those & could only honor the coupons if we had them. Then he told me to bring this to the attention of UAL, as they should clarify as to which flights had the coupons, while thanking me for bringing this to his attention so that he could alert his marketing people. . . You would think that giving one BOGO coupon as a goodwill gesture would hardly make a dent in its profits. No deal.  Plus, wonder why they're even giving BOGO coupons - is it because there's no longer the demand of people flocking to it?. . - The price is high considering what you get. We paid $38/person for dinner on a weekday night ($47 on weekends). While the service is adequate, the quality of the food items does not justify this price. . . The saving grace for this buffet is its dessert station.  They had a wonderful gelato/sorbet bar (loved the Thai iced tea & salted peanut caramel flavors) & heavenly huge chocolate-covered strawberries garnished w/ oreo cookie bits or Heath crunch bits. The extensive dessert station included chocolate molten lava cakes, pretty decorated cakes, raspberry/chocolate coffee rice krispy treats, red velvet cookies, parfaits, apple strudel, panna cotta, white chocolate mousse cones, macarons, etc.  Most of the desserts were excellent, but I would not pay $38 just to eat their desserts. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=6PSAjVXFwaLgYS3mN4I30Q  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=m4V11SUeP5XB1V3q9j_WNg .  . At least I can say I've dined here. Would I come here again? No.
One of my favorite buffets to go to. Their chocolate covered strawberries are like the ones you pay 5$ for at Godiva! So dank!. . They have a variety of dishes that are personalized. By personalized I mean... Most buffets have a tray of fried chicken but this one has them in little fryer buckets. . .  My favorite thing I had was probably duck with pesto, the strawberries, and this curried rice with cauliflower mash. . . I went for brunch this time and even tho it's cheaper.. Dinner is by far the better choice
hands down the best freaken buffet ive ever eaten at in my life thus far. i personally think its better than that bacchanal buffet and well priced. i came here for brunch with my husband and it was 27.99 per person. 37.99 if u wanna do unlimited mimosas/bloody marys/ and other things which i dont remember. the food there was soo good! im being super hungry just thinking about it. down to their small ramekins of scrambled eggs to their bone marrow station everything was amazing. it was so good that the next time we come to vegas we are definately staying at the cosmopolitan just so the buffet is in  our hotel! CANT WAIT TO COME BACK :D
Rather than rehash everyone else's review, I'll just say the quality of the food is excellent, the unique items you can get (like bone marrow) blew me away. Why 3 stars? It didn't have a lot of variety. . . So if you don't mind the lack of variety compared to other buffets, then 5 stars! Otherwise, I think the hype isn't worth it
No wait at 5 on Monday after easter. $38 each , well worth it for this amazing buffet . Beautiful restaurant and friendly staff. Not many offerings for young children , and dessert choices were not so impressive. However the quality of the food made for little room for it anyway .
First of there is a line to pay not a big deal. But wait after you pay you get placed in another long wrapping line to get seated. The service was awful the staff was putt out when they cleared dishes never got a refill.  The food made it three stars it had a great variety most of the dishes were good and well prepared. I don't know what the deal is with the cosmopolitan hotel but all the services here are poor
Okay, business trip and eating a buffet alone..let's see how it goes
Wicked Spoon - AYCE buffet - average check ~$35. What should I say? Expectation exceeded Perception. I expected the most well known buffet in Las Vegas suppose to be extraordinary from service to food. Yet, service wasn't even there, I meant ur in Cosmopolitan and service isn't the best you could find here in Vegas. Food is ok, nothing special especially I come during Brunch time on a friday so they serve egg and bacon? WTF. 3.5/5 because the place is really really beautiful and luxurious beside that nothing else worth it. With the price so high and nothing special, would never come back, gotta try Bacchanal at Cersars next time.
1st time loved it. 2nd time, I don't know if the quality dropped but it wasn't as great as the 1st time. Overall, it's still good.
Worth the wait! We came in on Saturday around noon, waited about 45 minutes to get a table. Bottomless mimosas for $12 are a must! Food highlights: angry mac n cheese, loaded mashed potatoes, pecan pancakes, great Asian selection. Save room for dessert!
My first Las Vegas buffet experience ~ I was so full I pretty much gained a few pounds in one sitting! This place makes the buffets around Seattle seem sad and not worth the $$$ you pay to get in. . . The price is $35 which considering all of the choices and presentation I didn't think it was too bad. It's one of the classiest buffets I've been to! The desserts alone would bring me back, but kids you probably can't eat $35 worth of food but it's still a must if you're ever in LV to hit up the buffet! . . I went for Sunday brunch so they had an array of breakfast items. I especially liked the smoked salmon eggs Benedict, there was also beef Benedict but it wasn't as good! The chicken teriyaki thighs were tender and flavored nicely. I wasn't a fan of the crab fried rice. It was made with brown rice and it just didn't work, the noodles (yakisoba and Korean noodles) were just ok! I would probably stick to the shrimp cocktails, eggs Benedict and the meats if I come back! . . All the Chinese food are in these cute takeout boxes! Absolutely adorable, I think all these little touches just made me incredibly giddy about hitting up this buffet! . . The selections were great! From what I can remember there was an Asian station, breakfast/salad bar, seafood and various Italian dishes/meat stations. Pretty much something for everyone! I had two vegetarians in my group and there were plenty of items my ladies could enjoy! . . We all liked the Parmesan risotto which was rich cheesy and well executed. I pretty much tried anything that looked appetizing and it's nice to try items and switch gears if you don't like it. You guys know what I'm talking about-- the dirty looks you get at Asian buffets when it looks like you're wasting food! Not the case here, our waitress was a sweetheart I wish I remembered her name! . . Something that amazed me was the dessert selections! The desserts were beautifully decorated and there were so many choices!!! The ice cream and sorbet selections alone was extensive. The day I was there, I tried thai tea ice cream, peach mango sorbet and tiramisu. Absolutely delicious and incredibly satisfying! After stuffing my face, the ice cream was so good I continued to push myself further into a food coma. I also picked up a handful of pastries and cakes to try. These deserts are fancy! Not your typical Safeway cheesecake cut into cubes. I'm talking passion fruit meringue domes with gold leaf, panna cotta, the list goes on and on!. . I had a fantastic experience here! Wicked Spoon, I'm coming for you next time I'm on Sin City!!!
Typical vegas buffet....loved the selections, interesting is that they serve beef bone marrow in split bone shanks....dinner is $41 per person but if u search for promos and specials online, you could find coupons for buy 1 dinner and get one free. Which we did and came in very handy for our group of 12
It is a very interesting buffet. Love their presentation with the platings. Also, they have small plates, so you can try almost everything. Some things were delicious, while others tasted alright.  The gnocchi looked delicious, but I guess because it was sitting out too long, it didn't taste that great. I don't think I would come back to this place for lunch, but I do want to see the variety they have for dinner.
One of the BEST buffets I have been to...in MY life!!! So many things are great here but I think the things that standout most to me are the 1) great salad, veggie and produce area...they had a delicious kale salad with ginger dressing that was so refreshing and a mushroom with pine nuts was great too. 2) you can get breakfast at 3pm, they had french toast it was sooo cool! 3) desserts which I have to say were my favorite part. Wicked spoon has Creme brulee, a gelato bar, macaroons, and chocolate melting cake! Like the one you get on cruises and it was unlimited pack in as many as you can fit in your tummy!! . Overall a super fantastic experience the only thing I would ask them to do is up the soup selection because I feel like there needs to be more variety. But other than that excellent job wicked spoon!!
Great food. Be selective, there are so many selections. Don't miss the duck wings or pork belly. Well worth $35 for Sunday brunch ($47) for unlimited mimosas or bloody mary. Get ready for afood coma. Don't forget to tip your server for extra attention. Everything was well executed and presented well. Not your usual buffet slop trough.
This review is mostly based on the food quality and the value with the price. . . Overall, I think wicked spoon still offer good selection of food with reasonable quality. A couple items I like include their macroon, Kongbao cauliflower and yogurt. But after buchana, I am very underwhelmed with wicked spoon. I ferl the item selection is much less and the quality is lower as well. For example, for asian food, buchana have various dim sums, stir fries, sushi, dark chicken soup, ramen, pho, thousand year egg kangi. In comparison, wicked spoon has brocoli beef, kongbao cauliflower, chicken fried noodle, miso soup with nothing (no tofu or seaweed or anything). That is it. There may be a couple other cheap chinese buffet itdms and I donot even recognize thrm as asian dishes. . . I would definitely rather spend a little bit more and go to buchanna, much better good seldction and quality. I think it is much better value for the money.
One of my favorite buffets.  Plenty of meats to sample, I enjoy the breakfast as well.  All the food is good and looks good as well.  Not a normal buffet since some work seems to go into presentation.  Check out the desserts if you have belly room.  The various flavors of Gelato should be a hit with most.
I've been to Vegas TONS of times.  Even when good food was cheap on the strip. Prices of great food had gone up quite a bit since the first time traveling to Vegas. I have probably gone to every buffet on the strip and in old town. For the $$, Wicked Spoon I feel is far superior to all the different buffets on the strip. There's so much to choose from but what puts this place far in front of others is the quality of the food. Virtually everything on the buffet are things you could get at a fine dining restaurant. Especially their dessert section. OMG!  from the crumbled heath bar covered strawberries to the large selection of delicious ice cream and sorbets. I could go on and on. Definitely try this place especially those of you that think buffets have horrible food.
Drove to Vegas for the weekend with my friends and got here Friday night. After checking in to our hotel and dropping off our bags, we decided to inaugurate our Vegas trip with dinner at Wicked Spoon because we had all heard pretty good reviews online and through friends that had been here before. We didn't get in too late (maybe around 9ish), but it was already pretty empty. I'm used to spending a bit of money for a good buffet at Vegas, but $50 was still a bit of a surprise to me. . . In terms of service, it's a buffet, so the most I expect is that someone come by to take our drinks order, keep the drinks refilled, and then clear the empty plates are necessary. I'm not a big drinker of liquids (especially at a buffet where the focus of all my stomach space is on food to consume), but my friends waited too long to have their water glasses refilled. I was also kind of taken aback that, for $50, we had to have more than 50% of our dishware traded out because there was still crusted on food from other people's meals still on our glasses, plates, and silverware. Um, ew. There was also a lot of plates in the buffet area that still had food coating on them. What is going on with their dishwashers??. . In terms of the food: I usually like going to the carving station and getting the carved meats there. The prime rib was, imo, just "meh". The first cut I got was good, but the second cut was a bit dry and overdone. The chef manning the station looked like he was on something. He was away half the time, and at one point there was a crowd of people waiting, he opened the door from the back kitchen, looked at us, and then disappeared for another 5min. When he did come back, I asked for medium-rare, and he cut me whatever was there on hand (hint: it wasn't medium-rare). My friend really liked the marinated Korean short ribs, but I thought they were just average. The marinade was good, but I can get the same quality meat at my local Korean supermarket which also pre-marinades it for me. The bone marrow (first time I tried it) was delicious, if you could find any bones with the marrow cooked well enough. Not all of the bone marrow was cooked to the right consistency, and they didn't seem keen on refilling. The shepherd's pie was amazing and awesome. I loved that dish! The crab legs are pre-halved (always a plus for a Vegas buffet), and were also pretty delicious. I saw the mac n cheese station, but the line was too intense, so I passed on that... maybe next time if there is a next time. I did enjoy the various dessert options - varied, visually pleasing, and the flavors were pretty yum. . . Overall, I don't think that the food was terrible. In fact, when I could actually eat, the food was pretty decent. I'm just turned off that for $50 I had to deal with some really unappetizing dirty dishware and a head carver who was MIA more than half the time. Seriously, a lady in front of me thought maybe it was "self-serve". If I were to chance coming back here again I would need some heavy incentive to do so. Otherwise, there are some really yummy alternatives for less of the cost.
This place really is as good as the reviews say. We went there for Sunday Brunch and the place was packed and lines were out the door but it was worth the wait. They have decent vegetarian options and a huge overall selection for salads, appetizers, entrees and desserts.
Best buffet I have ever been to. I don't like buffets... but Wicked Spoon is completely different. The selection of food was amazing to me. The don't just offer the generic brunch items, you can see the culinary efforts behind each item. The French toast... changed my life! haha. Truly was delicious. . . I have seen a few reviews talking poorly of the wait staff. We went to the brunch at 12pm on a Sunday and it was PACKED! Our server, Lisa, was truly awesome. She asked both of our names and used them each time she returned to the table. She must have a great memory but that personal touch was really nice and something lacking in the food industry. She kept our bottomless champagne coming, even bringing 2 glasses for each person everytime she returned. Smart thinking!!. . I definitely will eat here again. LOVE IT
Please, for the love of all that is delicious in the world, if you're in Vegas please visit this buffet as it was one of the most visually gorgeous buffets I've had the pleasure of trying.  . . We were in Vegas for the 2013 IT Expo and I'd come armed with a list of places to see, restaurants to try and shows to see.. . The ridiculously long walk from the taxi drop-off point will help you justify eating absolutely anything you want to once you get there, and the walk through the stunning interior of The Cosmopolitan Hotel is quite a treat in itself.. . It's not the cheapest buffet in the world but let's face it, you're in Vegas and this buffet isn't a Golden Corral food trough.  The decor is stunning, however don't feel pressured to class yourself up as we saw a varied mix of jeans, flip-flops, touristy IVegas t-shirts, bow ties and diamonds. . . The place is packed, so mentally prepare yourself for a few minutes wait.  We were fortunate enough to arrive seconds ahead of a huuuuge Birthday party group, therefore our wait was better than someone arriving a few minutes later.  . . Once inside, the staff were professional and helpful and we didn't feel as if they were trying to rush us out the door.. . The wine menu is decent, the cocktails are varied and the soft drink options are limited but will keep your kids happy.. . I honestly don't know how often they change their menu, but there's a healthy amount of variety on offer to make you feel that you're chowing at a buffet that's on steroids. . . Most of the buffet items are already portioned out into bite sized dishes, giving you the false impression that you're not eating as much as you are.  It also lets you feel like a giant food monster tearing through a land of impossibly perfect micro food.  Indulge your inner giant.. . We went for dinner and sampled, amongst other things:. * A wonderful range of soups and salads. * A decent seafood bar including a nice zingy ceviche, anorexic crab legs, baby octopus salad and a boring prawn cocktail heavy on the tomatoes. * Some nicely done carvery options including the expected lamb, beef and pork with all the predictable sides, prime rib and a magnificent beef marrow on toast. * A standard range of Asian cuisine, including cute mini-Chinese takeout boxes containing an average quality Chow Mein. * The obligatory Mexican and Italian options, heavy on the carbs. * Some excellent cheese options which, although not an extensive selection, are surprisingly varied and very well selected. * An outstanding gelato bar and some stunningly presented desserts that you will tear through like a whirlwind (although no creme brulee, meh). . Overall I don't think everything on offer is as top of the line as it should be, and I didn't feel that there were enough high end items to completely justify the price, however there are some items that are standalone in quality by themselves.  . . There are a huge amount of carb-heavy filler items, all excellently prepared and presented, and the dessert options are glorious.. . Worth a visit, won't change your life BUT you'll remember it fondly and I suspect you might add it to your list of Vegas places to revisit.
Quality 4 star multi course food here. A must if you need your Vegas buffet fix. An eccentric food experience here. Just look at the pics!
After hearing only excellent things about Wicked Spoon, I knew that if I ate anything at all in Vegas, this had to be it. With this in mind, hours after stepping off the plane, we headed over to Wicked Spoon with high expectations and empty bellies. . . I guess it might have been a combination of things---perhaps the bar was set too high in my mind, maybe I should have reserved it for dinner rather than lunch, or perhaps it was just a bad day. I'm not sure. While the buffet wasn't terrible, I definitely don't think that it lives up to its hype. . . We paid around ~$30/pp for lunch on a Friday. This constitutes as weekday lunch, and prices get jacked up dinner and on the weekends. We also added about ~$8 for unlimited mimosas/champagne/bloody marys. Lines, as with most good buffets in Vegas, are to be expected. We spent about 20 minutes in line for the cashier, and then another 10 minutes waiting to be seated. . . Okayyy, so before we get to the nitty gritty of what I didn't like...  It's not completely negative around here, there are a few things that did stand out to me in a most positive light:. -Though I'm not too impressed by the small/individual portions because I found out the next day that Bacchanal Buffet does the same, BUT... I did love the little Chinese takeout boxes for the Asian food. SO. ADORABLE.. -Bone marrow was something that I had been told about beforehand, so I was looking forward to it. Though the sizes are a little bit smaller than what I expected (that day, anyways), the thought alone to include bone marrow in the buffet line is spectacular. Props for whoever thought of it!. -Eggs freakin' benedict---So good, and I could eat these all day! That and the cocktail shrimp, ohh yeeaaah, drop them off to my table by the bucket, please! . -If bottomless drinks are ever even a question, my answer will ALWAYS, be yes! I was able to try all three that they offer, and my favorite by far has to be the mimosa. I have to say, it was pretty strong. They were pretty busy at the time, so our amazing waiter brought our drinks by the doubles---definitely brunching it, Vegas style! . . Now, I knew that the spread wouldn't be as big during lunch compared to dinner. But even with this in mind, I was kind of disappointed with the selections, aside from the two items I mentioned above. If I can't have seafood then the backup to my standby becomes the meats. The roast pork I had was mostly roasted fat. The pork loin I tried was beyond overcooked, and the running joke of lunch was that beef from the carving station was so hard it was almost like eating the ass part of the cow! I tried bits and pieces of other items on the buffet line, and while nothing was particularly bad, nothing blew my mind either---just like my star rating, it was just OK. Most stuff was standard buffet fare. Heavy on the starch items. No macarons that day too, boo! . . If you come here, do it for the mimosas and the eggs benedict. Do all you can to avoid the ass part of the beef!
