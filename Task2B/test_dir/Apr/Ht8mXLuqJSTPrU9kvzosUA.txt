Lights. Sounds. Crowds. Dancers. Music.. . If you like those things, you will love Marquee. I have been twice, once to the day club on a loungy Monday afternoon, and most recently for Sander Van Doorn on a Friday night.. . If you like nightclubs, you will love Marquee. If you don't, you will probably not. For world traveling revelers, you will get a very European style clubbing experience on a weekend for top quality DJs.. . If you love house, electro-house, and related genres, you will love the Funktion-One sound system booming while confetti rains down.. . Typical to the neighborhood, drinks are a lot of money, the women dress to the nines, and big groups of guys will only get in if they buy bottle service or pre-pay.
Besides all the pretty handsome men at the Cosmo and Marquee. I was highly disappointed for my firsttime there :(. My friends and I planned a trip out to Vegas and bought pre sale tickets to see Kaskade on April 6th .. We get there extremely excited, all dressed up and ready to dance... We decide to sit outside for a moment since my legs were killing me from walking, I'm not sure how many flights of stairs that lead us to to the club (wearing heals didn't help). When kaskade gets on we hurry inside and it's packed like no other.. To a point where everyone was pushing and shoving to get out of each others way. I was stuck for a moment in the bustling crowd and couldn't even move. It was ridiculous. I don't know why Marquee had let that many people in all at once, fire hazard ?? We ended up just going into the hip hop room to get some fresh air since they closed the outside.. Waiting to try and go back just in case it cleared up. We go back and it's still packed... We try to bustle our way to the dance floor where kaskade is playing and where the real hype and vibe was .. And the security guard was shooing people away from the dance floor and not letting anyone in :( I was so disappointed and bummed I couldn't see kaskade and that I was only able to hear him on the surround sound.. I knew half the people there wernt even there for kaskade and were there just to be "seen". It was so annoying. After that ridiculousness the boys in our group just decided for us to leave. We ended up randomly at a trashy strip club called Sapphire.. Were we paid $35 each to get in and realize even if we just wanted to chill and drink we had to does another $20 each for one drink. So much for a Vegas trip and trying to see one of your favorite artists to watching trashy women strip for trashy men :( Marquee I was looking forward to an amazing experience :( at least on Friday night for a random adventure I'm so glad I Stumbled across the new Nightclub at the Mandalay Bay called the Light Vegas. We got to go in free with free drink tickets to see A-Trak and it was so much fun... The layout was perfect and you could see everything. If you haven't checked it out yet you should .. They're run by a Cirque du so Leil theme (dancers and performance) and it's beautiful !
I've been to both the Nighclub & Dayclub. At night, the place can get pretty packed. Packed to the point where walking around is a real task. I love the multi level rooms and the decor, but I don't think I can stand in one room for more than an hour. It's just too stuffy!. The dayclub was pretty cool. Granted, this was my first time going to one, but if you like EDM, Marquee brings the big boys in! If you don't want to stand around the DJ booth, you can wade in the knee deep water and have a butt load of space all to yourself. I went for a bachelorette party to hear Kaskade :) Fireworks + pumped up crowd. . Tips for day clubbin':. -Watch your shoes or secure them someplace. Some girls had their shoes stolen, no joke. -No large bags allowed. They'll make you rent a locker which cost $30. Perfectly shareable though.. -$15 drinks, but you can get pitchers. Typical club prices though. . Tips for night clubbin:. -Get there early to wait in line.. -Get on a guestlist. Girls, you better work it.. -Boys will have to pay no matter what. In example, for Halloween it cost $80+
DAYCLUB REVIEW:. . This past weekend was the first time I ever partied at Marquee's Dayclub and let's just say: IT WAS FUN.. . I had a grand time. . . EDM music (not my total favorite), but I was caught up in my day-drunkness and celebrating my birthday to not even care! . . The lines at the bars are ridiculous. People at every corner you turn to. Half naked people! Only two bars: in the front of the patio and the back. There was a dancefloor towards the back bar, where the DJ spun, but it was so small. I feel like people just started making their own dancefloors throughout the place.. . I don't think there is much a difference to the nightclub. Large crowds. Only two differences I noticed was the inside club was closed off and there is daylight out.. . Overall, it was cool. Crowded like crazy. Ladies you're free. Men, depending if you're a male group with no ratios you can vary from 30-50 or more depending who is spinning that day. . . Hope that was kind of helpful!
I wasn't crazy about Marquee due to my last experience, but the last few times I've went changed that.. . The first time since that original review, I don't remember much only that it wasn't bad. We came for Gareth Emery but ended up leaving early because members of our group couldn't hack it.. . The second time, I came for day club. They had a "Halfway to EDC" pool party they threw. It was super hard to get into so we arrived early. We stood in a huge line and eventually got in. . Everything was awesome, though super crowded. Dash Berlin rocked the house and I remember being impressed by the setup of the place more than I had been last two times i had been there. . I also ordered some crazy nachos which were delicious but I couldn't eat very much of because I was still hung over. I still drank though, and had no problems with that. We met some amazing people and had had a great time. I'm very happy I dragged my boyfriend to it and decided to give Marquee another try.. . My third time, last weekend, everything was perfect. The atmosphere was spectacular, and ATB made us dance until we got blisters on the bottoms of our feet. (Which are still killing me, but so worth it.) The setup of the place impresses me more each time I go there, I sware. I just notice more great things about it.. . Oh and it helps that we never had to walk up those crazy high staircases again. That only happened that first time. Now they have a bunch of very operable elevators to get us to the needed floors.. . I love Marquee now. They just blew it the first time I came, but they've certainly redeemed themselves.. . Oh and make sure to hit up Brian T. at Marquee https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uaFOvyGPRvSETSS6Lk8-5A any time you're heading to Vegas and need gust list entry. He's awesome, and covers your entrance into all clubs, not just Marquee.
Definitely one of my favorite clubs minus the fact that there's a shit ton of stars to climb up and down. . My favorite part of the place is the hip hop room. And surprisingly the library. Pretty much only bottle service is up there but there's a balcony inside the club...? Wait whaat haha so cool.. Marquee dayclub is also fun and can get a little crowded.. I love marquee Mondays! They have pretty cool djs that come in and they usually have open bar and free with even ratio. Girls are always free :) . They used to have a little photo booth you can send yourself pictures but I guess it broke because it isn't there anymore :(. Drinks can be expensive but depending on who's serving you it could be worth it. I've noticed in the hip hop room the drinks are always stronger than the one in the main room or outside.
Marquee is a solid 3. My most recent trips to this club have been less than satisfactory. The club is still beautiful, music good, but the main floor is a mess. When you want to get on you have to sneak your way in because bouncers close it off. When you do get on the floor you're packed like sardines. I still have fun in the hip hop room an enjoying the outside club area. . . Marquee day club still a go-to spot.
Loved this place!! Great for couples too, because when it gets too packed on the dance floor, the outside patio/pool/tables area is perfect to cool off. Even though we had not heard of this Dj, he still rocked the house!! Good drinks, good music, great relaxing areas in the club so I don't feel squished like sardines in a box. It was cool that we were staying here, cause we just took the elevator up to our room & bam passed out cold!! We had a grrrrreaat time!!
We had a great time with friends trying the bottle service which was reasonable for 7 people. Service was great and we were able to have fun and talk as we stayed in the quieter part of the club.
We had such a blast at Marquee!!  Lots of different rooms and areas to explore, including a nice outdoors section with bars sprinkled through out and a great dance floor and stage where you can enjoy awesome DJs/music.  The drinks were great - cosmopolitans and you must try a blueberry lemon drop shot - yum!  We met lots of people and drank the night away!  They might need more restrooms but it was easy to find.  Marquee is super fun!!
If you enjoy an overcrowded typical nightclub with fist pumping EDM. This place is for you. I hear that they have a hip hop room that is occasionally open. Call beforehand to see what they are playing. Unfortunately, that is what I did and I was told wrong. Good thing was, we were on the guest list, did not have to pay or wait in line. We pretty much walked in and walked right out. I hate EDM. If you want to hear good hip hop/r&b check out dj Casanova at Paris Chateau.
This place is popular, so it gets filled up to capacity.. My Biggest complaint about the DAYCLUB is the fact the every time I have went they don't have the music volume turned up enough.. Seriously. You shouldn't have to struggle to hear the music walking around or being in the pool. The layout is a bit tight space wise. I love tao beach because they turn up the music and the party. Marquee is kind of like a club that was created by a college fraternity.  They don't quite hit the mark at this club. You seriously got to be shitfaced or coked out to enjoy this place... not a fan.
So we came here on a Friday night around midnight. Since we went with some friends that were staying at the Cosmo, we got in within 10 minutes or so even though we arrived around 11:30 pm and the line was really long. Once inside the music was amazing. The vibe was good as well. Great visuals and go-go dancers but it was CROWDED as can be. I started to feel claustrophobic in the main room so we went outside. Music was not as good outside but we found a place to sit and it was nice. I think VIP/Table is probably the way to go for this club but we did not splurge this time. We only stayed an 1-1 1/2 or so before I was ready to tap out.. just too crowded. I was tired from driving to Vegas all day and wanted to save my energy for Rehab the next morning. Like I said, I am sure the experience would be different had I not been so tired and had we gotten a table. I wouldn't be too excited to go back though ... its just too crowded.
I had just turned 21, so I don't recall entirely what was going on. . But I had quite a wonderful time.. . There's a nice inside area with dancing/dj etc. and a chill outside area where you can get fresh air by the pool.. . Highly recommend it!
I love Marquee especially Marquee Monday! The best venue, DJ's, bartenders, & free drinks! I always end up having the best of time here and end up being disappointed when I go to other clubs on the strip.
I never EVER have a great experience in Marquee every time i go. Maybe it's the fact that they let in anyone for free. or their promoters are thirsty to hit their numbers. . . Overly crowded with douchefucks. No room to walk anywhere. It felt like a cattle ranch. Annoying douche bags awkwardly pushing and shoving around on the dance floors. Flailing their limbs around spilling their drinks on people probably on purpose because their life had no purpose.  . . Marquee somehow tends to book top headliners. but my friends and I left way before the headlining DJ came on. . . AVOID at all cost.
One of my worst experiences at a club, not just in Vegas. I've been to Marquee a couple of times now, and every time just awful. Maybe Marquee was popping, like 3 years ago, but not now. . . They let just about anyone in now, no cover charge with great DJs headlining. How they get these DJs? I have no idea. . . Douchebags flailing their arms and fisting the air like no other. You may just end up with a concussion after a night out at Marquee. Ratchets are sloppy drunks, staggering around trying to look sexy and dance. LOL, they seriously just like a ragdoll. Hot. . . Last time I got kicked out being too drunk. Um okay, why not kick out the douchelords about to knock someone out with their killer dance moves or the sloppy drunk ratchets who look like they're about to fall asleep?  . . No thanks, I'd rather wait in a line for Hakkasan, or just wait for the new Drais club.
One of my fave clubs in Vegas.  They always have great DJs performing.  Gets mega crowded but you can always hang around the pool area if you want more room and a place to breathe.
Marquee has really improved, though I'm sad they took the dome down because it was super freezing on Monday night. Really great wait staff and busser guys. Security is really awesome if you have a table, I slipped him a few bucks and everytime guys were bothering us, he would do the thumbs up sign (as if to ask if I was okay) and check if he needed to remove some douchebags. We had a table outside but I slipped some people some cash and got us moved inside as soon as one freed up. While we were outside, they got us towels for us to wrap around ourselves which was nice since they also got rid of the heaters. Our table inside was nice and we had a ledge to dance on. Bottles were buy 1 get 1 so we got 2 of vodka and ended up giving another table half a bottle since we were too wasted and it was 3AM so we really weren't going to finish it. Made lots of friends with our table neighbors.
