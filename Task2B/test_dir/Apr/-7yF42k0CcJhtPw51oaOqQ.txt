One of the worst hotel experiences. I was placed in a room one floor below the smoking floor. The ventilation systems are connected, so the entire room smelled like smoke. Also, when I checked in, there was left over food in the fridge that was covered in mold. . When I spoke to the management, they refused to move me to another room because of the smoke filled room. Horrible service and a really disgusting room.. Will never go back
ok seriously this place sucks,might as well throw your money on the ground and burn it. I swear its gonna come out one day that all these casinos had more then an edge in their favor. the hotel is grand but like all casinos they have lost the old school service. I practically have to beg for a meal or a comp and frankly i'm sick of that bs. bring back the goodfellas they knew how to at least give you a feeling that you're money wasn't spent completely in vain. Just another example of over priced,under serviced and overall bad value for money spent or risked...welcome to the vegas facadeafarce....
Just GORGEOUS!!!  I though the service was excellent, the hotel itself immaculate, awesome restaurants and clubs within the facility.  The gym and spa were well kept and beautiful.  The decor was SOO cool, live butterfly room, fish pond with fish cam.  That was funny.  Obvi it's known for its fountain shows which were very cool.  I think I almost saw most of them... well maybe not true but I didn't see any repeats! Did not do much gambling though but who cares!!!. . If you have the money I thought it was beautiful and a great location on the strip
Although I am an avid Bellagio Hotel stayer, I must say, their service has gone lower with each stay.. . Pros:. While it's still amongst my top favorite places to stay, there are arising issues. The rooms are impeccable! The hotels have soft beds, spacious bathrooms, and newly renovated! Location is great! Pretty centrally located. Decent amount of restaurants. Great Walk through garden! Awesome poker room!! Amongst my top 3 in Las Vegas! Pretty good shopping stores: LV, Chanel, Hermes etc. I also like how there is security at the elevators checking keys. Safety first (:. . Cons:. A complaint I have is with billing. EVERY single time I have stayed here, the bill has been wrong. I've seen double resort fees per day ( meaning- instead of $25/day for resort fees I am accidently charged $50/day), food credit is always forgotten to be taken off, and I've even seen double the tax then what it should be. The problem really lies when once you've fixed the problem at the front desk and head home... you see your credit card statement- THERE IT IS AGAIN! Very annoying to call billing to fix  over the phone since phone waits take forever! Majority of the time they are accommodating and professional, but not always. Also, lines are long, but it's not too bad. Staff overall are pretty good and usually try to fix problems quickly. . . I do recommend this hotel and will be staying again- just check your bill statements!
Just had a fantastic experience atBellagio. We took advantage of a pretty sweet email promotion and ended up with a room that was double the size of our last stay for a rate we had never seen that low. . . We love Bellagio for several reasons, and they all showed themselves during this recent stay: . . 1) Breakfast buffet, which is the BEST breakfast buffet I've ever seen, is only $18.99. That is one of the best-kept secrets on the strip. Even at Bellagio, you're going to pay at least $18 for a decent roll at Yellowtail. . . 2) The game floor is simply organized and very comfortable. during our entire weekend, we only heard "insanely fat screaming craps winning guy" one time. The rest of the time was chill, because honestly most Bellagio guests could not possibly care any less about losing money.. . 3) Outstanding rooms. Bellagio is the best bang for your buck. At the end of a long, stinky day in Vegas, it's so wonderful to see that stone walk-in shower, and, this is one of the few Vegas hotels I've enjoyed where the climate control actually works right.. . 4) Service. From the front desk to the towel girls at the pool, Bellagio does service well. It's a travesty there are idiots on this Web site that would rate this place one star because he couldn't get his stupid handbag charged to his room bill. It's really, really sad. But in good news, attention to detail is NOTICED. Look at the pic of what they gave my baby, for example. Cute!. . With so many awesome hotels on the strip, it's very tempting to pick a new one each visit. Bellagio, though, is one I definitely wouldn't mind repeating!
Awesome hotel, great shows and great restaurants. The fountains out front are really nice and something you should make time for.
I'm torn.  If the Bellagio weren't in Las Vegas, or if it didn't position itself as a luxury hotel, I would definitely give it more stars.  However, precisely because the hype raised my expectations, I was a little disappointed.. . Check-in was pleasant.  The lobby is certainly a knockout!  However, I can't understand why they have a separate line for each check-in clerk, instead of a single line.  It's well-known that separate lines cause more anxiety and make people feel resentful when someone who arrived after them is helped first.. . The room was attractive and comfortable.  However, just two weeks earlier, I stayed in a DoubleTree, and the room at the Bellagio was not much better; in fact, in some ways, it was worse:  (1)  There was no place near the desk to plug in a laptop.  Yes, there was one outlet with two plugs, but they were already taken up by the wifi and a lamp.  (2)  The lighting was dim, with a particularly dark spot between the bed and the TV.  (3) The bed at the DoubleTree was softer.  (4)  My bed sloped slightly; the upper right corner was noticeably lower than the rest.  (5) There was Kleenex only in the bathroom, and it was cheap, undersized, and rough.  (6)  I couldn't reset the time on the alarm clock, which was running 53 minutes slow throughout my stay.. . The extra-deep bathtub was wonderful, though.  And the shower was attractive and larger than in the ordinary hotel (though I've had larger showers in Las Vegas).. . The water show is fun and over-the-top.  But, of course, you don't have to be staying at the Bellagio to watch it.. . All told, I'm glad I gave the Bellagio a try, and I definitely did enjoy the experience, but I think you could do better in Las Vegas for the same price.
Loved it. Was tired when we arrived so we relaxed in our room & ordered room service - which was delicious.  After resting we got out and explored, no complaints at all everything was beautiful, service was superb, all in hotel restaurants were fantastic. Prime Steakhouse, was great views from outside were perfect, best servers in the world, with melt in your mouth steak. Yellowtail, a cool hip vibe- try the popping crab roll for fun & poprocks. Buffet for breakfast was a dream come true, avoid long line and walk to the right ask to be sat in the bar. Our room overlooking the fountains, wonderful 26th floor offers excellent views. Will go again and stay here, can't imagine staying anywhere else! If price is no object consider a private Villa with your own pool.
I love the Bellagio! I stay here every year for a week-long work conference, and look forward to it all year. When I come out on vacation and stay with friends, I always end up here for a drink, or to play a little Blackjack.. or even walk through the flower display.. . The Bellagio hotel has more people staying the night every night than the total population of the town I grew up in. Seriously. It's a great place to sit and people watch (I recommend one of the comfy chairs by Jean Philippe's Patisserie.) The fountains are a must see.. with shows running on a regular schedule to a changing music selection.. . Bellagio.. it's the definition of Vegas!
This hotel is in a good location on the Las Vegas strip. I stay here maybe every other month. It is overpriced in my opinion but that is what you get for staying in Las Vegas. The bathrooms are great with a tube an shower, seep rate toilet room, an his/her sinks. My favorite part of this hotel is having a view of the water show. I never get tired of it!
Very disappointed with the bar next to the sports book! Trying to watch the Dodger game and the bartender is telling me that other games have priority! Really?! Hockey and lacrosse? The game is nowhere to be seen on any TV and I placed my bet here and was hoping to watch the game. Totally ridiculous! There are multiple baseball games being shown and the bartender is telling me there is only one baseball game being shown. I'm staying here and my boyfriend and I have been gambling and spending money here. Very disappointed!
Ok so experience in this hotel I will say exceeded expectation. I landed I'm Vegas early and I went to the check I'm desk expecting to drop off my bags because usually at 10am they are still prepping the room. But I got lucky because they had a room all ready and they accommodated when I asked high as possible and gave me the 26th floor. So I was already in a good mood. Bathroom was clean and room was spacious. So it was nice and in the evening my friends arrived and a parties like ore partied (no one called complaint on us unlike they do in encore). We were loud and blasting music and drinking heavily. No noise complaint.  It was also nice how  prompt they were when we asked for towels. Even calling in to make sure we got our towels. Now that's service. Then again bellagio in the MGM mirage family which is always a good group when staying in Vegas or anywhere that MGM mirage has hotels.
I don't know, you know?. . For a hotel that says that they are luxurious, the only luxury I saw was the ultra deep bath tubs (WIIIIN btw!!) - the beds were pretty much what you get in hotels, the pillows the same. The sheets weren't high thread count at all, my bed at home has higher thread count.. . Room service happened daily unless you specified otherwise - some days we had chocolates on our pillows, other days we didn't. I guess it was up to the feelings of the room service people.. . Just be aware though, if you are going to spend extra for a fountain view room that you'll be listening and being kept awake by the thunderous noise they make all the way till midnight. It's a we bit like having a cannon go of in your room, to be honest. And why you have to pay extra for that noise I really don't know.. . The TV!! Oh good gods, the TV. It was atrocious. My best friend was sick so we decided to spend one night in bed watching crappy shows and eating room service. We turned on the TV to find that whatever crap channel was trying to show, kept pixelating and freezing. We advised the front desk of this and was told that there was nothing to be done. . . And what the hell is it with the channels available? More than half were in another language and the few that were english were useless. Free to air TV has better offerings but unfortunately we couldn't get that either.. . All in all though? If you want to spend this much on a hotel room, find somewhere that is actually luxurious and not just upmarket in the bathrooms.. . And the walk to get to your room. If you're in heels you might want to think of slipping them off during your trek to get through the casino to find the elevators to rooms. Also don't forget to have yourkeycard ready for the man standing at the bottom of the elevators or you might not be allowed up.
Don't know that I ever want to stay anywhere else. Slots aren't very loose and the tables are quite expensive. But the botanical gardens are beautiful, the decor is classy and the entire property is spotless. Food was always good but on the pricey side. The service is unparalleled. I felt spoiled the entire stay! Get a penthouse suite if you can. It's totally worth it! I splurged for a cabana for a day and that was worth it as well.
The hotel is beautifully decorated, and very clean.  Spacious rooms and friendly, fast room service.  The smoked salmon eggs benedict is fantastic.  I love the VIP lounge with the snacks and drinks.  Always the most friendly staff.  The pool smells wonderful with all the beautiful flowers everywhere.  Lots of trees, so you can find a chair in the shade if you want one.  And the music is at a pleasant volume.  Fix was a great restaurant, but a little too pricey for the food you get.  Lily is a nice lounge and not too crowded when I was there.. Overall, always a wonderful experience!
If your looking for a WOW factor from Bellagio ? Well keep looking. This is just an over priced hotel with fancy name and over priced amenities. . . Room: There is nothing special about the room. Standard room with nothing special. If you overpaid for the room with the view then you'll at least get the fountain view. If not, you'll get the view of the... The freeway. . . Hotel: The hotel must have a horrible ventilation since the entire hotel is filled with cigarette fumes. You can't escape the smell you'll walk away smelling like the nasty smokers.  . . Pool:  Pool was small and over crowded. We couldn't even find a spot to lay down and had to wait an hour or so. Horrible experience. . . Service: It was mediocre at best. If you call the front desk, expect to get transferred and put on hold for 10 minutes or more. Service you would get is just OK and nothing special. . . Bellagio Buffet: MOST DISAPPOINTING BUFFET EVER !!!!  Over priced and seriously nothing special to even write about it. Don't waste your money here. If you have kids, they'll have the adult rate, even at age 4. . . Overall, we ended up checking out early to switch hotel. We couldn't stand it here anymore after 2 nights. . . I hope this helps.
Gorgeous place to stay!! Great food all throughout the quarters. The Spa is one of the best I've ever experienced. Simply put "amazing"
This place is defiantly upscale!! The hotel is amazing!! Clean, attractive, lots to see and do within. This is my 3rd visit to Vegas and staying at the Bellagio was on my bucket list. However, I would never stay here again. The staff is rude (extremely) rude. You pay a 25$ per day resort fee which is to cover the cost of free wi-fi, pool usage, and the use of the fitness center.  Well only thing I used was the internet and that was maybe for an hour or less, the only reason I used it was because I felt like I would get some use of my money. I have HotSpot on my cell so there was no need for me to really connect to their "free" wi-fi".  In my opinion for the price paid to stay here per night those amenities should automatically be included.  If you have lots of money and it shows then stay here. If you're middle class and just want to come to Vegas and have a great time without the rude staff, extra charges and tight machines then pick another hotel. I've stayed at Planet Hollywood and MGM here in Vegas and I have not one complaint.
Wife and I headed to Vegas for a three-night stay at the Bellagio over Easter weekend. We opted to splurge a bit for a premium fountain view room, and...wow. Check out my picture for the view from our room (room number 27052, if you're curious).  This was one of the highlights of the trip for us -- watching the fountain show with the music synced to it on our TV in the room never got old.. . Anyway, we were both Vegas first-timers, and from a location standpoint the Bellagio is pretty much perfect. Take note that the strip is much longer and more spread out than you'd think, so no matter where you stay there will be quite a bit of walking involved. That said, the Bellagio is in the center of it all.. . The property is beautiful (did I mention the fountains?), the room was gorgeous and spacious, and all staff we encountered were top-notch.  Special shout-out to our server at the bottomless mimosa brunch buffet...suffice to say, we had a little difficulty staggering back to our room at 9:30 am because she never let our glasses get empty.  . . Walking through the hotel lobby will usually be a chore because of the huge crowds gawking at the glass sculpture on the ceiling, but that was fine with us.. . Note to gamblers: play blackjack at the Bellagio! Blackjacks still play 3:2 (unlike 6:5 at lots of other Vegas casinos) and I was able to find $10-$15 tables at all times with relative ease.  Dealers were generally friendly.. . We ate the Prime Restaurant -- fantastic. See my separate review for that. We also ate at the buffet -- pretty good. See my separate review for that as well.. . Our only issue was the pool. Plenty of other reviewers indicated that there are always plenty of chairs at the pool...we didn't think so.  I hate to dock a full star for this, but we were planning on spending a good portion of a day poolside, and weren't able do that because the only available chairs were in the shade.. . Overall, it was a terrific stay, and we would most definitely stay there again.
I loved watching the water show! It's free, and entertaining. They do it every 15min or every 1/2 hour, depending on the day/time. The fountains are coordinated with music, it's cool to watch. If you are in Vegas and haven't seen it before, definitely stop by and check it out.
Wow wow wow! This place is breath taking. Oozes class and opulence. . . We had macaroons at the French patisserie, toured the lobby to see the handmade glass ceiling installation and butterfly gardens. . . We then had a bet or two at the casino then had dinner in Noodle restaurant in the Bellagio on our winnings. . . I would love to come back to Vegas just to stay here.
For a premier hotel the service better at a Motel Six. I've never been so disappointed in a hotel. The service was terrible and the staff was rude. Even the rooms were not as nice as the Signature, for half the price. I booked the Bellagio for my son's wedding. Going for coffee in the morning was a ride on the tram to a hotel a few miles away to Starbuck's, Bellagio's coffee bar wasn't too good. Four coffees and four danish, hands full I walk up to my towers elevator and a guard growls at me for my key card. "It's in my pocket. You have a choice. You can either hold this tray or fish it out of my pocket yourself." Then comes the, "Well, I guess I don't need to see it this time."  Every drink girl in the casino was going on break or getting off her shift when she passed by and I tip well. Up the strip I had one server bring me a drink every time she came by without being asked, that's what a $20 will do. Needless to say, I stay up the strip from now on.
