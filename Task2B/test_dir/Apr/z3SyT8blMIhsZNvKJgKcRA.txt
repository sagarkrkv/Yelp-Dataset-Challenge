Nous avions reserve dans cet hotel pour sa reputation... et nous avons ete tres decu, outre le fait que l'alarme incendie sonne tout les matins a 10h (pour la tester) le reste de l'hotel n'etais pas a la hauteur. Impossible de trouver quelque part ou manger tard, et notre chambre etait sale (tache enorme sur la moquette etc...) . . Bref la prochaine fois je ne retournerais certainement pas dans cet hotel !
One of my favorite casinos. Home of my favorite buffet and other restaurants I enjoy dining at. Nike town is also located here. Huge two story of nike products. H & M which 3 stories. . Infamous forum shops filled with tourist and locals. Huge statues all over the casino. I bring my family here all time because my son loves the large aquarium next to Cheesecake Factory. He'll just sit there and play with the fishes for hours. . . Can't come here without thinking of The Hangover movie lol. check it out. It has a lot to offer for the whole family.
Stayed here for a work conference and had a nice time overall. We were upgraded to a better suite that overlooked the Bellagio fountains which was nice. The downside was that we got to hear all the road noise, but the A/C muffled those sounds.. . Staff is super friendly and accommodating to your needs - just ask and they will see what they can do. The room itself was spacious and comfortable with a few different seating/lounge areas to relax.. . The hotel offers so many restaurant and shopping options that you don't have to leave. This is nice when you want to get out and see things but not in the masses out on the Strip.. . The gym was an extra $25 per day, which I skipped. I took a look around and thought I could put the money to better use elsewhere, and ran outside instead. The pool was a great place to relax and get some sun, and relative peace and quiet.. . You can't go wrong here. A solid choice.
Stayed at the hotel with my husband for a Christmas week. Nice clean hotel. Very pretty pool area. We stayed at the Palace Tower with a pretty cool view at the pool area. Big bathroom with 2 sinks, huge mirror, jacuzzi , big glass shower and toilet in the separate room. Big room with king bad, bar, sitting area with sofa and chairs. Hallway with big closet, and special area for girls to get ready (loved it!). Totally worth the money.. . What I didnt like was:. -too many families with kids (kids and Vegas doesnt go together). -hard to find smth to eat at 4am within the hotel  (come on, its Vegas!!!)
Upon arrival, we were greeted by a robotic-monotonic valet guy and front desk worker. Weird!. . We had reserved a room with a view and two beds. Instead, we received a stinky motel-looking room in the Roman tower because we checked in at 1a. Accordingly to the robot workers, rooms are not guaranteed and based upon availability. I'm a faithful guest of The Venetian and Palazzo, but had heard great things about Caeser's Hotel, so I ventured out this weekend! . . What a terrible mistake...These people don't believe in customer service! I'm appalled! I will not be returning to this hotel! My first and last time here.
Always love staying at  Caesars Palace because:. . -All the rooms are updated and very nice with plenty of room.. -Room views are really nice either being the pool or strip.. -Check in is very fast. -Plenty of services available on site. . Bad:. Valet sucks
I do not recommend this hotel at all. I frequent Las Vegas a lot and have never had such a horrible experience. . . The staff is ridiculously rude especially the Valet. They told me the lot was full and then took the car behind me. Turns out he is a diamond card member just as I am. When I confronted the man he backtracked.. . Our room had to be switched once and the room we stayed in was like a Motel 6. The TV didn't work and that was after we discovered we had no remote. . . Do not stay here! Any other Caesars location is better.
After visiting Vegas many times in the past few years, I have decided to book a room at Caesars Palaces. . . It was pricey, since we stayed during spring break week. As a matter of fact, their room is always pricey. We stayed in the Octavius Tower.. . Since there aren't a lot of Caesars Palace room tour on YouTube, I've decided to take matter into my own hand and recorded a full room tour for you guys to check out. So here's the video of the Octavius Luxury Tower room.. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiS8qBRL6kM. . The room is very spacious and looks pretty high-end.. . The bathroom has 2 fancy sinks and a very larger shower. It also has a big tub with few jet nozzles. and of course a little tv in the bathroom when you wash your face or put on make-up.. . I've also recorded a Full Tour of the Pool area. So here's the full video on that:. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCxBgc0ATfk. . There are a total of 5 pools that I counted when I was there. Looks pretty neat. I don't think they have a hot Jacuzzi/spa. I do have to say that the pool is heated.. . The only thing I didn't like is that they now tack on a mandatory Resort fee of $25. I think they started adding resort fee last year in February. . . So if you guys are planning on staying at Casesars Palace and want to see what the room looks like before you guys book. Here's a full tour of Octavius Tower Room:. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiS8qBRL6kM
OK, I will admit, I am not a big fan of Vegas. The smoking and gambling is not my scene and I find most of the hotels over the top and kitschy. I do like the shows and love the restaurants. . . One of the hotels that I have always enjoyed coming to is Caesars. It is kitschy too but maybe it is because it was one of the hotels that left an impression on me when I came here when I was much younger and it makes me nostalgic. Also helps that not everything smells of smoke.
DO NOT LET THEM PUT YOU IN ROMAN TOWER!  Unless, of course, sleeping in an ashtray sounds appealing.  . . The rooms are tired.  Not clean... and overwhelmingly smell of cigarette smoke.. . I am so sad of this pathetic experience... I anticipated I would like Ceasars.
We had a king room in the Palace Tower.  Very nice diggs!   Super clean and nicely appointed.  We were pleasantly surprised to find a swimming pool sized jacuzzi tub in our room.  That's a good thing because with something like 4-5 pools that Caesars has, I didn't spot a jacuzzi anywhere. . . The bed was awesome.  Very high quality linens and fluffy pillows made for an awesome nights sleep.  (Well that coupled with the fact that I was up waayy past my bedtime every night we were here)!   Housekeeping was very nice and made quick work of cleaning the room.  We had to wait for about 15 minutes for her to finish.  . . This place is spendy.  There is no two ways to say it.  $8.00 for a Coors Light by the pool.  Cocktails were like $16.00.   Never in my life have I paid $16 for a chicken quesadilla.  And for the close to $300 a night, I probably wouldn't return.  . . Harrahs Entertainment has a really good deal for its Buffets... $49 gets you a 24 hour pass to ALL of its buffets.  That's right- you can dine at Caesars for Breakfast, Paris for brunch, Flamingo for Lunch, Rio for Dinner and Ballys for a late night snack...
Just spent few days at this hotel. Room was not the cleanest one and the bed was not that comfortable. Beer py the pool 11$ mojito like 16$ but very delicious french fries 8$ . Pools were awesome. The casino space felt very small compared to other hotels. I love slot machines but had not much to choose from. If you want to stay here be readdy to spend a lot of extra $. Dont even try to open mini fridge in the room cause ull be charged for it fast. Staff was very nice.
Attended the show for Elton John....great place!  I don't think anyone could sound bad in the Coliseum.  This place is beautiful.  Easy to get into and comfortable seating.
Ok, I just reviewed Paris but I can't forget to review Caesar's.. Here we go, you guys have to definitely sign up for total rewards because from all the rewards on the strip, Ceasars entertainment is the most generous . I've had M Life spent thousands of dollars on hotels and shows and I still don't get comped like I do at Ceasars. I finally made it to Pearl at M Life stayed on all the properties, ate all the buffets, went to all the cirque soleil shows and I still don't get anything for free. But at Ceasars just the first couple of months I was already comped the basic rooms. Now a diamond holder, I get free show tickets like rod stewart, celine..and the new britney spears show. They always put us in augustus tower beautiful rooms with view of the strip. Vip valet, vip lounge for easy check in, text messages when your room is ready..they treat you like a whale even though i'm far from throwing a hundred grand a hand. Thank you Ceasars ent. Last word of advice don't book the roman towers it will turn you off caesars palace.
A few friends got together and arranged a getaway for my birthday since I hadn't really done anything in a while to celebrate. . . One of my friends is a high roller out in Vegas and is either Diamond or Platinum so she gave us her hookups for a free room here in the Octavius tower which is a new addition to this property.. . We were arriving late and not able to meet her to get the keys so she left them at the front desk under our name. Should have been easy peasy but when we arrived to pick them up they first wanted our IDs - no big deal so we handed them over. Then they noticed we weren't really anything special and didn't have a Total Rewards card so they wanted to give us a regular room. Um no. So we asked for a manager. The manager gave us some issues so we finally called my friend and she called them, gave them hell and magically we had keys and an extra night to spend, plus some dining credits. Woohoo!. . The room itself was fabulous and so was the wait staff etc. Beyond the checkin issues, we really loved having the luxury of the upscale room. The beds were AMAZING!! I had the best sleep of my life and that's saying a lot because I can hardly sleep in hotels but this was just fabulous. . . We also had an awesome bathroom with dual sinks so that we could both have our own space and sink areas and plenty of room for the both of us to just indulge and enjoy vegas.
This place is awesome.. . No tiger in my bathroom this trip, but fun fun fun.. . I stayed here for 3 nights and had a blast.  The service is amazing and the location could not be better.  My room in the Augustus tower was very nice with everything you could want.  I had to wait for the buffet however it was just amazing.  The mushroom truffle soup was to die for.. . If you are going to Vegas, try to stay here, you will be very happy.
I usually stay at the Paris which I love but decided to try Caesars. I had a very large room in the Augustus tower. It had very comfy king size bed. Lots of room to spread out and great view of the Bellagio fountain show. . Water pressure was great in shower and the towels were right size and fluffiness for my taste.  I am hardly in my room so as long as bed is good and shower good I am happy! I don't like people in my room so I always skip maid service. . Check in was easy in diamond line and lady very nice.
Ok so the suite was nice with the jetted tub, etc.  My main issues was with billing and customer service.  Since the billing issue so overshadows the stay I would be careful to stay here again.. . Let me explain and you decide:. . I left my debit for the deposit on the room...3 days later total was charged on my debit card! What makes this worse is that the room was already paid for so they charged for the room twice.  It took 4 days to get my money back from Caesars.  Learn from my mistake and use a credit card for your deposit card for your room.  Luckily I had the cash to cover it in my account or I would have been broke for 4 days waiting for my refund from here.
I absolutely love this place!! The shops inside the Palace are the best! There is literally every type of place to shop at from super pricey and chic to cheap and fun! They have great restaurant options which I love!! There is never a dull moment when I go. . . The scenery is great to check out and the casino is always poppin!!
Not a bad hotel to stay in at all. Lovely rooms.  But make sure you ask for a tower that's connected/close to the front desk or else you'll be walking forever to your room.
