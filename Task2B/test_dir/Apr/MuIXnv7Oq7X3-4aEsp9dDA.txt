I was not impressed with the hype about the food.  It was too many flavors and combinations.  The mashed potatoes don't taste like what I would expect with my filet.  Nothing is substantial  A bit of this and that  Still hungry at the end of the mea  Duck was tore and had to go back.  Spareribs  the specialty , too fatty and not enough mea.  Went back, too.  Pricey and just not as good as the hype they're giving out.
They have a great cocktail list, and offer affordable bar snacks. From rosemary roasted nuts to assorted olives, plenty to choose from. Oh, and order the Original Chopped Salad. You won't be sorry. One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale.
A classy place where everyone is comfortable.  Great service and lots of cocktails with creative variations without loosing how to make it really good.  The food is even better.  Filet was ordered less than Med rare and that is exactly how I got it.  My wife ordered the braised short rib that was out if this world.  $90 for two entrees and three drinks but totally worth it!!
Wow.  I was so impressed with this place!  Came here for a date night and it delivered.  The atmosphere was romantic and the service impeccable.  Our server let us sample some barrel cocktails, which was helpful because they were strong and I didn't end up buying a drink I wouldn't have been able to drink.  They give you free bread.  Not a big deal you say?  Maybe not, but I've been to a lot of nice restaurants that make you starve while waiting for your food, so it is nice when a place doesn't nickel and dime you into starvation.  Am I right?  So we had the fondue for an appetizer and some happy hour cocktails. If you like Swiss cheese, you'd dig the fondue, otherwise maybe choose something else.  The Cherry tart pinot noir is fab IMHO.  So I bit the bullet and ordered the chopped salad.  OMG.... nosh-a-licious!  It was really, really good.  The mixture of textures and flavors was so satisfying and, I'm not going to lie, I don't get all that jazzed up over salads usually.  My husband had the special - the fillet burger - and I'm pretty sure his eyes rolled into the back of his head in delight.  I believe the exact quote was, "This is the best burger I've ever had".  I have seen how many burgers this man has eaten, and trust me, that is high praise.  Service - five stars!  Food - five stars!  Drinks - Five again.  Would come back here happily.
Absolutely love this place! Came here on a date on a Saturday night in December, and the place was packed. With a reservation, you shouldn't have much of an issue though. Just a heads up, as with most places located in Downtown Scottsdale, you may have a tough time finding parking depending on the day/time you stop by. Anyhow, the place is adorable. It's a decently-sized restaurant with a lot of character. It's modestly decorated and the ambiance is pleasant.. . My date ordered a gin cocktail, which was absolutely amazing! Taste was perfect and not too much flavoring to overcome the gin, which is always nice. . . For dinner, I ordered the scallops and he ordered the prime rib. I didn't try any of his, but from what he said it was delicious. The scallops I had were the best I've ever tasted in my entire life. They didn't have an overpoweringly fishy smell or taste and literally melted in my mouth. Absolutely delicious! The only thing I would have to complain about would be that the greens the scallops are served with are rather tough, hard to cut through, and hard to chew. For dessert, we shared the bananas foster dish that they have, and it was pretty delicious as well. . . Overall, I would absolutely return!
All the staff, from the front host, to the bartender on break, and to the waiter who came over to talk to us but we weren't even his customers - everything was fabby.  Thank you Thomas, at the bar, who gave impeccable service with a smile (I think he chews Orbit Gum).  Bacon Popcorn was terribly good, and the mini fondue was to DIE for!  . . and, BTW, thanks to ALL who treated my daughterso outstandingly and made her laugh the whole time!
Sat at the bar for a cocktail and late night snack. Had the Citi-Zen which was a drink with a stick of rock candy! Genius! Also had the pita plate which was a nice helping for about $8 and the beef skewers. Just ok, expensive and you don't get much. Nice atmosphere and service. Food took a while to come out which I found weird considering what we ordered. Overall, good experience. Not sure I will be back though.
As mentioned in almost every other review, they nailed it. Took my fiance out for a nice Monday dinner in old town and wound up here. Harrison greeted us and made easy conversation as he walked us to our table. Cool guy.. AJ was out server and was pretty busy. He was back and forth at his tables spending a little time at each one and keeping his head on a swivel. Having been in the industry for years I'm a little critical. . Fondue: great. Came with some bread, little sausage links and apples. Bomb!. Filet is laid over mashed potatoes. Bomb!. Lady had the chopped salad that everyone raves about. According to her...bomb.. The only thing that outdid the food was the service. Shoutout to AJ and Harrison. We'll be back.
Great service and drinks.  The Midwest Manhattan is outstanding. The food was delicious albeit a little salty. My husbands filet was generous and perfectly cooked. It was absolutely delicious. I had the scallops. Only three atop an extremely rich buttery creamed corn base.  The chopped salad is good but there's not much lettuce to it. Just goodies  - like a lot of currents.  I sampled our friends spare rib- very good and tender.
Lamb burger was terrible.  Bread was too hard, the lamb burger patty lacked flavor and all you taste is salt.  It came with a home made ketchup which was too sweet.  Fries were great.  Good wine selection.  My colleague had the meatloaf and he thought that was excellent.
First time here while on business from Miami. Great service at the front door and even better service from Sam. Energetic, helpful and passionate about what he does. Took his suggestion on the Moscow mule cocktail, chopped salad, buttermilk chicken, and fudge brownie dessert. Definitely would recommend to anyone.
Good but not great food, drinks are 4 oz / $10 - tasty but disappointing, great atmosphere, trendy food, the chopped salad was good!!
I don't know what all the "talk" is about this restaurant, as we found it to be average plus! Really small martini glasses( tiny drinks), the grilled cheese was bland, the pork chop was bland, the chopped salad was very good, the Mac and cheese wasn't as good as out of the box, the filet mignon was very good! Really loud interior, super loud actually, boring bread basket, thought the PB &B dessert might save them as it sounded great, but it was only average as well! To many good restaurants to go back! RS
Just came for dessert but it was tasty! Cocoa chile bread pudding and some brownie madness dish. Both awesome. Drinks were great too -  had the Citi-zen and hot pink paloma (not hot pink btw). Lots of furniture moving out of dining area during peak evening hours was kind of loud/annoying and seemingly unnecessary but otherwise great service and fare. Ambiance on patio was ok.
We went to citizen public house last night because we were in the old Town Scottsdale area and wanted to try somewhere new. We found this place on Yelp, of course, and saw that it had stellar reviews.. . We got right in and were seated in the outdoor section and had AJ as our waiter. It was a fun atmosphere, well kept, and had a great appearance / decor. Our waiter was quick to give us recommendations when we were trying to decide between items, and was the first to tell us when he thought one thing was better than another. This is much appreciated, and as with other similar experiences, we've found the waiters who are willing to do so make excellent recommendations. . . Our food was prepared perfectly. I had the lamb burger, which was seasoned well and came with a side of fries. I also tried their seasonal cider which was good. They have a full bar and wine selections as well. The patio area had a nice view overlooking the street. The price level was fairly average for a popular restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale. . . My wife had the truffle grilled cheese, which she also enjoyed. For dessert we tried the brownie. It was a fudge brownie with chocolate chips and a scoop of ice cream on top, as well as, a caramel garnish. The only thing I would say that would make it better, was if the brownie was hot. Overall we had a good experience and I would be interested in coming back and trying other options on their menu.
Always a favorite spot when I'm in town. Meatloaf is one of the most unique dishes and boy is it a treat! Happy hour specials are solid. Service is top-notch. If you are in the area, don't hesitate to come by and every seat in the house is good!
The delicious cuisine and wonderful service of Citizens Public House draws a diverse crowd - older couples in classic clothing, young adults in jeans and caps, match.com dates (yeah, I can spot them from a mile away) looking snazzy and friends gathering for a casual meal.  In other words, citizens has wide appeal for all ages and all occasions. . . AJ was our waiter and was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. He recommended the chop salad (of course) and the scallops. My friend went surf and followed the scallop recommendation whereas I went turf and got the filet mignon. Both of our dishes were delicious.  The chopped salad was slightly unique and tasty but probably a little overrated at this point. . . The downside to this popular restaurant is the noise level. I was here at 8pm on a Sunday night when the restaurant wasn't packed and it was s. A little hard to hear my table met even though I have perfect hearing.
After choosing this place after it's great reviews, I decided to give it a try. Not gonna lie, I was a little let down by the menu choices, but what I had (crab cakes & chopped salad) was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! Definitely worth the bite! :)
My out of town friends decided to get a lil fancy schmancy and reserve the private room for din din. I've been to the restaurant area before but never to this private room. The scenery of this room pulled all stops with beautiful chandeliers, dim lighting, and even your private bar with your own private bartender. . For appetizers we ordered the fondue to share and it was the most creamiest, tastiest fondue ever made. Yes, I'm still craving it. I ordered the pan seared scallops which was cooked to perfection. We spent A long time enjoying the evening with our group and didn't feel rushed. . This place is a must for date night and must make reservations ahead. Everything was just fabulous.
What an AMAZING restaurant!. My wife and I recently went here on our wedding anniversary. We had no idea what a great experience this would be. From the very beginning we noticed how consistently attentive and friendly the staff was. Over the top!. Once we got to our patio table, we were greeted by our waiter, Sam. Sam had a way of talking and presenting the food we ordered that made everything feel like we were in for such an amazing treat... and he was right.. We ordered the chopped salad to share. It was the best we've ever had! We were in the middle of trying to figure out how it was made (so we could try to make it) when Sam came back to see how we liked it. We told him what we were doing and he helped us! Then he said, "Ill be right back with a surprise." When he returned he had a printed recipe card for the chopped salad which he gave to us. Who does that?!. I could go on and on about the details for the rest of the evening, but they all played out just like it started... AMAZING. Thanks for the great food and great memories. Even though this is a 5 hour drive for us, Citizen Public House is one of the main reasons we will go back to Scottsdale. Soon!
Been wanting to try this place for a bit now, and we were finally able to check it off the bookmark list.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in and sat (as requested) at a nice table outside. The decor and atmosphere was fun, eclectic, and welcoming.. . Our server stopped over within a minute or two and took our drink orders. After a little deliberation and a few well answered questions from our server, I ordered the truffle grilled cheese and he has the lamb burger. The truffle grilled cheese was extremely tasty. The onions on it were cooked perfectly and the truffle flavor was distinguishable, but not overwhelming on the other flavors!  The side salad had some delicious berries and cheese topped with a light balsamic that made a winning combo.. . Despite being relatively stuffed already, we just had to try the brownie dessert with caramel sauce.  The only things that could have made this delectable delight better - warm that baby up before topping it with the ice cream! It was however, devoured as it was, so obviously it wasn't a loss by any means.. . Our server was friendly and wonderful from start to finish - he made (good) recommendations, checked in regularly, and made us laugh.. . Overall: A. When we are back in the area, this is definitely on our "do again" list!
