This place is more like a glorified motel. Way north of the strip. Too inconvenient to get to any other casinos on the strip. I was not a big fan of the facilities. Our room seemed more like a motel room. The AC was too loud and we could not sleep first night. The hotel however, fixed the AC next day when we complained. They do not even have a fridge in the room. The staff in general is friendly. If you compare the casino this place is nowhere close to the other casinos on the strip in terms of class. If you are going to Vegas at least go to a decent one in the middle of the strip.  Even the Atlantic city casinos are 10 time better than Stratosphere. If all you want to use this hotel is for room stay then why not stay off the strip. You would never go to the casino to check out how it is or gamble here. Unless you are seriously on a very tight budget and want to "technically stay on the strip"...don't stay here!!
I recently stayed at the Stratosphere, about 2 weeks ago. I must say after reading the reviews on this place, I was a little reluctant in booking. I went ahead and kept my reservation, since I wanted to see the amazing view. Well it was worth it. The hotel room itself was nice! The renovated rooms really made me and my husband want to just stay in the rooms. But since you cant really do that in Vegas we had fun in the casino and hotel itself. I loved how the tower, mall, and casino where all in one place. . I did not like the LOCATION. It is on the END of the strip. We had to buy a cab every time we wanted to go to the main parts of the strip. But honestly its VEGAS.. so you have to be ready to walk anyway. . The worst part if i had to pick one is the LOCATION! it is literally next to the hood! so BEWARE.. but if your not scared like me... GO FOR IT!
Crooked dealings are happening here.  . . I checked in expecting to pay a $30 resort fee for two days, and they tried to charge me $92 at checkout.  I complained, and they said they would "waive" the fee.. . Because the balance was supposed to be zero, they didn't issue me a receipt.  After getting home, what do I see on my credit card?  You guessed it, $92.. . Now I have to waste an hour of my life to fight their charges.  . . Do not stay here. Save yourself the headache and pick a property that will not try to screw you over.. . The Casino is very smoky, and the local food is second rate.  One of the 3 rides on the tower was out of order, but they won't tell that you when you are buying your ticket. . . Did I say don't stay here?
We stayed here for 2 nights!!! Was initially impressed at the hotel because it looked clean and the room was decent! On top of that we were able to go up to the tower observation deck for free.. . On our 2nd day, we left our room around 11am to continue exploring the strip. We left the "please service" sign outside our door to alert the staff that our room needs tidying. We came back later that night at 130am and got the surprise of our life! The room wasn't cleaned  at all. We called the front desk and their only explanation is miscommunication. They asked me if i want it serviced then. Seriously at 130 am? If you guys have done your job and cared for your guest i wouldn't have to complain about this! Asked to talked to the manager and his only response is "I'm sorry. I will send towels as soon as i can!" 35 minutes later we had towels and were finally able to shower.  When paying the kind of money you do to stay at a resort such as this, you expect the details to be taken care of. Especially when there is an additional $17 a night resort fee.  Very disappointed, will not stay again.
I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Stratosphere and was a bit concerned about stayingafter reading all the negative reviews on Yelp and other web sites.   . . After reading many reviews on products and locations it seems most people lack perspective and objectivity or they have failed to do basic research, which is not the fault of the product, service, or place being reviewed.. . Some rebuttals to complaints I read about the Stratosphere:. . 1)  Resort Fee.  Almost all Casinos now charge a resort fee in Las Vegas.  15 bucks a night seems to be in the middle of the pack.  Services provided by that resort fee seemed reasonable.  Just figure it into the cost of a per-night stay instead of complaining about it.   Resort Fee is PER ROOM, not Per Person, as some have reported.. . 2) Distance from the Strip.  There are all types of online maps and guides to Las Vegas.  If you think the Stratosphere is too far from the strip then you didn't do any research before booking.   Yes Taxis cost money.  There are buses and the Monorail to ride, too.. . 3) Rudeness of staff.  If anything, the staff and guests at the Stratosphere were overly friendly to me and my family.   Smiles and pleasantries were handed out by all.. . 4) Room Cleanliness and Maid Service.   The room we were in was clean and the hotel maid service came in and changed out towels, vacuumed, and made the beds EVERY day.   Granted this is not  a 5-Star resort room, but I have spent far more for rooms very similar.   Someone recently noted the TV's did not have HD service.  The large flat screen TV in our room certainly had free HD programming.. . 5) Valet Service and Bell Desk.   FREE.  USE THEM.   If you think self-park or overflow parking are too far away, use the Valet and Bell Desk.    We got wonderful pleasant service from both.  We tipped modestly for the services and no staff member complained or held out his hand for more.  . . 6) Cost.  Holy cow!  With resort fees and a $5 upgrade we got a decent room for $85 a night averaged over three nights.  As I guy who travels a lot - you can't get a room as nice out in the middle of nowhere on the I-5 in Central California for that price.  It's a bargain.  Given that Stratosphere guests get free access to the Tower Observation decks - if you avail yourself of this - and take a few friends to the top, you have pretty much paid for the room.  My family and a few friends would have been out $180 out-of-pocket just for this.   . . 7)  Long walk to the pool.  It's a big place.  Did you want someone to carry you?  Ask for a room near the pool.   My big complaint about all Casino pools in Vegas is their limited hours.. . 8) Noise.  You are in Las Vegas.   It's a noisy place.   Sometimes I could hear the people in the adjoining rooms or hallways.  Name a hotel where that can't happen.  . . 9)  Shops.  The selection of shops and restaurants in the Stratosphere seemed pretty decent to me.. . 10) Gambling.  Seemed pretty standard to me.    They even had gaming tables with scantily clad and attractive female dealers, if you are into that. . . 11)  Buffet.  I'm not a big buffet fan, but we ate there.  Food was good, not stellar, but good.  $20 per adult is about standard these days (get over it - the meal bargain loss-leaders are no more in LV).  We went and applied for a casino card and got a 25% discount on our meal.  The wait staff was very pleasant  and even though we (five of us) dawdled at our table for over three hours on a Friday night, no one on staff complained or tried to rush us out.   Selection and quality was on par with most buffets at casinos I've been to.  . . 12)  In room coffee maker.  The room we stayed in had no coffee-maker.   That seems like a trivial complaint, but several people have made it.   I've used one in the last decade maybe once.    McDonald's in the Stratosphere was giving away small coffees when we were there.   Note the rooms do not have any mini-bars, microwaves or refrigerators, either.   I consider this a plus, personally.   The bell-hop gladly loaded our large ice-filled cooler onto his cart and brought it up to the room.   And I refilled the cooler with ice from the hotel ice maker without objection or complaint from the hotel staff.. . The last time we stayed at the Las Vegas Cosmopolitan they initially refused to let us have an ice-filled cooler in the room,  brought up a non-functional mini-fridge, and finally cleared out the mini-bar so that we could store my daughter's Insulin in there.    They wanted to charge for the extra fridge and cleaning out the mini-bar, too.    . . All-in-all our stay at the Stratosphere was positive, pleasant, and inexpensive.   We got friendly service and a decent room at a reasonable price.
I just got back from Las Vegas last weekend (April 3rd-6th) and stayed at the Stratosphere. Biggest mistake ever! It was SOOOOO far away from the strip. You will be paying about $15 per cab ride, $49 if you take a town car to get back to your hotel. Guess what? That adds up to staying on the strip at the Bellagio or Venetian. I also booked through priceline and they said I could upgrade. I thought awesome, maybe a suite or a great room. Um not so much. I paid $60 for 3 nights and we ended up with a "Normal" room. This was after 3 upgrades apparently. It was a normal hotel room with 2 queen beds and a bathroom. I could only imagine what tuna can room we would have had.  The "strip view" lol it is a really shady neighborhood where the hotel is. We ended up with a select room that had separate elevators and free tower passes. Also the "stores" in the hotel, not so great. A very cheap mall. . . Positives were the valet guys were great and free parking. Also jumping off the building was awesome, other than that, no thank you. We tried the lounge on the top floor. The service was horrible. . . I would rather pay more money and stay someplace better.
The hotel sits at the end of the strip, which is nice because you can view the strip and city from the Stratosphere Tower.  The Stratosphere Tower was the high point of our vacation.  Viewing the Las Vegas Blvd  at night after a fun-filled day was peaceful and relaxing.  The staff in the Tower was friendly and helpful.. . The hotel staff was not as friendly as the staff in the  Tower was. But with that said,  The hotel has a Starbucks which was a nice way start our day, but pricey. . We didn't play at the Casino at all so I can't review it.  I can add that it was well vented and we didn't suffer from the smokers, as we walked through it daily to get to our other Casino destinations.. . The hotel is old but is in the process of being renovated. Our upgraded room was clean with the exception of the bathroom floor.  I'm not sure how they clean it between guest but I got athlete's foot from the dirty floor.  Our room was on the 12th floor and we had a great view of the mountains. We came back to our rooms nightly and found the clean and ready for us.
Just spent 4 nights here the room was nice we were asked if we would like to be upgraded for a additional fee of $25 a night and ended up paying OVER $200 additional! So don't be taking in like we were thinking it's a great deal! I did enjoy the suite ;) Just not the prices! And skip the Buffet it's gross but Roxys Dinner has excellent food!
My husband and I came here to eat while on vacation and it was nothing short of spectacular!!!! The view is AMAZING. I don't know all about the rides though lol
I've stayed twice at this hotel, the hotel is great for the price. The only crappy thing is how far away it is from the main strip. Oh and one night I was getting ready to see Cher, I was naked in my room and housekeeping walked in with out knocking! I was in shock, I was screaming OMG OMG OMG!! 5 minutes later I'm still naked and in shock, another staff member from housekeeping walks in! I couldn't believe it LOL I end up getting a free night out of it as I had complained! Make sure you go to Fat Tuesdays upstairs mmm sooooo good!!
First and the last..... . Picked this hotel on a deal through Priceline. Worst idea ever. Read a couple of reviews, some where good some were bad, so I decided to draw my own conclusion.. The people at the front desk/concierge were rude and weren't concerned about our questions. Anyways we got a room with 2 queen beds. The room:  even tho was "non smoking" smelled like smoke. The bathroom was minuscule. It consisted of a toilet and a shower/ bathtub and behind the door there was your sink and  mirror. Like you'd have to basically go to the bathroom and open the door to go wash your hands. Germs much?. . It was so aggravating, but we didn't go to Vegas to stay in our room.The room was big enough for us and the AC worked so we weren't really complaining since we basically got what we paid for.. . .  We checked out the. Tower at night and it was AMAZING.  We also went down to the pool and it was fun. The Dj played some good jams and we had a blast. We didn't get a chance to check out the rides. . . The location was not the greatest, so far away from all the action! Luckily there was  the "Deuce" bus that ran 24 hours through the whole strip.. . DO NOT GO TO THE BUFFET , THE FOOD IS NOT WORTH IT BY ANY MEANS.. . ROXY'S DINER WAS VERY YUMMY AND THE PRICES WERE REASONABLE.. . The internet was expensive. Went to Starbucks for free internet.. . Looking for a cheap hotel, and you are simply looking for a place to rest your head. Then go for it. If you  are looking for a red carpet treatment, then this place is unfortunately not for you :(
Do yourself a favor and DO NOT STAY HERE!! . . Reason 1: It's all the way at the end of the strip! I mean past everything with some dirty liquor stores,questionable motels and WAIT FOR IT.......BUMS in between. So walking from the hotel to the REAL strip would take at least 20 minutes. I wouldnt even dare walk because you'd probably get mugged or eaten by sludge.. . Reason 2: GHETTO ! The Stratosphere hotel is the equivalent of sleeping on a bench with a bum in downtown LA. I mean talk about dirty and just surrounded by the worst kind of people imaginable. I'm convinced criminals stay at this hotel since its out of site  and smells like a garbage can. The area outside it is even worse! Definitely not a good or safe area . . Reason 3: The Hotel Room itself was disgusting!!! There was LITERALLY blood stains on the Fuckin SHEETS! BLOOD!! Not even just on top but on the SIDES! How does one get blood on the side of a bed!? Murder who knows? But if you can handle blood then you'll love the hard crusty boogers  decorated all of over the bed. In fact i'm pretty sure everything in the room had a booger on it I mean it was just putrid. Anyway lets get to the shower....The shower head was coming out of the wall!!!!! One wrong adjustment and I would've been covered in pipe and drywall. And to top it off it smelled like cigarette asshole in there with no ventilation. I'm not even sure I was breathing oxygen in there.. . I could go on but the thinking about it just makes me sick. NEGATIVE 5 stars! . . DO NOT STAY HERE!!
Descent rooms... and good channel selections if you plan on staying in your room a lot while in LV... The view is fair. Amenities were fair. I say this because the tub stopped up during every shower of our stay. Besides that it was comfortable stay. They should sound proof their walls because u can hear all your neighbors sound effects if u catch my drift ;)
We didn't have a horrid experience, but it wasn't what I would call great either!! We had reserved an upgraded room, it was decent. We were offered another upgrade for 15 a night to which we declined at first but then wanted to do but the lines were just tooooooo long! We placed the do not disturb sign on the door the entire stay but that didn't stop housekeeping... And when we complained management sure didn't seem to either!!!
Came here for the observation deck, which was awesome!  They also have a few rides up top for those looking for an adventure.  Pretty cool.
Parking was convenient and easy enough.  We were able to check in easy enough I waited about 20 minutes on a friday at about 5 pm.  Room that we got was decent and up on a high floor so we had a pretty nice view of the mountains.  The room was clean to the naked eye but since I clean for a living I noticed a lot of areas that have been neglected for at least a few months.  I mean dust and crust in corners that should easily be vacuumed or wiped by housekeeping at least occasionally.  We had 2 flat screen tvs which was very nice and the shower was very large and good water pressure.  The machines in the casino seemed pretty tight because I did not witness any big winners usually at least a couple when I come to vegas.  The employees at the bar seem really pissed off like they do not want to be there.  One bartender told some guy this is not the land of the free drinks you need to play more.  I was like ok maybe he does but don't say it like that.  He flat out said you have to lose more money than you drink.  Bad service in my opinion.  Buffet food was hometown buffet at best and not worth the money but if it is free.  Still not sure...  The pool was not heated and the hot tub was completely full the whole time.  They need to pay some serious attention to some small details and they will be back in business.  The Top of the World Cafe is worth checking out but do not stay here it is too far from the strip and the atmosphere is not welcoming the employees are bitter and do not want to be where they are.  However I was still able to enjoy my stay without a real bad hiccup so hence the 3 stars.
