Okay, so I am changing my review of this hotel as I was upset about an admin fee on a return and they sent me an apology as well as refunded my credit card.  I am sincerely impressed by their customer service and I would stay there again.
Great restaurants and cafes here. If you're casino hopping and looking for good food, this is the place to stop!
I stayed here with my sister and some friends.  It's one of the nicest hotels in Vegas.  We had 2 rooms with a connecting door, and 2 roll out beds.  The rooms were pretty quiet, spacious, and cold due to the blasting of the A/C.  The setup of the hotel/casino is great; it's huge.  You can walk or sit around and people watch.  The crowd is diverse.  We even had some people coming up to us asking questions, promoting, or hollering.  Lastly, if you want to use the internet or gym, of course, you must pay for usage, duh.. . The pool area was nice.  Too bad no real pool party was going on.  My friends and I were too tired to head out to the other pool parties.  Hopefully we can make one next time...
What an amazing hotel...the room was gorgeous and clean with a nice fresh smell. Very spacious. Employees were all helpful and accommodating. I've stayed at other hotels on the strip and this one blew them away. My only complaint would be the prices of some things, but otherwise a great place to stay.
Wynn is by far the most classiest hotel/casino. I have stayed at almost all of the 4-5 star hotels at Vegas but none of them come close to Wynn's level. XS and Surrender are great clubs, their restaurants are amazing (SW Steakhouse), the rooms are spacious with good views. I always stay at the Wynn no matter what.
At registration desk : JJ was very attentive AND CHRISTAL , Lian was very patientionally helped my difficult request and I appreciated ! That's why I prefer pick WYNN even little more expensive . It's very beautiful hotel and staff are all awesome . They try to give me what I want as much as they can... I really love this hotel. I try stay other nice hotels but that was not complete like here. And just staff work here are really great people.

Absolutely the best hotel in Vegas. ...I've stayed at all top resorts abd and wynn is heads and shoulders above  them all.
The hotel is pretty. Most beautiful in Vegas. That's no doubt. Restaurants, shops and entertainment are luxurious. Rooms are spacious, comfortable, have nice views, and service is friendly. . One problem that people post very often about Wynn is that, lower floors are able to hear the noise from the nightclubs at night. Based on my experiences, I've stayed there a couple times, in lower floors and I did not hear a thing. (Yes, i was facing the golf course and yes, I think it was Skrillex who was playing in XS that night). . Other problem people complain a lot about the hotel, is that they charge an expensive, "secret" resort fee for the uses of pools, spa, etc. . Once again, based on my experiences, I can tell you that the resort fee is expensive, but it is no secret. From the moment you arrive to the registration area, staff will ask you if you agree to pay the resort fee. Let's not forget this is a luxury hotel, and even though I think the resort fee is expensive, it is very well worth it. . Those are the problems people post very often, other complains include: long lines, security, etc. All I can think of, is that maybe those people had bad luck and experienced a not very enjoyable stay, because overall, the hotel is prepared to give the ultimate vegas experience. . My Tip: This is a hotel that has a lot to offer, but in order to do that, your budget has to be prepared. It is not an ideal hotel for people who are looking forward to save money or buy a shirt that is not above 1000 dollars.
The highest end hotel in Vegas, Steve Weinberg (now Wynn) once sat, literally, on top of this hotel with his legs dangling off the edge to brag about how great it was compared to the rest of the hotels on the strip.  He was correct.
My husband and I were visiting from LA for a 2 nights stay at Wynn. During our stay, my husband got a really bad allergic reaction to the sheets in our room. He woke up with bumps and redness all over his body. So I called the front desk to report this problem. The security guy came to our room in time and they called  paramedic for us. The paramedic crews gave my husband a shot and he felt better after that. Then the security told us they will have the sheets changed for us, we asked for a new room since we do not feel comfortable in that room. When I was picking up the new key in the front desk, (Holly is the one who helped me, she is really nice and helpful) I talked to the hotel manager Shawn. After I told him my husband felt extremely uncomfortable about the allergy and it might be allergic to the sheets in our room.(My husband never had allergic reaction before). He tried to push the responsibility of this incident, he said "I have allergy too, I am taking pills. Your husband's reaction may not be related to our hotel and we have no control about allergy " He was very polite to me but every sentence he said is about " my husband's reaction is nothing related to the hotel." Then I tried to explain to him that my husband has a meeting tomorrow morning in LA, but we may not drive four hours back under my husband's physical condition. So we may extend one more night of our stay in Wynn. He said it is fine to stay one more night,  but hotel is not responsible for the charge. I told him we are already facing a loss since my husband had to cancel the meeting which is really important. I did not blame the hotel for the allergy, but I need a proper solution to the problem that we have during our stay. And I quote what he said to me "we have over 5000 guests everyday, we cannot give complimentary stay due to guests' PERSONAL ISSUES, I hope you understand my hands are tight. If you have more question you should contact guest claim department since they are PROFESSIONAL" I was really disappoint to his reply but since my husband was still waiting for me in the room, I decided to pay for the extra night and let my husband rest well(he was very tired and dizzy after the shot). Then I told Shawn I need the hypoallergenic sheets in my new room, he said he will contact house keeping department immediately to change them. When we got into the new room, my husband lay down because he was so dizzy and uncomfortable, we assumed that the sheets have already been changed. After 20 minutes I received a call said they will have someone to change the sheets and towels, I said okay and told my husband to get off the bed immediately since we did not know those sheets were not hypoallergenic. Unfortunately he started to have more reaction on his skin where touched the sheets and pillows(face and upper arm since he was wearing t shirt and pants)  We sat on the sofa waited for more than one hour for the hypoallergenic sheets to come, then I asked Holly to contact security again since my husband felt worse over time The paramedics came again and suggested my husband to take some antiallergic pills which are sold in the shop downstairs. The housekeeping lady changed the sheets and towels AFTER 2 hours we moved to a new room. After the paramedics left, I called Holly to ask Shawn come to my room so he can see my husband's condition. Shawn called me back said he couldn't come to our room at the time since he has a MEETING afterwards. I told him we were very disappointed for their response since we have to wait so long to get our sheets changed in our new room. He told me that because I said my husband was resting so they do not want to disturb us, and the hypoallergenic sheets required time to prepare.  In fact, the housekeeping department already had my permission to change those sheets, they just never came. I told Shawn I was tired of all the excuses and lacking of attention, and I needed guest claims department to contact me ASAP. When the lady from guests claims contacted me ( I believe her last name was Matthew, could be wrong) she kept question me what do I want him to do over and over again, I told her everything had already happened and they did not gave me any options since the beginning. She said she is sorry that they disappointed us, but she could not gave us a free night of stay and they could not control allergy reactions. Then she questioned me why did my husband laid down when he knew the sheets were not changed. WHO THE HELL WOULD DO THAT! The attitude she gave me made me feel so cheap that we could trade my husband's health for one free night of stay. Then she kept telling me that because I said my husband needs to rest, so they would not disturb us to change the sheets, and the hypoallergenic sheets need time to prepare. But the truth is we reported the allergic reaction around 11 am. The sheets were actually changed around 3:30 pm. MORE THAN 4 HOURS TO PREPARE THE DAMN SHEETS?C the update for the rest of story
The landscaping of this hotel is beautiful. I love the trees and plants around which gives it a very refreshing ambiance. The hotel is pretty spacious and love the fact that it's not as crowded like other hotels. The rooms are spacious and when you get a high floor, view can be quite nice. The only downside is the shops aren't as many and there aren't as much restaurants to pick from. Also, they are very strict and giving you extra blankets and bed in the room which I found quite weird. Other than that, I don't mind giving this hotel another shot.
This is by far the best hotel I have stayed at in Vegas. I am not a frequent visitor and have stayed at MGM and Mandalay the other 2 times.. . I got a very good rate using Priceline bidding and I was a little worried that I might be treated differently. I was also concerned that they would charge extra for my kids as they normally do show an extra charge for the kids when booking with them directly. My reservation showed a room with 1 king bed.. . My worries were quickly laid to rest. We got an excellent room on the 60th floor which was the highest floor on the non-Tower section. The staff was very friendly. I wasn't charged anything extra, although I did not mention kids. I did ask them if I could get a room with 2 Queen beds and they switched it without any issues.. . Another thing I had read was that Wynn did not allow strollers, but I did have any problem using one for our toddler. The staff would check room cards when going towards the Resort elevators but would always do it with a smile and would joke with my 10 year old.. . The rooms have a decent amount of automation which my kids loved. The swimming pool was open in early February and was heated. It was good to be able to go to the pool with the kids, though the pool wasn't anything special. The fact that it was open during the winters was one of the reasons I went for the bidding for this area and star level.
My friends and I went to Vegas for a few days; one of them had a free voucher for being a VIP guest so we were able to stay in one of their luxurious suites, the Panoramic Corner.  It had floor to ceiling windows where you can see an overview of the Strip!  The room was very spacious with a work area, beautiful marble bath, a separate shower, even a water closet with a flat screen TV - yahoo!  clean lines, bright, and very nice!  The beds were very comfortable with lovely sheets.  The hotel has several dining options on-site, some nightclubs, as well as the home of some of the shows (like the Le Reve).  Definitely a nice hotel on the southern part of the Strip to stay at if you're in town; they have shuttles and public transportation that comes frequently.
I will never stay anywhere else again. I have stayed at the Cosmo, I have seen the Bellagio and several other of the hotels. My experience here was amazing because I have several food allergies like gluten and dairy and every restaurant was so helpful and also delicious. . . The clientele here is above board, classy, and the hotel never felt like a zoo like some of the other hotels. I also appreciate that the scene here is more mature, not the trying to get laid scene like at the Cosmo. Every single staff member was professional and friendly. The casino was clean and beautiful The whole place smells like flowers, and the grounds are amazing. I can't wait to go back.
First off I feel very weird here. It's like they hide trash cans because they look bad... That's the dumbest thing ever... Oh wait... I just paid $11 to each someone microwave old Mac n cheese for me! And they don't even try and hide it. "The Cafe" is really the opposite. The workers are so happy because of the "Wynn" way! I asked if that was my meal being scooped out of container Awkwardly as if it was breaking concrete. . . Honestly, if your by yourself, there's 0, yes ZERO realistic quick food options. . . This place needs more... Way more!
Pricey but reasonable!  Best place to go to in Las Vegas best hotel best in everything!
If you want a good nights sleep don't stay here. Really. Don't stay here. When we walked into the hotel we were amazed by the inventive beauty of the lobby, the beautiful fresh flowers, the eye to design detail. When we checked in the lovely woman at the front desk suggested that we upgrade our room to a higher floor because it would be quieter. So we did. We went to our room on the 59th floor and were amazed....it was a spectacular room. As we walked in we turned the lights on and with one switch the lights went on and the drapes opened automatically, displaying an amazing view of the golf course. So far so amazing! There are three of us in our family and I thought it was strange that they had only two bed options...a king size or two DOUBLE beds. No double queen beds. I thought that was a little strange. Who doesn't have double queens? Who, in this day of comfort, uses double beds?. . When it came time to go to bed we hit the switch from one of the automatic lighting panels to turn all lights off, and the lights didn't go off. There were red lights shining down on the two pieces of art. There were three red spot lights shining down from the ceiling that would not turn off. Then there was the control panel that was lit up like the dash board of a 747. The only control panel that went dark was the temperature panel. The other four were shinning brightly.  There was a red spot light in the hall way that would not turn off. Seriously. I s#*t you not. Have you ever heard of such an amazingly awful thing in a hotel room? We sleep in a totally dark room. It's been proven to provide a deeper, mor complete sleep. I can not freaking believe that a hotel would go to such lengths to create such a beautiful space without paying any attention to the comfort of the client. And the beds were extra firm mattresses. So uncomfortable. . . And did I mention the disco beat that we could hear all night long? Yes, it's true. It was a constant and continual beat. All night. No wonder she encouraged us to upgrade our room. I'm so glad we did. . . We stayed at the mirage the night before coming to the Wynn and had an excellent experience. The room was not fancy, but the beds were comfortable and the room was dark! . . Do not EVER stay at the Wynn I'd you want to sleep. And when in Vegas, you do need at least a few hours of complete down time!
this review is for last summer experience! . . We stayed 7days at Wynn Tower suite for romantic get away  :) . . this place is most beautiful hotel in las vegas !! . best service !
I love the Wynn. The staff, rooms and whole experience was great. They have good bacon too. I paid a lot for coffee at their cafe and it was made wrong, but the lovely young man, Dejaun, fixed it promptly and made me feel valued. I would def stay here again and hopefully get to golf their one day.
