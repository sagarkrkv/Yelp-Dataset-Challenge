Me and 3PR ended up here on a whim, but it was actually really good.  I had the kobe slider trio and one of their milkshakes, and I wasn't disappointed.  Service was not great, it wasn't really clear whether or not our waiter was ever going to show up to take our order, but once he did things improved a bit.  The burgers are quality and so are the shakes, I would recommend both.  Definitely overpriced, as I somehow ended up paying $30+ for what I had.  That's Las Vegas for you.
I sampled several of their burgers, and I felt they were all missing something.  On the positive, the buffalo fries with blue cheese were surprisingly tasty!  At the price point, it's not worth it, head over to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant and get a 21- burger that will leave you happy.
I think if you like burgers it's good but I wasn't that impressed. . . The portino was good ( spicy) one but not worth 20. Counters way better or even gordon Ramsey's burgr.  . . Shake eh.  . . But in a pinch I'll go there . . Also their table system was slow. Tons of open tables but they take people in order vs by seat size so you sit there going huh? Tables before me have 5so they waiting but 3 tables of 2 are free yet I'm still waiting.
I had to leave the family after a nice vacation and fly into Las Vegas for a business meeting. Arriving a day early and having the night free I ventured into this place, ordered a terrific hamburger with slabs of thick bacon and watched some March madness. Everyone was attentive and helpful.
I went here about four days ago with my boyfriend for our burger craving since I've had it bookmarked for a while. It seemed a little small inside but it had modern appeal, a bar area and several TVs.. As for food, we shared the money business shake which was banana flavored with Reese's peanut butter cup pieces. It wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be and had a homey taste to it. It tasted of fresh banana, none of that artificial stuff. I got the American Wagyu Burger which had truffle aioli, brie, spinach, portabello  mushrooms and of course wagyu beef! It was delicious! It reminded me of the funghi burger at Holsteins except for in this burger, you could taste much more of the meat and the truffle flavor wasn't as extreme (which doesn't bother me but anyways). I would definitely eat that again! My boyfriend got the I-80 Burger which had peppercorn crusted bacon, bbq sauce, sharp cheddar, and caramelized onions. Delicious also! You could really tasted the peppercorn which made it a little different from the typical bbq bacon cheeseburgers. Both were good portions, about the size of Gordon Ramsey's burGR, and the meat had more distinct flavor in it compared to Holstein's and burGR.  The only thing about our food that I didn't care for were the two orders of fries we got. I got regular curly fries and they seemed a little stale, like they were cooked in advance and were just sitting for an hour or two under the heat lamps. Pass on those. Next, my boyfriend got buffalo fries which are fries drenched in buffalo sauce topped with feta and green onions. It's a good concept just not executed great. The fries were super soggy! It would have been a little better if the sauce was just drizzled on.. Our service was nothing special, she was friendly enough, and checked on us twice to make sure our water was filled and didn't take forever to bring out the check so it was still good even though she was really quiet.. Overall the food was delicious, but I still think I would choose BurGR and Holstein's over this place mainly because I liked the shakes and fries much better in those other two locations. If this place wasn't in Vegas, where it has soo much competition, I think ratings would be much higher.
Place is fun, but just a tad bit overwhelming. Portions are pretty big, so great for sharing. Their shakes are tasty and unique. Burgers were good, and I loved their fries! Ordered the nachos with bbq pork as an appetizer, not a huge fan of that one. Everything else made up for it. The line might look intimidating, but it goes quickly and it's worth the wait.
Ordered the interstate 80 burger. I liked i. Huge portion for myself. . The meal with a beer was very satisfying. Asian waiter needed some personality tho.
Super sad let down. Don't know if they were too tired but it was late and I wished I would have went to Mickey Dees across the street. The burger was ok, I orders the blue cheese burger and it was drowning in balsamic. I had to take it apart to eat it. The fries, $5 for them and cold... Ok , lukewarm and hard. Never again.
Good burgers - went twice.. Ordered an appetizer the 2nd time... not great.. Will go back for the burgers.
Great service, mediocre food. Frozen patties and fries. Food comes lukewarm. Great concept. Poorly executed.
Next to In-N-Out Burger, BLT Burger is my favorite burger joint in Vegas.  Food is great, burgers are flavorful, and the staff is prompt and friendly.  I also like that you can see the chefs cooking the burgers from basically anywhere in the restaurant.  If you haven't eaten here yet and you're in Vegas, give it a try.
Awful. Awful. Awful. Came in at 11:30pm on a Friday night with a large group. We asked to sit at all separate tables as we didn't mind not sitting together and it was more important that we get in and out in a timely manner. Instead we were sat altogether.  Our server came over to greet us and we informed him we would need separate checks, to which he responded, "It will take a lot longer to separate your checkout. It would be better if you could just all throw cash in." ....um duh. If we could all throw in cash, we would. He continued to give us attitude and was rude throughout our entire meal. Now, the fried pickles and milkshake were amazing. But when our burgers came, the patties and fries were cold. Like cold cold.  Not even a couple warm bites or warm in the center. Because our food had taken so long already and all we wanted to do was leave, we kept our mouths shut, but under any other circumstances, we all would have sent out entrees back. Our checkout process was an absolute mess to boot. Hector was our server.  Maybe he had a bad day, and I don't mean to judge, but geez Louise he was a disaster of a server in all areas. If you're a hot mess, the least you could do is pretend to be accommodating and friendly.  Needless to say, not one member of our group will ever be returning, but I'm sure the place does well enough without us, considering most of their patrons are drunk and can't tell the difference.
