Overall a great experience here.  Food options weren't the greatest but I didn't see anything except for the terminal i left and came out of.
So it wouldn't have occurred to me to review the airport, because it's just the airport. It's where you go when you have to go somewhere. But on my Yelp homepage at the top, it's asking me if I've ever been and if I'd like to review it. I had some time on my hands so I figure what the heck. Let's talk about the CLT airport.. . It's actually my second favorite airport in the US, Denver being the first. We can't compete with the Denver airport with its super cool art shops and the fact that during one four hour layover I had a full steak meal complete with bison ribeye and a bottle of red wine. CLT-Douglas doesn't have bison ribeyes. They do, however, have a Bad Daddy's... But without the bison. My hubs and I eat at Bad Daddy's in Dilworth for all of our burger needs and always ALWAYS upgrade to the bison. It's delicious and so much better for you than beef. So we were pretty excited to learn they were opening an airport location. Why the airport location cut the bison (and robust beer list) from their menu, I'm not sure. So in that case, I switch to the turkey burger, which is actually pretty juicy and delicious itself. . . But I digress - the airport... I really like our airport. It's clean, modern and easy to navigate. Security is rarely super bad, and if it is, you can hoof it down to either A or E concourses and usually get right in. I'm not going to say that every person I've encountered at a ticket counter was a ray of sunshine but I don't remember any particular incidents to count toward the negative. I love the rocking chairs, which are dispersed throughout the airport, usually in front of large windows so you can rock and watch the planes if you so choose. . . Another recent addition is Beaudevin, which I LOVE. It's an upscale sort of wine lounge, where you can chill on a chic sofa and sip on some wine, or get a snack if you're feeling peckish for something other than fast food. Even though it's right in the middle of the main thoroughfare, it still feels like a quiet escape. The decor is so very not-airport, with artsy chandeliers and those chic sofas I mentioned. (They do have table seating if you want to tuck into some food in a more serious manner.) . . They've added more charging ports in waiting areas now so that's a convenience. I don't think they have as many as some bigger airports do, but it's definitely better than it used to be when every one at the gate was competing to sit on the floor by the one wall outlet. Progress! . . If you're after Starbucks, the lines can get a little long and each location in the airport doesn't serve the same snacks. I waited in line at one and wasn't able to get the breakfast sandwich I so desired. (I would've honestly rather had an airport bloody mary to be honest but I was traveling with my boss for work on this occasion. Because that's part of the fun of airports - morning bloody marys because you can.). . There aren't any special shops I find the need to hit when I go to the airport like there are in Denver, but I kind of feel like this is a plus for my home airport. I'm there so often that it would cost me a lot of money to have a go-to shopping destination every time I travel. I get by just fine with the choice of Bad Daddy's (if I'm hungry) or Beaudevin if I just want to have a relaxing beverage while I wait for my flight. Sadly, I don't often have time to enjoy the rocking chairs, but I still like knowing they're there. . . Oh, and my dad introduced me to the valet parking and I haven't been able to go back to regular. Especially while they're working on the new garage construction. I'm too spoiled. Sure I could spend that money on a billion other things, and I should, but there's something just so fancy about being able to walk off the plane, pay a fee and have my car brought right to me. Because let's face it - nobody likes airport parking.
I really like the Charlotte airport.  The flight selection is decent and the size of the airport is just about right, not too big and not too small.  The food options are great with lots of barbecue of course, a Jamba Juice, and a pretty good sushi place too.
I've been flying into Charlotte for most of my adult life ..... Mostly because flying into Columbia is so god awful expensive. It's always been a pleasant experience with no real hiccups ever.  . . Current construction on the parking structure means parking further away and taking a shuttle.. . The airport itself is cozy ( quite small ) but has everything one might need at the beginning of a travel day or at the end. . . TONS of hotel options in the area. . . A fair amount of food options throughout the terminal. . . There IS a Starbucks. . . The TSA process seems to be relatively organized ( that's saying something ).. . The staff of the airport are actually very friendly, and this extends to the restaurant employees as well ( please refer to my Wendy's review ).. . Too badthere isn't a non-stop from Honolulu ( there used to be with US Airways ), I would gladly pay a little more for that option. . . Easy to get around. Signs are easy to read and navigate. . . I'm sure I'll continue to frequent CLT unless something makes Columbia  cheaper.
I am US Airways miles holder so most of my trips route through Charlotte. It by far one of my favorite airports. It is easy to navigate  and has plenty of choices for food and shopping if you have a long layover.
Tiny little airport that does what it needs to do - one could also fly directly into Atlanta and catch the shuttle out to Chattanooga, which I might do next time and avoid the joy of flying on a small plane. Taxi to downtown Charlotte is about $30
The one-star review nearly wrote itself as I stepped into an older portion of the concourse from the tarmac. Outdated fluorescent lighting, worn carpet and a limited number of obvious power outlets made a pending two-hour layover seem like it was going to be a short eternity.. . ...then the airport all-call announced that Sunday church services were being offered in the Main Terminal, above the Cinnabon ("Yes": the phrase 'above the Cinnabon' was part of the announcement...). Without an excuse to leave the gate, my opinion of CLT would have remained justifiably low.. . Heading towards the terminal building, a few things became apparent:. 1) Some parts of the airport haven't been touched in years. Others are just fine.. 2) US Airways is the dominant carrier.. 3) Rocking chairs make for happier passengers.. 4) Security checkpoints are at the front so passengers don't have to go through multiple checkpoints to connect between concourses.. . The terminal itself is reasonably modern with adequate signage, moving sidewalks, a variety of shops and restaurants, dozens upon dozens of the aforementioned rocking chairs and scattered power outlets. If you're inbound, I'd suggest checking out the old-school map on CLT's website if you want to grab some food or a book between flights.
Five years later, it's time to update my CLT review. Between 4/4/2009 and today, I've departed from or arrived at this airport over 100 times. I've also gotten a couple of gate passes to escort my daughter through security.. . CLT is still a good airport for layovers. Lots of restaurant options from a fancy wine bar to a sit down burger joint, plus a full spectrum of fast food. The main atrium even has a pretty good barbecue spot if you're looking for Carolina 'cue and can't leave the secure zone.. . For those departing from CLT, you can use *any* of the security checkpoints. Unlike some airports (Newark), once you're inside Charlotte you can go to any gate. The line at A is usually pretty long, so feel free to wander up to B or C if they look shorter.. . Southwest, United and Delta are in the A concourse. American is also there but might be moving as a result of the merger. JetBlue and Lufthansa are in D, I believe.. . Tips:. - Rental car franchises are not located in the terminal - you do have to catch your company's shuttle bus.. - There's not a smoking lounge inside the secure area. You have to go outside and follow the signs.. - B and E checkpoints have TSA Precheck lines. Other checkpoints have "elite" security queues which are not specific to just US Airways. Any elite passenger is allowed to use it!. - There are TWO US Airways Clubs. With US moving to the OneWorld alliance, American Airlines folks who have Admiral's Club access can use these clubs.. . Consider trying Park 'N Go instead of Business Valet. I find their service is better and cheaper than the airport's service.
Been here several times. Fairly convenient parking, good places to eat. Just a nice airport as airports go.
Good enough airport that's easy enough to navigate.  Okay food options, as well.  Nothing special and nothing bad.
Easy to park at the long term lots and at a good rate.  Security lines are annoyingly long for not that busy of an airport.  Usually because they only have 1 scanner open at a time.
Nice small little airport,  some nice places to eat and decently easy to navigate when your all messed up. Thankfully for me I travel well and know my way around so it was too bad for me after I got some food in me which there are plenty of places to eat here
My favorite places to fly in and out of.
The A concourse where I fly out of is old and does not have enough seating. Otherwise it's a fine mid sized airport. The roads around the airport are a total mess and some are closed off
I don't get why a lot of people seem to have so many issues with this airport. I may understand people to complain how this once humble and low-key airport has grown into this major hub, but it's honestly a great airport.. . From a functionality standpoint, this is actually one o the best airports I've ever been to. Betwen the moment I lzft the plane and got my suitcase, barely 20 minutes had passed. Talk about efficiency! This resulkts in this airport being actually great for layovers. I have not been through border controls here, but from what i've heard it's astonishingly swift. Also, the staff members here are honestly some of the nicest, most courteous people I've seen at an airport (and given that many were US Ariways employees, that's saying a lot). Finally, there are so many eateries here. I got to the airport early for a morning flight, and got a stunning breakfast there.. . But I do indeed have two concerns with CLT. First off, there are far too many constructions going on, which ruins the scenery. I understand that it is a rapidly growing airport (it's US Airways' largest hub) and that it is expected to grow even more in the near future with a large increase in European destinations, but the management of the airport should be more organized with its growth. Then, the different piers/terminals are ridiculously laid out. This is the kind of airport where you may have to run from one end to the other to catch a connecting flight. . . In general, CLT is an amazing airport, and certainly the BEST I've seen in the US. This is an airport with a promising future, and with the rise of Charlotte as a great American city, I'm looking forward to seeing it again in the coming years.
I have connected at this air port hundreds of times, but this trip was my first time as Charlotte being the final destination.  It was easy to get to the baggage area, and easy to get to transportation.  CLT is one of the cleanest, best airports I travel through.
the airport has certainly grown over the last 10 years.  great ambiance with the rocking chairs in the atrium for passengers that have a long wait between flights and do not wish to wait at their gate.  continue to grow and hurry up and finish with the construction with the parking!!!
I ALWAYS seem to have a lay over here when I'm going anywhere back home to Ohio, or to visit N.C. . . And all the times all my flights have been on time, nice airport. . . I love the rocking chairs they have for you to sit out throughout the airport. . . OHH and by the way they have nice and clean restrooms, because they have the bathroom attendants that help!
1. Crowded with narrow walkways.. 2. Wi-Fi - Low capacity bandwidth, free as they know it's value.. 3. Friendly gate personnel.. 4. Good selection of places to eat.. 5. Starbucks everywhere - good.
Came to this airport to connect to another flight. Had a 12 hour layover which is fine because I was made aware of this upon booking the flight. Went downstairs to baggage claim because the airline overhead compartments were full (again no big deal). Picked up luggage only to be told cannot go back upstairs where restaurants since we left out the main area of the airport!? I informed the agent that we have not eaten and ONLY came downstairs because that's we were advised to do. She informed us that there was a Starbucks and that we could eat there (totally not what I was looking forward to). . . BUT I can deal with that..although I was very upset at the moment. What I cannot deal with are MICE running past my feet upon working on my computer and eating my sandwich!! This is totally UNACCEPTABLE for an airport and I advise EVERYONE that comes to this airport to watch your bags..and don't put them on the floor!! This is the last time I will be flying into Charlotte airport if I can help it..and If I have to come here I will just rent a car and drive...smh. . Dissatisfied customer ...
if you fly US Air, you're eventually going to end up here for an hour or so. Not a bad place to send a short time. Even if you are connecting from one US Air flight to another, expect a walk, but you will pass by plenty of tempting restaurants ad food vendors, so it's an entertaining walk. Unlike some other airports I could mention, Charlotte is clean and well-maintained. Lots of moving sidewalks to speed us on to the next gate.
This review is solely based on my experience in the prayer room. It is upstairs tucked into a quiet corner with very little foot traffic which means no interruptions. The chapel as it is called is interfaith and contains a Quran,bible, and Torah available. There are also prayer mats for Muslims, and an altar to kneel at. I believe they also have have sacrament available for communion but you need to contact staff. . Being Muslim I really appreciated the quiet serenity to be able to pray without feeling rushed to do so. I used the room twice upon arrival an departure when praying the second time around I was joined by a catholic gentleman so the room does get use. Thank you CD airport for a blessing to passengers needing a place to pray and worship.
