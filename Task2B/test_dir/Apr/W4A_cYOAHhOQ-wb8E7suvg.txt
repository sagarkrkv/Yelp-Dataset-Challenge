Hearing a lot and I mean a LOT of raves from friends about Le Reve , so made plans for after Valentines dinner. . . Dinner was great @ Border Grill (review later) and after a short drive to Wynn and an even shorter wait time for the entrance we had no problem getting to our sits, the staff were very helpful and very accommodating. . . The show started with a bang! The kind that takes your breath away and with that precedence the whole show was spectacular. I will not spoil it for anyone but it is a must see show wherein you will appreciate the physicality, nerve and the countless hours of preparation this performers (athletes) put into the show needless to say death-defying.. . A must see show for Vegas visitors and locals =-)
This show is amazing! A must if you are in Vegas. We got the VIP seats with champaign & strawberry's and it was worth the price. The seats are on the back row and they are the best view in the whole place:-)
One of the most amazing things I've ever seen; a beautiful and inspiring work of art.  I laughed, teared up, got chills, gasped and got rushes of adrenaline.  A total blast!. . Loved the narrative, the context of dreaming was so well done and contemplating the logistics alone is an entertainment.
Let me just say - ALL SEATS ARE GOOD!  Don't make the mistake of buying a more expensive ticket because all seats in this entire stadium (so to speak) are great. We ordered drinks (which were EW gross), and settled in our third row.  The seats directly in front of us were cheaper, but located in the "splash zone".  I did not see one single person get wet the entire night.. . The show itself is awesome, visually stunning and very entertaining.  I enjoyed the acrobatic, and also the visual effects.. . This is definitely a must see in Vegas.  I've been to a few shows, and this one ranks right up there in my top 3.
Hello....so I have been some some cirque shows on the strip and I must say that this one is super groovy.  It is a 365-degree arena and the seats are all good.  I got the last row seat and I could still see the show.  HOWEVER, if I was to buy tickets again, I would go for middle-row seats.  I wouldn't want too close because of their aerial acts and looking up all the time would give me a neck crick.  No fun! . . They have water act, aerial act, romance, intrigue, drama, and just really cool sound and lighting effects.  They story is very easy to follow (I usually try to research the story ahead of time but I didn't have time this time round).  This show left ME in a state of dreaminess and relaxation.  Honestly, it is a superb show.  It was too bad for me that I didn't see this show when it first opened yearrrsss ago!  :)
A friend has wanted to see this show for some time now, so when we found ourselves with a free evening in Vegas, she convinced me to see the show. I'm so glad that I went!. . I don't think there's a bad seat in the house, but the VIP section at the top probably would have disappointed me had I paid for those seats. No no, my tickets purchased from one of those same day ticket places for $123 was the perfect seat. I saw everything perfectly!. . Absolutely amazing show by some extremely talented people. How they hold on and do the things they did with such precision is beyond me. I certainly got my money out of the show, and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to see a show while in Vegas.
Le Reve is a MUST SEE in Las Vegas. What an amazing show! It was a combination of amazing talent, great music and super creative set. All the performers in Le Reve are extremely talented and you could tell they are all very passionate about what they do. The way the theater is designed is brilliant, any seat in the theater you would have a perfect view. Le Reve definitely exceed my expectation and I wouldn't mind going again to see it when I'm up in Las Vegas.
I was looking forward to this show for a long time especially after reading reviews saying it was comparable to O. If you're debating whether to see O or this, definitely go with O. This world class show is nowhere near world class. No-flash photography is allowed at the show. However, they ask that videos not be taken. Well, that's where the Wynn Theatre ushers make even mall cops seem decent. Be prepared to be distracted every 3 minutes by theatre staff shining their flashlights and waving their hands in the air, even walking in front of audience members to "bust" audience members taking videos. My experience was completely ruined by venue staff overly enforcing the non-video rule. BE WARNED. You WILL be distracted unless you're sitting up real close.
Amazing show! I have nothing to compare it too since this was my first live 'circus' show but I was definitely blown away. Maybe the only con I could think of is that this show tends to be a little draggy after a while but its simply ENCHANTING nevertheless esp the hanging performers. . . Although we were sitting in the splash zone and I looked like an idiot with a jacket on my legs, we did not get sprayed by water. I still am conflicted if I should be disappointed or relieved :). . Definitely see it if you are in the area. Thumbs up!
Amazing show, with stunning performers, breathing taking stunts and acrobatics, creative choreography, and beautiful dancing in the water! The stage effects were phenomenal. The stage is set in a huge pool of water. It features thrilling high dives off from really high up on the stage into the deep water. The plot is filled with romance and action. The show is good for all ages.. . The show is at the Wynn casino. The theater is intimate. All of the seats were good, even if you are in the last row. . . Con's:. - expensive. - it was hard to follow the plot. . You really can't go wrong with Cirque du Soleil. All of the shows are amazing. If you are in Vegas, make sure you see one of the Cirque du Soleil show's.
I've seen all the Cirque shows in Vegas. This is by far the best. Spend the extra $ & get the VIP seats. High back comfy chairs w/little table to hold choc covered strawberries & bottle of champagne that comes w/VIP seats. Plus monitors at your feet that show what's happening back stage & under water. Awesome show.
Beautiful show at the Wynn. Love the circle theater. Doesn't matter where you sit, anywhere is a good view. The show had a romantic story with a diverse array of characters, good and bad. The water effects and moving stage were great. I only took pictures at the end so I could enjoy the show in the moment, which I highly recommend. Save your program to look back on the show.
