With the list of hot celebrity chef restaurants its hard to figure out where to eat first.   We were staying at the Bellagio and had been watching the MLife channel (I know who watches tv when in vegas) ANNNYYWAYY, they featured this restaurant.  Todd English is not an english place, which threw us off... in a good way.  We stopped by spontaneously bc we were pretty hungry.  We split the burger (which you need to try with truffle cheese)  It was very good.  The quality of the meat was excellent and well seasoned. . . Even better, I found 'My Drink"!  Best drink I've had the whole trip... the two pear i believe it is called.  Minimal ingredients, and pear puree.  soooo good and not overly sweet (which I was afraid it would be)  Such a great drink.  It should be their signature.  . . Check out this place, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy the view and relaxed atmosphere
Solidly four stars.  . . Not a cheap date, but expect well executed Mediterranean-inspired food, creative drink, and efficient service in a wonderful space, overlooking the amazing Bellagio water show outside.. . It can be loud inside, but the expectation should be to sit outside on the patio on all but inclement conditions.  It's worth the wait, as the water show is spectacular and elevates the Olives experience.. . Make reservations early.  Don't wait until the day-of if you want prime time, and note that patio seating is first come, first served, even with a reservation.. . The drink menu and wine list are on a balky, awkward iPad device.  The list is impressive, for sure, and yes, they are pretty pictures and great descriptions.  But Olives' use oftechnology for technology's sake is overly complicated, imoho.  KISS.. . Parking at the Bellagio is free if you self park, though the hike from the garage through the casino and on to the restaurant may be a bit much for women in heels.  Valet or a cab drop off at the Bellagio front door is a shorter walk.
First off, if you got the balcony seating, the view to the Bellagio fountain is spectacular. That was what I got and wow, was that fun!!. . Unfortunately, food was so so. Actually, it was worse than so so. The tuna tartare was fine but had a hard time finishing it as it was quite oily. The squid was fine but on the softer side and had a little off texture. The handmade pasta were mushy and waayy too soft. I didn't enjoy eating it. I had the fettuccine carbonara with crab. Not good.. . The signature dessert was chocolate lava cake. It was okay but lava cake is ordinary. Standard at best. Todd English's restaurant..mind you. But whatever. It doesn't mean much at times even if a famous chef's name attached to it.
It's a good lunch place for business meetings or dates. If you are lucky, you can sit out on the patio for an awesome view of the fountains. The interior decor is hip and contemporary with some booth seatings. . . Unfortunately, the food is quite disappointing. For starter, the beef carpaccio was unappetizing and the presentation was too. There's mushy beef on top of salad and polenta. It was a bit gross with a huge portion too. The mussels capellini dish was alright, but it was nothing special. The mussels were fresh though. The lunch beef sirloin is quitebig, but the edges taste a bit burnt. The meat was chewy and tasted gamey. . . Overall, come for the potential of patio view and nice decor. The food is average at best especially for Vegas standards at top hotels.
I ate here when it first opened (that is, when Bellagio first opened) a zillion years ago and it was spectacular then. This week I finally had the opportunity to come back. I brought a very choosy eater with me, but I had scoped out the menu in advance and figured there'd be enough variety to make both of us happy.. . Service was attentive, but a little detached - not really warm. That's OK, I mean it's Vegas, I'm not there to make friends, but the other places where I ate, the servers managed a little friendliness.. . Seating was not as tight as it is in some other places, but they do bunch together all the table-for-two diners so we're practically in each others' laps. Wouldn't be too bad if peoples' behavior was uniformly civilized, but naturally that's not the case so you might end up with an undesirable dining "companion" from the next table staring at every forkful you put into your mouth.. . ANYWHO. You came here to read about the food, not the other person there, who you probably will never run into anyway! Well I started with the Bibb salad which was overly oniony for most people, but perfect for me. My own dining companion ate most of our shared bucket of bread - there were four different varieties, with two pieces of each, and an olive and tapenade plate to spread on them. Rich, salty, saucy - a great starter.. . For our entrees, I got the scallops on a truffle-mashed potato bed, starting out nutritiously-conscious enough by diligently eating all of the sauteed sea greens first, but then dropped the act and over my own but-I-really-shouldn't protests I licked the whole melty truffly scallopy plate clean. The scallops were like perfectly broiled butter-pats of the sea, not an iota of rubbery or chewiness. High marks.. . My companion developed an epic inability to make a decision, suffering a choice-freeze of Shakespearean proportions, so he ended up ordering three sides instead of an entree: A side of lobster tail (oh em gee, how spoiled can you get - just the tail? None of the effort? He's not from New England), a side of grilled shrimp (anyone else counting the cholesterol points, or am I just copping a sea-bean-eatin', healthier-than-thou attitude? But wait), and a side of ... lobster mac and cheese. He was in bliss. Ah, to have a twenty-years-younger heart!. . Other reviewers had mentioned how dark it is in the interior seating area, and that's no joke. It takes a long time to get adjusted. Luckily the bill comes on a lighted notepad (no, really) so even if you can't really see what you're eating, you can at least see what you're paying.
Great views, amazing bread and olive tapenade (sp?). Out server Jamie was very very very great! I am vegan and she suggested ways to alter their dishes to make them vegan friendly. Great service, great food, great atmosphere. Oh, and John Stamos was sitting next to us.
Lucky enough to get a table just strolling by.  Of course, we were dressed up, so that may have helped. In any case I'm not a meat eater but I still found something TE here-the parsnip puree was to die for. My martini was so so so delicious. Service was perfection. We had a lovely table, not on the patio but lovely nonetheless. Other diners were super happy, and my dining partner had a really good looking steak, which she truly enjoyed.  If, and it's a big if, I ever go back to Vegas, I will for sure eat here again, and bring my husband. Maybe :-).
Ate at Olive's a few years back and returned for a business dinner, it was just as good the second time as the first. Everyone enjoyed their meals and the great service. Highly recommend the flatbreads for an appetizer and the gnocchi for dinner. Try to get a seat near the windows so you can get a view of the Bellagio fountains throughout dinner.
Great starter , octopuss with squids grilled. I ordered the sword fish , kind disappointed . Was too butter taste like. Wine was good. Too expensive though , I understand the mark up but this was a bit too much.. My wife and I usually stay at the Wynn . And we dine out at bartolotta ristorante Di mare. Very expensive but worth every penny's
I recently traveled to Las Vegas for a trip. I stayed at the Wynn, which I highly suggest, but I wanted to eat at Olives and watch the fountains. I am gluten free and dairy free, I have to say that over all my experience in Vegas dining was fantastic. Olives wait staff and bar staff were top notch. Very friendly and helpful and concerned with my food issues. I had the tuna carpaccio and the roasted chicken with green beans and olive oil mashed potatoes. It was all excellent. I will definitely be back here next time I am in Vegas. The mimosas were great too.
When we arrived we checked into the host stand and  they were kind and seated us in the main dining area near the bar. The patio was full but the bar was alive and busy. the noise was a bit loud but that can be expected in the area in which we were seated.. . The waiter seemed impatient and almost immediately grabbed the wine and drink list from us without making any suggestions. We had to ask for it back later and the same nonchalance was given. . The bread and olive pastes were exquisite!. . The meal: we received our dishes but one of our entrees came out cold and had to be returned to be reheated. Sea scallops were good and so was the onion soup but was not the very best but no complaints. The butternut ravioli which we were told was prepared in a unique and special manner was kind of alright. Not the best nor the worst either and for the price was not an excellent value.. . The banana tiramisu was delicious and espresso martini was heavenly to end our experience.. Overall this is kind of a good experience but I think I had higher expectations of the food and service that we're not met.
Made reservations beforehand. We were seated on time and got to sit in the patio. Great view of the fountains and the strip. Had the octopus as an appetizer it was really good. I ordered the salmon with risotto, it had a crispy skin that have it a crunch. It all tasted great. My bf had the gnocchi it was a bit sweet but still good with the goat cheese. Alsohad the tiramisu, prefect ending to our dinner. Definitely recommend, it was a nice restaurant and not as expensive as other nice places in Vegas.
Booked through OpenTable.  They had our reservation when we got there but they were over booked and we waited 30 minutes for our table.. . There were 4 of us and all ordered different things.  Beef tenderloin, cooked and seasoned perfectly at Medium Rare.  Surprisingly spicy sausage & ricotta ravioli.  Gnocci with pulled chicken was a bit bland and was drizzled with balsamic vinegrette that didn't bring much to the party.  And Chilean Sea Bass which was also cooked perfectly but a bit light on the seasoning.  We also got a flat-bread appetizer and 6 drinks among us.  For the most part the food was a strong 3 or a weak 4.. . We had a great time in spite of the issues which were: price $300, noise and lighting level (too dark, they have a cool back lighting device on the check folders so you can read the bill).  . . We will probably go back because it's so convenient with staying at the Bellagio.
Excellent spot for lunch (maybe dinner too, but we lunched there this time).. Good location in Bellagio arcade with patio dinning with a view of the Bellagio fountains display, but get there early or better book those tables early because they fill up fast.  For an appetizer we shared flatbread with prosciutto and fig- generous  portion and fabulous flavors.  Great wine choices and a variety of excellent main courses.   Service was superb without being overbearing.  Pricey, but a good value for the money.
Loved this place! It's so cute and our server was the sweetest. :) Ordered the olive burger added crispy prosciutto, capers and lemon aioli on the side.... Soooo delicious!! :)
