Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead.. . Okay, I would only maim someone over this pizza... not actually kill.. . To tell the truth, I wasn't expecting much when I laid eyes on boxes and boxes of this pizza floating down to the first floor of the Cosmopolitan, feeding hungry oafs watching the Super Bore game. Yes, I was one of the oafs trying to stay awake and hoping the game would pick up - shit, I was hoping that Elway (sitting in attendance) would jump in and take over for Manning.. . Anyway, the pizza looked a little "blah" and the pepperoni/sausage looked a little grey. Although, I now think it was just the lighting in the Chandelier Bar, where we were posted up. . After the friend and I shared a burrito from the mall across the street, and some very pricey "street tacos" from China Poblano (on the 2nd floor) - 3 dinky tacos for $16, I volunteered to go in search of this secret pizza place... why not? All the other oafs seemed to really enjoy this pizza. . . I will give you exact coordinates to find this pizza joint: 36.1100 N, 115.1753 W.... or just take the escalator, near the Chandelier Bar, up to the 3rd floor, make an immediate left off the escalator, stroll a few paces past the other restaurant, and veer to the right down the non-descript hallway which appears to be designated for employees only, or passage to purgatory. Tucked away is a little door to some pretty damn tasty and reasonably priced pizza. It's a tiny little spot, smaller than a Kardashian closet - no sitting area, just a couple of small bar tops where you can stand and scarf down.. . They sell pizza by the slice, whole pizza, and some kind of obscenely delicious looking fat/chicago-style pizza (but, you have to get your timing right to get your hands on one of these slices - may even be a special order thing). You can also add more toppings to whatever slice you choose. I nabbed a couple of pepperoni/sausage with bell peppers for myself and friend. Damn, I wished we knew about this spot earlier in the day - would have ordered a whole pizza. It was very, very tasty. Can't believe I wasted good $ on sub-par Chinese/Mexican tacos. . . I highly recommend this spot not only because the price is right, but this pizza is actually worth maiming someone over.
All we knew to look for was the hallway with all of the records. The "restaurant" itself is just basically a kitchen, an order counter, and a few tables to STAND at. And who cares!!!!! The owner served us our slices hot and fresh. The variety was amazing. The price was almost nonexistent. We took our slices out to the comfy and chic seating area in the atrium at The Cosmopolitan and STUFFED our FACES! So tasty. Slim but wide slices without all the dough, just the right amount of grease so I could imagine it would be ideal drunk food. They're open until some ridiculous hour like 4 am. Good thinking! I hope they're making a killing$$ I tell everyone going to Vegas they MUST try Secret Pizza!. . Every time we visit Vegas we research what we're going to do this time. Who wants to visit such a city and stay drunk and lose money the whole time? Secret Pizza came up in our research. Finding it at The Cosmopolitan felt like a treasure hunt, which is part if the fun!. . Ok. So the only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because it leaves no room for improvement. Businesses must always improve!
It was a bit hard to find this place but it was worth it. It's through a tiny alley entrance designed walls of music records, located in 3rd floor (above the day club) inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. You'll see the tiny hallway entrance as soon as you go up the escalator towards on the left side in between other restaurants. . . Any slice of pizza is good, affordable and medium size for a slice. The cannoli is pretty good too. It's really small space inside, only enough for few people to sit so be prepared to stand while eating. We went right when it opened so it wasn't too busy. But definitely worth the pizza and cannoli.
This is seriously a must stop in Vegas. We come here everytime we go to Marquee. So good especially after a night of drinking. I highly recommend ordering in advance and ordering a whole pizza to share so it's fresh and hot! Their garlic powder makes the pizza even better! We typically order the mushroom and sausage pizza. But all of it is good! . . No matter where you're staying in Vegas this is one place you have to eat at during your stay! We look forward to visiting everytime haha. . But beware, especially after clubbing and everyone is getting hungry is when the line gets long. The last time we waited like 30 mins for our pizza. It is definitely worth the wait though.
Secret?  Not anymore!  Lines of people down the hallway may give it away and if that doesn't , then follow your nose.   Every visit to Vegas I'm ready for this delicious slice, served piping hot with the toppings I love!  Go!  Enjoy! Yum!!!
***be aware if your buying a whole pizza*** . The pizza is not bad but is it worth the wait of 35 minutes for a whole one? That will be up to you
At the end of a walkway hall with records is some hidden pizza. This place has no signage and is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan. It's hidden... yet tons of people seem to be able to find this place and devour their pizza. Proof that if you offer something good, people will find you. . . I came here with my friend after watching Rose. Rabbit. Lie. I had one drink there... but it was sooo strong that it made me feel sick and I was in some dire need of some quick comfort food to ease my tummy.. . We looked for this place on the signs... none of which says Secret Pizza anywhere... so I looked on my trusted Yelp for clues. Like I said initially,  it's located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel. It's in a corner... but if you spot the pool tables (which are easily visible) the wall of records leading to Secret Pizza is right in front of it. . . The hallway is not too long... but it feels very exclusive/secret at you have to walk this hallway to get to it. Lol. The pizza place itself is very small with very few seats. My friend and I beat the crowd because we were able to get seats and have no line, well, only 2 people in front of me. After I got my pizza and came back to my friend who was saving seats... the place was packed! Even just standing it was packed!. . Anyways, as far as it being just one slice of pizza... the price was okay. I'm used to Costco's $2 slices haha. Here, they have pizza with the red sause (tomatoe) or white sauce. A cheese slice is $4.50, white is $5, or red with toppings is $5.50. I had a red slice with pepperoni,  sausages,  and mushrooms. The pizza was good!! Very tasty and the crust was cripsy. I loved it! A nice warm cheesy, crunchy, savory,  and tasty bite each time. The slices are pretty big... so for $5.50 it wasn't too bad! Of course I ate the whole slice and my stomach was satisfied. So glad we came here and got some pizza to counter the alcohol I was carrying in my stomach. It was the perfect counter to drinking in Vegas. Just beware that the slices are pretty greasy... so if you're worried about that, use napkins to soak up some before you eat!. . Service here was nothing special. Not good, not bad. Seating is bar style on 2 walls... but there's only like 5 chairs I saw? Definitely not enough for everyone to sit... the rest of your party will have to stand... ot take it out to the pool table area where there are a few couches around. Chili and permeasean cheese are out at the bar area along with napkins. They also have a pinball machine here! I'm not sure if it works as I didnt notice anyone playing it.. . This place is open all nigh, and late night too. So it's perfect after a night out in Vegas of drinking, dancing, partying. Its hidden.... but if all the stumbling drunk people can find it, then you can too!! 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan hotel near the pool tables... just follow the wall of records!
You're in Vegas. Whether it's for work or pleasure, in my case, work. You're craving something delicious, something cheap, and something filling. Pizza sounds good. Maybe it's 3:00am and you're leaving a club, and need to eat. Or, in my case, maybe it's 10:00pm and you're starving for dinner, and you just really want pizza. Whatever the case may be, take my advice. Head to the Cosmopolitan. Go to the third floor. Find all the restaurants, and the pool table. Find Secret Pizza down the secret hallway lined with music records. Eat. Be happy!. I have to admit, I didn't find this place on my own, or even through Yelp. I was sitting next to a really nice guy on the plane ride in, who told me I just HAD to try the pizza here. Best pizza in Vegas, he said. Is it? I can't judge that, because it's the ONLY pizza I've had in Vegas. However, it's one of the best pizzas I've ever had. I went with the white pizza. Absolutely the most mouthwatering slice I've ever had. Gobs of ricotta, perfectly crisp/chewy crust. Sprinkled with the (I think) garlic powder they have on the counter, and a little parmesan. I was in carb heaven and it was WORTH IT. Definitely will be back next time I'm in Vegas. Which will be next month. I'm already counting down the days till my next Secret Pizza visit.
Best drunk food ever! . . Walk out of Marquee on the third floor of Cosmo and you will see a small door entry to drunk pizza heaven!. . If you break it down, it is a simple pizza, similar to sbarro but the alcohol in your system make it taste so much better! . . The prices are a bit high, but after spending all that money while in vegas, whats 12 bucks for 2 slices of pizza. or $39 for a whole pie. . . Be prepared for long lines, drunk people and a very small cramped inside.
Sorry, can't give it 5 stars because I'm from NY. That's not snobbery talking, it's just fact. NYC has the best "NYC Style" pizza.. . That said, I acknowledge only 4 pizzerias in the country that are worthy of the "NYC Style" moniker. Pucci's in South Beach, Miami... Cazzola's in Coral Gables, Miami, Pin Up Pizza in Las Vegas and this. It's fun just trying to find this place. You'll know what i mean when you go there. It's open . . That's it. No reason to eat pizza anywhere else. ESPECIALLY CHICAGO!
Wow, best pizza I have ever had!  Check it out one floor above the entrance to Marquee and look for the line of people and the old school records in a blink-and-you miss it hallway.   There is not even a sign for the place.  The line stays pretty long all night, but it is so worth it!. . I tried the Meatballs and Ricotta cheese slice.  Unbefreakinleavable. . . Prices are reasonable at about $4.00-$6.00 for a large slice.  Customer service was great too.  Cooks were obviously working their butts off moving the line as fast as possible, but still having a good time and joking around with guests as they waited.  When some drunk guy tried to cut in line they kicked him out right away.  So satisfying when you see people working hard and not putting up with BS like that.. . Will definitely be returning, if I can find the dang place.
Great idea...not really secret but what else is open until 5am? Earl of sandwich is too far away if you are staying at the cosmo. The line is long at 3am but by 5am you don't wait too long for your pizza. It's very expensive $4-6 a slice?...but at that point...I don't think it matters.
Um I'm pretty sure all the good reviews are from people who are drunk. We waited 15 minutes for two slices of cheese pizza. It was cheap for the strip at $4.50 a slice but not even worth that. It was greasy and burned. Skip it.
Let's keep this in context and say this is the best fast food, drunk Pizza in the world. It's not Tom Colicchio pooping gold eggs here, folks. I'm sure Grimaldi's, which is in New York and fantastic I might add, would be less than happy if I, or let's just say someone I knew, stumbled in and wished to settle my debt for the food ordered with a fistful of one dollar casino chips. Secret Pizza, on the other hand, is properly trained and equipped to deal with these "free-spirited" individuals.. . Here's some questions one might have, that I will in part answer with questions:. 1. Would I take my sons and daughters here for pizza night? . Do you think it's still safe to leave your kids alone at Circus Circus with a sackful of quarters like your parents did when you were young? Do you live in Vegas? Why are your kids here?. 2. Should I bring Meemaw for a nice casual sit down dinner? Did Meemaw have mommy when she was 15? Is her sunrise tattoo on her lower back, now a sunset? Is she currently stumbling in her high heels after having spent the last 5 hrs inside Marquee living her missed youth?. . White Pizza; That's all.
The coke is $4 for a red plastic party cup. Enough said. I should've known though since this place was in Cosmo. The pizza was nothing special, and I felt like I could've gotten the same thing from dominos. It was soggy, greasy, and just meh flavored..
Sure it's busy, but that only means it's good. After a night out it's worth the stop. If Jazmin and Christo happen to be working then expect exceptional service! Quality pizza before hitting the bed always makes you feel better in the morning. ..or a few hours later. ;)
My favorite pizza in Vegas. It's on the strip, so it's expensive for pay-per-slice pizza, but it's great. The white slice is my favorite.
Pretty good for 3AM pizza. Knocked off a star because the slices were sweating off oils... (probably because we ordered all of the meats). Crust is on the thin side. Would come back when craving pizza in Vegas!
This pizza rocks in my opinion. I know, everyone has their own idea of good pizza and of NYC pizza and of thin-crust pizza etc... but it brings me right back to NYC everytime with the perfect ratio of crispy crust and oregano and garlic in the sauce. Its not the most convenient place when you just want a slice but I usually pick up a piece everytime I'm on the strip. Their homemade ricotta is to die for, and that's coming from someone who is not a cheese fan...
Okay, so I had to stop and ask someone for directions on where to find this place, and then, as I was walking down the record-lined hallway, wasn't too sure if I was in the right place.That's when I saw it - the pizza counter. About half a second later, the wonderful smell of fresh pizza hit my nose and, like a beacon, drew me in.. . Compared to the other places on the strip, this place is a dive. It's about as simple as you can get; pizza by the slice or pie, limited drinks (some beer) and red solo cups next to a water cooler. That's about it folks. The prices, though, aren't typical Vegas and certainly about the cheapest you'll find on the strip. I think I paid $6 for a "slice" of pizza. I say "slice" because this could easily have fed two of us (but it didn't, and I ate the entire thing!). . I'll definitely be coming back to this place the next time I'm in Vegas. Just keep it quiet.. there's just standing room only at the counter to eat, and I don't want to have to wait for a spot! :). . Enjoy!
Great  tasting pizza after a long walk along the strip! It's cheap, it's filling and it's tasty. Screw fine dining!!
Okay. Been there...done that. Quite possibly the greasiest pizza I've eaten since junior high cafeteria days. But it was good. If I was hankering for pizza, this would do!. . Smiley face
Wonderful pizza. I had it on four different occasions while staying at the Cosmopolitan. Really good stuff!
With the help of a security guard, I found the secret pizza place! . . Perfect for late night cravings and drunken satisfaction. I can't say how long I stood in line, but by the time I paid about 13 bucks for a slice and a solo cup coors light all was forgiven. . . Heaven. That is all.
This hidden gem is now one of my must go to places now when I'm in Vegas!   This is no name or sign to locate this place, you just have to ask around but you will just see a line of people waiting in a hallway, and now I know why and that it's worth the wait.  . . RICOTTA cheese, sausage, with white sauce!!!   This pizza is delish, the crust is amazing as well!   MUST TRY for everyone in Vegas!   Whole pizza $40 and the pie is ginormous, it was good for us 4 girls for 2-3meals!
The best pizza by the slice I've had in Vegas. Located on the third floor of Cosmo, there is no sign that says pizza, just look for the walkway across from STK that has random celeb pics framed. This is a Togo only pizza joint, so don't expect to sit around with friends and eat. I think I saw 3 chairs but I think they were only there for those that were waiting to pickup their phone orders. . . Ok, so the pizza was delicious. Thin slice, with thick crust, basic toppings- cheese, pepperoni, veggie, I believe they even had a pesto pizza. If your looking to pick up a whole pie, phone ahead.. . I ordered two slices and paid somewhere around $10, well worth it. Can't wait to go back. I love good, fresh pizza with real cheese and sauce, so this place met all expectations.
Not sure I would call this place a 'secret', but it sure is non-descript.  I never would have found it, or known to even look for it if not for Yelp.  It's literally a small pizza take-out counter at the end of a hallway with no signage whatsoever.. . The New York-style pizza was pretty good, but nothing mind-blowing.  Yet in a city where everything is overdone and getting something as simple as a cheap, fast, tasty lunch is hard to find then this place is great.  There is hardly any seating and just a small counter to stand at.. . They had a couple freshly baked options as we walked up, including a white pizza that my wife opted for and a special with hot peppers that looked good to me.
Excellent pizza. Delicious craft beer.  Take your slices to the lobby and sit and people watch outside of the pizza joint.  Take a whole pizza to go and become extremely popular. Win win.
My boyfriend said "this is the best pizza he's ever had in his entire life" and I agree. It really is a secret... A waiter from a previous restaurant told us about it when we mentioned we were staying at the Cosmo. I had a vegetarian salad and it was extremely fresh. The guy at the register was super friendly and super cute which only made my experience here better:) you have to ask a security guard where it is exactly....I honestly felt cool knowing about this secret:):)
I'm from New York, so I'm pretty judgmental about my pizza. . . This place does alright - if the pizza is fresh. If the pizza has been sitting out for a while the crust dries out super fast (not enough oil in the dough likely) and becomes way to hard. Basically the pizza is a 4 star slice when fresh or a two star slice when stale. Serviceable no doubt, but nothing special.
So greasy and delicious! Especially when it's 2am and you need drunchies. It's right outside the exit of marquee on the third floor. The white pizza is good,but way too rich to eat a whole slice. . . Beware of using the garlic shaker because it all pours out! So shake a little in your hand and add it on yourself.
It's easy to miss but anyone at the Cosmo should be able to help you locate it.  It's delicious for sure but wait can be a bit long.  It's great food, my favorite pizza joint in Vegas still.. . Super worth going here!  Plus it's in the Cosmo which is my favorite hotel space right now.
Just landed in Vegas and dead tired but you don't come to Vegas to sleep - you come to party...or eat. . . After the mess it took to check into our hotel, find our reservation, get to our room, etc., all we wanted to do was sleep but we were hungry and only had a limited time in Vegas to explore so we hit up this place. . . Secret Pizza is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmo across from the night club. Just look for all the drunk people stumbling toward this place and a narrow hallway with vintage records on the wall. . . Inside, this place is super tiny but the staff keeps you entertained with grand shows of spinning pizza dough etc. We were tired but fully awake after their friendly banter. Pizza isn't cheap but then again Vegas isn't exactly cheap so be prepared to pay $5 a slice. We each got the supreme with a variety of meats. Drinks are also expensive so we opted for water. . . Overall, there's a great selection of pizzas (and seasonings!) and you can see them being made fresh. It's open late for all your cravings.
Best pizza, period!! Its a hidden gem. If you are not looking for it you will walk past it. If ever at The Cosmopolitan, make sure you ask about the Pizza place. Restaurant has no name but everyone knows what you are talking about. The crust makes that pizza amazing. Ask for the deluxe slice, the white slice and a sicilian. The guys working there are all great guys. Chef Jay is the best. We will definitely be back whenever in Vegas, even if its for a couple slices.
So why is this place a secret? Because it's freaking hard to find late at night when you're trying to wander back to your hotel. XD.. . So how do you find it? Look for the rows of vinyl records on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo. Or better yet, follow the smell of cheese! . . The place is pretty small, no tables, 4 stools and a few pizzas that were premade. Each time I went, I ordered the white cheese pizza with pepperoni and meatball for $6! Each slice is pretty large so it should fill you up (think costco pizza). As for a whole pizza, it's about $30 plus.. . Overall, great pizza for cheap (for the strip). A super popular place once you're done with the club!
Had the thin crust meatball and sausage pizza. Delicious flavor and the crust is perfect. Big slices of meatballs with massive flavor.  Highly recommended to ask for parmesan to sprinkle on top. Solid slice for Vegas!
Great Pizza.  Slices are large and 5$.  The line can get absurd at night when the club (Marquee) starts to let out between 1-4am.  When I mean absurd, I mean like an hour wait to get to the register and order pre-made pizza.. . If you go during off hours (not lunch, dinner or after hours) you can go right up and get a slice.  This is probably the best quick pizza you can grab on the strip.. . Stay and play a round of pinball. ;)
So, this place isn't a secret.. . . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1dnqKGuezo. . You can read the plethora of reviews. that give a step for step to this delicious treasure.. . "It's ok, your secret is safe with me"  . . Great..now everyone is staring because i'm talking to my pizza.... . But in all seriousness,. . sober or sloshed. . best pizza on the Strip.
You guys are insane. This pizza is horrible. I came here with my group after hearing all the hype on yelp only to pay for over priced and over salted mall pizza. The service also left a bad taste in my mouth. Keep this pizza a secret.
great pizza, you have to stand to eat the pizza which is not a bad thing i guess. If you like to stand and eat pizza while drinking a  beverage talking to your mates this is a great place. Dont be deterred by the hoodlums you might encounter walking down the long hallway to the secret place. There is not a sign on the restaurant because its a secret! i would have guessed it was cash only...but its not.
