Total Northwest vibe. Soft woods mixed with industrial metal, high quality coffee drinks, pastries, quiche and hot food that are high quality and last but least a well-dressed, friendly, and professional staff.. . We sat and had coffee and various breakfasts, and hung out w/ no pressure to leave. Looking around I am already planning on heading back for a cocktail and/or glass of win later because the selection behind the bar looks nice.
I often visit this place to hunker down and do some work online. Its noisy, but comfortable. For a regular coffee, each size costs the same: $2. There are multiple rooms to settle down in, and it has a bar. The patio has no covering (Come on, Lux. This is Phoenix!), so if you sit out there during peak hours, the sun will slap you in the face. It's a friendly place though and they treat you like family. (wink). . Try a peppermint latte. Mmmm.
Finally had the opportunity to visit Lux after such a long time of trying! Wow I can't believe it took me so long. This is such a cool concept and I'm so glad that it's here in DTN Phx!  From when you walk in you can see this place is a coffee shop, bakery, beer and wine bar, and restaurant all in one. Oh almost forgot, just 1 huge hangout spot! I felt totally relaxed talking to a group of friend over drinks. . . I specifically ordered the green tea and it was suggested I try the pinnacle mango flavor and I'm glad I ordered it. Very yummy. Wife ordered the six shooter which she could only finish half way, talk about a Jolt!! Basically coffee with 6 shots of espresso! Might be good for late night cram or a cross country road trip.lol.. . I got a chance to walk around and there are lots of rooms where you can study or meet with people. Plus I saw a bar where you can sit in front off as well as a few couches. Overall this place rocks. Soon my favorite coffee shop in Phx. Reminded me of a modern day Willow House from back in the day!  I just wish I lived closer so I could actually call Lux my neighborhood coffee shop.
still dreaming the quattro espresso con panna...those whip cream was so rich and dense that the whole thing tasted more like affogato...i was tempted to have another one... :D. . the pastries looked sooo good that if we hadn't already had a big breakfast, i would have totally ordered a few...well...def next time!
In town from the ATL and this is a coffee shop that all hipster livings folks should visit.  $2 coffee with free refills....can't go wrong!!. . They do need more outlets in my opinion, though I found one within a few minutes. . . Next time I'm in town, Indian School Rd & Central Ave is where I'll be.
This place is a maze inside... And they kept changing up how they were taking orders so service is a bit confusing, but still friendly and quick. . . I tried this sort of crepe with mushrooms, butternut squash and arugula, it was savory and delicious! The coffee was great too.
Lux is amazing. Yes, it is "hipster". Yes, it is a bit "crazy". I am neither but I love the fact that it's not a cookie cutter chain or wannabe-chain. My lattes have always been perfect but what I didn't expect is the best biscuits and sausage gravy in town!
Chester came in around 7PM and the place was hopping. The experience started well when Chester was greeted by a svelte strawberry blonde. She sold him on a vegan cookie. It was made of oatmeal and surely some secret ingredient (CRACK) that made it taste so good. The adorable brunette with bangs got the drink out FAST which was good because there were a lot of impatient coffee "connoisseurs" waiting in line behind Chester. . . Chester thinks the adorable baristas made a poopy day much better. The girl up front gave him such a nice complement and didn't rush Chester like they do at Sh*tbucks. It's amazing what a smile and good cup of coffee can do for Chesters' mental health. Thank you, Lux lady. . . Iced coffee, service, people watching, and vegan cookies are very good in Chester's humble opinion.
The food was phenomenal!! It was a tad bit on the expensive side, but it was def the best breakfast steak I have ever had! If you like coffee this is the place to visit! I'm giving it 4 stars just because it was a little over priced. Other wise we would go back again!
Good coffee. Nice atmosphere. Rude employees. . Coffee was great and the food looked good too but the restaurant is super disorganized and confusing and the staff was rude.
A gem of Phoenix that rivals the best coffee shops in San Francisco and New York City.
Being from Baltimore, we don't have many coffee shops that serve alcohol as well.  I went with a friend who lived in the area for 6 years and raved about the place.  We didn't get to sit and enjoy the coffees, but we did get them to go.  . . Service was very fast.  Two iced Americano's were $6 total.  The vibe was very cool.  I loved the old typewriters on the tables.  Space was really big and a lot of people were studying/writing, etc.  The main room had a DJ and again, had a really cool vibe!  Will return if I come back to Arizona!
My whole family loves this place!  My recent discovery was a macchiato latte which was fabulous!  Daughter loves their pancake with fruit!  Everything here is good. We're certainly not hipsters, but feel very comfortable here!
UHHHH... don't worry about the hipsters. They're NOT the problem.. . I've been here a couple of times and I love the woodsy interior and exterior. I like the benches and mixed seating arrangement. I love the cushy chairs and internet connection is pretty strong. It kinda reminds me of Fourbarrel in San Francisco that I use to religiously frequent or Barbara's brewery in LA that I use to stop by after work to hangout and eat dinner at.. . However, my beef is that the crowd here is really mixed and mainstream-ish attracting Scottsdale types of people to try it out because they want to be "cool" too. I see dudes with slicked back hair looking all corporate but trying hard to be "laid back" by wearing perfectly pressed designer jeans. Man o man, that's retarded. Then there's a bunch of fat couples, mostly marrieds flaunting their togetherness that they're joined at the hip but they're having a "date night" and show that they too, can be "hip" like young, artsy, unmarried hipsters. BLAH. . There's a bunch of fat fakeass bitches wearing $200 workout outfits giving the appearance that they just came from the gym and that they lead an "active" and "healthy" lifestye when they're in full make-up, their hair looked like they stepped out of the salon, and they order the fully loaded mac n'cheese (with bacon and other artery clogging ingredients) and drink soda. WTF. The pretentious level of this is place is really up the hilt.. . I'm slightly disappointed because I love coffeeshops and I like the kind of people that tends to go to coffee places- introverted, intellectual, quirky types. The vibe of Lux would be much cooler if people didn't come in acting like it's a meat market. Having the guys not walking by and heavily eyeing every chick would be good. But then again, not having chicks wear tacky, trashy outfits like it's a 90s rap video would awesome, too. Some dudes have space issues where they stand a little too close in the line which is a bit too creepy for my tastes.. . Ok, so I'm from LA which is a very introverted city. Maybe I'm not use suburban ways. Maybe I am not familiar with people standing too close to me and looking at me in a gross undressing way. Could be many things. Or it's just that this place attracts some sleazy energy.. . I don't drink alcohol. I have a college friend here and when we hangout (which is not often) and talk, I'll have a beer with him. I don't mind nursing a drink to socialize with cool people I know. But on the whole, I prefer to drink coffee when I'm solo so I can get some work done and not feel like I've stepped in some club.
Lux is for hipsters.. but for hipsters that enjoy coffee. Here you can come and sit alone on your laptop, taking up a table for six - while looking sad in your solitude. Because that what I found. College hipsters that wanted to sit in their loneliness, but at the same time being seen - because whats more important than being seen right? If you just wanted to be alone, you could go to a dive bar.. but today's ideals thrives on attention. . . It is almost that if there was a coffee shop/laboratory where you could enjoy your beverage alone but in public display.. I am not even sure where I am going with this. It is sad though that people rather text than interact on person.. . The coffee bar has interesting elaborate concoctions with more or less actual coffee in them. You can have your coffee with milk, flavors and/or soda. That's how it is, and I had myself some nice big flavory cup of something that was sweet and caffeine laced. I would come back here, even if I do not understand the hype. here comes those who wants to experience the act of breaking the mainstream, but joining another mainstream movements that is almost as big as the original mainstream - but with even more rules and expectations. Complete culture fail - but you can bear witness of the unedgy alternative neophytes with their beginner beards and nervous lackadaisical doe eyes.. . Again coffee was nice. I like coffee. I hate mock cultures that is nothing but a fashion statement. I also am very skeptical against mixing coffee with root beer. That's just wicked and gnarly. But as its stated before, they have something for everybody and they realize that coffee is also for evenings and not just for the early pick-me-up. Kudos Lux.
A hipster dive. Better than Starbucks. Relatively inhospitable if you're not a hipster yourself.  Don't order food here -- just stick to coffee.
