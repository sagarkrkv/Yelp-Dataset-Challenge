We live in Agritopia and walk to Joe's frequently. The onion rings are some of the best I've ever had, and my wife is all over the fontina burger and sweet potato fries. You really can't go wrong with any burger, but I love the farm chicken sandwich. A lot of people like the BBQ chicken pizza and oddly enough the beet salad is really good, and even though my wife and kids are haters about the beet salad, I order it virtually every time. If you want a cool, unique vibe, with unbelievable food and a great outdoor setting for kids to run around and play...you can't beat this this place! Side note: everyone else in Gilbert knows this place kills it so from October-April plan on waiting about 30 in lone to order if you show between 5:45-7:00pm.
Excellent food and well worth the wait in line. The food was very tasty. Plenty of unique options on menu to order. There is both indoor and outdoor eating options. More room outside on picnic benches. Very reasonable prices and good food. We will be back.
The only thing that is keeping me from giving this place a 5 star is that the lines are way too long. . . I first heard of this place through watching Food Network on Guy Fieri's show, 'Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives'. The onion rings that were featured on the show looked absolutely delicious. I also liked that the place was not too far from my house and everything they had came from their own farm- hence the name.. . Upon arriving to the location, it was near a suburban community and right next to a little farm where you can pick your own vegetables. I was surprised at how green and cookie-cutter perfect the neighborhood was. There also appeared to be a lot of people since the paved parking was full and I had to go to the dirt lot. The place looked popular enough, so it couldn't kill to pave that parking space.. . The architecture of the place seemed really funky, but fitting for the scenery. A huge downside though was that I came at the lunch rush so there was a line that spread all the way to the outside of the restaurant. That was my first indication that the place must be really good. However, after waiting 20 minutes, I was starting to doubt if it was worth it.. . Boy was I in for a treat. I decided to order their 'Farm Burger' with bacon and mushrooms, which was an extra dollar for both and their infamous onion rings. Looking at how pricey things were getting, I opted for just a water cup. I was given a buzzer to notify me when my food was ready. I had the choice of sitting inside or eating outside, and I chose sitting outside since it was a nice day. On the side of the restaurant is a counter where you can get all your drinks, condiments, and dipping sauces. There was even a hand washing station where I could wash my hands, which was a huge plus.. . I decided to sit underneath the huge tree in the middle. Once I was settled, I was happy to find that my buzzer was beeping and I could go get my food. Once I got my food. I realized that for the money I was paying, I was given huge portions. I put the vegetables that was separated in the burger and took a bite. Let me say that this was probably one of the next burgers I have ever tasted. Juices were running down my hands so you know it was good. I couldn't get enough of it. Finally once I got off my momentary food high, I took a bite out of one of my onion rings. I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy what seemed like Rosemary in the seasoning. I savored every bite to the last crumb.. . Overall, it was a great experience. I want to come back and try their other burgers. They always seem to have a special everyday, so I want to try that one day as well. I highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a great family-friendly restaurant and fantastic burgers and onion rings.
Haven't had a bad experience yet!  The line can get long, but that's a sign that they are doing well.  The line was the longest part.  Once we ordered, it took less than 10 minutes to get our food.  So from getting in line to getting our food was 40 minutes.  Not bad for a Saturday evening dinner.. . The onion rings are out of this world.  Crispy, flavorful, and the onion actually stays inside the ring when you take a bite out of it.  Definitely a family favorite!  Highly recommend.
My girlfriend and I came hire for the first time. The line was long to get in, the food was well worth the wait. I would recommend ordering the cheesecake first. The cheesecake was what I would say is the best I've ever had
I LOVE this place, but I have to be in a patient mood to eat there.  The lines  are always so incredibly long, but that's just a testament to its tastiness.  I usually get the salmon, which comes with multiple sides.  The piece of salmon is so large and there are so many sides that I can never eat more than half of the meal.  The burgers here are amazing, and who can deny the amazingness of the BBQ?  It's the same stuff as Joe's Real BBQ, so if the line at one place is too long, go to the other one!  . I love the air powered condiment dispensers and apparently the bathroom decor has been listed in top ten restaurant bathroom lists before. (If the decor of the bathroom at a restaurant is actually important to you!)  Come at off-peak hours for fast service and ample eating space.
Used to eat here often, especially since it has outdoor seating and is family friendly. The Fontina Burger and Tuna Burger were our favorites. We stopped going here after we saw that Joe's hosted a fundraiser for a local Tea Party candidate that featured none other than the Queen of Mean herself--Sarah Palin. So this may bolster Joe's reputation for those of you who love Right-Wing politics, but for us, it was a huge turn-off. We would rather spend our money on local businesses who put their funds into Progressive candidates or simply back into the community.
This place has great food and a fun atmosphere.  We love taking friends and family that visit is from out of town.  There is indoor and outdoor seating too.  . . The line can be very long and slow at times, but the food is worth the wait.  . . Make sure to get a milk shake.  They often have unique flavors during the different seasons, like pumpkin, strawberry, banana, etc.
Love this place. Spent both Saturday and Sunday there. All self serve but it works and the food is fresh and the veggies are grown onsite. Veggie pizza was pretty amazing but the fontina burger left me craving yet another visit!
I don't know why so many are crazy for this dive.  I have eaten lunch there many times when working in the area.  The food is good, but not remarkable.  The line to get in the place is insane - way too long and way too slow - which is the reason for my 2-star rating.  I've yet to find a restaurant worth waiting this long in line for - this one included.  The decor is definitely low class dump.  The dining room ispacked at lunch, often with screaming kids.  There is seating outside, but the Arizona summer makes this downright dangerous.  Joe's is best if can do an early lunch and I mean EARLY.  Getting there at 1130 doesn't cut it.  Try 1045 or 1100 unless you like wasting your lunch hour standing in a line out the front door.  Eat there if you must, but there are many other better options within a couple of blocks.
