Great buffet. Would have liked wine to have been included for the price, but soft drinks/coffee/tea were. The buffet was gorgeous. Very high quality food. Lots of meat, seafood, vegetable, ethnic, and dessert choices. Not overly crowded at 5pm. Service from waiters not so great. They cleared plates well but did not refill water and tea.
My wife and I just ate here for lunch based on a recommendation from a local. This is one of the worst buffets I've tried in Vegas. The food was less than mediocre, and in most cases barely edible. Breads were stale and dry, flavors of most things seemed bland and cheap, and a platter of "fresh" burgers just put out were already cold. Avoid this buffet and spend your money elsewhere!
Decent place to have dinner. However, I'd say the buffet at Wynn is much better for a slightly moreexpensive price. The crab legs are watery, but the dessert selection is great.
Wow anything and everything u could ask for is here and it's all very good. One plate I had pizza and wings and my next trip I got sushi how cool is that. A little pricey butt if u have a big appetite its money well spent
First dinner at Vegas -- we decided to head over to this buffet. $42.86 per person on a Wednesday night (including tax). We made reservations ahead of time since I was traveling with a 40 people group, but the line was not that monstrous at 8:00 p.m.. . Although the selection was not as vast as I envisioned it to be, the food was still of excellent quality. The miso baked fish was so good. Other dishes that left an impression were the prime rib, salmon/tuna poke, and pesto tortellini. Oh my god, the poke. I have never tasted ahi tuna this delicious. I've definitely been missing out all my life.. . The dishes are replaced pretty often, and everything tastes fresh.. . They have a good array of desserts, some of my favorites were the banana foster (hint of alcohol flavor) and the creme brulee. Their cheesecakes were okay, and the soft serve melts pretty quickly. By the time I had walked from the dessert bar back to my seat, I already had a pool of vanilla around my rapidly melting ice cream.. . Great buffet! Can't wait to try out some of the others around the Strip.
Worst buffet I ever been too in my whole life! Was really disappointed! Nothing had flavor and everything was dry!
I loved this buffet.  I went on a Tuesday evening for dinner and it was great.  All the crab legs i could eat.  Nice plump shrimp, not that cheap peel and eat kind like they have at some other buffets.  I also had some of the prime rib... again, great.  Even the deserts were pretty good.  I definitely will be returning to this buffet when i get back in town.  I had to wait a while in line to get in but it was well worth it.
Overall, the buffet was fantastic.  I did find the pork ribs to be a little dry..
Taking into consideration the cost, I give it a two. I think the quality of the food has gone down since my last visit here and the price has gone up at least 25%. I didn't take any pictures because the place was crowded with patrons trying to put food on plates. Would I go back? Probably not, not saying it was bad, just not for me. Maybe I just outgrown it... Lol
Very disappointing. Expensive & nothing special. While they did have caviar, something we haven't found elsewhere, nothing else impressed us. Also the service was subpar. Not only was our waiter unattentive, the lead hostess was making snide remarks about guests, and when we needed service & asked for help from other servers they simply said "we cannot help you, that's not our section". We will not be coming back here ever again, especially having paid over $90 for 2 people.
If you enter Bellagio through the garage entrance, your senses are immediately greeted by a sweet scent. As you walk in further, both your eyes and smell experience the most beautiful and colorful mix of lilies, hyacinth, and other annuals.. A beautiful butterfly garden accompanies your garden visit.. On your walk to the buffet, you see marble floors and walls galore. Gold layering accents and pools fit for monarchs.. The wait was nonexistent and depends what time and day you go. Although you would think 5 pm Sat would be a wait. It wasn't due to what I observed. hard working individuals from the cashier to the hostess and shift manager who visibly were on task, not distracted with other things and making it their priority to maintain a rhythmic flow of happy guests. My waiter Alfonso was very busy but you can see how hard they work day in and day out to serve thousands of people from all over the world to survive. They will gladly bring you more beverages or coffee if you request.. There's an overabundance of food choices and chefs are readily available to suggest and inform what they like best for example between prime rib and beef roast. You will also find crab legs sliced lengthwise so you don't worry about cracking them. If you have kids, there's pizza, and the cheesiest Mac n cheese on cute white ceramic miniature bowls. Greek foods, salads and not to mention the desserts galore that include sugar free. Sushi, Italian,list goes on.. It is a bit pricey ($43 minus tip) however, the experience is either you're as close as you can get to food nirvana or  in Vegas baby!. So, go ahead and indulge your palate and awaken your senses at the Bellagio Buffet.
Read all the other reviews, the ones that say it's a good place are right.. . Come here for lunch at a reduced price and you will love yourself for it. You pay $22.99 for lunch Monday - Friday 11:00am - 3:30pm, $33.99 for dinner Sunday - Thursday 3:30pm - 10:00pm. . . All sorts of other options and bigger prices, but save the $11 and come at lunch.. . I focused on favorites: Alaskan King crab legs and prime rib with delicious mashed potatoes. I did some sushi [nice], shrimp, some Kobi beef [too dried out] and roast veggies, but stuck to my favs. Lots of crab. Lots of prime rib. Heaven.. . So now after some serious meat sweats and a breather: dessert in the desert. Nice little creme brulees, individual pies and cakes with good coffee. Insulin please, Mr. Von Bulow. That's a lot of sugar.. . Thank goodness this is a 5 hour flight or I would weigh 350 lbs. . . I've been to a lot of places for buffets in Las Vegas, this is good.
I went out for dinner with my wife and two friends of ours on Sunday. We read online about the caviar bar on the weekends and the all you can drink margaritas, sparkling wine, bloody Mary and beer for an additional $11.99. We were looking forward to a nice dinner at a reasonable price for four teachers. . . We were ushered to the cashier. We told the cashier lady that we would like to add the $11.99 alcohol option and she responded roughly saying "YOUR server takes care of that." My wife and our friends just looked at each other as if we said something to offend her. It's not our problem if the cashier has to clarify the details to customers. It's part of her job to make every customer understand any questions they might ask about her place of employment. Not a good first impression, GRADE: F. . We paid, we're seated, then our waiter (Alfredo) came and ask what we would like to drink. We told him all of us would like the alcohol option and started to order margaritas and ask if he could bring us wine after the margaritas. Then he pointed out that we can only make one choice between the four alcohol options. Alfredo was apologitic and made other beverage suggestions which was nice of him. He is a good employee who tried to protect the company. But to me, my wife and our two friends, this is deceptive marketing. I don't think we were the first to be fooled and definitely won't be the last. All four of us canceled the alcohol option and ordered ice teas. Alfredo then let us know that he was going home and Richard was going to take care of us. Our new waiter Richard was attentive and made sure our drinks were always full. Not a good second impression because of the misleading advertisement but Alfredo and Richard made up for it. GRADE: B. . Then all four of us went to get some appetizers. We searched for the caviar bar but we're unable to find it. I asked a person next to me if she knew where the caviar is and she said she's also looking for it. We both approached a lady who was working in the sushi section and asked where the caviar bar is. She said it's only on Friday and Saturday.  So we both said that we thought it's served on the weekends and Sunday is a weekend.  The lady in the sushi section replied to us, "yes, the weekends but not on Sunday." More misleading information. Not a good third impression, GRADE: F. . I told my wife and our two friends that not only were we mislead about the alcohol option but also the caviar bar on weekends. All four of us quickly finished our meals, gave a 20% tip and left.. . Price = average for a strip resort.. Cashier = not acceptable, poor front line customer service.. Our waiters Alfredo and Richard = above average.. Food = average, nothing stood out.. Advertisment = not acceptable, misleading tactics.. . . Overall = Two stars, one for Alfredo, one for Richard. Will not come back, the deception left a bad taste. Will definitely use this experience in future class projects.
For those who want to see what kind of food that are served at Bellagio, I have recorded a Full Slow and Steady tour of Bellagio Buffet in crisp HD. This video was shot  couple of months ago. or go on YouTube and type "Full Delicious Bellagio buffet tour" and you will see my video. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeixPh5mCI8. . I had an opportunity of dining at Bellagio buffet for the second time. We ate for dinner during the holidays rush, so we had to pay close to $55 per person.. .  This time was actually pretty good and had a lot of varieties of food to choose from. . . I have never had beef wellington before, I've only heard and seen it on Hell Kitchen, but man it was moist and good. . . They even had Pho. It was blend, but eatable. . . They even had Alaskan King Crab Legs, which is the most expensive crab legs out there. I spent most of my time, eating the King Crab legs and not the Snow crab legs since you can find snow crab legs for dinner at every buffet in Vegas.. . I didn't get any sushi, but man, the lines were looong to get some made to order sushi roll.. . Deserts were abundant. They even have Macarons. I saw one diner got a whole plateful of Macarons, I'm assuming they going to stuff that into their purse to take home.. . Service was good. Server kept clearing the plates quick.. . Overall, it was a pretty good dining experience.. . Like I said before, if you guys want to see what kind of food are served at Bellagio, check out my video below or go onto YouTube and type "Bellagio Buffet" and you are likely to see my video on top of the playlist.. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeixPh5mCI8
my favorite regular buffet love the kobe beef and the mash potatoes ! and they have a good amount of desserts here.
Had the breakfast buffet for 2 @ 30$ per person. I would have liked drinks to be part of the package. . . Some of the items were good but they don't make any customizations at all. Food is already pre-prepared.. . The ceviche and other seafood options were bad.
The food is generally good, but very rich. I tried a lot of different things, but wasn't particularly impressed by the buffet. While it was relatively cheap, it was too expensive for the type of food served. . . We paid about $36 each including tax. It was a good first time experience and if you have the cash you should try it. I wouldn't go there again merely because of the cost.
If you like over priced dining experience, you found the right place.. . Price: Over priced for what you get. If you have kids 4 and up, they'll get charged full adult rate. . . Selection: The food was just OK. Seriously nothing special. Standard meat, seafood and salad... I would have paid $10 at most for what I got. Oh and if you want some assortment 0f dessert, keep walking. This place doesn't come close to Wicked Spoon. Save yourself some money and avoid this place. . . Service: Slow as do just matter of fact. . . Conclusion: I would never come here again.
We went there on a Wednesday night, and not only did we have to wait over an hour in line, but they didn't have too many main-course vegetarian options, like tofu, veggie meat, loafs, etc. And a vegan definitely couldn't eat there, cause they'd have just fruit. Much of it was meat & side dishes to go along with the meat. I don't think i'd pay $36 again to eat overly-rich pasta, pizza & dessert, as a vegetarian. I probably ate about $5 worth of food, if that. The food was nicely presented though, and the staff friendly. They can't accommodate so many people in a timely manner. It's like a circus. I wouldn't go back because it's expensive, food options are limited for vegetarians, & takes WAY too long to get in.
BIG 4 BUFFETS ON THE STRIP. . I came here yesterday for dinner. This buffet is considered one of the Big 4 Buffets on the Strip: Bacchanal, Wynn, Wicked Spoon, and Bellagio. Including Bellagio I went to three of them. Last night was the first time I went to the buffet at Bellagio. I learned from my previous buffet there's a strategy when you eat at buffets. You need to approach them as if you're eating at a tapas eatery - get three items on a plate. I ended up having 8 plates. Instead of naming every item I ate I will mention the highlights. The chorizo sausage and pork and chicken sausage were tasty. The smoked salmon, ceviche, and calamari salad were fresh and clean. The prime rib was cooked rare to my liking. The baby back ribs had a sweet glaze taste. The chocolate and vanilla eclairs were light and sweet. The rice pudding was also a nice filling for desert. There were three things I didn't like. Even though the pepperoni pizza came out of the oven the crust was chewy not crunchy. I found the snow crab legs to taste a little salty. I wish they served the bones of the prime rib. They're the tastiest part of the prime ribs. Overall The Buffet at Bellagio is a decent buffet. In terms of the Big 4 Buffets at the Strip (I haven't been to the Wynn yet) I would rank in order Bacchanal Buffet, Bellagio, and Wicked Spoon (at this buffet I went at the worst time on Saturday brunch and may go back at a better time).
I went here for dinner on a weeknight about 6pm which was good because the line grew like a radioactive beast after that!  I was only in Vegas a few nights and wanted to make sure and try a buffet before leaving.  It wasn't bad and cost about $40 with tip.  It was too late when I saw the all you can drink offer for $12, that would have been worth it.  Food wasn't bad, it was good quality.  This just wasn't all the grandeur I had heard about Vegas buffets.  Someone told me that Caesar's Palace had the best but I can't confirm that myself.
Soooooo good and I don't even like buffets. Great food, most of it was very fresh and that which didn't appear to be was quickly replaced with newer stuff.. . King crab legs, ahi tuna poke, and beef Wellington were tasty. Dessert was delectable.  The creme brulee and cheesecake were light and just sweet enough.. . The only complaint was a lack of chocolate chip cookies and the jacked up price for Easter.. . This is worth the money, even if they took advantage of holiday travelers.
I'm trying to figure out why this Buffett only has 3 and a 1/2 stars.. I went this morning 4/20, for their brunch and yes it is pricey $38 per person, but it was WELL worth it. Let's put it this way, your going to pay at least $35, for a good meal in Vegas (unless you like eating cheap and you don't buy alcohol) Why not make your spending worth it. . . The pro's. -great selection and fresh food.. -omelette station.. - turkey sausage (I don't eat beef or pork so seeing turkey was like a dream come true.). - red velvet waffles, if you haven't tried it, you HAVE to.. - variety, pasta, crab legs, breakfast, many choices.. - great service, my waitress had the orange juice refills ready, before I could ask.. . The con's. -fruit selection was minimum, no pineapple, no berries, but had your basic, melons, strawberries, oranges and bananas. . - mimosa cost $12!!?!? Really, I just spent enough money to almost fill up my gas tank for a week and now I have to pay for a mimosa. . . . Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Bellagio's buffet, it was delicious. I like good food and variety. It was not over or undercooked, the food had flavor and was very fresh and the service was great!
I was exited to try this buffet what a disappointment. . . Sushi - Rice was hard and fish not fresh. . Kobe Beef - Just tough and chewy. I could not finish it.. . Braised Short Ribs - Salty . . Spring Rolls - Hard and I could not chew them. . Pork Buns - Dry and salty. . I will just stop there. It was a a huge disappointment. Nothing really stood out and wowed me. This was my last Vegas buffet. My best meal this trip to Vegas was . Jack In The Box when I was leaving town. If you offered me this buffet or fast food I would go with the fast food.
Really disappointing and really doesn't live up to the Bellagio image or standards.  Waited 10 minutes to even see the waitress; she brought us our coffee and waters and never was able to get a 2nd water so spent the second half of the meal with nothing to drink.  The food......maybe its because it was the breakfast buffet, but it was about as bland and gross as bad buffets get.  The desserts were decent, the rest was forgettable and disappointing.
Yelp should really enable half stars cuz this is 1.5 stars. Bellagio buffet is also rated among the top ten buffets in Vegas. Who are these people rating these ?. Very mediocre food. No taste to anything. Really. The sushi bar is a joke. The meats are flavorless and bland. The seafood is average at best. The pizza and other Classic American fare is...yaaawn. Enough said.. Save your money and appetite. Stay away from these overrated buffets.
This review is based solely on our most recent visit 27April2014 to this Buffet.  Being a Las Vegas Local I expect much more for the amount of money we spent to eat here. My wife and I decided to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary and  treat ourselves to "something a bit fancier" than the local casinos have to offer.  I read the reviews prior to going and still made a conscious decision to take my wife here. Shame on me as I was forewarned. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by a Hispanic host who was just shuffling people. No greeting, no "welcome"..no nothing. Just a "how many?".  After paying approx $78 for 2 of us, we were seated in a back corner by a lady who appeared to be from the African continent based by her accent.  This seating area ad a really bad stench in the area. I immediately asked if we could move to another area and pointed to much better lit and cleaner area. She was very blase and stated "that area is closed!".  She didn't offer to seat us elsewhere..she just continued on to the next group of people. . . After being seated we headed to the food counters and found a delightful assortment of food. With my mouth watering, I began to pile on the food to take back to our unacceptable booth. The food was lacking with that "POP" of flavor that one would expect when paying this much for dinner! The food was bland, merely warm, and after 20-30 having dinner I felt nauseous for a couple hours. I want to make it clear this was not from over eating!!  To sum it up, the executive chefs at this buffet who over see the quality of the food are not worth a damn. Shame on them for letting crap be served to tourists and visitors that come to our beautiful city and then leave with an experience as my wife and I experienced. We will not be going back.  By far, this buffet should NOT be on the top 10 list to try. I understand that the next persons experience may be different due to different people working different shifts...but the lack of quality to the food...there is just no excuse.  I truly feel bad for someone vacationing here, spending so much jus to eat, and going back to their home thinking of a negative experience of our city.
It hurts me to give The Bellagio Buffet 1 star, but the food was absolutely horrible. If my husband says the food was bad then it was bad. I had to ask for a fork 3 times because every fork I received was dirty with either dried food and soap scum! The rotisserie chicken was drier than a sponge, the homemade mashed potatoes taste like they were made with spoiled milk and the beef brisket looked like a patio desk, it was completely dried out. . . For $49 at The Bellagio, I expected mouth watering selections and got the total opposite. So if you're hungry and don't care about the taste and it's convenient, then enjoy, but I just wasted $50. . . Oh and no Crab Legs until 3:30pm and no creme brulee, I'm SO done. The buffet at The Paris hotel tasted MUCH better than The Bellagio. Only gave this review one star because I had to and that goes to the poor waitress Cici! Thanks for a HORRIBLE last meal in Vegas. I won't be back and I do NOT recommend.
I am trying to understand the hype for this buffet. After missing out on it each time we go to Vegas, I finally got my way and we went to Bellagio Buffet. WTF is the hype about? The place is dirty and disorganised, the buffet choices are limited, we were expecting a wide range of choices, buthonestly I have been to better buffets on and off the strip, with a better international variety and fresher foods. This place was a big let down.
We had high expectations of the buffet of a reputed casino like Bellagio. Unfortunately the food was average. There was nothing exceptional really. I wouldn't waste my time going back to this buffet, even if it was considerable cheaper. We had to decide between Bellagio and Caesar's palace and I regret going with Bellagio since we are in town only for a couple of days.
In this buffet the quality of the food is unquestionable. Flavor and presentation of each option offered is their priority. All the dishes are prepared with the highest quality ingredients.. . The presentation and set up of the different stations are two other things that they are carefully done and maintained during the day. Chefs are constantly making sure  everything is still in place and to restock items that are low in the stations.. . As for the service, to be honest, it is a little bit standoffish.. . Read my extended review in my blog: http://lagamio.com/2014/04/29/le-village-vs-the-buffet/
Came here several times and I think it's OK. IDK why people think it's so great.  The quality of food wasn't anything special.  And the waitresses always looked like they didn't want to be there.  Well, then I don't want to either!
Expensive but very good food.
Come here, get stuffed, go back to the hotel and sleep. That's the right way to start your day in Vegas!! . . My boyfriend, his parents, and I came to The Buffet at Bellagio on a late Sunday morning (around 11am). The buffet goes until 3pm, is $35 per person (includes non-alcoholic drinks), and expect to wait about 20+ minutes just to order and sit. This buffet is decent -- not bad, not great either. . . Sure, there's enough food and different food options to feed an army of people with different food preferences and interests. There's everything from sushi, to french toast, to salad, to desserts, to getting any cut of meat your heart desires. But, the food isn't *that* good. Sure, I filled up on two plates full of food plus dessert, but when I left, I quickly forgot about my food. I also ordered an OJ, a coffee and some water. . . Service here was "meh". The server seemed distracted and distant. Sure, it's a buffet and I get my own food....but when I'm paying $35, I expect them to be on top of drink orders and clearing the table quickly, neither of which I particularly thought they were. . . Overall, just an A-OK place. I'd consider coming back here on future Vegas trips, but it's nothing to write home about.. . Cheers!
