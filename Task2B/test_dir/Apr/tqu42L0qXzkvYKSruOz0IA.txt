Excellent food, beer and gaming. The food and drink prices are super cheap. The steak meal was amazing. They also have a cool karaoke bar.
Try the Players Card 8.99 steak special.  Best green beans I've ever had. Good steak,  great prime rib option too.
Went to Vegas for the NAB Show 2014 and was told by cabbie to try it out. Read several reviews describing EI as 'Old School'. It was a fun eating gambling and drinking experience. $2 beers, $8.99 steak dinner and mix in good friends and a great time was had by all. Go, it's worth the trip!
Great inexpensive place for breakfast. We stayed at the Bellagio and two coffees and two bagels was $22.00! Heard about Ellis Island- short 14 min walk from the hotel. Great All American breakfast firm two about $29.00. Absolutely worth the walk.
Oh Ellis Island, the name and the location say it all. It's not classy, it's not fancy, it's vegas bargain and foodie delights all wrapped into one! I can always count on delicious steak and eggs with some of the best potatoes i've ever tasted always available 24-hours a day. I have had lunch here once too and it was equally good. Somebody said that this place was Jankey and it is and I love it! Thanks for fulfilling the need of food after long questionable nights in vegas.
If you're looking for cheap but good food, a friendly staff and a no bling casino, this is the place. I went there for the $8.99 steak dinner but stayed to gamble a bit and was not disappointed. The cut of meat was delicious, I ordered mine medium to medium rare, and they did it perfectly. The split pea soup was homemade and included meat from ham hocks(!), and the mashed potatoes and gravy were yummy. Throw in a 20 ounce beer brewed on site and it's the deal of the century. I had so much steak left over (I'm a small eater) I took it back to my room and the next morning 4 of us shared it as a snack. I signed up for their players card and got my $10 free play which was parlayed into a small winnings that covered the cost of dinner with some change left over. The staff was friendly at the bar and restaurant. We didn't stick around for the karaoke but everyone there said it was usually a good time.
Myself and my group of friends had heard about karaoke and we just had to check it out, it was my friend's birthday and we were excited to have some fun. It was loud, packed and pretty crazy, but that was the fun part. What wasn't fun was telling the waitress I wanted one drink: our party had ordered 4 appetizers along with beers, and I'm sure she was extremely busy and overworked, but when someone asks to pay for ONLY their drink to leave and work at 6am, ends up waiting another 30 minutes for the drink check and her card returning with the full amount of the bill and nothing but your word that "there's a 5$ minimum so I put the whole bill on there without your permission", fun stops there. I won't be returning and I realize that if I want to have a decent time, I'll stay the hell away from the lazy people at Ellis Island who charges just so they don't have to split up a bill and who don't even have the decency to inform you how much they're putting on your card. I'm entirely sure that's illegal as well.
It's a dive casino. I wasn't expecting too much as far as dinner goes. We were drinking and needed some food. We stopped at the cafe but it was full. Little did I know there's a new BBQ joint in there. The host was playing it up as the best!! Hard to imagine but we went for it anyways. Holy hell!! It was delicious. For $11.99 I got 1/2 a chicken, 1/2 rack of ribs, whole corn on the Cobb, loaf of garlic bread, cole slaw and beans. It was served on a platter. I couldn't eat that much if I tried but ohhhhh we tried. I was amazed and would actually drive there just for that food again. Loved it!!
Much to my surprise it was actually quite difficult finding a good karaoke spot in Vegas on a week day. We looked around and saw Ellis Island was having karaoke on Wednesday night, so we figured we give it a shot. The cab driver kinda laughed when he picked us up at the Hard Rock Hotel and we said that's where we wanted to go. . . The casino is a total dive. Dim lighting inside with an overwhelming rush of smoke. We got there early so we decided to have dinner in the bar while we waited for the show. Turns out the food was fantastic! Probably the cheapest and best food we had the whole time in Vegas! I ordered a club sandwich and my boyfriend had fish & chips. The portions were huge and very reasonably priced and delicious. . . Luckily we got there early because this place packs up! Seems like it was the type of bar where alot of locals like to hang out, so we felt right at home. The service... sucked. We had to go up to the bar and wait a long time to order a drink but at least they weren't overpriced. The karaoke crowd is a very appreciative bunch and we had a blast!
It was suggested I try this place out by a foodie friend. If it wasn't for him, I would have not dared venture here. . . Upon parking, it seemed like I was entering a seedy motel off the strip. It's on Koval Rd. off of Flamingo. Entering the place, there were old people smoking and drinking and a bunch of bikers. Sort of like something out of a movie set where they'd murder you and throw your body out in the dumpster. Scary.... . Finally found the brewery in the back and was anxious to try their half fried chicken and beer. What I discovered was fantastic! A whole half of a chicken was freshly coated and fried. So tasty and crispy! Came with some fries and a pickle. There was so much chicken I couldn't finish it all. Then came a 16 oz beer for...wait for it...under a dollar! You could pick any of their brews. I don't remember the name of the brew I picked but it was a tasty dark stout like brew.. . There are other amazing foods on their menu, such as fresh sandwiches and hot entrees. All for under $10.00. My chicken plate was only $5.99! A super steal for a great meal. Don't be scared by the demographics of the customers here. The food and restaurant was nice and clean. No one mugged me or bothered me, and my rental car wasn't stolen in the end.
This update is for the BBQ restaurant. I had the ribs & chicken combo, which was very good. Loved the BBQ sauce, and the meat was served hot!. They are generous with side dishes- beans, cole slaw, corn AND garlic bread. All for $11.99- can't beat that! . Beer is $2.25, a quarter more than at the bars. Very noisy on the Tuesday evening we were there.
We love the rack of ribs as we have been going here for years and they just get better and better!  Great price, tender baby rack ribs and house made Root Beer!  YUM!  We visit quite often and glad to say their service is fantastic as well! This is a casual place where you can relax and get your fingers dirty with some really good BBQ.  It is a small place so we advise getting there early before they fill up.
Place has yummy food at dirt cheap prices.  Need I say more?  . . The IPA was pretty good, too.. . Skip the big hotels restaurants and buffets, take a walk and come here.
Back again on Sunday! OMG just as delish as ever! My all time fave BarBque!! The ribs melt in your mouth! Beans are good cole slaw good! What more can I say! Oh $13.99...WOW!!
