Don't go I have been coming here for the last 7 years and it used to be good but since the bank took it over it is horrible don't eat here and don't risk a night to stay here
I must say I expected a bit more... Overall, its just "okay" here. We stayed here because it's so close to the convention center. You can either walk or take the monorail. The staff at the check in/out counter were very friendly which was welcomed after such a long wait in line each time. We stayed for a week.. . **There is NO FREE WIFI!!!**. Do not be decieved! It costs PER device PER day!. . We paid extra for a "strip view room" but all we could see was the monorail and the Rivera. Furthermore this hotel needs an update especially the room's bathrooms. The dim lighting and that 70's pink tile made my skin crawl. The casino is nothing spectacular but it has all the games. There is no shuttle service that runs regularly to and from this hotel and airport... so plan accordingly.  . . There are a few food options within the hotel. We ate at the burger resturant. It's was again "okay". It was a bit busy but it only seemed to have 3 servers working so patience is key. We also ate at the buffet for lunch. There are a few good options.  The only plus to me was there was free beer and wine ;)..  . I am not very likely to stay here again bc of the convience of the monorail to better yelp rated, comparable hotels in the area is simply too good to resist. If you do stay I suggest you bring a cooler for beverages and your own ice because it's quite a trek to find the few avaliable ice machines in that hotel.
Here for a trade show in April 2014. We paid $28 a night and I don't smoke or gamble.. . Highlights:. Monorail access from hotel. Nice 3rd floor outdoor pool. Room was just fine. . Lowlights:. Smokey. Ubiquitous music playing. . Would stay here again if I had to. But would like some variety for next time.
If you area a true sports bettor, then the lvh is the place for you. They have every sport imaginable to bet. These guys will take any amount money on a game unlike other casinos that cap you at 1100 for a side and 500 for a total. This is definitely the place to be this final four.
I am a local so keep that in mind. . . I like the feel of this hotel. If You have traveled you know what I mean. . . The buffet is great even though I am not a big buffet person. Try the fried oysters. The talapia is awesome. . . The rooms are clean and large. Yes I stayed here even though I am local. Rates are great!!
I'm sure this was a happenin' place in the 70's.  The lobby and casino were nice but the casino becomes very smoky in the mid-afternoon to evenings so if you have breathing problems, this will be an issue for you.  I had to take a shower each time I got back to the room.  The rooms are large but dated.  Ask for a remodeled room, not sure why they all haven't been remodeled. ?  Baths are marble, floors and walls and doors are from the 70's.  The food was spotty.  Room service was prompt and the staff was great but the food was hit or miss.  Shrimp was great, the prime rib sandwich was pretty bad.  The girls @ the hotel store were snotty as were the hostesses @ the Paradise Cafe.  The bartender @ Vince Neil's place was great, the food was good, the prices great for happy hour but the drinks were weak.  Location wasn't great unless you had a convention next door but it is on the monorail line which is convenient and not too expensive.  Vegas used to be a good deal but not so much any more.  Food is very expensive, travel is expensive and the casino's are really tight.  I lost this time which I typically break even.  Not sure I'll come back and probably won't stay here again.  Bally's and Mirage are much nicer.
This hotel was awful, and is somewhere I would definitely not stay again, I don't care how good of a deal they are offering.  The floors in the room were spotted and stained.  Someone else's used soap was left for me in the shower, the television did not work (I attempted to have this corrected while I was at the hotel, but it was never fixed).  The in room safe would not work, and the monorail running outside all night kept me awake.  I did not feel like the room was clean or well maintained, and the area surrounding the hotel is quite run down.  I am from the Las Vegas area and go back to visit on occasion, and this hotel leaves a lot to be desired.  You would be better off looking for an off strip location than staying at this hotel.
2 1/2 stars.. . The good: I was here for a convention, so the hotel being so close to the action was a plus. The monorail station out back is tremendously convenient, and the room I had (1520) was spacious and had a great view of a nearby golf course, the Stratosphere, and Fremont Street off in the distance.. . The bad: It's so far removed from the hustle and bustle of the Strip. The monorail becomes your best friend if you stay here. The lack of electrical outlets in the room is an issue, there were what appeared to be cigarette burns in the rug by the closet, and the bath had a drip I couldn't quite stop. Also, I do gamble a bit, and whenever I walked by, the casino floor looked DEAD.. . We were only here for a night. It did the job, and there were some positives to note. That said, I probably wouldn't stay here again unless it was for another convention.
Worst hotel ever. When we got to our room it was not clean, garbage had not been dumped from previous people in there, called housekeeping - lady answered chewing her gum and could care less. Room appears old and not kept up. One bed was old and lumpy, TV only got 8 channels, windows dirty, room service not really room service - no menu - had to do by phone. Spent a lot of money for nothing but because of convenience to the convention next door. Will never stay there again.
Don't stay at the LVH in Las Vegas. I have stayed at the hotel for 8 years while attending a trade show and it has slowly gotten worse. . . When Hilton had the property it was a great place. Now the staff is aloof and rude. It is poorly maintained (had a runny faucet that was never fixed during an 8 day stay after daily complaints), errors in reservations, requests ignored, and you have to fight through the hookers at night to get to the elevators.. . On top of all this one is barraged all over the hotel by time-share sales pitches.. . Save yourself the pain and stay away from the LVH.
Got a great deal on a room for a cpl nights! Room was pretty nice, service not so much. There was no room service menu provided in the room and neither house keeping or the front desk had any nor knew where any were. Both departments kept sending me back to the other with no luck, and there was no 24hr place to eat. During my stay I never saw one. Hotel is peaceful with a bit of an older crowd. Nice sportsbook.
I love the fact that the monorail goes into the hotel, nice clean rooms. Awesome sportsbook.
Place was nice but what got me was damn resort fees and I wasn't aware of it until 2 days ago and they charged me for a bottle of water I did not use and you have to pay WiFi per day get out of here with that crap I wasn't even aware you can get connection on one device I didn't get to use that ask about it . The buffet I didn't try it . The pool was nice but jacuzzi was closed . Casino was kind of dead but I prefer it that way
The sports book and buffet here are great and gambling is cheap during the morning but I will never stay here again... first they charge you 20 dollar a day resort fee THEN if you want to use the weight room you have to pay ANOTHER 20 DOLLARS A DAY!!!! sorry but no other hotel has ever charged 2 resort fees for two different gym AT THE SAME HOTEL!!!! lvh love your sports book but ill never stay here again the rooms are ok but I can pay a cheaper resort fee and hotel rate else where and it will be better
Pros. 1) military discount and relatively affordable. 2) location is pretty good just off strip . . Cons. 1) little dirty. 2) ice machine was broken and they took 30 minutes to bring ice. 3) jets in bath did not work and when I called to ask them to be fixed they said they would send someone but never did . 4) charged Internet fee even if you do not use the Internet. . Basically get the good with the bad.  Long check in line (40 minutes) but gave us free drink tickets when I asked).  Paid extra for view of strip and was cool but windows had water stains.  Can work if you are on a budget.
Pros:. . Decent price for 6 days $118 (taxes and/or fees made it $172; a lil surprised by that but discount came from employer). Location is off strip and within walking distance to strip side. . CONS:. . Just cable with a few basic channels. It's more like they picked and chose channels. There's no HBO OR SHOWTIME. Motel 6, Howard Johnson, and Americas Best Value have HBO. WHY NOT LVH?. Hotel is NOT KID friendly. . You pay $18.xx daily in resort fees that should include FREE INTERNET OR WIFI and they charge you $50 for incidentals.. Soda machine on 8th floor had expired sodas from February 2014 (this is April 2014).. Room service had expired sodas from November 2013 (yes, 2013!). Verbally told housekeeping that services wasn't needed and they still entered in the room.. Paradise Cafe is OVERPRICED as many other restaurants in Las Vegas!. . Although this is my first time staying at this hotel, I expected a bit more because it used to be Hilton.
We paid a 'resort fee' however the jacuzzi was closed, the deceiving swimming pool was nasty dirty. Our bed sheets did not look clean and my daughter left with bug bites...we filled a complaint but the only thing we heard was ' pest control said nothing was detected'. Seems like they do whatever they want...what else can I do besides never staying at that hotel anymore. Buffet was good though.
There's not much to do at the Las Vegas Hotel that you can't do at other hotels of much better quality. If you're going to stay here, I recommend bringing some food or water of your own or you'll just end up spending an unnecessary amount of money buying them. My room seemed really old, especially the bathroom! My entire hall also smelled like weed... At least the lady behind the concierge desk was helpful in showing us things we could do. If you're going to stay at a hotel in Las Vegas, you might as well choose a better and more interesting hotel.
This hotel overall is great.  The internet had issues the whole weekend we were there, however, the room was awesome.  Perfect for my boyfriend and I.  The tub was huge, a lot of space and definitely upgraded.  We stayed in the east tower, which was extremely quiet (even though there was a bunch of people there for a cheerleading competition next door and a Pacquiao fight that weekend).  All in all, loved it.  Lots of self-parking and valet available.
This review is geared to frequent or business travelers.. . 5 stars because, as a players club member, they treat me FAR better than the rate they charge. As a road warrior who spends a lot of time in Vegas, the LVH is fantastic. By far the best Casino Hosts for someone who does not gamble a whole lot. I get treated like a King and that makes my Vegas grind so much better. . . Over the years I have stayed at pretty much every hotel on the strip. Unless you gamble heavily, most hotels have no love for you. The LVH is the exception but they are a little off the strip. Not an issue for me since I'm there for work , first and foremost. . . I highly recommend road warriors stay here and get yourself a player club card. Gamble a little on the slot machines or tables, to let them know you're alive, and then on your next trip, get a casino host assigned to you and milk them for upgrades. Often times, since vacancy is higher in the "off strip" hotels, I have been able to get awesome upgrades for standard rates. After calling on customers all day, who doesn't want to come home to a pimped out suite? . . Bottom line is that since the LVH came out of bankruptcy, they have proven loyal to the customers that are loyal to them. The old school Hilton feel is alive and well here, and unless that changes, they have earned my undying patronage. . . Gambling: My goal is to catch a good beer buzz off the free booze before I run out of chips. I also want to have a good time while losing my paycheck. The LVH has always done me right in this regard. Seriously,  the greatest dealers and pit bosses out there. I always have a good time.. . Food: Meh. Sports book deli is pretty much it for late night. The buffet is adequate. Vince Neals' place is ok. The steak house is good. The rest are predictable chain restaurants.  Not amazing but they don't suck either.. . Sports Book: If you like sports betting, this is a great choice. Best sports book in Vegas overall. . . Rooms: In over 50 nights stayed, I've never had an issue with cleanliness or maintenance issues.  And as someone who stays in hotels a lot, I do a thorough check for all manner of nasties and bugs.. . Rates: I get mailers all the time from the LVH. My rate is usually around $20 with the rare exception that a big event is in town and they have a high expected occupancy. Yes there are resort fees and Internet charges, but it's still $40 cheaper than the next closest hotel. In addition, I get at least a few nights free every month so a lot of my stays are free.
The location sucks, but using the monorail isn't so bad. And it's cheaper than taking taxis every where.. The hotel is cheap af, but you get hat you pay for. The rooms are whatever. I've stayed in a room where the bathroom is old and I stayed in a room with newly remodeled bathrooms. Definitely try and get the upgraded rooms.. Their valet takes forever so I suggest to self park.
If you want a Ballroom and Stage an Event like we did, our 20th Anniversary Celebration, Ken Ratigan and LVH Banquet Department is the BEST!  Superior in every aspect!.  I do 30 Seminars around North America every year so I'm very familiar with the business and I (& my wife) have NEVER found anyone better than Ken Ratigan!  He and his staff were attentive to all our needs, multiple options and making it all come together.  The remodeled hotel rooms and upgrades were excellent.
First let me say that I gave LVH 4 stars because I paid 38.00 a night including resort fees for my room. The room was big and clean. Everything worked.  Only complaint was the low water pressure in the shower and the extra charges for cable channels you should have got for free. We used the monorail to get down to the strip. Joined the players club and received free tickets to their Rock the Vault show which was fun. We arrived early at 10am and checked in within 5 minutes. Staff was very friendly.  Really liked the swimming pool. Restaurants were okay for the price.  My friend won 70.00 on the nickel slots. They give you a food or drink credit every morning of 16.00 if you go Green and don't have them clean your room. Just remember to call before 1am to let them know. That paid for our morning coffee and bagel!  Bottom line...  If you want to feel pampered don't stay here. Go to the Wynn or other hotels like that but be prepared to pay for it.  LVH is no frills. But a really good hotel for people like me who like a good bargain.
Do not stay here!!!! It is not even worth the twenty dollar a night rate. I booked this room on a whim due to a last minute decision to leave for Vegas early with a midnight arrival. I had reservations for the rest of the weekend at a four star resort so my stay at the LVH was just for one night. With six medical conferences this weekend many of the nice resorts were either sold out had nightly rates $300 above their norm. I should have taken the tips by many other fellow Yelpers to stay somewhere else. The LVH is run down, off the strip, and the clientele here is what you would expect for a $20/night hotel. HOOD RAT, HOOD RAT, HOOCHIE MAMA!  The beds are the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in. The shower drains slowly, and each time you flush the toilet you will be worried that it will get backed up. I was excited to see a Keurig coffee maker in the room but I was instantly disappointed because you would like to enjoy your in-room Keurig there is a $3.50 charge. I only give the LVH one star because of the lovely woman running the craps table. Her customer service far surpassed my expectations of this establishment. She was the only hi-light of my stay at the LVH. I am a Vegas veteran from Southern California and in all my visits I have never been so excited for the 11:00 a.m. check out time until now.  I will NEVER stay here again! At the LVH you definitely get what you pay for.
Let me start by saying that I am only staying here for a show we are exhibiting at the convention center.  Booking this hotel was strictly due to to it's strategic location next to the exhibit hall.  Although, after making the haul back and forth from LVH to convention center via the monorail (south hall still too far to walk), I would suggest staying at the Renaissance right next to the convention center.   I felt stupid the first time I got off the monorail and saw the Renaissance right smack next to it. It made the haul back to this crappy hotel sting that much more.. . Rooms:  I do agree with the other yelpers that the room was not updated, but at least mine was clean, thank God.  The TV reception stunk, the definition comparable to that of a box TV and no channels. Absolutely, no outlets!  It was like frontier town.  It is 2014, we have gadgets we need to power up, but LVH still only thinks we just need one for a hair dryer.  Between my iPad, iPhone, and laptop I had to juggle how much usage I used for each because there was not enough hours in the day to charge each one at a time.  Again, thank God my room was at least clean.. . Casino: Depressing. This word probably sums up this entire hotel.  Half the time I could not tell if the people at the slot machines had expired or just taking a cat nap between pressing "spin."  By the smell of things, my first guess would be expired.. . Food: This by far was the worst part of my stay.  First spot I ate was 888 noodles for lunch.  It was okay.  Took 20 minutes and asking three times to get my check. Just because it is Chinese cuisine do they really have to hire Chinese people that speak little to no English?  Second spot I ate was the Buffet. My three dogs would barf this back up.  Purine quality at best. You got free beer and wine with buffet purchase but I would rather spend 10 bucks for a drink then have to fight over the pig slop they are serving under hot lamps. And the clientele here was like a Springer reunion show.  It is 'all you can eat' folks, why all the pushing and shoving?  I felt like I was in the wild competing with the other predators for my meal.  I was throwing elbows left and right with the rest of them just for the hell of it after a while.  Third meal was the Paradise Cafe for breakfast.  I think they need to look up the definition of the word Paradise and then properly rename this place, Offensive Cafe.  The food and decor was just that, offensive.  I can't believe I even stayed after they sat me.  The last meal I tried there was Bistro Burger.  Waiter was bothered by having to wait on me and the burger was a step above Burger King, and I am not a fan of Burger King.  So now I get up and take the long haul on the monorail to the strip just for a meal that won't make me feel like something died in my stomach an hour after I ate it.  . . Overall:  Food sucked a big one, clientele was like vacationing with Cousin Eddy's family from the movies 'Vacation' and this place is so far from everything you spend most of your time walking/cabbing/or on that damn monorail. Laborious.. . DEPRESSING.
LVH was good to us. It's off the strip a little, which I appreciated because it's nice to be away from the hustle & bustle. My husband and I stayed here for a last minute birthday getaway for a weekend and I booked this hotel like less than 24 hours before our arrival. I was satisfied with the pricing and it totaled around $225 for two nights including the $40 resort fee (which is a dumb fee, but it's whatever). . . Check-in was smooth & totaled about 7 minutes. We got there after dark so the line was pretty empty. I was fooled & got excited because the service agent motioned my husband and I to come to this secret-looking back room for check-in. I thought we were gonna get an upgrade or something! Not so much, haha.. . The room was pretty simple. We had two queen beds, a flat screen TV, and it was pretty roomy. There was a table and two office style chairs. The room was very well-cleaned and well-lit and we were satisfied. The bathroom, on the other hand, was a little on the small side and it's pretty cramped where the mirror and countertop are. The mirror and countertop actually sit right outside of the bathroom and in front of the closet, if that makes sense. We got a non-smoking room but the hotel as a whole still smelled like smoke. But it's Vegas so we weren't too surprised by that.. . I can't review the casino, Superbook, or food because we weren't in the hotel much for any of those. We did eat at Vince Neil's Tatuado cantina several times though for the late-night Mexican food and $1 shooters, which were delicious and definitely a plus!. . Our main gripes were for the confusing parking and the elevators. Both are really out of the way and are difficult to get to. The second day was smoother but still difficult to navigate through. . . I'd stay at LVH again. It was worth what we paid for and was nice for us overall!
This place sucked. They put us in a room next to the elevator shaft so all night you hear the elevator go up and down. When you gamble no servers around for drinks. The rock concert was good. The sales people for the time share bombard you right when your trying to get to your elevator which is annoying. Won't be stating there again.
