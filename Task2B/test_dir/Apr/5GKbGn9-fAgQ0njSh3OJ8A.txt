Delicious but way too expensive
I can only speak to my restaurant experiences as I haven't yet taken part in the night club experience (and probably never will).  . . The food on each of my last two visits was terrific. My wife enjoyed the Kobe meatball with ricotta cheese and I usually lean towards the chicken parm, both of which were delicious. . . The service was a whole different story. It was so bad that it takes what should be a 5 star rating down to what should be less than a "2".  . . After checking in for our reservation, we opted to take a seat at the bar and have a drink before dinner (this was mistake #1). We alerted the hostess to this and she said no-problem. We were then greeted by the slowest bar tender on the planet, who struggled to tend to ourselves and 2 other customers she had at her bar (it was early in the evening and the place was nearly empty). After walking past us at least 3 times, she finally decided to stop. Seeing the disgust in my face, I immediately detected a bit of an attitude from the gal, when she asked if we needed a drink menu. A while later, another male employee hands us a drink menu. The bar isn't that big - how difficult is it to locate a drink menu? The bartender eventually returns to take our drink order, with my wife getting a glass of Pinot and I asked for a Coors Light. I was immediately told they don't have Coors Light (yet the Palazzo bar across the lobby does). In fact, you can get a Coors at darn near any bar in the Venetian or Palazzo....except at Lavo. I thought to myself, "this is the Lavo at the Palazzo and they can't walk a few feet for the overpriced beer I requested .... really? The cocktail waitresses throughout the casino can walk hundreds of yards for a customer's free beer and a lousy tip .... but god forbid the staff at Lavo walk a few feet for the customer actually paying for their beer.. . We return to the attractive (but not so bright) hostess who greeted us earlier, asking to be seated. She immediately grabs my wife's Pinot and pours it into a plastic cup, saying "you can't leave with the glass". I point out to her that we're not leaving, instead, asking to be seated at our table. She then catches on to her goof and seats us. . . On to dinner. Again food was terrific but service was marginal. I ordered a baked potato with my dinner, which arrived with my meal. I asked for 2 portions of butter as I wasn't interested in their spicy butter concoction. The waiter breaks open my potato in such grand fashion and said he'd return with my butter. Roughly 10-15 minutes later, our waiter returns and asks if we needed anything. I responded, stating "yes, the butter I asked for earlier". Realizing his mistake, he hurried off. A few minutes later, I see him at another table taking drink orders. Really, my potato is colder than my ice water and he's taking drink orders? Eventually, he returns with a rock hard piece of butter (looked like a bar of soap), which never melts on my potato. I didn't eat it as I wanted him and hopefully the Manager to see the state of the potato with un-melted butter. . . The bill arrives and the waiter indicates that the $11 potato was removed by his Manager, the same Manager who was too busy to walk about the restaurant and check on customers??? Low class joint. . . The food is very good but the staff and the service they provide was far from Venetian or Palazzo standards. They should hire fewer "pretty" people and more "skilled" service professionals. They tout the place as "fine dining" but I've gotten 10x better service from the Grand Lux Cafe and The Coffee Bean in the hotel.. . Never returning.
Super cool place and we were sat almost immediately and accommodated with a new table.   Our drink and appetizer orders were quick.  Our meal of simple stuff took almost 40 minutes.  Once it arrived it was good although the Kobe meatball was very salty and it and the cheese ravioli were Luke warm.
Had a ressie for 9:30...showed up...was given a beeper as if i had not made a ressie...excited for the food...not excited to tip
Great ambiance, decor, service and food. The Oreo dessert is to die for! Ryan was super helpful and made us feel like VIP. Definitely worth making it on your to do list for when visiting Vegas
Always a number nice experience when I go here,say hi to Roger in the bar upstairs he is a world class mixologist. . Try the 1 lbs meatball with the ricotta cheese it is the best , good for 2 people unless your hungry
A friend and I had dinner here and was treated great by Sal. . THE MUSIC SUCKS! SO NOT FOR THIS SETTING! COME ON GUYS! REALLY? So loud at points.. We both ordered things to share. . Meatball, tender , pretty good,. Lobster Ravioli, very good.. (Another pasta  dish) forgettable! Pasta was was undercooked, when we mention it - was told oh it's typical for it's a thick pasta; really? I disagree. They did offer to make another and or replace.. We ordered 2 side veggies, Asparagus and Rosemary potatoes =Nothing great about these, just what it is, but WAY small portions and WAY over priced!. Had some great cocktails. . Dessert =  20 layer cake , really good, rich  but good worth it.. Fried Oreo Z's. AMAZING! A must try. . I think over all I'd give these guys a  another try, just different items next time. . NOTE: If your going to charge that much,  make it worth it including the ambiance. Just was off with that crazy music you played.. Beautiful decor, just whole place didn't blend, off?
Most probably the worst Italian food I ever had .....the meatballs they talk so highly about were salty, the pasta was not fresh and tasted like it came out of a package! . The sangria was made with frozen fruit not fresh and worst of all I asked for no bacon in my pasta for kosher reasons and the waiter put my plate down and stated no bacon as to which it was covered in bacon and couldn't eat it! . My husband went to the manager to complain so he comped the pasta but the manager did not once come to the table to apologize ! Disgusting food and poor management and won't be returning !
Let me start by saying we had eaten in a few places in Las Vegas on this trip expecting to be blown away only to be disappointed.  Lavo was our last chance... And finally... What we expected!!!  We are on their patio which was a beautiful view of the strip. We started with a cocktail to unwind as we looked over the menu. We knew we were going to go heavy food wise so we choose a lighter app... The tuna tartar ( I wanted one of the giant meatballs but my girl said it would be too much, we did see them tho... She admitted it looked as if she made the right choice by the size). The tartar was amazing. Next we choose a moderate wine ($85) The Molly Dooker... Great blend. Our entrees were excellent as well. The real treat was the tiramisu... One of the best I have ever had. Our service was one of the best we had on our trip as two servers tag teamed their patio. I highly recommend for great Italian to give Lavo a try... You won't be disappointed
Worst Italian food I ever had,  both dishes me and my boyfriend had was super super salty,  it's so salty that hurts my tongue and I have to keep drinking water. The best food maybe was the complimentary garlic bread....
Went for a friend's bachelorette dinner and was not impressed at all.  Service was pretty much non-existent (the server didn't check on how our food was), the food came out almost cold, and the taste was just mediocre.  The ambience is ok for small tables as music is loud, making it difficult to converse with a large group.  But then again, I wouldn't waste your $ on this place.
