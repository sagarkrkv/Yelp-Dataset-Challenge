This is based on the food my boyfriend had, he ordered the sausage pot pie with gravy and eggs and took two bites of it and felt sick. A few hours later he was throwing up. I don't know if the food was not cooked right or something but the food really messed him up. And he is still in bed getting sick 2 days later.. . The only reason why we would ever come back is for the service our waitress was the sweetest, but other than that I would stay away from here . Plus the wait is super long for a table.
The portions are pretty dam big. Food is quite good. Fried chicken was juicy but didn't feel like you were eating grease. Waffles are really good too. And there's bacon in it. What's not to love about that.. . Make sure to order yourselves a BLT Mary, Bloody Mary with a twist. That was pretty dam good.
Everything was as I expected from reading reviews. Enormous portions. I wouldn't call it high quality food. Eggs were more brown than yellow which tells me they were probably cooked in bacon grease. Everything tasted delicious, just very unhealthy.
We have only eaten breakfast here and all portions were big enough for 3 days of breakfast. Last time in vegas had a bunch of comp left on my card so we ordered one of about every pancake on menu. Snickers bar pancake was awesome. Service was good. You have to go here at least once!
The wait was less than stated. The ambiance fun and the food adequate and abundant. Huge portions to share and fair prices plus fun staff. Yummy
I've been to Vegas many many times and I have always wanted to try this place. I finally came during my last trip to paradise. There was no wait which was unusual since I always see this place packed (maybe because we went at 5pm we avoided the dinner rush). My friends and I got seated right away. I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. I was starving so I was really hoping this would fill me up. . . When the dish came.... WOW... it was HUGE. It looked pretty messy, but it tasted amazing. Fried chicken was crispy and juicy, eggs and bacon can never go wrong together. And to make it extra heavy, mashed potatoes and biscuit. I finished everything and had the worst food coma I've had in a while. My friends also enjoyed the food and the large portions. The waitress was super friendly and really attentive. I would definitely come back if I don't go to them buffets.
Great food , great service. Anything on the menu is worth the price and worth ordering. Make reservations is all I've gotta say. There is always a wait
Their portions are massive so you will need a to go box.  Every dish has a unique twist to your traditional favorites.  Sage chicken Benedict and chicken and waffles are two amazing dishes and the server was great.  Great place to go
Pretty long wait to be seated, then for the food to come but well worth it! Everyone at my table had a beautiful presentation on their plate and everything tasted amazing. Would've had 5 stars if wait wasn't so long. Portions are huge , u get what u pay for also. Definitely would recommend anyone visiting Vegas to go here for brunch.
Amazing place if you are looking for a cheap breakfast that fills you up! Portions are nothing short of HUGE. Staff is very courteous. I will be going back on my trips to Las Vegas.
This rating is so low because of the overall service.  We arrived at the restaurant at 10:45 on a Saturday and were told we would have 1 hour wait for 5 people.  We decided to wait, and were seated just shy of an hour.  We ordered our food and drinks as soon as the waiter came over.  After we ordered, he informed us that since they make everything fresh it would take 30 minutes to get our food.  It was 11:50 and we thought that would give us time to make our next events at 1:20 for three of us and 1:45 for the other two.  At 12:30, 40 mins later, we asked for an update and were again told that the kitchen was busy but we should be coming up soon.  At 12:50 my sister and her family had to leave to get to their event.  So we told the waiter to cancel their order and asked to see the manager.  The manager finally came over with one plate at 1:05 and apologized for the late meals.  We explained that some of us had to leave without eating because of the delay and that we would have to hurry and eat our meal to make our event.  He again apologized and said that that the server should have told us they were behind earlier.  After all this he gave us 25% off our meals.. . The only saving grace (hence the 2 star and not 1) was the food.  It was good and there was plenty of it.  However, since we had to rush we really didn't get to enjoy the meal.. . The hostess should have told customers of the wait when they put their names on the list.  As we were leaving we heard another person complain that they also had to wait an hour and 20 mins. to get their food.. . 25% off is not enough to make up for
SUPER BIG PORTIONS.  never saw anything like it. First the wait.... super long like 45 minutes and on a monday..  Got seated and had a very nice waitress. Ordered meatloaf hash with egg and fruit. Good food. Weighted a few pounds. My GF ordered pancake meal and the size of the pancake was almost 12 inches across. . yum. Other than the line food is worth it. THis place was on Man vs Food. there is a wall outside that shows famous people who visited the place.
I don't really get the hype. The food was good and the portions are huge, but this was nothing amazing, particularly not worth the 90 minutes we had to wait for a table.. . My biggest bone to pick was the speed of everything. 90 minutes to get in, okay, I get it. I live in Portland. I'm used to long waits for brunch. But once we sat down, about 15 minutes to get our drinks, another 10 to order, then we waited.. . Almost an hour.. . Then our food came. I was hot, good, and big portioned, but nothing mind blowing. Then we waited, and waited. And 20 minutes later we had our check. We put our cards in the little black folder on the edge of the table. Then we waited. About 15 minutes to pay.. . All in, the experience was about two hours too long. If they paid attention to diners, the line would be shorter and I would have headed out happier.
This Hash House a Go Go is just ok. I have been to one other in the M resort and hotel and had a better experience there. This location is an older looking one. The smell of smoke from the downstairs area also creeps up. I ordered a pancake/eggs/sausage meal. The pancake was very, very large. The sausage and eggs were bland and below average. The price is seems to be a bit much just for a giant pancake and subpar eggs and sausage.
Good food. Large portions. Two adults could not share one plate but we did not finish the egg plate and the very large pancake.
Because I'm such a fan of Tractor Room and Great Maple, I can admit that my expectations of HHAGG were VERY VERY HIGH. Although I think the San Diego location is better, the Vegas location did deliver.. . The wait was a little under an hour to get seated, but the time between ordering and receiving your food was insane. We literally waited an hour to eat after ordering. Granted it was Saturday morning, but arriving at 10 we were certain we were going to beat the brunch rush. Apparently everyone else had the same idea.. . The other bummer for me was that EXACT DAY they debuted the new menu which no longer features the breakfast pot pie. To say my heart was shattered would be an understatement. . . Although devastated, I pulled myself together and ordered the bacon, avocado scramble with egg whites and light cheese. The meal was delicious but not anything spectacular that seemed like a HH signature.
I absolutely love, love, love this place. They are open 24 hours, which is very convenient, especially in Sin City. Their portions are HUGE, and the prices are very reasonable for the food quality you receive. I suggest you go whenever they are not busy to avoid long waits. HHGG's foodis available for room service during certain hours at The Quad Hotel. Definitely a plus whenever I'm staying there. Some of my favorite dishes are the BBBLT, HH Stuffed Meatloaf, Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, and the HH Quesadilla. Hash House is a MUST whenever I'm in Vegas.
The food is quite delicious, and the portions are huge. The drinks are colorful and delicious. I would highly recommend.. . Only 4 stars though because of the hostess service. I came with a party of 8 and (not surprisingly) we had to wait. The hostess then gave our table to someone else and straight up lied to my face when I approached her about it. When she finally did sit us, she tried to separate my group into two separate tables. Our waitress was great though, and totally made up for it. She let us put the two tables together. When my food came out significantly later than the rest of my party's food... she comped me a drink.
Big portions (if you're sitting for 2 best to share), the only thing I couldn't get over was you couldn't get a side of hash browns. The place is named hash house.. Service was friendly, there was a half hour wait at about 11am to keep in mind. Had the chicken and waffles, everything cooked to perfection, chicken was juicy a bit more spice would have taken it over.
Delicious breakfast, original menu, fun ambiance. The  downside  was our long waitfor a table (we were forewarned, therefore understandable), but  then on top of that the 60 minute wait from sit down to receiving food. The latter was totally unacceptable, especially at breakfast.
First time here. Sooooooo good! I had the famous chicken and waffles. The chicken was so crispy and flavored well. The sage really stood out and I luved it. While I was working my way through the waffles I discovered bacon inside them. How great is that! The portion was so big I was able to take the leftovers home and eat them for dinner and breakfast the next day. I also had the old school hot chocolate. Delicious! A must stop.
Service was terrible. The food was ok. I ordered corn beef. Found it odd to have a biscuit with my meal. I get the "western" or "country" deal but to me it didn't go with it. Wish the orange juice was freshly squeezed too.
First things first... portions are HUGE.  No really.. huge-er than huge.   Find a friend at your table and share or pick something you might want to eat again for the next two days. . . Yummy comfort food, casual setting and decent service gives this place high marks for me.  Our party of 8 was hungry and more than ready for dinner... we were seated pretty quickly and our waitress was quick to greet us.  They offered a good HH deal on wine and the menu offers so many choices - healthy eaters and indulgers will both enjoy.  On our way to the table we spotted the entrees and that quickly made our decision to share meals!  Table favorites were sage fried chicken & waffles (PS two hungry boys shared this and were completely satisfied and full!), the burgers and the kokokmo sandwich. I especially like the fries - hot, salty and crispy. Not sure I would rush back next time I am in Vegas but definitely a good spot to grab dinner (or brunch I hear), especially if you are looking to soak up some of the Vegas alcohol.  They were great with our large party and with no reservation - bonus!
Guess the food is better when you eat in?. . Stayed at the Rio with my family and my dog so someone had to stay behind with the pup while everyone else procured breakfast. This seems to be the only real breakfast place in the hotel/casino so options were pretty limited.... kind of like the menu.. .  If you want fried chicken, bacon waffles, bloody Marys garnished with a deconstructed sandwich, etc, then 4  stars are probably well deserved.. . My parents ordered the basic breakfast (one with scrambled eggs the other with over easy, both with sausages) and I ordered the sun dried tomato, goat cheese, & basil scramble with an extra side of chicken sausage.. . In all honesty, I was starving so didn't realize a the stuff I missed until we got our to go order to the room.  First of all, all our orders were supposed to come with biscuits and fruit and we received a total of 1 biscuit and no fruit.  Second of all, I didn't even mind that there weren't enough biscuits because the giant hockey puck they tried to pass off as a biscuit was a dense mass that tasted like it was made yesterday.. . We all chose fried potatoes which looked sad and possibly prepared at the same time the biscuit was made.  I didn't eat mine but my dog seemed to like it.. . Also I'm pretty sure (receipt confirmed it) that my chicken sausage (which they do admit is in a pork casing) was actually pork sausage and was a little over seasoned for my tastes.. . Lastly, the eggs. Had such high hopes for these. The scrambled eggs were either not seasoned and or not eggs? They were dense and oddly textured saved only a little by the sundried tomatoes, scant amount of fresh basil, and few crumbles of goat cheese.  Full disclosure, my dog wouldn't eat the eggs unless it had been touching sausage or had some cheese attached. . Overall our breakfast was disappointing. Other than the forgotten items though the service was fantastic (hence the 2 stars rather than 1). All the staff members were so friendly and nice! The place was well decorated and very clean.. . If they can get the kitchen sorted out I may consider eating here again but this place is definitely out of rotation on any future Vegas trips - even if we stay at the Rio again.
We were so excited to try this Iconic Indiana Eatery.  Located at the back of the Quad Resort  Casino a escalator plops you right in front of the eatery.. . We tried the signature Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, a HH ginormous blue berry pancake and a pistachio ice mocha.  Okay first off, the portions are huge!  One pancake is probably enough for at least three people.  My benedict was gigantic as well but consisting of: mashed potatoes, biscuits, tomatoes, mozzarella, scrambled eggs, fried chicken and a pink country gravy the flavor combination was a little too muddled for my liking.  I can easily see the Sage Chicken and Waffle stack as being much better.  The pancake itself was tasty but it was so huge it was on the dry side also they need to serve this thing with a pitcher of syrup and lots of butter instead ofthe single scoop and tiny cup it came with.. . My pistachio ice mocha was very good and even better after I stirred up the whipped cream to add some additional sweetness to the drink.  I could definately taste pistachio!. . Over all I think we need to come back here and try the chicken waffle stack and maybe a stuffed burger to give a fair review, but for now I rate this as 3 stars.
The one redeeming jewel in our disastrous stay at the Quad was the Hash House A Go Go located in The Quad lobby. . . The corizo hash was excellent and the fruit plate was outstanding. We saw other dishes being delivered to tables that we asked what were because it all looked GREAT! Its comfort food so get ready to eat!. . I will be back although I wont be staying at The Quad ever again!!!!
HOW I GOT STARTED WRITING YELP REVIEWS. . In the spring of 2012 I went to my cousin's bachelor party in San Diego. Prior to that I had only written one Yelp review. Since the San Diego trip was going to be pretty expensive, due to the itinerary, I decided to write Yelp reviews of the places that I visited. At that time I didn't think I would constantly write Yelp reviews during these last two years? One of the places I ate in San Diego was Hash House A Go Go. I ordered a salmon omelet. The one regret I made was that I didn't order the sage fried chicken and waffles after seeing some of the customers eating this dish.. . Yesterday morning I ate here. Despite the item that was featured on Man vs. Food, I knew what I wanted - the sage chicken fried and waffles. As I remembered in San Diego the portions were huge. To my surprise there were small slices of bacon inside the waffles. As the saying goes everything is better with bacon. I couldn't give this rating a perfect 5-star because of the fried chicken. Despite its crunchy skin the breast meat was slightly dry. Overall I liked the dish because you get what you pay for due to the huge portions. Unlike the last time I went to San Diego location I had no regrets.
I had the chicken and waffles and they were FANTASTIC! My friends said the scrambles they got were average so maybe avoid those. The wait was excruciating though; make sure you have lots of time to wait and then lots of time afterward to recover, the portions are huge. Overall, I would definitely recommend and I am definitely returning on my next trip.
This place is worth the long wait. Delicious every time and the food is presented beautifully. The breakfast potatoes are fried well done, the eggs when ordered basted are perfect, and the menu has interesting items even for vegetarians. Sitting at the bar is entertaining because you can watch them make drinks like the s'more mocha, which I will definitely save room for next time.
Great service. Cool atmosphere. Trying the Sage chicken as featured on Man vs. food. Highly recommended by the staff.
Nope. Don't go. Overrated overpriced. Super long waits and the biscuits are terrible.
What a dining experience!!!!. . We have lived in Vegas 4 months now and this has to be the BEST breakfast place we have tried yet.  I can't wait for family to come visit to take them all here!. . We went on a Saturday morning early so we expected a wait.  It was crowded but the wait was only about 20 minutes.  The menu was expansive and included a blend of traditional b-fast and lunch items.  The drink menu is so large it has its own menu! . . We tried the chicken and waffles plate, and a special called "the Boston hash".  The plates are massive....big enough to easily feed 3 people!  Everything was excellent including the service.  If you like strong coffee....this is your spot!. . I have to say....if you are looking for a b-fast joint....you GOTTA try this place!
Be pre paired to wait up to 30 minutes no matter what time you decide to go here.  The food is worth the wait.
Came here after a late night at the strip looking for something to ease the hangover. After waiting for our table for an hour we. Were finally seated, not really a foul though because we came in at about 1, right during lunch/brunch rush on a Saturday.. Highlights:. -They have fresh squeezed orange juice. -Awesome bloody marries. -Portions are literally ginormous- most of them could feed three people. . - food was good, heavy and just what a hangover needs. . . Overall good Vegas atmosphere and good hangover food. Type of place you need to be rolled out of after you're done eating!
Maybe I wouldn't have had such high expectations if I hadn't been to the Hash House in San Diego (which is fucking amazing by the way), but I was definitely disappointed with this location. Our server informed us there was some sort of catastrophe in the kitchen and our food was going to take awhile, which was fine. It wasn't the servers fault our food took an hour to hit the table. However, while we were waiting, the server never came back to update us on the food, refill our drinks, nothing. Over an half passed. I could see our server joking around and talking to the other workers behind the bar. Finally our lukewarm food comes and still no one checks on us. No one ever refilled our drinks. I've had the same drinks in SD and the presentation was much better. My gfs champagne supernova in SD had a sugar rim and garnishes. This one literally looked like dirty dish water, had no garnish, and our server told us to "make sure to give it a good stir" because the bartender sure as hell didn't. Then I had to hunt down someone else to get my check because no one ever came to our table. Not going back.
The place has a TON of seating and is open 24 hours which is nice. The quad also offers free self parking, which isn't too far away.. . Isn't the nicest place in vegas, but it's a decent home style diner type place. . . Huuuuge portions, very hearty food. Expect to leave feeling a little groggy. Prices are reasonable. Open 24 hours which is nice. . . Chicken and waffles are good: it's not as deep fried as most fried chicken, but is lightly breaded, flavored with sage, and crumbles off when you cut it. Yum. The mashed potatoes with cheese and bacon mixed into it is food too.
Fairly priced and decent home-cooked type of food. Kind of a quirky lil hidden restaurant with interesting plating and friendly staff. They put so much food on the plate it's ridic. I didn't have to wait for service but we prob ate at a weird hour like 10 or something.
ZERO STARS. Good food, enormous portions however the service is POOR. Too many amazing places to eat in Vegas to have to deal with the crappy service and inappropriate people working here.
Had to try out the famous man vs food. Hash House A Go Go when we were in Vegas and man was I not disappointed!. . Went on a Monday morning. Place was very busy and was told roughly a 20 minute line. We waited about ten minutes and were seated in a nice little booth. . .  Our waiter was great and suggested the spicy blood Mary's so started out the morning with a couple of those which were good size for a Vegas drink. When our food arrived at our table I knew we made the right choice. From seeing the show I knew the portions were huge so my gf and I decided to split one of their snickers pancakes and the bacon, cheese, avocado scrambler. The food was amazing! The snickers pancake was probably the best pancake I have ever had! The pieces of snickers was a perfect combo to a delicious buttermilk pancake. My girlfriend who loves savory food really enjoyed the scrambler with the fresh avocado and breakfast potatoes. Even splitting this meal we were not able to finish all of our food.. . Overall it was a great dining experience would definitely recommend and I would for sure go back!
the portions are enormous! i had the tractor driver combo with french toast and was so full i didn't need to eat the rest of the day. my husband had the corned beef hash and he loved it, and it left him stuffed to the brim as well! the bloody marys are perfect - just the right amount of spice! i've been to vegas twice but this was the first time we ventured into the quad/linq area and it is not to be missed!
Went there on Easter Sunday and even tho it was not packed they took about and hour and a half to bring our food . We asked what was taking so long and they said they were running slow . They were very polite that's a plus the food was very yummy and big but I gave it three starts because they took forever to make waffles and eggs :/
Tried the Pork Tenderloin thinking its might be a healthier alternative with spinach, tomato. Not a chance pork tenderloin was breaded and laying on a huge mound of potatoes. Huge portions! $27.00 should be a meal for two. Sorry that i missed Sushi happy hour at Flamingo as is my stomach.
One of my fav places to go eat when in Vegas. Chicken and bacon waffles and watermelon kiwi lemonade is a must when here. U cant go wrong.
Meh...was crowded.  Food may have been fresh at some time, but did not come through that way.  Parts of my eggs were a bit tough.  Had to use a knife to cut my waffle (yes really). . . The staff was friendly and it was a lively environment.  . . Wouldn't go out of my way to go back.
This was one of my favorite places to eat and drink on the strip. We first stopped by for breakfast, the wait was 25 minutes which is a bit long but understandable for a popular restaurant. We put our name in and went down to the casino to gamble a bit. We came back and we're sat within minutes. Our server Alonzo was helpful with directing us through the menu because I was very indecisive. I wish he warned us about portion size, had we know how big the plates were, we would have split an order. We went from starving to uncomfortable full with less than half the plate eaten.. We also came back at 2 am because the place is 24hours. We ordered this particular bartenders signature margaritas and were not disappointed. The drink was made well and made this light-weight pretty drunk.
We were looking for a good breakfast place on our last day so we checked yelp and decided to try this place. We were seated pretty quickly even though this place was packed. Our server was super friendly and although he did mention how big the portion sizes were, my boyfriend and I wanted different things so we got our own plates. We should have listened to our server..we didn't even get through half our plates before we were stuffed! I got the chorizo hash and my boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy. Both plates were yummy and very filling. I highly suggest sharing with someone or you will find yourself talking half of it to go. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!
A lil on the pricey side, but what isn't in Vegas!! But honestly for the price u are getting quality food in large portions. Sage fried chicken with spinach is amazing, my gf had the mushroom hash with scrambled eggs.  Check it out!!
Prepare to wait a life time. It was a two hour wait. 1 hour to be seated and 1 hour to get our food. Bc of how packed it was we were expecting some kind of over the top Breakfast. But reality hit quick, breakfast was ordinary nothing you can't find anywhere else. If you order eggs make surethey are COOKED. 3 of us had water down eggs, looked like powdered eggs. Not "fresh" at all, like the waitress explained. Anyway.. To not worth the wait.
This place was horrible. Bad service, long waits for food & service, bland food. Barely saw the staff...... . Yes, the food is HUGE portions but everything is practically tasteless & bland! The biscuits that everything come with are horrible & taste more like flour than anything else. Very, very dry.. . I got the smoked salmon/potato hash & it was OK. The potatos were burnt & greasy. I ended up just picking out the salmon. The boyfriend got the sage chicken & said it was incredibly dry.. . Won't return unless it's 2am... not worth the wait from 10am-2pm.
Really fun spot to try out!! My husband and I were excited to see what all the excitement was about and looking for a big breakfast. It was very busy inside but the 24 min wait was not bad. All staff was amazing! Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. My pancake was great but a little disappointed it didn't come with any sides. My husbands biscuits and gravy were pretty bland and a let down. It was good overall but just not quite as amazing as we thought. The delicious drinks and excellent staff made it worth it
Came here on a Sunday around 11:30am with my mom. They quoted us about 45 minutes to an hour for a table but we got in in about 30 minutes. While you're waiting you can always go downstairs and check out the [smaller sized] casino. We split the chicken and waffles and it was huge. I ate 1 waffle and half of one chicken breast and was done. The couple next to use had the pork/ham benedict and it was ginormous. The chicken could have been seasoned a little bit differently but it was still good.
Came here on a Sunday around 11:30am with my bf and they told us the wait will be approximately 45 min.  Fine, since we were just gonna drive home to SD from there anyway.  We got seated at around the 40 min mark.  Our waitress was nice, but very forgetful (in terms of food and what we wanted to drink.)  By the time the food came, we were famished.  No need to say, didn't get around to taking pictures of the food.. . The food was superb and they give u ALOT. You def can split one meal in two. Worth a try, delicious, but be forewarned that you will be "sick" to your stomach after. =]
