$24.99 per person for an all-you-can-eat buffet with endless choices of any type of food you could want and a great selection of desserts AND unlimited beer AND wine!?? Winner winner buffet dinner. . . We went on a weekday and there was absolutely no wait. We simply walked up to the cashier, paid our way in, had the nice young lady allow us access into the buffet and we found our table. The wait staff was courteous and attentive. They have all different cuisines: Italian, Mexican, Asian, American, lots of different meat options, pastas, salads, breads and rolls, and other foods I've never even heard of. . . Then you walk over to the dessert section and they probably had about 30 different types of desserts and an assortment of 15 different flavors of gelato. . . Positives: cheap price on weekdays for an unlimited supply of good food, tasty desserts and beer and wine. Attentive wait staff. Quick seating.No lines.
I would like to start  by saying the visit started with a two hour wait and the cattle fence was not even half full when we arrived! Without a doubt the worst line of any in Las Vegas. Now to the food, overpriced, cold, empty dishes in the food lines and once again customer service was terrible. This could be a nice place if the management cared about the customers paying the bills. The only plus to this mediocre eatery has alcohol that was added to give the illusion that customers were enjoying themselves. Being a non-drinker this buffet has nothing to offer out of the ordinary.
Went on a Sunday afternoon for Lunch and it was like $50 bucks. They had (dry) crab legs, peeled shrimp, and their open soft bar (draft beer and wine), but $50 bucks for any buffet = no thx.. . Writing this review more for my own reference to not come back here for the Seafood buffet than anything else...
Woops wrote in the wrong Studio B one. Why are there two yelps for the same place?!. . I'm just gonna copy and paste what I wrote.. . $25 dinner buffet at Las Vegas?? Whaaaaa? Food must suck right? Wrong.. . Everything I tried that day was delicious and flavorful! Surprisingly, they didn't have one item of food I didn't like. Although they may not have as much selection as other buffets, its definitely worth the price.. . Especially that dessert bar. Omg.And I don't even like sweets. That's saying something. . . The only downside is it's about 20 minutes from the strip. But hey, it's worth driving that far instead of paying $$$$ for crappy food right?
Best buffet in Las Vegas, hands down. Great options, so much food and different cultures to chose from. LOVED it and can't wait to go back again (SOON, Hopefully!)
came here at 2 pm on a friday so we could get the lunch price of $15.99 and eat dinner food which started at 2:30 pm. i guess a 100 other people had that idea too. i was glad they honored lunch price for everyone in line before 2:30. finally sat down at 4 pm. line moved slow but the buffet looked empty. that was annoying. . . - seafood was nothing special. - prime rib was really good. - sushi looked old and there was no sashimi. - sadly my favorite thing was the asian bbq ribs. - free beer and wine. - desserts bar was huge. . overall, for $15.99 this buffet was worth the money. but if i had to pay the $40 reg price, i'd be sadly disappointed.
What the HECK!!!. we heard so many things...4 stars on yelp, one of the top 3 vegas buffets behind wicked spoon and bacchanal, blah, blah, blah.. we were sooo excited...out first ladies weekend away from the kids and hubbies and we had to hit at least one vegas buffet to say we truly did vegas.  the other 2 buffets were hovering close to $50 fordinner so we decided on studio B since it was $39.99 for a seafood friday dinner buffet.  . we jumped in our mini van and left the strip to head to henderson and at 6:00 we had to wait in a 45 minute line.  our fault completely for not peeking our head into the food but we drove all the way there in our minivan and we just had to believe yelp so we figured it was worth the wait.. all i had to do was make one quick trip around the buffet and i knew it was a DUD!!!  i love to eat and so unfortunately had my share of buffets...let's just say buffets are not my fave...pure gluttony.  but i figured if we are going to do it...let's do it right!!!. i think this place is nothing more than a tiny weeny step above home town buffet (i think that's what it's called...right?)  sure there is a huge selection but i would definitely choose quality versus quantity.  wilted salads, frozen fried fish, boxed mash potatoes, dried up small tiny crab legs, cheeeaaaaap wine from a box, even their lattes which i was sooo excited about was the type you pushed a button for and sooo darn sweet!!!. ARRGGGHHHH!!!. so disappointed...not only by the food but also the HYPE!!!. still had a blast in vegas BABY!!!
Do not come here!!! We waited 45 mins to get a seat. No one is clearing tables. The food is marginal at bedt. I got a beef short rib. The meat is so tough and grisly that my knife cannot cut through. . STAY WAY FROM HERE.. . Ok the buffet had some decent food. But the wait for a clean table made this a no return.
Like all Vegas buffets, this one has it's highs and lows, so for the sake of brevity I'll get to the point.. . Highs:. - Prime rib. This was easily the best buffet prime rib I've ever had, so much so I indulged in a second piece. Extremely tender and very flavorful. Au jus was good too.. - Warsteiner on tap. Can't go wrong there. . - Grilled asparagus was definite highlight amongst a collection generally sad looking vegetables. . - Cappuccino was very good.. - If you leave without trying the creme brule you have missed out on the best thing there. . . Lows: . - Seafood. All of the seafood was sub-par. The crab legs were so skinny they looked like they were harvested from a snow crab labor camp. Oysters were horrible and probably poisonous. Shrimp were rubbery and about the size of plankton. The mussels smelled so bad that my survival instinct kept me from trying them. . - Sushi. Jesus, where to begin. Let's just say I think I found out where all the expired sushi at Albertsons ends up.. - Lobster bisque. I know what lobster bisque tastes like. This isn't it. Somehow I imagine giant, white, one gallon cans of ACME Lobster Bisque stacked in back.. . All-in-all we managed to have a good meal and, more importantly, a good time. Trying to guess the cholesterol levels of the, shall we say, more calorically challenged patrons kept us entertained. For the price (87$ for 2) this turkey didn't fly for us and I don't see us coming back anytime in the next millennium.
Having read the reviews lamenting the line time and decrease in food quality, I reluctantly agreed to make the drive down to the M this weekend.  We went at an off peak time (2-3pm) on a Saturday but there was no line!  Winning!  It was pricey at $86 for two of us after tax.  The crab legs are a popular draw, they are now split for your eating like a machine convenience.  I am starting to agree that, despite the decrease in work, the split legs are perhaps less appealing than the ones you do on your own.  Split legs tended to be colder and more difficult to get a good chunk of meat.  Still good!  . . There are a myriad of dining options at this buffet.  The Kalbi Korean ribs were tasty.  The lamb chops were thin and covered in a delicious sauce.   I also enjoyed the all you can drink options.  Mimosas, white zin, beer, strawberry cider, merlot, cab. to name a few.  Our waitress told us she has seen a number of people booted from the buffet due to fights, vomiting, passing out...I guess you get what you ask for when you let people drink infinitely!
Very nice food selection and quality.  I'd give the food 4 stars, but they are a bit understaffed, because we spent 15 minutes at the front of the seating line after we paid and then our "waiter" took a while for the drinks.. . And on that subject, why does a waiter have to bring you a glass of water or bottle of ketchup, even though you can go load up a couple of plates with $20+ of food on your own?
As locals, My husband and I have been to almost every buffet on the Strip, and this is one of the better ones. This is the one we go to on holidays. We don't see any bad behavior from the patrons, as one of the other reviewers wrote. Though I find it is one of the best places for people watching. . . Pros: . . - Wide variety of different types of food (Asian, Indian, Traditional American, Italian). - Quality is very good. - clean and they keep food hot and trays full. - good service. . Cons: . . - Quality of food has gone down somewhat . - Location of M Resort is far from everything
I have eaten here several times already. This is the only buffet I know of in Vegas that  serve you beer and wine for free. It's already included in the price.. . For those who haven't been to this buffet yet, I have recorded a Full Steady 10 minute Tour of Studio B Buffet. . . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNA8PokNSDE. . The food here is really good. Everything is presented nicely on the buffet stations. . . I love their dessert stations. Lots of varieties to choose from. . . Our server was very helpful. She kept asking if we wanted more refill. Once were done with the plate, she cleared it right away.. . The only downside to eating at this buffet is that it's very far from the strip at about 10 miles to Mandalay Bay. The only time, I will stop here to eat is on my way to Vegas from Los Angeles or if I'm planning on leaving Vegas.. . So like I said before, if you guys want to see what they serve at M Resort Buffet: Check out my video below:. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNA8PokNSDE
Had Studio B Buffett again and it was good. Friday nights are usually ten times better but the quality on any day is good still. I feel like for the regular days, it's a bit overpriced and the wait time was too long. I understand waiting like that and having seafood and more but not on a regular day.
Absolutely the best buffet I've ever been too.. So much variety. First time I went there is like almost 4 dozen shrimps. The M cider was pretty amazing. The best part was the desserts. They so many different desserts waiting to be eaten by me. Love the different types of ice cream as well.
Food was ok, but the cashier intentionally makes people wait in the line for a long time. For us, it was one hour waiting in a short line, not worth it. Do not recommend.
Food is mediocre and not worth the price they charge.  Most of the meat is cold, tough and overcooked and quality of the meat is also sub par - lamb chops are shoulder cut and tough, ribs are also cold and tough.  The desserts look far better than they taste.  Some of the salads are OK.  Place is clean though.
Went to Studio B for Seafood Dinner Buffet a month ago (Friday, March 28, 2014) based on the 4-star rating here on Yelp.... which we thought must justify the lengthy drive away from the strip and the $40/person cost.. . Our party of 4 waited about an hour even though we were quoted a 20 minute wait.  The lines moved very slowly, yet when we finally got in... there were tons of open tables. Not sure what that was all about.  The buffet food was totally unimpressive... it seemed like all low-end selections..... I only enjoyed the snow crab legs.. The table service would only serve the standard soft drinks, juice, coffee and tea. If you wanted the wine or cappuccinos that are included with the meal, you have to go get in line yourself for those drinks.  After getting our soft drinks, our server seemed to disappear.  . . Don't drive far, pay lots of money for this sub par food and service!
The food wasn't as great as I thought it would be, and wasn't worth standing in line for more than an hour and a half.  The steak was tough, the Kal-bi was cold, and all they had was snow crab legs.  We paid over $100, including tip, we expected better.  We could have paid less at the Rio and gotten more seafood, including lobster.  . . The wine and beer station was great!  I hit that station a few times after our very long wait in line!  SMH. . THE LINE-  This is why they get the lone star rating.  General buffet line treatment was horrible!  There were no benches lining the wall, and there was space for it!  The VIP line moved quickly, and they had seats in their waiting area (the thought of "we are the peasants waiting for the remainder of the VIP's food" ran through my head).  An older woman almost fainted from standing so long.  I'm not that old, but I was wearing 1 inch heals and by the time we were at the front, my shoes were off.  Usually, after you pay the cashier, you get seated a few minutes later.  We ended up waiting an additional 40 minutes after payment and we were only a party of 3.  When we got in the dining area, we noticed the back area wasn't full and a lot of the tables needed to be bussed.. . Based on our awful waiting experience, and the fact that they have no handicapped line ( it's a good thing my Autistic son wasn't with us), we give it a piss poor rating.  SHAME ON YOU STUDIO B!!!  PUT SOME BENCHES ALONG YOUR WALL!!!
One of the best buffet I have ever been to in my life. Those that give this place a two star or one star really need to explain what other buffet they've been to in their past that better.  Ya the line is long but just like others say: the wait was worth it.  I've been here three times now and it's never a let down
