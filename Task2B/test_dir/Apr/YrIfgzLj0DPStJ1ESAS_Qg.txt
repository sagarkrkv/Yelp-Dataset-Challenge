I love this place from the very start. When my came here from the Philippines I brought her here to impress her with good food since I am not a good cook and I didn't failed it becomes her favorite restaurant.
The food was great, our server endearing!  Why the hostess decided to tell management we were "livid" is beyond me.  We were blindsided when our server came to apologize, then angry when management REFUSED to come speak to us to assure our server was great!  Without letting us know our server was clocking out, while we were literally discussing ordering more food, a NEW server came to us with our check!  I guess you have to leave when your servers' shift ends?!  I tried to call and complain to a manager on duty a few days later, I asked if there was some place quiet they could step to in order to keep me from having to shout over the background noise...apparently, that's "just the way it is" according to Jessie, the manager I got.  Three words in, she was already asking me to repeat myself.  Screw it.  You didn't want to speak to me while I was there and you are incapable of hearing over the roar when I call on the phone.  TOTAL lack of professionalism!  The food was GREAT.  The server I was supposedly "livid" with was AWESOME...There are multiple locations...steer clear of this one!
As an Orange County native, I hate to admit it but this Hot N Juicy blows Boiling Crab out of the water!! . . My man and I ordered a pound and a half of shrimp(hot n juicy;medium) . The shrimp were huge!! They were so full of flavor and the juices just give it that extra kick!! . . My husband ordered a pound of clams and he's not impressed. That's one thing he likes a bit more about boiling crab! But the shrimp there were not as pleasing! . Seems likethe clams were half pound of juice and half pound of clams! . . . We will definitely be back here again!! . . . . . Minus
I gave it three stars because the flavor was good!! Crawfish was not fresh I can tell it was frozen and some of the meat was mushy!
One pound of shrimp, 3 beers and a dozen sausages was a perfect meal! Great friends, great food equaled a great time. Worth the wait and I will be back! Lobster, muscles, king crab were the pinnacle to the meal! . Laura was a great server!
I love hot n juicy, I prefer it better than other crawlfish places! As soon as I walk in, I smell the amazing seafood served here and it leaves my mouth watering. I don't think the corn is fresh, and most of the time I come here the crawl fishes are frozen. . I always order the one pound shrimp and it leaves me soooo full. Their rice goes great with the shrimp sauce! I love this place.
Okay. So this is quite possibly one of the best places to eat in Vegas.. . The food is about as filling as crawfish can be expected to be - but who cares? No one goes there for the filling. They go for the KICKASS flavor!. . There are 5 or so levels offlavoring, ranging from basic to complex. There are about as many levels of heat. . . I've eaten here many times and have NEVER been disappointed!
Love this place! People have different taste buds but in my opinion and my husbands, this place is better than boiling crab. Reason being:. . Less wait time now that there are 2 locations near each other. yay!. . Service: funner happier servers compared to boiling crab.. . Cost: a little costly but its seafood, its fresh and so far nowhere else like it. No, not boiling crab either.. . Taste: More flavorful spices yet less greasy and heavy compared to boiling crab. That is good enough and convincing to me. I mean come on people, its not featured on Man vs Food on the Food Network for nothing you know.
Good boil
Where do I begin? I am a little lost for words for this place. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of Boiling Crab, so I was looking forward to an improved experience at Hot N Juicy Crawfish. Boy, was I wrong! Since I'm not a fan of peeling shrimps and breaking off the head, I decided to order calamari. I love calamari, so I was looking forward to them; specially after a four hour drive. Unfortunately, my taste buds went through an awful experience. The calamari looked pale, texture was soggy, and undercook! How in the world can you mess up something that goes in the fryer?! Second, the batter hadno seasoning and it tasted plain. I was so disappointed, because I really wanted to like this place. However, our waitress was very accommodating and apologized; although, it wasn't her fault. The waitress offered to comp my food and asked if I wanted to order something different. I was very pleased with her customer service, but said no after getting something raw. I was afraid of food poisoning; specially, since I'm in Vegas. . . Great customer service earned this place two stars and their fried shrimp. The fried shrimp tasted fresh and it was fried all the way. In my opinion, they serve better shrimp than Boiling Crab. As for the seasoning, it tasted the same, so don't expect to be wowed. My sister wasn't in the mood to eat seafood, so she ordered chicken nuggets with Cajun fries. The chicken nuggets are not fresh, but frozen, and they taste like they've been in their fridge for weeks. So, parents beware when you take your children to this restaurant. Also, if you're the type of person that likes to wait till everyone is served, your food will definitely get cold here. They don't bring all the entrees at the same time, but what ever comes out faster from the kitchen. I was the last one to be served, so you can only imagine how much I was looking forward to their calamari. Those of you who like different type of hot sauces for your oysters, they only carry Tabasco sauce. I wouldn't recommend this place, but you be the judge!
Spectacular. Bold flavors. Unique experience. Definetly not forgettable. Tried it for the first time last week and going again tomorrow. . . The best 2lbs of hot and juicy shrimp of my life. A must in Vegas !
Went out for a late night dinner with the family and we found this place! the first thing u notice is that mouth watering smell! We ordered shrimp crab legs and crawfish. The oyster are fresh and delicious.Their hot n juicy flavor is very tasty and full of flavor! The servers are really nice and helpful. Great customer service i should say! Everybody is pretty much satisfied after the meal! Will definitely coming back to this place!
Pretty good but felt like crawfish was lacking something. Maybe lack sweetness in the meat or not alot of meat. I dont know what though... good if youve never tried it.
Staff and restaurant... clean, friendly, helpful, don't wear good clothes and certainly not WHITE.  This is a get your hands dirty kinda place.  Can be LOTS of fun if you come with the right people.
The food was pretty good. The sauce had way too much garlic though.
The crab is finger licking good.  We had the lemon pepper crab, fried shrimp and sweet potato fries.  The crab had so much flavor and spice, I really wanted some more.  The fried shrimp was alsogood, I loved the breading.  I also got a side of potato and corn to go with the crab but I feel like that should come with the bag of crab already since it was so small.  It was like half a corn and a really small potato.
FINALLY!  after seeing this on tv and after going to vegas numerous times...i finally was able to get off the strip and make it over here!  was able to cross this off my list!. . we came on a saturday night around 6PM.  there was alotta people outside already.  the wait was only about 40 mins. i expected it to be a lot longer!  . . same concept as our infamous boiling crab.  we had the shrimp and the crawfish in the hot n juicy seasoning = our shabang sauce at boiling crab.  to be honest, if i never ate boiling crab i would prob really like this.  i have to say boiling crab wins though.  our flavors are so much more intense!  we had the an order of fries= ok and the wings were ok..they reminded me of the ones from the lunch truck.  prices by pound were a lot more then what we charge here. . . service is pretty good here.  everyone is pretty attentive.  . . sorry hot n juicy but boiling crab still holds my heart!
This is my first time coming here and now I wonder why I've never been here. . . I came with a friend and she and I had a pound of shrimp and crawfish both mild and original hot n juicy seasoning. It was soo good and a like spicy but that was pretty spicy for a mild. I definitely will be coming back to try the Dungeness crab and king crab legs. . . The only reason I gave them a 3 star was bc our server wasn't the best. I'm used to having great service, which also makes the experience great and invites you to come back again. When taking our drink order she didn't even let my friend finish before taking off. When she came back to take our order, she seemed more interested looking somewhere else than paying attention. All in all she seemed rushed to take off and it wasn't even busy at all. Slow down and take your time lady.
All I have to say is omg this is a great place to come eat Cajun fries are the best and all food comes by the pound when I saw it on Man Vs food I knew it looked good but it tastes better than what it looks super fast to bring out the food and the service is the best..... if ur in Vegas it's a must!!!
awesooooooome!!!!! ask for noelle!! great service & fantastic food!!
I have dined here many times before but was disappointed today when I brought my 5 year old son in for some snow crab and king crab. Because I was dining with a child I ordered the mild garlic butter seasoning. The sauce was nothing close to mild and almost too spicy for me to enjoy.  I asked why it was a red color (garlic and butter are not red) and the server wouldn't tell me specifics and just said it was a Cajun spice blend. I didn't order the cajon seasoning flavor and from the menu choices, I chose garlic butter thinking that's all it would be. The seasonings should be explained better on the menu.
Wear a short sleeve shirt and leave the jewelry at home. This is a messy, low key, awesomely fun dining experience. I get 3 lbs. of crawfish with hot n juicy medium sauce, once a WEEK. That's how much I love this place. Every time I have friends in town, I bring them here, and I have yet to get a bad review. The staff is friendly, but busy. I always tip well; my drink is always full and they remember me :)  EAT HERE! I don't know what else to say beyond that. Yum!!
