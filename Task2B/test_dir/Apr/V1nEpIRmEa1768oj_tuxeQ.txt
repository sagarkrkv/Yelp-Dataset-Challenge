Cibo is a go to for delicious sandwiches and pizza! The saltimbocca bread is perfectly baked and so fresh. It is a cute little restaurant in an old Phoenix house with a great patio to enjoy your meal on if it is a nice day/evening. . . Personal favorites: Alla Parmigana, Caprese & Tonno Sandwiches. . Only minor thing I would have to say is on a busy day sometimes service feels understaffed. It may take a little bit to get drink refills etc. But that was only if I was being super critical, usually it is great!
Cozy and beautifully constructed lil restaurant. From the decor, to it's location, literally your local neighborhood pizza joint but without the joint-like feel. . Girlfriend and I came to the restaurant midday and we were seated promptly. Of course we chose to sit outside to not only enjoy the weather(rare in AZ since it is generally hot) but the scenery as well. I imagine it to be quite romantic had we gone at night. Nonetheless the food was great, we decided on half tartufata/capricciosa. The truffle oil in the tartufata was definitely an acquired taste because the smell of it was something else. I am by no means an expert on these types of oils but I thought it was interesting while the girlfriend thought it smelled, and not in the good way. . . I would definitely come back to not only experience the atmosphere again, but perhaps try their other pies.
After coming back from a couple dry days of hiking in the havasu indian reservation, their happy hour came to rescue! . . We loved the cute decor and neighbourhood this place is in, the service was good. . . Our friend took us here for early dinner, which happened to coincide with their happy hour offering, a buck for an arancini, polenta fries, gnocchi....all my faves...but other than the polenta fries, those dishes aren't much flavours....the house wines on the happy hour menu def good, either that, or we were just too dehydrated... :P. . pizzas were good here, the thin dough was tasty...but maybe i am used to the Chicago's heavier flavouring on the thin crusts, i found their pizzas on the bland side..the sausages toppings are good though.... . All in all, we still had a good fun time here.
Was there a couple weeks ago.. They don't take reservations for parties under six but it was a Wednesday and not that busy. Food and atmosphere was great- though the birds outside were constantly landing on our table to sneak a bite.
Very relaxing atmosphere. We sat outside and there was live music as well as lots of greenery to keep the sun off. Food came in a reasonable time and very good, but I thought it was a little overpriced. Still, it's a good place for Sunday brunch.
One of my fave restaurants in the Roosevelt district in downtown Phoenix.  The food is always fantastic. But if you can go here in the Spring or Fall - do it!  The patio has such a fantastic ambiance - one of my favorite outdoor dining places in the Valley.  Parking can be tough, but it's well worth it.
Five stars from me without a doubt. A must try!. . We chose to sit outside on a Saturday night. There was a bit of a wait, but I didn't expect to be seated right away on a weekend anyway. There was plenty of extra seating and live music, too, which made the wait more enjoyable. The patio ambiance was so nice and pretty. I'd like to check out the inside next time.. . Our waitress recommended the burrata appetizer, which was awesome and filling, but light at the same time. We ordered the Diavola and Tartufata pizzas at other Yelpers' recommendations. Of course added ricotta to the Diavola- also after reading reviews. They were both amazing. The crusts were light and crispy, the toppings were flavorful... even leftovers the next day were great! (and you WILL have leftovers) It's very hard to pick a winner, but I might go with... the Tartufata? But try both! Our waitress even told us we'd picked the best red and the best white pizzas they had.
Love coming here for lunch and dinner! Perfect for a lunch hour and good options to choose from and now offer pizza during lunch time. Absolutely love going here for dinner and the ambiance is so cozy and relaxing. Also love the fact that they have live music playing in the evenings
Whether seated inside amongst the eclectic decor or outside amongst the lit trees and occasional musician, Cibo is always an enjoyable experience. The experience includes a delicious array of salads and antipastis, a savory wine selection, brick oven pizza, lattes and desserts. In my opinion, you cannot go wrong with any item on the menu. P.S. Brunch is also a delightful affair.
He said... I'll take u to wherever u want to go.. You pick... I said Cibo!!!!!!. . . I had very high expectations for this place because everyone is always talking about it and telling me how amazing it is. I finially got a chance to try it out for the first time this past weekend.  . . So we ordered the prosciutto pizza.. I wasn't that impressed as I would hope to be. I felt like there should've been more on there. Maybe some basil, veggies, mushrooms? Something? It was just a pizza topped with some prosciutto.  I also got my favorite type of red wine. Pinot noir. Delicious. I definitely love their wine here. . . It really is a perfect spot for a date. Super romantic. Disappointed about the pizza we got but I'll definitely come back to try the others. =)
UMM... YUM! Everything I had was perfect. Super happy customer. I walked into this place a little hesitant but it's always those places that exceed your expectations! I had the vegetariano pizza highly recommend it! This place is a deff hidden gem! Go explore people, this will be worth your while :)
Fun menu with interesting selections and some standbys. Recommend outdoor seating on a cool afternoon.
Set in a historic home with what can only be described as an enchanted patio, Cibo is a romantic and rustic departure from the ordinary. It is the perfect place for a dinner date with that special someone or to reunite with friends to share an amazing meal. My favorite pizza is the Tartufata - prosciutto, mushrooms, truffle oil, simply wonderful. Stop by for a unique and exquisite dining experience.
This is another lunch pick up I tried. House-like eatery on the corner with outside seats to meet up with friends. Walked in in late afternoon. Not many people in there eating. . Saltimbocca are sandwiches. They don't serve pizza for lunch but somehow are known for pizzas. Their saltimbocca descriptions totally sound like pizza descriptions. Lol when we picked up our food we were expecting pizza boxes. They were sandwich boxes! What a let down!  We hoped that the saltimbocca will be deliciousoso!! . . Shared half of the hot Vegetariano (grilled red bell pepper, eggplant, zucchini and mozzarella) and the  porcellino (pulled BBQ pork and mozzarella). I enjoyed the vegetariano because it was all veggies and much lighter than the porcellino - which was siting on the heavy side. Also comes with a side of house salad of greens, pine nuts, red onion and shavings of cold cheese. . . I guess I'll have to try the pizza another time....for dinner. :)
I'm not understanding the recent rash of lackluster reviews. CiBo is consistently awesome, tasty and efficient. Better than  Bianco without the three hour wait. Adorable setting, great staff and beautifully community minded, holding yearly fundraising events for local charities. CiBo is the real deal, and if you folks who left bad reviews don't come back? More pizza for me!. . Ps- zeppoli? Heck yes.
Hello again. Ate here last nite. Myself and 2 firends. 3x's ive been here and its always busy. the other two x's we attempted to eat here. We didnt want to wait, so we went some where eles to eat. Last nite we waited for about 30minutes.  We were seated inside. and quickly ordered. I had the omero salad, one firend had sausage pizza and a glase of wine, and the other had pear salad. . Ok food arrived promptly. my salad was good a bit on the small side for 11 dollars, but had lots of greens and onions, strawberries, and walnuts. it was good. my only complaint would be the candied walnuts........... couldnt even taste the walnuts too much sugar. When mentioned this too the waittress; She informed me that i could of requested plain raw walnuts and without any problem they could replace the candied walnuts with raw ones. That was nice to know. for the next time. My two firends both loved their food. I just thought mine and my firends salad were on the small side for 11 and 12 dollars. Other then that. Every thing at Cibo was very good. i recommend giving this establishment a try. I will be back. Just be prepared to spend 20 dollars or more. per person. Also depending on what time of day you go, be prepared to wait for a seat very popular with the  local folk. Lots of parties and groups coming and going. They serve wine and beer. not a full bar.  good place for eye candy of the both sexes. All ages here young and old.  Very nice atmosphere.. . If if they offered organic whole wheat pizza they would get another star from me.
I recently was helped by Jordan Leugers at 5114s Rural Rd., Tempe.  I would like to say that I was very pleased with the help I got from Jordan.  He was very patient with me as I asked questions about my new phone.. . It is great to know that any future questions that I may have I can go to the store and get the help I need.. . Toni R..

This is a quaint spot, which undoubtedly was once someone's residence. You try to figure out which room is which as you walk in, picturing a TV or a sofa in the corner. You feel like you are having dinner and your buddy's house with his folks preparing a meal. We showed up for a late lunch, no wait or crowd. Pizza was fabulous. Nice texture to the crust, a little floppy so using a fork isn't out of the question. My son had the crepe, which looked amazing and tasted just as good. I would imagine parking could be beastly during a rush, since you are in a neighborhood, so plan accordingly.
This pizza is fantastic, probably my favorite in Phoenix, though that's very hard to name. I also love the location, both inside and outside is fantastic.  The whole menu is fantastic. It's a great place for a date-night, or to bring friends visiting town, or to go with a small party, if you can either make reservations for a large group or wait it out.  Everyone must check this place out at least once!
I really wanted to like Cibo as soon as we walked up to it. The outdoor patios are lovely and such a nice setting. We went Sunday during brunch time and I was a little worried that they wouldn't have their pizza as I read a few reviews (old ones) that said that they didn't serve PIzza. For the record, they do.. . We ordered their margherita pizza and M&M. The margherita pizza was OK, nothing too special. It was also a little salty in my opinion. I was kind of hoping for some freshly grated parmesan too instead of the powdered kind. The M&M was good though, but not something I would go out of my way to get.
Lunch at Cibo's was amazing. I had their PLT and it was, quite simply, delicious!. Toasted Prosciutto, with tomatoes, fresh greens, and a spicy aoli..my taste buds were very happy with me. . I added fresh mozzarella to mine.. . I would highly recommend this place to everyone and anyone!
Went with friends on a Sunday after seeing all the raving reviews for it. I loved the outdoor patio area, which was spacious yet intimate. We sat under a giant red umbrella which hid my Asian glow fairly well. For the record, their bellinis are awesome.. . The Fritatta Melfitana I ordered was good. Maybe I had too high of an expectation or something but I didn't think it was that special. Perhaps their pizzas would blow my mind.
Great food!  Don't pass this one up.
Stopped in for a late night bite on a Friday, and loved every minute of it. The ambiance is amazing, the staff was so helpful and the food was delish!! . . Mom isn't a big fan of pizza, but ask her now and she'll just rave about Cibo's pizza. That alone says a lot!
consistently tasty!
WOW! Great place to relax and have some good food! My new Favorite in Phoenix for Italian! Great Salads! Great Wine!
Cibo's is such a fantastic experience, AND you have the bonus of a great food as well. My family and I frequently eat brunch on Sunday mornings. There is a variety of options available to meet the varied needs of our large party, and there is an ambiance which is so relaxing and filled with life all at the same time.. Whether I've gone there in the morning, afternoon, or evening, the experience is never the same, except for attending service, exceptional food, and frequently live entertainment. . You will not be disappointed in your experience and meal at Cibo's.

Quaint and adorable. Great service and the food was good. Lots of great vegetarian options  which I am not but my friend is! This is a great place for a date night or a girl's night with wine, food & chit chat!
