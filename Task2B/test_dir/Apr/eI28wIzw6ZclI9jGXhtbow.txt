You have to go into this show knowing that it's dirty, gritty, disgusting, offensive, and downright terrible - in the BEST way.. . If you're easily offended, the humor is NOT for you. It's almost too raunchy even for me, and it makes the worst episodes of South Park look mild. But if that's your cup of tea (and it is mine), it's absolutely hysterical. The characters are lovable, in their own disgusting, racist, offensive ways.. . The chairs and decor are all mismatched and probably stolen from yard sales and crappy antique stores. They're not very comfortable, but there's not a bad seat in the house. I prefer to get a table, because if you're close to the front of the seats, you WILL get picked on. Lots of audience, uhhh... participation? Verbal assault? Either one.. . It's a variety act, and all of the acts are incredible. The fact that they do their acts in a fairly tiny space just adds to the wonder and amazement. They're all terrifying, gravity defying, and honestly pretty freakin sexy.. . Every night the house cocktail is different. $10 a pop but you only need one to stumble out of there at the end. I've seen this show twice, and the first time, the drink was lemonade and vanilla vodka (so gross but so strong), and last time it was OJ, orange vodka, grenadine, and amaretto. That one tasted a lot better and got me even drunker.. . All in all, if you can enjoy something that is absolutely trashy, you will find that Absinthe is a treasure.
This show is absolutely AMAZING!!  I want to fly back to Vegas just to see this show again.  LOVE!  Can't say enough positive things about it.  SO funny; if you love to laugh and are easy going then this is definitely the show for you.  Inappropriate for sure... I laughed so hard that I was crying.
LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT, this show was hysterical and amazing at the same time.  Honestly one of the best shows I have seen in Vegas (ever).  The dynamic between the "gazillionaire" and his assistant was incredibly funny, entertaining from start to finish.  The acrobatic feats performed by these entertainers is absolutely incredible.  We really liked the intimate seating and small theater setting, being able to be so close makes this absolutely that much more amazing because you can see how hard these performers are concentrating - we saw the show 2 days ago and have been telling everyone to go see this - way better than all of the cirque shows (and we have seen all of them) and I will totally go back and see this one again.  Really enjoyed it - word to the wise, if you don't like foul language or sexual orientated jokes then you will not  like this show, not good for kids at all, they abuse and crack on all races, ethnicities and sexual orientations, nobody is immune from being made fun of so if you can deal with that, then you will like this show
All sorts of inappropriate, but hilarious! They had a nice mix of acts and everything moved quickly enough so that it did not get boring. Certainly entertaining, I would definitely go again.
This show was an amazing combination of acrobatics and comedy.  Not PG or PC but hilarious.  The personal feel and small venue makes this a must do in Vegas.
If you find yourself in LV wander over to Cesar's Palace and take a front row seat in the tent. This show will not disappoint. My bf and I loved the crude comedy, amazing human tricks and sexy lady. I would suggest not being cheap and sitting in the front row the show is interactive and you will love it. Bring your sense if humor and leave your sensitive shy self at the door. Amazing show don't miss it!
I loved it! Yes, it will be crude andrude to some. After reading the previous reviews I expected much worse. Loved Penny. She cracked me up. It was a fast 90 min. I coulda gone for more.
I was surprised at how good this shown was because my expectations were not that high. The atmosphere is intimate under a tent show you are right on top of the performance. It was a rated R version of Cirque De Solei. Very funny at times and impressive talent via acrobatics etc. Great times and worth going to see.
Absinthe is the best show of all time for the non republicans. Lol..... It is so inn appropriate but freaking hilarious. I could not stop laughing. Very pricy if you are not local but is so worth the money. I will definitely go back as much as possible because its that great!!!!!!
Attended the show last night and I enjoyed every second of it! Every act in this crazy circus is very entertaining and talented! The host and April are too funny and had me laughing all night long! Definitely recommend and might even attend again next time I'm in town! Great job Absinthe!
Attended the show this weekend and I've read many of the reviews on Yelp which is why we picked this show.  I won't rehash what's already been said... but I will explain why I gave the show 3 stars.. . Pros:. 1.  Cool, intimate setting.  I was not bothered by the chairs or the close proximity of my neighbors.. 2.  Hilarious show...  the acts were enjoyable and some amazing.  Disappointed that we didn't get to see the rollerbladers.. 3.  We laughed a lot.  The humor is very off-color (but very stereotypically color related).  . . Cons:. 1.  Non-tiered seating.  We were in the 5th row and it was very hard to see.  I think the seats w/ tables in the back of the venue are likely the best seats.. 2.  The show is very disjointed.  Although funny, the banter between the hosts really seems not at all related to the show.  The stunts are worth seeing but it does seem that the crude (and really funny) banter cheapens the show.. 3.  90 minutes is extremely short for $100 seats.  . . Overall I would say the show was just meh....  I would rate it higher if the show was longer OR the seats were cheaper.. . Likely better shows in Vegas to see.
I am not a fan of circus acts.. . I've seen enough tumblers, tight rope walkers, and contortionists to last a lifetime.. . However, while this show does indeed center around circus acts, it incorporates a host and hostess so funny and engaging I would watch a show featuring just them.. . The Gazillionaire and Penny are funny as hell, engaging, and just plain awesome to watch. . . The intimacy of the tent also made the circus acts fun to watch, even for me.. . Great party atmosphere and a great time!
This was my first ever show in Vegas and I loved it. This is a erotic, acrobatic show that mirrors a Circus du Soleil show. The acrobatics are awesome and the Ring Leader and is Assistant are so funny. The show takes place in a small, intimate big top setting. When we bought the tickets, we opted for the show with dinner. The dinner was at Planet Hollywood (which was totally not worth a dime), but the seats we got at Absinthe were totally worth it! The stage is set around a small circular stage. There are about 10-15 rows of wooden seats around that, then a walkway and then a slightly higher section with probably 10 seats that are cushioned. We had seats in two cushioned armchairs that seamed to be the plushest in the place. We were in the last row, but sitting there for over an hour, those seats seemed to be the best. It's a small venue, so the view was just fine. . The humor was raunchy, but truly entertaining.  I would recommend this show to anyone that wants a "Vegas" experience. The performers were a class act!
The only word for this show is "hilarious"! The show is in the tent between Bellagio and Caesar's so it's a pretty convenient location. The tickets for general admission are $99 and if you want to pay more, you can sit at a table and get a split of champagne.. . The seating is the only drawback of the show. It is very intimate, so there isn't a bad seat in the house but there is very little cushion so by the end, your butt is pretty sore. The acts are absolutely incredible- from death defying skaters to a contortionist using aerial straps to a "lesbian couple" flinging one another over the crowd.. . As for Penny and the Gazillionaire, I found them hilarious and a good segway between acts. Some criticisms from other reviewers are that it felt disjointed and had nothing to do with the show. I have to disagree.The performers need time to get ready between acts, to set up the harnesses and other equipment. The lively and crude banter is a great way to distract from that. I laughed so hard I cried! This is my favorite show in Vegas, hands down!
I was reluctant to go to this show since I'm not into crass humor as mentioned below. But I found this hysterical and the performers were amazing.
This show was awesome! The decor and ambience were very cool. We had great seats, and it looked like there was not a bad seat in the entire place. The bad reviews are written by people who obviously lack a true sense of humor. This is Vegas, so if you're offended by crude humor, you came to the wrong city! I cried from laughing so hard, then again I find crude humor hilarious. Every act had me watching anxiously because of how risky some of them were, but it was equally mind-blowing and entertaining. $100 for a 90 minute show is well worth it. Why would you want to spend more than 90 minutes sitting anyways? I highly recommend this show to everyone.
Everything about this show was over the top from the amazing stunts and acts to the hilariously offensive jokes. This show had me laughing my butt off when I wasn't staring in awe at the talent of the performers. There is a ton of sexuality peppered in along with the audience being made fun of by the MC so if you are easily offended this show isn't for you. However if you like raunchy comedy, feats of skill and hot bodies this is the show for you.
An absolute must-see if you're in Vegas!  The acts are world-class (not saying anything about what does or doesn't happen, because I don't want to give anything away) and the Gazillionaire and his sidekick Penny will leave you in stitches.. . That said, if you aren't a fan of crude humor, or don't have a sense of humor at all, don't come.  Seriously, don't.  You'll be miserable.  Absinthe holds the lead in the "most F-bombs in a show on the Strip" category, and it isn't close.. . Some things you need to know: the chairs are very uncomfortable to sit in, and if you're in the seats in the 6(?) rows around the stage, you'll be right, right next to the people on either side of you.  Also, there isn't much of an incline.  We sat at a table in the outside ring and loved our seats. Believe me, the tent isn't large, and you'll be able to easily see everything.. . Also, if you're in the first rows closest to the stage and/or a racial minority, expect to get picked on or even pulled on stage.  Again, this is a COMEDY SHOW.  See my note above about what to do if you don't have a sense of humor.  The Gazillionaire mercilessly picked on a guy because he refused to laugh, and it only got worse (to the amusement of everyone else, of course!) for him as the show went on.. . In sum: GO.  Laugh.  Gasp at the acts.  Laugh some more.  Leave after 90 minutes happy, and just hope you aren't going to hell for laughing TOO hard.
A must see in Vegas!  The showwas a lot of fun and the perfect way to start a Vegas vacation. The show felt like Zumanity on a budget. They knew they couldn't pull off that show so the acts are complemented by a lot of humor and raunchy randomness. You will laugh throughout the entire show. Highly recommended!
If you're a bit on the broke side, but want to catch a vegas show then Absinthe is a MUST! Actually, I would still go see this show even if I wasn't broke. My bf & I went early to get tickets at the tix4tonight booth so they were fairly cheap. Just a tip so that you won't be noob like us, the tickets don't have assigned seating. So no need to get to the ticket booth super early in the morning like us thinking we'll get better seats that way. The seating is basically first come first serve.. . The show takes place inside the tent at Caesar's palace near Serendipity. So essentially it's pretty small inside so there's no bad seats. Definitely beats the free circus act shows at Circus Circus. Such a great adult comedy show with Cirque stunts and props. There's a lot of profanity and vulgar language here, but it's hilarious and entertaining. Even with seeing some Cirque Du Soleil shows I would get bored or lose attention for a bit, but with Absinthe I never once got bored. I was always laughing and engaged.. . There's so much humor to this, yet randomness at the same time. I actually thought this was better than Zarkana
Believe the ad: if you only see one show, make it Absinthe. I'm a Las Vegas local and have seen it twice. My girlfriend has seen it 4 times. It never gets old. Acts are fresh, the hosts improv, and there isn't a bad seat in the venue. Every time I have family or friends in town, this is the show we take them to. Worth every penny.
This is the show to see in las vegas by far. I've seen 4 circ shows and quite a few others in town and this show is the top one in town. The show itself is meant for adults and those who don't like adult humor please don't go. Everything in the show I really liked but the chairs in the venue. It wasn't really an issue because everything else in the show was great. It's about the same price a circ show without all the fluff. Don't think about going if you are in las vegas....just go.
