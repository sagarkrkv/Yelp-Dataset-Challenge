The absolute last time I will fly sky harbor. I just threw out over $100 of products that I have never once, ever, in I don't know how many years of flying, in how many airports had trouble with! I'm livid. This place is the biggest traffic jam (altering my words here) I have ever seen! I had employees telling me I needed to go to an entirely different airline and I had a straight flight - not true! Then after they convinced me I needed to check my bag in order to keep my products that I had to go all the way back and check it in. I said I have been here for 45 mins at this point, there is no way I would make it back they said if I didn't have 45 min to my flight I would have to throw all this stuff out. Then they sent me aimlessly down a hallway where I needed to lug my stuff up two flights of stairs to the most crowded crappy, dirty disorganized boarding mess I've ever seen. NOW they are saying they may need to check my bag as they have run out of room for carry ons, which they are able to do from here. The intercom system is so hard to hear then they are talking over each other so you have no clue what they are saying.  . I have now paid MORE for a longer flight in an uncomfortable airport with an over booked flight!!!. AND I can't imagine there is anyway we will take off in the next ELEVEN minutes since they have yet to begin boarding the plane...no one...not started...at all...ELEVEN MINUTES!. Worst flight experience I've ever had - United and Sky Harbor are no longer part of my travel plans!
Airport is okay.  General service has been par.  Wish they had charging stations scattered throughout gate seating instead of just isolate charging stations.. . Food and store selections are above average.. . Reviewed based on Southwest terminal D.
If I could give my experience at this airport a zero I would. US Airways customer service is terrible!!! After my original flight (flying United) couldn't check me in for my final layover (with US Airways), they could me I couldn't get on the flight because it was boarding. I still had about 30 mins or so for it to take off. Without offering to see if I could fly with another airline or see any other options (beside booking me for the next morning flight). The rep was rude and a little snotty. These people need to take a class on customer service!
This is my home airport and honestly I think it is one of the best airports there are. If I had to spend hours in an airport it would be at the top of my list...it literally has the best places to eat/sit/drink/get a coffee. The best phoenix restaurants like Matts Big Breakfast, Chelsea's Kitchen, Sauce etc...best places to eat of most airports. I actually come early just to eat lol. And people are friendly, things 95% of the time. move extremely fast. Outside of long weekends/holidays I am usually from the curb to my gate within half an hour (don't try that JIC but it's true) and it's in the middle of the city so extremely easy to get to and navigate once inside. Happy travels!
The new restaurants in Terminal 4 and updates of the US Airways Clubs have this place looking a lot nicer! Much better than the Philadelphia hub. The sky train is an easy way to park and get to the airport. It truly is America's Friendliest Airport!
Probably the worst airport in terms of signage in the US. The arrivals screen doesn't state the baggage claim area. Once you exit the airport there are no signs to find a taxi. Who designed this airport??
Nice airport. Clean, not too big, staff are nice enough. Security doesn't take an insane amount of time, which is nice.
Pretty standard medium airport. We fly in andout infrequently and never hate the place, but never find ourselves wishing we flew through more often.
I've flown in and out of here on southwest and now delta... I've got to say that the delta terminal is amazing. Everything was perfect from TSA to even charging stations. Keep it up Sky Harbor staff was friendly! Can't wait to fly in and out of here again!
great airport, the Delta Terminal sucks!!! Hey Delta, how about becoming serious about your SkyHarbor customers?
I hated our terminal.  We were flying out of Southwest and were Gate C I believe.  There was only 1 bathroom within the whole area, and not many food options.  But I have flown out of Phoenix plenty of times and it has been better in other terminals.
Super Busy Airport. Every gate is packed. Food lines are off the hook. SFO is huge and I have never seen so many long lines. Need some expansion.
When I came here at the end of marchthe lines were very long and the airport seemed disorganized. Staff was nice but the airport was very backed up compared to other airports
As far as airports go, this one is really easy to get in and out of. Either way: Picking people up, or taking off for fun and adventure, this place is pretty convenient. No complaints here! Nothing even remotely close to the nightmares such as LAX or San Francisco Intl. This place is a piece of cake. Not sure if other airports have these cell phone lots, but this is a new con convenient deal. You park in a special lot with a giant sign that reports when all flights are either in the air or have arrived. You hang out and wait for your friends and family to arrive, THEN you start cruising the pickup area looking for your passengers.
Rental car facility is far from airport, dining is on the wrong side of security! It is BEFORE you go through security and nobody wants to grab a bite before you go through security because you never know how long it will take ..........you just know it will be long. One TSA person on a Sunday afternoon checking IDs, really? So stupid but they don't have to care so that's what you get. Definitely not passenger friendly.
This airport makes no sense and has gotten to big for its britches.  The gates layout sucks and you can't tell who is coming or going.  It is hot and there are very limited charging stations.  The TSA folks all had their Cheerios peed in and were very rude.  The rental car area while nice is a 20min bus ride.  All in all not a fan for this sometimes necessary evil airport.
I enjoy the eateries and the shopping. TSA can be very aggregating, but not that much more than other airports. . . The SkyTrain is a big upgrade to the airport and lessens the necessary traffic near the terminals. It can be boarded at the Light Rail/ outer cell phone lot and from the East Long Term Parking. . . Terminal 4 has nice restaurants and shops giving it the feel of a mall more than an airport.
This airport is a bitch to get around walking or driving. Everything is marked and the layout is horrible.
Holy 7 hells it is HOT in here! Pretty sure they have no air conditioning,  everyone around me is complaining how grossly hot it is in here.... I mean I know we're in a hot hot hot climate but all we can see are a few fans around to circulate the warm air...and when you have tp hike it all the way to the end of the concourse,  you get sweaty and no longer look nice when you're supposed to look decent for traveling and first class.  . . Down the A gates concourse,  there is a "US Airways Club" near gate A20, that if you have a membership for, I'm sure it's luxurious. I think you can purchase day passes as well, not sure. The bathrooms down this way are even more hot and stagnant,  definitely not a good mixture in a restroom... I wish the stalls were taller, and longer in the ladies room, more like Chicago O'Hare... or the newly renovated beautifully luxurious bathrooms at Minneapolis-St.Paul airport... the gaps in the stall are so creepily large that it doesn't make a lady feel very private.. Also down by the A gates there is are a few choices for food, none of which I stopped to try..I think there was a pub, a fast food Asian, and one with hamburgers.. also a cute coffee place, and then you will also find a souvenirs shop with lits of little trinkets and treasures for you to buy ladt minute before you head home after your Arizonian Vacay.
Good airport.  Delta terminal 3 doesn't currently use the full body scanner which is nice considering I always opt out!  I wish I'd had more time to look around but the time it takes to get to the rental car area doesn't leave you much wiggle room.  The shuttles seem to be constantly running which is a plus.  I miss Phoenix already!
No matter how any times they tell me that this is the friendliest airport over the PA system, it still doesn't make it true... . The good thing is that the security lines are short the majority of the time.
Heads up, the rental car terminal is 100 miles away from the airport. Not really, but it sure seems like it.
Just keep driving, you'll eventually find your way out of Terminal 3! Smh. . . I picked up a family member who needed wheelchair service. And we needed an attendant with a baggage cart. Both gentlemen were very friendly, and accomodating. Thanks Phoenix Sky  Harbor, and Delta!
This place just brings the rage out in me. It NEVER fails..whenever I have a layover here, my flight gets pushed back three times for an average delay of 3-4 hours...so you don't get out of there till almost 1am!! For a DOMESTIC flight! Thanks, US Airways! . . The food court is pretty gross, still. The staff at the Starbucks over by B15A is pretty rude and then the departure screens don't update when your gate has been changed. I usually end up extremely stressed out by the time I'm outta this hell hole. Sadly, PHX is ALWAYS the place I have to connect through to get home because US Airways seems to love torturing their guests with this location. And...for an airport in an extremely hot place, how do you not have your HVAC system working properly?!
For an airport that bills itself as "friendliest", it is significantly short on customer friendly signage/directories regarding food offerings across the terminals.  This lack of directory availability within each terminal leaves the customer uninformed, standing in long lines for the few choices immediately visible and creates an overall less than delightful experience.   I hope my travels don't bring me through this airport anytime soon, I know I will book accordingly to avoid it.  Customer service goes well beyond trying a staff to say "Welcome to Phoenix" and "Have a good day".
My layover here was pretty good! There's lots of charge stations which is cool and outlets everywhere.. A lot were in the wall so people would have to stand/sit by them but at least they have outlets available, haha.. . Bathrooms are clean. I was only here for about 2 1/2 hours so I was charging my phone and on it most of the time. The food places look cute but didn't personally eat any of them. It looks nice outside. That was basically my whole experience.. . Also it's 90 degrees outside. I came from rainy SFO with shorts and a hoodie but it's nice and air conditioned in the airport, whew?
If you fly from the C or D terminal, bring food or be prepared to spent plenty if very mediocre good. . And bring a book because you WILL be delayed by the gross incompetence in Phoenix. From here, none if my flights have ever left on time.. At least the place is clean......
America's friendliest airport and my home town. They do it right here and are very efficient. You'll love the restaurants. Try Cartel Coffee for the best latte in town. I also think the new Humble Pie looks amazing.
I plan to officially file a complaint but have to share.  Bought duty free in Cabo to bring home as a gift, tequila, wrapped and sealed.  I get through international check, customs, first transfer airline and then in Phoenix they take the bottle.  I as why and they say it is a hazmat threat.  Are you kidding me, someone just wanted to go drinking that night.  I said how can it make it through customs into the US from Mexico without a problem and suddenly it could be a weapon of mass destruction.  No one could believe it.  I asked Supervisor Fisher what he was going to do with the bottle and he said put it in the OFFICIAL HAZMAT CONTAINMENT UNIT.  That ended up being a 2 foot by 2 foot safe.  Do they not know how stupid they look when they pull stunts like this,  REALLY
