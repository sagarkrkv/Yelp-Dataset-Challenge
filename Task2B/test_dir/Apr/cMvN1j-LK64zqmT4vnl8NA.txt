China Poblano was the first restaurant I ate at after arriving in Las Vegas, NV. We couldn't find Secret Pizza at the time, so we decided to eat here. The hostess kindly seated us immediately. The menu has a variety of items. We ordered fried wontons, queso fundido, and chicken ji song (lettuce wraps). The chicken ji song was my favorite dish. China Poblano lettuce wraps was fresh and the ingredients blended well together. The fried wontons and queso fundido was average at best in my opinion. I chose mango sticky rice for dessert. China Poblano sticky rice was innovative compared to other restaurants I've visited. The unique spin on the mango sticky rice was cool literally (served cold). I enjoyed every bite of my mango sticky rice. The sticky rice is perfect for a hot Las Vegas day. Our server wasn't very attentive (restaurant was not busy). We had to flag her down for refills constantly. The ambience at China Poblano is awesome. It's a good place for drinks and enjoying the Cosmopolitan eye candy. I personally expected more from some of the dishes but they didn't hit the spot for me. The presentation of meals deserves two thumbs up! I give China Poblano a 2.5 rating.
Service is great! But we went home hungry after spending almost $60! Very expensive and very small portions! Nothing special.
China Poblano. Asian and/or Mexican?Tomato Tomatoooo.. . I was in Las Vegas for work recently. Vegas is not my favorite place. I'm not into seeing woman being pathetically objectified, losing money, or big flashing lights while I'm trying to catch my zzzzs.. . That being said, the food in this town is outstanding! China Poblano was recommended to me by someone I met at a bar while in town. I had a friend accompany me on this dining adventure. And an adventure it was!. . The restaurant is located in one of the fancier malls. Not the most elegant place, but colorful and cheery instead. The food is, as the waitress explained, "both Chinese and Mexican, not fusion." Okay, interesting!. . We started with drinks... the Salt Air Margharita. Hands down, this is the best cocktail I've ever had. It was foamy and lovely and lightly salted and oh my! may I have another?  Apparently, they have a to-go window. You can walk right up and grab one of these spectular drinks as you puruse the fancy shops. . . . Mexican cuisine was served first then the Chinese. Dish after dish. Different aromas, tastes. It was a trip around the world in my mouth. Heavenly!. . I want to mention that the service was Incredible as well. . . For the perfect night, pair dinner at China Poblano with an after-dinner drink at the Chandelier bar next door. Yep, order fancy cocktails and listen to live jazz while sitting inside the largest chandelier. Too cool!
I had a really incredible lunch here that was a pleasant surprise. I almost didn't eat here due to the mediocre reviews but I am so glad that I gave it a chance! . . We were looking for a lighter, healthy lunch, not an easy thing to find in Las Vegas. We ended up at China Poblano as there weren't many other options near by. . . I thought it was going to be a mix of Chinese and Mexican flavors but it was actually just a combination of Chinese and Mexican dishes. . . The shrimp mojo was incredible. Eight shrimp were smothered in a yummy black garlic sauce that had a great kick with green poblanos. The tuna ceviche was another winner. Amaranth seeds gave it a nice crunch, but it was just a tad too salty. . . The beet salad was beautiful, simple and small. Pieces of beets, oranges and avocado were topped with slivers of pickled onion and an orange dressing. . . The golden pig dim sum was my least favorite item. They were super sweet and there wasn't enough meat in them. . . Overall service was very friendly. Food was great. It was surprisingly expensive as a lot of other reviewers have commented. I would come back but I'd skip the buns!
This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Every time I go, I tried to order something new exciting and different to me. I have my staples that I order every time such as the Viva Chinna taco which includes crispy beef tendon and lightly poached oysters. Delicious. The carnitas are very tender and flavorful, and served with a salsa cruda and pork rind on top. This visit my fiancee and I tried the steamed pork buns and quail egg shu mai for the first time, and both were immediate favorites! The buns were filled with sweet and slightly spiced barbecue pork, perhaps a little too sweet, but the toothy chewy dough made a great balance. The shu mai is something I will order again and recommend heavily.. there was delicious and delicate minced filling in a tender dumpling with a just very slightly steamed quail egg nestled right in the top of each one. It made for one epic mouth experience, salty and creamy with an appealing texture. The agua fresca was a perfect compliment.
San Fran meets Tijuana in Las Vegas.. Reasonable prices for delicious variants of Chinese and Mexican fare.  My table tried 2 noodle dishes (1 hot / 1 cold) and 1 rice dish.  Well done!. The air margaritas was interesting.  The salt was whipped into the airy topping.  So let your lips touch each sip to enjoy the salt with your drink.
NO! Walking by this place makes you think it's fast food but of course it's at the Cosmopolitan so it wasn't cheap and we were wrong! Can't give much review on the food because after we saw it was $14 for two tacos we got up and left. If you're a rich bitch, it's a great place for you but if not there's a taco place next to twin peaks on the strip that's amazing!! :)
We live in Vegas and have enjoyed dozens of restaurants from fine to walk ups. Rarely do we not get a good meal. We tried this one on a Sunday afternoon and should have turned around as soon as the snotty hostess  seated us next to the silverware station when very few of the tables were occupied. We asked a few questions about the menu and were told, "You have to order bunches of them." Tacos were $10.50 to 5.85. After seeing the tiny taco at the next table I ordered the shrimp and ham with cellophane noodles. My wife ordered salt and pepper tofu. What I got was a small bowl of tasteless soup with two shrimp, that I had to de head, and some tofu. My wife got four small pieces of tofu on a plate. Without drinks we spent $40 dollars and were hungry and angry we'ed been had.
First, I want to say Yelp needs to provide instructions on how to review, and impose a limit on how long the review should be because there's no need to write 1000 word essay raving about a place, and then deduct stars for some mundane thing like price or a mistake on a bill that was corrected with a smile. Anyway, my experience was excellent, the food was very good, drinks were delicious, service was amazing-all of the suggestions were spot on. I can't remember the names of everything I had but it was all delightful, and I have no complaints.  Eat here!  it's yummy!
Not Asian, not Mexican, not a great blend of both either. Lackluster combinations don't make fusion cuisine. Best thing here was probably the guacamole. . . Okay, so it's tapas style. Plates are super small, prices add up quickly. Tacos were about $5each, so yikes. They also advertise an original hot sauce, but I'm under the impression that it's actually Guilin hot sauce.. . You're probably looking to spend $25+ per person here for not-so-inspirational food. I recommend you go somewhere else.
Tacos were very good, but extremely over priced and small. $5.50 per taco?! I've had better for $1.25.
This is a late review from our dining experience back in February.  . . Fusion at it's best.   Mexican and Chinese such a great combination resulting in excellent food!   Since we were a party of 5 we were able to try several dishes.    Must try dishes: tuna ceviche, langosta and carnitas tacos, quail egg Sui Mai and the 20 vegetable fried rice.   The salt air margarita is a must try drink.
We loved China Polano!!  It was perfect for our group of 4.  We thought it would be a fusion of Chinese and Latin foods, but it was pretty much split down the middle of half Chinese foods and half Latin foods.  We went for the pork, ribs and refried bean tacos (loved them all, especially the pork and bean tacos!).  Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs because we also ordered the fresh guacamole and chips, beans, cheese, chips, pork bao, and the mongolian beef.  There were lots of ooos and ahhs from our table as these foods were comforting and all so tasty!  We were so impressed!  I can't wait to come back here again next time I am in Vegas!!
Nothing particularly wrong with the food, but the total experience didn't knock my socks off. The guacamole was freshly prepared and quite good as was the chipotle salsa. You need to keep in mind that you're eating at a small plates/tapas style restaurant.  Prices are a bit inflated given this setting. The Siu Mai and vegetable fried rice were delicious, but the tacos were not very impressive. Overall, the price was disproportionate to the overall experience.
We were running late on a concert night at the Cosmo and it was a rare show where we actually cared about the opening act, so time was of the essence.   While doing a yelp search from the elevator we decided upon China Poblano as:. . 1) "Tacos sound kinda good right now". 2) "It's Jose Andres!   That dude's been on Bourdain and Top Chef so he's legit". and. 3) "It gets 3 stars on Yelp!  That means it's gotta be....   wait, 3 stars?!?"  . . So we went anyway even though a straight up 3 is typically below my snooty Yelp threshold of place to visit.   I'm glad we did.    We started by looking at some signature cocktails presented to us that arent on the main menu.   I wanted the Aviation which has been one of my go-to drinks lately, and my lady friend wanted something I don't remember the name of, but it was something that didnt sound very "manly" like "the Snow Willow"   or "The Kitten's Purr"   It had cucumber as a main fixture and didn't sound appealing at all to me.    Naturally my friend ordered my drink for me and forced me to order the other one.   I tried both and all I'll say is, the Aviation was delicious! Quick wait service update:  After we put in the drink order, our waiter disappeared for what I felt was a long time.   We sat without drinks and without placing our order for I'd say a good 12 minutes.   We were definitely looking left and right for a trace of him as if we were trying to jaywalk across a busy intersection.   . . So given that we had a bit of a break, I went to Yelp to try to find some recommendations.   I went with 4 tacos (they're small and I'm big).   and my dining companion went with Mongolian Beef Lettuce.    As long as we had to wait to get our drinks and orders in, the wait for the food was exceptionally as short.   It seemed like only 5 minutes had passed before a few of my tacos from my order arrived, and only a few minutes after that the Mongolian Beef Lettuce showed up.   . . For my 2nd list of the review, here are all 4 tacos I ordered and ate. . 1)  Lengua (beef tongue) -  delicious as beef tongue usually is.   Melt in your mouth, well seasoned.  . 2)  Viva China (beef tendon/oysters) - disappointed in this one as the reviews seemed highly favorable.   I must admit I'm not a HUGE oyster fan, but to me the flavors of the oysters and the tendon just didn't co-mingle well.   . 3) Carnitas - my favorite.   the pork was tender and delicious and I loved the contrast the crunch and flavor of the pork rinds provided.. 4) I cant find the 4th one I ordered on the menu.   Either that or I had too much of that cucumber drink and lost my mind accordingly.   It was some sort of beef short rib with some sort of chile I thought.   It was tasty and the chile brought a lot of smoky flavor to it.   It didn't really offer up anything unique enough for me to want to order it again though. . Overall I was very happy with my meal of tacos as a whole.   The tortillas are made to order and taste fantastic.   We actually ordered some on the side to go with the Mongolian Beef Lettuce.  As for that dish I thought I was a bit underwhelming.   The beef was flavorful and it tastes exactly how its described in the menu with the ginger/soy/vinegar components, but there just wasn't any extra oomph to justify spending nearly $20 on it.   The tacos, albeit small, are well worth the $5.50 a piece they generally command.   I like the idea that you could just come in here, grab a drink and a few tacos and be in and out in a reasonable time (if your waiter doesnt take an extended break like ours seemed to) for about $20, or go all out and share a bunch of dishes for an extravagant (and expensive) meal.   Not many places, especially at the Cosmo, give you that option.
Jose Andres is always a name you associate with good and original food but this time was not what we expected . Actually not fusion is Chinese or Mexican and ok food . Guacamole was good and very limited menu for someone allergic to shellfish so that alone is not to Mexican
Came here for lunch.. . Atmosphere - great and good for a large group. . Service - friendly and appropriate. Drinks- tried the salted air margarita - also excellent.  Instead of the salt around the glass it was a cloud. Of salt air which is perfect as you get the best ratio of salt to margarita without it being overwhelming.. . Food - Setas tacos (mushroom). Amazing! Best tortilla I have ever had, can taste the freshness and I am usually not a fan of corn tortillas.  Mushrooms were seasoned great in an adobo like sauce on a bed of guacamole which was perfect.  The right amount of seasoning and spice.. . 20 veggies fried - yes 20 different types of veggies are in it, who knew fried rice could be so good.  A must order and if you like spice ask for a side of the chili sauce.. . Churros- excellent, not too greasy and the chocolate dayes was fluffy and not too thick. . . Overall a great meal
