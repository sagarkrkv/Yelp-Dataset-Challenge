The atmosphere is great with live music and your typical party revelry. All of this makes for a great time as you enjoy your liter of dunkel beer. That is until your food arrives. If you are expecting German food than just stop. Go away. It's at best German inspired food. This place is the Taco Bell of German food. It's flat out terrible and a disgrace to the Hofbrau name. Come for the atmosphere and the beer but please don'tcome for the food and especially don't judge German food based upon this place. Did I mention it was terrible?  I give this place 3 stars because it was a great time and an absolute blast...despite the food.
Hofbrauhaus. because of the spanking I couldn't sit for 2 days. SO WORTH IT. For many years, I have driven by and never stepped foot in. One hungover morning, I decided screw it. I'm going in! 20 of us showed up and it was beautiful. Huge ceilings. ALL GERMAN EVERYTHING. Got spanked. Purchased a glass boot to drink my beer out of. Beautiful wooden tables and beer garden. Ordered the "wurst" special a carousel of weiners and pretzels. You really can't go wrong with anything that you order. I guarantee a FUN TIME. The performers are excited and the joke mans are very interactive. Employees are dressed everyday for the part. Make it a point to stop in. Definitely, memorable and a LV staple. OFF THE STRIP IS THE WAY TO GO!
After discovering that there was a Hofbrauhaus in Vegas I knew that I had to go! I am a big fan of German food and culture and have been to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany. The Vegas location does an amazing job of staying true to the experience. You eat at large tables, often with others at your table, the staff is dressed in traditional German lederhosen and dirndl, they have enourmous traditional pretzels, and you still get the HUGE liter beers! The food was very good and it was awesome to hear the traditional German band belt out drinking songs as tables chimed in and danced. If you have never experienced the feel of a real German beer hall I would highly suggest visiting the Hofbrauhaus.
Great place for big group of friends to hang out for some beer any great German food. There Munchner Weisswurste was not bad at all I enjoy in very much. The Creamy Bavarian Potato soup was also good. I'll definitely come back but the next time without the hangover ........
As someone who's been a vegetarian for 14 years, I'm very happy that they have vegan/vegetarian options. To top that, the vegetarian dishes are actually really good. I've had them all (albeit there's only 3 options) and they were all very filling and tasty. Also, order the jumbo pretzel as an appetizer, it's a must. The beer is great as well. I'd give it a 5, but sometimes the guy performing is a bit much, and I prefer to not chant along to songs and stand on the table when I'm already engaged in eating my dinner. The main seating area is a bunch of wood picnic benches, and you'll probably sit by strangers, but it's kinda fun, the back garden area is a more quiet/intimate setting, but nice as well.
The reason I'm only giving this place 1 star is because we ordered 1 coke and then the waiter brought another coke we didn't order so we thought we got a free refill, then we looked on the bill and they charged us for the other coke 4.50. 9.00 for 2 cokes, I do not like restaurants that rip you off, I will never go back to this place not a trust worthy place, no way to treat customers by ripping them off.
Fun and a good time, but not much food for your money and it's expensive. I would go back there though. Maybe a once a year trip here, not a regular location. Staff were great, polite, and fast.
PROST!!!  I love this place! I make it a point to always come here every time I am in Vegas. After spending a bunch of time in Munich and going to that one it is awesome to be able to experience the Hofbrahaus here in the states.  The Bier is amazing just like in Munich.  I especially like the Jumbo Complete (great to share) and the sausages are wonderful.  The environment is so much fun and can get pretty crowded.  It is on the more expensive side so know that when you go you'll be spending a bit of money but I always take that into account.  For the most part have pretty good service but at times have been pretty slow.  But since I love the environment I'm usually ok with it.  Can't wait to be back!
Well the beer is awesome and I saw someone getting a whipping with a paddle. Some sort of shot. So that was pretty great.. . Everything else is not so much. The sausage, kraut and dipping sauces for the pretzel weren't good. The pretzel however was pretty special.. . My advice is to get the pretzel and a great beer then move on. It was pretty empty when I was there and the beer garden that is beyond the hall didn't seem to be open and that is sad because it seems like the best place to be.
Had a good time. Food was delicious. Little loud, but enjoyable. Waitress messed my bill up three times, but we worked out in the end.  Fun experience.
Fun.  Like many things in Vegas, this copy of the Munich Hoffbrau Haus has all of the form and none of the substance.  If you're looking for an authentic experience, this only partly fits that bill.  That said, the place is blast and I've always had a good time.
Good but over priced. . . The hofbrauhous beers are delicious but at $8 (0.5L) and $16 (1L) they are bit over priced. I had one of the dinner sausage specials which was really good but a small portion. The wife had a vegetarian schnitzel which she she said was really good and a bigger portion then mine. . . Over all it was a good experience but I would not return when in Vegas again. I wanted to feel like I was in Germany again and I got that feeling.
Having been to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, I can tell you it was very authentic - albeit at 1/3 the size. As others mentioned, thefood is mostly good but nothing to die for. The sausages were the best, but the spaetzle and the pork dishes were good too. The dark beer was tasty also. It's not cheap for what it was, but nonetheless it was a great experience and totally fun!
