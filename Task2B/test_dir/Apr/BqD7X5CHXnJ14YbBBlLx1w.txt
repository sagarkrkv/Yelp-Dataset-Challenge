Everything about this dinner was wonderful. From the colorful decor of the restaurant, to the service and especially the food. We ordered a total of 7 tapas and 2 desserts for the both of us and we left stuffed and extremely pleased. Here is what we ordered: . . Lobster Gazpacho,  a chilled Spanish tomato soup with chunks of lobster meat. It was so refreshing and delicious. I wanted the bowl to never end. One of my favorite dish of the night.  (Rating: 5/5). . Calamari A La Plancha, perfectly cooked calamari drizzled with a lemon parsley extra virgin olive oil. The addition of  sweet caramelized onions was a nice balance. (Rating: 4/5). . Next, we had the Porto belly, a cute play on words. It was one huge portobello mushroom topped with generous amount of spinach, bits of bacon and potbelly. A delicious mix of mushrooms and fatty pork. (Rating: 5/5). . Mediterranean Bass, two nice size pieces grilled perfectly moist with a crispy skin drizzled with a Donostiarra sauce and garnished. (Rating: 4/5). . Creamy Risotto was very good, with bits of wild mushroom and melted aged manchego cheese mixed throughout. (4/5). . Yellow tail "teridito" was a smaller size dish, nevertheless fresh. Three pieces of  thinly sliced crudo yellowtail topped with thinly crispy sweet potatoes horseradish cream and ponzu sauce. (Rating: 4/5). . Braised short ribs was to die for, soft, tender and flavorful and came with a size of stringy crispy sweet potatoes and was cooked into a cipolinni glace.  (Rating: 5/5). . We ended the night with dessert. We couldn't decide on one so I got the Molten Chocolate Cake which was warm with chocolate oozing out of the center dusted with a generous portion of powdered sugar. The orange jelly, blood orange sorbet was the perfect cooling contrast to the piping warm dessert.  (Rating: 5/5). . We also had the pistachio tart- almond cake with almond ice cream. This may have been m least favorite dish of the evening given that it tasted like a regular cookie to me, nothing too special. (Rating: 3/5). . Overall, the experience at Julian Serrano was amazing and we will gladly come back next time we're in Vegas.
Food was great. However, Paella needs improvement very wet rice better luck next time. Second time around
Best tapas I've had, hands down. The restaurant is in the middle of the Aria lobby and looks like it's built out of giant sugar sculptures. I liked it! It was very flashy (but appropriate for Vegas).. . The waiter was great at suggesting what to order (Patatas bravas is of note. My boyfriend's father was doubtful; "It's just potatoes, what's the big deal?" It was a big deal). We chatted and took his advice, which turned out to be excellent. Drinks here are also GREAT (pricey, but great)--you can browse it on their very cool iPad app. My boyfriend's mother and I each had one, and we both loved our drinks.. . As for the food...I'm not sure you can go wrong. As mentioned previously, the patatas bravas was great. We had a bunch of meat dishes (the chorizo on a stick was cute and tasty!), but oddly enough, the standout dish was the poached salmon. It had to be the best dish of the night, and probably the best salmon I've ever had. I had to question myself for a second because we were, after all, in the middle of a desert.. . Probably the weakest part of the meal was the desserts. While they were still good (churros in a spicy chocolate sauce that we were practically drinking out of the cup, flan), a round of drinks might have been a nicer ending. At this point, however, I'm grasping at straws.. . Julian Serrano was the best meal we had during our entire stay at Vegas, and we ate at quite a few notable restaurants. It was also (unfortunately for us) the first meal we had after our flight and set the standard for the rest of our stay. I highly recommend!
The risotto is really really good!  If I could have ordered a giant bowl it is the only thing I would have eaten.  That being said the tapas were epic.  We tried the paella for two people and were a little disappointed.
As someone that was born and raised in Spain, my expectations of "Spanish" restaurants tend to be a bit higher than most. . . When you sit down at a place like this, after not being able to taste the food from your country for months, or even years! little key words stand out. And those words make you very excited. For me, the key words were HAM, CABRALES, TORTILLA and PIMIENTO. . The fact that I saw all of these key words on the menu was a good sign. Unfortunately it all went downhill from there.. My fiance and I were hungry and excited to eat some spanish food so we ordered a bunch of different things.. We started off with the Jamon Serrano and Spanish Charcuterie. The Jamon was on top of some tomato garlic sauce. It was about as bland as they come. And I mean bland. They served it on top of some garlic tomato sauce which to me, all it does is mask the flavor of the ham. I was really disappointed. . The Charcuterie was also as bland as the ham. The lomo in that plate had absolutely no flavor. Where are they getting their products from?. . Then we got the cheese platter! another key word, CABRALES! I am from Asturias, that is where Cabrales cheese comes from. And I can say this much. That was NOT it. It is a very stinky, spicy blue cheese and what they served us was a creamy bland mess they called cabrales. . . The tortilla....... sucked. Sorry, it sucked. It was so dry..... I almost finished my whole glass of wine with it. That is NOT how tortilla is supposed to be! For one because it sucks with onions in it. It completely overpowers the flavor of the potatoes and egg. But it was so overcooked..... . I come from a family that makes spanish tortilla on a daily basis. I make it, my mom makes it, my grandma makes it.... and they all turn out glorious. Why is this one so..... meh?. . Onto the next...... the Octopus. It was surprisingly good! Nothing bad to say on this one.. . The Stuffed Piquillo Peppers were delicious. It gave me a few good ideas to make at home since I have them in my fridge. . . and lastly. . The Stuffed Dates. They were very delicious. I don't know how spanish this dish is, because I actually never had it in Spain before, but they were fantastic. . . Overall the restaurant is nice, the atmosphere is trendy and it had a good vibe. I'm sure for someone who isn't used to this type of food, the food will be great. But I did not like it. As a matter of fact, I get upset when the waiter tells me the chef is from Madrid and then they serve me that. Is he really from Madrid? Has he even been there? Does he know what the food looks like there? I'm confused
I love tapas because I don't like decision making and I love having a little bit of everything. This place was good and I was brave (just try it, I told myself), but some things were more up my alley than others. Still, I knew where it wasn't something I liked, it was more about me than the quality of the food or presentation. Like our sushi experience at Kumi at Mandalay, we just asked them to bring out good stuff until we said enough. I would have loved a potato tasty (should have asked about patatas bravas) but they brought out some really tasty things. I don't even like goat cheese, but the Stuffed Dates were probably my favorite, as well as the the little ice cream cone-like tartare, cucumber and guacamole (Tuna Cone); Rabo De Toro (oxtail and mashed potato) was also pretty good. I'd definitely come back here and try out some other fun stuff. This is the type of meal I totally enjoy and Avia was a lot cleaner smelling than the other hotel/casinos anyway.
Just had dinner here and I would say only 3 stars overall . . 1. Patata brava - excellent . 2. Mediterranean chicken skewers -. Chicken was undercooked and pink . 3. Payaya - too sweet . 4. Spanish pizza - toooo oily and the bread seemed like you are eating a butter pastry. . 5. Sangria - awesome . 6. Service - almost felt like I was in a casual cantina whose server wasn't interested in understanding or taking care of the customer. . . Don't know what the hype is about. . . Cascal in mountain view California has much better food, ambience and service. . . Expected better and was disappointed.
Excellent food.  Great value.  We went here multiple times because I wanted to try all the yummy dishes.
Meh...  This meal was nothing to write home about.  Presentation was great, but the food just okay at best.  The value was good, only because we ate at 5:15, so it was happy hour.  I could not possibly recommend paying full price at this place, with so many other outstanding places around.... . The Aria is an outstandingly beautiful place, and the restaurant shares that beauty.  It is a great place to watch people, and the bathrooms are even better...  don't miss them!  You can sit in the restaurant and watch people checking in or walking by in-between the Crystals mall and the Aria casino floor, which provides some of the best people watching on the strip.  You can also enjoy the fantastic display of kites on the ceiling in the Aria lobby.  A great spot to grab a happy hour cocktail for sure...  But, pass on the meal.. . We tried one of everything on the Happy Hour menu, and the only solid dishes were the Spicy Meatballs, and the Raspberry Tuna. All the other dishes were below average in taste.  The Serrano ham plate and Charcutere plate were also enjoyed, but the portions of these full priced dishes were small, and the meat quality mediocre.  The only good part were the toasted bread served with them.  The Calamari was extremely greasy, and did not impress.  The Tomato Bread was soggy and gross.  The Sangria was not good at all either.  Skip it.  Really.. . Beyond the bathrooms, the highlight of the meal was the Carahillo after dinner drink, which is fantastic if you like an ice coffee.  Yum.  Get one.. . I also recommend you pass on dessert...  we had the Flan, and Orange Creme Brulee.  The Flan was more like a fluffy, bubbly omlet, Bad.  And Brulee just okay.. . The service was also poor.  Ordered peppermint schnapps and got peach.  Ordered one decaf coffee and got 4 orders of regular.  Nearly all the dishes came at the same time, so there was not room on the table. Had to do a happy dance to get the attention of the manager, and once he saw the generally unattentive server headed over, he turned around and never visited...  basically, for a high end place like this, lousy service and obviously poor training.. . Really poorly managed place with mediocre food.  Good place for a happy hour drink.  Otherwise, pass.
Excellent meal here for our group of four ladies. The extensive menu drew us to this restaurant. The service and food was excellent. Price was reasonable. Very fast service. We had to be out  within 90 minutes, and we were early. Would definitely go back again.
Recommend ordering only the fish dishes. The white Ceviche and yellow tail was great.  All the beef dishes missed on the savory.  If you do order beef--- ask for a steak knife especially for the short rib. . .  The chicken croquetta was my favorite. The cheese l platter also missed as the goat cheese were were lame. . . Sangria was good, but you should ask them to make sure to put pieces of fruit  from the mix.... It made difference on the second glass. . . Service was great at they let you I'd put 3.5 stars.
It was hard to decide what to get here, the menu was just very expansive, and I was feeling indecisive.  We ended up with 9 small plates in a wide variety of flavors.  I can hardly recall what they are were.  The best dish was a chicken croquette, followed by the braised short ribs.  . . The ambiance could be a bit better, with the dining room located in what is essentially the lobby.  Lots of food creepers walking by, staring down your delicious mini plates.
This restaurant has a pretty low key atmosphere considering the menu. We came here earlier this week for dinner and were lucky to get a table with a view of the TV so we could watch the end of our team's NBA playoff game. It was great that we were able to get amazing food and still catch the game! . . Our server seemed irritated that we were so into the game (a bit pretentious even) but given the casual atmosphere I didn't think it was a problem. . . Dinner was quite delicious- we started with Wagyu Beef Tartare and the Yellowtail Tapas with a half bottle of wine and enjoyed those while we waited for the Seafood Paella (the menu cautions a 40 minute wait, but I think it was less than that).. . All of the food was delicious, but if I were to return I would skip the Paella and stick to tapas. . . All in all, 4 stars - due to the weirdly pretentious service in a casual fine dining establishment.
Excellent service, attentive but not intrusive.  Food pretty good all in all, wide selection of beautifully presented and well made tapas.  My only suggestions to the chef would be maybe spice up the Spanish Charcuterie plate a little, that was pretty boring, and definitely cook the Paella a little longer-the slightly crunchy crust that it should have was sorely lacking and that is the best part.....
YUM!. Who loves tapas!? Doesn't everyone??. We had a wonderful meal and all of the tapas were so tasty! The duck paella was wonderful with super tender duck pieces and tons of artichoke. The desserts were just okay for with the highlight being the spicy chocolate for the churros. The flan was a bit thick and stiff while the rice pudding was a bit thin.. . Great ambiance and the service was spot on. They were always around to refill our glasses or pick up plates.. . kale salad | rainbow baby carrots | heirloom baby tomatoes | red beet gelee | red beet vinaigrette. mixed seafood ceviche | shrimp | white fish | octopus | cilantro | lime juice . seared scallop | romesco sauce . crispy artichoke | crusted artichokes | water cress | olive spread. traditional spanish chicken croquetas | chicken | bechamel . pintxo de chorizos | mini spanish pork chorizo | mashed potato | lemon honey. bomba | veal tenderloin & pork tenderloin spicy meat ball | spicy rocoto sauce. duck paella | duck leg | artichoke | saffron rice. flan creme custard | frutas del bosque  . arroz con leche traditional spanish rice pudding  . churros fried spanish pastries | spicy hot chocolate
My wife and I love Julian Serrano. We try to make it a point to stop in every time we are in La Vegas. When we are there, you will find us enjoying a bottle of Albarino at the bar, where we almost always end up trying a few new dishes in addition to some of our favorites. The ambiance here is a perfect match for our tastes. Oh, and if you sit at the bar and opt for a cocktail instead of wine, ask Premo to make you a Suffering Bastard. I tried one on Saturday. Very nice!
Decided to come here to eat on a late Friday night when we were in Vegas a few weeks ago. Bad idea for my wallet but hey, you're in Vegas and high prices should be expected especially at Aria.  I should have looked at the yelp pictures before coming because I didn't realize the portions would be that tiny. Yes, they are tapas but when each dish is priced at $10-15 dollars, you will need to spend like $80-100 per person in order to feel like you had a real meal. My bf and I ended up ordering the mushroom risotto, salmon and truffle, and the bomba (?) just to try something from each category. . . The food was actually really good. The mushroom risotto was creamy and delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly and I loved the sauce that was drizzled on the plate. The bomba was like a meatball and had a nice spicy kick to it and was delicious as well. . . For an upscale-ish place, service was only so-so. The waitress wasn't very attentive and I think she judged us because we didn't order 10+ dishes like the couple seated next to us. Ambience is nice and trendy but it's really loud in there so don't expect to be able to have a nice conversation in there.
After going to Estiatorio Milos for my first prix fixe lunch, I was determined to find another one at a great price. I found this thread that mentioned Estiatorio Milos and they also said Julian Serrano had an equally delicious menu for only $19. I thought it was too good to be true so I called to confirm since the thread was from last year. They said that they had this special menu from Sunday-Thursday at 11:30am-4pm so I had to get there on Sunday. It was weird because I checked the menu and it didnt mention the $19 so I thought it was a secret menu. When we got there, they gave us a regular lunch menu and I asked for the prix fixe but it was for $49 so I asked about the $19 one. He said it was only for Monday- Thursday but I told him that the person on the phone yesterday said it was for Sunday. He spoke with the manager and checked if they had the ingredients and they were able to provide this menu. I thought it was very nice of them to keep their word. So extra plus for them. The place is in Aria and it is quite festive. They have a bar and the game was playing so that was cool. . . First. 1) Lobster Gazpacho- chilled spinach tomato soup with lobster meat- I didnt see the chilled part so I was quite shocked by the taste of it. I never had purposeful cold soup so it took some getting used to. Not my cup of tea but I am glad I tasted a legit spanish appetizer. . 2) Wild mushroom soup- I preferred this one since it was salty. It was good and I would choose this over the lobster.. . Second. 1) Salmon- It comes with mashed potatoes and I liked that the salmon skin was crispy. I dont know how salmon is a spanish dish so it wasnt anything crazy special but it was good nonetheless.. 2) Rib eye steak- It came with eggplant and french fries and again I dont know how this is spanish but it was good. . . Third. 1) Santiago's cake- LOVEEE this!!! it is a traditional spanish almond cake with turron ice cream and candied almonds. It comes in a nice display and was deliciosss. The cake was tender and the ice cream went perfectly with it. I gobbled that thing right up. This was by far my favorite of the meal.. 2) Flan de turon- almond mcreme custard flan. I am not much of a flan person so I thought it was ok. . . I think Vegas will now be known for prix fixe rather than buffets for me. I am addicted haha. And for so cheap! You cant beat $19 for all this good food. I am surprised that the appetixer and dessert were more traditional than the entrees.. . **TIPS**. 1) The $19 prix fixe is Monday-Thursday, 11:30am-4pm.. 2) The ideal menu is wild mushroom soup, salmon or steak (depends on what you prefer), and Santiago's cake.. 3) Enjoy!
