Just like with other clubs, its free entry with a group of mostly girls. I don't believe I've ever paid cover at a Vegas club, so make sure you get into contact with a promoter. . . Tryst is a smaller, but beautiful venue with a waterfall, awesome DJ's, and a great atmosphere overall. Music was a mixture of hip hop and EDM if I remember correctly. It's not as fancy as newer clubs like XS, but still good nonetheless.
What a beautiful club, Loved the waterfall and the decor. . Great music and the bathroom lighting was flattering :) yes, that's important. . . I think we arrived way to early, the dance floor was quite empty. Quite the sausage fest on a Thursday night. . . Stayed for an hour and a half then ended up leaving. . . I think I'm getting to old for Vegas nightclubs.. . Can someone steer me and my flask to a Piano Bar or Blues club next time?. . RANDOM FACT:. Tryst means an appointed place of meeting.
Got in on the guest list. . Paid $20 for a glass of champagne (god thing I was already on before we got in). . DJ spinned Techno House whatever its called 85% of the time. . They did play about 10% Top 40. . 5% Hip Hop. . Its a little easier to move about in this club than some others I've been to in the past like Haze and Lavo. . Cool Spot but I wouldn't go out of my way
