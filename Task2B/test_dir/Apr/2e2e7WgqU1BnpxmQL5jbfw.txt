Jesus that bread! The way it's toasted is perfection!  I think I had earl'a about 3-4 times last weekend lol. Why? Because it's so damn good!  Worth the wait and truly lives up to the hype
Out of all the places in Vegas and among all the crazy priced eateries, you have this gem that's tucked away in Planet Hollywood.  While it's pretty much in the Miracle Mile Mall it's not really what I would say is "In Planet Hollywood" (probably easier to find if I say it's in the mall).. . I've personally never been to Earl of Sandwich.  While the idea that there was once a mythical Earl of a place called Sandwich is up for debate (and probably debunked) but none the less, I had to try it from all the people that recommended it.. . The best way to describe Earl's is what would happen if you took Arbys, made it good, and then added a selection like Panera Bread.  I didn't really feel adventurous so I just ordered the "Original".  Basically it was roast beef, with horseradish sauce and cheese.. . They make it fresh to order and nice and hot so I was pretty excited.  After taking a couple bites, you start to understand why they're so good.  The roast beef is actually really tender and soft.  It tastes like rare prime rib and not like your deli sliced well done leather consistancy.  Add to that a horseradish sauce that actually has some kick to it and OMG it was amazing.  DEFINITELY recommend the original.  I honestly didn't notice the cheese very much.  The horseradish and the beef were definitely the star players in this game.. . I liked it so much that I went back in the morning.  At under 10 dollars for a sandwich you can't really beat it.  I'd much rather go here than a ridiculously overpriced plate of Ramsey's finest.  I know royalty when I see it, and his name is the Earl of Sandwich.
The tuna melt sandwich is delicious. I love this place!
Delicious and reasonably priced.   Definitely a great place to stop and grab a quick bite.
It's a sandwich.  Nothing too extraordinary.  Sure, it's tasty--and it does satisfy the late night Vegas cravings--but what really sets it apart is the affordability.  In an otherwise expensive, overpriced city (ahem Starbucks, 5.95 for a medium iced coffee?!), Earl of Sandwich is a tiny, well-needed haven of reasonably priced food. . . Tip #1:  Open 24/7!. . Tip #2:  Cheap (~8 dollars for a sandwich). . . Tip #3:  The line can get pretty long at times, but it goes by quickly.  Lots of open seating as well. . . Overall: If you're like me and would rather spend your money in Vegas on other things, this place is for you.
I have ate here a couple times and it's oh so good and nice change of pace in Vegas. Sometimes you get caught up in Vegas with shows and gambling. But eating here gets you back centered and your head back in the game with a great sandwich. Some good choice
delicious hot sandwiches. ingredients are great. Their lemonade is fabulous.
Earl of Sandwich is hands down my new favorite sandwich spot in Vegas. The staff is extremely friendly and the sandwiches are incredible. You have to the Holiday sandwich first and foremost as it reminds me of thanksgiving with turkey, gravy, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. The Hawaiian BBQ is incredible as well and has chicken, ham, cheese, pineapples, and BBQ sauce. There is an amazing selections of sandwiches, salads, wraps, soups, and sides; all of which are made fresh when you order. They also have a phenomenal breakfast menu as well. A must try is the bacon, egg, and cheese on the artesian mini loaf. Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention, Earl of Sandwich also has some of the best cookies in town. If you're looking for a wrap, I recommend the Buffalo Chicken wrap. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy
Wow, what a disappointment! We read all the glowing Yelp reviews and were expecting amazing sandwhiches served at a local institution. After walking through a smokey casino, what we got was very overpriced, salty, small, mediocre salads and sandwhiches. Moreover, the atomoshpere is just one notch above a Subway.. . In a reastaurant mecca like Vegas, there are better lunch options.
Their Avocado BLT is amazing! They definitely do not skimp on the bacon, and the avocado adds a creamy kick to the whole sandwich. The bread is also to die for. Thank god there's one in Downtown Disney, CA. At least I don't have to travel as far to experience this place again. . . Hoping to try their chipotle chicken or holiday turkey sandwich the next time I go!
This is a secret lifesaving gem in Planet Hollywood. Reasonable priced food, sort of fast depending on when you go, in the middle of the Strip.. . Not the best sandwich ever. Not even very good. But it does the trick.. . And it is 24 hours, which comes in handy after a late night in Sin City.
Great place for tourists, but if you are searching for an authentic deli that serves authentic deli style sandwiches, this is not the place. I'm still in search for that sort of deli.
I've only heard of Earl of Sandwich in Las Vegas even though it appears that the company has been around far before I was born, and it recently opened another location right in the center of downtown Disneyland! I only live about 20 minutes from Disneyland, but I would rather have my first taste of an Earl sandwich in Las Vegas, the one that it is known for! . . I wish I was more hungry for a sandwich since Earl is known for that, but I opted to go a little healthy & asked for the berry salad which came with strawberries, blueberries, spinach, chicken, and almond slivers. Those ingredients itself was already calling my name. Maybe because mine was a salad that I did not find it to be that memorable as everyone claims Earl to be. The salad was fresh and the fruits were even better, but it was just quite plain and ordinary for me. My darling had the Full Montagu which had roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce. I took a bite, and it was yummy, but seemed kind of like an ordinary sandwich to me. Hmm.. . I really do want to give Earl another chance, perhaps the one at Disneyland next time, and I will update this review again once I try one of their special sandwiches to myself x
Hubby and I came here for lunch while exploring the strip. I had the mozzarella cheese & tomato sandwich as it was one of the only meat free options available. The sandwich was pretty good, the balsamic vinaigrette added great flavor to the sandwich. This is one of the cheaper places to eat on the strip so if you are traveling on a budget or you work on the strip  this is a good meal possibility.
This is an awesome sandwich shop.  I went to the one in PH on the strip.  The best thing about this place is the potato salad.  The sandwiches were good, but about like Quiznos.  Plus they are really small sandwiches.. . The people working seemed really disinterested in what they were doing and the line moved really really slow.  Can't stand to see service like that, even though they are probably used to a long line all day. . . I would recommend it if you pass by or are staying at PH, but I definitely would not go out of my way to get there...
I wanted something quick to eat between my flight and my dinner plans a few hours away. Decided to go to thins place as soon as I saw it as I've had a good experience with another location at an airport. It did not disappoint, I hate a delicious and HOT sandwich for something like $7
This place was so great! The perfect place for a quick bite to eat and delicious sandwiches! Reasonably priced and a decent size too. The line does get kind of long and out the restaurant but it is totally worth it!
Had breakfast three times here while staying in Vegas. Good food and good value for it.
This sandwich shop is the most overrated place on the strip.  I'd rather go to Erik's delicafe and get an Abbot's Habit than this garbage.  The sandwiches here have more oil than an exxon valdez spill, and they don't have much taste.  I believe that people only like this place because they're cheap.
Im a sandwich fan..  Nothing makes me more happy than a good sandwich and bowl of soup.  Keep you caviar, foiegras, ore even a good steak.  Give me a ruben and some old fashioned chicken noodle and I'm a happy camper.... . Earl of Sandwich fills half of that need.  They make a damn good sandwich.  My personal favorite it their Thanksgiving special with turkey, cranberries (not the band), dressing, and gravy.  Pretty amazing.  All the other sammies are pretty good.  If I'm staying near by ill make the walk.  If im staying more than a few blocks away, not really worth the trip.  . . Pros : Decent sandwich.  Not too expensive. . Cons :. Long lines.. The place gets packed.  Countless times we couldn't find a table once we got our food.
Very good sandwiches and open 24/7 I believe.  Similar to firehouse subs if you have ever been.
I just had lunch - a delicious caprese sandwich! I have had the pleasure of visiting this location in the past - plenty of times, and I mean... plenty! It's definitely a Las Vegas staple for me every time I visit. Usually, I stay at Planet Hollywood, which makes it so easy to enjoy this place more than once, but this visit we're staying at another hotel. I still made the time to visit!. Anyway, you order with the first register. You pick up snacks and sides and beverages along the way to the second register where you pay. The potato salad is sooo good, and I'm picky about potato salad! The brownies are a good dessert, too! For two sandwiches, it comes out to $14.03 (with tax), which isn't terrible... because they are quite filling! Overall, another excellent visit to my favorite sandwich place!
This is one of my go-to spots when I'm in Vegas.... all the sandwiches and salads I've had were SO GOOD! I would even wait in the inevitable long line because their food is delicious... especially when you spend all day all night winning the strip with your yard long haha YOU MUST EAT HERE!
If you are on the strip, looking for a filling meal that won't cost all your gambling winnings, this is it! The sandwich alone was large enough to fill me up, but there are a variety of deli sides available, if you so choose! It sounds like any sandwich choice is a good choice, but my stamp of approval is on The Earls Club!
Good sandwiches, late night quickie for food and not really a long wait. There's a quick turnaround to their dining tables and the lines to order move quick. . . I love Earl's sandwiches. They have a lot of sandwiches but I've only been to Earl's in Vegas a handful of times. I liked their holiday turkey sandwich (turkey, stuffing, cranberry jam, etc). . . Planning on hitting up the Earl of Sandwich in Downtown Disney soon.
Great food. Everytime my wife and I go to Vegas we have to eat here at least twice I love the turkey stuffing and gravy sandwich.
Great bacon chicken avo wrap, tomato soup and chocolate chip cookie! My boyfriend got the bacon Mac & cheese and I tried it and it was SO good!
Decided to visit after I read the reviews on Yelp.  The line situation is strange.  First, there is an interrogator at the beginning of the line that attempts to discover which type of sandwich you are getting.  He then gives you a receipt for that sandwich, and proceeds to tell you that the drink and chips can be ordered at the end of the line.  So...this guy's purpose in life at this restaurant is to determine which sandwich you want?  Ok....fine.  I will play along.. . I ordered the Reuben.  He printed out my receipt.  I paid for the sandwich, my fiance's sandwich, a bag of chips, and two drinks at the end of the line.  They then gave me these nifty lighted thingys that will inform me when my sandwich is completed and ready for pickup.  Ok...organized....good.. . To my surprise the lighted up thing went off about 5 minutes into the wait.  I thought "cool...I get my sandwich before these other people that were way ahead of me in line...it must be because of my total rewards tier credit...they are treating me right!"  . . WRONG.  First, EOS told me they do not take part in the Total Rewards, which sucks, and the reason they turned on the lighted thing was to tell me they had no Pastrami.  . . So....let me get this straight.  You have a guy whose sole job is to determine your sandwich order...that's his job...sandwich ordering...knowing what is present in the restaurant and what is needed etc.....and he screwed it up?  How does a sandwich restaurant not have Pastrami?  That would be like Santa with no reigndeer, Books with no learnin', staying home sick and not watching Price is Right.  The first layer of defense in telling me a worldwide pastrami shortage threatened Vegas failed with the sandwich receipt guy and the second layer of defense failed with the final cashier ringing me up for a sandwich that did not exist at that restaurant at that time.. . Technology just rolled over in its grave...
Very rarely am I impressed by sandwiches. What? It's two slabs of bread with some meat stuffed between them, blegh. I could make it myself at home, for the low low price of free ninety nine. With the exception of a handful of places, for the most part, I avoid ordering sandwiches when dining out. . . Earl of Sandwich, is one of these exceptions. After eating nothing but buffets for the weekend, I desperately needed a change in the food scenery. Although I'm not super fond of sandwiches, the boyfriend and the bestie are so we stopped here for lunch on our last day in Vegas. . . Talk about a sensory overload. There are so many options to choose from--sandwiches, soups, and salads. But heellloooo, I'm here for the sandwiches! Okay, I lied, I also got a salad too--but more on that later. Although I wanted everything, because they ALL sounded that good, I ended up getting the Full Montagu because it has a little bit of everything, turkey, roast beef, swiss and cheddar? Yes, yes, yes and yes! The bread is perfectly toasted, and the meat is thinly sliced and amazingly tender. The melted cheeses not only added flavor but helped to keep the sandwich moist. Plus, I love mustard on anything, so yes again! At first glance, I found the sandwiches to be on the small side, but in hindsight, it was perfect! . . So in addition to the sandwich, I alsoended up getting the Baja Chicken salad. Loved the packaging and the avocado, but this was just okaaaayyy, there was nothing special about it, and I probably wouldn't order it again. If you're thinking of add-on's for the meal though, I'd definitely do the brownie sandwich if you have a bit of a sweet tooth! . . If you're on the strip, Earl of Sandwich is definitely a must do! It's a great change of pace if you're sick of overeating at the buffets. Portions are reasonably sized, and prices aren't bad either. Your waistline will breathe a sigh of relief, and your wallet will thank you also!. . Lesson learned though, don't order the salad at a sandwich joint. Always, always, go for the sandwich!
Hands down the best Pastrami Rueben I have ever sinked my teeth into!. . I'm salivating over here thinking about my Rueben.. . You can't beat having lunch under $8. . Oh Earl you well always have my heart. . . RANDOM FACT: . The first Earl of Sandwich franchise opened in Sugar Land, Texas
this sandwich place has the most freshest and vibrant lettuce in a sandwich ive ever seen! open 24 hrs too. the sandwiches here are nothing short of spectacular. my husband and i loved it so much we came here for lunch and again at 3 am after drinking to take food back to our hotel. this is definitely a must stop place to have a great hot sandwich
I love that they are24 hours and budget friendly. Especially after a long vegas night, you want something warm and wholesome to make you feel better and get right back in the action! . . They also have a full blown bake shop, to satisfy anyone's sweet tooth. Great variety of gourmet muffins, cookies (jumbo sized or cookie bites), brownies or for the healthier option fruit parfaits. . . Here's what we ordered: . (You can add a side of soup (which is my favorite), or you can add chips, potato salad, pasta salad, coleslaw, for a small additional price.). . Caprese - this sandwich is super simple yet crazy packed with flavor and freshness! It's your classic caprese on a toasted sandwich. They really loaded the sandwich with a fair amount of thick juicy slices of mozzarella and basil. They also topped it with a scrumptious dreamy balsamic glaze. It was definitely love at first bite. This sandwich also went very well with the creamy tomato soup. 5/5. . The Original 1762 -  This is the bare basic. It's moist roasted beef, melted cheddar, and some horseradish sauce. It was simple, but the roast beef was cooked well and super moist and flavorful. Not too much cheddar and not too much horseradish sauce flavor. It was easy to eat, especially if you knocked one too many down and need some help sobering up. 4/5. . Creamy tomato soup - it's definitely creamy, thick and very comforting. It has a great tomato cream flavor and I especially loved the freshly fried super crispy croutons. They were so good! I should of asked for extra! This soup is definitely one of my favorites and they always pair well with most of the sandwiches. 5/5. . Hawaiian bbq - ehhh I didn't like this sandwich. It had a big piece of chicken breast with bbq sauce and also 2 slices of canned pineapple rings, (well they advertise fresh pineapple, but it tasted canned to us...) Also the way it's cut into rings on the sandwich made it messy and the insides moved around and made it awkward when I bit the sandwich. The flavor was off too. It just tasted like canned pineapple and nothing special. Great concept, but poorly executed and not so tasty flavor. I would not recommend this one. 1/5. . Brownie - $2.29 A classic brownie that was moist, fluffy and tasted good. I took two bites but saved the rest for later. It's pretty big! 5/5
The sandwich shop located near the entrance of PH is a good place to get a bite. Sandwiches taste good and made on spot. Excellent serving size and quality on the soups. Expect a huge line and 30 minute wait. The coffees taste very plain and run down. It's kept warm only and it's self served. I would go next door for Starbucks anytime. There is free wifi which is good to checkup on things while relaxing and eating your sandwich.
Fast food sandwiches. Ok but they aren't clued up on ingredients when I asked them about the mozzarella if it was veggie? (Some traditional mozzarella has rennet in it). They can churn out a quick sandwich if you are on the go and want a quick bite to eat, the wrapping is clever with metallic foil outer wrap and grease proof inner to stop it going soggy. . . They issue a pager so you can get a table and collect your food when it's ready. . . Ok but not brilliant. Can't understand why you would queue to get in here? . . I think the name has people intrigued.
So you want a delicious sandwich on the strip, but don't want to spend all your gambling and drinking money?  Look no further than the E.O.S.!  This place has a great menu of quality sandwiches, freshly made to order, fast, and for under $9.  Even in the middle of a feeding rush, they had our meal ready to eat in under 5 minutes.  As for seating, it didn't look that big, but we had no trouble getting a table.  They are open 24 hours now too so time of day is never a factor.  I stopped short of "going all in" and slapping down a 5 star because of one thing.  The soda fountain prices are crazy!  Hell $3 for a regular cup?  If it even matters they have Pepsi products, ice tea, and coffee.  Overall this place is a jackpot on the strip for fast, tasty sandwiches at any time of the day.
Best 24hr sandwich shop in Vegas. Simple caesar  salad wrap was delicious and the Mac and cheese was very good. Hubby had a pastrami sandwich which appeared small (we are from Texas where portions are huge) but it was surprisingly filling for him. Very good place highly recommend.
This is one of the top places to grab a sandwich. I don't even really like ham but there ham sandwich is bomb.  The only sandwich I wasn't a fan of was the one with the stuffing and cranberries and thats probably because I don't like those things anyway.  But I still tried it and it wasn't terrible just not for me. Everything else hear you can't go wrong.
Going to Earl's is now on our must-do list every time we go to Vegas. Great sandwiches and they are open 24 hours. I order their caprese the most and it never disappoints. . . We stayed at Planet Hollywood this most recent trip and ended up going to Earl's 5 times. . . The only thing missing is the feeling that you are not being rushed through an assembly line. Yes, they are busy but having someone taking orders and the payment that can give you that welcome smile and show some appreciation you are there goes far in my book.
