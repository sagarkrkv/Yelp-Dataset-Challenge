I love this buffet. The Macaroons are so yummy!!!
The appearance outside of the buffet seems to be lacking of business and happiness. But the line was short and mom and I were hungry anyway. Price for lunch is $25. If you are a lover of crepes which they also sell outside, I prefer you to come here. As for the food, kinda shitty. They basically had veggies cooked in three ways in each section. Also serving mashed potatoes, overly heavy pasta, turkey and prime rib which I didn't have. Horrible selection of sushi and fruit. Sushi rolls seemed like raw white urchins. Fruit was in a dressing pot which only had melon, pineapple, and melon. So you get my point. Dessert was basically cookies, brownies, "cakes", just like at any other $10 buffet. Later they started serving macaroons. Personally, I don't like them and trying one made me want to spit the calories back out. So please, if you come here.... Eat two or three crepes and it will be worth it. (Custom or the flavors are on the wall)
Make a reservation and save room for creeps. A wonderful eatery that is very much worth the trip. Keep an eye out for a good groupon to save yourself some money.
Great buffet for a good price! At breakfast, they have both an omelette and a crepe station. Their selection of food is very nice, at a better price than most of the other buffets on the strip. The line isn't too long, and stays the same during breakfast to dinner.
We tried the buffet at Le Village in Paris Paris on a friday night. We were smart to get the Groupon that came out recently so it was a good deal. I did see almost all the people pay retail $$$. The line was crazy, we waited almost an hour. . Firstly, I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. I get that the ambience of the place was nice, but apart from that I wasn't impressed. The French ambience does make the experience a little nicer, as the buffet is organized by food from different provinces in France. That was the only interesting part , the food and service were really average.. . Food - I wasn't impressed by the variety, It contained only French varieties, and no delicacies. In Vegas, one does walk in expecting some level of opulence, delicacies and surprises, especially if I am paying $40pp, which were missing. Of course, since it was only French menu, the few dishes they had were well prepared. However, as a vegetarian, there was barely anything tasty to eat. The made to order crepes were the saviors. Although, they were very nice, delicate and well prepared, I have had better crepes in food trucks in Austin. Apart from that, all there was, were 4 different kinds of potatoes to eat! Really, after All the hype about French cooking, I was expecting some nicely prepared vegetarian options. Even the bread collection was so mundane, you can find those in your local cafeteria. . The macaroons were the highlight of the dessert section, but again, what if they're flour less and delicate? A cookie is still just a cookie, bake me a nice cake! No cheesecakes, no tortes, no ice cream.. The seafood collection seemed ton be nice and people were enjoying the crab legs. There was a decent grilled chicken in a so called Mediterranean section, but nothing else looked interesting. I saw shrimp, clams but nothing seemed grilled or spiced. Probably the worst hummus I've had was here. Even the usual suspects, like pizza, Mac n cheese which are kid friendly were missing or scarce.. . The drinks and Service - we had the bottle of wine with our package, but didn't feel like having it then. The server said, their policy was that they had to open it! Bummer. We got the red wine and it was a nice balanced Cabernet. There were other drinks like ice teas, sodas, mimosas,beers etc. The server didn't return for the remainder of our dinner and never asked to refill our drinks or bring any other. They have waitresses dressing up in old French maid costumes but they are really old and cannot keep up with the tables. There were so many empty tables, but they couldn't get them cleaned in time to get guests seated.. . I'd say, forget the French hype and go for a more traditional buffet next door at pH.
The line was out of control and the food wasn't it worth it! I went for dinner but it was very disappointed and if you don't like creeps the dessert section is disappointing! Go to the restaurant next door in the Paris.... Way better!
I purchased a Groupon deal for lunch and for $35.99 you get lunch for two and a bottle of wine. The highlights of the meal were the pasta dishes and the meats from the carving station. They had potatoes prepared in every way possible and a Mediterranean section randomly hidden at one corner. I was surprised that the dessert selection wasn't as extensive as I thought it was going to be. Definitely check out the crepe station because they'll substitute ingredients for you if you ask nicely.
Having come here two or three times in the past, I believe that this buffet changed. I don't actually remember that far back ro determine whether or not it's a good change or bad... I think  I'll make my final decision at the end of this review.. . I guess I'll start off with what I liked- MACARONS. Similiar to many teenagers/pre-teen/adolesents (whatever the hell I am), I like to go with whatever is "in" right now. At the moment, I believe that these pricey little pastries ranging from $1.50 to $3.50 are the hype of hype. I guess it's because of how expensive it is. Anyways, there were macarons here. I think I ate 4 or 5. I understand that there are now macarons in almost every Vegas buffet, but I do believe it wasn't here before. The last time I went, there were very few pastries that I think I enjoyed. (Actually, I don't think I was a French-obbessed person then, so it might have been there and I haven't noticed.). . Well, in that case, I think I just wasted a whole paragraph. Because as I'm strolling through the buffet (Yes, I'm too full to be sitting down so I'm walking instead), I can't name one extraordinary thing about this place. Everything was rather medicore- nothing I wouldn't find at my hometown. . . Most of their meat dishes were too salty. Their baguettes were sort of stale. (Okay, I'm Vietnamese so I'm used to crunchy French bread). The majority of the dishes were the same with just the sauce altered. Their macarons were actually tasting a bit stale-chewy (I don't know if any of you know what I'm talking about) after the 3rd one or so. Their crepes aren't all that good. I had "La poulet" (Um... isn't the word for chicken masculine?) . The chicken honestly looked like smashed little rocks or something. It wasn't really favorful or anything. I guess I should've tried a sweet crepe. Another thing I'd like to point out is that the desserts section composes of around 4-5 dishes. There are many different plates, but each plate contains the same thing. When I was there, it was some mushy cheesecake and chocolate mousse. There WERE chocolate chip cookies (French, right?) but even that got switched out. Now everything's peanut butter cookies. The labels for about 30% of the dishes were wrong. I think 90% of the mislabeled foods were in the desserts section, though. . . I'm not a big fan of seafood, but their crab legs appear pretty fresh. In fact, the chefs cook the pasta and other dishes right in front of you. Other sections (ahem- desserts), seem to have stacks and stacks of premade, stale food.. . Overall, the scenery and overall environment were pretty good. I apologize for my inconsistant opinion. There are few good things and there are a few bad things. . . One of the last things I'd like to mention is that some of the French is incorrect. I suppose the creators just wanted to put conjugates so Americans could understand it better. Although I might be wrong on my part. I'll have to ask my teacher for confirmation. It's not a big part of my review, and this isn't affecting my rating.. . EDIT: After going to the Bacchanal buffet, I have to add another star for its price. So much cheaper than that one. I don't care if that buffet had more options- it wasn't worth it.
What happened to this buffet? It started with the cashier when we paid for dinner. The cashier had no sign of any enthusiasm. As if she was ready to go home at 4 pm. Then the host who was in charge to give us a table even lacked more customer service. She was on the phone talking to her family- I'm like really? Aren't you on the clock? As if she was on her break. The server who helped us was nice and very attentive. She knew when to ask us for beverage, water or coffee.  Let's talk about the crepe station. That guy looked like he did not want to be there to begin with. The cold section where the seafood was, smelled like nasty sewer. They did not fill what was out, and the floor on that station looked like as if you were in the wet market.. . I would like to compliment the guys who worked in the steak section. They were very kind and friendly. They had all the enthusiasm in the world that 65 % of the crew did not have. The prime rib is BOMB! It goes well with that french gravy! I think i's called Burgundy sauce. Top it off with mushroom and side of the rice pilaf (the one with butter) and woaaallah! Dinner is served! You have to try the macaroni and cheese- another bomb.com! There were 2 types of rice pilaf, and both were yummy! And last but not the least; the dessert. Creme Bulee, Flan and etc. There were lots of delicious treats to go for. Don't forget the crepe. You can add stuff to your crepe right on your own table like, the flan and some chocolate from the dessert station. . . I have to say I really like this buffet but, change is definitely a must! The atmosphere with the workers looked like there were tension among the diversity of the race. As if they were not happy to work there. They did not want to work together as a team and just wanted to mind their own business. The guys in the steak section- they need to take a page from their book. They knew what great customer service was, and they looked like they enjoy what they do. If not for the tension among the staff, the dirty seafood section and the cashier & host  who lacked professionalism- I would have rated this buffet a 4 or even 5. A lot of delicious stuff in the variety for a fair price.
Reading the mixed reviews for some of the buffet items, I concentrated my calories on the famous crepes.  There is a line for the crepe station, but it went pretty quickly.  I waited maybe 15 minutes, and it was well worth it.. . I ordered a savory crepe with mushrooms, spinach, and parmesan and a sweet crepe with Nutella and bananas.  Then pretending I was a food artist I paired the savory crepe with salad and smoked salmon.  I then got some fresh strawberries to accompany my sweet crepe.  Both crepes were delicious!. . Since we were here a little before 11 a.m. (the latest time for breakfast prices), they also started to change the breakfast dishes out for lunch items.  The only lunch items I tried were the sushi and seaweed salad.  Both were pretty good, but nothing special.  . . If you're in the mood for all-you-can-eat crepes, Le Village is a winner!  The ambiance will also make you feel like you are dining in a charming Parisian courtyard.
Well, my prior experience was good, but I am not sure what had happened to this place.  I personally picked this place from my own experience from few years back and this time, I took a large group of my co workers on Friday night.   I should have known the quality, when I saw very small lines formed, when it is normally, should be a busy hour.  Like a previous reviewer on the YELP, the cashiers were not happy to be there.  Kind of like, " Okay, who is next"  kinda of vibe from one of them. (there are two cashiers).  Foods were just okay, but Prime Rib was so dried that it was close to a Beef Jerky level.   Most of the foods were kind of mediocre, few thing that stand out were.  Crapes and Macaroons  other than that, I am not sure I will pay $32 to have this food again.   Will I revisit this place again.  Well, Probably not anytime soon.  I would pay extra and go some other places.
Best buffet in Vegas! Only issue I had was with the line being sooooo long. It's was also a little pricey! You would expect with the amount of money they bring in that their buffet would be a little cheaper. But then again they have the Best quality food any any buffet I've eaten at in Vegas!
At least it's consistent. With... the quality of service at Paris.  I was there right after they opened.  They really didn't care then and they still don't.   The buffet is nothing to write home about.  $31/person.  Had better.  If you're in a crunch for time as we were, no line ( clue!)  It was 5:30p.m. it's a place to get a meal fast.  Crepes were good...wish they hires someone who actually had experience= slow
We came for breakfast as part of our gluttony experience (buffet of buffets).  Theyoung man at the crepe station was friendly and fast.  He was awesome.  I tried the ham and cheese. Ecellent. The pastries were OK.  The slab bacon and kielbasa was very good. After eating at bacchanal the night before, I didn't have a huge appetite. I would eat here again.  It is muuuch better than spice market buffet. We arrived at 7:15 am.  No waiting.  Small seating area.  I could see how there would be a long wait to get in.
I went there for the lunch buffet this time. There were some good options at this buffet. The seaweed salad was tasty, but the sushi was lackluster. They didn't have any chopsticks, either, which is odd for serving that kind of food. The cheddar cheese was very good, and the havarti was decent. The beef tips were tender and juicy, a good choice. The pork belly with apples was also a win. I was very happy to find a variety of vegetables because I bought the Buffet of Buffets pass, so this was the third buffet I had been to in that time period, and the vegetable options had seemed to be limited at some of the other buffets. The brussel sprouts were tender and buttery, but not overcooked. The asparagus, carrots and broccoli were equally as delicious, as were the fingerling potatoes. With the desserts, my absolute favorite was the raspberry topped cheesecake. It was the perfect balance of light creaminess with the fruity topping adding sweetness to the savory. Their chocolate cake was also tasty. They have a good variety of sugar free options, too, but I didn't get any.. . The staff in there are friendly enough, but some of them aren't worried about helping someone not in their section. They'd rather hurry right by you and not stop and take a moment to see what you need. I had breakfast here last year and got a crepe, which I enjoyed. I thought they had a good breakfast buffet, and I liked it better than the lunch. I don't know what I'd expect from the dinner buffet from them, though.  It's worth a go with the Buffet of Buffets pass, but I don't know if I'd purchase a way in on its own.
I expected more from Paris hotel to be honest. Some of the meat was dry, staff was pretty unorganized and most of the time unhelpful and not friendly. Food variety was pretty limited as well. The only highlight were the macaroons at the desert station which were out of this word!
dinner in Paris... -sigh- maybe one day the real thing. . Dined here for the first time and all went well.  Came here for dinner and food was great. We love meat and there was no shortage of it here. Plenty to choose from including roast prime rib, lamb, turkey and pork brisket. As far as seafood choices we had ice cold crab legs and they were already cracked open, actually, they were sliced in half to expose the crab meat. I had the salmon and it was tasty and delicious. Also tried the sauteed mushrooms... yummy! For dessert, there were choices of tiramisu, creme brulee, creme caramel... oh, yes, I tried them all! Originally priced at $30.99/ea with their rewards card. We used our dining voucher from our timeshare resort gifted to us. Lighting was dim and the atmosphere was themed as if dining outdoors in a village (hence, the name of this buffet restaurant). The servers were dressed as village locals. Had great dining experience here.
Nasty, just nasty! I went with a group of friends who insisted on going. They had earlyer attended breakfast. I stuck with steamed veggies and some smoked salmon after sampling some versions of a french buffet. Meats were dried out or over cooked. The desserts were ok for buffet style dinning, in which I enjoyed the mini fruit tarts what made that an even worst experience was the fish flavored coffee. This french buffet is a suggestion of what french cusiene really is. Ohh if you want wantabbes that think they are french because your at a "french buffet" or want to travel to europe and the closest is the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas you will get that vibe. This place is a joke!!!
50 minutes waiting just to be seated. No plates. After asking for a high chair four times we just went and found one. . . Restrooms are... No words to describe. . . Is there any management running this place?. . Food is ok. Service is. Well there is no service.
Funny buffet X3 reasons... . #1...the ambiance and seating is pretty dismal. I felt like I was sitting in a high school cafeteria fold out chair in the gym that had been decorated by the French Club in Paris theme for a school dance...  . #2 Funny, the food looks like its going to be what you expect from an unfortunate buffet experience, dry and under seasoned, but when you sit back down and dig in, it ALL tasted really good. Now I didn't eat every single dish... But the salmon wasn't over cooked, the beef was tender and seasoned well, the chicken was tasty. The desserts were a lot of French fun.Wine comes with your meal, that's nice.... #3 Funny... We made reservations and sat down immediately, nice. There was a line disney style curved in a little dark awful "lobby" area. Went on forever. There were at least 8-10 tables empty around us throughout our meal. Why? Generating hype with the line? It ain't a club!. Go for the food, with a reservation and you'll be okay. . But really, go to Wicked Spoon.
The buffet wasn't bad. The highlight of the meal was the bottle of wine we got, mussels, clams and the crepes. . . The servers were friendly, though not timely. We would wait at least 10 min to get refills on any drinks or even to get our plates cleared but when anyone showed up they were very nice. . . I loved loved the selection of cheese. They were pretty much everywhere but some areas I wish there was something to eat w the cheese. Perhaps I am used to eating cheese with crackers or even a selection of cold cut meats would help. . . The desserts that were present were yummy and I have no complaints. . . The thing that frustrated me the most was out table was uneven. It kept wobbling and literally I'm surprised no cups fell to the ground. . I would recommend this place to go eat but keep in mind it's mostly French inspired foods.
Hands down the best buffet for breakfast in all of Las Vegas!  If the amazing crepes don't put you into a state of nirvana, I don't know what will.  We come here every time we are in town.
After a few days in Vegas, my boyfriend was dying to head to a buffet and we thought breakfast would be a good one. We read mixed reviews on so many across town and decided to just give Le Village Buffet a try. It is located in Paris, pretty easy to find near the shops. We waited in line between 10-15 minutes not due to limited seating due to the cashier and waiting to be seated.. Once seated, our ordered for coffee and orange juice was taken and we headed to the food. There were no lines at any station, a few people at crepes and that was it. We got in around 10:30 which was perfect as they are starting to finish up breakfast service and switch to lunch, therefore the are putting out their last fresh trays of food. From eggs benedict to pastries we had plenty off options. The bacon was decent, egss bene good, pancakes yum. Turkey bacon, chicken sausage not so hot. Hash was great but scrambled eggs too wet. Pastries tasted like they came from Costco nothing special there. Should have started with a crepe to sample what they are known for but my stomach was growling.. For the price $20 per person and the wait time I was pleased. Not over the moon, I mean it is a buffet but I would go again as it was an overall good experience.
Pricey for all you can eat buffet, as each individual was 20$. There were many different types of options, ranging from eggs, sausages, bakery items, made to order crepes, and fruit. I ordered the #2 sweet crepe, which was too filled with berries. They also scooped some whipped cream on top of the crepe, which made it perfect. Our waitress was marvelous and was very attentive to our needs.
The signature treats in this buffet are the crepes and the macaroons. Crepes are prepared to order with the ingredients you choose from their selection. They are topped with jam, whipped cream and powdered sugar. Extremely delicious!. . The presentation and set up need a little bit of work, though. Not all the stations are maintained cleaned.. . Read my extended review in my blog: http://lagamio.com/2014/04/29/le-village-vs-the-buffet/
Bought lunch groupon with a free bottle of wine. Was very disappointed. Food was OK, not too many option. The wine was the worst wine I've ever had. We threw ours away, I notice others didn't drink it either.
Saving grace was the crepes. Meat was tough,  rubbery and somewhat flavorless, cake was dry.. . Crepes were awesome though. They saved the rating.
