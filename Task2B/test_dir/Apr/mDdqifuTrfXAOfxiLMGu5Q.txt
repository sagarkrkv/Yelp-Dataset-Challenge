First let me say that I am a big Gordon Ramsay fan.  My wife and I went to his steakhouse and expected the high standards that he demands from Restaurant Nightmares.  What we got was a nightmare.  We were seated over 30 minutes late for our reservation.  They have about 6 scantily clad young girls to do one hostess job (not necessarily a bad thing if you are a man).  The bar area is cramped and depressing and not a place you want to eat or have a drink.  The wine list offers few options unless you want to order a $300 overpriced generic bottle or drop a mortgage payment on a bottle of Petrus.  The mashed potatoes were like potato soup and the steak was not all that great given the Texas Chainsaw Massacre like production in choosing your dead flesh.  What really bothered us was the service.  We sat for 20 minutes while our server, another server, and the manager all walked past us with our finished entree plates.  Split a fish and chips at his pub across the street. It is the best fish and chips I have ever had, is a great value to share, and you won't leave there thinking his high standards on his shows are a bunch of bs.
My bf and I came here last night 3/31 and it was AMAZING! He had the lobster wellington and I had the beef wellington. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese and brussel sprouts which were equally as amazing as the wellingtons! . . It is a little bit loud in there, but I get that they're trying to stay with the hip Vegas theme. Waiters are very attentive. It was bf and I's 3 year anniversary so the waiters all said happy anniversary to us which was very sweet! . . Also, I had made reservations for the wrong date(was supposed to be for 4/1) but we were able to get a table and only waited about 15-20 min which was great! . . We will definitely be coming back here again on our next trip to Vegas!
Steak provides a great dining experience on the Strip in Las Vegas. Although the ambient noise can intrude a bit on intimate conversation, the main reason to come here is for the food. The various cuts were all presented and explained by the knowledgeable staff before we placed our order. The appetizer we ordered, English Chowder, was superb. The bone-in rib-eye was tender and succulent. The brussels sprouts were excellent, too. Brussels sprouts?? Yep!! And be sure to save room for the sticky toffee pudding dessert. Damn!! It's good!! Next time we are in Vegas, we're hitting this place up again!!
I've always said the only thing Vegas is good for is good shows, losing money, and fine dinning. This steak house obviously fits into the last category. Last time I was in Vegas I had the tasting menu at nobu, this time I am having the steak at Gordon Ramsay. I was going to give it 4 stars, but after some thought I feel it should be 5. The average price should be about ~$100 per person if you steer clear of the caviar. I don't feel like the tasting menu was worth it because I'm not a huge fan of beet salads. The HK antioxidant drink was good and worth it, and do not leave WITHOUT having the toffee dessert!
I was so disappointed in this place... Service was terrible - the waiter couldn't be bothered and was rude... Took 20 minutes just to get a drink and we had to ask for menus! Food was ok! I expect much more from a Gordon Ramsey establishment!
Here at the Las Vegas Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant for my birthday, with wife, her son and his wife. We were seated upstairs, in a very nice booth, and were attended to very well.  For such a large, and busy restaurant, the noise level was reasonable.  Incredible wine list, helpfully shown on a tablet computer.  I will say though, it took me awhile to sort through the listings; the menu structure was not very user friendly!  Three of us had the beef wellington and one rib eye.  It took the advertised 45 minutes, but they went fast as we enjoyed our wine.  No complaints from anyone, the food was excellent and well served as it should be at this price level!  Side dishes included the mac and cheese and caesar salads, each equally good. For me the portions were just fine, but I am at a point in life now where I frequently share entrees.  Still, we brought some back to our hotel!  Given the choices in this city, not sure I would come back.  Expected just a bit more!
Hands down the best meal I have ever eaten! We had a great 4 course meal with steaks, beef Wellington, and a dessert to die for! The service was 5 star and the staff was outstanding including accommodating us with our 6 month old son!! Never been treated better! Would fly back just to eat there!
We ate here last spring. I told the wife if everything was not perfect we were doing a Hell's Kitchen move and sending it back. Well.... nothing went back and Ramsey exceeded our expectations.....especially the sticky toffee pudding!
My wife and I had dinner at Gordon Ramsey Steak on April 4, 2014, during a spring break Las Vegas trip.. . I have so say that I had very high expectations, and they were not disappointed. As other reviewers have stated, the music seemed a bit loud at first (British Rock and Roll) but as I sat down, relaxed, and had some wine I found that I was enjoying the atmosphere. . . The wine list was extensive with options that ranged from reasonable inexpensive ($45-55) to four and five figures. After we decided our appetizer, entrees, and sides we decided on a Sangiovese that was priced at $55 a bottle that was very nice, and pared well with the food. . . The selection of breads was excellent. It included: Lemon Focaccia with Olive Oil, Black Truffle Mushroom with Pancetta and pork fat, Baguette with Blue Cheese and Blue Cheese and Walnut served with butter with sea salt. The Black Truffle Mushroom with Pancetta and pork fat was particularly flavorful, needing no help from the butter. My wife and I committed to having only one bread plate; but, after tasting the selection, we could not say "no" when offered a second. . . Our appetizer choice was the chorizo stuffed lobster tail with kale and lentils. The lobster was sweet and full of flavor, and the chorizo balanced the dish nicely. My wife is not a huge fan of either cooked greens or legumes; but even she enjoyed the flavor of the lentils and kale. . . Foe steaks, my wife chose the prime filet, and I chose the prime bone in ribeye. Both steaks were prepared perfectly at a medium-rare temperature. The sear was great; and the crust on the outside was amazing. For me, this was at least a tie for the best steak I have ever had. . . For sides we selected the mac and cheese with fresh peas, and tempura hericoverts. I learned during this meal that we have been doing mac and cheese all wrong, and that blue cheese is a critical component to the dish. This mac and cheese was easily the best I have ever had.. . Jon, the third place finisher from last season's Hell's Kitchen has been hired on, and was expediting.. . The desert menu looked excellent; but we were far to full to order anything. . . The service was flawless. Any time our wine or water glasses were getting near low, there was someone to come and refill. The servers were knowledgeable and attentive; while giving us plenty of space to enjoy the meal. . . In summery, I would change nothing from this meal except, perhaps, turning the volume down on the music just a little.
Amazing!  Everything from the service, to the food, to the decor was great. I went with my boyfriend...he has been there before but I had not. They gave me a short tour letting me know why the restaurant looked the way it did (I won't give it away but the story behind it is cute) The wait staff shows you all the different cuts of steak...that made my decision harder!  All of the food was delicious.  We had steak, lobster tail, and my boyfriend had foie gras.  We enjoyed every last bit, but we're too stuffed to try out the desserts!  If you're in Vegas, make a reservation to go there. Sometimes, you may even have a chef from Hell's Kitchen cooking for you!
The experience was simply amazing; the restaurant absolutely out does itself.  The minute we walked in the door the hostess explained the way the restaurant was designed. The staff was extremely attentive and made the overall experience amazing from assisting us with dinner, choosing the wine, appetizers, the main course, and dessert.  I would withouta doubt return and make reservations at other Gordon Ramsay restaurants.
I was not impressed.  The steak was mediocre at best and the service was good until the waiter found out that we weren't drinking wine or cocktails. . . There were positives though...The pork belly appetizer was outstanding as well as the baked potato. . . Overall I would not return
Music way too loud...like sitting in a bar waiting to dance   Boom.  Boom.  Boom. Food was great but if you want to talk to your partner go somewhere else.
Me and my husband is a fan of Gordon Ramsay, we've ate here twice ..most recently last Sunday. Since, we always come here with our 2 kids , and our best friend, we already knew to expect to bring about 700 bucks more or less. Since, we are not big on alcohol we opted for just water all around, and a couple of ice teas. Me and my husband had the american rib cap it's delicious , my kids both shared a 32oz porterhouse which was just average. My kids definitely loves the sticky toffee pudding .I would say pass on the sliders for the appetizer because its not worth the price for 2 pieces. So I think with our second trip to this place I would say it was a hit and miss. If your a total reward member you get a little discount on food.
My bf and I just ate here. We had the beef Wellington, Mac n cheese and the toffee pudding for dessert. After everything was done I told my bf I wished we had just come for the dessert, the rest of our meal was just ok and not worth the price. We agreed with others that the beef Wellington was well cooked but lacked flavor. And our server was slower than slow, not at all what I would expect. He acted like he was doing us a favor by serving us, that he had better things to do. Quite disappointed. Only saving grace was the toffee pudding.
On April 9th I had dinner at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant at the Paris hotel in Las Vegas.   Someone may want to inform Mr. Ramsey that this restaurant is in the U.S. and not in England. I couldn't hear the waiter, or other people at the table because of the loud British dance music.. Is this a restaurant or a disco?
It is shocking to me that this restaurant has maintained 4 stars. . . After spending over 1600.00 here (yeah watch out this place is a shakedown) our whole party walked away mocking this sham steakhouse. It is literally a running joke for bad food now. . . You can get a better cut of meat at dennys. The steaks were tough and flavorless - cooked poorly. The sides were boring. The Service was spotty at best. . . Even the desserts were bad - how do you make a bad dessert? . . The seafood platter was passable - but its a steak house... soooo... you cant hang our hat on that.. . There are SO MANY great ways to throw your money away in Vegas - please folks - skip this one!. . GORDON RAMSAY - Spend more time in your own kitchens and less time mugging for the camera 'fixing' other peoples. . . The worst steakhouse I have EVER been to.
This gonna be a short review because this Ramseys signature place in LV. First of all staff is top of the line, in true Ramsey style, if your not in the mood for steak I would say dont waste your time here as the expirence is worth the whole thing. I had to have Gordon signature dish and I would say on you first time have this. The Beef Wellington was extraordinary and pared with an exquisite big red you will agree with me.
I always come in with low expectations for Strip restaurants, since you are often paying for the name and not always the food. Or the food may be amazing, but so tiny in portion that you leave hungry.  Boy,  I was totally wrong about this place, mind blowing level of amazing food!  We went here for my bachelorette party dinner and we were seated upstairs in a side room for a group of 8.  Staring with the bread, they had prosciutto brioche, black truffle brioche, a lemony ciabatta, and one additional bread.  The bread was warm when it arrived to the table, already a good start to the meal.  We ordered the Kurobuta pork belly and grits appetizer x 2 and the fried blue point oysters.  Both of these were delicious and we ended up scraping the plate for the rest of the cheesy grits.  The creme fraiche tarter sauce was creamy goodness paired with the perfectly fried oysters.  On to the entrees, normally I go ribeye at steakhouses butafter watching enough episodes of Hell's Kitchen and Master Chef, how can you not order the Beef Wellington?!  But as a compromise, my friend and I shared the Wellington and also shared a 24 oz ribeye (both medium rare).  I like that they bring the butcher's cart out with all the different cuts of meat and explain the marbling and quality of each so you know what you are getting.  We also ordered the brussel sprouts, loaded baked potato, and mac and cheese for sides to share.  Overwhelmingly, the Beef Wellington was the highlight of the meal.  The meat literally melts in your mouth as you take each bite!  I would order this over steak any day.  The other strange thing is the Beef Wellington is less than $60 and so was the 24 oz ribeye.  Normally, I expect to pay upwards to $80+ for steakhouses on the Strip.  I was baffled by the lower than expected price and the higher than expected quality.  For any Chinese person, this is a win win situation!  The ribeye was marbled perfectly and seasoned to perfection as well.  But hands down I would order the Beef Wellington again, next time I come here.  The portion size is also very large, we easily could have shared either the ribeye or the wellington and not ordered another entree.  The sides were also good, I would probably pass on the loaded baked potato next time but the mac and cheese was flavorful and creamy.  The brussel sprouts were crispy and the acidity from the vinaigrette paired beautifully.  To cap off an amazing meal, we ordered the famous sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream.  I thought it would be overly sweet, but I mean this is probably one of the best desserts I have ever had.  The ice cream paired with the moist cake was indescribable!  For your next any kind of celebration come here....or just make up a reason to come!
This restaurant was everything I had hoped for. The service was incredible and the food even better. My dining companion and I both ordered the limited edition Hells Kitchen menu, of which they will only serve 2000. We were number 249 and 250. We did splurge on the caviar and by far the best presentation ever. The famous Wellington is divine. If you are in Vegas, I highly recommend this restaurant, or better said, experience.
I went here with a party of 6, we were greeted by everyone who worked there with a smile & welxome. The atmosphere is upscale, everyone was dressed up. The service was great. All the waiter worked together very well, the presentation was very informative and sweet. The food was great! I order the seafood dish, and it was delicious! The husband order primerib and it was thick and tendon! The price is $$$$ but like "Drake" says "YOLO"
We went to Gordon Ramsey Steak for my husbands birthday celebration.  Staff is very friendly. Strawberry martini was fabulous, appetizers, bread , butter, we're all very very good. Husband ordered beef Wellington and I had beef short ribs and they were both amazing. Tried buttery toffee pudding for desert and it was heaven. I have to say it was the best dining experience ever.
There are so many steak restaurants in Las Vegas, but me and my GF had to try Gordan Ramsay. We've watched him so many times on TV. IF you wanna try a more economical Gordan Ramsay, there are Gordan Ramsay burger places too. We'll try those next time.. . I will rave about their service. They were always very prompt and very kind. We were probably the youngest customers that night, but we felt we were still treated with amazing service. When we thought our Beef Wellington was a little overcooked, they gave us two new pieces. That was pretty unbelievable. . . The only reason I'd give this place 4/5 stars is because we thought the Beef Wellington should have come out perfect the first time. IT was a lot better the second time. The Beef Wellington is supposed to be their specialty. Something that is quite unique.. . If you're interested in some of the philosophy behind the restaurant, ask your server about the weird/interesting design on the ceiling. IT'll definitely make you look at Gordan Ramsay differently.
Go for the novelty, not the chef. . . We had quite the choices on where to grab a prime steak in LV, and being that we're there every few months and based on the freshness and gorgeous presentations of something as simple as Plane Food Heathrow, the food at London NY and LA,  how could we go wrong with a multi- Michelin star chef?. . You don't go to GRS for a steak, you go for a to experience a cheap intimation of the set of Hell's Kitchen.  Garishly loud, with bad 80's  music cranked so loudly I was expecting  American Psycho's Patrick Bateman to sit at the table next to me, however being that it seems the restaurant has no sense of dress code it's safe to say that won't happen either. . . The one reason I gave it two stars is for the foie gras. Beautifully prepared. The maple glaze really made it stand out. . . The brussel sprouts with cider vinaigrette horrifically burned and soggy. And that cider....so much cider vinaigrette that it made our eyes burn.  Our waiter took one whiff and said "wow".. . The  rare rib-eye was incredibly well-done, and my Glaswegian Mrs. fish and chips was a soggy train wreck. I sent my steak back and it took the kitchen 45 minutes to get me back a MEDIUM-WELL rib-eye. . . I will say management did reach out, acknowledged the problems and took the entrees off the bill. . . I appreciate management's earnest, however I can't be a fan of an executive owner/chef/television-celebrity  who clearly runs a "glass house"  restaurant.
This restaurant by far surpassed our expectations! We had the best service and food we've ever eaten at any restaurant.. . We tried several appetizers including the gnocchi, stuffed lobster tail (which had lentils in bisque and it was phenomenal), pork belly, and beef tartar which comes out with garlic potato chips and was to die for!! . . For dinner I had the beef Wellington and my husband had the american beef rib cap. The rib cap has marbling throughout so it was pretty rich, tasted fabulous!! The beef Wellington didn't disappoint, so much flavor!! Be prepared though, it does have a longer preparation time. For accompaniments we had the sauteed mushrooms (divine), Brussel sprouts, and Mac n cheese. My husband said the brussel sprouts were very tasty and the mushrooms were as well. The Mac n cheese was good, just a little heavy on the truffle.. . Dessert had always been my favorite meal, so we had to sample a few. By far the sticky toffee pudding with caramel ice cream is the best dessert I've ever had!! It's worth the entire trip!! We also had the apple tart tatin which comes out nice and hot and the waiter places the wonderful cinnamon ice cream on top so it's served a la mode. The cinnamon ice cream is so smooth and delicious!! My husband is a peanut butter lover so he tried the peanut butter bar which he said was his favorite.. . Our service was phenomenal!! We had Matthew and Derrick as our servers. They were extremely attentive and were always there before we even realized we needed anything. Matthew was also very good in knowing the menu and made some recommendations for us. . . By far this is one of the best restaurants in town!!
This was my first time at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and it definitely left me with a very good impression.. . I really had no expectations when I walked in, since I really had no idea what to expect. Some reviews say the decor was tacky, but I actually liked it. We had made reservations and were seated upstairs. It was cool seeing the whole restaurant layout from above. . . Service was great too. Our water cups were never empty. When you are first seated, you are given an iPad with an interactive drink menu on it. You are also given the limited edition tasting menu that supposedly highlights the dishes made in Hell's Kitchen. The tasting menu also comes with an autographed picture of Gordon Ramsey. If you ordered the tasting menu, you get to take it home as a souvenir. Although I am a fan of the show, all I really wanted to try was the beef wellington so I opted out of the tasting menu. . . We had a show to make so we didn't order much, especially with the beef wellington taking 45 minutes to make. The boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and we also got the brussel sprouts for a side. While we waited for our food, the bread came. . . I have to stop here and talk about the bread plate because I can't stop thinking about it!! The bread plate came with four different types of bread: lemon olive oil foccacia, prosciutto brioche, black truffle brioche, and I don't remember the last one. It was served warm, which made it taste even better. My favorites were definitely the prosciutto brioche and foccacia. We devoured the first plate VERY quickly and even though we knew we had to save room for our entrees, we just had to ask for a second plate. SO GOOD. I wish there was a bakery section because I would totally buy a whole batch of the bread to take home.. . Now, the entrees. The beef wellington was very good! It was cooked perfectly. The meat was very tender. Make sure to get a little of everything on the plate in each bite because the flavors all go together just right. The fish and chips (truffle fries) was also very good too, fried just right. The portions for both dishes were perfect. We were satisfied, but also not overstuffed. The brussel sprouts side was kind of meh. I think there was too much vinegar in it, but we'll just put that aside and remember the food that blew me away. . . Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal and experience here. When you go to Vegas, you are expected to splurge on the food. This splurge was definitely well worth it!
Just perfect. . . So many places do not know how to cook a steak well done. I know, I know, well, I am crazy. BUT, anything less than well grosses me out. Luckily, they did an amazing job, the steak was well done, YET, still tender. AH-MAZE-ING. The hubby and a friend had the beef wellington, and the other person in our party had bone in rib eye which he raved about. Our server was super nice. Great place, yummy food, must try.
Lets forget the food for a second.. . Our waiter was the mostknowledgeable and prepared that i have ever had. He could answer any question that we had and he was able to present everything the restaurant had to offer without being scripted. (and we have all had those painful experiences with the scripted wait staff). . Now the food. We ordered the Smoked Beef Tartar, Gordon Ramsey's Famous Beef Wellington, Veal Chop, and Sauteed Mushrooms. I honestly don't know what to say.  Everything was perfect. The wellington was everything that we had dreamed of after watching it get prepared for many years on the Food network and other such programs. The beef tartar was the first tartar that I have ever eaten and it was phenomenal. I could taste every component and the apple wood smoke flavor and aroma stayed with the meat for the duration of the course. The veal was perfectly cooked with a beautiful sear, spot on doneness, and the Guinness infused grainy mustard and red wine demi glace brought the meat to a whole other level. . . I have nothing negative to say. The environment was fantastic. Good music that wasn't too loud, great decor (I especially loved finding out the the odd neon lights hanging from the ceiling were modeled after the hand movement the Gordon Ramsey used to prepare his signature Beef Wellington), and the staff was always there to assist with anything concern I may have had.. . It doesn't hurt that they had Innis & Gunn on tap either. (The Canadian Cherry wood to be exact)
Great food at first service seems speedy but then lags during serving but the good made up for it!!!!
It's one of my dreams to meet Chef Ramsay and just have him cuss me out, call me a 'donkey', and tell me to have some 'ballocks' or something.... yes yes, I'd like to actually like to cook alongside him as well or even host my wedding whenever it is I get married..... . I became a huge Chef Ramsay fan after moving from Anchorage, Alaska in 2010 after graduating college and moving away to a completely new place where my TV was my first new friend there. One thing led to another and I found myself watching Kitchen Nightmares (the European edition... then to the American edition). I began to truly enjoy food, whether cooking it (as I learned), or eating it in a whole new light. Kitchen Nightmares led to Hells Kitchen... so on so forth you all get the drift (especially some Chef Ramsay fans).... and now I have two books, have cooked Chef Ramsay's signature dish - 'the Beef Wellington'. And ate at the MAZE in NYC with a couple of friends when I visited the "city". That place was on point. Even made me that much more of a fan.... but really to the point... . Gordon Ramsay Steak was amazing. From the minute you walked in, the ambiance matched the food and the service... just phenomenal. You might think I'm bias cause I'm a Chef Ramsay fan as stated above but clearly... Gordon Ramsay knows what the heck he's doing. From all his michelin stars... the passion that overflows from the man from what you see from his shows, and the perfection he drives and excels for is shown through the restaurants he's made in his name ... down to the core of what it's all about... the food.. . It was the best steak I've ever had.... I do set the challenge that I can cook a mean asparagus side that I would have rather had because mine were slightly undercooked... but that didn't even cause a scene because of how much the amazing steak, the drinks that accompanied and the service that kept things going. . . The staff are amazing there. Friendly... there exactly when you need them, and at a distance when you'd like them to be at too. Somehow they just knew exactly where to be and how to be. Phenomenal.
My boyfriend and I are huge Gordan Ramsey fans. He particularly likes the Kitchen Nightmares and Hotel Hells. I like the Hells Kitchen and Masterchef. So since we were in Vegas we decided that we needed to try Gordan Ramsey's steak. I made reservations in advance and as soon as we arrived they seated us. . Once you step into Gordan Ramsey steak the atmosphere is so different than in the rest of the Paris Hotel. The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing. Pretty upbeat. The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood. Talk about service, first off they use an ipad so you van browse your drink selection. Pretty cool I would say. I would recommend getting a Total Rewards card and save a couple dollars here and there but the food was well worth the price.. We ordered a fillet of steak, clam chowder, duet of lamb, Mac and cheese and asparagus. The food was really good. My duet of lamb included a small shepherds pie and some lamb. The lamb was great and the garnish tasted very yummy. I was not really impressed by the shepherds pie but it's okay. The Mac and cheese was very good. . The service was great in itself. The waitress was on top of things and so were the rest of the staff. Everyone was smiling and friendly. I remember when my boyfriend left to use the restroom and the waiter took his napkin and folded it. Quite impressed.
If I could give it 10 stars I would.  It was my 4th time dining at GR Steak and I've NEVER been more impressed with all aspects of the experience.  There isn't a damn thing on the menu that doesn't live up to expectations.  Period.  . . There is nothing in Vegas that compares.  Best place in the entire city.
This was food porn. It started immediately with cocktails through the main meal. We skipped desert because the meal was that delicious. Our serving team of Charles and Alexis were exceptional -- very knowledgeable and gave us excellent recommendations. We went in expecting to order the Hell's Kitchen tasting menu, but didn't. And let me tell you I am very happy we didn't. Pork belly appetizer was the BEST piece of pork I ever ate and the kobe rib cap the BEST piece of beef ever. Hands down, the best dining experience ever from ambiance to food to presentation to staff. Don't miss this!!. . Oh and awesome music!
This was my second time at the restaurant and I was not disappointed. This place is amazing, the whole experience was great.. . My boyfriend and I initially had reservation for 730, but my he was doing well In a poker tournament so we knew we were going to bit late. We called they and told the hostess about our situation, and she immediately told us that is was fine and pushed back our reservation, and wished him good luck in the tournament.. . When we arrived at the restaurant we were warmly greeted and taken to our table.. . Our waiter was amazing! Super friendly. I ordered a Caesar salad, and the braised beef short ribs, and my bf ordered the bone in rib eye with a side of the fingerling potatoes, a glass of Merlot and the sticky toffee pudding.. . A few minutes after ordering our waiter came back to our table to because he though he forgot to take my drink order, but I told him that I just didn't like to drink alcohol and that I was fine with just water. . . My dish was so good, best short ribs I have ever so much flavour and incredibly tender had and the salad was also delicious. I also had a taste of he fingerling potatoes which were also delicious.. . The only thing that I didn't care for was the sticky toffee pudding, but to be fair, I didn't order it and I don't care for bread pudding to begin with. However it came with an AMAZING brown butter ice cream, when I told our waiter how delicious it was he offered to bring me some extra(which he did not charge us for). . . Before he brought us the bill he asked is if we had a total reward card, we did but we had forgotten it in our room, he said there was nothing he could do about the point, bit that he could give us the discount. The bill came up to a little over $140. Which was well worth it. . . I will defiantly have to come back on my next trip to Vegas.. . Just a heads up the side dishes are enormous one order is more then enough for 2.
We went to this place a couple years ago. It is the BEST meal we have ever had.. . The service was unbelievable. They really took the time and effort to take it to the next level. When my gf asked where the restroom was they stopped what they were doing and took the time to walk her there instead of just pointing her in the direction.. Also they had a wheel of steak they brought out to show and describe to you the different cuts of meat. It was very informative and made deciding much easier.. . I had the kobe beef filet steak and it was melt in your mouth delicious. They also had a wide range of selection for drinks including Innis & Gunn on draught which was great. Lastly our dessert we had the chocolate peanut butter bar which was amazing. My gf had a cake dessert with smore ice cream on top. The ice cream tasted just like a campfire smore and was so good.. . This is an expensive restaurant but they back it up with their food and service. It is worth it for a splurge on a trip.
My wife and I went here for our ten year anniversary. our reservation was for April 23 2014 at 6:00pm. Not a real busy time. We where extremely excited to go here and had made the reservation in advance. We enjoy watching Hells Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares, and The F-Word and have seen that chef Ramsey seemd to have high food standards. After eating there we realized that it wasn't what we thought it will be. The Music was extremely loud. It was so loud that my wife and I couldn't have a conversation. We sat there not being able to talk to talk to each other. I couldn't even hear the waiter. That wouldn't matter much becuase he didn't seem to want to pay much attention to us any way. The buser paid more attention to us and made sure that our drinks where filled. I wish he would have be our server instead. My wife ordered spear ribs. They tasted decent but mainly fat and bone. Not worth the price. I was trying to decide between the Beef Wellington and the bone in Rib Eye. I choose the Rib Eye. It was not a good choice. It lacked seasoning and was over cooked. The bone in rib eye is my favorite cut of meat and I have had it other places. It wasn't nearly as good as I have had in the past. The one highlight from our visit was the bread plate it was amazing. But the bread shouldn't out shine the meal in my opinion. I don't normally like to write bad reviews, but this time I thought I should.
First I need to say that I'm obsessed with everything Gordon Ramsay and was so excited we were able to get reservations for our anniversary trip here.  Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations.  . . I had the infamous beef Wellington, which I've never had before.  The pastry was soggy underneath the meat, and the meat was so flavorless.  The boyfriend had the rib cap, which was to DIE for!  If given the opportunity to go back, this would be my number 1 choice.  We ordered the bone marrow along with truffle mac n cheese.  Bone marrow tasted like raw beef fat and has a very unpleasant array of green herbs placed on top (pestoish).  The Mac n cheese was really just ok.. . As for dessert, we had the sticky toffee pudding.  OMG!!!  Best thing hands down.  I would go back just for that dessert alone.  If you love carmel tasting sweet cake, go for it!
2nd visit here last night - nothing but praise for the great restaurant.  Not the place to go if you are trying to save some money but fun for a splurge night out. The wait staff and hostesses give impeccable service. I was particularly impressed with mohamabu (sp?). He kept this pancetta bread loving girl well stocked all night and seemed to actually really enjoy and take pride in his work.  Food was amazing - perfectly cooked steak, delicious truffle fingerling potatoes, and finished off with the most ridiculously melty rich yummy sticky toffee pudding.  The music was also great!
Awesome experience!  Although the restaurant is in the casino area, you feel like you're in a completely different environment once you enter the restaurant.  You walk through a short tunnel to enter, and there is a piece of lighted artwork in the center of the cieling.  The beef wellington was tender and delicious, and the beef sliders were so juicy and flavorful!!  I also enjoyed their platter of various breads and salted butter.  The service was great too!
I was in town this week so I had to come back here and see if it was as great as I remembered and it totally was. . I had the spring tasting menu which consisted of  scotch egg for amuse bouche,  beet salad, scallop risotto, beef Wellington and sticky toffee pudding for dessert.  I can't even find words for how fantastic everything was! I don't even like beets and I ate every bite of that salad! As you eat the risotto you hear Ramsey's voice screaming how a risotto should be cooked and his chefs definitely listened because it was perfect.  The Wellington is always great and I have figured out how to cut it so I get meat and pastry in each bite. And of course that dessert is the best dessert EVER!  If you could only afford one thing here get that, it is so amazing.  Also received bread to start and it took every ounce of control not to eat all 6 pieces. . Service was so good. I wish I could remember their names because they know how to treat a person..   Only downside was at my Wellington course a couple was seated next to me and the woman had enough perfume on to choke a horse. I don't understand these women  that bathe in perfume but especially when you are going to dinner and part of the experience is the smell of the food not your bug spray perfume!!
Go here and at least order the Sticky Toffee Pudding dessert!!. . I ate here back in October with my cousins and boyfriend and it was an experience we'll never forget! . . First off, our server Adrian was THE BEST! He made our dining experience memorable with his fast and personable service. He offered to take our picture when our food came, he cracked jokes with us and he came back at the end of the night to tell us we were his favorite table. . . As for the food: I had the bone in Rib-eye which was one of the best steaks I've ever had! My cousin had the rib cap which was superb! The chicken and the porkchop were also delicious, as were our sides of haricot vert, asparagus and potatoes. We were all pleased and stuffed. . . And then the dessert came. STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING. OH MY GOODNESS. It was just pure amazement. I took a piece of the warm cake, added a spoonful of the ice cream (shaped like a stick of butter!) and as soon as I tasted this concoction, the clouds parted and the heavens opened up to a joyful choir. It was pure bliss that I didn't want to end. It's one of those foods that reflexively make you eyes close and your lips hum out "Mmmm". . . I cannot wait to go back to Vegas just for this dessert! My mouth is literally watering just thinking of it.
Arrived just before closing without a reservation. Party of 5 of us sat in the bar & ordered dinner. Music is loud in the bar. I'm not sure if it's the same in the dining area. Everything was great. Highly recommend. Of course a reservation with a table in dining room probably would have been a 5 star. I recommend ordering any of the steaks. The side of mac & cheese was awesome too!
I was not all that impressed. Downstairs is an interesting modern restaurant. We sat upstairs which felt like an old conference room.  They are very pretentious with their oh-so-special gordon ramsay affiliation: "this is the hand motion chef ramsay makes when cooking blah blah. This is the drink menu on chef ramsay's ipad.". . The food was fine, but nothing great. That was the consensus for all in our 6 person party. . . The service was surprisingly bad. We went on the late side, so they weren't especially busy, but everything took a really long time, even simple things like getting the check or more bread. . . I would definitely choose Delmonico or Craft Steak over going here again.
It is worth going for the food.  Service was just so so; our server seemed confused when we asked questions about the food.  The water server was much more pleasant and happy than our table server.  I did not understand the ambiance of the place:  elegant food, modern decor, but the music was nonsensical noise; way too loud and I don't even know what kind of music it was.  Just didn't make sense to me at all.  I was served a glass of wine from a bad bottle and feel the server should have known it, or the bartender, as it was a Pinot Grigio and the color was orange!  My chair was also broken and it is a good thing I noticed it BEFORE I sat on it.  Other than that, it was great fun to eat and experience Chef Ramsay's food, finally!!!!  My husband had the steak, and it was cooked correctly, but the flavor was just average.  It needed a little pizzazz. Though, the lobster mac and cheese is unlike anything you've had before.  Just super creamy and cheesey!   I had the fish and chips, andit was delicious - the batter was very light and crispy.  The wine selection is limited, but you should find what you like on it.  The appetizer shrimp cocktail is amazing and fun to look at!  I've seen the steak presentation at other restaurants, so I knew what to expect, but I don't think our server was particularly helpful in that area......he seemed too distracted and rushed.  It is worth a try for a special occasion and if you have some cash to spend.
The ONLY thing good about this place is the hot waitresses/hostesses in sexy outfits. That gets 8 stars. . . The steak is good. But so what? Any dope can buy good quality meat, toss it on the grill and add some butter. Hell, I can get the same quality at home. . . I only came here because a client wanted to buy me dinner here. . . The design of this place is pretty awful. Very cheap quality finishes all around. Ikea quality. This is not what you expect from a place charging $60+ for a steak. The bathroom looks like a basic Home Depot job. Cheap chairs. Cheap carpet. Stupid neon "sculpture" on ceiling. . . The place plays very loud music, probably to get people to eat fast, and move along for next ass to fill a seat. . . You can tell that Gordon Ramsay is a cheap and stingy twat by the quality of this place. Taking advantage of the poor rubes who come here for a "fine dining" experience.
