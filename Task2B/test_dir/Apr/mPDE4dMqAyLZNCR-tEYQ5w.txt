Be prepared to be transported into another world by Cirque Du Soleil. With a story of many dimensions including world class performers and music to suck you in, I attended KA while I was in Vegas and it did not disappoint.. . To me, KA had more of a storyline compared to Dralion but it was a darker story than Ovo and the acrobatics were great but not as amazing as the other shows I have seen. Perhaps this is because there is so much happening in a big venue or I was concentrating on the story more.. . I got my ticket via tix4tonite in Vegas on the day.
When they actually did acrobatics they were amazing. The story line is very hard to follow and jumps around all over. There are to many slow scenes that drag and made me loose interest. The last "fight scene" was digital because they can not perform it live since one of the acrobats died acting it out. It wasn't horrible I just think I was expecting more acrobatics. The ushers are very entertaining
Our family absolutely loved Ka. You have to follow the story closely through the action because the "script" , after the introduction of the story plot at the begnning, is not really language. But the acrobatics, the set, the action sequences are extraodinary. My wife couldn't even watch a few times as the acrobatics were just too perilous to believe. The performers really risk it all, every show, twice a day five days a week. You have never seen anyting like this.  After the tragic death of one of the performers last summer[ due to an equipment failure), one sequence at the end is projected onto a screen. I think this was the weakest part of the show. The sequence could be recreated, or maybe some explaination of why this is done could be given, either in introducing the show, or maybe have a program printed for the audience. But aside from that few minutes that don't reach the level of the rest of the performance, it is just jaw-dropping amazing. I don't know if there are occassional hiccups and misses in other performances of Ka, but the show we saw was flawless for the entire hour and half production. It was my first Cirque show, so I don't have others to compare too. But now I am a true fan and want to see other shows someday. My only real regret was that the audienced didn't give the performers a standing ovation at the end. But they probably couldn't stand up that quickly after drinking all day as most visiting Las Vegas seem to do. Leave your iphones in your pocket, you can't take pics before or during the show. The ushers spent an inordinate amount of time trying to police the ubiquitous cell-cams before the show. I feel bad for the performers who read unkind reviews posted here. It must be disheartening where the talent on display is nothing short world-class.
I was BLOWN away by KA, so much so that I am still listening to the soundtrack a week later trying to relive every single last bit so I won't forget. The music, the story, it all brought me intense waves of emotion. I've never felt anything like this with ANY performance I've seen, and having been in Theatre most of my life that definitely says a lot!. . Levels of walkways surround the seats where performers propel from and entertain the crowd before the show. It's just so aesthetically pleasing, and makes the audience feel as if they are a part of the action and adventure!. . And then... the stage. It's a hydraulic stage that moves up, down, slanted and even VERTICAL; It's unbelievable how talented the performers are to stabilize themselves and act with such grace. In other cirque shows I usually see many mistakes, but at KA not a single one! The actors were so well rehearsed and on point!. . I am itching to go back to Vegas just so I can see the show again! It's almost a manic obsession... Well worth the price, and you can get great deals through MLife. I am even flirting with the idea of moving to Nevada just so I can work as an Usher at the KA theater so I can be a part of this amazing experience!!!
I've seen a few of these types of shows in Las Vegas:  Le Reve, Zumanity and now KA.  I have not seen the other Cirque shows so I cannot compare this to those, but KA on its own is a sheer spectacle.  Amazing sets, performers and a giant rotating wall that serves as the back "drop" for most of the scenes.  The performers in this show are clearly not afraid of heights, falling or death (some stunts are done without a wire).. . I would totally recommend this to a friend and I would see it again if I could get discounted tickets.  We purchased our tickets through Travelzoo for 50% off the regular price and we got seats at about the middle-left of the seating sections which was near enough to see the actor's faces but far enough to see more of the action that wasn't necessarily on-stage.
Well put together show. I was amazed through its entirety. Even had some laughs. I'd say a must see.
The performers and stage are awesome in KA. We actually got discounted tickets for this show. The way that the stage is set up there's really no bad seats,so I don't really think it would be worth extra money for the middle center section.
This is a fantastic theatrical performance by all means take the time to catch this performance!!!!!!
It makes me very sad to write this review. I had given this show five stars and said it was my favorite Cirque du Soleil and Las Vegas show.. . This is the second time I have seen the show. My wife and I loved it so much we took our kids to see the show and paid $165 per ticket for the most expensive tickets available - ~$720 for four with fees.. . So why the one star? They took out the most exciting and unique scene from the entire show - the final battle scene on the vertical wall - and replaced it with a low resolution video of the final battle scene on the vertical wall. I am not making this up.. . That's like:. . 1) Going to an opera and watching the final climactic scene on 1970's era video with mono audio.. 2) Going to a concert and realizing the singers were all lip-syncing and the guitars and other instruments were not even plugged in.. 3) Paying $40K a year for college and finding out that the courses are all online.. . After the scene was finished, there was *zero* applause from the audience - there was a collective "WTF did I just witness?!" silence. Keep in mind: That scene is the finale, the climax, the coup de grace, and they showed a low resolution *video*. Are you f'ing kidding me?! You cannot be serious.. . I know the story behind this - there was a fatality on that scene in June 2013. Very sad, but there are an average 58 deaths of commercial fishermen per year in the US, and people are somehow still eating fish. The Ka Theatre seats 950 and the average ticket price is ~$125, so that's ~$120,000 in revenue per show, or a quarter of a million dollars per night. The show plays 5 nights a week, so that's $65 million a year in revenue. Discount that to $50 million a year for some time off, unsold tickets, discounted, tickets, etc. . . If the equipment needs upgrading, upgrade it. If the performers need more training, train them. But replacing the grand finale with a video 9 months after the incident? Absolutely shocking. Guy Laliberte should be ashamed.. . ---. . Edit: Below is the response from Cirque du Soleil. Translation: "Watch the low-res video of the climactic scene and shove it up your &*$&". . Bonjour ,. . We received your letter and would like to thank you for sharing your thoughts with us.  We appreciate your comments as our shows are constantly evolving and input from our fans is very important to us.. . Cirque du Soleil's creators have always wanted to explore new creative platforms.  KA was born of our philosophy of always pushing the limits of creativity for all aspects of a show including artistic and technical concepts.  As with all forms of art, it is a very personal experience and everyone reacts differently to every show.. . In order to complete the storyline of KA, we are using a special projection of The Battle Scene until the full act returns to the show.. . The Battle scene will return to the show when we believe that our artists are completely comfortable performing it again. We have not begun rehearsing the act in any capacity at this time.. . Nevertheless, we respect your opinions, and will share your comments with our creative department.. . Once again, we thank you for your constructive remarks and sincerely hope that the next production will better meet your expectations.. . If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.
I was so excited to see Ka. I had heard so many great things about it. Last year I went to see my first Cirque show ever, Love, and I loved it. Ka is the story of a brother and sister who are separated after their kingdom is attacked. There is a love story interspersed in the plot though it's not very believable and just seemed to detract from the show as a whole. Basically, the love story was a bit of a plot mover rather than something explored. . . The costumes were great and everything was well choreographed. However, at times I felt that it was monotonous. "Oh hey, another fight scene on the moving wall". The most disappointing thing was the climax. I understand that the performer died last year, that's a terrible tragedy. However, instead of altering the scene and having them perform on a level surface, they just made up a CGI of the characters fighting on the vertical wall. It was blurry and you couldn't tell what was going on. . . I actually think Love was better.
Got tickets for this through myvegas, and let's just say cirque is not for me. I think the show wasn't that interesting but they had some cool stunts. I KNOW this is 100% me and it's not their fault since my wife loved every bit of it and it seemed they've put a lot of effort in decoration, stage, etc. The cocktails at the bar were pretty good and also really affordable for vegas terms, esp. the refills.
My first Cirque du Soleil show. Tickets were about $100/each, will call.. . I wasn't really sure what to expect, so I enjoyed the performance. The action is dispersed, but I'd say the bulk of things still happen at the front of the stage. No photography permitted.. . The coolest thing is probably the stage itself. It probably cost a fortune to build, design, and test that thing. It moves with at least five degrees of freedom, and is definitely a big part of the show, and the things they can do within it.
There were a couple of scenes where it was a little repetitive.   Costumes were great.  Great transitions.   A good show for the whole family.
We have enjoyed this show twice in the past, but this was the first time since the show was revamped as a result of mid-2013 fatal accident by one of the performers.  In my opinion, the show is far less dramatic/acrobatic than in the past.  I actually became bored at one point.
I felt that this is a decent show. I absolutely loved the atmosphere in the room. It seemed reminiscent of a steampunk vibe. The ushers were friendly and entertaining. The music is fantastic and really pulls you in to the story. The costumes and sets are incredible. The moving stages are the most insane thing I've ever seen. On occasion, you can see the mechanics behind the stages, and you are left in awe of how they came up with such an immense project such as this.. . I like that there is a storyline that you can really follow with this performance. When I saw Mystere, I couldn't really tell you what the story was, but I felt that Mystere had more of the "Cirque" appeal. This performance was more of a dance in martial arts movements. There is a scene where they do shadow puppets and that was really impressive. I didn't realize you could create things that intricate with it. The brother finding the girl he liked wasn't out of place, but the sister falling in love with the Tarzan-y thing seemed off. All I could think was that he looked too old for her. She looked 14 and he looked 20. It was almost creepy that he was falling for a child. I know they say it's a coming of age story, but you never know what age that would actually be in that time period.. . I was left feeling with a bit of a lackluster feeling where I just wasn't blown away with it. The final scene is supposed to be an epic battle done while the main stage is vertical. Because of the death last year, they have changed it to a CGI version projected onto the stage. It was blurred because it was trying to move fast, so I couldn't really tell who these characters were supposed to be. They should invest in a better version of it, or have the platform be less elevated so that the performers can safely perform the scene. It leaves you feeling let down. When the scene is over, they bring out the actors so you can link the characters on the projection with their physical counterpart, but that left me even more let down. This performance didn't have some of the aspects of the show that you would come to expect from a "Cirque" performance, so I think that's what left me with the most disappointment. . . This is still a good performance, but for about $100 per seat (almost $200 for closer to the front) I felt that it could have been a bit more impressive.
KA is a great show. I took my wife this past weekend for our 8th anniversary. We both truly enjoyed the show. There is nothing that can beat how awesome the stage is in this show. The movement and story are pretty great. It is also really neat how the show is going on all around you. They come out into the audience and it really feels like you are part of the show. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because there is a part at the very end that projected onto the stage. This is kind of lame considering the awesomeness of the entire show. I understand some of the performers died and that may be why they use the projection on that portion. To be honest it looks kind of like you are watching a video game. This part was okay, but considering it along with the rest of the show kind of brought the coolness factor down. But regardless, I would still see this show again. it is very cool.
KA celebrates it's tenth anniversary this year and has provided wonderful entertainment throughout it's residency at MGM, but it has been overshadowed by the other Cirque shows on the strip. The show is alright, but the stage and theatre is gorgeous! You spend the preshow time just staring at the beautiful theatre and metal work.. . After an accident last year, they've changed the last big scene. With the new scene the show feels cheap and unfinished. I wish they would rework it to create another impressive ending.. . It is worth seeing at a discount, but please go check out some of their other shows if you only have time for one or two shows.
I spent the first 30 minutes amazed by the work of industrial art that is the KA stage. Some serious engineering went into this production. Unfortunately, the rest of the show falls short of the high expectations I had for it. Im an intelligent man, but as far as the story goes, I have no clue what happened. Probably because I spent more time creeping the stage intricacies than I did watching the show. The rest of our group shared the same sentiments, and what not our favorite Cirque performances. . . The modified ending is just terrible. As another reviewer mentioned, you can find the original scene that was replaced due to the tragic accident that occurred. The new scene is just awful, like it was done with a camcorder from the 80s. . . In the end, if you've seen the other productions, you might as well see KA, but if its going to be your first Cirque Du Soleil production, you are better off going elsewhere.
Went with a friend for a week in vegas and we wanted to see a circus du soleil show. I wanted to see O but they were no shows available So, I decided on KA and we were not disappointed. The theater/stage was amazing. The show was breathtaking, We sat in awe of how skilled and beautiful the the performers were. Highly recommend this show.
I saw this show when it first opened and just came back from a return trip almost ten years later with the kids.  It seems Cirque has given up on this show, and now I have, too.  There were some awe inspiring moments and exceptional performances.  However, the decision to replace the battle scene with a blurry projected version rather than to restage it had the effect of crippling the show.  It seems Ka is on its way out.
Artistically amazing with the most incredible performance stage you can imagine.. . At the same time, we felt this was slow, artsy, and a bit melancholy.. . If my BEATLES LOVE experience was 5 stars, than this is 3.  Just wasn' t our cup of tea.. . Singing in a language i dont know and a story that was hard to follow.
Literally, this show is the definition of defying gravity! Breath taking acrobatics and amazing immersion defines this show.. . The short definitions:. Pros:. Amazing moving stage. Immersive story about love and growth for two imperial twins as they search for each other and to restore their kingdom. Great costume design. . Cons:. Way too much martial arts. Lack of variety of shows. Removal of the final act which was replaced with low quality CGI. . Here is a more in-depth review of the various acts:. . Pageant- I loved the intro. It just hooks you in with the archers popping up on the side of the stages. Great start!. . Storm- Very acrobatic fight scene on a moving boat. Quite breath taking.. . Deep- Semi-boring but it does make you feel like you're in the water.. . Archers Den- I love the villains. However, not a stand up scene.. . Wash up shore- Freaking hilarious. I really enjoyed the turtle the most. I really liked the sand that they put on stage.. . Shadow play- My favorite scene by far. I really liked the shadow puppets, so life like and quite moving. One of the most beautiful scenes I've seen in a cirque show.. . Climb- Introduction to the epic fight scenes as the characters move around a moving stage packed with sand.. . Blizzard- Pretty cool. I liked the bubbles which they used to imitate snow.. . Flight- One of the coolest scenes from the show as they make a flying apparatus. You literally see the actors fly above the audience.. . Captivity- An interesting scene. I don't really get the love story but whatever. XD.. . Forest people- Awe inspiring and colorful. Very vibrant. I love Tarzan!. . Slave cage- Epic wheel of death! Very cool!. . Final battle- It sucks that this scene was so underwhelming. I'm sure if I saw this scene as it was originally created I would be amazed. However, the holograms were terrible.. . Aftermath- Best part was the flaming wheel! FIRE!. . Overall, my favorite cirque show along with zumanity. Definitely, a good show to introduce yourself to cirque! I really enjoy how there is an actual story line for once!
Absolutely awesome show!
So disappointing.  If this is indicative of all Cirque shows, I don't ever want to go to another one again.  I was soooo excited about this show.  But within 5 minutes of the start I was so bored.. . There was only one good part that lasted about 5 minutes.  Where one of the performers was jump roping on top of a spinning wheel.  Literally.  5 good minutes.  If you enjoy Teletubbie speak, however, you may enjoy this.  Because that's how the actors speak.  . . It's like a bad foreign play.  Luckily, my husband had earned enough My Vegas points for us to get free tickets to this so we didn't waste any money on it.  We got 3 row center and it was almost a disadvantage to be that close.  So don't spend extra to get really close, totally not worth it.  The CGI part was, by far, the lamest and most boring part of the entire show.  . . We also go free tix to see the Jabbawockeez.  SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better than KA!  They were incredible and we laughed and danced in our seats.  Want an 1 and a 1/2 of entertainment??? Go see Jabbawockeez and skip KA!
A solid "4" for sure.  I would advise you don't come here during the last showing, I believe the 9:30pm showing cos it might put you to sleep.  The story line is great and the performance is good but there are parts where the music is super slow.. . Don't pay full price for this either.  You can't get cheap same day tickets from booths all along the strip. I would advise doing that.
