Got kicked out of a casino even when you're over 21! I was sitting with younger relatives, waiting for the rest of our party to be done at the buffet. A worker asked where are parents were; mind you, I am capable to go places without my parents and this worker thought I still needed my parents. This worker continued to tell us we couldn't be on the gaming floor--when we were no where near the gaming floor, or near any slot machine! So embarrassed by this sad establishment. This is clearly a station casino that wishes it were elaborate like the rest of the hotels on the strip. I've never had this happen to me once--not even when I was under 21! . . Stayed in their rooms once and they are so gross.
My wife and 3 of our children decided to celebrate my birthday in Las Vegas!. We rented Four (4) rooms!. I usually try to keep up with my work using my Lap Top!. To accomplish this I must use the Internet!. The WiFi at the RIO is so slow it was impossible for me to conclude any work!. The cost of the WiFi use is included in the resort fee, of $22.00 plus tax!. But only for 1 device. Watch out if you have several phones, ipads, and computers. It is, for 1 device only!  I asked if I could use the Business office or another office and they are all the same!. I felt ripped off and will never stay at the RIO again!. E Wood. Bellevue Washington
I came in yesterday I booked in from hotels for tonight  the line to check in took a while but for some reason the guy gave me an upgrade and gave me an amazing room  with a  nice view on the highest floor
One of the older casinos located off the strip but within a 15 minute walking distance from Las Vegas blvd. Since it is one of the older ones, it doesn't have the amazing ventilation system that the new casinos have. So, you will end up smelling like cigarette smoke when you leave. There also seems to be an older crowd filing the casino from my observations. The rooms are actually pretty nice. Nice, modern and very clean. My favorite was the mini Keurig coffee maker in the bathroom. Nice touch. Don't forget to join their rewards program for $ off your bill at restaurants and to earn points while gambling towards comp rooms and other perks!!. . P.S. The Penn & Teller show is worth seeing!
I brought my family here to spend a couple nights to get away. I had seen the photos on the Rio's website of the rooms they have and chose my room based largely on the "remodeled" nature of the rooms. Our room's "remodel" consisted apparently of new bedding and a new tv. Weird wicker furniture is the rest and it doesn't seem all that impressive or comfortable.. . The TV is placed on a cabinet in the MIDDLE of the windows! My room is a pool view but you can't see out the windows because of the TV and cabinet.... . Worse still overall is the lameness of the pool hours. The pool closes at 6pm. When checkin isn't until 4pm, and there's a line a mile long to checkin, by the time you get to your room and get ready to swim, the pool is closed. Very disappointed children.. . As expected the food here is over-priced, but at least decent quality.. . Just a warning too for others traveling with children or non-romantically linked people.... I'm not sure if this is how it is in all rooms, but there's a WINDOW from the shower into the main part of our room. Not frosted. Not mirrored. Just an open creepy hole in the wall with a piece of glass.
My girlfriend is a high roller so we get free rooms at Ceasars, Ballys, Planet Hollywood, and several other hotels including Rio.  Of course I would prefer Ceasars or Planet Hollywood, but I really like Rio, they have real nice pools and restaurants.  As far as gambling I fell most casinos are pretty much alike.  Yeah the rooms are dated but if you can get a cheap room I don't think you will be disappointed.  . . They have shuttles to the strip that are very convenient too.
we went to rio and stayed there in march the hotels were a good size and fairly clean and a very good price. their seafood buffet was great ! the problem was the valet put a good size smudge on the bumper of the car .it took the valet a while to bring the car up . we did not make a big deal about it at the time seeing that it was a rental and we bought full coverage for the car. it had one of those rear view screens . maybe that was what confused the valet so be careful if you valet there.
I attended a great event at the Rio in one of their ballrooms last weekend. A fun time was had by all. Great music with a live band followed by a DJ. Dancing, partying staying much later than planned. Only 2 stars I did not feel the food was up to par. I have eaten at other Rio restaurants and had better. The wait staff was neutral. No complaints but definitely not memorable. I will come back for the event hopefully it would be better food experience.
Some family came to town to celebrate a birthday so we decided to stay here since we hadn't before and could get such a great deal on hotels.com. I have mixed emotions with this place so here it is -. . Pros:  Got a pretty nice room for only $30. Room was clean and spacious. There's a Starbucks right outside the elevators. Staff is friendly.. . Cons:  Bed and pillows are so uncomfortable I had trouble sleeping and woke up sore. The air conditioner doesn't work very well because we turned the thermostat down to 66 and it still was warm in the room. We have to pay a resort fee and yet we don't get wifi. The give us a keurig coffee maker but no coffee. Called the front desk and was told we have to buy coffee from the mini bar. . . Would we stay here again? I think if we were on a tight budget and couldn't afford something else then we would. At least it's clean. . . Note to self for future visits...... bring my own pillow!
We found the accommodations to be very nice.  We loved the buffet.  It has a great casino with machines we didn't find anywhere else!! The spa was great too.  Would come back!
We didn't stay here but came here for a uh...show and we had a good time!  Rio is where the regular normal people come - no crazy outlandish outfits.  People are regular people who want to play and have fun - I can respect that!  We had a good time and caught a cab quite easily at the front.  They also have these frozen alcoholic drinks at the front of the hotel that you can get served in a cup that changes color when cold drinks are poured in them - my friends enjoyed these and took the cups home as gifts.
For $49 a night, this place wasa steal! I was in town last week for the Megadeth/Motorhead concert down the street at the Palms. Seeing as I didn't wanna drive too far or take a cab to the show, I decided to book at the Rio. I had previously stayed a couple of times before and had pretty good experiences. The room may have felt just a tad bit outdated, but it was still a great deal considering how much I was paying.. . Pros:. - Very spacious and clean room, even if just a bit outdated.. - Front desk was very nice and courteous, both during check in and check out.. - Friendly staff.. - Hotel is right next to I-15, so there's easy highway access.. - Complimentary shuttles to the strip.. . Cons:. - Not too great of a dining selection. You're probably better off finding mom and pop restaurants down the street.. - Off of the strip. This normally means you'll run into some sketchy individuals and some scary areas.. - $20+ charge for checking-in early.
I was very disappointed in my last visit to the Rio. My prior experiences there were 10+ years ago, and things have really gone down hill.  First of all the $60 resort fee, on top of the room rate was a bit excessive....and what do you get?  2 passes to the gym and free Wi-Fi for 1 device?  Unfortunately we couldn't opt out.  We brought our own wine to the hotel, and when we got the room we called down for wine glasses and a cork screw.  We were charge $3 for each of these items.  It seemed ridiculous signing the room service tab for 2 empty glasses and a tool.  The next morning we looked high and low for the coffee to put into the coffee machine that one expects in any hotel.  When we checked the mini bar we found that the coffee was $8 for the equivalent of 3 cups of coffee?  What was I supposed to do, arm wrestle my wife for the last cup?  Could you at least make it big enough for 4.  And again, WHAT was I getting for my $60 resort fee??. . The safe in our room didn't work.  When do you realize this, when you are headed out for the night.  We called and they said they could have someone there in 20 minutes, and that we had to be in the room.  We waited 30 before calling them back and saying never mind.  . . On to the pool area the next day.  One of the hot tubs was closed and they only other one had so much filth and grime and crumbling tile that we just couldn't stomach it.  (It sort of looked like the track on the sliding shower doors in our room....we just couldn't escape it!)  Also, my wife was treated quite disrespectfully by the people in the booth handing out the beach towels. . . We will not be coming back.  Such a shame.
I've been a fan of the Rio in the past, but hadn't stayed here in a while.  On our last trip, we were a bit disappointed by a few things.. . First, the mini bar and coffee hadn't been restocked.  There was NO coffee at all in the room, and the mini bar was over half emptied.  And if there had been coffee, it was going to cost a ridiculous $8 for three pods.. . Otherwise it's pretty good for an older hotel.  The room wasn't perfect but it was in reasonable condition for the age.  The bathrooms are pretty nice and roomy, as is the entire room.  I like the space a lot so you don't feel closed in like most rooms.  Price was in the middle range.
