Today was the first time I have ever been to the Peppermill and unfortunately I was very disappointed. Especially because my friends talked so highly of this place.. . First we checked out the Fireside Lounge and it was happy hour. My friends and I ordered the famous Scorpion drink and MAN it was super strong! For our appetizers we ordered crab cakes, shrimp cocktail and chips and salsa.  The crab cakes could have been better. To me there was really no flavor to them. . . After hanging out in the Fireside lounge we went over to grab something to eat for dinner. We got fettuccine Alfredo, shrimp scampi Acapulco, and pork loin and eggs. My boyfriend and I were very disappointed with our food. My shrimp scampi wasn't good at all. So bland.. . All in all, I don't think I'll ever come back for the food but definitely for drinks and appetizers.
Heard a lot about this place so we HAD to try it out last weekend. The lounge is SUPER KICK ass.. A MUST go to. The Grill is pretty cool to see.. however the food is just A-OK. More of a lunch meal. I HIGHLY recommend hitting the lounge late night after dinner for drinks/apps. The lounge is dark, good music, lots of TV's, sexy u shape couch's with plants/flowers separating the section all around you, a water feature with a fire pit in the middle. Pretty cool must see lounge.
Great portions for the price and totally shareable . Omelettes are awesome ! Good sIzed cups for coffee. Must try!
What a totally unique place. Night club style lounge with blacklight and firepit and the the restaurant itself had "cherry trees" inside. A little on the expensive side but it was worth it. Separate servers for cocktails and food.. . Place was packed at 10. Breakfast served all hours. We waited in the lounge for our name to be called and had a mimosa, which came in a huge glass with ice, more like a mimosa cocktail. It was really good! Wait for 2 was only about 15min.. . Had the ambrosia french toast. These photos don't do it justice. The plate was huge! Served with sour or whipped cream, both of which were very good. I wasonly able to eat half along with my side of eggs. My bf ordered a standard meal and asked for the bacon extra crispy but it came out almost undercooked...just the way I like it. He had another special request which was taken down but didn't happen but he was in love with their toast so that made it all better.
food is always good and hot... i like this place. this food almost tastes as good as mine... of course mine taste better but their's was second runner-up...    :) friendly staff. Open 24 seven.
Why do people like to go here? Maybe because they like Denny's and this is a better version that. The decor here has that 80's, dark, neon lights stuff - looks just like the inside of the limo that we were traveling in the night before. Good size portions are served, but the food were just whatever. I had the Ciabatta Pesto Burger and my friends all had various burgers and breakfast entrees and nothing stood out in terms of flavoring. Not worth the low double digit price tags for each. Guess the good thing is that they are open 24. For about the same price, Hash House A Go Go is a way better choice for even ridiculously huger portions and yummier tasting food with more of a distinctiveness.
They give you a nice portion of food. I had the chicken fried steak which was excellent. My husband had the Marco omelet, he said was good, and my son had a ham and cheese omelet, which he enjoyed. The service was ok, not the most attentive, but would I go back again yes! affordable, plentiful, and good tasting... works for us!!. . Would give 4 stars  but giving it 3 due to having to ask random staff for items, as lacked quality service from hostess.
This would have been my second time going to this place I thought it was alright the first time 8 years ago. Well this time it wasna horrible experience when my wife and I arrived it was jammed packed there was a 45 min wait.  So we were offered to sit in the lounge to have a drink and wait for a table. Well we walked in and it was dark and it looked like a sex den out of the 70's tables were dirty and there were questionable stains on the cloth lounges I was feeling a bit uncomfortable. So a waitress cleaned off our table and asked what we wanted to drink so my wife ordereda drink for us to share because it was a large drink and I hadnt ate yet. But the kicker was that the Peppermill has a no hat policy in their lounge? Strange I had a hat on it was a tastful hat nothing gang related or any of that cliche stuff, I was asked to remove my hat because they had problems in the past with people wearing hats strange? I refuse to remove my hat because not only I didnt see a sign stating it but i saw few indivduals in the same area wearing hats so I asked for management, management arrived and she stated that it was just there policy she could gove me a solid reason for the policy she proceeded to tell me about their lawyers came up with this policy odd? So I asked her if I had an open wound or religous wrap hat on my head I would be refused services or would be asked to leave there lounge at this point I was bother by the BS policy the manager offered to see if she could bump up our table wait so im able eat in their dining room with my hat but cant drink in their lounge what BS. I was uncomfortable about the whole thing and I left. This nearly cost my vacation to be ruined cause my wife wanted to eat there still at the Peppermill and i refused too because their double standard unexplainable rule.
Fast service and good food for the price.
This is a definite Vegas classic, never to be duplicated. Well, let's be honest. It should be against the law to duplicate it. One is enough for the world. . . The diner is standard yet with massive portions deli fare, with decent sandwiches and stuff like that. Pro tip: Get the multicolored sprinkles for your shake or dessert. I don't know why but they have them so indulge!. . The fireside lounge, on the other hand, is where it is at. Fake fire places, neon lights, velour couches, massive frozen drinks bigger than your head, and a cheesy ambiance beyond anything you could possible imagine truly define the scene. Check out the pictures if you must but instead, just go there and experience it for once. You may regret it but it is still worth it!
A bit pricey, but it decorated in retro 80s style with neon lights.  Excellent food, and service is top notch. Thanks yelp reviews for suggesting an excellent place.
Maybe they just had a bad day, but we got the worst service ever in the US.. . The waitress was spilling the soup, she didn't really care about the spoon getting all soupy.. . While sitting there an another waitress just spilled the food on a customer as well, so I think maybe the problem is with me, this is the totally normal way of business here.. . When I asked about dishes without meat, she replied by stating they dont have any vegetarian food, so I had to asked specifically whether they can make a chicken quesadilla without chicken and a ceasar salad witout meat. Of course they could but they didn't help at all choosing.. . When my friends asked for boneless chicken wings, they said of course they can make it, and they brought wings with bones. It was great nonetheless, but they could say that it is with bones.. . Most of the waitresses were bored as bloody hell, they didnt smile at all. Not all of them looked like they want to commit suicide right on the spot, but as I said most of them did.. . The portions were huge, and the food was tasty, so this is why I didn't give a 1 star.
I've been to the well talked about "pepper mill" twice now and it did not dissapoint. Both times w did not have to wait and had a great server. The food was good and although they seemed really busy, they were available when needed. I love that the coffee cups are real size and not the tiny single cups you get at other places. They also provide french vanilla creamer which is a big deal for me. . I ordered an omlette which was the best I've had in a while. It has a sundried tomato sauce on it which was delicious. One of the best things about this place is the piping hot blueberry muffin that you can order rather than toast. . . The ambiance is neat and kind of retro. I would eat here again while in Vegas. It's a great place if youre not looking for a buffet.
I'm always sceptical of restaurants with a legendary reputation.  In my experience, no celebrated eatery ever lives up to its hype.. . But Peppermill is not just a restaurant -- it's a taste bud energy field pulsating around the tongue and soul of Las Vegas.. . The food?  A Bellagio fountain of flavour.  The portions?  Bigger than Lake Mead.  The service?  DeNiro would blush.  The ambience?  A neon chic vibe that zipped me back to 1957.. . Peppermill is the ultimate Sin City jackpot.
Outstanding breakfast. You can swap fresh fruit for the hash browns.  They serve very good turkey sausage and my wife and i easily split a 10 egg omelette with no additional fee.  The food tastes very good and is actually quite a value when sharing a meal.
Sweet and simple from  a hotel and restaurant background. service from entry great and friendly staff great atmosphere and fast service and pretty good food . If ya want to sure a appetizers with a friend or even a army go with the Nachos!!
Favorite spot!  Good food and amazing lounge!
My boyfriend and I went there for breakfast and I had their pesto burger which was delicious. The lounge was nice and dark with a fire pit. You won't know if it was day or night in there.  I definitely recommend going there any time of day since its open 24/7.
Great food. Get in early to avoid long lines. (By Vegas standards, 8:30 am is early). . The serving size is huge. So don't order too much food. I canceled one order at the last minute after they made it and they were gracious enough to cancel it.
oh Peppermill, how I miss thee.. . The wife and I love going to the Peppermill when we're in Vegas.. The service is friendly, the ambiance is chill, the portions are ridiculously huge, and the drink menu has tons of options.. There can sometimes be a wait, but that's expected from a well known joint on the strip.. . . Can't wait to stop by here again next time I'm in Sin City.
Good spot.. . Came in late night (is 3 am late in Vegas?) alone and sat at the "bar". I ordered a chocolate milkshake and it was delicious.. . Wanted to write a review so I could mention the wonderful service I received, but since it was a month ago I completely forget her name. If management is reading this, she was 18-19 years old, just started college for dental school (she wanted to be a dentist).. She was probably the nicest server I've had in LV. Hopefully she reads this and gets a pat on the back (and a bonus).
If you are in or going to Vegas, this is a hidden gem. Great food only exceeded by the portion size. Had probably the best spicy Bloody Mary that wasn't served on the Chesapeake bay. Ordered Chicken fried steak and eggs. Absolutely the best that I didn't make myself. . .  We went there twice during our 4 day stay .Enough said. PS If you go on a Sunday-GO EARLY. The lines can get long.
Came here again and I still love this place. This is where I come to be a fatass after a long night of drinking. . . Awesome service, never a long wait for a table or food, and food is awesome and portions is more then enough.
Awesome spot. This is where we go to breakfast every morning when we're in town. The maserati omelet is the best. They serve a lot of food. My wife and I are able to split a plate and still full. The pancakes are worth a shot too.
Went here about a month ago.. Atmosphere Is like you're living on the set of the golden girls which I absolutely love! The food was great I had the eggs Benedict probably the best eggs Benedict I have had in a while. . The only thing that I have to complain about is the wait it took for us to be seated... Have no fear they have a full bar and fire pit to keep you entertained while you wait... James the bartender was AMAZING!!!!! He had great recommendations and was up for the challenge of being our bartender!!!! Overall, this was a great place and I will definitely be back!
Its right next to Denny's so Im Just sayin...if you want better diner food come here to.... Get a order of Chicken Nachos and a beer  to stop that hangover chief.
Food is alright, not bad for a dennys variant. But service....I get better service at McDonald's.
History, tradition, star power, kitschy vibe, massive portions, big strong drinks and decent prices......what's not to like?
Cheap frozen food  .. Salads drenched or no dressing at all Portions are Humongous ... After I ordered the Peppermill Sampler Huge Onion rings gross frozen chicken tenders and shrimp and Mozzerela sticks.  My friend got the Chicken Parmasean and sent it back my other friend got the chicken Caesar salad and it was gross as well.  I ordered a Bloody Mary I love Bloody Marys but theirs is Horrid GreyGoose or not.
First stop from the airport was the Peppermill! We had an hour wait but new it was worth it!. We sat in the fireside lounge and had a couple of beverages. The Bloody Mary's are the best in town!!. We finally got in and enjoyed the "Western Fruit Plate", banana bread and marshmallow creme sauce. The fruit plate is our favorite but we also added a waffle. BIG AND FLUFFY!!. Service is always exceptional and we rested and planned our day with the buz of happy vegas vistors telling their stories of woes and greatness...I LOVE THIS PLACE!!
nice classic diner.  good food
Heard a lot of good things about this place. Great Vegas ambiance. Prices were kinda high ($9.50 for oatmeal) but portions are huge!  24hr menu has something for everyone. Staff was very attentive. Excellent coffee.
We loved the juicy, flavorful pastrami burger with onion rings so much that we went back a second time on our 5 day trip to Vegas.  The only reason I downgraded them a star was because my hubby ordered a Mai Tai and what he got was nothing like a Mai Tai.  We still drank it but we were disappointed.  Other than that, a very solid and fun Vegas dining experience.
