Nice hotel but nothing special. The room was average size & surprisingly no cigarette smell in the room! I don't like their location on the strip so I probably wouldn't stay here again unless I got an amazing deal. I would recommend the hotel with the only drawback being location at the end of the strip.
We recently stayed here meeting up with family for a long weekend.  It was a great place to stay because it did have quite a few things for kids to do.  The adults enjoyed gambling and the pool while the kids rode the roller coaster and hit up the arcade.  We also liked having great restaurants right there as well as a Starbucks.  Our only complaint was the bathroom which could be updated and have a fan.  We also had some issues with our TV but they did give us a discount because of that.  Overall, I think we'd stay here again if we brought kids.  Otherwise we may stay somewhere more centrally located.
One of the best hotels on the street. Great rooms, great restaurants and great bars. I love to gamble here and when ever I get the chance I try and stay here. 5 stars all the way.
Strayed here many times. The cost goes up and the amenities go down. Still a fun place but used to be better. The piano bar sucks now and it used to be a place we would always go. Most dealers are not that friendly but they are the same in every casino now. Our favorite dealers was at NYNY but there was only one friendly one.
Rooms are clean and large and very reasonably priced. Good restaurants. Good access to points both North and South and a short ride to the airport. Walk over the bridge and through the MGM to get to the monorail. It is a long walk so don't wear silly shoes. The roller coaster is not loud and they shut it down at 11p and it is a fun ride. Internet access is not very fast or reliable.
The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. The casino is a casino there just taking your money.  . . Plenty of areas to check out within the hotel.....
The room was nice and clean and check was a at 11am which was nice. It's located at the end of the strip located right across from the MGM. I have been on the roller coaster awhile ago and remember it being really fun ( they offer pictures). . . The room seemed pretty plain, nothing really unique about them... Just standard. Everything was pretty cozy, the only thing that was the absolute worst was the television. It kept coming off to a weak signal and the screen would go blank. It was not just once, but we stayed 3 days and it was the whole time. It was really annoying when we would come back to want to relax and watch some television. Every time we gout into a show we would miss parts because it was off... It might had well of been off all together! It would be a 4 if it weren't for the TV.
Me and my partner stay'd here for are one year Anniversary the standard Park Ave. Room was clean and very nice looking. Currently a Mlife member we had a little problem when I checked-In the front desk didn't know I had a $50 Food & Beverage credit so it took a while to check in. On the day we checked out my partner mentioned to me that if you don't use the whole $50 food and beverage credit that they will take your $20 resort credit off. So we walked over to the Mlife Player card location the lady there told us that we needed to over to the front-desk to have them remove are $20 resort credit I'm not sure why the Mlife person couldn't just do it for us because I told her that I booked the room with them she wasn't that helpful. The food at the American Restaurant for breakfast  pancakes were tasteless and dry.
I love vegas and the strip always has something fun to do. I found New York New York to be exactly what i need on my stay but nothing more. I got a great deal for a four night stay and thought i would book it. The hotel did mess up part of my reservation but they fixed that asap and were very apologetic. We had free beverage credits which i used at one of the bars in the centre of the hotel. The bar tender was extremely rude and the bar wasn't even busy, but he was rude to the ppl next to me as well so maybe he was having a bad night or even year, i could care less. . . Each hotel in vegas has its unique flair but found myself spending more time in other hotels rather than my own. There was also construction work being done on the hotel facade and restaurants outside which was disappointing. My room was pretty good everything seemed updated and i had a good view of the strip. I like to play poker in vegas and was disappointed when i found out new york new york does nit have a poker room. The roller coaster outside was fun but no discount of tickets even if you are staying at the hotel. . . I did not eat at any of the restaurants at the hotel so i cant comment on the food. But there was some cool live music over the weekend. Overall the room was cheap and had everything i really wanted. The hotel is located toward the south end of the strip and is a bit of a walk to get to some of the larger hotels but you do get to see a lot of eccentric people on the way!
The casino part is super cool, along with the decor and zumanity. Nine fine Irishmen is a super fun pub with love music. The actually hotel part, not so great. The pool has been closed for 3 days, and not 20 minutes ago we went to pick up our bag from the bell desk (leaving today), and after we noticed pool is finally open (either that or they have weird hours)!!! AND, then, they wouldn't let us in with our bag!!!! I told the attendant we've waited 15 min to put our bag up this morning, another to get it so we aren't going to go through it again. So upset after three days we could t relax there for the remaining 30 minuteS we have left in this hotel. After not getting the requested single bed (got a 2 doubles, no availability to switch which I thought was a joke), and the bathroom was totally run down with a shower head that stung like millions of needles, my husband and I will visit the casino but we won't be staying at the hotel ever again.
This place is great!!! We came here for Spring Break and really enjoyed our stay, and did not have a problem while we were here.. . You exit the highway and you make a left to enter the New York New York. If you miss the left, you can go right up to the light at Las Vegas Blvd and make a left, turn left again into the Monte Carlo lot and make another left at the 1st stop sign. It sounds more confusing than it is.. . Anyways, I wasn't sure how the parking would be since the parking structure wasn't very big in comparison to the hotel and it was spring break. We had no problem finding a spot, and I recommend that you park on the 3rd floor of the garage so that you can go directly into the casino/hotel w/out having to hassle w/ a lot of elevators.. . Once inside it was very lovely, and had a pleasant odor. It's pretty straightforward to get to the registration desk...my only gripe was that you had to take an escalator to get down to that level, we did not see an elevator nearby. The line was really long since I got there right at check in time, but it moved super quick. The girl at the desk was very sweet and was able to answer any questions that I had. She asked me if I had a players card, I said no and she was very polite about it and did not try to pressure me in to signing up for one. I asked if it would be possible to have 2 beds (I booked on a 3rd party site and bedding was guaranteed above 1 bed) and that's what I got.. . Our room was in the Century A, up onthe 19th floor. The only thing I wish the girl at check-in would have done was explain the elevators better. There are 6 elevators in the Century set, but 2 of them you cant take if you are on floors 19 and under. I realized after that the elevators are marked above, but at the time I did not see that sign.. . The elevators are SUPER SUPER FAST!!! We were on the 19th floor and I thought it would be a pain waiting for the elevators and then the ride would be slow, but I was wrong. I dont really care to ride in an elevator, and I will always prefer the stairs over one, but these zoom up and down. I used my timer on one ride, and it took less than 27 sec to get from the ground floor up to the 19th w/ a stop at the 18th floor.. . We got to our room...after walking around corner after corner after corner and ended up almost to the end of the hotel. We arrived in our room and it was one of the cleanest rooms. The beds were made very nice, the bathroom was clean and everything was in working order. My only gripe is that they only provided one tube each of shampoo and conditioner, as well as one tiny bar of soap. And the toilet paper that was on the roll was 3/4 used. I don't mind that so much, but I would like a whole new roll for my stay in addition.. . Our room had a nice little view of the pool and of the rollercoaster. I wasnt sure about how I would feel about the coaster, since I read in previous reviews that it was a source of noise, but we didnt have any problems. We actually enjoyed looking out the window as the coaster would zoom by. . . The sucky thing is that the pool closes EARLY, like around 5-6pm. My kids were bummed cause they wanted to go swimming, but we didnt get a chance to try it out cause we didnt want to waste the day exploring Vegas.. . We really enjoyed our stay here, and would def go back. The facilities and rooms are very clean and the employees we encountered are friendly and helpful.
We didn't stay at New York-New York but we came to the dueling piano bar after our late flight into town.  We ended up getting a table and quick service all night which was exactly what we wanted.  . . The piano guys do a good job of engaging the crowd and we had a blast on our first night in town.  We've come here every trip and I'm sure we'll be there again.  Check it out.
I am at this casino right now and my boyfriend just picked up $50 on a blackjack table and the dealer had the nerve to say "thanks for being generous" when he didn't receive a tip. We were at the table for 5 mins TOPS. Such a classless comment. We cashed out immediately and took our money elsewhere!!!
Location location location... Other than that they're much better hotels to stay at on the strip for the money.. . The best thing to do is wait and go during the week... You can get some pretty good rates per night. Less than $100. I would not stand the weekend when you're paying the hundred and 50 to 200 for these rooms
After a rocky start this AM when someone came into our room at 6:45 AM the assistant Front Desk manager, Robert S, a customer service superstar upgraded us to a bigger better suite in response and sincerely apologized - we had a stellar day at the pool and then at the Blackjack tables! . Starting to love New York New York Las . Vegas again.
This based solely on the food and attractions here, not on the rooms.. . So, I've had the NY pizza here and those were pretty good and authentic.  There also was a fish and chips bar there that was also REALLy good and worth every penny.. . the rollercoaster is def worth it.  While it's pricey, it's a lot of fun and gives you great views of the strip.
