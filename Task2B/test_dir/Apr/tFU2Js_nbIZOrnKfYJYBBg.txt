Full disclosure -- my comments are colored because of the thirty minute wait we had for a table that we had reserved six weeks earlier...and here, in customer-friendly Las Vegas, nobody at the restaurant offered to buy us a drink, an appetizer, a dessert...no action other than repeated (and snarky) apologies as though we should be privileged to wait for a table at their establishment.. . The menu is high end bistro and loos excellent.  Food was good but not outstanding; our party enjoyed their salads but my short ribs -- a special -- were overcooked.  Wine list was, predictably for a Vegas restaurant at this price point, very nice if marked up obscenely (but one knows what one is getting in to).. . All in, rate it "fine" with a black mark for the late table and the smugness of it...at this price point I'd have expected "excellent," and not just "fine."
Atmosphere here is terrific!! For a local its like a little get away from the norm. The food is delicious and the service is perfect!! Fresh baked pastries every morning. A must try!!
Came here for Sunday brunch and expected the wait to be really long, but Vegas was so dead we only waited 15 mins for a table. We decided to eat here because of all the good things yelpers had to say.. . I ordered the chicken & waffles. Yum! The waffles had bacon in it, chicken was good, nothing special. The gravy for the chicken was what made it good. As for the waffles, vanilla bean butter and maple syrup... Ahhh heaven! My fiance took a bite of my chicken and thought it was kinda dry.. . He ordered the American breakfast: bacon, eggs, sausage, brioche toast, choice of a breakfast pastry & coffee. All for $22. I think that's awesome considering everything else was so pricey in Vegas. . . The food was good, but I don't think we would come back here for brunch. Oh and it's very hard to find, you have to take the elevator next to the check in desk to the 10th floor.
I love this place. I rave about it to my friends and really anyone who will listen. I don't normally order chicken and waffles, but my waitress recommended it, so I gave it a try. Amazing. So full of life and flavor. They brine it for 18 hours and roast it. It is served with a Chaucer sauce (correct spelling?) which to me is basically the most tasty gravy I have ever had. The waffle is a sourdough (though not overly so) waffle with bacon and chives in it served with vanilla butter. Very light and fluffy. I enjoyed it so much I came back the next morning to have it. I tried to order it a third morning, but it was Monday and alas they only serve this piece of perfection on the weekend. The coffee is also a standout here. My wife said the pastry she order was really good as well. The service was on point every visit and the decor was tastefully done without being overbearing. Another plus, they kept space between tables so as not to leave you feeling bunched in. Not the case at a few other restaurants we tried. I pay to eat cattle, not be treated like 'em.
On our last trip to Las Vegas, we decided to finally give this place a try. I had read and heard amazing things about Bouchon for brunch. Being a Sunday morning, I figure we would be waiting a good amount of time to be seated but the wait was bearable, only 10 minutes. . . This place is pretty big and has plenty of wonderful lighting coming from outside with some windows having the view of the Venetian gardens. During our wait we decided to go roam around and check out the beautiful pool and hot tubs in this area.. . FOOD:. *French toast $12- I love that this french toast wasn't like your typical french toast slices. This stack is bread pudding style with some sweet apples layered in it along with some custard. The french toast was soft with just the right amount of sweetness.. . . *Pastry Basket $13-Beignet, apple crisp, almond and chocolate and muffin. The beignet was alright (I've had better.. ahem disneyland ahem). It was a little on the tougher side rather than being soft and fluffy. The apple crisp was good but it didn't blow me a way. I wish it was a bit sweeter. The muffin was probably one of the bestest muffins I've ever had haha. The almond and chocolate pastry though, amazing!! Totally loved it. The roasted almonds, just enough chocolate hints in the delicious pastry to make me swoon. . . *Coffee: not as bold as I would like it but it was refilled a good amount of times by our server. . . Would love to go back and try out their omelette or maybe even their croque madame which is a grilled ham, egg and cheese sandwich. . . The reason why I deducted a star was the service. Although our server was on top of our order, I felt like they were a bit distant and not as friendly as I would think they should be during our brunch, she was extra nice to the table next to us though which made me feel like she didn't value us as much. Would this hold me back from coming here again? No. I would totally love to come back and get some more bread love in me.
Ridiculously good. Had the pate, lamb, escargot, pork belly (to share of course--I don't have THAT big an appetite.). The lamb was tender and mildly flavored. The pate was amazingly creamy and perfect spread on their fresh bread. I would have preferred the pork belly skin to be a little crispier, but the meat itself was flavorful and melt in your mouth tender with just enough fat to get that fantastically porky mouthfeel. Oh and the escargot... I had dreams about that escargot... Each escargot came to the table swimming in its private garlic butter jacuzzi, and was topped off with a crisp phyllo wafer that was perfect for dunking into that garlicky butter ambrosia.  . . (Sigh.... Scuse me while I wipe the drool off my phone) . . Pricey but worth it.  I'll definitely try the other menu options when I go back.
Went in for brunch. Delicious food. We ordered the raspberry and standard beignets. A must order! . . Main courses included the chicken and waffles and the steak frites. The chicken was moist and came with a well seasoned gravy. The waffles were a delicious blend of sweet and savory. . . The steak was perfectly cooked and the frites were great! . . Service left a bit to be desired, but the food was excellent! Great brunch place on the Strip.
On our last trip to Las Vegas we read some reviews about Bouchon and decided to give it a shot. Without question there food is phenomenal. Everything we had was cooked to perfection. A welcomed shortcoming was how heavy the food sits in you belly afterwards. They render everything in fat and obviously use a lot of butter. That is in no way a knock. It's what you have to expect from a French restaurant, and it is delicious. . . Having had such a nice experience the first time, we decided to go back on our current trip to LV. This time it was quite comical going to Bouchon. It was roughly 9pm. We asked to sit at the bar, however, we had our infant and were told infants cannot be up at the bar. That was totally understandable. . . We sat at a high top just in front of the bar. We were pretty excited to eat here again. Our server, Kim was very nice and asked if she could move is to a lower table in order to accommodate our child. It wasn't a big deal to us to sit at a high top, but it felt like it would be more comfortable for our server to move. . . This is the hilarious part. There were several open tables throughout the restaurant. I even took pictures to note how many were open. However, instead of being taken to a table, the restaurant took a silverware linen and laid it flat on a small table. Guess where this small table was? They created us a table in the waiting room of the restaurant. LMAO!!!!! We couldn't believe it!!!! They actually brought glasses and silverware to create a table to resemble a table within the restaurant. However, as I said, instead of a table cloth we had a silver wear linen as our table cloth. Hahaha. . . If it wasn't so funny to us that they sat us in the waiting room I would have been embarrassed to have been sat there. As people left the restaurant they stared at us like lowly peddlers. Oh well, it has been to date the most unprofessional thing a restaurant has ever done to us, but it was funny. . . Five stars would be inline because the food is just so good. I was the only one to eat because we had earlier had dinner at another restaurant, but I ended up sacrificing the majority of my meal to my growing 10 month old. At Bouchon I ordered the duck confit and a side of sauteed spinach. Yum and yum. . . It's the kind of flavor that makes you close your eyes and take in all the flavor. If I was a beaver I would store the good in my cheeks so I could ration all that flavor in my mouth for a month. I wish I could describe it with the breath of a snobby food critic to do it justice. I suppose it's only fitting that the guy sat in the holding room writes to all the minions. . . As always, we recommend Bouchon. It's very good. Perhaps next time we will have a table setup in the restroom so as to be able to fill our own water glasses when we require more water. Bon a petit dude!
A few friends and I recently took a trip to Vegas. The only place my boyfriend NEEDED to go to was Bouchon, as he is obsessed with Thomas Keller. Someday we are going to make a trip to California specifically for French Laundry... But anyway! . . We had brunch here and it was beyond phenomenal. We started off with the mussels and words cannot describe them. We thought we ordered the dozen but instead we were brought the larger portion and it's a good thing they did because we sucked them down. All together we ordered the steak frites, chicken and waffles, croque madame, and gravlax. I don't like salmon at all and I LOVED the gravlax. The croque madam was ok hot but got sort of unbearable when it cooled. I wish I would have got something else bit oh well. Other than that everything was great! It was one of my friend's birthday so at the end if the meal they brought her a complimentary Lemon tart of some kind. WOW!!!  . . The service was amazing as well. We never went without water or drinks, and they were so stealthy. To this day my friends and I reminisce about how much food we got and how good it was.
We visited here on April 17, 2014 again. Overall, a very good experience once more, except that the hostess at the entrance is not qualified to greet and seat the guests. When we arrived, having a reservation, she told us to wait. Then came several other guests and she engaged them in conversation and asked whether they wanted indoor or outdoor seating, totally ignoring us as other guests arrived. I then took exception to this and was finally escorted to a table but certainly not graciously. Our waiter came and started to apologize for the "misunderstanding" as he put it. . Otherwise, the service was outstanding, as was the food. A highly recommended restaurant, which needs a new hostess.
Wow....... Hands down the best Foie Gras i've ever tasted!!. . My duck dish was soso..too salty and the scallop was perfectly cooked... Great selection of french wine to choose from... great atmosphere.
Bouchon, a Thomas Keller restaurant, was central to our getaway weekend plan in Las Vegas. We made reservations several days before our trip and when we arrived we were lucky to snag a table on the patio near the fountain and nestled between the towering hotel wings.. . We ordered a cheese plate to start along with a couple of glasses of wine. . . It was one of those unplanned stirring moments. The nice weather, stars, lighted fountain coupled with great wine, great cheese and great company is a sweet moment in life. We took our time and enjoyed the evening.. . Next course was the special. I had the slow braised lamb shank. It may have been the best piece of meat that I have ever had. The sauce was nothing short of incredible and the lamb easily pulled off the bone with a fork. Have I already said incredible? well... it was.. . If that wasn't enough, we ordered a special dessert that was a fresh berry cobbler. Again, it was over the top and like everything else that evening, it gave you that feeling that you were getting a real treat made from the best ingredients prepared by high caliber chefs.. . This is the sort of place that excels in every category. Atmosphere, Service, Wine and most importantly the meal.. . It was a soft and slow evening that I won't soon forget.. . I can't wait to return.
I was so impressed with this "stellar Kellar" joint that I have dreams about it! I dined alone while my friends went to the shows. Just the mere mention of "boudon noir" sent the staff to find an accommodation for my request from the next weeks special directly to my table! Never have I felt so close to Paris without actually being there. Thank you, Bouchon, for taking dining to the place I feared we had lost.
We've eaten before at Bouchon and were very happy, so we were looking forward to another great meal.  Didn't happen.  Firstly, we had to wait about 20 minutes, even though we had reservations.  . . We were seated, and ordered cocktails.  They brought out the bread and butter and water.  The waiter came and took our order for apps, dinner and the wine we wanted with dinner.  After a bit of a wait a server brought out a dish with a small ramekin of something and pieces of toast.  Since we couldn't hear what the server said (it is noisy in there), we wondered if it was my husband's first course.  And if so, why did they not bring out my salad with it?  . . Then two glasses of wine appeared.  Still no cocktails.  We asked about the dish the server brought and were told it was pate, an amuse bouche.  A crock of pate with toast is not an amuse bouche.  It is rich and filling, not a light, two bite amuse bouche.  We asked again about the cocktails and asked that the wine be removed and served with dinner.  It was white wine and we didn't want it warm by the time dinner came around, especially when we were still hoping the cocktails would show up.  . . Then a server brought the first course,  a bleu cheese salad and an Alsatian tart.  The tart did not look like what we had envisioned, so my husband asked about it, and the server said, "you know, the PIZZA."  :O  So really, it was flatbread.  Tasty enough, but nothing special.  My salad was fine, there were a lot of bleu cheese chunks in it, but it wasn't really good bleu cheese.  Not the good stuff.  Please Bouchon...give me less bleu cheese but let it be creamy and flavorful.  . . The waiter came by, we asked again about the cocktails.  They finally appeared after the first course and just before the entree.  Fine, whatever.  Dinner came, along with the wine.  My dinner was great, moules, fresh, sweet with a lovely sauce, and *that is the only reason this is not a two star review*.  My husband's choucroute was ok, the meat was an odd texture but tasted good, the cabbage was very bland. . . I passed on dessert and had some of my husband's blueberry tart.  It was a tart on a plate.  Tart, plate.  It was dense, bland, and not much blueberry flavor.  But the presentation was sooo lacking...what about some creme anglaise swirled on the plate, topped with the tart and some fresh blueberries and mint, or some little, tiny bit of effort? . . While our waiter seemed pleasant and capable, the timing and the service was off, and it was offputting. There were long intervals between courses.  The food was uneven.  . . It seems like Bouchon is not trying anymore.  . . It was $180 for the two of us, so I feel they were well rewarded for their lackadaisical service and so-so food.  I really hope that they are not just resting on their laurels, but that's how it seemed to me.  Maybe we will give them another chance, but since there are so many dining alternatives in Las Vegas, we probably won't.
You cannot beat the out of this world bread and warm pistachios served right off.  And the french onion soup is dynamite.  Couldn't eat there without trying the Croque Madame which was fantastic and a steak frites, also delicious.  If you a french fry fan, then you'll love it!  I've never seen so many fries piled so high on a plate.  We were celebrating two birthdays and the lemon tart and creme brulee they served were stellar.  Great dinner!
I am very shocked that the food fell short of what I would typically call amazing. I am wondering if we just went on an off day. Whatever the case, I wasn't impressed with what we ordered. . . We arrived on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. They said the wait would possibly be 45 minutes but to keep checking back. We checked back by 10 minutes and they were already ready to seat us, that's quick! . . The menu wasn't expansive. Seems like a few items but done well and at a high price point - this place isn't cheap. . . Let's talk about what we ordered:. . Croque Madame - the brioche bread was so dry and almost burnt, the egg was over cooked - or too small, either way there wasn't a good amount of yolk. The bechamel was bland and lifeless also they didn't give enough to offset the dry bread. I was having a hard time cutting it and swallowing. It's unfortunate that I've had better. 1/5. . Plate of bacon - there were probably 8 slices of bacon. Of the 8, only 2 were crispy - The rest were soggy. We didn't even finish them. 1/5. . Side of Brioche - the brioche was definitely burnt. I wanted to send them back, but decided not to because I was too lazy. 1/5. . The complimentary fresh baked baguette was good and tasted great with blackberry jam and butter. The homemade blackberry jam was wonderful. Not too sweet and had a great blackberry flavor. 5/5. . Orange juice - it wasn't fresh. Bottled OJ at a price that they charged is so wrong. 1/5. . I am still pretty shocked that I was expecting a better meal but I ended up with a bland and dry one. I am hoping the next time I shell out that much cash, I will speak up and get something else that I may be able to appreciate.
