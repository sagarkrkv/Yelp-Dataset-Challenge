Within 60 minutes of eating at the Aria Buffet two members of our dinning party came down with food poisoning. we ate dinner at 6:00 PM and had only had plain bagels for breakfast that morning. Both members of our party were ill for the remainder of the trip and stayed in their hotel rooms. When we called early  the next morning to ask if others had become ill we were told nobody had called and they served over 2,000 people and there was no way we became ill from eating there. We don't know if others called after we did. But seemed odd that the "manager" could be sure that we did not get sick from eating there. He told me to call security and file a report. I asked him what good that would do my wife and he said he did not know but that was what we needed to do. No apology, no empathy. Keep in mind we paid $75 (per couple) for this meal and one would expect better than this.. . As a result we will never set foot in another MGM property again. The situation was handled poorly.
This is absolutely not a quality buffet. First off, food quality was very bad. Most of the food items were too dry or either too salty. Second, there was a limited selection. Yeah they had seafood, Mexican, Asian, etc. but selection was still very very limited compared to other hotel buffets in the surrounding area. Save yourself some time and money and goto Bacchanal buffet in Caesars Palace or Mandalay Bay.
This is one of the best buffets on the strip.  We come here whenever we can casue of the crab legs they are always delicious and fresh and you can get them hot or cold, and they have tons of seafood options from shrip and oysters to king crab legs to snow crab legs and the list goes on.. . The rest of the buffet is supper good and the drinks they have there are good as well especially the bottomless beet and whie type thing is a good deal if your going to be there for a hour or two.. . Can't wait to go back for the crab legs ...yum
I just drove home from Vegas and wanted to give my review of Aria's buffet. We used a 2 for 1 comp here, so this made the whole experience a bit easier all around. Knowing we did not spend $35 each helped us not feel cheated. We did purchase the $12.99 all you can drink sangria, wine, and beer. I stayed with the weak Sangria as I did not want to get drunk, I wanted to enjoy the food. . . I should have opted for drunk as the food was not good . There were stews (Chinese), stews (Indian) and more stews (fish, shellfish); boring, ugly and lazy for a buffet. Why have a tandoor if you are not going to cook nan to order? The nan was cold, and crisp and no one was there, at any time, to cook some up fresh. (And it appeared and tasted like the tandoori chicken was NOT cooked in the tandoor...perhaps baked?!) Sushi was stale and sloppy looking. Clams gritty. Cold prawn pasty and muddy tasting. Crab...well it was so small it was not worth the effort. Most certainly the cheapest they could find. Prime rib: flavorless (but at least there was both cream and grated horseradish). Sure there were lots of roasted meats offered on the carving stations so for some, this is a big plus, I am sure. . . Other than the flirty gentleman serving ice cream everyone there seemed angry and short. No one smiled, no one was pleasant. Our waitress scored a big tip because she at least kept the sangria coming, but even she seemed ready to go home (we got there at 8:15pm for a buffet that closes at 10pm). We tried to leave with a glass of sangria, and the woman at the front almost jumped down our throats and told us we needed to drink it there. ( I have half a mind to say "Fine, but you know what, we were told at 9:50 it was the last we could get as the bar was closing yet the "rules" of the unlimited says two hours. So I will sit here, and BTW, I have another 25 minutes I could be drinking." Mind you. we were being rushed out of the place because they were closing. yet this abrupt woman was telling us to sit and drink it. I felt sorry for those customers who were rushing to get food and did not seem happy about the closing of the buffet before being able to enjoy it. If you want everyone out at 10...then don't close at 10!!!) . . Back to the sangria. We pounded it and then promptly went back to our hotel which was NOT the Aria. If I cannot take a glass of sangria I paid for,(and was being rush, in my seat, to finish before 10pm) to the casino floor to gamble, then I leave.  Bad move Aria, you lost my evening gambling money. . . Can I say anything good about this buffet? Nope!
Had a comp for 2 dinners thanks to my Vegas on Facebook. I had high hopes because its Aria...what a major let down. Even at no out out of pocket cost other than tip, this place sucked. We got there fairly early for dinner and I was excited for a free yummy meal.....major disappointment. The pizza looked like it had sat out all day and when they finally put out a fresh one, the crust was limp and not cooked through. The brisket was dry and all the food I tried was under seasoned. Ate at the bellagio buffet the night before an hour before closing and was worried the food would not be fresh...not the case...the best buffet food I've ever had....skip Aria and hit up Bellagio instead. You won't regret it.
Thank goodness this lunch buffett was free for me, because the service and food was terrible. Small glass of soda and I only got 1 refill when my glass set empty for quite some time. It was not busy in my servers area, so no excuses.. Food was not very good and was surprised that they had peel and eat shrimp for the prices they charged, and not shrimp already peeled. Crab legs for lunch but no tools to crack them. Not very many stations with different food being offered as other buffets. Asian gentleman at the dessert station was not friendly and does not need to be in a customer service role
NEWLY RENOVATED Buffet at Aria. For those who have eaten here in the past, Let's me tell you The Buffet at Aria has undergone a huge overhaul of its old buffet and it now looks better and fresher than before to try and compete with Wicked Spoon and most of all The Bacchanal Buffet. From what I read online, they spent nearly 3.5 millions to makeover their old buffet.. . Here's a Full Steady HD Tour of the Newly Renovated  "The Buffet" at Aria that I recorded over the past weekend. or just go on youtube and type " Newly Renovated Buffet at Aria.". . or click on the YouTube link below to watch my video that I recorded of the buffet. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYpILdqTXyI. . The video was recorded during the dinner rush. . . It costs 40 bucks for dinner. . . This is the only buffet I believe to have Alaskan King Crab legs on the Strip. Even Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace doesn't have King Crab Legs. They have a varieties of Sushi rolls to choose from. They even serve jumbo shrimp that I don't see at other buffets on the strip.. . They even have a cool rotating Ice Cream Bar.. . Overall, I have to say this Newly Renovated Buffet is definitely up to par with Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal Buffet.. . Like I said above, If you guys want to see how the newly renovated buffet looks like I have recorded a HD video of the newly makeover Buffet at Aria:. . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYpILdqTXyI
this is a regular buffet for us we like the variety here and the food is good and fresh and that the bathrooms are in the restaurant is a plus and don't have to go looking for it.
This is an over the top buffet. You can have anything from New Zealand razor clams to crawfish to tandoori to an omelette for your breakfast and it's about $20. . . I only had breakfast here a few days and though the service was inconsistent and the omelette bar was inconsistent. . . Fortunately, I never arrived when the insane linens were happening and I wish I could find a good quiet, breakfast spot in Vegas.
Not so bad ,however is not the best food. quality is good ,variety not so bad. For those who really enjoy sea food the selection is very good . I've been in almost every buffet in Las Vegas . And this is not the best . Although they have a bottom less wine for 12.99 . I've had better, not my taste. I guess the selection of food change over the years I was impressed with the pictures I saw but not anymore
Went here for lunch.  Everything took forever.  There were lots of tables but they don'tseat you right away.  The drink cups are so small and they don't refill  them right away.  Also they don't refill on the food either.  Lots of empty food trays.  There is one guy at the dessert area and they were completely out of dessert but he remain on the ice cream station not refilling any dessert.. . Update:  That night I had really bad food poisoning.  Ugh!!!
Always hit up this buffet when I'm in Vegas!! So many options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The whole buffet has been renovated which has made it even better. Not too many places on the strip where you can pile your plate up with crab legs and fancy deserts for 20 Buxx!
Quality went way down. Very sad. Looked forward to coming here but disappointed we wasted 38.00 in a Monday for "brunch"
What the hell, picky Yelpers! This isn't a 3-star buffet, it's better than that!. . The buffet is bright and every food station (and item) is clearly labeled. Our server Catalina was very nice, attentive, and she shouldn't be working at a buffet because she was really good.. . The food was tasty and they had 3 times the selection as Wicked Spoon. The Aria even had some sugar free and gluten free items.. . This place is better than the 3-star review.
Never again. We had two free vouchers so we went for lunch and I'm so glad that I didn't have to pay for this meal. They had seafood, Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and different meats as well as a variety of desserts.  We tried a little of almost everything and our tastebuds were bored at best.  . . I would not come back to this buffet unless it was free again.
I have been to the Aria buffet quite a few times.  I use my points from "myvegas" to get 2 for 1.  We like to go at lunchtime because its 25.00 for 2 people to eat with my discount.  My husband really enjoys the shrimp, and most of the seafood. I am a vegetarian and I love the cold salads, especially the one with brussel sprouts.  Everything is usually clearly marked, and kept at the right temperature.  I have not been disappointed.  I'm not sure I would pay double this amount for a lunch, but definitely worth the 2 for 1.  I also like the way it is categorized into different groupings such as "Mediterranean" "Italian" "tandoori" .  I think it is a well thought out, put together buffet.
Great food.. Plenty of options!. . Good service (although slow at times) . . Their sandwiches and Mac n cheese were my faves!. . For 23.99$ per person for lunch is a great deal!
