This place isn't upscale. It's fine, but the rooms and pool area desperately need a facelift. I would not pay full price to stay here. I'm not sure how Ceasar's gets away with calling this an upscale property when it doesn't come close to Planet Hollywood's basic rooms.. . However...location is great, and the fake Parisian boulevard is pretty cute.
There's a reason Paris rooms are generally priced much higher than other Harrah's properties (excepting Caesars). It's because Paris actually has redeeming qualities. Now, you won't find those qualities in the basic room, but, you will find them as soon as you get off the elevator.. . Paris has some of the most fun clubs and restaurants. In particular, the dueling piano bar is a win on any given night. Good selection here, and fun crowds, but get there early. Also, Mon Ami Gabi, the strip-front French chain restaurant, is phenomenal, but that's for a different review. Another part of Paris' allure is that addicting crepe stand right outside the buffet. Mother of god.. . Otherwise, Paris is a bit crammed because of all the attention it gets with visitors to the fake Eiffel Tower. The casino does not have a very winning flavor to it, although we did comfortably sit and play roulette one night for a good three hours and still finished inners. But I think that was more chance than a standard.. . The other gripe about Paris is how cramped the buffet is. It simply does not have that wide-open, spacious dining room like the others. It feels more like a mini, turnpike rest stop. The food is really good, but the price is way too high and it simply isn't comfortable to navigate.. . Overall, you're spending to stay here, and you're better off paying an additional $20-$30 a night to upgrade to a 4 or 5 star hotel with much better amenities.
First let me say I am a diamond player and that I never have to pay for my rooms so I cant give a review as far as if it is a good value to stay here but I can say that as far as everything else is concerned I love the Paris hotel. I visit Vegas about 3 times a year and this is my favorite out of the Caesars properties.. The rooms are clean and some I have stayed in have been really luxurious  some obviously need to be updated but for me the room is just place to crash between gambling and eating at all the great restaurants. I love how easy it is to navigate from the rooms to the casino and the layout is easy to pick up pretty quick. Try navigating the Venetian...I think my cousin is still lost in one of the hallways there!. The restaurants here are great. Mon ami gabi. sugar factory are great for breakfast, gorden Ramsey Steak, and the Eiffel Tower are awesome for dinner. The pizza place in hallway is great for late night snack.. My daughter had her wedding here and it was fabulous. (Don't go to the hair salon but that's a different review). Location on strip is great for me because I play at all the Caesars properties and they are all right there next door to Paris. You should book a room here and put up your clothes and go out and experience the city of sin and not worry about how old the tv is in your room!!
Pretty cool, rooms are nice, great service, and nice places to eat (little pricy but good). An overall great experience. Would definitely go again.
Meh... Is all I can say.  . . Pro's: . 1. Good location on the strip. 2. The gym membership is included in the daily fees... and is relatively well equipped. . . Con's: . 1. No full in length mirror in my room . 2. No coffee in the room. 3. The cobblestone floors in the hotel suck to walk on in heels.
Paris suffers the same plight of many strip casinos in that they are looking more than slightly dated. I did appreciate the short walk from the entrance to the elevators.  But that hardly makes up for horrible food at every restaurant we ate at and the hour and a half wait for a cold omelette and coffee from room service. I'm also sick of hotels charging $25/day to use a gym that rivals a holiday inn express at anytown USA.  We asked for a humidifier and were given some contraption that had a bowl of water with a fan on top of it. We would have been just as good if we filled a pot with water. We wanted to stay an extra night and were told that's fine but there is no way we could keep that room. "It is already filled by someone else". We begrudgingly packed and went downstairs only to get our same room back. A little frustrating.  I think I'm just tired of the hotels that seem to "vegasy". The ugly carpet, trashy waitresses and constant ringing of slot machines. Hopefully more places will adapt the Cosmo/aria style...
Stayed in the basic luxury king room and I have to say I was more than content.. . When we arrived they only had a 2 queen room available but told us to call first thing to change rooms. It was quick and easy and they kept us on the same floor as our party. . . Our mini fridge wasn't getting cold when we called they came to check within the hour but said it was fine. But they sent us a larger fridge right away. We also had our privacy plaque up the entire time but housekeeping called everyday to make sure we didn't need towels or anything.. . All the staff we dealt with were friendly and helpful. The pool was nice, the room was more than sufficient and had a great time. The rooms are a little outdated but by no means not adequate. Would definitely stay again or recommend to a friend.. . Only bad thing, the water pressure in the shower sucks.
Here's my feedback - . Overpriced, rooms are outdated, was charged $40 to check in early, was charged $20 to receive a package and $30 service fee for the mail room to put it on the truck to be mailed - this was not the cost of the mailing - The only good thing were the employees. very friendly and helpful
I recently had a short mini vacation earlier this month. As a diamond TR holder we got treated like I think a diamond member should be treated. Aside, from always getting the basic rooms comped. Finally, got an outstanding suite/penthouse on our last visit Comped yay! Got the Picardy room which is more than enough space for a family of 5 but got moved to an even bigger and better room The Marsielle 5 toilets, 3 bathrooms, 2 oversize jacuzzi 2 bedrooms and a huge living and dining area . Amaze-balls!! I don't know if it was just pure luck that weekend cause i did good to on the slots ..heehee.. I just hope I get the same treatment for UFC fight week this July ..but doubt it cause it'll be a forth of July weekend but who knows .. Vegas always surprise me when we visit! 2nd home for sure
Just checked out this morning!. . We were in the red room and it was decent. Basic room, basic layout, basic bed, basic bathroom. Everything was typical hotel room. . . Pros: easy walk from check in to elevators. Close places to bring food back to room.. . Cons: weak shower pressure. Bad tv reception. . . I guess after that horrible room at the MGM I was so glad to have a bigger room, and a door on my bathroom. . . Would not mind staying here again.
We stayed at Paris in April for 7 nights.  The room and restaurants are great.  Prices are reasonable.  The housekeeping staff is wonderful, never had an issue.  On our 5th night we were dismayed that the guests in the room next to us were smoking an "illegal substance" and the aroma/smoke was coming into our room.  I've never had this problem in any other hotel stay and had to complain.  We explanined that we are drug tested by our employer and it was a problem.  It was 11 pm and the only solution they had was to move us!!  We had to pack up all of our belongings and relocate.  They wouldn't ask our neighbors to cease their behavior.  When we complained the next day about the inconvience the front desk told us to fill out a comment card.  I've never been so disregarded!!!!!
rooms need updating but great casino.
I loved min ami gabi.  The  ambience is beautiful the food was great and out lovely server was attentive.  But... The music that was playing was such a distraction.  It was rap.   It ruined an otherwise great brunch.  It was not a good fit for the French atmosphere.   It was. To even french rap.
We stayed in the Paris Luxury Suite and can I just say I was very impressed. We stepped off of the elevator into a semi-private (only 4 other doors) very elegant corridor with breath taking views..  We had a double door entrance that opened up to marble floors and Italian furnishings. The suite was about 900sq feet with a formal dining area, wet bar, powder room, whirlpool tub, private dressing area, separate bedroom and a bathroom with a bidet. There was a great view of the eiffel tower with the water show from the Bellagio Hotel in the background from the living and bedroom area. . . The hotel itself was reminiscent of Paris with quaint boutiques and restaurants. We hit Burger Brasserie for dinner, La Creperie for dessert and this cute little wine store for a bottle and took everything back to the room.. All in all we had a great time although I did find it difficult to walk on the cobble stone in my heels.
It was a serious disapointment.  I would either pay more for a better hotel or less for the same hotel.  My room was a standard double queen room, it smelled like smoke from the vents i guess, and randomly at night every hour, it sounded like someone was taking a 15 minute shower.  it sounded like we were by the ice machine, but we weren't, so I have no idea what this running water sound was.  i didnt complain to font desk, because thats just annoying both ways.  it just sucked.  anyway, if i expected this maybe i'd stay at flamingo instead for cheaper with same quality, or just go somewhere nice like venetian.
I have never met more rude pit bosses then I have at this place. Holy hell.. . We came over from Planet Hollywood because they told us this was their "sister" hotel and they had $10 tables or would open one up for our large group. The pit boss, whose name I can't remember-It was Lita or something like that refused to do so. Then there was a male pit boss who was pretty much making fun of us because we said there was $100 minimum table and no one was sitting at it. We told him it would make more sense for him to have 6 of us sitting there gambling at $10 then have it be empty. He said "what about that table? Do you want to gamble $100 a hand? If so, sit down. If not, sorry". I asked him if he was getting paid to be an asshole and left.. . Get it together.
