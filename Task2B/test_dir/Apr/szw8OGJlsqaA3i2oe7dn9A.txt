I think by the sheer number of different pastries, I can see why people get excited here.  Presentation is unmatched other dessert places on the strip.  But presentation is half the story.  Even though it is good, it doesn't leave me with that must come back attitude.  My group all order different cool looking pastries, so I had a chance to try a little of each.  Nothing to write home about.  Great photograph moments, but the taste is what will make me come back.  No home runs.  If I"m in the Aria and want a pastry, I would come back.  But I wouldn't go out of my way for it.  Go get a Red Velvet Cake at the Grand Lux or a Coconut Cream Pie at Carnegie Deli for a go out of my way dessert.
Coffee here was aiiite! about 3 bucks for a small cup.. . The macarons and lil dessert pieces were delicious! I recommend the hazelnut square.
The coffee was excellent but unfortunately the pastry I got was quite stale. It was a honey roll with pecans and was totally unacceptable for a reputedly good pastry shop. I won't be back.
On our most recent visit, my wife and I each ordered the mixed berry crepes which were topped with a generous scoop of whipped cream and a variety of fresh berries. The crepes were executed to perfection and delicious, but I believe these would have been even a notch better if I had remembered to order the souffle style like we did on our previous visit.
Delicious paninis! . . We tried a prosciutto/mozzarella and the tandoori chicken. The sandwiches could have been a tad lighter on sauce but overall had a good ratio of fillings to bread. The top layer of bread was crispy but the bottom was kind of soggy due to the heavy saucing.. . The desserts looked yummy but we were too stuffed. Maybe next time!
Based off the service alone, this would have gotten a one star, but thepastries are pretty stellar, so in order to do justice to that, I settled for a two. . . After a long night in Vegas (just walking, eating and watching a show - Jabawokeez rock!) we landed up at John Phillipes for a dessert around 12:15am. Note to Patisserie: I know it's late at night and even though you don't close until 2, you have run out of most of your pastries... but please, please take the signs out of the window for the ones that are missing! The longer I stood in line, (total 15 minutes), the more disappointed I got because of viewing the pasty item tags that weren't there that I was actually in the mood for! . . Anyway, we finally got to the man taking the orders and he just looked at us and grunted with a pen and pad in his hand. I stared back at him until he finally spoke and said in a rude tone, "know what you want yet?" (No, I have been waiting in line for 15 minutes staring at me feet the whole time. A little, "Hello. How can I help you?",  would have made all the difference - and by the way, when did we get off the plane in the east coast?) So I told him our Oder and I was debating on coffee, but before I could tell him, without asking if "that was all", he went on to the next person. I decided not to say anything and went to the cashier instead.. . No hello from her either, or smile. She looked like she wanted to commit suicide and that being there was the last place in the world that she wanted to be. My hubby ordered a bottled soda and I asked her politely for a glass of ice water. She never acknowledged me or my hubby and went to get our drinks. She wasn't the brightest crayon in the box, because she came back with a glass of ice. I looked at my hubby and he shrugged. So I took the glass of ice, figuring that he could use it for his not-that-cold soda and asked her again for a cup of ice with water. She looked at me like she was about to murder me, than turned around to get it. I was pretty pissed. It takes a lot for me not to say anything, but I decided against it.. . We got to our table with our desserts. The caramel chocolate thing was excellent, the fruit tart, not so much. I've had better at Portos Bakery in Los Angeles (my home). I would have returned here to try some other desserts later on, but won't, simply for the inadequacy of their employees. I don't excuse the lack of customer service for the late hour. I work for the airline as an agent. When you have a delayed flight with an original 10pm departure that's delayed and delayed, then finally cancels at 1am, passengers don't give a crap how tired you are and don't want your attitude. It's your job as a CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON to provide excellent customer service at all times. If you can't do that, get a different job.. . You know, Airline agents are rumored to be some of the most horrible customer service personnel ever (with the exclusion of myself). So Mr. John Phillipe, thanks for giving us a run for our money.
Yummy! I headed here straight from the airport for breakfast. Lines were busy, but moving. Excellent food and especially great dessert.
Tons of options!!!! Love it and what a great dessert display! Like the fact that they had a mini dessert sampler too! So delicious!!
This place is dessert heaven!! Seriously dangerous for people trying to watch their diet, like me! Everytime my bf and I stay at Aria, I always have to stop by here several times. Sometimes we grab lunch here, they offer pretty good sandwiches and pasta. I tried their tandoori chicken sandwich and lobster pasta. Pretty good! . . And of course for sweets, plenty of desserts to choose from. They also have a section specifically for crepes too. I ordered their berry crepe once and omg... Devoured that thing in less than a min. So delicious! . . It's always usually very crowded. Never really open seating. It's defInitely very  convenient esp if you're staying at Aria hotel. I'm addicted to this place!
