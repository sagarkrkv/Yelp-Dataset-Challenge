Ate here with my family. We did not like the food but,  we were at least charged a lot for it. Thanks.
I've been here a few  times while attending events for work and staying at the Aria next door. I like the beer selection and the bartenders are good. Beer prices are crazy though! Come on, $12 for a Palm? I do realize this is tourist country but so is where I live in Orlando and a Palm here is in the $5-6 range. Best time to go is during their happy hours when things are priced at "normal" levels (1/2 off). Food was consistently good but also overpriced. Almost $20 for their PUB Burger.  I will say I had my best beer ever here (The Abyss) when I went last year on a recommendation from the staff. Would be a solid 4 stars if not for the prices.
I am so disappointed with my recent lunch experience here. After passing by it on several trips to Vegas, I was dying to give this place a try, but I never seemed to have enough time to fit in in to my stay. This past weekend, however, I made it a point to finally try it out and I was so extremely disappointed. I wanted to love it, I thought I was going to love it, but it was actually one of the worst dining experiences I've had in an incredibly long time.. . We were seated right away at an outside table, which was nice. Our waiter immediately came over to take our drink order, which was also great, except we weren't ready to order. They have a pretty good beer selection so we needed another minute to think it over. That's when it all went down hill. Although he had seemed eager to get our order in when we first sat down, he then seemed to forget about us completely. We had long waits between waiter sightings, and often had to ask other waiters to find ours. He would halfheartedly apologize for a wait, but then disappear all over again, not to be seen until we found someone to track him down. It was crazy! There was a party of 6 sitting across from us, then a party of 4, then another party of 4... so 3 larger parties all came, ate, and left by the time we had gotten our food! We were just a party of 2.... . The food was on the pricier side for what it was, so I was expecting high quality. I ordered the sliders, and was disappointed when I tried them. They weren't bad, they just weren't good. They weren't juicy or flavorful as I had been expecting. I had just recently had some amazing beef sliders in AZ (for half the price) and these didn't even come close. I would say the food was average, and not worth the price tag. The service was beyond terrible. We did more work than our waiter did, having to flag people down and ask them to find him repeatedly. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience and I won't be going back.
A large group of us went for reverse happy hour. Most of us were pretty happy with our drinks and meals. I, however, being the only one that ordered oysters on the half shell was not. I had a dozen oysters and 8/12 had major shell/sand issues inside. I was so disappointed. Luckily I had split an order of sliders with a friend and was able to eat those instead.
This place was amazing. Would have been 5 stars, but their drinks were over-priced. I guess they feel they have a captive audience, but there are other pubs in Vegas. Service was excellent - both attentive and friendly. Servings were generous, especially on the apps there was enough for a group to share. Had the fried pickles and lobster roll - Delicious! I will definitely come back when next in Vegas.
The server was okay. My brother'a burger was over cooked. The fish in the fish & chips was good. Over priced for quality.
Loved the beer selection at TODD ENGLISH PUB. They have maybe 50 craft and rare imports on tap. But holy crap, way too Vegas expensive!!. . Green Flash Palate Wrecker, for example, was $14 for a tulip... . . Call me cheap, but that was too much. Even for Vegas.. . 2.5 stars
I only had the Happy Hour here, but it was great. Not actually great, but better than most of what you'll find in this over-priced town.. . Beers at half-price were about where they should have been, and the selection of craft brews was good and fresh. The chicken wings were $1 each and very meaty with a nice hot sauce. The dipping sauce and veggies were lacking, but the wings were good. The oysters were $2 each, which seems to be regular price, so no great deal. The shells broke off into the oysters a fair bit and the sauce was lacking flavour, but the oysters themselves were decent. If the food was supposed to be crafted by some celebrity chef, there was no mark of it. This was very typical pub food with no frills.. . Our server was very slow and seemed to approach each table with an apology for something or other. It was a nice day and we were seated on the patio, so I didn't mind waiting too much. Fortunately I knew what I wanted to drink since the server didn't seem to know much about the beer or wine.
Came in for happy hour (3p-6p). They have quite the extensive beer selection but we were feeling some sangria. Having eaten a huge lunch, I didn't even have food. However, they do have bar snack. I LOVE BAR SNACK. I know, it's silly, I enjoy the simple things. Just a little bit of seasoned popcorn wins me over. Being a local, this is not really an ideal location since its touristy and overpriced. The service was good, the sangria was tasty and hey... your check in gives you a free bud light. I may come back in to try the food.
Hmmm, where do I start? . . Food: expensive for what it is. We had the tuna burger, which was good, but not $24 good. We also had the lobster roll, low quality lobster drenched in creamy sauce, you can barely taste the lobster and the bread was dripping with grease. We also has the French toast which was made from the same bread as the lobster roll and was drenched in syrup. . . Beers/drinks: good selection of beers. I had the Belgium suggested with the lobster roll, it was good. Expensive, but can't complain here. . . Cocktails: we only tried one, the strawberry mojito, basically sugar water with pieces of strawberries, you can't taste the mint or fruit or most importantly any hint of alcohol. FAIL!. . Conclusion: come here for decent beers and a cool bar, for food and cocktails, go elsewhere.
We came here to grab a quick-ish dinner before heading out to a show.  Being a PUB type restaurant, even if it's in the Crystals, I thought it'd be just average all around, but was pleasantly surprised.. . When we arrived the hostess was apologetic and let us know that it might be a 5 minute wait for a sit down table, but it was nice she offered us a high table if we were in a hurry to get seated.  A couple minutes wait was all it took and we were seated.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive throughout our meal as were all the other who helped bring out our food.. . The food itself was pretty good.  Nothing to knock my socks off, but it was all well prepared and tasty.  The steak frites I got were both plentiful and delicious.. . If we're back in City Center I'd definitely stop back in to P.U.B for dinner or drinks.
I don't know why I like this place, because the service is rough and the prices are way too high on everything. But there is something to be said for a $9 draft beer. At least it tastes good. . While never being impressed, I still go back, so there must be something..
Decided to try this place after reading reviews. The service was horrible. Took forever to order food and they didn't even care to bring us utensils or plates. We ordered the crab cake sliders and the lobster rolls. The food wasn't good at all. The crab cake sliders tasted horrible and the lobster was too chewy. Avoid this place if you are looking for good food. The food is totally not worth the money.
Great food coupled with great draft beer -- can you ask for more?  St. B's 12 on tap -- are you kidding me?!  Wonderful service and great atmosphere.
Great pub. Right next to Aria so if you're staying there this place is ideal for a few pre-game pints. . . Lots of TVs. Huge crowd. Very lively place. Happy hour from 3-6 with half price pints (at least it is now on a Friday). . . I have heard comments about bad service but the folks helping us at the bar have been fantastic. Courtney is amazing. Short staffed and she's still covering the whole bar. . . Second time I've been here and both times this place didn't disappoint.
Excellent Brown Butter Lobster Rolls and Fish/Chips. Prompt service and wonderful food.
Wonderful service.  Hard to find in the mall.  The craft beer selection is excellent, but a bit more than market value.   The food ( sliders , Shepherds Pie and  potato chips ) were, well just pub food.  Pretty much on a par with most decent bars or so-called gastro pubs.   I thought a designer chef would be better.
My fiance and I decided to stop at this restaurant for a quick bite for dinner. After seeing the menu on the outside of the door, we were anxious to see if the food was as good as it sounded. . . On first approach, the hostess was extremely pleasant and very kind. She sat us immediately at a booth along the wall. Our waitress, I think her name was Hayleigh, came to our table to take our drink order and my fiance and I both ordered drinks from the bar. I ordered the white sangria and he ordered a Manhattan. Our drinks took approximately 20 minutes to come to the table and when the server brought them out to the table, she made an excuse about the bartender being new and walked away. This did not bother us much except for the fact that we probably would have ordered 2nd drinks if they had not taken so long! . Before she brought the drinks, the server asked if we were ready to order and seemed inconvenienced when I mentioned that we would like to order an appetizer. However, we ordered the mussels and they were really delicious. Our food came out before we were finished with the appetizer. I ordered the Lobster Rolls and my fiance ordered the RIbeye. My Lobster Rolls were delicious. i cannot express how much I loved them. Definitely a must try if you happen to want to try this place out. My fiance's ribeye was cooked well, however the potato wedges that came with it were cold and soggy. By this time, both of our waters have been empty for a good 15 minutes. Once we finally got our servers attention, she was annoyed when we explained to here that the wedges were cold.. During this time, the table in front of us was complaining to the manager about their food taking a long time, and the manager was a complete jerk about it to them. Both my fiance and I are servers and we have never witnessed worse customer service. The manager was rude and condescending and told the table that they were lying about their food taking a long time, and said "What do you want me to do about it?" . For this reason, we chose not to speak with the manager because of how rude we saw him being. We then asked our server, who we have seen only 3 times all night to box up our food, because we just wanted to leave. . . Worst service I have ever experienced. I will never go back. I cannot believe a place with this reputation allows their management to treat customers so badly. My fiance and I have friends who live in Las Vegas and we travel here at least once a year. With food that is this good, it is a shame to ruin it with such rude and negligent customer service.
