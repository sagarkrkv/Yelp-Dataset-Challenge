The bison burger is is absolutely delicious and the black and white shake is just short of addicting howeverthe bill will reach deep into your pocket book so it is definitely not an every day sorry of place
Whenever I go to Vegas, I eat at the Burger Bar because of their delicious burgers and exceptional salted caramel shake.  I am even more impressed with the staff and management of the Burger Bar because I hosted my wedding reception of 21 guests there last weekend. I made reservations over a month ago so we didn't have long to wait. They arranged tables through the center of the restaurant because they don't have a private room.The service was excellent (I think the server's name was Gina) and our food arrived quickly and perfectly prepared. Thank you Burger Bar!
Above average burger.  They do take the time to make it better.  Quality ingredients = a better burger.  I have eaten here twice and was happy both times.
What's not to like. Chef Hubert is incredibly talented.  All of hes restaurants don't disappoint.  The burger bar is no exception.  Always great creative new concepts. I love the sauces and Mayos.well done chef...
Really good burgers... Staff is great at the bar... at the tables they have been a little slow. The sliders were good for a snack. This is one of my go to places at mandalay bay.
My wife and I always hit of the Burger Bar when we find ourselves trapped in Las Vegas. Depending on the kind of burger you construct will seriously effect your dollar total. The burgers are pretty good and you can also choose from a variety of choice cuts (i.e. Kobe, Angus, Lamb, Buffalo, etc). Yes this is the place that has the $60 Kobe burger, and it's crazy good. Ladies, impress your man by taking him here one night and he'll think your the cat's pajamas.
Hey, this place was pretty good. Came during lunch on a Tuesday. Decent beer selection. Had a couple on tap. . . Created my own wagyu burger. Ordered it medium, probably came out medium rare but not really complaining. Tasty. Got a fried egg on top which I've done in the past but starting to think that style is too messy to really enjoy. Mostly I was consumed trying to sop up the yolk. Must be getting old.. . Got some fat fries, onion rings. All good. Service was good. Not really any complaints.
Great burger try the classic to start or build your own. Add the zucchini fries and try a Twinkie milkshake or one of their other great choices. Did I mention the awesome beer selection in the bottle and on tap as well?
Had lunch here with a friend.  Got the build your own burger with bacon and cheese and it was very good.  It is still just a burger but a very good burger.  Onion rings were fantastic, fries were very good.  Waitress very attentive, service a tad slow but all in all a good meal!
Always a great burger and service and beer list to die for.
I did not get the Sixty Dollar Burger because it is 60 bucks.   But I got the kobe burger ($17) and it was great.  My daughter got the sliders and they were a bit dry and over cooked.  The wedge salad is A-OK.. . I came for dinner on a Sunday night and we (4 people) were abel to find 4 open seats at the bar and didn't need to wait.
This place is LAME! First the burgers suck ass. I don't understand why it gets a high rating. I order the sliders, the crap was cold and my buns were rock hard. I've had a better burger at Denny's. Finally to top it off the waiter got upset with me because I gave him a shitty tip. Well if you give me shitty service, I'm going to give you a shitty tip jackass!
Needed pre-game food before hitting Marquee and since we were staying at Mandalay Bay, we had room credit for food & beverage. My bf & I decided to try out burger bar because of the great ratings, but was disappointed. . We got to the restaurant and placed our order there to bring back to the room. I decided to do a custom burger with just kobe beef patty on a ciabatta bun with lettuce tomato and red onions. Also got sweet potato fries 'cause what's a burger w/out fries?!. . Honestly, the fries were better than the burger. I remember finishing the whole box of sweet potato fries. They weren't too oily and were crispy. The burger was such a shame. Patty was overcooked and it's "Kobe" Sure didn't taste like kobe beef though. It was so dry and lacked the fatty flavor that I normally get from Kobe burgers at most restaurants. In addition, there were no juices coming out from the patty, that's how dry it was.. . Do yourself a favor and get a real burger at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR
The original and still best place to get a gourmet burger! For me it's all about the meat .. they cook the high quality Black Angus to where the juice is dripping out .. mmm ..if you like special toppings, they have everything you could ever dream of .. I my burgers on the ciabatta bun and the staff there is incredible friendly and helpful .. I go here so much they have all watched my daughter grow over last 2 years and know her name .. great place!
Very good though not excellent burger due to presentation and quality of the meat.  One of the best options for balance of cost and quality by the mandalay hotel
Called in to put our name down. It's located near the shops at Mandalay Bay, near Lush Beauty and a candy store. Be ready to stack up $$ on your burgers. . . FOOD:. Turkey burger (4 stars): Customized with wheat bread, fried egg, avocado, American cheese, and mushrooms. All burgers come with the standard lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle. Turkey was cooked well and was moist. . . Veggie patty (3.5 stars): A little dry but looked much better than any other turkey patty I've seen. . . Skinny and Fat Fries (4 stars): I usually love skinny fries but I liked the fat ones more here. Nice and crunchy. .  . Nutella Shake (5 stars): Do not come here when you are trying to eat healthy because this was the best thing that I had here. SO FREAKING GOOD. Well anything with nutella is always good, but this was extra good! . . Coke float(4 stars): Also really good (= They make good shakes. . . Service (5 stars). Our waitress was awesome. They mixed up a couple of fries on our order but fixed it right away. She kept up with all our requests, and for a group of 10 we had no problems. . . ATMOSPHERE (5 stars). Cool burger place. They have nice big booths to sit in also, with a small TV at the end. We had too big of a group to sit there though. . . The hostess girls in the front were fake nice. Almost made me not want to eat here. Sorry I asked how long the wait was girls, but we had 3 kids in our group and kids go crazy without food. All you were doing was standing in the front anyway!
This place is AWESOME! We ALWAYS come here when we visit Vegas! I always get the same burger (the Hangover Burger, which, I describe as a 'higher-end IN-N-OUT Burger). I also LOVE the salted caramel martini! . . The service is ALWAYS excellent and they are always friendly! . . I really can't say enough good things about this place. It's definitely worth a visit!
Lil pricey but that's the price to pay for excellence.  Look, you're on the strip and you're hungry.  Your Mrs. wants a salad, your friends want to try the latest celebrity chef spot and the guy that tagged along just wants to know what time we're getting to the club, strip club, concert, cirque show, etc.  Tell everyone to relax and just go to burger bar.  Its a local favorite stop prior to all things MBay/Luxor for a number of reasons.. 1. get the burger you want, built how you want it.. 2. nobody doesn't like hamburgers (even you veggies, pretty sure they have your options too). 3. milkshakes and those spicy cheese popper things because your inner fat kid deserves to be let loose from time to time.. 4. It's not JUST burgers, they've got plenty of other choices on the menu.. Excellence does take time and is a little pricey but in the end you'll have a satisfied bunch.  Then you can take your Mrs. to the cirque show, your friends will head to the concert and the creeper can catch a cab to the strip club.  Everybody wins.
I love the burgers at Burger Bar. You can tell that they use high quality of beef. The fries are top too. In general I like the bar, it's classy... A place like you find it in Europe. Good wines and beers as well.
Everything was good from the fries, wings, quesadillas, to the sliders. Even the coffee wasn't bad considering I needed 3 cups. I was expecting coffee that had been sitting brewed from yesterday (because who drinks coffee at a burger joint?!!). That's how bad I needed it but it was fresh and the service was great.
I try not to eat burgers too often but if I have a craving I will make a trip to Burger Bar. It is the best place for burgers in Vegas and probably anywhere I have been. The Kobe/Wagyu beef burger is my favorite. A good way to get it is on a potato bun, caramelized mushrooms/onions, swiss cheese & peppered bacon.  I highly recommend the zucchini fries as a side. . . If you have room for dessert the sundaes and milkshakes are great but the only time I have been able to try them is when i only eat half of my meal and take the other half to go.
Great Food and Excellent Service!!. I recently met a client who was staying at the Mandalay Bay, he suggested that we try Burger Bar as it was convenient and he had heard good things about it.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they grind their own meat, plus they have a lot of options like lamb, bison and grass fed beef burgers, and sweet potato fries.  I will definitely be going back soon!
Second time here and sooo awful. The sliders were bland and the fries weren't any better than Burger King. That's saying alot me thinks. And service at the bar was incredibly horrible. SO unfriendly, SO unhelpful, SO impersonal! We asked for the beer menu and were given dirty looks with our menu. What's up with that? I asked for one of the beers in the cold case from Dogfish Head - again the dirty looks and silence. I felt like I was in some sort of time warp here. Luckily the beer was cold, and I'd never pass up the Dogfish Head Raison d'etre. It's amazing. Skip the Burger Bar and go next door.
If a casino or hotel has one thing then everyone else has to have one too.  There are few better examples of this than burger restaurants, and some are much better than others.  If you find yourself at the south end of the strip, do yourself a favor and visit Burger Bar for your burger fix.. . Aside from the recommended options, Burger Bar offers guests the ability to customize their burger any way they see fit.  Bun choices, protein choices (even a salmon option), and toppings galore.  The fries and onion rings are pretty amazing as well.  I've been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed.  The prices are reasonable in normal places, and downright bargain-priced for the Strip.  I've dined here with a friend and we each got a burger, fries, and a beer for about $40 before tip.. . This place often gets crowded, with wait times in the hour range.  If you want to be seated fast, sit at the bar.  The wait is usually zero and the bartenders are extremely friendly and helpful.
This place was good although over a year ago when I went the unique options to customize your burger were awesome.  I can't remember which shake we had but a few of us customized them and they were bomb.  I added shrimp on my kobe burger and it was winning. I tried a few others but I think mine was the best out of the group I ate with.
Being this is Vegas and all prices are inflated (burgers start around $14 and go up quickly), it is easy to be skeptical. However, I was widely impressed by the burgers. . . The Spicy Lamb Burger was very good. It had a nice kick without being spicy just for the sake of being spicy. Definitely not a burger that will ruin your taste buds and throw you into a flop sweat. The Hubert Keller burger (made with Buffalo meat), was awesome. Carmelized onions and blue cheese, tough to go wrong there. My favorite, though, was the Peppercorn Burger. It had peppercorns (obviously) along with Dijon mustard and a peppercorn sauce. I usually skip the sauces or get them on the side as I fear they will be either overpowering or make the sandwich too messy. However this sauce was outstanding. I'm not a fan of creamy sauces and although the menu states it is a "peppercorn cream sauce," it was not at all what I expected. It was not a mayo-based sauce so not super thick. Tough to describe, but it was fabulous. Here's a great tip, get the zucchini fries rather than regular fries. They are awesome.. . I was very happy with the Burger Bar. Nice selection of beers as well.
The best Burger place in Vegas.  Hubert Keller truly provides an exceptional experience here.  Lots of premium toppings.  Go wild folks!!
