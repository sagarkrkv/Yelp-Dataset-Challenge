When I went, they were renovating their front part of the hotel so it was a mess. Hotel itself is good but not great. They have a mall-like food court with subway, chinese food and etc. Casino floor was good but also not that great. I would go again because their rate is great but the food and overall it's just good, not great.
We had a Monaco Suite. Expected a little better for the money. Furniture could use replacing. Toilet in main bath wasn't working properly. And never could get Wi-Fi. Had issues with the front desk upon check-in too. Casino was nice and lobby was beautiful. Housekeeping was very good. Buffet was expensive, but very good. Great location on the strip.  Probably wouldn't stay there again unless it was at the Hotel 32.
Love this place! Nice rooms, great views. This was the first time we have stayed here and will stay again for sure. Not overpriced for what you get. We were very surprised at the quality for the price. Staff is great. . . Casino is nice and honestly pretty quiet compared to the rest. The bars in the casino are nice and pretty much around the same price as other places. Most have great happy hour prices on food and drinks. . . Restaurants are all pretty good but, The Pub is amazing and is great for watching sports! Also has great food and a great happy hour setup! Diablo's Cantina is on the corner of the resort and we go there every time we go to Vegas so, obviously it's great as well.  . . They have a nice walkway that has some good shops and a tram that takes you from MC to Aria to Bellagio. . . Only complaint I have is the WiFi is pretty much only the first two floors (that's what the sign says) Which won't  bother most people since they're not in the room much anyways. But, for the cyber junkies it wouldn't be very good I guess. I was fine with it coming and going from our room. We were on the 22nd floor so we didn't expect super great WiFi anyways. . . Keep up the great work and I'm sure we will see you again soon!!
Not luxurious like it was before when it was new but with that said the management at Monte Carlo have done a good job of keeping this place in good shape. The casino is clean and lively, sports book is solid, the wave pool and pool area in general was good, and the food court is solid. Our rooms were simple but clean. They need to add wifi and more electrical outlets and USB ports for the rooms. Overall we had a good experience.
Meh is how I felt.I maybe have too high of standards but with a name like Monte Carlo (and the pics they post!) I thought I would be more blown away.. . Checking in was easy enough. Staff was super friendly. The casino had a really good choice of games as well. And the best part....Starbucks right downstairs! . . As far as room. Was very dated. I don't like that they don't have the bathroom seperated (sink outside of toliet/shower part) like most are these days. Walls PAPER thin. I thought are toliet was still running but the person next door was showering..very LOUD. . . The hotel did not have as grand of a feel as I was hoping for. In fairness though, I did get a pretty good price though. Too many other nice hotels to stay here again though, IMO
Monte Carlo is an old, reliable friend. We've stayed here on three separate occasions spanning eight years. As far as Strip themes go, you're not going to find much of it here. Monte Carlo is built quite simply as a moderately priced, classy hotel. Depending on your timing, it is possible to land a stay here for a very friendly price. . . Two things stand out to me whenever someone mentions the Monte Carlo: . . 1) The pool. We really enjoy the pool mostly because of the lazy river. It's very relaxing, and the poolside music is among the least annoying of places we've stayed.. . 2) The casino. Very friendly confines and it's never difficult to sit/play wherever you want. . . Monte Carlo also has easy access out back to the neighboring casinos, so you don't have to sardine yourself down the Boulevard to get where you want to go. Anytime I'm heading to Vegas, Monte Carlo is in my top three choices for rates in the initial search. She's never let us down.
Definitely the best bang for the buck, easy location to major strip sights, conveniently to malls and foodcourt.  Interesting pools, spacious casinos, friendly staff abound! Whether you've got kids or seniors or a group on a guy/gals getaway, this is the one resort in Vegas where I really felt all were welcomed!  I've stayed at Wynn, mandalay, venetian, mgm, flamingo, bellagio and this is my fav mid price resort.  Go to the wynn if you want to splurge but be prepared for the inconvenience of WALKING/WAITING to get anywhere.. . Pros: Love the variety of pools, lazy river has current and wave pool makes a dip quite fun!. . Elevators are SO close to everything, if you got kids, are senior or just plain lazy like me, food, pool, casino and exits are all within 50 feet from the elevator.  Wish more resorts were laid out with this convenience in mind.. . Rooms were standard for the $100 price range, what do you expect?. . Cons: The resort fee has got to go!  Marriott tried it and had to end it!
I've stayed at several hotels on the strip and this hotel isn't a great value.  Paid $130/night for the deluxe guestroom on the 15th floor which is not the cheapest price I saw compared to other hotels but I thought it was going to be a better quality hotel so I booked it.  I was wrong.  There is NO WIFI and we could hardly get any service on our phones in the room which made things very difficult as we were trying to research shows and restaurants to go to.  There is an ethernet cable that you can hook to your laptop which is an amenity included in your resort fee.  Wish I would have known that but I have never stayed in a hotel that doesn't offer free wifi so I didn't even think about it.  The hotel room was pretty dated.  I was kind of disappointed walking into the room after looking at the photos posted on travelocity's website.  At any time of day the check-in line was lengthy, even on Monday as we were checking out, the check-in line was just as long as it was on Saturday.  Some people were getting frustrated because they had 2 people working the check-ins.. . Pros:. . Location:  Not quite at the end of the strip.  I've stayed at the luxor which is at the very very end of the strip so it was nice not to have to walk as far.. Tram:  There is a tram that takes you to the Bellagio.  And it's FREE!  Just ask the staff about it or look for the signs.  There is also one across the street at the MGM.. Blue Man Group:  Affordable show to see and also convenient since it's located in the hotel.  We bought our tix from the "Tix4tonight" booth across the street for $68 each. . *Tip for seeing shows:  Check living social or groupon for deals... saw some awesome deals on there after purchasing our blue man group tix.. . Cons:. No Wifi. No Mini-Fridge. No dvd-player. Average looking lobby. No food or drinks allowed in pool (probably the same at all hotel pools) which means you have to wait in the huge line to order drinks. Smells like sewage outside. . Will not be staying here again unless there is an Awesome deal going on.
The rates are good but in serious need of room upgrades! We got the spa suite and it was pretty gross. It smelled like mildew and there was mold in the shower. Didn't get in the tub because the jets looked really dirty. The carpet is gross. Wallpaper was peeling off everywhere. We ended up changing rooms from the spa suite to a reg room because I couldn't handle the mildew smell. Doesn't look like the pictures at all! We also couldn't check in until 5! When check in is 3 and check out is 11. That was very annoying. The customer service sucked at the front desk as well. Won't be back here
Pros: I love the atmosphere here! They offer my favorite game and dealers here. Dealers are all very friendly. Everytime I come visit Vegas. I make a effort to stop by here for the day to gamble and even maybe a have a few drinks.. . . Cons: I used to stay at this hotel all the time because of how much I have enjoyed gambling down stairs. Especially with all the great dealers. But over the years I started noticing the hotel rooms are pretty out dated. Tiles in the restrooms are falling off and/or missing. I can see lots of mold around the shower doors. Hotel Rooms smell. I love this casino but They need to start renovating there hotel rooms.
We have been visiting Vegas for years and had never stayed here until this last time. .Check in was easy. Our room was not ready *we arrived early* so that was no problem. Once we got our room...I was pleasantly surprised. We had a spa suite on floor #26 and it was very nice. Loved the big spa type bath tub and the water jets. We gambled a bit..didn't win but had a blast anyway. I will most definitely stay here again.
Horrible! Everything about this hotel is BaD! I hated the food, the rooms were disgusting! The service? Forget it, they have no service, but price? Well ya, it's affordable! I guess that's why we get what we pay for!. . The casino was alright, I did win a little bit!. Will I go back? no! I rather stay at motel 6!
Central location on the strip with standard hotel rooms. Not too bad but nothing special about it either.
Checked into the Monte Carlo tonight, I haven't been this disappointed in a long time. We are suppose to stay here for 3 night's , but we will be checking out tomorrow.  I'd leave tonight but we are exhausted from a long day of traveling.  The place is a dump, carpets are stained, wallpaper peeling off the wall, cracked tiles in the bathroom.  We have an HD TV without HD service. I asked for a fridge in my room, they want $25 a day for it. The Luxor is cheaper and a way nicer hotel. Stay away from this place.
