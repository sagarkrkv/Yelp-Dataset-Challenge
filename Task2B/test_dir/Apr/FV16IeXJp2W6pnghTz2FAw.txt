LOVE this place! They have fantastic noodles (combination beef [#13] is my favorite), spring rolls/peanut sauce are addictive and you MUST have the Ong Choy sauteed with garlic cloves (#75). Sometimes they can go a little heavy on the sauces with their Chinese dishes, but just asked for easy sauce. Service is friendly, open 24/7 (BONUS!!) and their honeydew boba is SO good. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try. I promise you'll make it a regular stop.
I guess because it's open late they're getting decent reviews, but on the quality of food it's no better than any other Pho restaurant down in Chinatown.. . The broth was overly salty and for the price you're paying you're not getting a big bowl of pho.  Quantity is not just what I'm looking for, but you have to make up somewhere when quality is lacking.  Even in a Pho Dac Biet there was no tripe to be found.  How can that be?!  It's a staple.. . A good place to go if you want to order a plethora of other non-Vietnamese type dishes, but if you're looking for a good bowl of pho, look elsewhere.
Be very careful with your bill!!! Check it and check your change! Three times consecutively I have come here grabbing pick up delivery after work and the same guy always seems to " accidentally " add something to my order and " accidentally " short me $1 from my change... Really?? Mind you I'm coming to the restaurant at 3-4am... I have a feeling he can get away w/ this since most people eating at this time are drunk or w/large group of people. A dollar here, a dollar there.. That adds up. I feel like he's trying to tip himself..
Late night hunger at The Palms Casino and I turned to YELP. Punched in 24 hour restaurants and Pho KIm Long popped up. Pho sounded good and my gf agreed.. . It was around 3am and this place was busy! Got seated right away and took some time to read the menu. I decided on #13 special with beef. My gf had the chicken pho.. . The #13 was very tasty and filling, probably the best pho I've had so far. The spring rolls were good, nothing spectacular. . . We will be back.
I guess after the rapid growth of business, Pho Kim Long starts having some issue on their QC and customer service. Last time me and my girl went there, we found a cock roach in the soup and told the server about it. And guess what? He came check out the bug body and then took it away. Then he claimed that it was just some pepper they used to make soup and left a check then walked away. I can't believe this is how they treat their customer.
This place has some seriously good Pho and I just get vegetables in mine. But the broth is deep and flavorful, the veggies are steamed to perfection with some crunch left in them and the additions (bean sprout, thai basil, lime, hot sauce etc) make the place my happy place. I've brought lots of friends and everyone has become addicted- in fact, I refer to it as crack soup because eating it only leave me wanting more. Thank god there's enough in a large bowl for 3 meals!
1 star for being open 24 hours.. . Worst customer service ever. The guy that seated us gave us attitude and was plain rude. The pho was bland and wasn't worth the wait or the rude service.  No one ever came to check on us to refill our water glasses. Definitely will never go back.
Open all night, I ordered charbroiled pork chop and steamed rice. Delicious.
I've only ever had take out chicken pad Thai however every time I've been greeted at the door with a smile almost immediately. My order was place quickly and even on a busy Friday night my order was ready in approximately ten minutes. Even in a styrofoam take out container, it's delicious! Large portions make 2-3 meals too! . Would highly recommend giving them a shot!
I will say this , initially me and my companion came 2 nights before and left because we got very bad service. In fact , we were sat down and people who were seated after us were served before us (and I'd love to know why). But we decided to come back and had a great time. I look forward to eating here again , and maybe next time able to give a higher rating. On holiday from Phoenix Arizona. My companion found this place on a foodie blog. We had spring rolls for an appetizer. Then combo dinner rice , with shrimp and beef , and a chicken platter.
Best rice plates in vegas. Affordable and open 24/7! Everything on the menu is good! Can't go wrong with this place!
I had #16 pho, really enjoyed it. I opted for the large (which is $1 more than the menu price) and had enough leftovers to take home for a huge lunch tomorrow. The portions are great and the prices are very reasonable!. . If you're expecting super friendly service from the waitstaff, you might be disappointed. Personally, I don't need to know my server's name (or need them checking on me every two seconds) to enjoy a great meal.. . The waitstaff is efficient, the food is prepared quickly, and though the restaurant was packed on a Friday night we had to wait less than ten minutes to get a table.
We got the #15 rare steak &brisket and an order of spring rolls and egg rolls and #14 rare steak. . The pho is so tasty and they give you a pretty big portion. Make sure to ask for the hot chili oil from the waiter, it's so tasty. . The egg rolls were so good we had to do a 2nd order. . If you're in Vegas then you should def stop by
I admit, everytime I drove down Spring Mountain Rd. or passed the big billboard for Pho Kim Long, I would just bust out laughing. Just because of the name, I had to try this place out. Best thing is, I was hungry late at night and this joint is open 24 hours!. . Upon entering, it's in a regular old strip mall. There's enough parking fronting the restaurant. I didn't have many high expectations of this place. The seating reminded me of a traditional Chinese restaurant with round tables, rather than a Vietnamese restaurant.. . Service was ok, but not overly friendly. I got the shrimp banh xeo for the appetizer, which is a shrimp fried pancake with mint, lettuce and other conidments to wrap it in. Delicious, crispy but not too oily.. . I ordered the pho tai nam. I love their broth. Very rich, piping hot and tasty. Noodles were cooked well and not too hard or soggy. Plenty of condiments from the sweet basil, beans sprouts, garlic chili oil sauce, etc.  I would say the best broths I've tasted ever. Beats any broth in Hawaii hands down. . . I loved the food. Food came out fast. Service wasn't that friendly, but hey, if you are efficient and fast, I'm okay with that. Love that it's 24 hours and wished we had something like this in Hawaii.
Pho review. Be prepared to put your name on the waiting list. The hostess was rude. This place is packed so it better be amazing right? Also voted #1 pho in Las Vegas. So, we took our chance and waited for almost an hour. I'm only reviewing their pho. It was nothing spectacular. On a Sunday afternoon after a night of partying on the strip, their pho did it's job. One of my biggest pet peeves is when lemon wedged are served on the side with pho. Who does that?! No doubt, it should always always always be lime wedges!! Service was good. The other menu items looked good at the table next to us. However, we only had their pho. Make sure to stop by Lee's Sandwiches for the best Bahn Mi. It's only a few doors down in the same mall area.
This place is always packed! I guess that's a good sign that the food is good, but not so good when you are hungry!!!! Quic Tip: If it's packed, and you don't want to wait for a table, you can order your food to go, it's faster! Also you can even call ahead and they can have your order ready for you by the time you get there. Oh and if you are planning to go there on Sunday for dinner, be prepared to wait!  I always recommend this place to out of town friends who are looking for after hours grub, especially after drinking... and they never fail to impress. I think that they are a little bit pricey for a vietnamese restaurant, and the customer service could be a bit better on some days, especially when packed... but overall, i still like going here. My fave dishes are the grilled pork chop, salted fish fried rice, calamari and wonton noodle soup.
Food is fast, staff is okay. Love that it's 24 hours but they're always in a rush to get you in and out.
Worst customer service in existence!   It's kinda funny to see this in this day and age.   But,  if of don't mind the attitude the food is good.
Came here on a Sunday afternoon and was intimidated by the large crowd waiting outside. My friends said that they just HAD to have Pho and that this place was worth the wait so I angrily agreed.. . Went to get iced coffee from the Lee's Sandwiches next door, picked up some bread from a nearby bakery, and then we were called to sit down. To my surprise, the wait was only around 20 minutes.. . After placing our order, the drinks and food came out almost instantly; as in, everything we ordered was on the table within 5 minutes. I have never had my food come out that fast, but the hangry beast inside of me did not have time to question why or to be skeptical. . . I ordered Pho Tai and egg rolls. They both were delicious and quite satisfying. After adding lemon to my Pho Tai, the broth was flavored perfectly to my liking.. . The prices are reasonable, the service is lacking but adequate - what you would expect from a very crowded Pho place, but the food comes out quickly and tastes great. I will be back if I ever am in Vegas and in dire need of a good Pho restaurant.
i was the first time came to Las Vegas,I was so hugely when I arrived this resturant,I feel bad when I arrived,bad service,late food and bad food,I don't want to came again.
