Ok, since I slammed WHISKEY PETE's for their HORRIBLE SERVICE, time to get on the bandwagon and name one of the oddest yet best experiences we've had in a LONG TIME!. Treasure Island is the best!  Here's a summary of our experience with their service for my wife's birthday getaway!. First off, the bad stuff..... We checked in early afternoon on Friday.  When we got to the check-in desk we were greeted with a "Sorry, your room you booked over a month ago isn't available".  Oh no, here we go again, just like the other place, right?  WRONG!. It seems that a "Guest of the Hotel" had our room and so it wasn't available.  I get it, but then I don't.  Guess we're not the high-rollers or friends of someone who knows someone else, so we get put down, right?  WRONG AGAIN!. Yeah, it took well over 30 minutes for our check-in lady to figure it out.  (not her fault that the present tenants decided to stay longer)  She tried everything.  We both heard her on the phone passing room numbers around over the phone.  She really tried.  Then, without us asking, she contacted the service manager.  This took a couple of conversations between the two and a few more tries at the computer, and a few more minutes of us standing there waiting for our world to come crashing down,.... AGAIN!. But lo-and-behold, they finally came up with a solution!  We had booked a suite, and they gave us an executive suite.  Now ain't that sweet!. But wait, there's more!  If you book now, you get a free bottle of Champagne on the house!  (Yeah, that's what free means, but I'm"m on a roll!).  We were also handed a few coupons for deals they had for eateries around the property.  They were good ones, too! Not just some "Save-a-buck" coupons, but "real stuff!".  . We were elated!  Could be because we got almost $100 taken off our bill, (I'd rather not say how or why, don't want to get them into trouble of any sort), maybe because they really gave it a try, maybe it's because of the courtesy we were shown.  . Now we don't expect people to bow down and lick our boots just because we're a customer, but we do expect folks to honor the fact that we booked over a month ago and would like compensation for our time and money.. It isn't their fault the tenant decided to stay overtime.  But they made up for it, and we got moved "up" to a bigger and better room.. GREAT FOLKS!  GREAT PROPERTY!. My buddy was reassured that he'd have a wonderful time there too, and was told how to make a reservation and what to ask for, specifically.  This was a totally different scenario not related to this write-up, but the folks are great!. So, KUDOS to CHRISTOPHER the manager, and Connie, the lady who helped us out!. We WILL BE GOING BACK, and RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO EVERYONE, not only because of the location and the way it's set up, but for the fantastic people that bend over backward and do double-flips to ensure your stay is a good one!. (Guess I'd better stop now, huh?). Did I say this place is THE GREATEST!?
Awesome place to stay. Get a suite if you can. Jacuzzi tub and separate bathrooms, soft mattresses,  very roomy. The coffee shop is the bomb though a little pricey, buffet is good and they give you a 2 for 1 if your a guest. The hotel is in a great location and walking distance to the popular properties. Have stayed here for years now and have not been dissapointed.
March 2014...Stayed at the TI in Vegas for 2 nights. Was in town for a convention, not just for a carefree time.. The room was clean and well stocked. . . First... I went to flip on the light in bathroom and cut my finger on the switch plate. The hard plastic was broken into pieces and the pieces had been fitted back into the switch plate cover. I dislodged them when I cut my finger, proceeded to stop the bleeding, collected all the pieces, wrapped them neatly in a tissue and took them to the front desk in the morning. The manager was unimpressed with my situation and said that someone would go up to look into it. When I arrived back in my room for the evening, my switch plate was still missing pieces.  It was not fixed during my stay.. . Next... There is this little, sliding mechanism that opens and closes the window about an inch. This thing would not stay closed,  It was WINDY outside and I love the sound of the wind, but it sounded like a wind tunnel. This was not my only gripe.. . Finally... I have stupid food allergies and something on their approved list made me super sick. I only ate at their establishment while in Vegas because I was so afraid of eating anywhere else and getting sick. Oh well...  On a plus side... their staff was so helpful in trying to find me safe foods, I really really appreciate their efforts. The kind lady in the salad area of the buffet was wonderful and very helpful.. . I'm really sad to leave a 2 star for them and will return again... not to be critical, but to enjoy the time that I know TI is worthy of providing.
Tried staying in at Treasure Island because it wasn't too far from all the clubs my crew and I wanted to party at. Turns out, it was a nicer hotel than we thought! It's not as expensive as Bellagio or Venetian but more pricey than the Stratosphere. Checking in was easy but checking out was a little wait.. . We had such an amazing room with such an amazing view. We somehow were given a room on the 36th floor, the same floor with pent houses and the only floor you need to use your room card or else the elevator won't take you up there. That was pretty neat. The room itself was so sophisticated and the decor made me want to take notes for a future master bedroom idea haha!. . Stayed two nights. On Friday and Saturday the total was around $300!! Yikes. Totally worth it though in my opinion!!
I was here in 2013 and it was for a bachelor party.  At that point it was great.  Lots of booze, a pool, and a casino.  We really didn't need more than that.. . In 2014 I came with my wife and I came and stayed here.  We check in, we are informed that they didn't have the king bed we booked three months ago.  So we got a room with two queens.  I initially put my stuff on one of the beds and it just sank.  The springs in the mattress were well past their prime.  So we went to the other bed, it was fine.. . Then my wife goes to take a shower.  She asks me to call the front desk and ask for a new shower head.  I ask her why and she tells me because we didn't have one.  Really?!?! someone stole the shower head from the room and the hotel didn't realize it and replace it before we get there.. . They fixed the issue, but it shouldn't have occured in the first place
It is a pretty nice hotel, didnt check out the pool area on our trip casue it wasnt open even though it was 80 degrees out in October.  Hard to find parking though especially at night but when we got into the hotel and wnt to check in and we had reserved a king size bed and in a non smoking they had already rented the room out so we got stuck in a smoking  two queen size beds voerlooking the boat show. The room wsa prety nice the beds just ok.  They said the next day they would move us into the room we reserved but since we were only going to be there one more day really didnt see the point in repacking and moving to another room just for one more night... did go down later that night after going to dinner and played on the slots and won pretty good and the food options are just ok nothing special but location is pretty good .  Will probably stay here again just hope next time we dont have the same problem at check in.
Nice hotel that is starting to feel a little old school. I stayed her back in the 1990's and it was hip. Today I feel it's starting age a little. Still all in all it's a great place to stay.
I've been to Vegas over 10 times now, but TI was the first place I've ever stayed, and it will remain one of my favorites.  The rooms are decent size, clean, and well decorated.  The casino is also very nice.  Staff is top notch and has a decent selection of restaurants and bars.
Pretty hotel, very big connects to the Venetian and the Fashion show shopping mall. I loved our room, it was classy looking and had a nice view of the Vegas Strip. Everything was pretty clean and there was a lot of convenience near us. . . A few gripes - the hotel casino & lobby were scented which is not cool for people who suffer with allergies to scented things. . . It seems our maids stole some change from us that hubby left on the table, glad we didn't leave anything super valuable out. . . Definitely one of the cheaper places to stay on the strip, just beware if you suffer allergies the lobby is pretty strongly scented, and don't leave ANYTHING out while you are not in your room because the maids here can't seem to be trusted.
I went as a group and over all, the experience was good. . Fact that hotel is located very close to Fashion Show Mall, most of the people loved it.  Of course, there is a outlet and many fine retail stores are all over the strip.   One that I want to make comment is that, we were placed near the lower floors.  5th and 6th.  My room was on the 5th floor and even with the windows closed, I could hear a Air Condition Cooling tower's fan.  I am pretty picky about the noise.  So, I went down and asked them if I can get the room changed. The respond that I got was,  Flat out NO, reason being is that, because I came in as GROUP, the bell service already has the room assignment and they cannot accommodate the room change.   . The fact that the lady on the back of the counter didn't even try to change the room and didn't show any concern about the noise just made me angry.   I wasn't asking to change all the rooms, but just 1 ROOM out of 15 rooms that I reserved for my group. . I would rate the Communication between the Group Sales Coordinators a Rate 5 Stars. . Hotel as 4 Stars. Lady Behind Counter  (Manager at the time on 04/11/2014 at 3 pm )as only 2 Stars. . Which I think the over all hotel as 3 stars.  . I hope everyone understands that CUSTOMER SERVICE should come before anything else to earn your future business.
I love this hotel.  Centered in the middle of the strip.  Next to fashion show mall.  Smells incredible!!  No cigarette smoke in the air. No bad views.  Quiet on floors.
1st appearance,  hotel looked okay. Upon further review, most of the electrical outlets were covered and the surge protector appeared fried..yet they left it in the room. Customer service seriously lacking (all departments). Don't waste your $$$ at this dump.
My friends & I booked our stay here expecting an ok hotel. We were very surprised to see how nice it was! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We were even given a room facing the strip that we did not pay extra for. The room was very nice and clean. . . The food in the restaurants was not great. I'd go somewhere else for that. . . Definitely would stay here again!
Since my first trip in July 2008, I've been to Vegas 11 different times now.  TI will always be one of my favorites, mainly because this is the first hotel I stayed at while in Vegas.. . CHECK-IN/FRONT DESK - 4 Stars. Overall the front desk staff is very friendly and the check-in process is quite quick.  They have one large queue line that zig zags throughout the check-in/lobby area, which I like better than the individual lines for each front desk clerk that some hotels have.  For some reason it makes things go quicker, and you won't see someone further back in the line next to you check-in before you.. . HOTEL ROOM - 4 Stars. The rooms I've stayed in before seemed very clean, modern, warm and welcoming.  The standard rooms also come with a decent sized LCD (plasma?) TV, safe, ironing board, desk, and a nice sitting chair by the window.. . CASINO - 3 Stars. I do like to gamble at TI now and then, but for some reason the theme/decor of the casino itself does not call out to me.  I preferably would like to play next door at The Mirage or down the street at Harrah's or Bally's.  The casino staff is nice and friendly though, and always willing to help you brush up on your skills at the game, or learn the game if you're a new player.. . DINING - 4 Stars. TI offers a wide assortment of dining.  While some of them are not my favorite,I absolutely love the Coffee Shop and the Buffet.  While the Coffee Shop may seem pricey, I guarantee you will not leave their hungry.  They give you decent servings, especially the fried chicken meal and the spaghetti w/ meatballs meal.  The Buffet at TI is also really good.  Prices are par for it's neighbors (Mirage, Venetian, Caesars, etc), but personally I think the food quality and service are just a tad bit better than the rest.. . BARS -  3 Stars  . This is the area where TI needs to step it up a notch.  Granted they have Gilley's, but there are also plenty of other chain country bars on the strip (such as Toby Kieth's at Harrah's).  And while Senior Frogs has a great view of Sirens Cove and the Strip, I think something custom to TI would make the experience a whole lot better.  Oddly, out of all the bar selections at TI, my favorite is Breeze Bar, smack dab in the middle of the casino.  I would rate this one 5 stars on it's own.  Great atmosphere, decent drink prices, friendly staff, and did I mention it's right in the middle of the casino?  Perfect spot to people watch and have a few drinks.. . SPORTS BOOK -  4 Stars  . While not my favorite sports book in Vegas, TI has a pretty nice one.  As always, the staff is very friendly, and willing to help you understand anything and everything about sports betting if you have questions (they just won't make recommendations on who to wager for/against).  This SB is also pretty clean and the cocktail waitresses seem to come around more often than at other SB's in Vegas. . . STAFF - 5 Stars. Overall, the staff in general (front desk, casino, restaurant/bars, housekeeping) are great and deserve 5 stars.
In the not too distant past, I had the opportunity to stay at Treasure Island Casino and Resort. The accommodations at this establishment were some of the most horrid that I've ever experienced. So much so, I checked out after two days and moved to Encore . Simply put, it was far below my expectations for the Vegas Strip.  First, the decor was a touch outdated and seasoned to put it gently. To give perspective to the rooms, one would compare the accommodations to a Hampton Inn outside of a major Midwest city. . . The run down is as follows:. . The water never got quite hot.. . This establishment deploys a sensor (motion/body-heat/whatever) thermostat to determine if someone is in the room. However, if one is sleep then little-to-no movement in sensed thus the thermostat will not kick on to cool the room. As a result, it felt like a muggy summer's day in NOLA. . . The room smelled of smoke (it was faint but there). . The ironing board was broken. . The television had poor volume control. When turned on it would blare so loudly it could startle you. . . The noise level was atrocious....      Although TI can't do much about its patrons, perhaps installing doors that don't slam shut will improve the overall experience for all guest.. .      Did you know there is a flight path right over the strip? Exactly, I didn't either until I stayed in this hotel. It may be difficult to change flight paths but installing windows to block out the sound of a jet flying overhead will help tremendously. Quite frankly their competitors across the street (I stayed at them all) solved this problem. . .      I like to party as much as the next guy. After "going hard" during a night or day in Vegas, one needs to sleep off the after affects. The DJ at the pool is nice but kept me up while I was trying to recover in time for round two.. . The pool was small and lacked limes to make the drinks I wanted. Although the bar tenders dudes behind the bar were cool and funny.. . The pool's bar maids/waitresses didn't seem very interested in their job. Most spent time in the back and rarely brought out drinks or even engaged the customers.
So this was get away and I was nervous because of the reviews I read on the internet and even here on yelp. The check in time for the hotel is 3 pm but they had a sign saying they would let us check in at noon. If you want to check in early it's a $25 charge. Hmmm... There are extra charges in a lot of areas for check ins and check outs. Check out time is 12 but if you pay $30 you can have a late check out at 3 pm. I don't have of an opinion on that bit find that interesting.. . Now the hotel itself has a very unpleasant smell when you come into the lobby. You get used to it after time but everything we entered the casino or lobby area it wS very strong. Luckily for us the hotel room was awesome. We got a deluxe room on the 30th floor. It was the most spacious bedroom I've seen for a standard room . We had a nice king bed. The tv though was small... Like about 26". When we got into the room it didn't turn on but when we called down to lobby they fixed it within a couple hours. I consider that good service.. . The bathroom was also spacious. The bathtub was huge and the room was clean. There was no dirty carpet that we could tell of. . . We stayed for 3 nights and the cleaning was awesome. I wouldn't mind staying here because the location wasn't too bad and there is a free metro that goes to the mirage hotel.
