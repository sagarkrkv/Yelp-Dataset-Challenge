eat. is a local-focused place worth checking out!. . I haven't been here for the lunch options, but the breakfast options are on point!  Their Truffled Egg Sandwich is solid and so is the Eggs Benedict.  The Truffled Egg Sandwich comes with eggs, bacon, creamy feta cheese, wild mushrooms, chives, and is served on ciabatta bread with potatoes.  I was a fan of the Huevos Montulenos and would certainly recommend it for the slightly more adventurous eater...lots of flavors coming together to party on you palate.  The Huevos Montulenos consists of a tortilla layered with black beans, sweet peas, feta cheese, caramelized bananas or plantains, covered with two fried eggs, and finished with slightly spicy red and green salsas.  It is also served with a pile of potatoes.. . The interior is aesthetically pleasing.  Artistic. Hip. Positioned well.  eat. fits perfectly in it's downtown surroundings...you could say that eat is right up DTLV's alley...no literally it is right up from that one alley downtown...on Carson...you know?. . They are doing a lot of things right here, and I will be back again!
My favorite part was being able to say 'more mothership coffee' please. How often does one get to say the word mothership! Ordered a BLT Which was a 5 star experience ... And a single pancake on the side for good luck. Best flapjack in town probably
The food was very good, the service was great. Very busy at lunch, love the atmosphere. Easy to find street parking nearby, right on the corner of Carson and 7th.
wow!!! just wow!! this place is great and the ambiance is so cute. we went here on the way to the spartan race, and we weren't disappointed. . . the pancakes were big, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. and with two toddlers (12 month & 20 month) with us, they liked the food too. the corn beef hash was delicious. . . too bad we couldn't enjoy it as much as we'd hope, had to eat & go (time crunch), but will definitely revisit again when we're back.
Short:. Food: pretty good. Ambiance: cute. Service: really good - lots of people working. . Long:. . Food: I got the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup, and my boyfriend had the - prime rib? roast beef? can't remember - special hash. The grilled cheese and soup were good, but I was disappointed by how high the bread:cheese ratio was. 2" of bread for a very thin layer of cheese. The hash was also good, but I wish the potatoes had a little more bite to them, rather than just being mushy. The COFFEE, however, is fantastic and delicious. . Ambiance: I really liked the way the place was done. Felt like a casual, industrial cafe. It's not easy to pull off the steel & concrete look without looking cheap, but they nailed it. The inside of the door says "ate" (as you are exiting), which I thought was super cute. . Service: There were a TON of people working. They were all friendly and responsive without being intrusive. . . If I'm in downtown, I'd definitely come here again, but not sure I'd make the trek all the way from Henderson *just* to eat here, if you know what I mean.
Absolutely delicious!!! Fresh homemade goodness!! Great service!! If you want all of the breakfast choices you need to get there before 11am.
Maybe I waited too long to try this place? Maybe it was great when they first opened? Pretty solid 5 star rating on here, something is awry. . . Came in on a Saturday morning, we had expected to wait so that was no big deal, gave us a chance to look over the menu and yelp pics. . . After seeing all the reviews and praise for the Huevos Montulenos, I decided to give it a go, even tho on paper it sounded horrid. I like weird combinations, so I was willing to give it a shot. My friend got the Eggs Benedict. . . Food arrives. A few bites into our food, both of look at each other, and I know exactly what she is thinking. I told her mine was really gross and she agreed. I like peas, I like bananas and I love feta. But the combination of them with black beans and eggs and sauce didn't work for me. I made her give it a try and she was mad at me once she put it in her mouth (hey, sharing is caring). I tried her Benny's and I agreed they were underwhelming. Turkey bacon had no flavor, and the addition of spinach and tomatoes really overpowered the Hollandaise. . . In addition to two terrible entrees, this place is ridiculously loud. I had to raise my voice a couple octaves to talk to my friend who was sitting 2 feet in front of me. . . Overpriced . Loud . Gross food. Parking sucks
I was completely disappointed in the quality of the food.  I work downtown and my office mates and I order from Eat quite regularly, but today we were shocked to have received some of the worst food we've ever eaten from Eat.  We ordered both of the chicken sandwiches that are on the limited menu only to discover they were obviously made from frozen chicken breasts that were rubbery and tasted like plastic.  The bread was soggy which, when combined with the disgusting chicken made our sandwiches inedible.  My co worker and I ended up throwing both of our lunches away.  We were also told they no longer are making beignets, which we came to really enjoy.  We vowed never to order from this place again as the food definitely does not match the prices charged, and as there are so many other lunch spots to pick from, we won't miss this eatery.
One of the most incredible restaurants downtown. Not only is the food amazing, but the environment and the staff are perfect. I wish I could give a rating higher than a five!
Where to go for a good breakfast after a red-eye flight to Vegas? Try "eat." in downtown Vegas. Unusual name, yes, highly recommended!. . Located on the 1st floor of an apartment building at the corner of Carson St. & 7th St., "eat." is a casual & trendy restaurant known for its upscale American breakfast/lunch entrees w/ southern & New Mexican touches, while using quality & locally sourced products. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=sloCm07roLTYRRVg5PHCJQ . . During a recent Vegas trip during Spring break, my son & I had our 1st meal in Vegas - breakfast at eat. on a weekday mid-morning.  Our entrees were delicious, & the presentations were eye-catching. We had the following:. . - Golden-brown pancakes w/ chicken-apple sausage ($9). This order came w/ thick pancakes w/ a grilled chicken-apple sausage sliced down the middle & garnished w/ powdered sugar & a strawberry sliced in half. The pancakes, crispy at the edges & so fluffy & soft on the inside, were perfectly done.  They were so delicious & were the best that I've tasted! They came w/ butter & cute little sealed jars of 100% maple syrup from Vermont, instead of the sticky tabletop syrup dispensers; the pancakes were so flavorful that you really didn't need to use that much syrup. The entree is so generous that I could not finish it; next time, I'll just have a side order of one pancake to satisfy my craving & try another entree. The full order would have been good to share amongst a group of people. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=d371vDGyCTtrV47Wfezxig . . - DWBLTA w/ fresh made-from-scratch tomato soup & pickle ($11). This sandwich is their version of a BLT consisting of smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, & avocado w/ chipotle mayo on buttery toasted sourdough.  (DW stands for Don Welch, who is one of the restaurant's investors.) I was impressed w/ the thick slices of smoked bacon & avocado, which made the sandwich very creamy & savory; the ingredients complemented each other very well. The tomato soup was very flavorful.  This entree is a winner! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=KfcNl_Zk82sijLfZcCy5Rw . . We chose the above two entrees based on the resounding comments posted in other Yelp reviews. They also have other popular dishes which we will try  the next time:  chicken fried steak, shrimp & grits, beignets, huevos motulenos, eggs done in different ways, salads, many types of sandwiches (roast beef, chicken, grilled cheese, veggie burger, Rueben, shrimp), & freshly made chips. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=HaumAEuf9JqmIJP_lQej4g http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=epkj9L81E8G3DUDyjjNq5A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=xKU896f0iS1uFBqYkSFEgg . . Service was very attentive, as the servers, in their signature black attire, ensured that our orders came quickly, dirty dishes taken away promptly, water glasses refilled regularly,& periodic checking in assuring that everything was okay. In fact, I found out afterwards that chef/owner Natalie Young will appear in the dining room & converse w/ diners to get feedback in improving her operation (I don't recall if she did talk to us, as I didn't know who she was at that time.). . The restaurant seats about 60 people. The interior is full of charm w/ a mixture of brick & green walls & a cemented floor. The walls are adorned w/ artwork of local artists.  There are orange metal chairs made from recycled materials, partial booths of a green color, tables, & a bar counter facing an open kitchen. Fabric napkins are used. Cute recyclable boxes are used for doggie bags. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=zsaULVQQOqXcBg4WOb7eBA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=4Pp0OeG2PEltnI1XhuvK-Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=1XAw57xgR3526XmFH1h4Tw . . Opened in Sept. 2012, eat. was the first restaurant to be part of the Downtown Revitalization Project in luring businesses to be part of the permanent venture. Its chef & owner, Natalie Young, was tapped for this restaurant; she had 12 years of previous experience at restaurants on the Strip, such as Hard Rock Cafe, MGM Grand, & Paris LAS. She named the restaurant "eat." to describe a place where locals can come, eat, & talk/enjoy one another. In its first 34 days of opening, the restaurant served 2,300 customers!. . Metered curbside parking available.  No reservations taken. We did not have a problem in finding a parking space, nor did we have to wait to be seated, probably because it was midmorning on a weekday; we heard that there are lines on weekends.. . Can't wait for our next trip to Vegas so we can eat at eat.!
This place is 5  stars hands down in my book.  Walked right in, got seated right away.  Intimate setting.  Had 2 waitresses helping us, 1 to take and bring drink order, one to take food order.  Coffee was black and strong, just the way I like it, and the food came out super fast.  Had the shrimp and grits and it was amazeballs!  Complete soul food.
Love the grilled cheese and tomatoe soup. Found th is place through yelp, and now I never visit Vegas without a stop here.
First off, I just want to say, what a lively and well thought out title you have!! It  does absolutely nothing for the ambiance, environment, or atmosphere.. . So we go into this place that closes in 45 minutes (2:00pm) and we are seated with an effortless menu in our hands.  If you have seen the 90's movie "My Cousin Vinny" then you had a choice of:. Breakfast . or. Lunch. I had the lunch, my mother had the lunch, and my sister had the breakfast.  The prices were steep for no apparent reason.  I'll tell you why.  . This "cafe" sits behind the newly constructed Container Park near the downtown area and gives off no connection to the "urban" look that the whole community is looking for.  If this place is not known by word of mouth then one would think it was an old relentless leasing place trying to scrape money to stay and keep its doors open. You would also think it has been here at least since the early 80's.. Good for them for putting their name out there by social media, but I honestly don't see how this is going make it for long.  The food screams help at the top of its lungs because they are in desperate need of taste, flavor, and palate cleansing.  With a menu that only has maybe and I mean MAYBE 3 or 4 choices for lunch or breakfast that their descriptive plate names would coincide with the food that you get. I feel like the kitchen is saying, "heh heh heh, just kidding no soup for you and if you want pico de gallo then cut up your own tomato."  Yes folks, I asked for pico de gallo but all I got was chopped up tomatoes in a ginormous bowl with one scoop of pico in it (i got charged $.50 for one scoop of a tomato!!) So anyways, we get our food and it is simply not- that- great.   I could've easily gone to one of the local casinos that always advertises steak and eggs for $4.99 or even pancakes for cheaper price.  . However, the point of going to this place was to seek out some truth that lies behind the whole commutative urban development surrounding the newly improved downtown area.  This new area is supposed to cater to the locals that is why they replenished and rejuvenated this whole neighborhood in the first place.  Well, hello, I did expect the prices to be more for me, the local, not the tourist.  . It doesn't matter anymore, what does matter is that if you want to keep your high prices and rip off your customers from not serving urban stylish food than don't stay open too long, and move to the strip where you can rip off all the tourist you want.
eat. was good, and I'd definitely come back. I wasn't wow-ed by my meal, but overall, I was happy with the experience here.  One of my friends described it as ,"a diner with a good attitude" and that fits it almost exactly.  It is urban-hip in decor, and a pretty small restaurant overall.  On a Sunday at 1p, expect a 20 minute wait.  I don't know if it was the acoustics, but it was pretty loud in there, so we chose to wait on the benches outside.. . The servers were friendly and pleasant, and the coffee was strong and hot. I'd already scoped out the menu online, but alas, the menu at the restaurant was not exactly the same (no Shrimp Po Boy?! GASP!) . . Luckily, I had a second choice in mind.  I ordered the Shrimp & Grits, and yep... My Yelp-ers were correct, those are some runny grits!! I generally don't like my grits so thin.  However, it comes with a lot of shrimp (no tails, either!), big slabs of bacon, and an egg (it comes poached, but they ask how you like it, so I ordered it cooked a little harder).  . . Because the grits were so thin, I stole my friend's delicious sourdough toast, which was soft and buttery, just the way I like it. The bread helped to sop up the grits, so maybe this meal should come with bread?  My friend enjoyed her corrnbeef hash, and loved that it tasted fresh and homemade. Our other dining companions got the grilled cheese and the huevo ranchero and both said they were delicious. . . I'm glad to have a brunch option downtown, and eat. did the trick!
Food, great. Service, leaves something to be desired.. . Food: I got the biscuits and turkey sausage, and both were great. The others I went with ordered a combination of breakfast and lunch foods, and all agreed their dishes tasted delicious.. . Service: Came on a Friday, mid morning. Took about 40 minutes to be seated. Initial drink orders were taken pretty quickly, but everything after was slow. My friend got coffee served in a cup that had lipstick on it. Took forever to flag down the waitress, who took it away and then forgot to bring more. Even though the place is small, finding and getting the attention of our waitress was a challenge. I know the restaurant hasn't been around long, and it still has some kinks to work out.
I have had the pleasure of eating at EAT twice the both times were fabulous.  I had the shrimp and grits both times.  The grits were creamy perfect and the shrimp were huge.  It gets kind of loud around the heat of lunch (go figure), but everything else is fantastic.
Really solid breakfast eats with great coffee. Homey hipster diner feel in the rejuvenated downtown area off the strip. Not sure I would spend another $30 for the cab ride but glad we tried it. Had the truffled egg sandwich and the strawberry cinnamon biscuits!
This place is great!! Decent portions, cute modern ambiance, definitely where you'd find hipsters dwell..hence the name 'eat.' Lol I love that it's across container park, which was convenient for us to park (which sux, $1/hour)... we brought kids with us so some had the grilled cheese, which were humoungous & came with awesome tomato soup. Their Wedge Salad was awesome! Huge with lots of bacon lol (not very healthy but looked sooo good!). I had the Truffled Egg Sandwich, which was ok... my cousin & I were disappointed because we really wanted the Eggs Turkey Benedict but we got there too late. This should be a breakfast item serve til closing. My son had the cinnamon biscuits w/ strawberry sauce.. omg sooooo yummmy! Other than that? I would most definitely go back again! I love any downtown good eats!!
Very hearty, but high quality good here ..love the shrimp n grits, Rueben, and dBLT sandwich.  Quaint little place downtown and always busy ..good sign.
Since I read all the ratings for this place I was really looking forward to having breakfast there. Coming with my 14years old son I have to admit we both enjoyed it a lot! Service very friendly, breakfast very tasty, fresh and delicious, nice guests, nice place and in this artificial glittery Las Vegas universe a very down to earth place which is really fun to go to.. All thumbs up!!
Happy to report that our second visit was just as satisfying. generous portions. flavorful. I ordered their homemade corned beef hash with eggs. I'm high maintenance when it comes to eggs -- don't cringe: over hard with the yokes broken and crispy on the edges. Well, the eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash was as good as homemade. Hubby ordered chicken fried steak again. Yum. Our go to breakfast place when visiting Las Vegas.
Awesome place! . . I liked the trendy vibe it had. I prefer this place rather the hash hash a go go for sure. . . Very friendly service and attentive to my needs. . . Food was fresh and had a great presentation. . . When I come back to downtown Las Vegas I have to hit up this place again.
DBLTA sandwich + pancakes for two ppl. We don't know the pancake and the sandwich will be that big. Worth the price, the veg in the sandwich is fresh. Ice tea is great, love it cuz it's not sweet.
This place is wonderful. If it's crowded (which is always is) it is totally worth the wait. The service is always friendly and attentive and the food is never sub-par. My only gripe is that you can't get pancakes past 11am. They are the best!
Grits! Ask them not to put onions on top, and to bring butter and maple syrup, unhealthy heaven.... We visited this place twice recently, once on a Tuesday morning, which was a five star visit, and then once on Saturday, which was a one and a half star experience, so I am averaging them out. Our first visit was in a large group, with four adults and three boisterous children, the waiter was unperturbed by our large group and we were seated pretty quickly at the communal table. I had the veggie burger, which was more of a large toasted sandwich of indescribable deliciousness, and an orange juice which, although "regular" in size was large and pulp free and quite wonderful. One of our friends had the shrimp & grits dish which she absolutely loved as well. The service was good, the food arrived quickly and the multiple servings of grits which my daughter mowed through were hot, scrumptious and seemingly bottomless.. Now, Saturday... we waited an exceedingly long time for a table, the hostess told us it would be around 30 minutes, and we were seated in the busiest thoroughfare more than 45 minutes later. The waitress brought our menus, which were considerably smaller than the weekday menu and distinctly lacking in vegetarian options, and then disappeared for an extended period. We asked if they could do the veg burger but they said no, and at this point I didn't want to wait at another restaurant so we decided to stay, I eventually decided on the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo, which does not come with chips - this was not noted on the menu where it actually says that all sandwiches are served with chips or potato salad, but when I asked after the chips I was told they would be an additional side and that the soup, which was part of the meal on the menu, was in fact a side I had ordered. This was a rather awkward exchange and I gave up on my lovely chips. The soup was thin, and the cheese was lurid orange, plasticky processed American cheese instead of the "sharp cheddar" on the menu. This made me sad. The bread is doorstop thick and soft, which is a perk. We felt very rushed, and they brought the check before we had finished eating, or, in fact ordering, as well as removing dishes before we had finished eating. Its a really fabulous place to eat, during the week, but give the weekends a miss.
Came here with a large group (12 of us) on a Saturday around 1PM. We were seated in about 15-20 minutes which isn't bad.. . The 2 stars essentially came from my specific dish. I ordered the country fried steak as did two other people at my table. They loved theirs, and I'm sure I would too if it didn't take me 5 minutes to cut off a piece of mine. I'm not asking for them to give each person a steak knife; I'm asking you not to give me a horrible piece of meat while the other two people got the good pieces at my table. I don't understand why it would take me twice as long to chew my food as it did for me to cut it. I left the place hungry because all I ate was th strawberry, eggs, and toast that came with this dish. Why I am paying so much to leave hungry? I even ate someone's leftover grilled cheese and soup.
Lovely meal! . . It's been so long since we ate here that we cannot remember what we had, but we remember the owner being a doll and the food was divine! . . Local. Small. Fantastic. . . Go, you!
