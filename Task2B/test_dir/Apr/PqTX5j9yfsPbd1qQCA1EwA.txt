I can't accurately describe how disappointing I found this nightclub. I'm a simple country girl from NC, so I had high hopes for a Vegas club. That said:. -We "squeaked in" without paying cover by having a friend put our names "on the list." I was not impressed by the triaging of guests into three lines by burly guys trying to look like the Secret Service. . -Finding the club itself was like a scavenger hunt. I can't speak for fellow ladies, but four flights of stairs is not easy to navigate in heels. If you've never been, save yourself a headache and just have someone escort you, or better yet, carry you.. -The club was much smaller than the website would lead you to believe. High ceilings do not a hype club make.. -The prices! Oh, horror! The prices! I KNOW it's Vegas, but $10 for a Bud Light? If you're ready for a laugh, check out the preposterously overpriced bottle menu. We were lucky enough to step in on "open bar for ladies", which islimited to "mixed well drinks" (I know I'm using a lot of quotations, but stick with me here). I ended up paying full price for my drinks, because the inattentive, often dismissive bartenders seemed to have mixed up the well liquor with gasoline.. -Oh, and those nice couches? Don't get comfortable. My party was moved several times to make room for people who wanted to pay $900 for a bottle of Grey Goose.. -The cherry on the top of this hot mess was the incompetent DJ. Bless her heart, she really tried, but any DJ who's worth their salt knows that a party is created with beat-mixing popular or power songs. This poor little girl did little more than drop in one song after another, often on top of off beats. My professional DJ husband was near tears by the time we left.. I walked past ten better places to get a drink and have fun just to get to this place. Don't make that mistake. This nightclub would do far better to lose the ego and embrace the intimacy of an otherwise classy enclave.
Went to Tao this weekend for my bday and had a ball! Music and crowd were awesome with a mix of pop/hip hop and house music. The lighting also has a trippy, unusual strobe effect which I thought was very cool.  Cover is $20. I took off a star because there's zero seating unless you are in VIP. Also there's steps up into the club, so the combo of those two things + heels sucks. Other than that though, Tao was great!
Here I am once again
Came here this past Friday for my friend's bachelorette party. We love Tao that's why we wanted to kick off the trip there. Music was great as always. The crowd was awesome, everyone is all from out of town so we're all just trying to have a good time. No lines and open bar and table. It was great! :)
Partied with Hitachi Data Systems at Tao.  We were served fried rice, broccoli, Kung Pao Chicken, shrimp, and Korean beef.  It was delicious, but I'm dying thirst.  They must use MSG.  :P
Heard lots of good things about this nightclub, so we decided to check it out. We received a coupon from the bellman when we checked in, so it was even more inciting to go. Located inside of the Venetian, it seems to be one of the more popular places on the strip. We arrived around 10pm and had to wait in line for about 15 minutes, which isn't too bad for Vegas. Once we got in, you were either in or shuffled around like you didn't belong. Almost the entire bar is roped off for people that make reservations or have money. We wanted to get on the main dance floor, but unless you had a wrist band, it was a no-go. We found another dance floor where we danced the night away, but it was also surrounded by roped-off sections with bottle service. There was a bar near, that they closed early. So, my advice if you truly want to enjoy he nightclub, book a party or bottle service. . If you eat at the restaurant, you have free entry to the nightclub, so that might be a way to go too!
Yup, this is probably my favorite club in Vegas since I've always had a blast.. . Located in the Venetian, its an Asian temple-ish themed club. There's tubs of rose petals, flying acrobats during certain times, and raised platforms to dance in. With a group of mostly girls + promoter, you can get free entry + drink wristbands until a certain time. . . The music is usually hip hop / top 40, which I absolutely love. The dance floor is a bit small, so it can get crowded; however, if you have a group of girls, try dancing on the raised platforms!! Not only do you have room to breathe, but you can also avoid aggressive creepers. It's a win win situation.. . I love you Tao and I will come back soon.
TAO night club gets four stars because: I can usually get all the girls in for free, I can usually walk up to the front and get in for free if I'm by myself, get bottle service here for the guys for not that bad of a price, have gotten guys in for free, & this is probably my most frequented club in Vegas due to these things. Five stars for my promoters!. . This club can get extremely crowded. Changed the layout of the main room so you can see the DJ from most tables and the front entrance. Hip hop room is also very crowded. I wouldn't actually recommend this club if you didn't have a table! . . The bathroom lines here are crazy! Just like any other club, but you stand in line for girls on the second floor and you can look at the crowd below. It's almost inconvenient where it's located and people have to walk by for their tables. Generally not too bad. . . Bouncers here are more strict than the other clubs I've been to, so just beware. . . Decor is darker and red - obviously Asian themed. Lots of girls sitting around posing. The DJ main stage has better lighting and effects now. . . Most of my experiences have been alright at this club, not my favorite. (You run into the most creepers here I feel like) I would recommend if you have a table or can't get into other clubs for free and you have a good promoter. Maybe if your favorite is playing here too.
Get here early!. . Decor was nice. Expensive as hell......but it's Vegas.  I'm not much of a nightclub person. I just don't get why everyone likes to jam pack themselves onto the dancefloor.... or should I say standfloor... not enough room to move.. . Good music. Good atmosphere.  Bartenders were a bit snobby.  I kept going to the back bar because there were no lines but around 11pm.....they closed that side ?!?!  They really like to keep us jam-packed together don't they?. . It was fun.....after we were inebriated. lol!
Worst nightclub ever. I was trying to leave when in dark stairwell was attacked by a bouncer. I fought to get free from him. Very scary experience. Did police report all night & nobody cared. Had bruises all over arms & chest. Never heard from nightclub or police again.
Always was a fan of this club. Get there early though cos sometimes it takes forever to get in.  Also, find someone to give you VIP/guestlist passes. You'll save yourself money. If you ask the concierge at Venetian, they usually will have some handy for you.. . Music is great, club is big and if you feel claustrophobic, you can stand out on the balcony.
Dinner and Nightclub package.. Best deal in Vegas! The food is amazing and you get a table with on bottle in the club, its cheaper than buying just a bottle in the club. Do it!
