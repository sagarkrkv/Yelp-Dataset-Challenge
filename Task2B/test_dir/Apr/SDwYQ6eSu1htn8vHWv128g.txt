I have been going to Postino for years and they have the most consistent food and service you will find anywhere in the Valley.  I often get cravings for their Mediterranean salad and bruschetta.  Oh, don't forget the olives, too!
Love just about everything on the menu here!!!
Fantastic patio, fantastic bruchetta, italian picnic salad is great.  I could eat here every day.. . My only complaint is happy hour ends at 5pm.
Great place to eat and drink for happy happy happy hour! $5 wine and great bruschetta!
Nice place. Good food tastes fresh and light. No spirits as this place serves only beer and wine. PARKING IS HORRIBLE. Get valet!
I love Postino! There is nothing better than sitting outside on a lovely afternoon, sipping wine and munching on the best bruschetta board in Phoenix. This is one of my favorite places to go for happy hour, appetizers, wine and/or dinner, and I'll continue to go back often.

Love this place. Wish I lived closer to go more often!!
Great food and boards
Cactus Moon is a nice little stop over by Cabela's on 202 and Dobson. I only go there to play poker with the Dream Dealers on Tuesdays. My regular order is  the pound of wings for $5 and then usually a Three Olive Vodka special. Lots of combos there, and all are tasty. There are TVs all around the place so now that baseball season is in swing you have no problems in seeing a game if its on. The service is friendly and the food comes up quick.
Awesome food and wine! This is my new Tuesday spot for their $20 bottle of wine and board of bruschetta!
Arcadia area is very cool and Postino fits right in
On a Monday/Tuesday night, if you time it right, Postino's is a neighborhood staple in Arcadia. The $20 for a bottle and board of bruschetta is a *steal*. As one of employee said, "How could you not order this?" while we waited for our table.  . . My friend and I arrived early to request a table for four. Perched on a tall side table we enjoyed a full view of the restaurant. Sipping not so daintily we quickly passed the 45 minute wait.  . . Once seated Bethany was a wonder. Our bill was seamlessly transferred and waters arrived. The neat thing about traveling in a pack of four is that, Yes, You Can drink three bottles of wine. What could possibly be better than that? It removes the need to think hard about the bruschetta menu. (There are 12 options so we had one of each brought out.). . We surprised the fella in the group. He doubted that three bruschetta boards would be sufficient to feed his hungry belly. If you haven't been before, a bruschetta is palm sized and sliced into four pieces. Trust me, there's plenty. . . But if you're still hungry this is a wine bar and they have food. The panini selection is wonderful, I beg to argue the Nine Iron is the best.  (Bacon layered with grilled chicken, burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise!) Another approach, perhaps on another visit, is to order the Butchers Block (big assortment of meat and cheese) for $14 and/or the Cheese Board for $13.. . If for some reason wine is not up your alley, Postino's offers pitchers of beer. If you need to drink a cocktail...suck it up kid. That's not happening here. The Mon/Tue special begins at 8pm. I'd recommend scoring a table before the start time, even if that means buying some appetizers beforehand. . . Make sure to ask for Bethany! She's the sweetest thing!
I love Postino.  How can you not?  I love the $5 glasses of wine before 5:00.  I love the staff.  Tell them what you like and they make the most perfect recommendations.  And nothing beats the bruschetta- I get cravings for that stuff.  The whole staff rocks at this location.  Very different (and better) vibe than Central.
Great ambience in particular if the doors are open to the outside.  Bruschetta and charcuterie boards are both great and the wine is pretty reasonable.  Yum!
I love Postino! It is such a cute place for a date, girls dinner or anything! We had wine, bruschetta and a sandwich and it was all delicious! Will definitely be back!
amazing food, you literally can not go wrong with any of the bruschetta toppings. I even tried their seasonal one for kicks and it was delicious too... . you will love it, but you will hate the wait.. still worth it.. especially the board and bottle deal.
I was excited to try this restaurant as cheese, bread, and wine are my favorite food groups, and I have tosay, it didn't disappoint.  Thankfully, my friends are similarly like minded and we feasted on bruschetta, cheese plates, and assorted dips.  While not the most balanced of dinners, it was incredibly delicious.  . . I plan on coming back here and gorging on cheese the next time I'm in the area.
