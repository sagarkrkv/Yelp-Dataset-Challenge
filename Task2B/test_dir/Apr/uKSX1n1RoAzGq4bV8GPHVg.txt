Excellent food. Quality ingredients prepared simply, and so tasty! Love sitting by the oven in the open kitchen...watching the chefs work!
Such a great spot! The atmosphere is fantastic, staff is super nice, and the food -OMG! Everything, I mean everything, on the menu is delicious. Weekend Brunch has live music and the patio is delightful.
Actually had a great time here this Sunday morning. Food was amazing and service on par. I highly recommend the mushroom omelette.
The place is really cozy and the setup of the whole place is very relaxing. They offer indoor and outdoor tables which allow you to enjoy both the great winter and spring Phoenix weather while also giving some needed cover during those hot summer days (and nights). . . We enjoyed the Eggs Benedict. It was really good!!!! Order it with the salmon. Hollandiase sauce was one of the best i've tried.. . We also ordered The French Onion burger. It was just OK. I ordered it to be cooked medium, but it was served well done instead. It came out a little dry for my taste. The fried onion and argula were great.. . Let's see what the pancakes would be like.... . Waiting for the pancake for 15mins now.... . Food was served fast earlier.... . Ok, Let's do a follow-up on my pancake.... . Looks like they forgot our order =(. . Manager went out to speak to us about the delay. He did apologize for the delay and informed us that they are preparing our pancake and it is off the bill. Good! nope... GREAT!!!!!. . Pancake? It's worth the wait! The crispy edges from cooking it on hot iron skillet and brick oven mixed with caramelized apples and dark chocolate was really really good. . . Will I come back? Yes! In a heartbeat! I do have some recommendations.. Menu is confusing. They have a different menu for sundays and saturdays as compared to weekdays, different menu after 3pm, and a different menu after 5pm. Its hard to keep up... . more reviews at . http://themealexperience.blogspot.com/
On one hand, every single time I go here for Sunday brunch it is AMAZING. On the other hand, each time I come here for weekday lunch i am disappointed. For example, last time I came I ordered the lunch quinoa stuffed peppers. It came out not fully cooked and cold throughout. I wanted to return it to have it heated up more, but they service was so slow I didn't see our server again for at least 40 minutes. I ended up being forced to eat my half cooked, cold stuffed peppers. Then, when I was in a hurry to return to work our server was again nowhere to be found and what should have been a 45 minute-hour long lunch was easily 1.5 hours.
Wow.  First 5 stars I've given.  . Everything was fantastic.  . Had the cucumber cooler- gin, muddled cucumber, lemon and lemonade - very fresh and delicious.. Ordered the "roasted salmon superfood"  - -salmon was cooked to perfection and went beautifully with the cucumber and avocado and the vinaigrette was great. . Got the side of fingerling potatoes, also very tasty. . Sat at the bar- trendy atmosphere in the open air.. Amazing!!   If I lived in Phoenix id definitely be a regular! :)
Hey Yall...do it for yelp, I anit gon do it...actually I am. So I arrive @ 5.06 Kayla finally makes her way over excuse about huge table....you should have passed me on..ijs..so I ordered the meatballs and corn polenta...oh yea a cucumber lemonade type drink...so my food arrives @ 6 @ 6.06 I am GONE. Why everything was freaking COLD now the meatballs come in a skillet the was piping HOT and on the 1st bite...I'm like is this cold....not cool, but REFRIGERATOR COLD....you know how food has sat then you add more sauce straight from the icebox and don't re-warm it...YEP..YELP JUST LIKE THAT.....The polenta let's just say that I literally stuck my finger in it with another waiter cause that Kayla was busy working....I even had the other waiter touch the meatballs and he confirmed ICY and apologized immediately...here BEELINES the manager one of us was obviously exhausted cause I didn't here him introduce himself. He was kind enough to offer me a baguette to take home....oh its gets better because he then offered me a chicken salad sandwich...I asked the chicken salad sandwich Kayla mentioned you guys were out of....oh okay...it must have been the gtfooh expression on my face...cause he then offered a 25 gift card. I promptly accepted and headed to my next location.....Mexican Food....update coming to night. I will possibly try on the weekend if not I will give it away after all I am a TEXAN!!!!
While again, the food is good.... the service is less than desirable.. . Picture it: three ladies who have been friends for over 10 years.. ladies' night out.. let's have some drinks and food and enjoy our company while away from the stresses of life (kids, jobs, etc.) . . So. Goat cheese app. Delicious.. . Ordered two glasses of wine. Get them. . . 20 mins.... flag someone down to order food! Please! Ok, he was attending to the people by the bread... ok... they don't have a table yet?. . Ordered food. Wine empty.. where is the waiter?? Flag him down again. Oh, and can we get a refill on water? Sure!. . Wine comes. No water. Wait .. wait ... wait... oh can I get you something else? Yes.. wine is empty again and still no water.... . On a $135 check between 3 people, this is not an inexpensive place. But I can go somewhere a lot less expensive with equitable food and get better service. I'm not asking to be treated like a queen. Just want my water refilled and question if my wine should be.. . I can't dock the food at either of Aaron Chamberlain's restaurants. Just the service sucks.
Food- Above average. Service- atrocious. Beer Selection- sub par. Atmosphere & Decor- sexy. . Would I go back- No. . . Will I recommend to a close friend- No. . . Why?. . Called half hour before I arrived "no wait" for three (Saturday night for 3)...arrive with a whomping 45 min wait. . . I overhear the hostess totally give another customer crap about arriving for a reservation for two- with three people.  Saying that they mainly accommodate parties of two bc of the way their tables are set up...man up and put two tables together!! It's worth it not pissing people off or turning them away. . . Next- we sit down at a long booth for six and don't get attended to for at least ten to fifteen mins. . Finally have to order the hostess to retrieve our bumbling waitress. She takes our orders.. Annoying- they're supposed to be known for their bread--they didn't even have their well known baguette to order as an appetizer- pathetic. . Drinks don't arrive for another ten mins at least- after our appetizers. . . It doesn't end there- . Our supposed orders arrive--they were wrong. . They forget to make my burger and arrived with some other sandwich. . . The waitress didn't even acknowledge that it was her fault or anyone's.. . The burger finally arrived, we ate. . The food was good and dessert was too. . . In the end we should have been comp'd a dessert or something for the extended, sub par dinner. . . I don't recommend this place to anyone. . . There's a Sweet Tomato across the street- at least they have parking...
I was not sold on this place the first time I came, because the menu seemed a bit contrived and each dish had one ingredient that put it over the top but I returned because the atmosphere is incredible - I could go on for paragraphs about the details, but I won't!  After returning multiple times over the years, I think the menu has mellowed a bit (or I have gotten used to it), and we have enjoyed each and every time we have dined with them, we've even gone on Anniversaries, etc.  The burger is one of the best I've had with ingredients on all dishes being as fresh as possible.  Thumbs way up!
I am here in Phoenix visiting ASU with my family. We saw this restaurant on Diners Drive Ins and Dives, and we thought we would give this place a shot. . . We were not disappointed to say the least. I ordered the pork dip which came on their homemade baguette. It was amazing. I also ordered the Moroccan meatballs which were very rich. The salad that came with the pork dip was so refreshing. The salad dressing was very tasty (aged cheddar buttermilk mixed with apple cider vinaigrette). The service was superb. Definitely coming back!
Pros: 1. good atmosphere 2. great patio 3. Cheap happy hour drinks 4. food is good. **bread is amazing and so is the goat cheese**. . Cons: 1.only valet parking on Saturday (maybe all the time, I've only been on Saturday) 2. the hipster staff is just nice enough to get the 15% tip they deserve ( no I didn't leave that bad of a tip but they really don't deserve more)
I loved everything about this place! We went for brunch. There was me, the die-hard carnivore, my best friend, the closet vegetarian and his nephew.  There was something on the menu for everyone. The atmosphere was amazing. There were all types of people there, and I really liked the food. I had the corn and cranberry scone and the American Breakfast and everything was prepared well. Plus everyone was really friendly which always makes things better.  I can't wait to go back and try their cinnamon roll.
I love this restaurant! Such a great fun atmosphere and the food is amazing!! You can't go wrong with anything you order! My favorite part of St. Francis are the employes!  They are all so nice and fun, and really add to a great eating experience!!
The atmosphere and food was incredible. The staff however was sub par to what I was expecting. Our waitress Christie was awkward and slightly rude. It felt like she was being nice only to get a tip. Other than her, it was a good experience.
Message test dinner at MNs suggestion. Cool urban setting.  Forgot I was in Phoenix.  Felt more like Denver or San Diego.  Pizzas and salad were stand outs.
