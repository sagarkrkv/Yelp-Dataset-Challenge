Four Peaks is an Arizona classic, with their Kilt-lifter and Hop Knot brands you can always rely on a special brand and taste.  I recently had the Peach Ale, a seasonal Brew with a clean refreshing taste.  Also their food is fantastic, so whether you like to old classic brewery or the new one in scottsdale, Four Peaks is a Arizona Tradition.
"Outdoor seating. Beer Flights. Appetizers and Entrees". . The perfect recipe for a good time out with friends. Some colleagues and I headed here for some connectivity and fellowshipping. The bad is the enormously long waits to sit outside and trying to find a place to park (NOTE: Look for the signs in the neighborhoods, as the majority is permit parking only).. . The good.. the service was fantastic, the appetizers were awesome, and the entrees and desserts did not disappoint. I discovered a new favorite - Peach Ale -- was awesome. Not too fruity not to light. Perrrfection. . . The food - oh man - smorgasbord of options. We had the 5 Layer Nachos, Brickhouse Wings, Arizona Chicken Rolls, Artichoke Dip, Salmon BLT (no bacon), and desserts. They were massive and tasty. Oh the Ice Cream cake did NOT disappoint and the Stoutamisu was an interesting twist on a classic.. . The service was super solid. Tables were always cleared, water full, and beer on tap. I mean overall considering HOW busy this place was, they really did execute on all aspects.
Great atmosphere at the Tempe location.  Great beer, pizza, and salads!
I went to this brewing establishment to get a refreshing home brew and they denied me service due to the fact that I was with a minor on a Saturday afternoon with my 19 year old brother. I wouldn't recommend this place due to bro like ways and asu alumni stereo types. They have great bar food and a good atmosphere due to good local placement in Tempe but to decline a group of paying customers due to age is ridiculous and I will never frequent the establishment again.
Best beers you can get in the valley.. . Kiltlifter, SunBru, 8th Street, Peach Ale you can't go wrong with any of these.
We ordered a flight, stout shake, burgers and stout a misu. Everything was very good.  The beers were well balanced, and we enjoyed all of them.  The waitress was also very attentive to our needs.
Make sure you visit the bar and shoot spit wads at the girl behind the glass wall. funiest thing ever. great 20 something to 30 desparates on the scene. little young sometimes but still holds down a lively atmosphere.
Chicken Nachos ( they do half orders) Tap Room Tenderloin, either of there two in house IPAs = WIN
Needs to turn on their fans for lunch dining area because its super hot in Tempe area. Overall, i like the music atmosphere is amazing. Customer service was okay but lunch rush hour was busy. Love the burgers! :)
Only stopped in for one drink, but like it enough to return to try the rest out!. . The atmosphere was great, you might have to yell a little bit to be heard, but that's part of the thrill of coming here. . . I ended up with a seasonal brew called Odelay! which is a delicious mexican chocolate ale. If you're worried about too much sweetness, then there are no worries with this brew. Get it if you are looking for a solid dark ale. . . Sidenote - Had I seen it, I would have gone for the beer sampler that they had. There were a ton of beers on the wood board and it looked delicious!. . My partner had the Raj IPA. For those who don't drink IPA often this was a smooth one. Had a little kick, per usual of the brew, but a nice introduction to what standard IPA's taste like. In addition, the appetizers were good, but I personally found them a little flavorless. Don't get me wrong though, they were FILLING. The calamari and the spinach dip were rich, and we felt pretty full after trying both of them. A little more salt wouldn't hurt though. . . This place loses a star for the service. Everyone was friendly, but our server was fairly unattached to our experience and stopped by three times total. . . Stay tuned. I'm definitely heading back.
I came here for a quick bite and a beer. It was pretty busy but my server was on point. I had a seasonal brew...a cross between an IPA and a wheat. It was delicious!  I am also a fan of fruit beers so I tried the peach ale. This one was not so good.  It tasted almost like flavored water.  Pretty odd.. . The food was great. I had the Chicken wrapped in Beer Bread. Yum!. . I will come back here again if I find myself in Phoenix.
The beer was delicious (The Peach was my favorite), the food was f*#!ing amazing (we had the shrimp and goat cheese bruschetta for an appetizer and the Salmon BLT), and our waiter was super cool and very good at his job (we had Jesse...what a badass).  It was the best experience I've had at a brewery in a long time.  I will be visiting this place every time I'm in town.  This is my new spot!
I cannot stray from the Chicken Enchiladas. I try each time, but they have sucked me into the vortex of yum. I cannot see past them on the menu.. Parking sucks, but that is to be expected in Tempe, especially an area that was not made for visitors back in the day. . Patio is awesome, staff is nice and they do not exclude children from interactions when at the brewery. They just do not serve them beer. . My kids wants to add that any hamburger you get is good, but mostly the Four Peaks Cheeseburger with added bacon (I would not know- Chicken Enchilada Girl).
A great, hidden gem.  Our friends introduced us to this place and we loved it!  Food is yummy, beer is great, atmosphere and patio seating are awesome!  Main downside is the location and parking, but definitely worth the walk if you end up having to park far.  . . I had the Hef which was delish and the Portabella Veggie Beer Bread which was so fresh and filling.  It was so good, but I couldn't even finish it!  Will definitely be back again!
I love the beer!. I find the food to be also good, but nothing panty-droppingly good.
Of course it's about the beer first. Cannot lose with a Kilt Lifter. Good pub type food. Fun atmosphere. Great place for a good time.
This is the most rude, condescending, disrespectful place one could ever imagine. The uneducated, arrogant people at the entrance should be fired! I have been there once and it was more than enough for me. Tonight my daughter 'attempted' to go there (her date chose this horrible place, and they were rudely turned away because 'her parents are not with her'...she is 20 and her date 23, they were going there as if they were going to Gordon Biersch or any other restaurant and were solely going to dine NOT to drink (obviously decent restaurants do check ID if a patron orders alcoholic beverages, this dump apparently refuses ALL service to law abiding young adults without even knowing if they even drink or not!) Nonetheless, the imbeciles at the entrance refused them entry. Instead, they ended up at Oregano's where the service, ambiance and cuisine are far above this dump of a place. Thank you for turning them away, you have just lost a remarkable amount of business!
Love the beer, and the food and service is amazing too! Great variety of food at a very reasonable price.
It should be no surprise that Four Peaks is getting a stellar rating from me. This is a staple in the brewery/restaurant scene for Phoenix. . . The Girl and I were meeting up with a friend. He wasn't going to be ready for awhile, but we were hungry! So we headed out a little early. It's a good thing we did, because there was a wait. It was actually one of the less busy Friday nights I've seen, but a wait is typical on a busy night. The wait is made significantly better by the fact that you can go in and get your drinking started by ordering from the bar. There's one little spot where people waiting usually order, which can be annoying because it gets backed up. But there are plenty of bartenders to get everyone served, and the TVs all around help pass the time too. After a little while (maybe 20 minutes, maybe a little more. I lost track) we got seated outside. We sat outside on the patio, which is always my preference. When the weather is nice it can't be beat. Plus the inside gets a little loud for my tastes.. . The Girl ordered Kilt Lifter. I went for a specialty beer they brewed up: a white IPA. It was excellent. I like beer in all it's many forms, but The Girl does NOT do IPA's. She took a sip and didn't even wince. The simplest way to describe it (and this doesn't even come close to doing it justice, but I'm trying to keep this review to a manageable length) is to imagine if your favorite Hefe and your favorite, medium-hopped IPA had a sweet, tangy, and citrusy little baby. I stuck with the white IPA for the whole night.. . We were waiting on my friend, so we ordered the Arizona Chicken Rolls to start. This really is a requirement when you come to Four Peaks. The menu is great overall, but the Chicken Rolls are hands down my favorite item on the menu. The "sweet jalapeno dressing" is perfect - a nice blend of sweet and spicy. I always order an extra serving of the dressing because I use so much of it. It's $8 for two rolls, and I'll sometimes make a meal of just this alone. Okay, I'll stop gushing now.... . We waited as long as we could, but ordered just before our friend got there. The Girl ordered the Tap Room Tenderloin sandwich ($12.5) with fries. She also had them put the onion straws and bleu cheese on the side. I was not feeling the typical sandwich and fries pub food that night, but Four Peaks did not let me down. On their special nightly menu (a few extra special dishes that are one night only), they had a perfect meal: a cherry wood smoked ribeye topped with poached eggs, served with cajun cream cheese mashed potatoes and grilled squash. The Girl enjoyed her sandwich, although she was very glad she ordered the onion straws and cheese on the side - there was a lot of it! There was a lot of bread (which is typical) so she didn't eat all of it. My ribeye was outstanding. Ordered it medium rare (like you're supposed to) and it came out perfect. Melt in your mouth excellence, and there was lots of smokiness to it which I really enjoyed. The mashed potatoes had just enough kick to make them feel special. I was a bit underwhelmed with the grilled squash, mostly because  the slices lacked any seasoning that I could taste. If you've got a dish with strong spice (from the potatoes) and lots of smokiness (from the steak), then plain-jane grilled veggies ain't gonna be quite enough. Just a little bit of salt and pepper helped a lot. I was definitely full and satisfied by the end of the meal.. . Eventually our friend did come and we had an enjoyable evening. The waitress was attentive and nice. She was very patient and still attentive despite the fact that we sat for quite a while waiting on our friend.  . . If you are at all interested in craft and local beers, then this place sets the standard for Arizona, in my opinion. There are lots of really great places popping up, but it's inevitable to find myself at another brew pub saying, "Well, it's not as good as Four Peaks" about something. Not everything, but  something. Four Peaks gets high marks in every aspect of the experience: atmosphere, wait staff, beer quality, food quality, and price point. If you haven't been to Four Peaks, you are missing out on a quintessential Phoenix spot. Go now!
Food is great, environment is great, and the beer is you know... Great!
Everything is delicious.  Hop knot IPA is the best and the Italian beer bread sandwich!
I've heard about this place for years from coworkers when they go to the Tempe area so I had high expectations.  The chicken enchiladas were great. I tried to ask the waitress a few questions about the beers but she couldn't answer and/or didn't care...not sure which so I gave up and decided to try the peach beer. It was good but not great. I would definitely go back and hope for a better waitress.
This place has some of the best beer in the valley. Typically when you are really good at making beer the food just kind of is what it is. At Four Peaks the brew is excellent and the food might be even better. One of the best places to eat and or drink at in Arizona. . . Cheers!
The Good. . Service was impeccable. You get your ID checked in the middle of the day, so you know they're serious about a dining experience for grown-ups only. Waitress took my order right away. Food was fresh and ready at my table incredibly fast. Unlike their Scottsdale location, my fries weren't tough and my bread didn't seem stale. They are efficient and stylish.. . The Bad. . Criticism still stands regarding a very unadventurous menu. It's for the most part very generic bar fare that has no go-to dish that screams "wow, we're unique!" You could at least have something that rotates like your brews do. Talking up beer pairings doesn't make up for that. Also, parking blows, but why are you driving here anyway? . . I know I sound really critical, but that's because I don't want the face of a local brewery to be some stick-in-the-mud on a culinary level. I don't necessarily get excited about this place, but service and atmosphere were outstanding, so my rating has to reflect such great management.
TEMPE, AZ: Four Peaks is the most reviewed, most revered destination restaurant by anyone needing a watering hole in Phoenix (and by the way, everyone in Phoenix needs a watering hole).  I tried two things from the late night menu that are most famous.. . Ambience and Service(4 star): They were very friendly and very chill, typical for a good bar.  The beer operation is mighty in here and you can see it behind the bar.  Lots of tables and patio dining.  Very low key, very casual.. . FOOD. . Chicken Rolls (5+ stars): Unbelievable.  Like an amazing spring roll with warm spiced finely shredded chicken and cream cheese on the interior, served with a sweet jalapeno cream dipping sauce.  I could feel the dopamine surging in my happy brain with every bite.. . Nachos (5 star): Also awesome, these nachos have been ranked as among the "Top 20" Nachos in the United States.  They are made by the blackened chicken they put all over them.  It's moist, delicious, and tender with a lot of flavor, packed with the abundant cheese and beans/jalapenos/cream on the side to keep the integrity of the nachos until you pour it all over the top.. . Head on over!
