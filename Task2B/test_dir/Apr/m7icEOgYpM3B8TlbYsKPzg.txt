It was very fun, but kinda short and simple. But overall it was a really good show. Made people laughed a lot!
Loved it!! Great show!! But, if you're easily offended, see another show. And, if you sit in the front, be prepared to be taken in as part of the show!! Definitely have to be open-minded, but you will have a great time!!
Very KOOL show!! What's funny is that a few people in our area walked out, they could not handle the sexuality therm of the show. I give it five stars and personally think it is my favorite Cirque du Soleli in Vegas.
We paid extra for the duo couches and were seated in a location where we missed 1/2 the show. We saw it with most of their backs to us. The show itself probably would have been better had we had the chance to experience it from a different location. It is NOT worth paying for the DUO couches if you are seated on the side of the stage!
First off, I received free tickets to the show from my grandmother who won tickets. I'm really glad she didn't see it, I'm not sure if she would have lasted through it. . . There are definitely a lot of cool tricks throughout the show and the host is hilarious. I think my favorite thing was with the swimming girls- it was pretty amazing all the stuff they did with out slipping and bumping into anything because it wasn't that deep. However I probably could have some without them being topless, but hey it's Vegas.. . There was more humor in the show then Anticipated, which was such a plus. The seats were comfortable and we weren't too close, but I could see everything and it looked like all the seats were going to be good.. . They have a funny duo that always interacts with the audience and calls them up to the stage. It gets a little awkward at times not that it's not funny, but that thought that comes across that maybe you could be next.
Whatever you do...... Do not waste your money on the couches in the front row or get seat towards the sides of the stage ( left or right) as your view will suck. I paid $296 for a couch on the side and the views sucked so much we moved to a lesser seat. The show overall was good, not the best cirque I have seen. If you can get the $99 dollars for 2 special,then this is a good show. (Don't go if you are a prude. This is a very sex oriented show)
Loved it so much can I see it again ?!?!? It was hilarious, I haven't laughed that hard for a long long time! It was sensual and made you say damn a time or two. I really enjoyed that there were bigger girls in the show but disappointed that they weren't utilized more... The women mostly had "dancer's bodies"  which is expected but if you really enjoy T&A then you may be let down.
SEX! Compared to the other family friendly cirque shows, this one is not for the kiddies. Honestly, this show is created for couples, love seats, red chairs, sensual themes. Definitely, for couples! Out of the shows I've seen in Vegas, Ka, Zarkana, and Zumanity, Zumanity is my favorite so far.. . Short Reviews:. Pros: . Great audience participation. Very engrossing acts. my type of humor, Edie the transexual hostess is hilarious. . Cons:. Old stage and theater. Might be too taboo for some people . . Here is a more in-depth review with spoilers:. . Water bowl- Lesbians swimming and bending in awkward shapes while naked in a water bowl. Cool. XD.. . Hoops- Beastiality. Not like that, there was a guy dressed up as an animal krumping on stage!. . Hand to hand- Man and woman acrobats. Very cool as the couple hold each other up in arms.. . Dislocation- I don't really like contortionist.... . . Aerial straps- A woman with bondage in the air making sounds of orgasm to show masturbation and S&M...  not bad... XD.. . Aerial silks- Most epic aerial silk ever. Flying buff little person was quite breath taking.Depicts a relationship between a normal sized woman and a shorter man.. . Aerial hoops- Didn't stand out.. . Rouge Cyr- It's always crazy when people spin around on the ground with hoolahoops. . . Dance on TV-  Four women and four men dancing on stage. Pretty much a strip show.. . Flamenco Dance- Epic man with his cape! I don't know how he walks around in stilletos and not break his ankles! Also, the two men fighting each other for the love of a woman was really cool inside of the stage. They resolved it with a menage a trois! ;). . . Strip tease- This is for the ladies... XD.. . . Overall, each scene was breathtaking. Edie really made the show with his dirty double entendres.  Also, the audience participation was hilarious, I usually find audience participation to be annoying at cirque shows but it was actually really funny here. Go see this show! You won't regret it!
Sexy, funny, and amazing! This show is all my wife and I have talked about since we got back from Vegas! It's 90 minutes of nonstop fun. They have a couple bars inside and I recommend buying the 32oz mixed drink so you don't have to get up mid-show to get another. I was in the front row on a love seat and was made part of the show. I got on stage and it was CRAZY with the energy from the show. After the show they gave me a free 5x7 of being on stage! I wouldn't miss this show if you're looking for a great Vegas experience.
Cirque du Soleil performances are already a bit more sexy than the average show, but Zumanity takes it to a whole new level. If you'll notice, most of the 1- and 2-star reviews are from people who called it "raunchy" or "gross" - umm, prudes! Do you research before you go to any show. If they already require spectators to be at least 18-year-old due to "mature content," you bet your ass you're gonna see T&A - and maybe even more. . . You still see the amazing Cirque du Soleil high flying tricks, acrobatic stunts, dancing, singing, and prop sherades - but with super-sexy costumes and adult humor. Would I see this show with my parents? Uh, hell no. But our group of gals enjoyed the show.. . As for the venue, there really isn't a bad seat in the house. EXCEPT - if you choose the balcony, DO NOT get the first row of seats on the balcony. You might think you're getting a great view, but the balcony bar will be in your way - whether you're tall or small - so pick the row just behind it. And unfortch, the ticket box office doesn't warn about this obstructed view. Secondly, floor seating and love seating does involve audience participation, so if you easily shy away from the spotlight, sit on the balcony. Oh, and go early for the pre-show. Kinda sets the tone for the night.
