The food here is good just the amount of food And everything came out hot. Service was better than some of the other places we have been to. .   We would come back here to try the rest of menu
My husband and I just came across this place last weekend and I must say although we waited 30mins to get seated it was well worth it. After a long weekend in Vegas we wanted to get away from the strip and Long behold....was the Egg and I. The service was good and the breakfast was delicious. They have the best banana nut muffin! We ended up ordering a few for the trip back home!
First time eating breakfast in Vegas off the strip....best breakfast in town! Got the Fender Pender, bf got the Flapper, everything was delicious! Karla was an amazing server, she made the whole meal even better :)
Good breakfast spot! Our waitress was Stacie and she was awesome!! Definitely try the banana nut french toast and the egg-cellent omelet... sooooooooo worth it and it'll feed 2 people no problem!
This place was so good. They have a wide variety of options, but went for breakfast based off the name alone. I got the Eggs Benedict Florentine. It comes with the crispest seasoned potatoes.  FYI. The portions are really big. I wish I knew that before I went here. I left so full but happy !
Wow! So we came to Vegas for a quick getaway. As we were leaving our hotel, our valet attendant told us to try this place for some great breakfast! Soooooo glad we did!. . Thee is ample parking and our wait time was like, 25 seconds. We were taken care of right away. We go super delicious coffee, beyond superb customer service, and a great atmosphere to spend a morning or afternoon to indulge in tasty breakfast food. . . Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!
Our first time and we will be back every time we come to Vegas. Excellent food great service. Huge menu and all good
I was not impressed with this place at all. Coffee wasn't great, but drinkable (similar to hotel lobby coffee). My pancake was not very fluffy, too dense. I ordered it with fresh strawberries which were cooked into it, but I would have preferred them raw on top. My boyfriend's skillet (the one with sausage and ham) was ok and was probably the best thing I tried there. His mother's bacon and cheese omelette was not very good and she ate less than half. The bacon they use for omlettes is the same stuff Taco Bell does... shredded little bits that tastes like some kind of pork, just not bacon. Her friend's bacon strips were extremely overcooked, dark brown and crunchy vs. crispy. The homefries were terrible. Just potatoes with A LOT of some kind of cajun seasoning all over. I thought homefries were supposed to be seasoned with salt, pepper, onions and green peppers... The one good thing about this place was the wait time. 10 minutes for a party of four on a Sunday morning.
Yum! Great place to get some great food! Big portions to fill your belly, good prices, and fast service! Carole Ann was a sweet and efficient waitress.. Thanks!
My experience was 5 star but admittedly that's not hard to earn from me for a breakfast place. It does mean I thought the food quality of my meal was well above average, aside from that it just means the atmosphere and service was plenty satisfactory or better. Would eat breakfast here quite often if I'm awake and not in the mood to make it myself.
Confirmed: the banana nut bread was AMAZING!  Buttered it up and inhaled it in about 2 seconds flat..........ok a bit of an exaggeration, lets call it 20 seconds.  Had one of their scrambles and it was pretty darn good too.  Would have given 5 stars, but the one thing missing from this place...........is character.  Like alot of other really good breakfast places, it is located in a strip mall.  Food is still great, location not so much.
Good for family brunch.  Great food for everyone.  . Super service by Alyssa!  Thanks for making our family trip so wonderful.   Alyssa, you rock!!!
It was our first time and we were impressed from the time we walked in, ordered our food and left the premises. We were greeted and seated right away. Sasha our waitress was fabulous. She recommended the ultimate skillet which was delicious. Steak and eggs was great too. You have to try the banana muffin, it is to die for. You can purchase a loaf to go. Fresh squeezed O.J. & their coffee was tasteful and yummy too. This is by far the best breakfast place to go to in Las Vegas. We will definitely go back next time. Great food and great customer service!!! Thx Sasha and The Egg and I staff. :)
This is as good as it gets! I ordered the steak and eggs with a banana nut muffin. The muffin was excellent, made in the restaurant. The steak was properly prepared as were the eggs. The potatoes were well prepared and not greasy. . . The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and clearly happy to be employed by this establishment. The waitress was patient and friendly outgoing and concerned about the service she provided us. The other patrons in the restaurant were professionals and a delight to be around. . . The restaurant was clean. The service was great!. . If you come to Las Vegas you should check this place out. I am going to return before I leave.
Great breakfast food and excellent service from Rea!. . Food came out quickly and was perfect. . . We'll be back next time we're on Vegas.
Omg this place is so good.... The staff is great too....my boyfriend and I were in Vegas for a few days and I will say that this was the best meal I had during the whole trip! You got to go here !
Erin was an awesome server. She helped my husband pick his new favorite meal. We love eating here. My daughter had a waffle
This restaurant had the best service on our trip. They made sure we were okay throughout the morning. Their menu was awesome with so many choices. I had the Huevos Rancheros with chorizo and it was great. I also loved their potatoes. They actually give a lot of food.. . We sat outside on the patio and the weather was great and the experience was even better for our breakfast.. . I would go here again or try their other locations hoping it's very similar!
This place is great. Omlettes, pancakes stuffed french toast its all great and they have something for everyones taste.  Our server Karla was awesome!  She described everything we asked about with great detail. I also like that they leave the coffee pot on your table so you never have to ask for a refill.
Super friendly service.. Huge portions.. Decent prices.. Delicious banana nut muffin (comes with most breakfasts).. My husband got a skillet- he really liked it, though barely made a dent because it was so big.. I got a crepe omelet. It was ok... Too much avocado (don't say that too often!). The salsa on the side was yummy.. Potatoes were good... Just lots of them!. Overall good experience.
I am really big into customer service and everyone here hits that out of the park. I do come here quite frequently and it never fails that I get excellent customer service. . I always get a coffee with only Carmel Macchiato creamer. (The waitresses never have a problem with my requests, by the way ask for Bre she's the best!) Than I always get the half order of chicken, broccoli, mushroom skillet, its awesome that they offer half orders because there proportions are already huge! They have awesome skillets!!! I also get a side of sourdough bread with apple jelly (once again the staff always gets it to me in a respectful manner)  . I don't have anything negative to say about Egg & I. I want to say thank you to this AMAZING staff. I truly feel like home there!
We were in the area early in the AM and decided to get some breakfast and decided to try the EGG ASND I. We had never been.. Breakfast is my fav meal of the day and I really like to get or make a seriously good one. . Wow, this one turned out to be great.. . First, we had this great server... Thaynara... She was sweet, understanding, and smart! She has patience while we figured out what we wanted to eat, so many choices!  YOU HAVE TO SEND HER TO SEE MICKEY!!!!!!!. Since we were 3, two of us decided to split the Works Veggie Benny... and Pumpkin Pancakes.. and the third party got the Chili Rellenos. . Everything was really good.. I always hesitate to get poached eggs since so many restaurants make them in advance and have them sitting in a water bath, so in the end either you get a medium to hard yolk or a watery mess.. these were perfect, the minute you cut into them the yolk spread everywhere, the spinach and avocado were raw not cooked to death and I just can't believe the potatoes.. They were spiced and hot and really good, and we had a  choice of potatoes or fruit and since we couldn't decided Thay suggested 1/2 and 1/2.. Perfect. . The pumpkin pancakes were moist (which I didn't expect, usually they are dry dry dry) but they were really good, like a good pumpkin cake (not pie).. . And the Rellenos were really good, not too much cheese (which I don't like) and he really enjoyed them.. All in all a really good meal! . It's 3PM and I'm still not hungry... Oh, and we tried the Banana Muffins.. we gobbled them up! . Even the coffee was OK.. . Definitely, will be heading back for more!
With this review I will say that everything is relative.  When you consider other options in Vegas for a good breakfast for a reasonable price, this is one of the best.  If you have read my other post you know I love chicken fried steak and of course that was my order here.  The steak was seasoned very good and had a lot of flavor.... really good!  I will be back to get it again in the future.  The gravy was good but not great in my opinion.  I really liked their breakfast potatoes as well as they were season with extra season and were better than I expected.  The eggs are eggs and nothing special there.  Also their banana muffin is really good.  It is a bit greasy and not for anyone on a diet but you talking to someone that eats fried meats for breakfast.
I really enjoyed this place! Great food and service! I ordered the fiesta skillet with chorizo, amazing!
This place never disappoints. The only thing disappointing is the long wait, which only means one thing. Parking is also difficult. It's definitely worth the wait. The banana nut muffin is a must. I think the menu was made for hangovers. Anything you get on the menu would mend it. The only thing on my last visit I had an issue with was my potatoes. They were really salty. It wasn't just my potato it was also with my group. Everyone's potato was salty. Other than that everything was EGGcelent.
I Love the Egg and I!!! Everything I have tried is delicious but I love the fenderbenders part of menu also Karla is pretty awesome!!!
Amazing breakfast and lunch! I've been here a couple times during visits to Vegas. Huge omelettes, great skillets and delicious sandwiches. You can pretty much order anything you want your way, even a custom made side salad if you want! If you're looking for a big breakfast in Vegas, you can't go wrong with Egg and I.
Summary: Every time, and I do mean EVERY TIME I'm in Vegas, I HAVE to stop by Egg & I for breakfast. I mean, I was offered free breakfast at Wicked on my last day there and yet I decline because I MUST go here. The wait at time is long especially on the weekend but if you are willing to be seated in the patio, the wait time is cut in half. I couldn't have ask for a better service from all their staff.. . Food: Waffle, Scramble Eggs, Omelets, Work Potato, etc etc etc. You just can't go wrong with whatever you pick. Well, you might but I haven't. No matter what you order, make sure you try their work potato, it's like country potato but crunchier with more flavor. . . Overall: Hate their parking lot, at times we have to park at the end of the plaza and walk over but it is so worth it.
Fantastic service from Thynara, the Brazilian waitress!  Amazingly delicious food, fast and friendly service.  I love her.  So far the best I've had to date!
Very friendly welcome and service by Thanayra, food excellent: Waffle works & sausage verygood, "half" pancake stack (half is a szrong understatement though...) but pancakes a bit on the heavy side, could be more fluffy, Veggie crepes with avocado fulling excellent, chili omelett really very good well spiced, i particularly liked their "works potatpes"...
We came here by default because the Pepper Mill had a 2 hour wait.  The wifey found this on Yelp, and we were so glad we came here.  Great breakfast food at very reasonable prices! I had the prime rib benny and the wife had the veggie benny. Both were delicious!  The wait was not bad and the service was quick.  If you're looking for good breakfast without going broke at the buffets on the Strip, I highly recommend this place. Way better than the Pepper Mill.
