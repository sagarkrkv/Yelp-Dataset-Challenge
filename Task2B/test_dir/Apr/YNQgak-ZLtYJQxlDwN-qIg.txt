Hands down my families favorite buffet in Vegas. Its worth the $38 if you can pack it in like us. We filled up on the crab legs and other seafood. I do wish they could lower the price for kids. My 5 and 8 year old were half price and only ate pasta and desserts. I'm still coming back every time I go to Vegas though. The food is fresh and high quality. The waitresses are nice and on top of keeping your drinks filled and getting your plates cleared.
I was very disappointed to experience such a poor quality and selection of food.. . the shrimp was okay, but all of the rest of seafood was marginal at best. There were no Alaskan king crab, only a third class snow crab.. The mussels were dry and flavorless.. There was only two selections for fish; snapper and salmon.. The fish was dry.. I went here thinking the Wynn might have a quality buffet, but I was wrong.. I didn't try the prime rib, so I can't speak for it.. Service was pleasant and standard.. one review suggests that vegetarians love this place,  I can't understand why.. The price was about $40.00. . I will go back to the Bellagio next time.
I know it's a buffet so I shouldn't have expected too much, but I did.. and I was disappointed.  . . The selections were pretty limited but they did try to hit many different cultures. I tried the prime rib, ribs, veggies, and other pretty standard things. Most of my party opted for the crab legs but thought it was too mushy. . . The dessert bar had a sufficient array of things like ice cream, small cakes, madeleines, puffs, etc.. . Overall, I don't think it's worth the hype or the price.
Amazing brunch. Loved the French toast, red snapper, and pineapple cup with rum sauce.
This is by far the best buffet I've been too in Nevada. People told me it was expensive but it was only $22 for breakfast and I thought the price was completely fair. The quality and assortment of food were both fantastic. My favorite thing being the pancake station where someone makes you fresh pancakes with your choice of toppings. It was at that point I fell in love with the buffet. Next time I'm in Vegas I will be back.. . My one complaint is what the hell if up with the outfits of the hostesses. They look like women's suits from the 80's. Tacky as can be.. . If you're not a cheap ass and are willing to pay more for quality than eat here.
Ok, so we all the know the WYNN is supposed to be exquisite, and although their resort is quite nice, their buffet "THE BUFFET" is maybe just slightly above mediocre.  My husband and I come to Las Vegas about every year for our "adult" get away and like to try many different restaurants.  We hadn't yet eaten anywhere at the WYNN and decided to give their buffet a try.  BIG MISTAKE.  I am not a picky eater, however, I had trouble finding food that tasted good anywhere on the buffet.  The food at their "Mexican" station was gross.  I am not of Mexican heritage and I make better food than that.  Same with the Italian station.  Just not really anything to brag about. . . I really wanted to like their food, and for the $50 a plate price I was expecting fabulousity on a plate, however, all I got was disappointment.  I will say, their desserts were good.  Not wonderful, just good.. . I would not recommend this buffet.  Go somewhere else.
I would love to give Steve Wynn an Internet ^5. However based on my experience dining in the Buffet at the Wynn, I will utilize this review for some constructive criticism with a few kudos. A combination that will accumulate in a 3 star review.. .   The Buffet at the Wynn is a dining area of elegant surroundings. I had the experience of dining in an indoor garden. It was an experience made better with seeing the sun as it shined through a glass ceiling. It was an experience supported through a $25 daily lunch price.. .   With so much investment in a luxurious interior, why was there so little in training? The service was mediocre at best. After the friendly hostess seated us, we kept waiting and waiting for a server. Finally we had to ask the hostess to send a server to our tsble. Why? In the Mirage, the very hotel that Steve Wynn created, on the spot the Cravings Buffet server asked what we wanted to drink. Ditto for economy buffets that include the Fiesta. Just like miso soup at the Wynn, the service was relatively nonexistent. It seemed that our friendly server was more interested in chatting with another server than taking care of our table. During desert, I had to walk up to him to kindly ask him for more coffee.. .   And the coffee is another area that constructive criticism hopefully could improve. When people are paying good money for a buffet, they appreciate when the server pours fresh coffee into their cup instead of a pot of coffee that had hot temperature challenges. To get to the chase the coffee fell short of the hot temperature and taste that I expected.. .   Further constructive criticism of the Buffet at the Wynn is numerous food stations with so few choices. The stations themselves are commendable.  They are Shell fish, chilled sea food, Asian, The Grill, American, Italian, Pizza, Seafood, Salad, and Specialties. But the selection is lacking. The most obvious example is the soup selection. There were only like three soups in the whole buffet. To my eyes it wasn't quantity over quality. The chicken noodle soup appeared to be mostly chicken and barely noodles. Where were the mushrooms in the Vegan Cream of Mushroom soup? Where were the soups that the people love? I would have appreciated if I could of chowed down miso soup, won ton soup, hot & sour soup, or egg drop soup. I was disappointed that I could find the standard buffet offerings like salmon but no shrimp or scallops. I could go on and on. But I want to address the point that each station had only a few choices, the antithesis of the Rio Buffet and when you get down to it a Feast Buffet. And my taste buds found little difference between the egg plant parmesan here and at the Orlean's Buffet. The small selection extended to the ice cream selection. I do not recall seeing gelato. I am sure that the common flavor of strawberry was nonexistent. And the scoop of the delicious capucinno ice cream was remarkably small at the same time of being a scoop short of the ice cream served at the majority of buffets.. .    I give kudos to some of the live stations. The Kalhi marinated steak was delicious. And I also thought highly of the shrimp and pork dumpling with garlic sauce.. .   The deal is that I work very hard for my money. Put it this way, I am not one of those guys that is going to drive out of the Wynn Ferrari dealership in a new Ferrari. But, sometimes constructive criticism goes a longer ways than the wheels of a Ferrari from a Wynn show room. With that said, in the near future I intend patronize what I consider better buffets on the Las Vegas Strip. Regardless I still give Steve Wynn an Internet ^5.
Its a buffet and I shouldn't expect more. While the selection was good I'm still not impressed. Only went again this second time because this is where my boss wanted to go while he was in town. Next time I'll try to steer him in a different direction.
It's was ok! I thought the reputation of the hotel would hold up in the buffet but it didn't . It was a step above hometown buffet. Pricey for what is it.
For the price you had to pay to get in, and the amount of time you have to wait in line, you would expect food that is really really delicious.. . The service is really nice here, people are friendly and come by you relatively quickly despite the size, so that's a plus.. . The food is really mediocre though. I tried a lot of the the food, and I was not too thrilled about the taste.  Some of the food that was tasty was: kimchi, steak, the ice cream, pasta, sliders, and pizza. A lot of the other foods were not too great.... . I would really advise you to try somewhere else instead of spending a lot of money here. If you want to eat at a buffet, there's Rock and Roll sushi, and a Korean BBQ (both all you can eat) about a minute down from Wynn hotel. . . Save your money, and try somewhere else rather than waste money on this place.
Wow. Great selection of food. Worth the price of admission.. . I got waffles, pancakes, french toast, scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, sushi, ravioli, carrot cake, peanut butter cake, tiramisu, pecan pie, and some ice cream.. . Don't judge me. It was my bachelor's party.
Overall a really solid meal.  Little disappointed on the variety this time as there wasn't as much that suited my taste as other times but everything there was great. It would be nice if the crab legs could be heated or the shrimp had a tad more flavor but prime rib was terrific, mashed potatoes were excellent and a bunch of other dishes were above average.  Good job overall again!
I heard good things about this buffet. I paid $80 for me and my bf. Well I was not impressed. There is selection, but the food is not that tasty. I'm comparing this buffet with the Bellagio that's where we went yesterday. The selection of deserts is limited. The meats here is not that good. The ribs were mostly fat. The pasta was not that good. My bf did enjoy the prime rib, better than the Bellagio.
I experienced better buffet, especially at Wicked. The variety was very limited in my opinion. The dessert was not as much as Wicked. I don't see why this is the best buffet, as it cost almost $40 for dinner, it's just a dollar cheaper on Sun-Thur vs Fri-Sat. . . The only good thing I liked was the veggies, but other than that, carving station was small, barely any chinese food, indian or greek. There was italian, but very very little. I think this buffet is more of a healthy buffet because they had a lot of veggies like salads.. . Dessert was snot great, it was either super sweet or just not good. I only liked the passion fruit tapioca, but discarded the passion fruit because it was too sweet. The raspberry cheesecake in a cup jar was good because it was light. . . I don't think you should come here if you're expecting larger variety. The flavor wasn't bad, but go to Wicked instead.
This buffet has great options for vegetarians and is a must for people who love desserts!. . When choosing a Vegas buffet, I was worried that most buffets cater to a crowd looking for great steak, seafood etc. I mainly picked the Wynn based on the dessert choices that I read about. I was definitely not disappointed in that regards.. But the food really exceeded my expectations as there was a lot of variety even for vegetarians. . . While I went in expecting a great variety of desserts, it was the quality which impressed me more. Most of the bakery items rivaled some of the best bakeries I have eaten at. The number of gelato flavors was a lot less than Wicked Spoon but the quality was just amazing.
Price and waiting time is only reason i gave them 4stars.. I been almost every buffet in las vegas.. My rating is below.. Win-wicked spoon-bellagio-rio sea food-paris-ceasers-paris... I can remember where i went but i will update when i remember.. I love their dessert bar!. You should try here!! Life time memory!. French Japanese Chinese american you name it it is there.. Fresh sushi and nice crab legs.. I miss wynn be there soon again! . . If u choose odd time after one hour after prior time u can go in early!
The Buffet at the Wynn is truly stocked.. You get such an enormous selection that you will fill yourself up to the brim wondering why in the world you are suddenly so hungry! I'm almost ready to hop into my car and go all the way to Vegas for some Wynn Buffet.. . Next to the selection, you definitely have artisanal chefs putting delicious contraptions together from behind the counter. I don't normally have a sweet tooth but the confections are hard to resist so do leave room for dessert.. . For the price, the selection and quality, it deserves all 4-stars!. . Enjoy!
It's hard to judge buffet spots, but I'm always excited to go to go to the Wynn.  Of the 5-10 times I've been here, this was my first time to go at an odd time, and it was a shift change.  We were slow to be seated, and the food seemed to be scarce.  At the most, I will say the food tasted like a juiced up Hometown Buffet and my main first plate I normally fill up on (or my money getter) was nowhere to be found, NO CRAB LEGS!!!!!!  My reason for judging with 4 stars though was our server was pretty good considering the amount of tables he had to tend to, the food I normally eat (crab legs) eventually came out (but I was on my desert run) so know that the Wynn normally is a better place to eat.  The main reason it fetched the 4 stars instead of what I felt like was a 2 star meal, was the desert.  This normally is my most wasteful part of eating, but favorite.  There was so much good to choose from, I just took one of everything.  Even if I personally didn't like the desert dishes, they were all great, and the crapes were the bomb.  Would I recommend this spot?  Absolutely, but I will say this, we found out there is competition in town, and I will be judging the next 2 this weekend that claim to be the better.
I can't give this place less than 5 stars. The service was outstanding. EVERYTHING was delicious!! Perfect portions for such a large Buffett so u can really "try" everything. They have a lot of desserts on sticks like brownies and marshmallow squares and candy apples! A large assortment of seafood kept my friend happy. I being a vegetarian, was pleasantly surprised at how much there was for me to eat. Usually we get jipped at buffets lol but I would gladly pay 35$ for the brunch here again!
This is the first buffet I have tried in Vegas, I just feel like it did not live up to all the hype. It was maybe an hour long wait at the door at 1130am, so we took the vip lane for $20 bucks each, that prolly then worked out to be $60 per person - pretty steep for the fare that they offered. It is more quantity over quality, and having said that sadly not as much variety. Plus points are that the desert bar was outstanding and service was good :)
Went for dinner, good tasting food but limited selections. For the price? Not worth it, you're better off at Bellagio's buffet.
The best thing I had here was the oreo cookie and cream dessert. Everything else was moderate. I made a call here to ask about the hours and the least they could have done was tell me there is a tshirt sleevepolicy but I wasn't notified. So when I got there I had to buy a tshirt just to get into an overly pretentious buffet. Customer service needs improvement by giving the overworked staff a raise, improve management, and recognize those who work hard and provide praises/rewards consistently.
Save some $$$ If you want only crab legs/sea food.. eat/pay @ lunch time closer to 3pm before they switch to dinner price.Seafood comes out @ 330pm.My family and I ate around 2:15pm and stayed around until the crab legs came out @ 330 it was worth the wait!. . *Before entering the line read the buffet sign for ages/price. example: if your kid can pass for an 8yr old: it's half price$$
hello this buffet was just okay the crab legs were split and cold but really good i loved them. other then that the food was good just nothing to brag about the salad bar was small, they had a different types of food areas but not much for the culture to choose from. the set up was weird, it was clean and beautiful place to eat, I like all of it, but just for the price you pay you don't have a lot to choose from
It's aightttt. Kinda pricey but good food.
Wow!  I showed up hungry, really hungry.  There was so much food that I doubted myself that I would be able to sample everything.  The quality of food was very good considering other buffets.  They had Asian, Italian, Mexican, BBQ, Seafood, healthy choices, unhealthy choices (my favorite), and more more more.  After the 4th plate, I had to wiggle and stretch like an anaconda eating an antelope to make room for MORE.  I was trying to get a new plate of food before they could remove my previous plate----I only managed to accomplish that once - only because a huge bachelorette party was seating.  Well........7 plates including ice cream and cheesecake.  I was not able to sample all the deserts, but I had to leave something to challenge myself in the future.  Next week I will tackle "the Wicked Spoon" - I can't wait!
After experiencing a buffet dinner back in LA, I finally have to admit that the Wynn buffet is exceptionally good. I was blinded by the lame tshirt rule and I am sorry for that. The Wynn buffet provides quality meats, grains, vegetables, and sweets. And I am thankful to be able to enjoy such a luxury.
I cannot give a buffet a 5, because it is never going to be 100% outstanding food. But for a buffet, this is the best one I have ever seen. The decor is like decorated like a French salon, bright decor, fresh flower and fruit center pieces, simply lovely. Their fruit, meets, typical breakfast foods were nothing exceptional, just typical buffet versions. What was exceptional was the lobster frittata, pepper jack hash brown cakes, the granola French toast, and the most amazing dessert buffet that I have ever seen! It was exquisite, every thing was in miniature, the tiramisu, ice cream cones, mini mouse Oreo cake, just spectacularly presented and tasty! Of the 3 buffets we tried in Vegas this time, the Wynn wins by a landslide.
Bordering near 3 stars.. . I had to wait like 6 years to finally eat at The Buffet at the Wynn!  And, wow, I ended up not being as enamored as I thought I would be.  I think I was spoiled a bit from other buffets.  Although maybe in their defense I didn't see the entire picture because we only went for lunch.  Maybe all the stops are pulled out for dinner?  I dunno.. . It was a lovely afternoon with the wifey and after the HELL that is parking on any Strip property, we were on our way to The Buffet.  Line was already sort of long, we waited about 25 minutes before paying to go in.  After being seated, it was off to the races!  I was too excited to wait for a drink order.  . . We approached the buffet line with a small crowd.  After the dust settled, what do I see?  A typical looking buffet?  Nah, can't be!  But overall, I was just not impressed!  What happened?  All the glowing reviews?  The heaps of praise?  I think my visit to Wynn's The Buffet came a bit too late, I really should have came when they first opened.  It just seemed so....average.. . There were glimpses of good things at The Buffet, but that's all it was.  Many of the items available for lunch would probably be par for the course at other buffets in town.  Cheeseburger sliders?  Check.  But the ones at Golden Corral are just as good, if not actually bigger.  Rotisserie chicken?  Check.  Come on.  Costco's in my opinion is good too.  Pizza?  Check.  Need I go on?. . I tried to pick things that I wouldn't be able to enjoy at other eateries, or things not typically available on a buffet line.  But a lot of it seemed BLAH.  I did enjoy the small charcuterie section of The Buffet - a number of cured meats, nice cheeses, crackers and breadsticks for sampling.  The whole ground mustard was delicious.  But really, mustard?  One cannot get full on that alone.  If I was in a tapas place or something with a cold one, charcuterie would be ideal.. . Trying to make a plate was a bit of a challenge.  So many of the things were just TOO familiar.  I was expecting more.  The salad section was pretty but nothing stood out for me to try.  The congee section was a nice touch, and actually looked cool.  But the wifey loves congee in almost any form, and she said the one here at The Buffet was bland, not much taste by itself.  The condiments on top didn't really save it.  She said the congee at the Rio Carnival Buffet was better!. . I'm a little upset on Wynn's Asian section of the buffet.  So.  Damn.  Disappointing.  Mr. Wynn, you have one of the largest stakes of casino property in Macau...how can you ignore us Asians here in the states?  Your people should know that Asians visit the Wynn constantly!  Your Asian section is not up to standards!  So little choices, and bad ones at that!  Yes, that day at the buffet there were a TON of Asian folks eating, and yes, they all congregated at the Asian section.  The Asian sections of other top buffets in town are much larger, with better quality selections.  The dumplings?  Tasted store bought.  The hand rolls offered?  Soggy and too spicy.  The sushi?  Very, very mediocre.  It's like the person making them didn't know what they were doing or didn't care.  Rice was starting to dry out.  Why try making Hawaiian Poke if it's not made right?  The portion was miniscule in individual dishes, and the flavor profile was way off.  I should know, I'm from Hawaii!. . I had to stick with the other sections of the buffet to get something to eat.  There were a few gems, the meatloaf with the pearl onions being one of them.  Can you imagine that, meatloaf the highlight??  It blew my mind too.  But sadly, this is how it was for me.  I was expecting much better, and just didn't get that.. . I heard at the buffet at the Wynn they have their own dessert ROOM.  Ooh, an entire room!  But again, we were severely disappointed.  Where are the fancy desserts?  I saw the candy apples but I also saw some kid who looked like he was about to break a tooth on them.  So I skipped that.  The gelato wasn't anything special, we can now find that at the local Station Casino buffet.  A lot of desserts didn't look appetizing or worth the calories.  It really all looked like mini desserts brought in from another local bakery that supplies other restaurants.  Left the dessert ROOM very sad.. . The service was downright lackluster.  Our server was only present at the beginning to take our drink order.  The entire meal we didn't get refills until near the end.  Totally irritating, especially since all we ordered was water and iced tea.. . For the price of $25.99 for lunch I felt a bit ripped off.  Really, I think it's overpriced for what you are getting.  The lunch at the Bellagio buffet is less and I think offers better choices.  At Wynn you pay for the ambience more than anything because it is a nice space with lots of sunlight.  I'll visit again someday (maybe in another 6 years) but next time will consider dinner instead in hopes of there being a more varied food menu.
