I have previously eaten at CUT and enjoyed their full blood wagyu, so I did have a high expectation for the bar and grill, and I wasn't to be disappointed. The service was efficient and warm with our server being quite a character. The steak main was cooked perfectly med rare with just the right amount of seasoning, and the charred crust was smoky and sublime. The accompanying potatoes would be one of the best roast taters I have had. The seasoned and crunchy shell to the moist and soft innards all made for a cracking side. The linguini also had well cooked proteins with a light sauce that didn't try to over power the prawns.. Wolfgang has impressed us again with well cooked food and great service, what an easy way to fill the stomach before seeing David Copperfield!. Food 8.5/10 service 9/10 decor 8/10
Food is pretty good here and the service is good too. While on vacation I visited WP in the MGM three times. Once with six family members, once with for family members and once by myself at 2am. Strangely I received fte best service at 2am. Each time I ordered the steak sandwich which was excellent (although a bit grisely). Not a great deal for $22 but not bad for hotel food prices. To bd honest, my visits with the family were a bit pricey ($300-$500) but the food was good and the service was pretty good too.  I like this place most for a late night snack after a long night doing Vegas type activities like dancing, drinking, and gambling (Ahhh the good life). Anyway, good food, good service, fair prices (for a hotel). 4 Stars.
I fully enjoyed my experience here.  The service we received was wonderful, the restaurant is kept, which I love.  It did take about 20 minutes before we got our salads, but it was smooth sailing after that.  My fiance and I shared the shrimp pasta, since we didn't want to eat too heavily before heading upstairs to party at Hakkasan, and it was just enough food!!!  Overall, good!
Horrible service!!! Bartenders were incredibly rude! One of the mangers came over to talk to us about the service and ended up talking to his employee in front of us. We finished our drinks and the bartender refused to take our bill because he said"we are young and wouldn't tip". We tipped the buser because he was the only one who did a great job! We waited around for another manager to discuss the issues! Do not come here! They do not care about service to their customers!
This place blew me away! The location was adorable in the MGM with beautiful decorations. The staff was extremely friendly as soon as I walked in. Each and every person that I walked past greeted me with a big smile. . Out waiter was extremely helpful in picking out drinks for my friends birthday and made us laugh more than a few times. And the bus boys were also very accommodating. . The food was delicious. TheChinese chicken salad thing was excellent and so were the pizzas. . The waiter automatically brought out desserts for my friends birthdays without me having to even tell him which was very very nice. And everyone said by to us as we were leaving. . Best service from beginning to end and great food!
We always eat lunch here every trip to Vegas. Truffled Fried chips are amazing. Service is good.
We tried the lasagna and linguine.  They were both excellent and I would highly recommend them.   Topped the dinner off with vodka raspberry sorbet drink that was just right!  The waiter was very engaging and helpful.  The only issue we had was the busboy was was filling water glasses was a little sloppy.
Let me start off by saying this place was packed! We had a 20 minute wait for a table but what do you expect it's Vegas & we didn't make reservation.. For starters we had crispy fried calamari & it was cooked just like I like it. Not too hard, but not to soft either. I squeeze the lemon on that baby & enjoyed it. Also, we ordered the iceberg lettuce salad with cherry tomatoes, red onion, and extra blue cheese dressing without the bacon. All the veggies were fresh & each bite was crisp & yummy! (I love to hear my salads CRUNCH for some reason) For my main course I had the meatballs & spaghetti with extra cheese on the side & it was to die for! I felt like & kid again without sucking up the noodles of course.  (I only do that at home) . Check this place out but be sure to make reservation. . Sunny
Pissed....its open till 6am...we got therebY 2:30 and we were told it was closed!!!!!! The one star was only because I can't give zero...very disappointed
Boyfriend and I came here based on Yelp reviews. The drinks (a margarita and a Moscow mule) were DELISH. We couldn't agree on a pizza so I ordered the spicy soprasetta, salami, and pepperoni pizza with fresh basil and he got the meatball pizza. Both were totally meh. The meatballs on his pizza had the weirdest texture - like Chef Boyardee or something. And my pizza was fine, but the meats seemed over processed. Maybe it was user/orderer error because the things that came out of the kitchen looked and smelled awesome. I'd go back but definitely order something else.
Sooo good!! Beautiful decor, despite being located inside a casino and without any walls. However, they definitely had a less than desirable bathroom.... . Decor:. Classic with a modern twist. Their bar was beautiful, and I adored their tableware setup. Although you are quite exposed to casino-goers, you don't notice it as the ambience is very good. . . Food:. I love bread...especially free bread. Thy give you tons of it! And they're different types (baguette, whole wheat, and even focaccia!), arrive warm, and with tons of butter.  I ordered handmade linguine with mushrooms, which was cooked perfectly. It was a huge portion and very filling. I love handmade pasta, so this was a huge plus. It's also nice to say that I've finally had the chance to try a restaurant by Wolfgang Puck!. . Service:. Great!!! Never once was my water glass empty, and our waiter checked on us several times throughout the meal. Drink orders were also timely. . . I'd definitely go again for the pasta. I'm not sure if the pizza was any good, as no one in my group ordered it, but I'd definitely go back for the bread too!! :3
Nice for lunch in the middle of the casino. Solid but not great. Tried the crab cakes, the ribs, the spicy ahi and the Caesar salad. $18. Glass of sparkling wine. On the pricey side, service was excellent.
The food was absolutely wonderful. I ordered a cup of their soup of the day ($6), which happened to be a beef and barley soup. This soup totally blew me away. The broth was so herby and flavorful, I couldn't bare to let a single drop remain in the bowl when I was done. There was tons of barley, good sized chunks of beef (but still bite sized), and some other vegetables in the mix. I kept eating it slowly because I wanted to make sure I savored each bite. I cannot compliment this soup enough.. My main course was the salmon served with potatoes, arugula and asparagus ($32). I ordered the salmon medium well, and it came out perfect. A light crunch to the outside, and tender, juicy meat on the inside, and it was seasoned perfectly. The vegetables were delicious and cooked perfectly. They had the right balance of tenderness with crunch. I paired the meal with a glass of riesling ($11), which could have been sweeter, in my opinion (I love the really sweet wines), but it was still a nice wine.. The atmosphere is pleasant, especially with the decor of the panes of leaves and flowers throughout the restaurant. The hostesses were pleasant and even pulled out a chair for me when we got to the table. Our server was also nice and helpful, and didn't forget anything, although he did give us the wrong check the first time (it was the check from the table directly next to us), he amended it quickly and with a sincere apology. It's a restaurant I would come back to because the food was just amazing. I could eat that soup every day for a week and I wish every piece of salmon I ever order would taste like that salmon. It was perfection.
Return lunch visit and finally tried the Chinois Chinese chicken salad.... Yum!!!. Would return again just for that. Great energetic service!
I had a crazy combination but it was great.  I had the calamari and an order of pancakes and no I wasn't drunk lol.  Both were so flavorful and great portion size.  It's also great that they are open all night.
This was a great night with an incredible dinner and a waiter who knocked our socks off. He was so attentive, as if we were the only people in this crowded and very popular restaurant. His name is Derrick L. Thank you Derrick for making our 26th anniversary so special. I'm a fan. :)
Really really like this place. This weekend I took my wife out to the MGM to see KA. It was to celebrate our 8th anniversary which is Tuesday. We wanted to find somewhere nice but nearby so we could enjoy our dinner before the show. Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill to the rescue. This is a great place! It is literally directly in front of the entrance of KA and the food is great. We had the Mesquite Steak Skewers for an appetizer and they were phenomenal. My wife had a pizza and I had the Lasagna. Both were fantastic. We finished the night off with a Chocolate Souffle which we great. The service here is also top notch, Sarah, our server, and all of the staff were friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be back. One of the coolest things we noticed is that everyone who works there welcomes you as your are coming in the restaurant and being seated. They literally go out of their way to say "Welcome." Then as you leave they thank you for coming in the exact same fashion. Little touches like this make the restaurant even better to visit.
awesome food and awesom service ! we had pizza and it was fantastic.. loved this place!
The grilled burger was soooo good! Beautiful restaurant and surprisingly good prices ! They have a kids menu which was great since we had our six year old. Daughter with us ! Excellent staff  and drinks !
The Chinois Chicken Salad, Chopped Salad & Soppresseta Pizza were out of this WORLD. That good.. . Nick at the bar was a bit dry and his cocktails were uninspiring.. . Otherwise, love this place and this menu.
Spaghetti sauce tasted like chef boyardee and $18 for 5 ravioli. Then we went for an actual dinner afterward.
April 27, 2014. . Vegas food after Hakkasan to see Tiesto!. The ladies and I ordered their Milestone soup and it was yummy. We ordered the calamari and fries and crab cakes....great food to sober up to!. . I LOVE VEGAS!
Fresh pasta dishes and the appetizers were yum(steak skewers and truffle laced kettle chips with blue cheese(get these), calamari was good but kinda salty), prices were fair for the atmosphere, cheaper than nearby restos like hakkasan, craftsteak, emerils, michealmina or Joel robechon's joints
Wow what a disappointment and a shame to Wolfgang Puck's name. . . If I were Wolfgang Puck, I would probably be embarrassed to associate my name to this restaurant. . . Appetizers were decent.. . Tuna tartar was a bit weird having sweet soy on too to create a syrupy mouthfeel.. . Calamari was calamari, nothing special.. . Crab cakes were actually quite good. . . I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs because how can you go bad with a classic right? Pasta was cooked well, but the meatballs were just salty balls. . . Friend of mine got the Rigatoni which was also salty. . . Is the chef tasting the food before sending it out?. . Our server was terrible and not attentive at all and the busser/backwaiter was more helpful and attentive. (Didn't catch his name, but is a local and the first time he gambled he said he won $300. Hope you read this) We were never asked if any of the dishes were ok. Had to wait about 15 minutes  until the backwaiter asked if we were all done and wanted the check. When the server drops the check he doesn't even say a word. No greeting when leaving from any of the staff other than who? Another backwaiter!!. . Manager that was wearing a bright red shirt doesn't care about anything except texting and using his phone on the floor. Doesn't table touch any of the tables nor have any idea of what is going on in the restaurant. He almost greeted us on the way out, but looked at us and continued to lean on the counter and continue his conversation with the hostess. Nice!!!. . Overpriced and service sucks for what it is. Sorry for the negative post, but I want my hour and a half of my life back..
