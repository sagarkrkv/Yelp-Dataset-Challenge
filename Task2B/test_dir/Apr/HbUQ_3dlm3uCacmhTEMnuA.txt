Amazing! There were 4 of us and we shared 2 steaks- plenty of food! We had a filet mignon and a sirloin which were both amazing cooked medium. The sides we chose were carrots, Maui onion and grits all to die for! The raspberry martini is sweet and a must have. The staff was also great and on a week day we called an hour before and got a reservation- highly recommended and came in here with high expectations!
Order anything... it's great.. . I have been there many times over the years.  It is my favorite steakhouse, second only to Pappas Brothers in Houston, now that Ben Benson's in NY is closed.
We love this place - we discovered it in December and have been back multiple times. The service is great, the food is really good (scallop skewers are PERFECT), and we love the build-out. We like to eat in the bar because we feel like we are floating over the gaming floor. High, high recommend!
Top quality steak. Had the domestic wagyu ribeye. It was delicious. I did sample a friend's wagyu skirt steak, which was really tender and juicy.Good appetizers and great service as well. Making myself hungry just thinking about it.
Tom oh, Tom... How do we "Colicchio" our other meals???  Would you come to our house?  My stomach would pay dearly for your services.  The staff was terrific, the food was excellent across the board.  Using such high quality of meat brings an air of unusually soft and flavorful mouthfeel to your palate.  I'm coming back... I think my stomach has already made a reservation!. Steve
The service was fine but the food was average.  I shared the porterhouse which was cooked well. However, it came already cut (which is something I'm not used to and don't like). The potatoes au gratin was not quite cooked all the way. There were a few layers of potato that was a bit crunchy. The eggplant side was delicious though.. . Craft didn't have the worst food but I left thinking, eh. The decor for the most part is appealing except the portraits of cows lined up on the walls which made me think that I was eating the steak of that cow so I find that to be in bad taste.. . The monkey bread dessert was delicious. . . The price was typical vegas price--about three times the amount it should be.. . Overall. I wouldn't spend my own money or suggest this place with so many other options in Vegas.
The best part about Craftsteak was their dinner rolls.  Hot, fresh, salty and perfect with a slab of butter.  Other than that, the steak and sides didn't impress anyone in our group.  I shared the Porterhouse for two and quite frankly didn't even end up finishing it.  The steak wasn't seasoned well and had bit of gristle and huge chunks of fat.  For the sides we went with the turnips which were just ok.  Everyone else ordered the surf and turf and weren't impressed as well.  Next time we'll have to go to CUT.
Ok, I can't expect that everyone here would be happy to see two young children in a fine dining steakhouse but the hostess facial expression just let me know just how she felt about them entering the restaurant. They definitely don't make you feel that welcomed if you have kids. I'm sorry but we were hungry and no mood to eat fast food. Out of all the restaurants at the MGM, this seem the least fancy restaurant. . . Anyhow, the steaks were delicious. My family member got the roasted New York strip and she said it was great. I had the hanger steak and it was pretty flavorful but a bit too salty for my taste. The pear martini was delicious although you pay $15 for a glass, I barely tasted any alcohol. The sides were spinach and the grits. The spinach was just typical sauteed spinach with garlic, however the grits were delicious. Very different version of mash potatoes. . . Service was good but so slow. I have gone to the craft in Los Angeles and it was not even close to the service and attention you get there. I, personally thought the environment was just a little bit too stiff.
An amazing meal! You must try the signature Short Rib dish -a very generous portion! Prompt seating, attentive service from table team and attention from everyone encountered. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant!
This was my first trip to Vegas since turning 21 so I wanted to go out to an amazing restaurant while I was there. I am a big top chef fan and wanted to try Tom Colicchio's restaurant knowing it would be awesome considering how high his standards are. . . I went in with high expectations to this dinner and let me just say that this restaurant surpassed my expectations. I can't say enough good things about my experience at Craftsteak. . . First, we had the chilled oysters. AMAZING. I wanted 100 more of them! If you're a seafood person like myself then starting off with these is an excellent choice. They are light and won't fill you up. . . I had read on Craftsteak's website that the lobster bisque was one of their signature items and now I know why. Wow. It was mouth watering. Hands down one of the best dishes I've ever had in my life and I've eaten some pretty amazing food. I was blown away. You can't come to this restaurant and not order this item. . . For my entree, I ordered the flat iron steak. It was cooked to perfection, no surprise there. I could have cut my steak with my fork; that's how tender it was. It was absolutely delicious. But what really blew me away was the risotto. I could eat that risotto every day for the rest of my life. They should put the risotto as one of their signature items if they haven't already. . . Aside from the spectacular food, the service was IMPECCABLE. Our server was so kind, so efficient, and just wonderful. Not only was our server terrific, but the busser and the person who ran out the food to us were so polite and nice as well. I've never had such good service before. We got drinks atthe bar before our dinner and the bartenders were awesome as well. . . Also, the ambiance is lovely. I loved the interior. . . I wanted an amazing dinner in Vegas and that was what I got an then some. Tom Colicchio has high standards as a judge on top chef and those high standards show in his restaurant as well. This was the best dinner I've ever had in my life and I cannot wait to go back and eat here again. It was a very expensive dinner but it was completely worth every penny.
This place is the best part of mgm grand, the lobster bisque is amazing. I love how they put the bowl in front of you with big chunks of lobster and then pour the bisque over it. It is honestly the best lobster bisque I have ever had. The filet was really good as well. Mm now I'm craving the bisque.
Great food...what else can you say about top chef, tom colicchio...service was out if this world...our waiter Marvin had a slick, smooth way about him that spelled class. We had the kobe tasting menu and holy smokes that wagyu beef is amazing...so much flavor and tenderness....off the charts...sides were awesome and the bread...OMG!!!!!!
Another wonderful meal here!  Probably my favorite steak place ever, they just do everything well.  Maybe it is a tad pricey but it is worth it for the care they take in their food!  I plan my meal around a few things: Lobster bisque soup, potato puree, cinnamon monkey bread.  Normally I get a steak but have some leftovers to save room for the monkey bread as I will tell you it may be the best thing ever! Great staff, great food, great dining experience!
This was my first time to Craftsteak but i have to say there food is really good. I was in Vegas for Sema show and my company took us out to dinner to this place and they said over whatever you want so i went with the 32 oz porterhouse steak. It was massive but destroyed that dish. It was like a man vs food meal. It has such great flavor and they gave me the bone marrow to such out of the bone it was delicious. . . I highly recommend this place its very upscale steakhouse. . . A little expensive though.
. My boy friends T-bone steak was amazing.. The risotto with peas may have been the high point of the meal for me.
If you have the money and the time I would definitely recommend the chefs tasting menu.  I went into it thinking it was going to be little bites of food here and there. It started with our maitre d' asking if we wanted an alcoholic drink.  I decided to have sparkling water (two bottles in total) which I later came to find out was 8 bucks a piece.  It was a good addition to the rich food but helped our final bill climb. I can't remember all of the items that ended up coming to our table but every one of them was substantial and oh so tasty.  The mashed potatoes are a must have even if you are just having a steak get the potatoes you will enjoy them.  The meats including Wagyu skirt, strip and lobster melted in my mouth.  The lobster came with a parsnip butter sauce.  All I can say was oh my goodness.  It also came with the potatoes I mentioned earlier, asparagus, wild mushrooms and a grain of some kind.  When dessert came out they had brought several different plates and I was expecting to get to pick one.  OH NO they all were for me.  Cheese cake, two kinds of ice cream, chocolate mousse, seasonal berries and the ever so delicious monkey bread.  By the time the bill came it was just around 400.00 including tip.  The experience was worth it for this foodie.  My full tummy felt like it was going to burst for hours after and was pretty uncomfortable even the next day.
The most I have ever spent on dinner and I say worth EVERY penny.  I had the most memorable and enjoyable birthday dinner here.  I'd say a must visit while in Vegas.  Go hungry!. . My boyfriend and I had the chef's menu with two cuts of steak.  Probably the best steak I've had in a restaurant.  I loved the presentation of the steak- in a skillet with the meat cut into strips with care.  The sides and starters were definitely not a throw away.  I think I could have licked the bowl of the lobster bisque.. . Then when I though we were done, the dessert came!  Came with our chef's menu.  In addition- they gave me a happy birthday monkey bread!. . The service was top notch.  Not a flaw and perfect timing from when we sat down all the way to dessert.  While the service was in teams...which I am not sure I liked...they really made sure we had what we needed and were enjoying it.. . Minor complaint- the chef's tasting menu was a little hard to understand when reading from the menu..but our waiter was very patient with us.  I am glad that we decided to order this!. . I am definitely going back to Craftsteak the next time I'm in Vegas.
I've been to a lot of amazing steakhouses in Las Vegas.. . Craftsteak just didn't do it for me. It's not that they served bad food (other than serving me a medium steak when I ordered medium rare), it's just that at this price point (about $200/person) it should be absolutely exceptional, and everything was just average. . . The only real plus to the place is the noise level wasn't over the top so you could conduct a little business during the meal without effort.
This restaurant was incredible. Great service and top notch food. You've got to try the lobster bisque. Unbelievable. . . If you like scotch this place is scotch heaven. It has one of, if not the biggest selections, of scotch in the western United States.. . Alexis was our server and she is a true professional and personable. . . Craftsteak is a must!
There are few times a restaurant is able to continue to out do itself year after year in service, food and providing a memorable experience -- Craftsteak is one of those restaurants.  . . We've tried other top notch steakhouses in LV and none have been able to beat this place. The food is expertly prepared, the servers are knowledgeable and friendly and you never feel rushed to open up the table for the next party. . . If you try nothing else, you must experience the steak tartare. It is mana from the gods!
There is stiff competition in Las Vegas for exceptional restaurants, and despite the crazy long walk back into the district of the MGM Grand, it was one of my all time favorite restaurants. . 1. Unlike many restaurants in Vegas, our reservation meant something and we were instantly seated, where a server was already waiting for us at our table.. 2. Very knowledgable about wine pairings and let my husband try a few to get just the right one. . 3. Plenty of space, so it still felt intimate, yet you could still enjoy the cozy yet modern decor (Edison lights hanging, are my favorite). 4. Food was timed perfectly between courses.. 5. My sea bass and his waygu filet were sensational, a party for your mouth. We had sugar snap peas and au gratin potatoes, which I am pretty sure we both wanted to lick the bowls.. 6. Superior service the whole way through the meal and created a very special night out for us!
I came here with a group of 11 guys while in Vegas. We were happy with our choice and thought it was worth the price tag. The service and atmosphere were great, although we all thought the cartoony cow pictures on the wall were a little unsettling.. . We were able to try a lot of things being in such a big group, which definitely added to the experience. The rolls we were initially served look incredible and tasted almost as good as they looked. . . As for sides, the Shiitake mushrooms and whipped potatoes were both mediocre and the fingerlings were bland. The potato gratin was delicious and creamy, and the broccoli was superb with unique seasoning. . . All of the steaks I tried were superb. I had the Wagyu skirt steak (a suggestion from the server), which was incredibly tender, moist, and flavorful. I wouldn't put these in the top steaks I've ever tried, but they were close to reaching that bracket.. . For dessert, a couple of us shared the monkeybread, which was like a cinnamon bread pudding served with ice cream. It was spectacular--probably the biggest wow of the night. Save room for this dessert!
Hands down the best dining experience of my life!!! From the second we got there the service was superb. Our table wasn't ready yet so we had a drink at the bar first. The bartender was incredibly knowledgeable and gave me a great glass of wine. Once seated the waiter took us through their menu point by point and made us feel very comfortable with everything. . . We ended up going with a tasting menu with the Japanese Wagu beef. It started with a salad tasting menu. Each was better then the last. We probably got full just on the salads!!! The next course was the beef with the sides. We got the New York Strip and a Filet. The sides were the asparagus, mushrooms, and the mashed potatoes. Everything was melt in your mouth amazing, including the beef!!! I don't think I've ever eaten a steak that good and I don't think I ever will. When dessert came we were almost comatose with the amount of food we had already had so we just took it to go and went to our suite and enjoyed it later. Once we had digested a little of our amazing dinner!!!. . A must go to while you're in Vegas!! Can't wait to try the Craft in LA!!!
