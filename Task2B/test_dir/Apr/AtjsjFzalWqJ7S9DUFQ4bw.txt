We were in a junior suite for a girls weekend.   Room and cost were awesome.   Staff gave exceptional service.   Hotel was In the heart of everything.  Only downer was the slow room service, due to the hotel being so full.   Also people next door were loud!  No sound proof walls here.   But hey it's VEGAS!!!!!   Sleep when you get home!
Great place to stay but as far as playing here this is not the place to play never have I seen anyone win here but to stay its a very nice place the rates are up there might need to bring out the savings
I honestly couldn't be happier with my experience at this casino.  It was clean and classy on the inside.  The restaurants were great (see reviews for Wicked Spoon and China Poblano), the shops kept my wife's attention, and the decor was great.. . I will redo my review when I stay in the casino's  hotel.. . My only complaint was that roulette had a 0 and 00, further the $5 black jack paid a 6/5 for a black jack.... cmon
First time here as a hotel guest. Ive come alot for the Chandelier Bar which is amazing just to even look at! . As soon as we stood in line at the front desk we were offered a bottle of water with a smile!!. The check in agent was efficient and friendly. We were early for check in and didnt know if we would be able to get a room. The agent was able to get us in right away which was awesome because we were only there for one night and wanted to enjoy as much as we could. . The room was amazing! The view with balcony, sap tub,and beautiful decor!! I wish we had stayed at the Cosmopolitan our whole honeymoon rather than the Wyndham. . Being such a busy and large hotel every staff member that we had encounter with was friendly and helpful. I would love to come back to the Cosmo if I find a good deal online or something
Very nice hotel, great rooms and nicely located on the strip right in the middle if everything.
I stayed here twice last year, once in a queen room and once in a king suite. They were both very nice rooms, but I prefer the king suite because it was more spacious and included a terrace. The staff at this hotel was very friendly and helpful, from the front desk & restaurants, to the gifts shops, I had nothing but great experiences. The food at wicked spoon was delicious and so were the shakes at holsteins! Of course the pizza at "secret pizza" is always delicious too and always fun to feel like your in on a little foodie secret when you walk down that little unmarked hallway to what was once a storage room and now turned into a tiny but wonderful pizza creation cocoon.
First and last time here. Always stay in true first class resorts and was thoroughly disappointed in this one. We booked a terrace suite with a king bed for my wife and I and because they oversold the resort they downgraded us to a regular room with two beds. They said we can upgrade for 125 per night to get what we booked. Totally unhelpful person at the desk who couldn't care less. If you are coming to Vegas there is no guarantee your reservation will be honored. And the management does not care.
The worst experience ever!!! We booked terrace suit w / king bed and because they oversold the hotel we end up getting smaller , regular room w/ 2 beds. I've never heard that anybody is being downgraded because of hotel's mistake. Second dissopointment in the first hour of stay was valet which was very casual and it took them more than 10 minutes to get our car. Because of terrible service and irresponsible staff we were late to very important dinner.  Never will come back!
I decided to spend my 30th birthday in Vegas and had my heart set on the Cosmopolitan hotel.  First, I suggest calling to make a reservation rather than doing it online.  The reservations staff will inform you of any specials- for example, I got 20% off my room rate because I was a first time guest! I'll take it.  I arrived at the hotel, and the bell boys (er, men) asked if they could take my bags.  I declined their offer, and went to stand in the check-in line.  The wait wasn't too terrible, and the person behind the desk left their station to walk up to us and greet us.  I told the staff 'It's my birthday!' (I blame the champagne from the limo ride over) and he found a better room for me, for no extra charge!  56th floor corner suite, with TWO bathrooms, one with a Japanese soaking tub, with a LARGE balcony (with two loveseats, one on each side) and a more than EPIC view of the Las Vegas strip, including the Bellagio fountains.  I always felt safe, and always saw security guards patrolling the hallways.  The casino and restaurants are beautifully designed.  The staff is professional and friendly.  On my actual birthday, they sent up a bottle of champagne with a card that said 'Happy 30th!' I loved my stay, and I never want to stay in any other hotel on the strip besides the Cosmo!  I was definitely spoiled and I will be back! :)
Never again. It looks cool on the surface, but when you actually have to stay here for a few days you realize its just not a good hotel. There are far better options in Vegas for the same if not less money.. . By far and away the worst problem in this hotel are the elevators. The card key access to all of the floors is a joke. It does not work half of the time, and you end up overshooting your floor as you bang away trying to get your card key to work. It wasn't just my key, every single time up the elevator I would see people having the same problem as me. . It's a nightmare. . . The rooms were not much better. I had a room with a couch and a king size bed, so not a low end room. In my room half of the fixtures & appliances had some sort of problem. For some of the lights the switch is just didn't work. The television set was hung with a noticeable tilt. Stains on the carpet and on the ledge. The battery in the safe died one night as I was preparing to leave, necessitating a 20 minute wait for maintenance. One night they did not change out all of the towels.. . If you are thinking about staying here, don't. Stay across the way at Aria, or next door at Bellagio. Not only are they better hotels but they have monorail service which is a plus.
Your seizure inducing commercial is LITERALLY one of the most annoying things to come on the TV, so much so that I had a sudden urge to pummel the idiot who made it in the face, upon realizing that is probably impossible, I actually took the time to turn on my computer, log onto yelp, and write this review, THAT is how irritating your commercial is.
We had a great experience here this week. . The restaurants, night life, pools and gaming is top notch.  Our room had a balcony view of the Bellagio 's fountains and a view of the strip.  Nice.. I really liked the video displays on the lobby columns and in the elevators.
I came for a concert at The Chelsea last night here at the Cosmopolitan, upon arrival there were issues with our tickets. The manager present, who I believe was named Megan, deserves the 5 stars I'm giving this review. She handled our situation with the highest level of customer service. The entire team she had there was very accommodating. The venue itself was perfect. We ended up staying at the Cosmopolitan, it is a place of class, glamour and quality. I will definitely be booking my next stay here every visit. Thank you Cosmo for choosing the best people to work for you, that can always make a difference.
Great new hotel on the strip. I can't speak for the rooms, but we were in the casino and Chandelier Bar. The bar is a must see if your ever in Vegas. The chandelier is multi stories high with bars on all stories. It feels like your drinking inside of a chandelier. Drink prices are reasonable and the gambling is decent.
Amazing. Stayed on 29yh floor east tower. A little loud, but it's Vegas. Great location. Boulevard pool is awesome. Secret pizza delish! Love it all and will be back.
I was really excited about this place especially since it's one of the cooler hotels on the strip. It was a free room too. When I got to the room it looked amazing... . . Then I spotted a wet stain on the floor. Then on one of the beds there was some hairs... . . Wtf. . I have never been so grossed out with a hotel on the strip and this is one of the newest ones. . . Really? Really tho? . . I called the front desk and they understood that it was unexceptable, but all they could give us was a $75 credit for food and drink... I guess... But I had to ask for that credit... If not they weren't going to do shit. . . Really disappointed... The outside was great... The inside was pretty whack. . . I wouldn't go back... Should have taken the free room at the Wynn
My wife and I checked out the blackjack while we were in Vegas for our birthdays. We found a great $10 table with a fantastic and friendly dealer. It was great until the table minimum was raised to $25 and we were up a measly $100. A troll or shill sat down next to us coming in and out every hand, betting at the last minute, trying to "trap" us into making larger bets while he was betting inconsistently. Think I'm paranoid? As soon as we got up to go to another table, he left and our blackjack buddies came and brought us back. What is it, 1980? We dropped $100 a person in the restaurant and $50 a person in the (awesome) Chandelier bar. So lame.
Gorgeous hotel with lots of places to sit, schmooze, booze and peruse. We did a small bit of gambling, ate at the Wicked Spoon, enjoyed the ambiance and loved the retro feel. . The shopping was disappointing-nothing that excited either of us but there are some other restaurants we will try and possibly spend a night or few here for something special.
My "bros" and I recently stayed here for a bachelor party.  I must say that this was the RIGHT choice.  Only so often in my life do I have the absolute bliss of knowing that after all the analysis, I ended up making the correct choice in every way.  . . There were 5 of us; we got two adjoining rooms each with 2 queen beds and views of the Bellagio fountains and the strip.  The rooms were totally comfortable enough for 5 people (and one night a few more, but that's a different story).  The hotel has some great restaurants, great clubs (Marquee is fantastic), and an epic location.  . . Sorry to put too fine a point on it, but there were absolutely beautiful, elegant, wonderful, amazing women, EVERYWHERE.  Hardly anywhere else in Vegas did we find such a dense preponderance of beautiful women.  As a pack of heterosexual men, this was important; and even though most of us weren't looking to "score", it invited the opportunity to meet some great people in a more casual way.  I do wish that there were some lower stake tables to kill some time gabling, however. .  . I'll leave the reviews for Cosmo related venues to other Yelp locations.  But to summarize, the places in Cosmo I recommend are: Marquee, The Wicked Spoon, and that little lounge by the check-in area - the guy there made Long Island Ice Tea that scream perfection.
Like all the strip hotels I found the Cosmo overpriced and overly large.  The rooms are nice, ours had a sitting area along with a full tub and huge shower.  There was a microwave, bar sink, minibar/fridge and a dishwasher (wtf??).  So the fridge is a minibar so you can't put anything of yours in it, so what's the point if having a microwave to warm up what??  There are no dishes, so what's the point of a dishwasher??. . The pools were overcrowded and small, and all they play is dance music so unless that's your thing. . . The cheapest casino table gambling I saw was 15$ a hand, thanks but no thanks. . . . Overall it's a nice new mega resort/hotel that's expensive.
Need a tesla HPWC in valet. Don't wait for tesla to buy you one. You are a casino, you make lots of money. You can afford to buy 4 of them. That's how you bring in customers.
Charles is the man!!!!! Seriously, great first impression!!! Charles pretty much set the tone of our weekend!! You rock dude!! . We got a Great room with a terrace, that made it soooo much better. The view & the fresh air of balcony was awesome. The customer service is on point here; from valet to room service, it is done right. Ill so 100% come here again.
A high-end, stylish hotel where people dress up to the 9's (some with just some crazy, outlandish outfits) just to walk around the lobby, and there is plenty of good people watching.  Service was good, room cleaning was great, restrooms were clean, I didn't smell cigarettes so heavily by the machines and tables, and I couldn't smell it all on the 2nd floor and on up so they have good air circulation and filtration.  . . Our room was fine for our party of 4, and we had a beautiful view of the Strip and the Bellagio waterworks.  I don't ge the see-through shower and the open air 'no privacy' restroom.  I did like the double sinks and plenty of counter space, toiletries and towels though.  The dull lighting makes it a little challenging to get ready and put on make-up, but that could be dealt with.  . . Taxis are easy to get at the hotel front.  The Wicked Spoon was decent for dinner and breakfast (you can get buffet to go too!), China Pablano was a hit with us, we had a blast at Marquee and thoroughly enjoyed the spa - awww!  :)  There is a little cafe on the 1st floor that serves decent cafe and there is a convenience store too where you can pick up water, etc. Overall, a good, fun hotel and with everything you need under one roof!  One day we literally did not see daylight until 6PM!  I can't wait to come back to Cosmopolitan!
For the last many yrs visiting vegas, Wynn was my favor since they opened. I had there at Wynn most of the times and few times in other hotel in the strip. So this time I got to stay in one of the newest hotel, cosmopolitan. Let me tell u, I love the hotel so much. The Terrance suites at 40 floors with view of the strip! Awesome!!! The hot tube in the room with view of the strip!!! Unbelievable and relax! Nice n clean room and big!! Friendly staffs, good buffet but little pricy. Oh... Don't forget to see the live band at night in the main lobby bar!  Now cosmopolitan just earn my favor hotel in Las Vegas
After a mishap with hotels.com booking our hotel for the wrong dates and providing terrible customer service, we were left frustrated and without a room at midnight. The Cosmopolitan was extremely accommodating and a supervisor, Maylea, made sure we had a room for the weekend. It was even upgraded to a terrace suite on the 57th floor with a breathtaking view of the strip. The Cosmopolitan took the time to call Hotels.com to notify that a refund had been made to them for the wrong date reservation.. . The hotel was absolutely beautiful and the staff went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. In the future, I will book my room straight through the hotel. Customer service is worth the little bit of extra money! Thanks to the The Cosmopolitan for making our trip one we will remember!
The perfect place for a quick Vegas getaway.  . . Decor/vibe . The decor is Great Gatsby meets a modern sleek and chic aesthetic. You can see the 1920's inspiration in the lobby bar, antique phones and stylistic patterns which is discrete between the gigantic led displays, glittering fixtures and interesting shiny objects. Like most things in Vegas it's one bedazzle away from a tacky Liberace nightmare but The Comsopolitan pulls it off making for a hip, fun and very chic vibe. It's perfect for an upscale but party-focused vacation. . . The Rooms. **tip**. The rooms facing the pool on the east side tower provide for a perfect viewing spot for concerts. From our 22nd floor balcony with had a perfect view of Haim. Even better we got to watch them rehearse which was like a free private show! This was all of our favorite feature of the hotel and the trip. The rooms themselves are of average size and decorated in an eccentric but chic fashion. The bathroom was very cool with a view outside the hotel and a hot tub and large shower. This being said the bathroom is not ideal for groups of women getting ready as the counter space is limited and there is a only a glass door separating the shower from the sink area. Full length mirrors are outside the bathroom so your can get ready in that area. . . Service. The service was impeccable. We got a free room upgrade and checking in was a breeze. They brought up several items requested with no fees. Even better upon checkout there were some incorrect minibar charges as we rearranged the fridge. It took less than 2 minutes for me to get the charges removed and checked out. . . Pool. This is the most disappointing feature of the hotel. The first pool on the westside was insanely packed. The larger pool, restricted to guests was also quite busy and we had a hard time finding 3 spots even on a weekday. The look is very chic and modern and unlike other Vegas pools I saw no women in bikinis and heels (who does that?) and no super obnoxious bro-fests. The cool in water lounge chairs were a wonderful novelty.. . Food. We had lunch at the Henry which had unreal sandwiches, literally one of the best Rubens ever. We had dinner at Scarpetta which was pretty good but I'm sure there are better in Vegas.  While I didn't get to eat at Jose Andres restaurants here, I love the Jaleo outpost in DC and his very upscale lounge barmini had the best drinks/snacks of my life so I'm sure e would be insanely delicious.  . . While we stayed for a very short time I felt we got all the glitz, glamour, sun and entertainment we needed without any of the drawbacks of Vegas.
My husband brought me here for a surprise anniversary trip. We normally stay at the Wynn or Encore. Why does it seem every employee we have encountered have a chip on their shoulder? We arrived to a roll away in our room. No big deal, call down and get it removed.  The guy comes to get it, and seems annoyed that we "no longer need it". Um, no buddy... theres 2 of us... we didn't request it. Their rooms don't have a usb cable for your IPOD, the concierges solution?  Go buy one across the walkway at the giftshop (and points). Pool staff seemed annoyed to be working today. Not one person asked us if we wanted a drink in over 3 hrs. Maybe they think we can't afford one?  I dunno. I saw them catering to the  pretty 20 somethings. . We're here for another 2 days on a prepaid trip... let's hope I can report better news on an update.  As of right now....I'm not too impressed with the lacklustre service.
Great room with a great view. Booked the one bedroom suite terrace view. I think I found a new home, IF, service gets better. Check in was pleasant, bellhop girl was great, and the head chef, Jason at the pizza restaurant with no name (hidden gem), was very nice, welcoming, and just made us feel at home. Room service attendant was very nice as well and friendly.. . Now, to the negatives...pool attendants at bamboo pool not so friendly when taking an order, I believe his name was jason also. No one came up to us to ask if we wanted another drink, and the one time he did, wasn't very pleasant. Concierge, could use some personality also. . . Saving grace, for four stars is the nice terrace room, and Chef Jason. If stay gets better, I will definitely  update.
I have stayed here 2 more times since.  The service isn't where it should be but it is slowly improving and I will give them an extra star for that.  I still feel the view from the balcony facing the Bellagio fountains is unbeatable for the price.  Also everyone should try to complete the Chandelier challenge that we made up.  3 drinks a level and try to make it to the top.  Stairs only, good luck!
Great casino, but very noisy rooms. I could hear every single car driving Las Vegas blvd. and the ambulances sounded as if they were in my room. Not sure why a new hotel does not have any soundproofing in balcony doors.
Our view was spectacular! Room 3799 east tower premier one bedroom with terrace. Well worth the $$$$. If you book through travel agent (cheapOair) the $25 resort fee is optional at the time of check- in. Resort fee includes fitness center, business office, local calls and internet. If you opt out, it's $15 per 24hours for internet. The east tower is on Las Vegas blvd, right on the strip next to the Bellagio. The west tower is a few blocks south of the strip. I think if you stay anywhere right on the strip it's subject to noise. People who want a quiet hotel should stay somewhere off the strip. I did not mind the noise at all. By noise I mean the street music, the Bellagio fountains, live bands in restaurants. Yes, I could hear all that from our terrace 37 floors up. At night it does calm down. Simple solution is to close the terrace doors. . . Do not touch anything in their mini bar!!!! Their items in the mini bar are on a weight sensor. If you move anything for greater than 60 secs you will get charged! We went to walgreens and purchased a few snack items and beverages thinking we can just move a few things out of the way and place our items in the fridge. Wrong! I had to call the front desk and beg them to credit me for the $8 chips and $50 wine. Thankfully, They did with no questions asked.
Summary: Yikes.. . So I read a whole bunch of reviews prior to choosing Cosmo and I also took into consideration my love for the decor when I visited the place last year (Casino only).  I figured that staying at the new resort in town would be a good idea.  I read about 100 reviews or so on Yelp and decided that the good outweighed the bad.  I also noticed that many of the complaints had to do with the music being so loud they couldn't sleep.. . So on to the review:. . I booked a 2 queen terrace view room for myself, girlfriend and her best friend and when we got there they were very friendly and accommodating and even upgraded us to a strip view version of the room which faces the Bellagio fountains.  We are now very excited and head up to the room.  1 King bed.  So while I know Vegas is a place where crazy stuff happens, I doubt a threesome with my girlfriend and her best friend is happening.  The view was GORGEOUS....fountain show every 20 minutes or so that we were able to overlook.  I called downstairs to let them know of their error and they apologize however they do not have any double Queen rooms available unless they downgrade us into a non terrace room.  Naturally I throw a fit with them on the phone and they say that they will correct the mistake and clean a room ASAP.  They ask we give them 3 hours so since it was about 7pm, we decide to go eat dinner while that happens.  11:30 comes around, and no call.   I decide to be proactive and reach out and they have no idea what I'm talking about when I call.  No one has been working on the issue.  The lady I speak with on the phone this time helps me out but says the only room they have available doesn't have the view.  So while its the room we originally booked, its still a downgrade.. . We get back to the hotel and go to get our luggage from the old room to find out the keys have been changed since they changed our room and have to go all the way back downstairs (a process) and wait in check in line again to get it fixed.  It is now 1am and we are all very tired since we worked this day and dealt with all of these issues and just want to get to bed.  We get to the room and everything is fine.....other than stains on the comforter (looks like old sweat? or makeup?) and rug that is torn up in certain areas.  We are too weak and tired to complain.. . People who complain about the noise will be glad to know that its been fixed, not a single chord can be heard in the rooms anymore and we found out why.  Supposedly Marquee listens to complaints because when we went to the Marquee club the next night, it was quiet...and we asked why and they said because after midnight they turn everything down to not disturb the guests.. . . Pool was a joke, its tiny.  Good luck getting seats unless you are the first one there or buy a cabana.  We had friends staying at MGM and joined them at their pool for most of the trip.. . No poker at the casino.  6-5 blackjack and x3 odds craps.  So its not even a good place to gamble at.  Unfortunately since I was staying there, I still gambled there so I suppose that is what they are counting on.. . I'm getting tired of typing as I am sure you are getting tired of reading.  I'd rather go start a review for the good experiences in Vegas.. . My opinion? Do not stay here.  There are FAR better options for the money.  Go try Venetian/Palazzo, Wynn/Encore, or even Mandalay Bay.
Great lobby with digital book cases and iPad signature system. The rooms are great with luxurious furniture and bedding. If you forget your toothbrush just call the front desk! They will deliver everything you need!
Great staff. Great food. Great service.  Avoid East Tower facing the Boulevard.  Way too noisy with the Marquee pool right below.  We were on the 35th floor and we're disturbed each night with party goers up till 3:45 am.  Otherwise,outstanding hotel
Bad service and rigged video poker.  AVOID at all costs.. . I love Vegas, not sure why there is a tiger in the bathroom but hey, its Vegas.  . . When I go I like to visit all the casinos and bars and play a lot.  I stopped through the Cosmopolitan and put $100 in video poker at the bar.  Ordered a drink and played a little.  The bartender asked if I would like a drink and I asked for a water and a drink.  I played for 10 minutes and no drinks.  I asked again and they seemed annoyed I was there playing.. . While waiting I switched games to video black jack and after winning a few hands I pressed the MAX BET button which in most casinos is 10X your minimum bet.  Well not here....  it is 100X minimum bet.  Damn you max bet...... . . When the bartender finally brought my $100 drink over I asked about the absurdly high max bet and he laughed, yeah, that's the take all your money button.. . I know I go to vegas to donate money, this is just sneaky and low.  So one star and avoid if you can.
I gotta say, this is one of the nicest places I've ever stayed in. The room was really clean, very modern and well kept. Most importantly, the bed was really comfortable and sheets were clean. We ate at a few restaurants and bars in the hotel and everything was good. Pricy but really good. The decor of the hotel itself is really beautiful, a mixture of chic with modern. My husband and I really loved our stay there and plan to stay there again for our next visit. Would totally recommend this place. Love love loved it!!!
We were a little nervous about trying Cosmo out because of some of the things we've heard. We're a married couple in our 30s and have pretty limited interest in being in a huge party hotel. In reality, we needn't have worried. While there were plenty of young beautiful around and the entrance to the Marquee club attracts most of them, the rest of the hotel and casino had a pretty typical Vegas crowd. . . Check in was super quick (3pm on a Wednesday). We were given the wrong key and didn't discover it until we made it all the way to our room, but when we got back to the front desk they were apologetic and fixed it quickly. Eh, mistakes happen. . . We were in a studio terrace with a fountain view. I always request the highest floor possible, but the highest available was in the 21st floor in the east side tower. When a hotel has 75 floors you feel like 21 is pretty low, but honestly the view was still spectacular. Treasure Island to the fountains and everything in between. . . The room was great. Spacious living area, king size (super comfy) bed, two flat screen TVs and a beautiful huge bathroom. The bathroom had a wide jetted tub and there was a separate shower that was almost preposterously large. Very clean with nice fixtures. . . A few weird things:. Everyone talks about the wet bar, and they should, because it's weird. There's a dishwasher but no dishes. There are cupboards for the dishes you don't have, but there's no dresser for the clothes you do have. At the end of the day, you just marvel and the silliness of it and put your clothes on the few shelves in the closet. . . The other thing that made me nuts was the lighting system. It's all or nothing. Say you get up before your partner and want to take a shower and get dressed. Sorry buddy, no nightstand light that I can turn on individually. Instead, every light in the place has to be turned on (and there are a lot of lights) and then you have to walk around and manually turn them all off except the one you want. . . One of the best features of this hotel is the balcony. We loved coming back after an evening out and relaxing out there watching the craziness of the strip below. Add to it the view of the fountains and you've got a real winner. . . The casino was nice, great decor, didn't feel too crowded, even on Saturday. We played blackjack for a few hours and the dealers were really funny, playful and knowledgable. . . We'll absolutely stay here again. Highly recommended!
I am a fan of the bars here and who could miss the Wicked Spoon?  One of my favorite buffets is in the Cosmo.  . . I would put the Wicked Spoon for a treat for yourself.  I enjoyed lunch here and for 2 people without tip it was less than $57.  I am sure you could enjoy that in food if you have an appetite.. . As for the bars I enjoyed talking to the bartenders upstairs and even the staff at the chandelier bar were talkative.  Kept me there for sometime drinking away.  Nice decor and modern feel here.
Nice resort if you like a lot of night life in your hotel, the disco club kind.  If that is not your thing then keep looking.  . . Nice spacious room and awesome shower. Even on the 62nd floor I was able to hear the partygoers at 4:00am which was kind of annoying hence the lower rating.  In addition, I thought it was a bit on the pricey side when you include the room rate of $340 and $350 respectively and then throw on a $24 resort fee and tax.  That said the location is fantastic and the experience is solid.
This hotel was AMAZING! Really can't say anything negative. The furnishings were impeccable and the service friendly (really liked someone standing at the check-in line to direct traffic). If I were to give a negative vote, it would be to the restaurants in the hotel. The only place that I felt was close to giving you your money's worth was The Wicked Spoon buffet. $27 a person. Free wi-fi, free entry to the day club, and don't get me started on THE SPA! My daughter recommended this hotel, and I really can't see a reason to go anywhere else!
I love how posh and swanky this hotel and casino is. The hotel lobby is very upscale, modern and I especially love the pillars that they have with ever changing screens - I'm mesmerized by the pretty flashing lights and colors. . . I admired all of the glitz and glam spread throughout the hotel and casino. I love shiny, sparkly things and the massive chandelier was dramatic and incredible. . . We stayed in 2 different rooms here: . . The first one is the standard room and it had a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain. The room was spacious, new, and clean. I loved the sexy interior decor, art, and the beautiful wallpaper throughout. Super stylish! There is no bath tub, just a large walk in shower with a floor to ceiling glass window view to the bedroom. You can close the blinds if you prefer privacy, or you can keep it open for a private show. You pick. . . We also stayed in the well appointed king terrace suite with a phenomenal view overlooking the strip and the Bellagio fountains. It was such an uber swanky room! The room was long and spacious with  a great big suede blue couch in the living room area. It also has a kitchen sink area with a microwave, mini fridge, and dish washer. It had a nice spacious closet area with a large mirrored wardrobe closet and a cushioned chest to sit. . . The king bed was separated in its own room with sliding doors for privacy. The bed was ultra plush and comfy. The sheets were soft and crisp - I slept like a baby. . . The best part was modern bathroom! Jack and Jill sink, a beautifully wallpapered private room with a toilet, an incredible separated bath area with a beautifully tiled standing shower with a floor to ceiling view to the bedroom and is also connected to a gorgeous and luxurious Japanese soaking tub that has a opening to overlook the bedroom and a large window that overlooks the Las Vegas Strip and the Bellagio Fountains. The tub was so tastefully done and the view of the strip in the day and in the evening were exquisite! . . I spent a lot of my time enjoying the breeze on the attached terrace. They had a nice patio lounge set in their sexy blue theme color. I caught so many Bellagio fountain shows, I lost count. I would say that the terrace suite rooms offers the best views of the fountain on the strip. That view can't be matched. . . Both rooms were well stocked with toiletries from Co Bigelow - I love their products! They are travel sized which is never enough for my long hair, but the staff was very friendly and accommodating and refilled my stock with however many I needed. . . They are very dog friendly - My dogs are not small, one is  over 40 lbs and the other is 26 lbs. Upon arriving to our room, they had 2 gift bags on the bed for my 2 dogs filled with a portable potty bags in a Eco friendly wrist case and also bags of treats. The doggy park (not really a park) but an enclosed potty area for them on the pool deck floor was very small and narrow but it did the job. . . They also have the best restaurants there! We went to their Wicked Spoon buffet for brunch and dinner. But I prefer their buffet during dinner! Many unique, tasty culinary options and their gelato bar is incredible. Secret pizza is so damn delicious as well! Love the thin crispy fresh out of the oven pizza. Expensive, but worth it! . . Last but not least, hotel guests can enter the marquee nightclub free without waiting in line, which is great since that line can be rather obnoxious. I'm not sure if it's always free or at a discounted price, but the night we stayed it was complimentary.
Cosmopolitan it's been a month since I was all up in that, and I still cannot stop thinking about you.  You are high maintenance and a total scene, you are young and trendy and therefore super immature, but you're the prettiest girl on the block (the strip) and you're worth it.. . I've done Vegas a LOT.  I've done Vegas cheap, borderline-homeless cheap, and expensive because someone else is paying.  I've gotten frustrated by staying in the wrong hotel and wasting money on cab fare just to stand in line at Drais, or chase the crowd over to Tao from Haze because we heard Leo was there, or simply get wasted and then lost, and then cry in the bathroom of the Bellagio.  I've also known what it is to be in a 30s/40s crowd as a 24 year old young woman and wonder what in the hell I'm doing at ANY lounge in the Wynn.  Who the F stays at the Wynn? . . So when I planned a Dirty 30 Celebration for my wonderful, sweet, demure blonde friend (basically she had VEGAS VIRGIN tattooed on her forehead the whole time) I knew we were staying at the Cosmo.  We weren't struggling with cabs and doing the whole barefoot scene down the strip with achy feet at 3 am.  We are settling down in the nicest hotel on the strip and letting the party come to us.  And by party I mean Rose Rabbit Lie and Marquee.  We'll have breakfast at The Henry, we'll wind down at Chandelier, and we'll always be coiffed and put together because we NEVER HAD TO LEAVE THE HOTEL.  . . I'll write a separate review for Rose Rabbit Lie because it was incredible and deserves a separate nod.  Best parts of Cosmo that I took full advantage of: . 1) free valet parking - if you are renting a car you want to stay in a hotel that isn't going to charge you an arm and a leg,  the Cosmo's free parking has got to be a glitch in the system, I felt like I was getting away with something.  . 2) concierge - concierge will not exactly discount you (especially if you are rude, I watched that happen, and honestly the price is the price people), but if you are friendly and simply want their help they will tell you insider-Vegas stuff about where to go, at what time, and where to avoid, they're also superb at getting show tickets and reservations.  We had our daily "resort fee" waived.. 3) the spa - Sahra spa offers $25 day passes which we basically owned for the 3 hours we were there.  I even sung in one of the steam rooms.  There are snacks in the room where you wait for your treatment, theres a cold mist room, a dry and a wet sauna, a gorgeous hot tub with a fountain, bathrooms have all the amenities, a gym and a gift shop.. . ROOM: The rooms are trendy and hip and vibey and teched out.  Our shower had a glass wall that made the view from the beds a LIVE SHOWER SCENE.  (We abided by the Honor System and kept the blinds down while each girl showered.)  (Or so this reviewer wants you to believe.)  (Just kidding.)  (Or am I?). . POOL: My only complaint is the Marquee pool (shitshow) and the Bamboo pool (the more private one) were both closed.  We had the Boulevard pool which looks out on the strip and was still a good time.  We just didn't have options and a girl likes her options.  . . MARQUEE: Was awesome.  Monday night is industry night!  It's a must!  We skipped breezily to the front of the line because we were key holders (guests of the hotel) and also didn't pay cover (there's a cover charge for girls? what is this miami? rude.). . OTHER BARS (Chandelier, Bond): Bond offers a free show constantly, whether its boys in suspenders on swings or girls with feather peacock tails standing on the bar, I even saw a guy on stilts once.  Chandelier is a gorgeous bougie lounge where I've never been known to wear anything other than a tiny dress and I've also never been known to receive a bill for any of the drinks I've imbibed.  High rollers welcome.  Spacious, trendy, relaxing, ornate, glamorous, it's adult disneyland.
