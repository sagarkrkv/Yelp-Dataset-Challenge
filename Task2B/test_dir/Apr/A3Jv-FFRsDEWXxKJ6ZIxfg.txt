One of my favorite places in vegas to eat. We have been here twice for lunch. First time was Christmas 2012. For appetizer we had the fantastic Duck Confit Poutine. it was so good all the way to bottom where there is more confit.. My daughter had the mac and cheese and son in law the fish and chips which the catsup was awesome homemade. I had the irish beef cheek stew which  I could eat 5 times a week and still crave it. it is so wonderful.  Service is good
I had high hopes of going here for appetizers and drinks before dinner and was very disappointed.  My brother and I were hungry and decided to give this place a try.  The menu was very limited when it came to vegetarian options for me, but I decided to order the soft pretzels.  My brother asked if the mini burgers or truffle fries were better since he was not very hungry; the server suggested he get both and would not comment further.  I asked what wines they served by the glass and when he mentioned there was a Malbec, I inquired what the price was.  The server quoted $9-11.  I said ok.  Our food arrived and the pretzels were a variety including plain, herbed and bacon/cheddar.  I told the server I was a vegetarian and he looked shocked.  He did replace it with another plain one, but the pretzels were rock hard and I could barely bite into them.  My brother enjoyed his mini pub burgers, but there were items on the burger not listed on the menu.  We were mostly ignored after we made it clear we were only there for appetizers.  We were sitting at a highboy table, with uncomfortable chairs.  I received the bill and was charged $13.50 for my glass of wine.  I didn't even bother to bring it up because I just wanted to get out of there.  I would not go back or recommend it to anyone.
We were incredibly disappointed by this installment from Chef Ramsay and we expected a lot more from a place with his name. It was very crowded, probably about 8 o'clock on a Tuesday night. They were out of at least half of the items on their menu, including basic staples like pies and drinks. Our server failed to tell us ANYTHING and overall was not very pleasant. The food runners were rude and sort of ignored us.. The food itself wasn't good- I had a warm chicken sandwich that might have been decent if it wasn't overwhelmed with Gruyere cheese to the point where the bread was soggy and the cheese was all we could taste. The rest of my party was only marginally satisfied with their food. The only good part of the experience was the nice interior. Maybe we came at a bad time, but. I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody. It doesn't live up to Ramsay's standards in the slightest.
We had a very good experience, booked a reservation through our hotel for lunch last Sunday, good time to go.  Our server was excellent, the food was very good.  I had the seared scallops, delicious.  The pricing was extremely high, even for Vegas standards.  $16 for a cocktail (London calling)? I mean, it was good and all.  My family enjoyed their food and beverages.  I would say thumbs up overall-splurge a little!
Grabbed a reservation early to eat before the Elton John show. While this was a great idea in theory, it still took 40 minutes to get our food and we ended up eating quickly and dashing out to make the show. It seems the food for other tables came out within 10 minutes of ordering before and after ours hit the table, so maybe ours got caught up in a rush.... . Food was average. Had the chicken salad sandwich and fries. There wasn't a lot of chicken salad and it was just okay. The fries were better. The other thing we got was the pub sliders and a side Caesar salad. Each of those were solid but not mind-blowing.. . Service was friendly. Seems like it could be a cool place, but just didn't hit all the marks for me.
We took a party of ten into this place, with high expectations based on Ramsay's excellence-demanding TV persona. We left disappointed with the bland food, high prices, and indifferent service.. . Between us all, we tried a number of items. After being warned off the chicken salad sandwich by our waiter, we had a couple burgers, a couple tomato soups, a chicken pot pie, an chicken curry dish - by far the best, and a ny strip steak. Rather than go through item by item, suffice to say that the food lacked seasoning, was generally overcooked, and did little to distinguish itself beyond meeting the requirements of what we ordered. . . Between the ten of us, with a couple sodas, one beer (nine bucks) and a couple glasses of wine, the total came to three hundred bucks. While this was not intended to be a "highlight" meal for our trip, it was still disappointing. . . Finally, I don't know what horrible thing had happened to our waiter prior to his shift, but his attitude reeked of indifference to the happiness/satisfaction of his table. (Although he might have done me a favor warning me off the chicken salad, who knows.) Given other reviews I have read here, our service experience was not unique.
This Ramsey location is very less formal than Ramsey's Steak at the Paris. The food was more on the pub side which is to be expected. Food, drinks and service were all very good. My wife really liked the cucumber cocktail. Disappointed there was no bread basket for the price.
Our first disappointing Gordon Ramsay experience, but I guess I should expect it to be downhill after the Savoy!. . We like GR because the food is simple, basic competent and delivered at a high standard. It was the basics that we're missing: fries that were oily and soft, oddly chewy instead of crispy. The pie samplers were OK, but nothing special and maybe a little runny inside. I've had better in good London pubs. The waiter agreed that when they are made in small ramekins, they don't cook quite the same. I have an idea: THEN DON'T FREAKING OFFER THEM!. . I will say the lamb burger was absolutely awesome! If the chips had been right, I would've added a star.
Pros: Shepard's Pie is out of this world! (would you expect any less here though?). -my burger was delicious. -mushrooms were out of this world. -decor was cool. -waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. . Cons:. -Expensive...duh (not as bad as I was expecting though). -the bar stools were a little too squishy (really not that big of a deal..). -the cocktails we had actually weren't very good...especially for $14 or whatever they were. . All in all, we were impressed!
Oh Gordon....where to begin. I've looked forward for so long to try this place out and the best way I can explain it is to think about the Price is Right song when people lose on the show......yeah exactly.. . We were in Vegas for opening weekend of the tournament and originally had reservations for Gordon's steak house but after conversing with our bartender a couple days prior he mentioned that pub would be better suited for a larger group. We arrived for our reservation after seeing Seinfeld and were seated promptly, after that its ALL DOWNHILL. It took over 20 minutes just to get water! When the server finally came over he looked confused and to be honest a little pretentious.  I would have expected this from his steakhouse but not the pub. Anyway we put in our appetizer order, calamari and shrimp cocktail, which came out in piece meal again not seeing our waiter this entire time. I will say the shrimp cocktail was the best part of the meal (that's why they received a star) but the calamari left something to be desired. Two people in our party ordered the prime rib and after specifically asking the server how it was given the time (it was 10pm) he noted that it was perfectly cooked and good to go, however what they received was a tough gray log. I ordered the tenderloin medium rare and it came out medium....at best, it was definitely more gray then pink. My one friend might have had it right just ordering a chicken sandwich!. . All in all, I was very disappointed by this place and can say that I will not be going back. The things that Gordon prides himself on, service and perfectly cooked food, were surely lacking.
Wow what a big disappointment ... Had the steak and ale pie... Taste was good but definitely not worth $23.00 for a pie the size of a cup of soup and besides having a crust on top I could have had Campbell's Soup Hungry Man... I left being hungry ... Go for the burger or another option ... Definitely not the pies.... It's a PUB you would expect the traditional pub pies to be excellent especially coming from Gordon Ramsey... Gordon your completion Todd English kicks your Arse at the Aria...  Not even a contest ...
Please go back to the original Fish & Chips!  Was at GR last night and was so disappointed. The fish appeared to be the same but greasy and the 'plank' fries were replaced with a mound of greasy,soft chewy ones and the mushy peas were gone!  The bartenders are a lot of fun but we certainly left hungry.  And the Scottish egg appetizer was not a favorite.  We'll be back so please make the change!
Awful! My fiance and I watch Gordon Ramsey on TV all the time we loved him. So we were extremely excited to try his place out! The high prices didn't bother us and the food choices were different. I had the lobster mac-n-cheese and my fiance had the shepherd's pie.. well my mac-n-cheese was very mediocre it was a bland gritty cheese sauce (I can make a better sauce at home) and the few pieces of lobster sitting on top tasted like they have been sitting in an ice tub in the fridge. Come on Gordon I know you can do better. Infuse the cheese sauce with lobster or something.. $24 for a cup of cafeteria mac-n-cheese with some defrosted lobster bits on top.. Now for the shepherd's pie. My fiance got violently ill the next day! FOOD POISONING! Never in all the years that we have vacationed anywhere (several times in vegas) has anything like this happened. The day we were suppose to leave to go home and he can't stop.... we'll you know no need to be graphic. He was so bad that we had to stay an extra night in vegas cause he couldn't be in a moving car. An extra night in vegas is not great when you are taking care of a very ill person. Needless to say we will never ever come back to this location and probably never go to another Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Next time we are sticking to Craftsteak (Tom Colicchio's place) now they know how to cook lobster.
Atmosphere was great, our server was fantastic, and the food was spot on! We went to celebrate my fathers birthday. Had the scotch egg for an appetizer that came with pickled Brussels sprouts and cauliflower which was amazing! I normally hate Brussel sprouts but I loved the ones they served. For my main course, I had the bangers and mash which was to die for! I definitely left full and happy! My father had the fish and chips and had me try some which was amazing as well. The fish was perfectly cooked and very moist and flaky. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! It's a bit pricy but definitely worth it! ^_^
Place is a joke.. . OK. So I have to go to Vegas on business fairly often and I've been wanting to get out to one of Ramsay's restaurants out there. I've never had the time.. This time my Wife went with me. So it seemed the time to head to one. We weren't in the mood for a sit down at 'Steak' so the Pub & Grille seemed a better option than Burgr. We are huge fans of the various Ramsay shows for whatever reason, and are quite familiar with his 'standards' as they would appear on either the BBC series or the Fox seasons. That all being said I felt like walked into an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.. . So we start with some wine, don't recall the vineyard. Then given the somewhat limited selection on the menu we decided go with some standards. My wife ordered the Chicken Pot Pie and I the Fish and Chips (knowing his standard on the dish). The intention was to share half both ways.. . TIME WARP: 1 HOUR LATER.. . We get the food.. . Firstly the Fish and Chips were just meh. I've had better and I've had worse, but certainly nothing to write home about. Fish was done well, nice big pieces. The chips were dreadful. . . On to the Chicken Pot Pie. Pffft. Nickels worth of free advice, go to KFC, or Marie Callendar's or hell just pick up a Swanson's in the freezer aisle if you want a better pot pie. I get it, a 'pot pie' can be defined differently from region to region and country to country but there's some standards. Majority of which we're thrown out window. . Here's what was presented: an over spiced chicken soup with rubber bacon chunks floating under pastry (which was actually the only redeeming factor). . . Clearly on the menu it states: Roasted Chicken with Bechamel. . While the chicken *may* have been cooked with Bechamel one certainly couldn't tell given it was swimming in grease water. 'With Bechamel' implies that there would be some sort of consistency to the dish there wasn't, it was just bad.. . So Sir, according to your own standards:. . A. the non existent staff that took 15 minutes to even come by. B. the hour wait for the food. C. below (far) quality and execution. . Please explain why I should take any of the critiques you've given to the many restaurants you've made public on Kitchen Nightmares seriously? Stones, Glass Houses and all.. . Out the door $100 including tip. Good news, I can permanently check off the desire to visit any of Ramsay's Restaurants.
I went here last night for dinner. It was mediocre from start to finish. We were seated at a high top table and the stools were comfortable but had no back support, so you want to eat and not linger. . . Their wine selection is abysmal and the server was so excited "about our many beers". Really? Maybe because I'm from Michigan and we have usually have at least 10-20 craft beers on tap. The beer selection was rather boring at the Pub and Grill and topped out at maybe 12 beers. . . I got the Braised Short Rib and while it was fall off the bone tender, there was nothing spectacular about it. It was simply atop some plain old mashed potatoes with a few undercooked carrots and parnsips on the periphery. Certainly not worth near the $40. I don't think I would ever eat here again. Not that it was a horrible experience but because there was nothing special about anything.
Piercingly loud! Smokey. $128.00 fish n chips x 2 n two beers! We took server away from his post watching gamblers. Next night Voodoos! 180 degrees!
Was a very disappointing dinner! First of all our server wasn't that great but what  made it a less than average dinner was the New York strip while it was cooked correctly it was way under seasoned and the potatoes where way overcooked. For those kind of prices and knowing that it is Gordon Ramsay I expect a lot more!
My wife and I went and was just ok. I had the Shepard's pie and was very disappointed. The potato topping was fantastic but the meat was not. It tasted very good but was very dry. I didn't want to review until I watched how Gordon made this on YouTube. After watching he made his Shepard's pie nice and moist. It was like they cooked the meat, carrot's and onions and didn't add the wet ingredients. His cook's may need Gordon to show them again on how it's made. Just to make a funny but true point, I make a better Shepard's Pie and I did it watching Gordon Ramsay;s YouTube video. . . My wife had the burger which I got a taste of and was delicious! I would have given a higher rating but when you expected the best Shepard's buy and didn't get it I just couldn't do that. Sorry Gordon.. . Prices, hey it's Vega's, nothing is cheap so that didn't bother us. Besides, you are eating in one of the world's top chef's restaurants so one would pay a bit more.. . I still recommend and will go back the next time I'm through.
This is pretty good, I got the fish and chips and they were just as I expected, which is weird because I was hoping they would be better than I expected, so I guess I actually expected better fish and chips? Yeah I did. The Server was awesome, bald white guy , wish I could remember his name. There is also a huge bar tender that works there, he's really cool. I like the "text me when my table is ready" thing they have there, it's smart. Beers are good, the price is high for the quality but the location is convenient...right in the middle of Caesars. I would go again maybe for lunch, not dinner, idk, I wish it was cheaper so I could try more of the menu. But yeah, if you're hungry and in Caesars go for it, but I wouldn't say you should go out of your way to try eat here. Done.
This place has great burgers and service.  This is one of the places that is great to visit when your in LAS VEGAS.  Check it out before you leave.  It's located inside Caesars Palace.
My husband and I went there for our first year anniversary. Too many negatives and no positives. When you bother the hostess by being there, leave. The place had about two other tables, our table had a bench seat. I sat on the bench, my chin hit the table, the hostess said oh that seat has a whole. She offered a chair off to the side but wouldn't be close to the table. Should have left, my husband changed seats. One time I was taller than my husband at the table. We ordered fried oysters, crunchy yes like pretzels, not good. Fish and chips were horrible. No flavor, greasy, and not crispy. Just pathetic. Went and had a slice of pizza at secret pizza shop, it put our dinner to shame.
Do NOT come here in a large group. The service is bad, comparing to other places in Vegas, and food is JUST ok. We came here on a Wednesday night with a group of 7 people. Gordon Ramsay plus some beer sounds pretty awesome after a long day of work, so we still decided to give it a try despite the not so good review on yelp. . . The wait wasn't too bad, we got seated in about 45 minutes or so. They do have a good variety of beer selection and other alcoholic beverages. I wasn't too disappointed at the drinks but was definitely disappointed at the food. . . 30 minutes after the waiter took our order, we asked about our food because the table next to us with party of 2, who got in about same time as us, already finished their food and left. He told us that our food is next on kitchen list (not exactly sure what this means). Then he came back again, he told one of my friend to choose something else from the menu because they ran out the dish he ordered. . . Finally when the food came, the order got a little messed up and the food only tasted ok. The fries had different consistency where some are too crunchy and some are not crunchy enough. When we get the bill, the 18% gratuity is already included. Not a good overall experience and it was too expensive for what you get.
Very great atmosphere had a wonderful bartender so much that we came back to eat and it was awesome food SPENDY but worth it! Thanks Matt for the homemade Sangria!!
Disappointed!!  35 minute wait, which was what was quoted.  Uncomfortable seating everywhere.  Service was about as bad as it gets.  Looks like Ramsey allowed some kids take over the place.  From sit down time to food delivery was 50 minutes.  That was for a party of 2 on a Monday night @ 9pm.  Requested steak medium well...but it was bleeding upon arrival!  The food tasted good, but just not impressed.  Total bill about $100.  Never again...never.
We had some dining gift cards to burn, and went here. The 1/2 pound lamb burger at medium cook was pretty good and the fries were great. Only knocking one star because I could have fared better with a lighter burger as a 1/2 pound is a bit too much for me.
Disappointing  . . I had the fish and chips.... . I was expecting a British Fish n Chips experience - sadly that was not the case.  The fish was a rectangular greasy blob...I had a couple of bites and couldn't force down the rest.  Chips were 'meh' just ok at best.... . I would rate this 1 star - but the staff were excellent.. . For what I got - fish and chips and a Pepsi ($35) it was totally disappointing.... . Maybe they are working out the bugs as it had only been open for a few weeks when I ate there - but I wont be back.... . Martin B
I ordered a Black and Tan and it did to even look like one. They didn't pour the beer right at all and it looked like a light colored Guinness. . The food was okay. Kind of greasy but still delicious. If you want to go to a Gordon Ramsey  place I say go to burgr so much better! But it all depends on the type of food you're feelin
If it wasn't for the long wait for our food and my lemons for my water I would've loved this place a lot more but I didn't especially when your with a group of girls who are hung the f over.. . Came here on Sunday around 1pm because Serendipity was a half hour wait (we should have waited). Got seated ASAP after checking in with waters but it took our waitress forever to get my lemons which she did not bring and it even took a lot longer for our food to come out. Not sure if it was her fault or if the kitchen was backed up but at 1pm the place wasn't busy at all. . . I ordered this salmon puree appetizer and it came in a small jar with 6 thick slices of toasted white soft bread. Really good for less than $20 and it was very filling because I only ate about 3 slices of bread. The bread was really good, soft and crispy even when it cooled down it was still really good to eat with the salmon puree or by itself. I really enjoyed it because it reminded me a lot like a lox and bagel without the capers. . . My two girlfriends got the lamb burger which they devoured and loved. I didn't get to try it because I don't eat meat but I did get to try the fries that it came with. I love fries so I already knew I would like it but I didn't know I would love it! It wasn't overly salty or oily and it was a thicker slice with the right amount of salt. It was so good just plain and it didn't need the ketchup dip. . . Prices are reasonable and it's located in Cesar's hotel right across the casino by the Forum shops. Reasonable prizes and big portions! Just be sure to wait awhile.
Came in around 3:00 pm on Sunday and although the food (we had burgers) was very good the service was less than stellar and very, very slow.  Waited 40 minutes and there were maybe 15 tables full at the time.  For the reputation and the price I would have expected more.  Also, watched a server drop two clean cloth napkins on the floor and set them back on the counter.  Now I didn't see her put them back on the stack but I didn't see her get rid of them either.  Just sayin' hmmm.
I decided to surprise my wife for her birthday with dinner and a show! The decor and atmosphere is a nice mix of classic pub and modern bar. The place settings and seating had a classic feel. Everyone at our table was very pleased with their food and the service was excellent. They even gave my wife a dessert for her birthday which was awesome.
As a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay, I jumped at the opportunity to go and experience one of his restaurants myself. I almost wish I hadn't as it has given me a jaded view of one of my culinary heroes.. . When we arrived, we were escorted to our seats and immediately brought water by a very warm and welcoming waiter. The menu was very broad and seemingly had something for everyone. Forwhat it was, prices were a little on the high side, but as we are on vacation, we ordered and that's where things began to slip.. . My girlfriend and I both opted for the chicken madras, my mum got the bangers and mash and dad went for the fish and chips. We were all waiting in anticipation to finally try some of Ramsay's British pub classics. The wait, however, was sadly much longer than anticipated. We clocked around 35 minutes sitting talking at the table before our food finally arrived. At this point, the waiter dropped the fish and chips all over the floor. Without a word, he cleaned the plate up and went back to the kitchen. We were waiting for 5 more minutes before our allocated waiter even recognised a plate was missing and no apology was given, simply a "at least one made it" when the second dish was delivered. . . The food itself was actually delicious from what I had, which is perhaps the only thing keeping this review above 2 stars. The curry had excellent heat and flavour to it and was warm throughout. The bangers and mash were a hit as well, although it should be noted that the sausages are 3 different meats, so if you're not a fan of beef, chicken or pork sausage, I'm sure they would substitute to your preference. As for the fish and chips, it looked good and had crispy batter, however, I had expected it to be more like chip shop style chips from the UK rather than French fries.. . I believe this place has potential to be great, but could do with some more training for the wait staff. I hope the next time that Mr Ramsay checks in to this part of his empire that he recognises the need for improvement.
Ya no, not impressed..... . I was seriously expecting better... The deviled eggs and lamb burger sounded so amazing on paper but was really just a disappointment on arrival. The deviled eggs were too vinegar filled and tasted like they had been sitting in the fridge for some time. I was expecting an extra kick of flavor from the burger but nope, just tasted like lambs and nothing more... I have neutral thoughts about the fries.. . Not saying this is a terrible restaurant but this is not on my "to return" list.
I don't usually dole out 1 star reviews but this place was really awful.  The signature scallop dish recommended by our server was small and below Red Lobster quality (think Shoney's or something along those lines), the chicken pot pie tasted like a frozen meat pie.  No joke, it was really lousy and the loud mouth celebrity chef should be ashamed to have his name attached to it.  It's a restaurant worthy of a reality show and perhaps that's the point because I can't think of a better reason to open a new restaurant in the middle of a busy casino that is so awful and completely overpriced for the poor quality food served up.  Service was equally uninspired, the girl that brought our dishes to us was flat out frightening and surly, our main server seemed completely out of it as well.  Overall we felt completely unsatisfied with our meals and ripped off even by Vegas pricing standards.  Yuck! Totally disappointing considering we'd had a great meal at Ramsay's BurGR two days earlier.  I understand that The Pub was supposed to be Gordon's outlet for serving up his own favourites so I can only assume he's acquired a taste for the fare he samples when he arrives on set at Kitchen Nightmares. It's that bad.  The decor was cool but.. that's the only thing thing this place has going for it... period.
Wow. Pitiful, pitiful meal!. . I asked the hostess if I could get a good Veg option and I was told "Absolutely I'm a Veg myself and I eat here all the time." . . We sit down and check out the menu. Uhh, no Veg! The waiter comes along and I ask him what options I have and he tells me there isn't much but he would check with the kitchen. He coms back with an offer from the chef to make a salad. Not the greatest option, but I'll take it.. . After a half hour or so our food comes out. I got a salad that contained chanterelle mushrooms and spring mix with a vinaigrette on it... that's it. My special salad sucked. It wasn't very special and I ate about a third of it. . . My wife had fish and chips and the fries were ok. The batter fell off the fish and was an oily mess and she said the Dog and Duck pub in Austin makes it better... This is supposed to be one of their signature dishes and it was a total fail.. . The worst part about it is when you see Gordon on his shows "fixing" restaurants he is always watching what comes back to the dishwasher to see if customers actually finish their meals. Neither one of us came close to finishing ours and no one said anything to us about it... . . I guess he doesn't hold his restaurants to the same standards as the failing ones that are on his shows.
My boyfriend and I had dinner here on our last trip to Vegas. When the hosted greeted us my bf asked her if we could possibly get seated at a booth. She told us that none were available at the moment but that one was just clearing and that if didn't mind waiting 5 minutes, they could clean it for us. We decided to wait. We got a lovely booth at the back of the restaurant.. . A waiter came right away to get a drink orders. He was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.. . I ordered fish and chips, and my bf got the lamb burger. Both were delicious.. . My only complaint was the price. $30 for fish and chips is a bit excessive, even for a Ramsay restaurant.
After a miserable experience at Maze in NYC, I decided to give Gordon's restaurants another shot because I am actually a fan of his. Unfortunately, this experience wasn't any better. When the waiter took our drink order, I asked for the Strongbow cider on draft. They were out...on a Tuesday afternoon. Gordon Ramsay's pub was out of English cider! Ok, so I asked for the pear cider...nope. They were out of that too. My lunch was pretty bad. I ordered the lamb burger, and when it came out, the bottom bun was already bloody and soggy...inedible. Yuck! I was actually surprised they had the nerve to bring it out to me. I tried to eat the rest of the burger and the meat was almost too gamey to eat. I know some lamb meat has that flavor characteristic, but this was bad. I've had a good lamb burger before and I can assure you this isn't it. All negatives put aside, my wife ordered the "spotted dic" desert and that was about the best desert either of us have ever tasted before. I recommend this place for that and maybe some cider if they aren't out. Stay away from the lamb burger, though. Ughh...
Don't even bother coming here unless you're willing to spend $100+ on a party of 4..  I'd give it 3 1/2 stars but I can't so 3 will do... . We got seated right away and I ordered fish n chips for $29 and the fries were nothing special but the fish was perfectly cooked. The calamari was ehh, there wasn't a lot of bread crumbs; it was like eating plain squid but I have no problem with that. The toffee sticky pudding was unbelievably gooooooood. Thanks to our waitress for the recommendation! :-)
We questioned the hostess twice about our table after being told 15-20 minutes...that was 45 minutes in. We completed our meal including dessert and NEVER got called for our table...AT THE BAR. I even asked the bartender if they are informed when people decide to eat at the bar instead of waiting for a table and was told no, they still would call you. Dinner was mediocre at best. My sliders were over cooked and very dry. My boyfriends scallops were decent but I guess we expected better for the cost. Beers are WAY over priced even for Vegas standards. Their signature dessert was the best part. Bartenders were friendly and personal. We both agree we would not eat here again.
Very disappointed...calamari was salty & Cesar salad had a bottle dressing not good. Overall food was average not worth the premium price!!!
Terrible! The calamari and olives were okay but the service, terrible, steak was overcooked and tough and the scallops were mediocre. Luckily though we did order the scallops because otherwise the steak wouldn't even have been edible without the sauce. Gordon should be disappointed. What a rip off.
I am not a Gordon Ramsay fan at all, but stopped in here because we were so hungry. It was fantastic! The pea soup was creamy and flavored just right. No dairy, by the way either - just the way I need it to be. Toast/bread was crispy and fresh and so good in the soup. We also shared the olives - amazing! And the salmon spread was to die for. Beers were cold and refreshing and service was very very good. We waited a bit between visited from our waiter, but that was okay. Very good.
My expectations were not high based on my track record of TV famous chef establishments and the reviews I read here before going.  . . Most of the negative reviews on Yelp! were due to slow, bad or non-existent service. Our service was fantastic.  The server was attentive quick and just friendly enough.  . . I had the lamb burger and my wife had the chicken madras curry.  My burger was perfect in every way.   It was medium rare, tasty and came to the table hot.  My wife's curry was a little more curry than chicken and tasted a bit too much like spicy tomato sauce.  . . The beer and drink selection was really good. I opted for an English porter which came quick and was still finishing it's cascade when it arrived.. . It wasn't great enough that I'd rush back but I would not stay away in the future either.
Went here for dinner during a friend's Bachelorette Party. The staff were amazing. We had made a reservation and were extremely late because we got lost several times. When we arrived, the place was packed and there was probably a 45min wait, which we had no time for since we had plans to attend a show after. The host took us right away after realizing we had a bride to be in the midst and did so with the biggest smile on her face! The restaurant had great energy, good decor and a was a fun place to hang out with my girls. I ordered the Goodbye Blue Sky drink to start, which was ever so yummy! For dinner I had the braised short ribs. They were extremely tender and the side of truffle fries were to die for. Last but not least, I couldn't leave without trying the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which I first saw Chef Ramsey make on Masterchef and I must say, it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. We got it to go and I ate it on the way to the car. My feet were hurting like no other, but once I took a bite of that pudding, all of my worries just floated away and I was on cloud 9. I will definitely be returning next time I'm in Vegas for this dessert. My meal was roughly $80, which is pretty steep, but it was well worth it!
Not so great !! Over priced food that would probably take you 15 min to make at home. And the waiter and waitresses look like they hate there life work there especially the hostess. Fish n Chips not good and not worth the $30. Lazy dogs fish n chips better.
While we love Chef Ramsay, this place is just okay.  Nothing to write home about.  It is in Caesar's Palace and therefore, way way over priced.  My husband had a burger, which again, was okay, but a whopping $19.00.  I had the chicken salad sandwich and it was fine, but I've had better.  We tried the "toad in the hole" appetizer, again, okay.  Rather bland.  It was a very expensive lunch; not worth the money spent and would not recommend trying it.  Finally, I just did not understand the "trendy" atmosphere, with the young women in strange "uniform", if you can call it that.  Yuck.
If you want real bad experience even after overwhelmingly spending, this is the place. My expectations out of a world famous chef's restaurant has crashed down to nothing after this experience.. . When you pay 25$ an entree and 15$ an appetizer, you definitely expect something nice out of it. The portion is so small that no one is satisfied after the meal. Even the taste is so average. After spending and expecting so much from a world famous chef's restaurant, if the food is bad, the feeling is anger and dissatisfaction.
