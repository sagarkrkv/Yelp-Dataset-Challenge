Spicy tonkatsu, add egg, extra pork and nori is my usual order. Love the pork belly bowl and kimchi fried rice here, as well. Place is small and there is always a wait. Well worth it though.
Finally got to try this place!!!. . Ive been wanting to try the ramen here for quite some time. Perfect hangover cure while in Vegas.. . I got the spicy miso ramen. I broth was very rich and flavorful. Portions are very good. I loved it. All of my friends loved it as well. The egg is cooked to perfection and the pork was perfect. One of the top ramen places for sure. . I will be back the next time I'm in Vegas. Place is very packed so expect to wait, but service is fast and efficient.
This place is absolutely delicious. I can't wait to come back here. It's a small little shop with not a lot of seating room so you might have to wait 10-15 minutes, but the food is more than worth it! . . I ordered the tonkotsu with flavored egg added in. The broth is rich and creamy, and has a great savory flavor. The noodles are soft and chewy - exactly what I was hoping for! It makes me think of comfort food, that's how yummy this dish is. . . You can order extra noodles to finish your broth up with but I couldn't bring myself to do it this time. The broth and all the fixings are really filling! . . Go here, get some ramen, and learn what this dish is really all about. Although, dorm room ramen will always have a special place in my heart.
This is a fantastic ramen house. I love places like this that have a small menu but what is on the menu is mastered by the chefs. I had the tonkotsu shoyu ramen with a side of kimchi. So, so delicious. BTW, you can get a refill on the noodles if you are hungry for $1.50 & just use what broth you have left over. Amazing place.
Tiny space and they get real crowded between 12 and 2.  Come at 11:30 or wait until lunch rush is over.
My friend invited me to Monta Ramen for lunch. Our food was very delicious. I had chicken noodles and gyoza. The service was very good! I will definitely be coming back here again!
This is definitely my go-to ramen shop.  I really wish the venue was bigger but I guess the size of the establishment is part of the charm.  I like adding the egg and corn to my tonkatsu, shio and shoyu ramen.
Always five stars, except when they are way too busy. The cold noodle is extremely delicious. Add some wasabi in it and it's awesome!
Ordered the tonkatsu and the shoyu Ramen. Well, this is a place u either extremely love it or hate it never coming back. The tonkatsu soup base is way too salty, as almost the chef dumped the entire jaw in the soup. Its very very creamy and thick. It's how Japanese noodle base should be like.  And it has a very strong taste of the pork fat. Many might love the thickness, but I am not a pork fan, so is a no for me. Shoyu base is just chicken soup with soy sauce, justsoso. Neither the thick wavy noodle or the thin noodle did the magic for me. I don't think I'm coming back, it's a good noodle place, just not for me.
Monta never fails!. . Great service and the food is always consistent. Being selfish, I only wish they had more side dishes... Eating at your favorite place there's only so much gyoza and fried rice you can eat!!
Want some traditional Japanese ramen? This place will not disappoint. . . Food: Excellent traditional Japanese ramen. . . Price: Very reasonable . . Service: Excellent prompt and courteous service. . . I highly recommend this place if you know your Ramen and know what to expect from real ramen. . . This will be my list of place to eat while I'm in Las Vegas.
Best ramen I have had so far!  We ordered the Miso and Kuro (Tonkotsu with black garlic oil) ramen and they were both amazing.  The broth in the tonkotsu was thick and tasty.    Noodles and pork were both perfectly cooked.  Normally I try not to drink too much broth because it's so fatty and unhealthy, but the broth was so tasty I drank it all.  . . The restaurant is small and the line can get long so be prepared to wait if you come in during the lunch or dinner rush.  The service is fast but don't come here if you're expecting to hang out for hours.  . . Highlights:  Quick service.  Prices are very reasonable.  About $8 to $10 for ramen.  Kuro and Miso ramen are amazing!. . Lowlights:   Lines can be long so be prepared to wait during rush hours.. . Summary:  This off-the-strip gem is a definitely must eat if you're visiting Vegas.  Go with the Kuro and you will not be disappointed!
Best ramen I've ever tried. Dishes are fresh and made to order. The place seems as authentic as it gets and is downright legit. If you are not interested in having pork, then don't bother. Definitely wish there some chicken options. The price is great and the flavor is just right. It gets packed, so expect to wait, especially if you are more than two diners. On a warm Vegas night, you can't go wrong with some cold noodles and an ice cold Japanese beer. The gyoza is also pretty delicious and comes out exactly as pictured in the menu...every time! One of my favorite things about this place is the spicy horse radish mustard that comes on the side. It is made in house and unreal. Was not a fan of the pork belly bowl, a little too fatty and more rice than anything, but it looks like a crowd pleaser. They also have some typical Japanese canned beverages. Place is super clean, kitchen is open for all to see, and service is both prompt and courteous.
Had the spicy tonkatsu ramen. Was awesome especially for the price! Best ramen in vegas
A perfect bowl of noodles in a charming little hole-in-the-wall.. . Service was welcoming, efficiently and friendly. When I read in some reviews that this wasn't the type of place you linger at, I was afraid that service might be a bit brusque. Nope! You get an enthusiastic greeting of "Irasshaimase!" from the couple of servers on the floor and the noodle chefs in the open kitchen behind the bar. Our server was courteous and we did not feel hurried. There's counter seating around the bar and maybe 5 four-tops in addition. It's not a big place, so there might be a wait if your party is larger than one or two. The AC was cranked up, which made for a very pleasant dining experience, considering you're eating hot soup in the desert.. . I loved the concept of standard toppings and adding what you want on top of it. I added the seasoned egg to my bowl, which had a perfectly set, slightly gooey middle. The tonkotsu was thick and cloudy, with plenty of collagen dissolved in the soup to give you that lip-smacking sensation. Noodles were perfectly chewy, although you had to slurp fast so the hot soup didn't soften them too much. They also have Sapporo on tap in schooner sizes. Perfect, because my tummy can only hold so much liquid. . . This is definitely worth a stop whether you are heading into or out of Las Vegas.
Monta is definitely the best Ramen shop in Las Vegas. I have tried others in Las Vegas, and yes, there aren't very many, but I have tried them. I also lived in Japan for 12 years and am half Japanese and for me, Monta is a part of home. Yes it's small but that's part of the charm. Don't expect to come here and spend a lot of time conversations with family or friends you bring either. It's a quick in and out type of place so go in knowing that and respect the line of people waiting to be seated. It has a very simple but good menu with the classicof any good ramen shop. Ramen noodles, with different bases, toppings to add and gyoza and fried rice are a must also. Enjoy! I come here often and have been coming here since they opened. They have tweaked their menu and recipes for the better. They have even recently upgraded their ordering to the mini iPad.
Good and to the point. What we needed on a cold windy day after a long days work. Ordered spicy miso ramen with a side of fried gyoza and a coke. The ramen was good along with the spice. On the other hand the gyoza was okay. The service was good as well, fast and courteous.
Please tell me what the fuss is all about.. . The first time I went there was with my older Son, who acted like a Japanese Cultural officionado. He schooled me in the traditions and culture of Ramen.. . It was just "ok".. . The second time I went with my wife. We were both disappointed. She is Korean and particular about noodle. I tried her Ramen, and wasn't very good. . . The waitress suggested a pork dish to me. I am pleased to tell you my dogs throughly enjoyed it, but I didn't it.. . I have to say the servers are very nice, friendly, and quite frankly, easy on the eyes. . . I won't go back there. . . By the way, my son ended up in the US Navy and stationed in Japan for two years. When he returned, I asked him if he wanted to eat here. He informed me that it would be like a hamburger gourmet eating at Burger King.
Not those packaged noodles you eat on the poor or ate in college (isn't that all the same?).   Fresh noodles with tons of combinations of extra ingredients.. . Pros:  Friendly staff. Solid food - yes it's ramen, but it's GOOD ramen. Reasonable pricing considering the portions are huge (bowl of ramen is the . size of a toddler's head and is absolutely full of food.. Community style benched seating around the ramen bar is fun - you never . know who your neighbor will be and you can strike up some interesting . conversations - or not! . . . Cons:  Closet sized - there's always a wait and it feels hot as hell in there.  Parking - it's in a strip mall that also houses the ever popular Raku Sweets so.  parking can get interesting.  Soda is only served in cans.  I'm a thirsty person and this gets to be an issue.  after the first two.  I am well aware that most asian restaurants do this and I .  understand that, but doesn't change my hope that I'll see something different.
Awesome joint. Expect a long wait because it's just that good. The pork belly bowl! The pork belly bowl! Yes it delish but the care taken with the broth is the real key.  Be prepared to meet new people because there isn't room to avoid them. . . If you are looking to camp out for hours avoid this place cause I want your seat!
One of the better ramen places and it's located in Las Vegas! This place is a must if you love Japanese-style ramen and happen to be in Vegas.. . I am a big fan and there's a real science about making that perfect bowl of ramen. The broth is essentially 70% of the main ingredients that either can make or break a bowl of ramen.. . Monta is well-known for their pork and chicken broth or the combination of the two. Had the tonkotsu ramen with thin noodles in pork broth included two slices of pork chashu, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, green onions and an addition of nitamago (marinated soft boiled egg).. . The ramen was really delicious. Even our Japanese colleagues thought the ramen was pretty good being in the US.. . This place is not very big so it can get rather crowded so expect to wait during lunch hours.
Hands down Monta has the best Japanese ramen in Las Vegas. I've tried my fair share of ramen places in Los Angeles and Vegas, and it's safe to say Monta beats everybody out of the park. The noodles are perfectly cooked every single time. The broth is perfectly filled with flavor but not too heavy at the same time. I love the thin noodles. I also love all their fried rice cooked to order and their gyoza appetizer. I'm not a huge fan of the 2 new ramen specials, but Monta never fails.
