VIP is the way to go. We skipped the entire line and went right in. Got seated at a big table right next to the door, and started cat daddy-ing right away. Crowd is a fantastic mix, there's some(thing)one for everyone, if you know what I mean. . . The rooms have mixed music. They started off the night with some great 90s hits, and we were tootsie-rolling it up. Good mix of music all around. Also, the upstairs patio is amazing, and you can dance against the backdrop of a great Vegas view. . . By the end of the night we were dancing on the couches and poppin' bottles. How the City of Sin should be done.
Pretty cool place I've been about four times... The dj is on point, the crowd is the normal  Vegas crowd that you would expect. Vip is the way to go if you can afford it. Someone in my group had a incident with a rude bartender but overall it's always a pleasant night there
Went with a bunch of girlfriends and had a great time! I'm not much of a dancer, but the people-watching was fabulous. The free vodka drinks actually had vodka in them, unlike another club we tried the night before. DJ was good. Bouncers and staff were good.. . My biggest complaint... why the f*** is smoking allowed in here??? There were almost no ashtrays which means people were dropping ashes all over the floor. Add that to spilled drinks and you've got quite an unsightly mess. Yuck.. . Note to Pure: please PLEASE update your beer selection. If I'm going to pay $9 for a beer, I expect something better than Bud/Coors Light.
Great club. Diverse crowd including age. Mature place where you don't have to worry about a shooting or "hood" crowd. Very sexy and sophisticated place. Free vodka drinks. Call early and put your name on the guest list to avoid lines. If you can spare a few hundred between friends get a table. It's so worth it.
Been here twice, and both times, I had A LOT of fun. Music is AMAZING. Love how they play music from the 90's and how they then transition to now music. . . The crowd is a hit or miss tho. Yes, the crowd matters to me. First time, there wasn't much of a crowd. Second time, perfect! We had bottle service, and I'm so glad that the other groups near us were super cool. YES to new friends :) lol.
