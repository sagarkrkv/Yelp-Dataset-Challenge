This place was a real shit-show when we walked in, but I'm glad we powered through.  It's chaotic and busy and you're in everybody's way while you're waiting in line.  Your patience will be tested if you're an impatient mutha like me... but your patience WILL pay off.  My most important piece of advice to you is to make sure you are in the correct line for the type of food you want... there are labels at the front of each line.. . These tacos are tremendous.  They are also very fairly priced, because although they're pretty small - they're also just $2.  I ordered 3 and had wished I ordered 6 (seriously, 6... they're not that big).  Worth a trip to the northern end of the strip for these, just make sure you have some time to wait.
I've heard a lot about this restaurant from my San Diego friends and I'm glad I finally got to try it.  The lines when we got there on Sunday at 1 was crazy but by the time we got our food and finished eating at 2:15 the line was just at the door. . . The restaurant has a interesting setup in that different lines serve only certain types of meat.  So the spicy pork is in a different line from the carne asada.  The tacos are typical small sized and most guys in our group had about 6-7 and I had 9. . . My Favs:. Spicy Pork. Lengua - tender but still has that tongue texture. . Decent:. Carne Asada - a bit dry and not as much flavor. Cabeza - slightly on the fatty side imo. Tripe. . Didn't like:. Pork Shoulder - I thought it was too salty and the meat was dry. Carne Asada fries
Who says there's no culture in Vegas? Been coming here forever and if you think Benihana and all you can eat Brazilian steak is culture, you need to get your gordo   trasero ( fat butt) down to the TEG! You'll feel  like you died and went to Mexico, only they speak english and are not trying to rip you off, just feed you most authentic taco you will find in Nevada. All at the taco  $ 2  store- simple menu, all for one low price, how nice is that? The 5 stars are for bein' real, the food is more like  a 4.. This place is seriously off the hook, as far as a basic taco joint goes. What you see is what you get, BYOB as well. The menu consist of essentially 2 things, meat and meat. Pork in a few versions , the Abodaba is killer,nothing like it anywhere I've eaten- plus the usual body parts cabeza ( brain) lengua ( tongue)  Buche  ( pork stomach) and asada, you can top off your asada with some silky nopal (cactus) all wrapped in their handmade tortillas.Tacos are very simple  meat, onions, guac, hot sauce and a white sauce I can't place that smooths the whole thing over sprinkled with a little cilantro. No beans at all. Be sure to try the different windows, one for pork the other beef. It's a bit of a pain, especially if busy, tag team it with  pals if so.. The attire and clientele   is all over the map ...tattooed chicas in heels and sparkle, hombres with cowboy boots, families with kids, dates, teens on skateboards, toasted college and other kids in town, locals and outta town tourista latinos of every sort..it's all here, under the red tent out front, sitting down at the stainless steel booths. Self serve order at the window, get your grub and pay before leaving. Right on the strip, next to the entrance to the Encore. Step right up amigo.
Asada (steak), lengua (cow tongue), adobada (spicy pork)...OMG! I don't even know what to say about this place besides "you have to go". It's GOOD!!! The meat is tender and flavorful, all 3 that I tried. The guy that made my tacos put on a little show with flipping the tortillas in the air and catching them. Plus he was cute. :-) And, on the spicy pork tacos, he sliced some pineapple which totally took it up another level. The salsas and sauces are spicy & tasty, and everything is so fresh! Please know, this is a hole in the wall, but aren't those the best after all?
Strayed away from the convention center and big name palatial casinos to take a break from all the overpriced nonsense and corporate types.  I felt comfortable at Tacos El Gordo, the service was fast, and the steak and spicy pork tacos were excellent.  I'm glad I checked this place out and am going to make it a place I come to every time I'm in Vegas from now on.
Good, it's not perfect. I wish the dining area was not as shabby. Considering it's location on the strip, I expect more. I hate having to stand in separate lines based on what I want to order The food is pretty good and I like sitting outside while dining here. Al pastor was spicy and I will be making regular visits for that alone. Maybe some fries as well. Really good, cheap prices.
The food here is amazing. Order Al Pastor tacos, sopes, vampiro, etc. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu and the prices are cheap. Come after the club and the food taste even better.
Got to come here every time I am in Las Vegas! Love the al pastor and asada, and all the fixing they put on their tacos. Also, a huge plus that it is so cheap!
11am opening time on a Sunday morning and it was already mayhem.  We were stuck in 1 line only to realize when we got to the counter that we could only order Al Pastor and Adobada in that line.  If you wanted anything else from their menu like Chorizo, lengua, quesadillas or carne asada fries, you had to line up at 1 of the 3 other lines!!!  Ridiculous!!!  It took me 20mins to get my order of 2 Al Pastor vampiros in my line and as much as I wanted to try the other stuff, I didn't wanna line up again, especially since I arrived the lines were even longer!  After you got your oders, you had to pay at the cashier, then squeeze to the beverage counters.  Dear Tacos El Gordo owners, obviously your stuff is good and people are willing to line up for it, but I really wish you would care more about customer service!  I wish you would implement an effective process where it's first come, first served, order what you want, get it then pay!  We are not herds of cows wanting to eat, we are PEOPLE folks!. . Moral of the story, come at an odd hour or come prepared... in a group of 5 people - 1 to save a table, 4 to order at each line/counter so all of yous can get what you want.  Or you can check out their other outlet at E Charleston Rd which may be less crowded.  . . All we had was the Al Pastor vampiros and the flan.  The flan was good, but I have a personal preference of the Philippine leche flan over the Mexican version.  This version is more dense, but still yummy and creamy.  For those who haven't tried Vampiros, try it!  It's a taco meets grilled cheese sandwich.  It's all your taco fillings sandwiched between tortillas and grilled so that the cheese melts and packs all the goodness inside.  The Al Pastor meat was exceptional, one of, if not the best I've tried in Vegas.  Very tender and tasty, the right amount of sweet and spices.  The cheese was melted and yummy but the tortilla they used was so thin that most of it was pretty burnt.  I preferred the tortilla they use in Taco y Taco vampiros.  We definitely have to go back for the other items on the menu! . . P.S. 4 stars for the food, 4 stars for service (helpful runners that ensure the seating area is clean), and 2 stars for the ordering process which is very annoying.
On point!... I always start off with the "Al Pastor" (marinated pork) tacos. Then get chorizo and finish off with asada tacos. Don't forget to ask for their grilled onions n peppers. Also ask for a couple tostadas to scrape off d the meat that falls off the tacos. And to wash it all down a large  ice cold Jamaica.. Everything is good from taste, location and price.
OK, it's not Nobu, no celebrity chef behind the kitchen doors and no fancy plates or tablecloths but this was the only place I visited twice during my stay (and can't wait to go back to). Nothing fancy, just Mexican families, bikers, normal people enjoying true Mexican tacos: delicious, greasy, spicy. And at $2 each, best value in Vegas!. To order you have to queue in different lines according to which tacos you want: one line for spicy pork, one for tongue, etc. and then bring your tray to the cash, pay and hope for a table to be available (or take your order to go). . Crowded at all hours so be patient! no alcoholic beverages, just sodas and "aguas frescas" (horchata is my favorite). My favorite tacos, it's a tough choice because all are delicious but I guess the spicy pork and tongue are the most special (the double tortilla is great, that way you don't spill the filling all over). . It's just a 10 min.walk from the Wynn/Palazzo/TI/Fashion Mall intersection.
Oh my Jeezus Lord! Tripa? Cabeza? Suadero? Lengua? Grilled Jalepenos con cebolla y nopales? This hole-in-the-wall joint is where it's at! I now live in SF and the one thing I had to let go of in SoCal was good Mexican food. So when I stumbled upon this place in Vegas, I was like oh, let's try it. And next thing you know, I was in the zone...In...The...ZONE! This girl was like "Leena, I can tell when you really like your food...you're really into it and it looks like your really like it!" Uhhh...yea! That was this moment. . . There are a bunch of lines so just go to the shortest one...I went to the older man because he looked like he knew what to do with a giant cow and a grill. Then you can speak to him in your broken Spanish and ask for errrything. I notice that the non-traditional folks ask for cheese and all but if you want it really legit, then all you need is their special salsas and cilantro. . . OH and I forgot about the spicy pork! So good, so good so good! I do like the fancy pants restaurants. But it's places like this where I'm like, why did I just drop all them dimes on that meal when i just enjoyed these tacos and they were just as delicious...if not more! ::sigh:: #foodieproblems. . Oh...but the drinks...I would suggest either BYOB OR a bottled beverage that they have....I would like to go back though and try their homemade beverages but as you can see, with 2 different animals and 5 different parts inside me, I was a bit occupied ;)
Heard a lot about Tacos El Gordo and had been meaning to check it out. I was on the strip over the weekend and figured it was the perfect time. When I walked in I was completely overwhelmed with the various lines of people waiting for tacos. It took me a few minutes of looking around to figure out that there were separate lines for different cuts of meat and that there were 2 counters on either side of the restaurant with the same lines and menu. You're supposed to order your food at the counters and then pay for it at either of the 2 register areas at the front (1 by each door).. . After looking at the menu for quite some time I decided to go with 2 al pastor tacos, because you can't go wrong with those, and 1 tripa or tripe taco. The al pastor was tasty, well seasoned and cooked, which made me glad that I got more than 1. The tripa was ok, not what I thought it was and it had an interesting taste to it that I wasn't used to. I also wanted to try the asada fries or adobada fries but will wait until next time because I'm sure it's a humongous portion judging by the price.. . Not sure why they have separate lines because the guy that was serving the al pastor told me that I could order everything at 1 station when he saw me standing in another line after getting my tacos from him. How nice of him for worrying about my tacos getting cold while standing in line :). . Seating is difficult if you come during lunch, just don't forget about the outside seating like I did. It was hard to find a spot that wasn't dirty or taken so had to sit at the table by the bathroom. Needless to say, I ate my tacos and was out of there!
Originally had this in the bay at the hole in the wall taco truck, definitely brought all the flavor to sin city.. I would give it 5 stars, but the guacamole was so bland. . Buche is a must
Super great tacos, carne asada and adobada. Homemade tortillas you can watch them making. Prices are awesome for Vegas and quality of food. Absolutely delicious, so glad to have stopped. Will be back as often as I can!!!
Expect to wait in line when you get to this spot as the lines go out the door. When you do get inside, understand how ordering works. There are two lines if your ordering a menu item for Adobada, two lines if your ordering Asada and just one line if you are ordering the Lengua, Cabeza, Sesos, or Buche. If your in a group, split up as once you get done in one line, you would have to wait in the other lines to get a different meat item but once your inside, you don't have to wait outside again in the long lines. Once you get your food, just pay at one of two cashiers.. . Now on to the food. I'm a big fan of the Adobada Tacos however it's pretty small and I think I would at least need four to six to feel satisfied. Asada tacos are okay. The carne asada fries are okay with meat, guac, cheese, and salsa but I think it would have tasted a lot better with chips than fries. Overall, I would go back again if the lines were shorter and just order some Adobada tacos.
I don't see what the fad is here...maybe I'm not drunk or it's cause I'm from SoCal so I grew up eating deliciously cheap tacos (for like 75 cents). I thought this place was ridiculous expensive for tacos. Sure, they puton a show, and it's a popular place for locals. I tried the asada, lengua and adobada. I thought the adobada was the most flavorful out of the three. The others, didn't really stand out. The food tastes decent (I'd give it 3-3.5 stars at most) but I just can't get over the price! (hence the 2 stars)
Yummy yummy in my tummy!!! The customers were super friendly to this girl who didn't know how to order non-spicey tacos!!! LOL The Asada fries are to die for!!!
Authentic Tijuana style tacos, fresh and interesting as it gets, go for the al pastor spicy pork tacos and buche "pork stomach" tacos.. . i try to avoid this place at popular times due to many rookies not knowing the process and it can get frustrating.. . other than that, its completely legit.
Overall: Greasy tasty tacos on the strip until 5am, yeah!. . Pros. - lengua, lengua, and more lengua. - adobado. . Cons. - Suadero. . Sidenote:. - lines are way confusing and crowded. - get everything on it. - horchata is not as milky. - if you are far, the cab ride is worth it. - So you're going to order (insert number here) tacos? Now add 4-5 more.
This place is ok, but I'm giving it 2 stars because of the set up which makes this place not worth going. The lines are extremely long. So you will stand there for an hour plus waiting. There are 3 different stations that you can line up for which serve different meats. The problem is that once you are lined up for one station there is no way you can go to the next station unless you get in line for that one which is another long wait. So if you are coming in groups each person can be split into different stations. Another thing these tacos are good but they are very greasy i couldnt eat as many because of the grease. Another thing is that those poor workers are so overworked. I feel sorry for them. They need more people, you see them in hypermode. I think unfair working conditions.  Not going back.
Best tacos in Vegas!! Nuff said!!!
Tostados asada was good..didn't get the lengua since it was my first time didn't know how to order. It's super crunchy, some burnt edges, but still good. I wished they gave more sauce or have bottles readily available for people. I wasn't aware until I saw folks asking for it. I didn't want to stand in line again for sauce. I'm sure you can go up and ask for them.. . The asada tacos were not bad, just dry and really in need of sauce. The bbq pork was not my favorite. It comes in two corn tortillas because of the wetness and grease. . . I'd like to try the chorizo or quesidilla  next time as it looked good. . . There's limes and radishes (whole and sliced) for you to choose from. . . 5 tacos and tostados were $12 not bad...would come back. I want to try the lengua but wished the line was shorter...
If you have a local taco stand, they are probably just as good. At least you wont have to wait in multiple lines for 40+ minutes for 3 tacos (and that is if you picked the right line). It's good food, but not memorable for the wrong reasons.
Soooooo tasty!!  Only $2 a piece?!? Worth the wait line. After having these tacos I felt it wasn't fair to pay more than $2 for a taco knowing these are on point!! Asada tacos taste GREAT and have salsa and guac on top and the adobada with pineapple is AMAZiNg!!! You cannot miss put on this gem :) eat there now!!!
muy mal servicio del taquero...un senor canoso viejo enojon..y muy mal humorado..con voz de enojo y de descontento te preguntava cuantos, en lo que pensabas k mas pedir te decia en tono grotesco..cuantos en total quieres no puedo estar picando de pokito...esta a un lado del otro taquero k prepara solo los de pastor..no vayan..muy mal servicio
This place is right off the strip and well worth the adventure, as it is cheap, delicious, and authentic.. The biggest drawback is the long lines, which are awful when you are starving andhave to smell everything going on inside.. The carne asada fries are a must and do not disappoint.. This is a great alternative to the pricey strip! O and they are open really late.
I'm loving it!. make sure to add pineapples to the spicy pork tacos!. oh oh oh and don't forget the fries with meat!
Seriously the best street tacos I've ever had in my life! The food is cheap and orgasmically delicious. Thankfully I don't live close enough to eat here everyday.
As authentic as your going to find in Vegas at 4am with the last $10 in your pocket. DRUNK FOOD!
Still very good the second time around. The TACO highlights:. . LA LENGUA (beef tongue). ADOBADO (pork). CARNE ASADA (beef steak). . Those are a MUST. All super full of flavor, with that good salty seasoning tast. Very rich and tender in meat. The line is usually really long for the Lengua so you know it's good. I spend a good $10.00 for 4 tacos and a drink. I call that a good steal because really I tapped out at my 3rd taco.. . I want to try their fries one day, but do beware as I heard that it is very filling even for a big eater. A GOOD PLACE FOR AFTER THE CLUB SOBRIETY FOOD and LUNCH TIME DROP IN AFTER A LONG WALK ON THE STRIP and IF YOU'RE BALLING ON A BUDGET.
A co worker told me about this spot before I came to Vegas. We love tacos so of course we had to try them! It's a small place in a shopping area next to the Riviera. We ordered the asada and adobada tacos. The asada tacos were ok, tortillas were freshly made right in front of you but, the meat didn't have too much flavor. The adobada tacos were so yummy! Full of flavor! I would definitely recommend the adobada tacos! Be prepared to wait bc the lines are long!
Go here if you're reading this. I've travelled throughout Mexico and these are super authentic street tacos. Better than anything I've had in Los Angeles.
If I want tacos and I mean better than King Taco in LA this is the place. Hands down best tacos I have had in a long time.  I went here with a couple friends and we destroyed at least 8 tacos each.  They are just good, fresh made tacos.  . . Want to get your grub on and not spend a bunch of cash?  Hit this place up and you will be satisfied.
Real pastor on the spit. Game over. This is what I've been looking for forever. Just like it used to b in Mexico. Keep it up guys. Love ur spot
Tried this place after reading the reviews and I wasn't disappointed.  No problem with the ordering system and the service was great.  I has the abodado and al astor tacos loaded.  Love that they give you a whole plate of grilled peppers and green onions.  Total bill $8.  I paid more for one beer at the Palazzo.  Nothing fancy but a real solid value.
Really really really good. As a first-timer I found the set up a little overwhelming/confusing, but then I put an asada taco in my mouth and everything was right in the world. So much flavor. The avocado sauce is serious. The grilled peppers on the side are necessary. Spicy pork was super tasty. . . I wish they had chips. I may not look like a gringa but I do eat like one...
tacos , quesadillas and OMG! to the al pastor mulitas, place was Bomb lol no lie not just any tacos lol and prices are good
