Very unfriendly and regimented staff...no flexibility!  Carpet in room is dirty (the bottoms of my feet are black!)  No coffee in room, sofa setting awkward, not enough towels, heavy doors that slam easily.
If I could give this resort negative stars I would. I stayed here in January of 2013 for my wedding. Was married in the shark reef and had a wonderful wedding. It was worth the price I paid. Our photos came out wonderful and the photographer and wedding planner where excellent. . Now I'm going to go into why I believe this resorts deserves the negative stars. The hotel layout was horrible. The hotel rooms had weird layouts and decor. The casino was small and the slot machines with wound so tight that you couldn't ever win. There were dirty glasses left in the bridal suit from the wedding the day before And my wedding was at 9am.  The photograph company reminded me of a used car sales lot. $3500 for a digital copy of all the photos taken. Really??? Do people pay that? It's Vegas it's suppose to be cheaper then a wedding at home. . The last and most important thing I have to say about the  resort is the way they run business when it come to accounting. I booked 4 rooms. One of which was included in my wedding package for 1 night. 2 of the rooms were for 1 night and the suit that was included in my package I added a second night. The 4th room was for 2 nights. I gave the receptionist my credit card for all 4 rooms and did my thing. I checked out of all the rooms and showed $ 0 due on my bills. Then I get a debt collection letter 1 year later stating I didn't pay for one of the rooms and they had tried to contact me. I never received anything from the hotel. No email no phone call no letter in the mail. Nothing! They never billed my card for the amount due when I checked out. They made a mistake and if I would have know this I would have paid don't get me wrong. I have to let everyone know that this resort had a poor business practice of collecting payments. I will never due business with them again and I strongly recommend that others do the same.
I enjoy visiting Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino.  Have been here many times over the years, but it remains a Vegasproperty that we have yet to stay at.  The rates have been a bit too high.. . What do I like about Mandalay Bay?  The convention center is cool!  The casino is terrific (yes, I've won here in the past).  The self parking garage is easy to navigate.  The ventilation in the casino is wonderful.  It is so much easier to breathe here compared to other properties on the Strip.  The entire atmosphere of the place is just first rate.. . One of these days we will actually spend the night here.  Until then, we are more than happy to just visit frequently.
Poor access from monorail. Poor restaurant qualities and diversity. Poor lobby (only twos gents working at front desk with loads of people in line). Poor bell desk (took 30 mins to get to my room to give me new access cards to give to me to change my room...since the room next to me was noisy with partygoers). Old dirty carpeting. Basic bathroom. Avoid this hotel. Stay at MGM
One of the better hotels restaurants are good, but a bit pricey for what you get. The beach was nice, but too small for how popular it is. $20 for sunblock crazy. They didn't have restaurants that you could just grab and go, like a subway.
I stayed here with a few friends back in October. We were in Vegas for a convention. Mandalay Bay exceeded my expectations- it was extremely clean, the amenities were fantastic, and the staffwas above-and-beyond helpful. I wish I had gotten some of their names. I can't wait to go back!
Great place with pretty nice rooms. The service was great just like the food. Loved the amenities and extras. A really great experience. I've stayed in 3 Vegas hotels and this is my favorite by far. Can't wait to go again.
I always end up coming back to the Mandalay Bay.  It is convenient to access from 1-15 south or from the airport because it's the first major resort on the Strip.. . This resort has a very relaxed feel to it and is virtually odorless.  I'm not sure what the MGM Grand did recently with its scent, but holy moly it's hard to breathe in there.. . The wave pool is huge and a ton of fun.  No one has anything else like it.  There is a pool casino, a concert area, food court and plenty of cabanas and beach chairs.. . The selection of restaurants is really top notch.  Stripsteak is my favorite steakhouse anywhere.  Kumi has some amazing sushi offerings.  Check out my reviews for those places.. . The best part are the rewards for being a VIP.  Here's how you do it:. . -Go there and get an Mlife players club card...good at any MGM Hotel.  Play table games, slots and present your card when you eat at the restaurants.  Anything you purchase, charge it to your room.  This will rack up points fast.. . -If you are going with friends* that don't frequent Las Vegas, then offer to book the rooms for them.  This way, everything they charge goes to your account and you rack up even more points.  *Make sure these are reliable friends! You don't want to be on the hook for their bill.. . -Sign up for email offers in Mlife and through Mandalay Bay.. . -After your trip, just wait for the email offers.  Most likely you will get some good ones.  Sometimes it might take a couple trips to get the good offers.. . I regularly get room comps for 1 night when I stay 2.  Usually the second night is about $99 on weekends, but that really depends on what's going on at the hotel.  I've paid as little as $19.. . Gold status and above on Mlife gets you priority check in, although it is largely a thoughtless execution.  There are only 2-3 employees at the priority checkin....but 20 for normal folks.  I've waited longer to check in at the priority desk than the regular desk on many occasions.. . I have Platinum status now...but it doesn't really do much for you.  The best thing is the taxi stand.  We were there for the Pacqiuao on 12APR14 and there was probably a hundred people in line for a cab.  I just flashed the Platinum and got the next cab, which was very cool.  But for room upgrades...they never have anything available.  And I mean NEVER.  I have checked in on a Monday night where no events are scheduled and still there was no room upgrade available. So expect to never see that happen.. . Overall, this is my favorite hotel on the strip.
Looks way nicer on the outside. The room I was in was very dark and there was very little ventilation in the bedroom and none what so ever in the bathroom. Also what was very frustrating was that after 12am it seemed like there was nowhere to get anything to eat. And the one place I did find that was 24hrs had run out of pretty much everything. Wouldn't stay there again. Maybe just to visit the pool for the day but that is it.
Most casinos on the strip have adequate air circulation. Not Mandalay Bay, which is pretty bad seeing their are a lot of families. The entire facility is one giant ashtray.
Let's just say ... I walked in but I don't remember walking out haha.. . It was one of those nights in Vegas. We attended a gathering here at one of their crowded nightclubs. Thank goodness we were in the VIP section because the dance floor was way too crowded.. . What happened later that night? Aaaaah ... listen baby ... what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. I do remember waking up at the MGM Skyloft, holding my head and thinking, "Everything in my wallet is replaceable." Thankfully I found my satchel by the door. That's all I'm saying about that (Forrest Gump voice).
If I could leave them no stars, I would had done so. DO NOT STAY AT THE MANDALAY BAy. We went to Vegas on Saturday 4-19-2014 weekened, and went straight to our room on the 10th floow room 305. To our surprise the 2 queen size beds were actually full sizes. Not a big issue but then when one of our friends laid on the bed, she noticed that there was potato chips and pinapple chunks behind the pillow. We tried calling front desk, but the phones were disconnected. We had to go back down to the lobby to resolve the issue.They reconnected our phones and send some cleaners to replace the sheets and pillows but told us that their queen size beds were of that size. later on, when we went to use the bathroom, the bathroom had 2 huge moths flying around. We manage to killed them but that left a huge guts splatter on the wall. Turning on the bathroom lights, shorted out the circuit and the lights either flicker or died out for minutes at times. Calling the front desk again, they acknowledge that the bathroom lights were crappy and ask us to use the breakers. They later send in a few "engineers" to look at the issues and a "manager" came and look at the bug splatters of the moths we killed. The engineers acknowledge that the lights were faulty and the months might had gotten in through the ducts while the manager just came, look around at the dead bugs and left. The TV also kept switching from power saving mode and normal mode which was annoying when watching the games. The walls are also pretty thin, we can hear the TV from one of the rooms next door and laughter from the opposite wall.. . Went to lights, we had 3 tables books across our various friends that went. the floor was so nasty that I thought I had step on gum the entire night only to find my shoes to be bum free. thats when we realized that the floors were the issue. Each step was like stepping on glue. The rails of the stairs leading to our tables upstairs werent very santizing either. For $1500 for a table, that's $4500 for 3 and so not worth it. Prices for drinks were also high as well. Close to 50 bucks for 3 shots of goose, thats pretty much more expensive then a bottle of goose itself. The only thing that save the night was Alesso being an awesome DJ.. . On sunday, we ordered breakfast and the pricing was ridiculous. 3 plates of steak and eggs with bacons cost $50.00. To add insult, we notice that they charged us $60 something and ask why there was additional charges in which they reply, the utentials and the table cloths is what those charges are. WHO charges $10+ for utensials!!! The egg was over cook, the bacon were rubbery.. . Not only were our room dirty, the electricty was working on and off, bugs everywhere and Mandalay Bay doesn't really give a crap about their customers. Our friends in another room who booked 2 queen with a couch bed was given a 2 queen with no couch bed. They had to argue with them to get a roller bed move to their room, by arguing that their website stated they would get it when they book the room.. . Overall this has been prob the worst hotel room I ever had in Vegas
We have stayed at The Hotel many times, so we know it's a good hotel, but our last visit was very frustrating. We were given a corner room right near the outdoor elevators that ran so loud I couldn't sleep. And, with the remodel of The Hotel into The Delano Las Vegas we were disturbed on Saturday with a knock at our door to present us with a "get out tomorrow (Easter Sunday) at 11:00 for the remodel" letter. Uh, no late checkout for me! But, the most frustrating experience was finding a belonging from a previous guest that I found in the safe. I called the owner who had already asked the front desk if someone would look for the item (and {{why}} wouldn't Mandalay check the safe?)  and I arranged with the owner to leave the item at the front desk. With the mass-exodus of the hotel at 11:00 with the remodel I didn't want to wait in the line to turn in the item and checkout, so I handed it to a conceirge. She rolled her eyes at me and said "Now I have to walk this over to the front desk". Excuse me? Isn't the Concierge full service? http://www.mandalaybay.com/features-and-shopping/concierge/. What would have happened if I asked for plane reservation, show tickets or a cabana?  I get the feeling Mandalay bad doesn't care about guests before a remodel, doesn't care about guest's lost belongings, and doesn't want to give customers extra service. I definitely didn't get that "vegas" high service. Next time we'll go back to Encore or the Bellagio.
One really nice Hotel close to free way access ( 15 north or south bye making right out of the hotel.). . Decided to come and check it out hit a progressive first time and then sat down at a couple of monopoly games almost hit a 1000 pay out ! but of course it ticked over and paid out 150 lol. . . Really nicely lit casino with lots to do there. From eating restaurants that range from high to low like house of blues etc. . . Seemed to have a massive betting room a little smaller poker room but huge 21 tables. . . Yet to stay over night but perk living local I guess also not triied the pool yet either to do though .. . Vallet are the nicest I have dealt with to date.
I hit Vegas 5-6 times a year, and try to stay somewhere different as often as possible.  Mandalay was next on my list, and I'm very glad I tried it.  Although at the extreme south end of the strip, which makes it a little inconvenient, they have more than enough to keep you busy and offer a tram that takes you to Luxor and Excalibur.  . . We stayed in what they call a Great Room Suite, and what I call a "starter suite."  Although it could use a little touching up (it showed some signs of wear), it was damn nice.  I need one of those double-chaise-lounge-rectangular-couch-things!!  The double sinks were nice, and my wife and I are still debating whether the tub was made for two or three.  Maybe we'll settle that next time.. . The only real problems with the Mandalay were (1)  the housekeeping service, and (2) the lack of cheap food options.  Housekeepers were extremely friendly and polite, but inattentive.  When you have to call down because they forget to leave you some toilet paper, there's a problem.  And when you've been drinking for 12 straight hours, there's no real desire to spend $30-75 on dinner.  Fast food will do, but you have to hump your ass all the way to Excalibur to find anything cheap.  And you better do it before 10:30, because that's when the tram quits running, and who needs that kind of exercise late at night?  . . On the up side, EVERYONE I interacted with there was professional and friendly.  I wish I could remember the name of the guy who checked us in, because he deserved a pat on the back.  And although it took me about 3 days of slot playing to finally get a drink from a cocktail waitress, I must say that she was very nice and prompt, and circled back regularly once I finally popped up on her radar screen. . . Will I stay at Mandalay again?  Hell yeah.  It's a step below places like Aria and Venetian, but it's much nicer than many of the places I've been.
The best option for families. Nice rooms. Overall great customer service. Could use a bit of deep cleaning especially bathrooms. You will need to bring a bit of cash to do it right. Due to location a lot of taxi rides. Overall a great stay. No other place if you bring children. You can get the room for a reasonable price, but everything else is pricey.
Turns out that I don't like Las Vegas. I didn't really have any expectations when I went, so I wasn't necessarily let down... but I wouldn't go back. Way too tacky for my liking, but I can see the appeal for most people; I just happen to be a boring idiot. . . That said, the Mandalay Bay was pretty nice. It is absolutely gargantuan and not at all a place to stay if you're looking for peace and quiet (and in that case, get the f out of Vegas), but the service was good and my room was pretty sweet. I had requested a king size bed, but I ended up with two queens. I was too apathetic to say anything, so I ended up having a bed for partying and a bed for sleeping. Fine with me! . . I love the late checkout option ($30 extra for a 3pm checkout), as I'm not a morning person and I stayed up super late the night before. They also hold your bags for you when you have checked out but want to go explore, and even though that's pretty standard, it's always an appreciated service.
I stayed at Mandalay a couple weeks ago and I have to say they were incredible compared to the south point hotel. The Mandalay has smallish rooms for the strip, but they have a great view and fish swimming all throughout the lobby! They also have the light nightclub which is epic!
This joint would have been higher on my star list if not for a couple of issues on my last stay here... overall though I do like this hotel and have been here multiple times.. . However on my last stay here I noticed the following things that made me disappointed and/or to shake my head in pure wonderment:. * There was mold in the shower on the ceiling and on the caulking. * There was lipstick on the pillow shams, confirms that they werent changed and washed! Which I always figure is the case... who knows what else is on those things.... * The no hat policy for the regular bars in the casino proper??? Seriously WTF... but flip flops and t shirts are ok? I mean can we at least have a sensical dress code here. You can go hang out while wearing flipflops and dance even while wearing basically anything but a hat. . . I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE NO HAT THING. I am a hat guy. I love wearing hats. If someone wants to wear a hat in a bar after 7pm when they are buying drinks why forse him to take off the hat? Is "hat hair" really so much "KLASSIER"? I dont think so in the slightest.. . Some other observations:. * There are options for both free and paid wi-fi. * Great amenities like the Shark Reef, Wave Pool, Lazy River, etc. * Most of the table games have higher than average limits for the strip. * Lots of great free parking =D. * Its a great venue for concerts where even the back seats have a decent view of the stage and you can hear everything quite well.. . The beds were comfortable and not overly soft as many hotels can be. The towels were fresh and that made me quite happy. Nothing worse than getting stained towels or ones with pubes hanging out in them.... . As my last trip was a work related trip, I found that I was comfortable working at the desk and was able to spend a few hours there completely a bunch of photo editing without issue before heading down to play in the casino next door. =). . Overall I do recommend this place, unless you like to wear hats. Then its like you're in the hat Nazi zone if you want to hang out in one of the various bars or lounges there.
