I love this place!  Its ever changing and upgrading, probably the only hotel downtown that does.  Just went last weekend and had our usual clean room in the Rush Tower.  They have once again renovated and are set to open up a new "Tequila Cantina" and Claim Jumper restaurant.  Unfortunately, we were a little too early to enjoy these new places.  Staff is always super nice and helpful.  Will continue to be a patron for many years to come.  Keep up the good work!!
Golden Nugget is the gem of Downtown LAS Vegas!. . I stay there for a few nights every couple months.  I'm pretty cheap and like to get more bang for my buck.  I stay in the Gold Tower, which is VERY nice, and is right off the casino floor.. . As I noted, I'm pretty cheap, instead of wasting my money on room service etc., I go to the ABC market that's just a few steps on Fremont.  I buy my food and drinks there.  The money I save goes to partying.. . The Gold Tower rooms are reasonably priced and luxurious (comparatively speaking).. . I should remove a star for the crappy "band" they now have at the Rush Lounge.  The entertainment was 100Xs better before.  . . The past seven years I've been staying there (on the regular) has been a wonderful experience.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.. . Update 12/12/14:  Golden Nugget brought back the great classic rock/rock & roll band to the Rush Lounge.   The name is *Rock This Town*.  Thank you Golden Nugget for bringing them back :-)
Stayed here again for our 20th anniversary as it was cheaper than the strip, we paid for two in addition for our friends. I booked the rooms 3 months ahead of time and when we checked in they did not have the king sized bed I requested. No apologies from the guy behind the counter, he just said "maybe tomorrow we will have one". So we slept on a full sized bed for three days, it was not even a queen! Most of the staff was not very friendly.
This is my absolute favorite hotel in Las Vegas.. . I love the location of downtown Las Vegas. . It has not one, but TWO Starbucks in the hotel.. You go out, and you are right in perfect area of Fremont St. . . The customer service is amazing there. . Rooms clean. . Love the casino. . . The pool area is the BEST!. The shark tank that has a slide in it. . . The 1st time you go down the slide it's so fast. You don't when get a chance to notice anything. . Next time you go on the slide you know when to slow yourself down a little bit so you can look at the fish around you. :). . I love this place.
Went to Las Vegas with a group, to visit a convention in town. So I made our reservations, to hold the room. And was told that it would cover the first night! all is good right, wrong. We checked in and told them we are splitting the room charge and the stay, they took both credits cards,and said it will be done !  We Checked out on Sat. 4/5/14 they split the bill, took our credit cards ,and split them. Never saying they are only splitting the second  night ! So ,just so you know, if you are using your  credit card to hold the first night , you will end up paying for that night ! And if you hold more ,rooms your stuck. Only way , I found out was 2 charges for one stay ! And the lady at the Nugget , said what do you want me to do about it! Then she tells me I'm not the first one that said something. Really !!!!
doesn't include free internet with stay.. room is big but a bit out dated. no coupon booklet or anything special when check in.. No! I won't be back again (to stay in hotel) I would rather stay at downtown grand.
If I would have wrote this review right after check in it would get 1 Star. But the staff and amenities changed that. . . Check In : We arrived at 9am and went to check in to see if we could possibly get into our rooms early (We had 5). They told us possibly by 11am. Normal check in is 3pm. So we checked our luggage and went to gamble. Came back around Noon and stil no go on the rooms. Okay, no big deal. Came back later and see a long line. So I get in line and see group after group leave with room keys. Get to the front and they tell me our rooms still aren't ready. I asked how is it possible that guests are walking in off the street and getting rooms and rooms we've been waiting for 5 hours still aren't clean. The frond desk clerk gave me attitude and eventually we got our rooms, ON 3 Different Floors. . . Casino : The casino is small in comparison to the ones on the strip, but it's great and every dealer, waitress, etc was great. We all had a blast.. . Pool : The pool is amazing, it's beautiful. We also loved playing BJ and Craps out in the beautiful weather. The prices on alcohol are a high but actually pretty reasonable as far as Vegas goes. And of course don't miss the slide through the shark tank. . . All in all it was a great time, we were here for my 40th bday and it was amazing. If not for the check in mishap I would have gave the Nugget 4 stars without hesitation. But if you are going to stay downtown, this is the place to be.
They have done some great updates to the casino. Looks much newer, the pool area is great with the new aquarium slide. The sushi restaurant is decent. Downtown Vegas is always fun.
The Grille is great for.a late night djnjng experience. Had the Philly steak and cheese with potato salad..Husband had buffaLo Wings with fries.  Well worth the price.. only recommendation is they keep it clean (e.g. tables wiped, floor swept, trash bins emptied)..
My personal favorite hotel in Las Vegas! I have stayed here so many times on a staycation that I can't even count. The Rush tower is beautiful, the rooms are fab! I love the pool, even though it looks like a bowl of people soup, it's packed and still fun! The bars are great, I love all the restaurants, gambling is great, the location is awesome to all the downtown fun going on. I could go on and on how much I love the nugget.
We stayed in the Carson Towers, which is the older section of the hotel. The air conditioner in our room was extremely loud, no central air. The room was ok just slightly outdated but clean. The pool and shark tank  were great but you have to get your spot early before all the chairs are gone (seems by 11:30 they're all taken/reserved). Friendly staff, decent breakfast buffet. Good cocktails poolside.
The hotel, casino and restaurants were nice enough to have earned 5 stars if only the customer service has not been lacking.. . First vacation for my wife and I in over two years, we had a couples massage booked for the morning of my birthday that Golden Nugget cancelled due to the couples massage room betting flooded (or the ceiling having caved in depending on who we talked to). We understand these thing happen, so no biggie. Asked the front desk what they could do to make things right, seeing as how this had all been planned and paid for over two months in advance and we got 3 days notice on the cancellation, we were given the extension number for the spa director (who was half-way across the country in Biloxi) and told to leave her a voice mail. When we complained on the Golden Nugget Facebook page we were given an email address for the same individual. Shameful customer service making the customer call/email somebody who isn't on-site to help at the time. . . Just a tip for any Golden Nugget representatives who read these reviews, a customer who feels they've been wronged generally won't complain unless they feel really strongly about it. If they do go to the trouble of complaining, please listen to and address their concerns rather than giving them a phone number or email address of somebody else so they can handle it. The only time you should give a complaining customer a name, phone number and email for somebody else is if they ask for it. Otherwise, take care of their concerns and they may be a customer for life rather than go to the trouble of writing bad reviews of your hotel on Facebook, Yelp, Yahoo, etc.. . ***UPDATE***. . I received an email reply from Ms. Taylor, the spa director. She handled my issue with the concern and empathy that I'd expect from a customer service professional and offered a resolution that my wife and I agree is more than fair and gave us reason to give Golden Nugget a second chance to make us a customer for life.
This was my 1st time ever staying downtown and boy has my opinion changed! The nugget is MUCH nicer than I ever remembered! The Charthouse restaurant inside had a lovely lunch menu with a floor to ceiling aquarium. The pool area has been completely redone with a slide, shark tanks and outdoor black jack tables. I stayed in the Rush tower with newer rooms that were beautifully done... Leather sectional and very chic modern decor. I'm going back in June and staying here again... Can't beat the price!!
Stayed at the Carson Tower with my wife and 6 year old daughter during her spring break ( Tuesday - Friday in mid April).. . Arrived Tuesday around 4pm and the check in counter at the Carson Tower was closed so we had to check in at the Rush Tower which is about a 2 minute walk.  Apparently, this is pretty common so don't be surprised.. The check in areas featured self check in Kiosks, but I did not use them.  Check in took about 3 minutes after a 10 minute wait.. . Our room in the Carson Tower was clean, fresh smelling and definitely no-frills.  There was no microwave, refrigerator or Wi-fi available in our Carson Tower room.  The room includes a wired Ethernet port that requires payment as well as a coffee maker that also requires payment if you use the provided coffee pods.  The room size is standard and everything worked fine (air conditioner, shower, sink, TV, etc.).. . The donut shaped pool is very nice with a shark tank in the middle and waterfalls spaced out around the pool that you can swim under or walk through.  However, the pool is small for the occupancy of the hotel so it will get crowded during holidays.. . There is a small Arcade room near the Carson Tower elevators that feature an Air Hockey table and some video games.  The Air Hockey cost $1 per game.. . Overall, a nice hotel that was reasonably priced ($60/night for weekdays in mid April).  Most hotels on the strip costed about 2.5 to 3 times that amount.  The Golden Nugget is a hybrid between a cheap downtown hotel and fancy strip hotel.  We will likely come back.
Wow, can't believe there is a such nice hotel & Casino in Down town Las Vegas, I love this place so so much, especially the pool is next to Shark Tank, very chill and relaxing. . Love the Asian Marketing Manager "Gina" , she is very friendly.  5 stars
