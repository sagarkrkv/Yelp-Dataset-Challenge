if bouchon is my go-to for brunch in the venetian, then grand lux cafe is pretty much my go-to for every other meal in vegas. it has an extremely large menu, with enough choices to please even the pickiest of persons. . . whenever we roll deep with 15+ people, this is easily the place to go if you don't want an hour+ wait.. . i have found myself here more times than i'd like to admit after a night of clubbing. somehow, we always end up here, even when we're not staying at the venetian/palazzo. and nothing tastes better than their basket of fries after a long night of drinking.. . everything i've had on the menu has been a hit with me -- burgers, sandwiches, pastas, meat entrees, anything fried... even their brunch (gasp, i know. not better than bouchon though). . . i've heard some friends say their sandwiches or salads were just average. i say choose wisely, my friends. don't order something on the menu that doesn't look like it's gonna be good just because it's "healthier" or whatnot. you're in vegas, you shouldn't be on a diet.
Huge portions but be prepared to wait for it. Just flew in and met my coworkers for a quick late lunch. There were maybe 5 other tables that had people but our food took forever to come to the table. So much for the quick lunch. I had a chicken salad sandwich that was kind of bland. The empanadas were good. Ratings more based on the service than the food.
This is basically a cheesecake factory without so much cheesecake and no brown bread!. It's open 24 hours, so we grabbed a light dinner before hitting the clubs and came back around 3 am for desserts. I'm in love with the chocolate creme brulee! The chocolate fudge cake and the bread pudding were good too. Unfortunately, they were out of the dessert we originally wanted to order (something involving bananas).. For dinner, I wasn't too hungry so I split a margherita pizza with a friend. It was pretty standard
Literally wrote the longest reviewever for this place and then realized I didn't want to be one of those people.. . Here's what you need to know. . 1)  Great spot any time of day - pretty awesome in the middle of the night. 2)  Their food is exceptional - if you're drunk/hungover/about to pass out... whatever.  Just don't expect it to taste like the dish you're served once you get to heaven then you'll be disappointed.. 3)  Yes, the line will look intimidated - but calm down... you'll be seated in 10-15 mins.. 4)  I literally ate here every meal during my stay at the Venetian a couple weeks back.  20% out of convenience and 70% because of the good food.. 5)  It's not expensive... especially for Vegas. . Good stuff:. . Whatever the hell those mashed potatoes wrapped in an egg roll are called. . The miso cod - had it for lunch and dinner with the mashed potatoes instead of rice.  It's really good. . Their volcano shrimp. . The corned beef hash - my bf actually exclaimed "this is real meat!" when he got it. . My least favorite was the Ahi tuna salad but it was still good (and I'll admit, it's a hard dish to pull off if you're not a sushi restaurant).. . GO EAT THERE
Since the food court in the Casino area at Venetian does not have many options, my coworker and I decided to dine at Grand Lux.  . . They have very extensive menu and the portion is huge.  Their food is nothing special but good overall.  Service is great! We had a very attentive and polite waitress.
I really like the food here. It's super tasty and they have a great selection. Also the service is great. Definitely coming back.
Terrible breakfast buffet. Cold eggs. No waffles. No muesli. Slow, disinterested service.
Came here on a Tuesday evening, after the average "dinner rush," though being Vegas, places are busy all the time. Some people have mentioned a large line and little wait time, we found both the line and wait time nonexistent. The lady who escorted us to our seat was pleasant, asking me how my day was doing. I found the personalized attention refreshing. Once seated, our server could not have been better. She gave us the perfect amount of time to go through the menu before we were ready to order, and continually checked up on us and refilled our drinks without us asking. Our food came out in a timely fashion, and all was cooked to perfection- fish and burgers alike. As for dessert, we ordered a cheesecake, a cupcake creation, and a slice of key lime pie. The key lime pie was flavored perfectly-not too much and not too bland. The cheesecake was rich but tasty, and the cupcake dish was devoured in minutes.. . All in all, an affordable and delicious choice for dinner. You can easily dress up or come casual- matters not. The lighting could be romantic if you wanted, or comfortable with friends. I plan to make this a traditional stop when I am here in Vegas and strolling the Venetian.
Wonderful lunch with my husband and toddler. Had the sandwich/soup/salad combo. Asparagus soup was superb, loved the slightly sweet vinaigrette on the salad. Portions generous. Service was friendly and attentive. Would recommend to anyone!
Been here more than once after a night out of drinking.. But now I can say I've been here sober and not so sober!. . Quick seating, although it gets busy! Friendly staff & good for kids when the sun is still up. . . Like everyone says-- it IS like a Cheesecake Factory minus the cheesecake, but in my opinion and if I'm willing to make the drive out here, I like it better! . . This time around the better half and I had :. Blue Cheese Salad - not a blue cheese fan but this was good, could have a little less dressing. Calamari - FAVORITE! I liked the added fried zucchini and onions! . Kobe Meatballs - big meatballs, juicy and tender meatballs! Not too much sauce, comes on a bed of creamy polenta.. . I unfortunately could not have any of the pasta dish but it did look good! . . Must try if you're in the strip area!
This restaurant is pretty much like Cheesecake Factory, but not as good.  I believe they are sister companies. . . I came here with a group of 6 other girls for brunch after a weekend of bachelorette festivities.  Here's what I shared with my sis who was the soon bride to be:. . CREAM OF ASPARAGUS SOUP. This soup was quite tasty and definitely creamy! More on the creamy side than the vegetable taste but it's so good! I wish I only ordered this!. . SHORT RIB GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH - $13.50. Slow roasted short rib, caramelized and picked onion, arugula and melted cheese, served on country bread. A plate youcan share!  This crunchy and unctuous sandwich made also came with horseradish garlic sauce which really complimented it.  It also came with salad which I decided to have the cream of asparagus instead!  It's quite cheesy and greasy and all around good.  Although not the best grilled cheese I ever had, it was the greasy spoon I needed after a long weekend of drinking ;) . . PASTA CARBONARA (lunch pasta & salad special) - $12.50. Smoked bacon, peas, a touch of garlic and karma dan cream sauce! We chose the twisted pasta instead of spegetti.  The pasta portion is HUGE! Definitely share-able.  although I had to ask for extra sauce because it didn't seam enough.  Overall this dish was okay :). . As for the salad, I'm glad it didn't taste like regular typical house salad.  It had dressing and a lot of the veggies that were decent.. . My overall experience here was ok.  I feel we came here for convenience; it was in our hotel and we knew it had a variety of choices to eat.  Service was unfortunately weird although she was nice, there were a few mistakes and miscommunication  I guess.  Grand Lux is a place more for convenience than being part of the Vegas experience.
From breakfast, to dinner, to late night drunchies, this is the place to go. The menu is fairly priced and the food is great! During our stays at the Venetian, we ventured out to try different restaurants in this hotel but this place has them all beat. You can't go wrong with the burgers/sandwiches and fries. Their burger buns are really good. I recommend the spicy carnitas sandwich - slow cooked pork with avocado, cilantro, and salsa made to perfection! Also, the jambalaya is delicious and the lunch portion is more than enough food. . . The customer service is great. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Also, the waiting time for this restaurant is never more than 10 mins. It's a large place and it's run very efficiently. . . This place is probably the best restaurant on this side of the strip. Definitely recommend you try it out for yourself
Items Selected:. Red Velvet Pancakes - Fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes with a Hint of Cocoa, Chocolate Chips and Cream Cheese Frosting. Caramel Banana-Nut French Toast - Our Brioche French Toast Topped with Sauteed Bananas, Pecans and House-Made Caramel Sauce. Fried Chicken and Waffles - Topped with Crispy Fried Chicken Strips and Pecan Honey-Butter Sauce. Warm Sticky Bun Bread Pudding  - Served with Whiskey Sauce, Sugared Pecans and Whipped Cream. "The Best" Carrot Cake - Citrus Cream Cheese Icing. . An 'upscale' concept from the team behind The Cheesecake Factory I'd probably walked past Grand Lux Cafe one hundred times before realizing the ever bustling restaurant was open 24/7, a strong selling point given my early waking hours that led to further investigation of a menu that seemed perfect for a touristy weekend with visiting family.  Somewhat brasserie in design with gold garnish and heavy fabrics plus a "patio" on the casino floor it was moments to seven on a Saturday morning that our trio was seated overlooking the Venetian's lingering late-night revelers alongside the morning check-outs and with immense menus soon perused selections were made - a sweet and gluttonous affair slow to arrive and marred by slow refills as staff seemed to be idling into shift change.  Admittedly more than a little puckish when plates were delivered nearly forty-five minutes later it was with relieved but bemused smiles that the three of us first laid eyes on the constituents of our $80 affair and although what was ordered would have been better suited for a half-dozen, the majority of it was worth the wait - an aggressively spiced carrot cake loaded with nuts plus shredded coconut and some of the thickest custard-drenched French Toast I've found both amongst the city's best.
The mimosas here are generous and the breakfast selection is great. Being on the casino floor means tables closer to the entrance get a waft of nicotine from time to time.
I visited the Grand Lux Cafe Venetian for the first time this past weekend with my girls during a Vegas trip. We stopped in after dancing our butts off at XS. We ordered chicken tenders (only on the kid's menu so if you want them, just ask!), the jambalaya (I forgot the specifics, oops), and the garlic shrimp pasta. Everything was delicious and the service was great. If you're looking for a real meal after clubbing or just in the middle of the day, I suggest checking out Grand Lux Cafe. Their menu is extensive and everything is delicious!
Went for breakfast since The Mirage doesn't have a cafe (It looks like they are putting one in though). I ordered a cappuccino but it came in a coffee cup which I think is totally weird, but it was good. They offer a breakfast buffet so I cruised through it but was not impressed so we all ordered a la cart. I was HUNGRY so I ordered bacon and eggs AND blueberry pancakes. It was good, bacon was crispy, eggs were cooked just right, hash-brownswere nice and crispy. I like the big plump blueberries in the panckage. My husband had the chicken and waffles. That waffle was the BEST waffle EVER! I ended up eating his. My friends got the salmon platter and breakfast sandwich. The salmon/lox were really really good. The sandwich was big and my friend was only able to eat half. Overall it was a good breakfast but I would definitely get a waffle next time. Service was ok, they were busy. Plates are big enough to share.
