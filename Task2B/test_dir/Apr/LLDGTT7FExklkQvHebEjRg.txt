I haven't started with the meal yet but they have surely for my vote with bread alone! Got the Joes classic lunch with stone crabs, great price and combination if you wanna just try the stone crabs...boyfriend got the fried chicken, they mentioned that chix takes 20 mins and its worth the wait... oysters Rockefeller is good!
Steak was delicious!  Crab cakes were all crab no fillers.  The server was wonderful!  Well worth every penny!
Even though we are Vegas locals for nearly 3 years, this was our first trip to Joe's and it did not disappoint. For starters, the stone crab appetizer is amazing. The claws are bigger than i thought they would be and very delicious. They come with a good mustard type dipping sauce. The Oysters Rockafella is the best that i ever had and I have had alot over the years. . . For the main course we had the King Crab Legs which they cut with a scissors for you a the table making them very easy to eat. They are so big and so much of them that i couldnt even finish and needed to get some to go. Every piece of crab is at least the size of a hotdog. You don't have to work to hard to enjoy them. The other main course was crab stuffed shrimp. Needless to say that was great also. . . For cocktails we had the Reisling and the Bloody Mary. Best Bloody Mary I have had that I can remember. It comes with a large shrimp in the glass and the rim is a great mixture giving it that extra flavor. . . The service was great. Very professional yet friendly to joke around with.  Make sure you ask for Troy if you want good service. He took great care of us and we will make sure to see him again next time.
I love Joe's!  It's a favorite spot of friends and family that come to town.  I like that compared to STK, for example, it's more quite and refined.  It has an Old Boy's club feel to it.  The times I have been here was with groups of 5-12 but I think it's also perfect for date night if seated in one of their booths.  I've tried the chicken, steak, lobster bisque, key lime pie to name a few items and none of them have disappointed. Pretty generous portions especially for the desserts.  Staff is also excellent which at this price point is to be expected.
On top of all the other great reviews your reading, go for lunch and try the Liver & Onions.....yea  Liver & Onions. Be prepared to be blown away.. Been here 18 years and Joe's has always been  in my top three.
Took my girlfriend here for her birthday andfor the most part it was a good experience and good food. The service was good too. Waiter was very courteous and explained everything about themselves and the menu. We ordered the two cups of crab bisque which was good, oysters Rockefeller which I thought was ok, stone crab legs were good, crab cakes and lobster sole which was our main dishes were ok. Overall it was a good experience and service was good.
We had a great experience here. The food is awesome and the service is great. We ordered the Whale, a appetizer sampler and it was delicious. Someone recommended the stone crab claws, so that's what I ordered for my meal. They did not disappoint. Everyone loved their meal and the server was very attentive. It was on he pricey side, but well worth the money.
Joe's is a great place to get amazing surf n' turf. Located in Forum Shops inside Caesar's Palace. The ambiance is great - relaxed. The service is always good. My family and I have been coming here since we moved to Vegas - food and service have been pretty consistent. I try to keep my visits to a minimum due to my allergies.. . Stone Crab Claws:. Meaty and sweet crab claws. The shells are already cracked for you so it's easy to just remove the shells and eat crab meat. 4/5. . Petite Filet Mignon and Jumbo Alaskan King Crab:. Filet mignon is my favorite cut since I'm not a fan of animal fat. I ordered mine medium-rare and that's what I got on my plate.  4/5. . Try the crab bisque too, you won't regret it!
Kind of disappointing for the price.  I ordered a filet Oscar rare, as it should be, and confirmed that they understand what "rare" means.  My steak came out medium-well!  Kind of dry and had lost a lot of the flavor and tenderness you expect from a properly cooked filet.  I didn't send it back since it had already taken a while and we had a show reservation after dinner.  I didn't want to risk the time.. . The price is commensurate with any top-end steak house, but the result wasn't.. . We also had some of their famous crabs and they were very good.  The claws were pre-cut enough to make it pretty easy to get the meat out.  Their mustard sauce for the crab was very good, though honestly I prefer them with just butter.. . Service was very friendly, and she was really helpful on picking out menu items and her knowledge of the ingredients was perfect.. . I don't think I'd try it again since for the price, I don't want to risk another blah over-cooked steak.
They have stone crab in the name of the restaurant.  They sell stone crab and charge you a lot of $ since they market the stone crabs as 'fresh'.  Anybody who knows what a good, fresh crab is suppose to be will know that they are sweet.  These expensive crabs are not fresh or not sweet.
From the obvious stone crab claws to the always popular fried chicken, Joe's never disappoints, regardless of whether you're dining at the original in Miami or newer locations in Vegas. Make sure to get the cole slaw and salmon au poivre, and then finish with the peanut butter pie or key lime pie (which we didn't get this time because my wife's is better) but skip the chocolate fudge pie which was disappointing.
I am a lover of crab legs, and after watching an episode of Bizarre foods, I've always wondered what the fuss about crab claws was. So when I found a stone crab restaurant I was excited to finally get to try it. I had passed this restaurant while in the Caesars Palace. It's not in the actual hotel, but in the adjacent terrace building, so it might be a little hard to find. I made a reservation because in passing I noticed it was a little crowded. Our waiter was friendly, and knew the menu backwards and forwards. I ordered the Select 6 Florida Stone Crab claws, a side of sauteed garlic spinach, and roasted asparagus. There were a lot of extra dishes on the table, and after ordering the waiter decided he was going to reach over me and remove them.... Bad idea!!! The poor guy knocked over my water all over the table... And not so importantly, all over me :( luckily it was just water, and I'm in Vegas having am awesome time, so no biggie!!! Our food came out, and it was pretty amazing. My boyfriend had half a slice of their signature  key lime pie and half a slice cheesecake and his face led me to believe it was nothing short of amazing. My only complaint about this restaurant is that it was filled with tables of rich douchebags who were being extremely rude to the waiters and busboys... Oh and leaving with soaking wet pants :(
Unbelievably delicious! Prices are kinda steep and high but u get what u pay for. . I went here last time with my fiancee and fam, and we enjoyed everything! I mean from the mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, onion strings, oysters (i dont even like oysters), to of course the stone crab. Even down to the bread. . There's only 3 locations i believe in Chicago, Miami, and Vegas. We were all saying how they should open one up in LA. They have to... it would make a killing. But for the time being, since vegas is the closest, looks like we'll have to make a trip back soon.
I checked out this place with a buddy of mine for lunch while the rest of the party crew (unce unce unce) was battling hangovers back in the hotel room. The food can be pricey, but hey it's seafood and we're in Vegas and "turn down 4 what" right? We ordered a couple orders of stone crab claws along with hash browns and cole slaw. The crab was a hitter along with the mustard (mustard on the best ho!) sauce that was served with it. And that key lime pie to top it all off was money. Ca ching!
You must try Joe's Seafood if you are visiting LAS VEGAS.  Located inside Cesar palace "Forum Shop" consider as an upscale "Chain" restaurant in the States. . . While visiting City of Sin we had a lovely lunch on the "outdoor" patio of Joe's, watching all the shopper's go by, certainly jealous of the beautiful seafood dishes being piled on our tables :-) Joe's gets pretty busy and therefore I highly recommend reservation. . . The service was impeccable along with terrific food and great selection. It was an all around great experience. . . Upon arrival server brought us Bread basket, The bread basket comes with at least five different kinds of bread. The pretzel rolls and onion rolls were outstanding. . As far as food goes, Server suggested we should try the SEAFOOD Chopped Salad (she promised we won't be disappointment) and Oh my goodness was she right. It was the best Seafood Salad I have ever tasted and the price was just right vs most of the other selections on the menu (ONLY $18.95) . . We also tried the Colossal Lump crab cake which was beyond tasty and a bowl of Crab Bisque so creamy and good. . . I highly recommend Joe's!!! You won't be disappointed!
I had a wedding reception in the GiGi Room last Saturday. I couldn't have asked for a better day and the Joe's staff was a huge part of the reason. Given that the reception is the most expensive portion of the wedding, I was concerned that everything was going to go well because we were planning from California. . . Nicole was the coordinator for the room and she did a great job. She was very helpful and responded to e-mails quickly. She was available for us to test AV equipment and helped us store our . . Joe, server manager, for the night did a great job communicating and provided wonderful service for us. . . I may be biased because it was my own wedding but this was the best wedding reception food I have ever had. My filet mignon was cooked perfectly and the sides were amazing. Too bad I wasn't hungry with all the adrenaline of getting married.
