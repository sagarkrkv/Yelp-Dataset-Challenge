Unbelievable. Delmonico's was an unforgettable experience from start to finish.  We went there with a group of six to celebrate a 30th birthday. We called two days in advance to make a reservation (you can do it on their website too).  . . We arrived and were seated immediately and it was then that I realized that it would be a dining experience. We had 4-5 servers around out table at any given time. We were immediately served water, delicious little bread knots, and out drink orders were taken. I thought it was interesting that they did not give a drink menu, rather the server recited all drinks in the given category to each person (wines: red or white, beers: IPA or Stout etc). Then they reviewed the menu with us and took our orders. There were many specials available, and they brought us a sample of a cheese tomato pesto flat bread, on the house. . . The meal took a good 20 minutes, but it was worth every second (and dollar!). I had a filet, which was prepared to perfection. Sides are a la carte, and family style. The green beans, potatos au gratin, and country smashed potatoes were to die for. Very very delicious.. . This is hard to imagine, but the servers were almost too hovering. They filled your water after one or two sips. They definitely took care of us to any need. The prices are high, but worth it. Delmonico's is something I will always remember about Vegas.
I bring customers for dinner here every year during the ISC trade show for the past 7 years- and it always is the right decision. The drinks are some of the best on the strip, the Lobster Bisque and locally grown tomato salad ( yep a greenhouse in Vegas and the cheese made in house)  is to die for, and everyone that had steak said it was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. I had the Salmon special and it was great as their fish dishes always are.  Until last week I was never a fan of Key Lime pie- but when we got several desserts for the table the Key Lime pie was one of them.. and although I went in with hesitation... it was hands down the best dessert on the table...so the new rule for me is Key Lime Pie- but only at Delmonico!  As all things with the Emeril name impeccable service was our experience - even with a trade show crowd and a large private whiskeytasting event. Our water glasses were never less than 2/3 full, a server was always there for another drink or any issue. The pace of our meal was first rate. I'll be back again next year!
* Good Food * Good Service * Patrons Love People Watching* Pricey Food *. . 1) Crab Salad - Good stuff. 2) Ahi Ahi Entree - tasted like steak mMmm.  If everything tasted like this and was not meat, I can definitely turn vegetarian. . And then I ate off some of the girls' plates at the table, which include potatoes and asparagus - both were delish!
I really can't eat steak anywhere else in Vegas if I have the opportunity of getting a reservation here.. . Bone-in rib eye, creamed spinach.  Delicious.  No complaints!!!
Phenomenal! Food, staff and ambiance is impeccable! We had the filet, ham chop, cream corn and the potato gratin. I recommend them all! The banana cream pie was too die for and the special dessert was a brownie trifle with ice cream and marshmallow fluff, I ate until I was almost sick it was so great! Come here with an appetite and you won't be disappointed!
We had dinner reservations to celebrate a special event. We started off with a few drinks.. . Fried Soft-Shell Crab:. An appetizer with poached egg, frisee salad and lemon truffle vinaigrette. Lightly breaded and fried. Not greasy, not fatty and the shell was definitely soft. The citrusy salad compliments the dish. One of the best soft-shell crab versions I've had. We got 2 orders of these - they were that good. 5/5. . Filet Mignon:. Since I'm not a fan of animal fat, this is what I normally get. Some people may find it boring but I like my steak simple and lean. Very tender and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. This piece of meat didn't photograph very well since it looks so dark from all the pepper but it tasted good. 4/5. . Chateaubriand:. The second most tender and lean cut of meat. We got mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. 4/5. . Bone-In Ribeye:. Dry-aged prime with butter on top. Superb! 4/5. . Foie Gras:. This was a side item. Perfectly seared and mildly sweet. You don't really need to do much to make foie gras taste good. KISS (keep it simple, stupid!) 4.5/5. . Mushrooms with Garlic:. This side was really good. I love mushrooms and garlic. The mushrooms did not have just a hint of garlic. They were deliciously garlicky. 5/5. . Grits:. This has bacon and good melted cheese which makes this more interesting than it should be. I wouldn't normally eat grits but this was good. 4/5. . Creme Brulee:. I've been feeling tired of this dessert. I didn't find joy in eating this. Plain, ordinary and too safe. 2/5. . Delmonico Coquetel:. Gin, sparkling dessert wine, five spice-infused simple syrup, ruby red grapefruit and lime juices. Their signature cocktail...but why? Our server was right, I should've not wasted my time on this. It was too sweet and it just didn't taste right. I took a few sips and our server knew it was time for a different drink. 2/5. . A Tale of Two Cities:. Cherry vodka, elderflower liqueur, black cherry juice and citrus juices. This was deliciously amazing if you like cherry. 5/5. . Another drink we had was a martini with bleu cheese-stuffed olives. Since I'm not a fan of martini, olives or bleu cheese - it would not be fair for me to rate this. We got a free chocolate gelato and it was good. Service was good. Our server gave us recommendations and what to stay away from. Honesty is always appreciated.
I say 3.8 stars. . . It's absolutely what I would expect going in. I didn't think it was anything really special about it. My steak was cooked perfectly and the sides we ordered (musrooms, mashed potatoes, and shoot I can'r remember is they were green beans or asparagus) were all tasty. . . If you want a good old fancy steak dinner that's reasonably priced this place is not a bad place to go for it. . . Oh! the service was fantastic.
Wonderful experience! Classic service, friendly wait staff, perfectly mixed cocktails, and flavorful food. Our salads were absolutely perfect, the dressings on both were incredible. Our steaks were juicy and cooked to perfection - both of us got the rib-eye and all its flavorful goodness was all over the plate. I was however, surprised at the lack of ambiance in this place. It's got really nothing going for it but tables and good service and good food. I guess you don't need much more than that, but it's Vegas for goodness' sakes. Liven up the decor a bit! But go, please. You won't regret it.
Unbelievable Service there, and the food was very good, but service was top notch!
