Had a great meal at Bobby Q while in Phoenix for the week. It's tough to impress me with Q because of my long history of slow smoking meats in my ancient stick burner. . I started the meal with the Q rolls appetizer, let me say these are brilliant and amazingly good!! They are basically brisket egg rolls that melt in your mouth, so light and crispy with a ton of flavor!! I ordered the three meat combo with Pulled pork, Brisket and Baby Back ribs, my sides were the beans and the Mac-N-Cheese. Brisket was super moist and tender as was the pulled pork, Baby Backs fell right off the bone but didn't taste over done at all. Beans were good, not over powering as some Q places can make them, they are simple and good. Mac n cheese was creamy and super cheesy, didn't finish them because I was stuffed to the gills by then!!  The little donuts at the end of the meal are so good, I wanted to take a bucket of them with me! Service was great as well, Jason was my server and he did an epic job as I never went without iced tea, food was out quick and he was the one that talked me into the Q rolls. If I lived here I would be a regular for sure!
We visited Bobby Q for the first time this week. The food and service was great. We ordered the ribs, chicken and brisket. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The brisket was tender and cooked perfectly. Our waiter was very attentive. We will definitely go back!
We have saw the good reviews, so we decided to drop in and see it for ourselves. We went to the to go side and ordered to take home. I wish we wouldn't of waited so long. I ordered the pulled pork with shoestring fries and corn on the cob. My wife ordered the half rack ribs and same sides. My pulled pork was delicious and the spicy BBQ sauce is now my favorite sauce I have tried here in Phoenix. The ribs were awesome fall off the bone good. the corn tasted smoked as well best I have ever had, and the cornbread was great. By far the second best meat I have tried and best spicy BBQ sauce here back home love the volcano BBQ sauce at whole hog cafe. Portions were just the right amount to fill you up. Can't wait to try the sausage next time.
Not too many great BBQ places. This one is wonderful. Cornbread alonebrings us back.
Hungry for BBQ?  Run, don't walk, to this place!  In from out of town and gave it a shot based on YELP.  Place was a huge hit with the entire family.. . Great food...some of the best BBQ we've ever had.  Brisket rolls (Q rolls) as appetizer were fantastic.  We got the family deal for $28 on a Sunday and we had plenty of leftovers.  Cinnamon Sugar donuts (free) for desserts were a hit.  . . Service was fast and friendly.  We were seated quickly and all of our food and drinks ordered came to the table fast.  Decor is perfect - rustic but a little  upscale.. . Highly recommend doing reservations off their website before going - there was a big wait by the time we walked out on a Sunday.. . If we could give 6 stars we would - best restaurant experience we've had in years!!!
Hands down, it is the best barbecue restaurant I have ever been at. We were a party of six, and we ordered many different kinds of food and shared it all. The catfish was our least favorite dish. However, everything else was beyond amazing. We all agreed that the corn, mac and cheese, and cornbread were the best things ever ... Personally, I think their mac and cheese is the best mac and cheese dishes on earth :)
Great BBQ food...have to try the Brisket it's soo tender, melts in your mouth. Great decor, chill ambience. Our bartender Chelsea was very nice and attentive.
My wife and I have been going here for years. The food is fantastic. In house smoked meats are some of the best BBQ in town. The steak and crab leg special on Saturdays is my favorite. At $18.00 you can't go wrong. Great beer selection clean glasses and always cold. They strive for great service and we have always had a pleasant experience.  Highly recommend.
Let's start with the waitress. Could she be more enthusiastic? Probably not. She was great. Described the food like she was ordering for herself. Then the cornbread. Wow. Best ever. Period. Everybody ordered something different so i won't include all the details, just the highlights. Mac n' cheese. EASILY the best I have ever eaten. Let's talk ribs. My daughter will not touch BBQ sauce. She helped me gobble my ribs down with great enthusiasm. Fall off the bone might be an understatement. Service was great and surprisingly, the price was more than fair. If you are a BBQ fan, this is a MUST TRY.
I have been there three times now because it is absolutely delicious! . The first time, I got the rotisserie chicken with grilled vegetables- both were outstanding!  . I have also had the salmon, which was great and cooked perfectly. . I also went there with my family for a birthday celebration, so we all ordered various things.  The whole hog is great because it is a lot of food, and easily feeds 2 people.  The ribs are very tender, and the brisket is awesome!. Everything here is delicious, and this has definitely become one of my favorite places. . The cornbread is a great little appetizer, though I wouldn't eat too much because I prefer to save room for all of the BBQ!  . Overall, the service is fantastic, and the food is awesome. . Also, the donuts at the end, are a great touch! :-) . I would recommend this place to anyone!
This amazing place has been here what 30 35 years, maybe even longer. They are still great, if not better than ever.. I have always liked the food here. I just never seem to make it out to this part of town anymore.  If you are at Metro center or on the I17 headed south this is a great place to stop for Lunch or Dinner.. The meat here is wonderful! I mean really good. I love the Ribs, and the BBQ sauce is mighty fine. . It is always busy here, is it any wonder. they are still serving up great food and great service. I know that they have a lot of other things on the menu, but I always  get BBQ.. When you like it, don't change. Full service bar and lots of parking.. Please do not drink and drive though.. Years ago the staff used to dress up in Costume, too bad they do not do that anymore.
The best BBQ ever and I am from Kansas City and know my BBQ!. . The baby back ribs were tender and meaty by far the best I have ever had.. . But don't stop there the four side dishes were also the best ever.. . The mini donuts were fantastic,. . The staff is unusually friendly and professional.
My wife and I stopped at Bobby Q's because we were in that area of town and looking for something tasty for lunch on Yelp. We found this place, which had several stellar reviews, and decided to give it a try. . . I got the beef brisket sandwich and my wife got the pulled pork sandwich. I had a side of fries and she got a side of macaroni and cheese. Starting with mine, the beef brisket was amazing. It was well seasoned, they used incredibly soft, super fresh, potato rolls for the buns, and the order came out hot. The french fries were crisp and well seasoned. . . The pulled pork that my wife had was good as well, however it was a little on the dry side, and probably could have used some more barbeque sauce. The macaroni and cheese was really good, and some of the creamiest I've ever had. As a starter, they also bring out cornbread which is hot, fresh and soft. It was quite excellent. . . For drinks we both got some of their specials. The drinks were massive, well priced at only $10 apiece, and easily big enough to share! Our waiter was Mateo, and he was really friendly and helpful. If he's working, request him. The restaurant itself had a huge outdoor covered seating area with fans and a fountain. There was a nice breeze, and even though it was a hot day it was still comfortable to sit outside. We really enjoyed this place, and would definitely go back.
I been coming here for around 6years.  The food is soooooo good I highly recommend any of their steaks and ribs. The side dishes are bomb and their corn bread and donuts are to keep coming back from them. The place is really nice but I usually do take out. Matias at the take out cashier is great he always make sure the order is right and the everything is in there he also organizes the bag so nothing trips over on the way back home.
First time eating here. I love it. There is no way anyone can eat all of this food in one setting. I'm completely speechless. Everything I ate was delicious even the donuts that they give you at the end of the meal. . . Ashlen is an excellent waitress! Extremely friendly and knows the menu well. I will definitely return, but the next time I'll make sure I have on my fat girl pants.
The service at this place is awesome! I've been here a few times for lunch and dinner and every time I come here I've always enjoyed the service. . . This place have the best BBQ by far in the Phoenix area!! The cornbread is excellent and I don't even have to mention the award winning Mac and cheese!!  . . If you looking for a place to bring your family, friends, or significant other this is a nice place for a date or family gathering!
This place has some great BBQ, there's no other way to put it. The serving size they give you per plate are huge, you'll more then likly be taking some of your meal home with you to enjoy later. The brisket is what i would suggest, its amazing.
I  visit Phoenix frequently from Houston and I must say this place is one of the best. From burgers to ribs you cannot go wrong with any entree at Bobby Q's. Tonight I tried the smokehouse burger and was extremely impressed with the flavor and quality. Portion size is it generous and the staff is top notch. I always look forward to my next visit to Phoenix!
