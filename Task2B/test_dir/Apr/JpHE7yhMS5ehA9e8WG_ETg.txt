Aria Home/Elements has the absolute worst customer service of all time. I have ordered bed pillows for two different homes twice and each time the service was terrible. I am shocked at the poor level of phone/email service from such a beautiful and reputable hotel.
We have stayed at this hotel once but we will for sure wbe coming back cause so far its had the most comfrotable bed on the strip and the nicest pool too.  When you walk in you do get hit with vanilla smell but u get used to it and its not as bad in the room as it is in the casino.  The rooms are spacious as well as the bathrooms but hte bed is the best feat in the room.  Once you lay down you dont want to get back up.  The pricing isnt bad just have to make sure there isnt any conferences going on cause this is the place to stay during conference season apparently.  . . But defintely a favorite of ours especially if we just want to erlax by the pool and get good rest and be able to control eveything with the little tablet by our bed then this is the place to be for sure and can't wait to come back and stay again hopefully this time we can get a few of the strip but the view we had last time wasnt bad of the rio it looked nice at night.
amazing service & incredible rooms, amenities, facilities. worth every penny, highly recommend! some (not all) of the on-site restaurants are pretty good too...
Wife and I just returned from 3 nights at the Aria/City Center all compliments of My Vegas and MLife.  We checked in around 10:30am on Tuesday March 18th and was pleased to find that our room was already available.  Very quick and easy check-in and very courteous.  What an amazing room the view was great and everything in the room was powered by something similar to an Ipad.  The bed was great and we slept very comfortably.  We didn't experience the curtains opening or music coming on as some reviews mentioned, but that was probably the only thing missing.  Nice having someone check for room keys before entering the elevators area and preventing non-guests from roaming the halls, etc.  Nice open gaming area, plenty of restaurants, bars and shopping too.  There is enough to do here without leaving the resort.
I would have preferred 0 stars for this hotel. . Our entire stay here was horrible. Upon arrival, they did not take our luggage to the room. The concierge was very rude with attitude. No one was available after 9pm to assist us with hotel room problems. Our hotel room was dirty. The spa double charged us for a massage so be on the look out for this. They gave us a key that wouldn't open our room and we had to call security. The whole hotel smelled horrible.. Overall, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! Cosmo seemed much better.
We had a suite booked here for company meetings. Weeks before the event, I had called to get information on an early check-in and was told it shouldn't be a problem at all. All I would have to do is call on the morning we were arriving to pre-register and we should be able to get in early. When I called to do that, all three customer service agents I spoke with were incredibly rude and unhelpful. Not to mention, they gave me completely different information than what I was told when I called weeks in advance. I will never stay here and we'll use another hotel for our company meetings now on.
I just stayed two nights at Aria. It is a great hotel...my company paid for it, which is great because I would never spend that kind of money...and the rooms aren't even the worse of it!! ONE drink at the pool will set you back a hefty sum...which I can't repeat here...just know, it's probably the most expensive on the strip.. We didn't get the chocolates or a turn down service that some other reviewers have mentioned, that's ok..most everything was wonderful.  I was dismayed a bit  at the bath products...a lower end brand, and of definitely lower end quality. . The restaurants were all really good that we ate at...the Thai place was as good, if not better, than any I've been to in the US.  The casino was nice, not too smokey, and the servers were pretty quick. . The pool was nice, a few good choices...one that was more adult orientated, so not a bunch of kids having a great time...not something I look for in a relaxing pool day. As usual...I always wish there was more shade and/or umbrellas..but all in all..a great pool experience. . All in all, a great place, although pricey..that's expected.
Love this hotel and it's post-modern luxury. From the smell to the dark ambiance, Aria ushers in a new era of Vegas resorts. Gone are the days if themed hotels with gimmicky attraction. We now have this beautiful hotel with is really interesting design.. . Only flaw is that it's owned by MGM. You can tell they use similar stuff in the rooms and they try to save money where possible. Cosmo is independent and you can really tell that it's not part of the MGM mafia.
This review is solely based on a couple of visits to the hotel, and only of the Casino.. . The casino floor is small, but has a beautiful shopping stores , and walkways outside. It looks very upscale and gorgeous from the outside, but the inside is just the same generic set-upof every other casino. There is nothing that sets aside Aria's casino from others, and is much smaller than the others on the strip.. . I do, however, like that they employ an older range of women as their cocktail servers on the casino floor. As a designer, though, their costumes were so outdated for such a classy, and modern hotel. . . I probably wouldn't return to this hotel, truth be told. There isn't anything interesting that really draws me in unless I have comps here.
Stayed: 4/2-4/4. . Positives: Bell Services. We had to store our bags before check in and after check out before our flight. They were incredibly courteous and professional.. . Price: They offer military discount which is a nice gesture.. . Location: right in the city center. . . Nice shower. Rain shower head. . . Cons: . . Very small casino.. . Nothing special. As first time visitors, we wanted to be wowed by our casino. If you want opulence and "Vegas" this isn't it. Go to Bellagio, Caesars, NYNY, etc. . . We had a lousy room location (4th floor)-not a nice view. If you book here, request a room above the 7th floor. . . Our room wasn't the cleanest. They sent someone up right away to assist, but it wasn't a good first impression. . . All in all, not horrible, but not great. We wouldn't stay here again.
Fantastic resort. Smaller casino footprint in the hotel which added to the resort feel.
The Aria Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas is just beautiful! Right when you walk into the lobby you can smell vanilla or some sort of good scent inside the hotel and also that scent can be smelled in the casino also so now you wont be able to smell that nasty smoke smell... This hotel is very modern and very high tech.. they do have wi fi there once you get your room key there should be a code on that back.. The Aria also has about 3 pools,private cabanas, and even like a nigthclub kind of themed pool party called LIQUID. Aria is located in the heart of CityCenter which means its only steps away from Crystals (modern shopping mall across from the Aria lobby), The Vdara, Veer Towers (residential apartments), and also the Mandarin Oriental hotel! Aria also has there own tram transportation that will take you to Crystals,Bellagio, and Monte Carlo (which is great transportation when its a hot day in Vegas)! The rooms at the Aria are very luxurious and modern.... Right when you walk in you are greeted with a warm welcome when the lights and TV turn on and plays soothing music.. and also the curtains open up... It's just amazing! In the room there is a touch screen pad and also a control panel in the room... With the touch screen pad you get to control EVERYTHING in the room! Like the lights,TV,Music,Brightness of lights,sheers, and curtains and much much more! With the control panel you can control less... the only thing you can control on the control panel is the curtains,sheers and brightness of lights and also there's a "GOODNIGHT" button when you press it, everything in the room shuts off and the room goes to sleep.. It's pretty cool! In the Aria there's also a Starbucks which gets pretty full at times but you can just walk over to Crystals and get a Starbucks drink over there (trust me the line there is way less full then the one in the Aria) Also there's a Cirque du Soleil show in the Aria Hotel called Zarkana it's located right in between the BUFFET and the convection center!
First of all, the building itself is dazzling.  Every surface is a new and interesting texture.  There isn't a rectangular room in the entire place -- every hallway and vestibule is woven into a wonderland of curves and arcs and gently leaning walls.  Everywhere you turn, there are surfaces of beautifully colored glass, fabrics, metals, wood, even water. . . The controls for the lights, curtains, thermostat, etc. are all electronic and controllable with the TV remote, and they're not too difficult to figure out after a few minutes.  The bed was luxurious and wonderful, and most everything else in the room was nice, all the way down to the carpets and bathroom fixtures.  During our stay, we had to call to get a light fixture repaired and get a replacement hair dryer, as both had conked out. .  . Services are all excellent.  The people are friendly and personable, and prompt. .  . But wow, everything is expensive!  If you take an item out of the room fridge for more than 60 seconds, they *charge you* for it.  There's no space in there for anything else, and they say they'll charge you $25 per day if you store other items in there.  So if you want to keep last night's leftovers cold, etc., be prepared to pay.  The restaurants range from expensive to extremely expensive; the spa will break the bank; and like much of the rest of Vegas, there's seemingly little or no place to sit down and just relax unless you're gambling or eating.  Aria feels like I'm trapped in a beautiful, futuristic sci-fi world where everything is oriented toward quickly sucking the money out of my pocket.  This was a nice place, but next time I'm visiting here I will only walk through the lobby and then spend my money somewhere else.
This hotel is pretty freaking awesome.  It is technologically current, everything in your room is controlled through a couple touch screens, your alarm opens the curtains, slowly lights the room, turns on the television, etc.  The bathrooms are gorgeous! I mean gorgeous.  The shower is huge, with a giant tub IN IT, which is great if you are like me and you want to shower after your bath because stewing in your own sweaty Las Vegas filth and then not showering sounds awful.  The casino isn't bad, I found the dealers to be nicer than a lot in Vegas.  They have some good food options (Not the CAFE ARIA, stay away), good lounges, play current, upbeat music, and a generally awesome ambiance. . .  The reason they lost a star is the check in line.  Checking in on a Wednesday, not near a holiday or special event that I am aware of, there was a 30-50 minute line to check in, depending on who in are group you were and what specific time you showed up.  That to me is an issue.  You fly in, or drive in, want to shower, or pee, are hungry, want a drink, whatever, and you find out that you are sitting around lugging your suitcase for another while.  You build a brand new huge casino, make sure you have enough desks to check people in.
I stayed here for four nights, and overall, I had a pleasant time. The staff was courteous except for one argumentative bartender from upstate New York. This dude doesn't belong in the service industry. I loved the pool area, spa, gym, the waterfall outside the main entrance was so peaceful and Javier's restaurant was my favorite.   The cucumber margarita and shrimp soft tacos were delicious!  I don't gamble, so I can't speak for the casino. Everything seemed very clean as well.  Would I return?  Probably not. It didn't seem that upscale, and as to be expected, almost everything was overpriced. One lounge charged $28 for a glass of red wine and they charge $25 a day to store items in the room fridge.
I was shocked to see that Aria didn't have 4.5 stars if not 5. I had a phenomenal experience at Aria, and I cannot wait to stay there again sometime very soon.. . My husband and I booked a room online at Aria to celebrate our two night staycation on the Strip. While making small chat at the Registration Desk, we told the woman that we were there to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary. Low and behold, we received our key after receiving very friendly customer service, and were on our way. . . After a long, long walk, we finally came to our room. Looking at our room, we were at the end of the very long hallway in the corner of the building looking at a gorgeous view of the Strip. Well, then we walked into the room.. . I'm a suck for technology, especially sexy technology that turns on your room when you walk in after a very long walk. The curtains slowly opened as sensual mood lighting raises in the background, smooth jazz starts to play on the television and I dropped my bags in awe. The sights, sounds and utter zen-like feeling I experienced within the first 15 minutes was exactly what I would expect from the Aria and then some. Who needs to walk around the Strip when you have that kind of view and all the luxuries of the Aria at your finger tips?. . However, if you do want to leave your room there is a tram that goes from the Aria to Crystals (which exits right near a Starbucks), Monte Carlo and Bellagio if you want to spare yourself a little walking. We use this tram often when we are on that part of the Strip, and when it's free there is very little to complain about. . . The restaurants at the Aria offer their guests a wide variety of cuisines, and each one we've tried has been delicious in every way. Many of the restaurants have Happy Hour menus which offer a more affordable price for customers that may not want to spend their food budget on one meal like myself. I would suggest trying Lemongrass or Julian Serrano for a meal and the Patisserie for Straciatella Gelato. So good, and definitely worth the price. . . The quality of this hotel is high, the customer service has always been impressive, and even their basic rooms are still beautiful and offer their guests quality accommodations  for a reasonable price. If you're looking or a little bit of luxury, I suggest staying at the Aria!
Impeccable customer service, front beginning to end.. . I decided to host a family event and wanted to do something nice. So I went with the executive hospitality suite. Check in was easy, fast and painless.. . My suite was amazing. 180 degree view. Spacious and comfortable. . . We had one and half bathrooms, a meeting room, a wet bar, living room area and our master bath and master bedroom and something like 4 or 5 TVs, I can't remember that exactly now.. . During our stay, our rooms were cleaned more than once a day. They were on top of their A game when it came to attending to your needs. . . The suite itself was up to par with all the nice electronic features. Truth be told, one of our favorite features was the toilet seat warmer. It was hard going back to our toilet after that.  And that nice big roman style jet bath. Oh you know I filled it up with bubbles, although I should not have. . . We had an amazing stay and I can't wait to do it again.
The hotel is nice and most of the staff is friendly....   however I had one of the worst experiences with the (we'll call him) "taxi attendant".   I am a great tipper when someone deserves a tip, however I don't feel a tip is deserved for someone that grabs my luggage from me (without asking) and hails down a cab that's already waiting for me.     As I was jumping into my taxi at the hotel to head to the airport at 5am, the "taxi attendant" said to my taxi driver (loud and only a few feet away from me) "wow, I've been working for free this morning, it's been awesome".   ARE YOU KIDDING ME, D-BAG?!!   He needs to be fired.   It's too bad b/c everyone else was so professional and friendly and he ruined it for me.
I'm late on my review but here goes. This review is based on my first and only experience staying at the Aria in June of 2013 for my Vegas wedding. The overall experience was awesome but there were hiccups.. . Displeasures- . I didn't get the whole welcoming with music and curtains opening when you first walk in everyone talked so much about, very disappointing. . 45 min to check-in was a little annoying, but I learned later that you can check in using your phone.. I wish the entrance to the Vegas Strip was a little more accessible. It felt like walking a marathon literally.  I really like Crystals, but I didn't want to walk through it every time I wanted to hit the strip. It was either that or the scorching sun.. The biggest issue was the fancy device that controls everything. This thing had a mind of its own. If I closed the curtains, the tv would shut off. It was so annoying I wanted to throw it out of the window. I ended up doing everything manually. Maybe it was defective but I was excited about using it just to end up disappointed.. Not being able to bring outside food to my room was such a turn off but hey that's the policy. I snuck it in anyway (don't tell nobody).. Do not, I repeat,  do not touch anything on the mini bar or in the mini fridge (from all the other reviews..this warning is self explanatory).. . Pleasures-. Overall, the hotel was amazing. Besides the issues above..I was in heaven. I had the deluxe king with a view  on the 14th floor and boy did I have a view.. I signed up 4months in advance on Aria's website to receive deals through text message and emails. I week later I was offered a great deal. I ended up paying 450 total (including resort fees) for 4 nights for a deluxe king, the city view was complimentary. Yeah I can hear you saying, " you could have went through a third party." Hey, I was getting married to the love of my life. I did not want any issues like some did during check in went through hotels. com  and they were told to call the third party vendor to rectify the problem. Yeah..no thank you.. The atmosphere and people wasn't bad either. This place just had a great vibe. . My room stayed clean and the fresh towels and linen kept coming.. I wish I could have pack up the plush robe, towels and bedding to take home with me. . The casino was awesome. The staff was really nice and friendly.. The food is very expensive but it was to be expected. Even though majority of the time I ate outside of the hotel, I occasionally treated myself to the best sandwiches I've ever tasted.. Check out was a breeze.. . For those of you who are using the reviews to decide if you want to stay, I say go for it. Your experience may be different from other folks. For example, I didn't get extra charges on my card, my room stayed clean and customer service was great. . . Would I ever go back to Aria? Hell yeah.
I am checking out today so I thought I'd write a review while still here. The main areas are lovely, the smoke smell is for sure not as bad a many casinos, and we've stayed at almost every M life casino here in Vegas. Self park is pretty damn far from check in, just warning ya. We had a standard room, but had to move as it was right over the Cosmopolitan's party pool and the thumping music was loud. if you want quiet as I did request a "mountain view" All the technology is cool in the room but doesn't work that great, seem to have a mind of its own at times, had to unscrew my nightlight as id did not fully turn off. The bathroom was really great. The linens on the bed were great but I'm not sure if my mattress is old or a really huge person slept on it but i had a HUGE dip in my side ( Aria if you reading room 18224, replace the mattress )  I wish the pools were a bit bigger, they do not compare to the Bellagio ones. The gym is fantastic, used it every day. the hotel restaurants  are hit or miss. Lemongrass is a really good and not scary expensive. BarMasa is good but in no way justifies the prices they charge. Overall we will come back, as we enjoyed our stay.
The Aria isn't as nice as the Cosmopolitan, but Hotwire calls it 5 star. The rooms seem small for a 5 star hotel. The service  is excellent and the pool(s) and gym are wonderful. Because Javier's opened in the Aria, they now have a really good dining option. . . I like being near LV Center just to walk around and get out of the "Vegas scene". I'd definitely stay here again, though the casino doesn't rate with the Venetian, Caesar's or the Wynn.
Recently stayed here for 3 nights and it was fine. Line at check in was insanely long. Getting to the hotel from the strip walking is a chore. You have to go up the stairs over the bridge thru the shopping mall and finally Aria. Rooms are standard. Nice comfy bed and good size bathroom. Much prefer Wynn/Venetian for overall experience and location.
This has got to be my favorite hotel on the strip! The technology available in the room along sets this place apart from all of the other, older hotels. For instance, upon walking into your room, the shades automatically open, showcasing the gorgeous view of the strip. You are also able to set different mood lighting on an alarm (dim the lights in the evening, close the blackout curtain at 2am, open the curtain at 10 am as a wake up etc).. . The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms have a shower/bathtub combination that is just insane!!
Aside from all of the walking it takes to get from your room to the rest of the casino and resort, I would say that it is a pretty good hotel! (And by walking - I mean, prepare to walk a really looooooooong time to reach your room! I rented a car this past trip and stupidly parked it in their parking garage (which is on the opposite side of the casino from check-in)! So after you walk through the entire length of the casino, you arrive at the check-in area and then re-trace about half of your journey to get to the elevators that take youup to your room. Good thing the place is air conditioned!. . In terms of our room, it was actually pretty cool with all of the automated controls that are controlled through a tablet - though over our stay, the system became pretty slow and non-respondant at times and the 'wow-factor' soon faded pretty fast. In addition, the layout of our room was kind of weird with the walk-in closets taking up a good amount of living space that could be improved on. Also, there was this one annoying light in the bathroom that would flicker - as it threatening to die out any minute. Calls to the front desk to get it replaced went unnoticed and were almost nonexistent. In addition, I don't know if it was because the cleaning service was lazy because we were at the very end of the hallway in the corner of our floor, but two of the four days we stayed did not get cleaned! Calls to the front desk again were met with empty promises about having someone come up while we were out of the room.. . One thing I did enjoy about the Aria was their fitness facility, which was included in their resort fee and not additional! The weights and equipment was new and seemed to be maintained and cleaned regularly. In addition, the bottled water and fruit complementary provided was a nice touch!. . While I didn't get to enjoy any of the other amenities at the Aria, I can attest that my room was extremely quiet and I was able to get some quality R&R and prep for my meetings. Additionally, the location was pretty central to the strip and conveniently connected to the Crystals shops. . . I have stayed at much better places in Vegas and also stayed in much, much worse places, and thusly would say that it is about the middle of the road for me. The casino was on the smaller side, but I was able to make some decent money at the blackjack tables so I'm not going to complain. . . If you were to stay here, one thing I would recommend if you are going to rent or bring a vehicle is to definitely valet your car! It will save you a good 30+ minutes (maybe more if you are a slow walker!) and is definitely worth it!
I love the Aria.  I was there in January on business.  This place is very pricey.  My room was worth every penny.  I was in love as soon as I walked in.  I was on the 12th floor with a city view.  My room was quite, the bed was SOOO comfy.  The decor was modern and comfortable.  My favorite part was the shower.  It was huge with a bench inside.  I just sat in the hot water every and really relaxed.. . I was at the Aria for a CPA conference.  The convention centers are beautiful.  Easily accessible.  The Aria provided us with healthy and well balanced meals.  For professional meet and greets this place is just great.  Lovely ambiance, it makes the clients feel very relaxed.  Great for business.  . .  I had dinner at an amazing Asian restaurant inside of the Aria, it was called Lemongrass!  The food was incredible.  It was so good I went twice in 3 days!  I had  a hot duck dish and some curry.  It was so delicious.  Again very pricey.. . I had coffee at a pastry shop.  It was delicious.  I love it, it was very strong.  I did not try any but the baked good were gorgeous.  They had a large selection of various pastries and cupcakes.  Very pretty.     . . I did a small amount of gambling, but only with the money I found on the floor all over the casino.  I sincerely enjoyed every bit of the Aria.  Cant wait to go back.  I am next month.
Well, the hotel did not disappoint. There was no "sophomore slump" experienced with my second stay; if anything,it was even better than the first one. Everything was better - the hotel experience, the room, the food, the casino games - everything. . . This trip was for a small conference that didn't have a really big itinerary, so I took advantage of some of the other hotel amenities and took some time to really walk around the place. The hotel is freaking huge - I came across lots of areas I hadn't seen on my first trip. It's bigger than Caesar's (even though all of the shops around Caesar's makes it seem enormous) and it's just as big as the Bellagio. HUGE.  . . If you ever stay here, be sure to get a city view room. I don't even know what the experience would be like without one since I've had it both times (and I always plan on doing that) but it really enhances the room. This time my view was a bit more towards Las Vegas Blvd. It was great. Next time I'll try to get a view facing the Bellagio (if I don't decide to go up to a Sky Suite).. . I decided to do a bit of room service on this trip and I felt like kicking myself for not doing it on my first trip. I travel a lot and sometimes the room service food at those hotels are kinda 'blah.' But not here - it was GREAT. Be sure you order the Fettuccini with chicken and shrimp - it'll blow your mind. . I decided to give the Buffet another shot (first time wasn't that good) and they redeemed themselves. Breakfast selection was great and the chef preparing the omelets were off the chain - best omelets I've had in a while (come to think of it, the omelets I had at the conference site were good too - guess it was a good week for omelet makers!). I ate at a few other locations this time around and I wasn't disappointed.. . And I also took the time to learn how to play some more games. Generally, I'm a craps man, but I've now taken a keen interest in Pai Gow. I left down pretty big so I'm hoping I can get a comp'd room or something on my next visit (hint, hint - LOL). . Overall, I enjoyed this stay 100x better than the first. Maybe it was because there was no major convention in town going on, but everything just seemed so much better - I don't know. But I will try to make sure I time my trips back out, whenever possible, to not coincide with big conferences. . . As always, the staff was super courteous. Thanks, Aria, for another great experience!
Loved the Aria!!! Everyone recommended the Encore and had me second guessing myself. I thought the Aria was wonderful, clean, great service from check in on. Great pool, the location was in the center and a easy walk. I was not dissapointed at all. Our room was on the 16th floor, city view. Lots of closet space and very comfortable beds. It's not a cheap hotel, but nothing in Vegas is cheap anymore. Well worth the money and would go back again. Lots of great restaurants and just a great vibe hotel. The gym was big with lots of equipment. Stayed at many hotels and by far this is my favorite so far.
Great weekend get away experience at the Aria this past weekend - really couldn't ask for more.  Got a good rate and woo hoo, on the 30th floor!  The ladies at the concierge desk were really as pleasant and professional as they come.  The girl at check-in was a little less than enthusiastic, probably because she was sick - please don't cough on my room keys and then hand them right to me!  Ate at Javier's, spent a few hours in the top notch spa facilities and played a couple rounds of of Black Jack.  A perfect place to base your Las Vegas trip, on the more desirable part of the strip away from most of the crowds.  Only hitch is our tv/music wasn't working in the room - but who's there to stay in the room anyway?
Beautiful hotel, huge.. . Service - great, friendly, consistent. Food options - good. Atmosphere- good for conventions/family. Rooms- huge, all rooms corner view, views and technology are great.. Location - on the strip, perfect. . . Like the hotel but didn't love because was a very corporate vibe and a little too large fort liking but overall a good property.
Loved this hotel. Really enjoyed the view with the curtains opening automatically when you open the door and the view was amazing. I really liked the combo bath/shower and double sinks - super convenient.. . The concierge asked if we were celebrating anything (which we were) and she extended our check-out time to noon (yay) and I received some goodies in our room for my birthday. I recommend leaving your bags in the car if you are checking in before their check-in time. Our room wasn't ready early so they text us when it was. They gave us the keys ahead of time so when we received the text we could just walk into our room and not have to wait in the line for check-in again.. . Only downside to this stay was the usb port technology. We couldn't connect our phones to play our music throughout the room which totally sucked. We didn't have enough time to call for service as we were getting ready to head out to a concert. Wish it would have worked - we spent probably 30 minutes trying to figure it out ourselves.. . All in all, I'd definitely recommend this hotel.
