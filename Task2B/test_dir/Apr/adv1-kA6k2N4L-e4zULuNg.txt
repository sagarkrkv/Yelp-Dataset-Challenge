Located between Binions and the Golden Nugget on four blocks of downtown Las Vegas is one of best marketing efforts this part of town has enjoyed in decades ... the Fremont Street Experience.. . Fremont Street is covered in a long canopy called Viva Vision with 12 million lights and 550,000 watts of sound entertaining tourists with short free light and music shows every evening on the hour.. . Current Schedule (Changes regularly).   7:00 pm: American Freedom 2 (Fri/Sat. only).   8:00 pm: Heart - Crazy on Vegas.   9:00 pm: Bon Jovi - Wanted in Vegas. 10:00 pm: The Who - Miles over Vegas. 11:00 pm: The Doors - Strange Days. 12:00 am: JVH - Signs of Life.   1:00 am: A Tribute to Queen (Fri/Sat. only). . Along Fremont Street, you'll find 10 classic (old) casinos with dozens of restaurants and lots of cheap gambling opportunities compared to most casinos on the Las Vegas Strip. This historic street is where gaming began in Nevada in 1931 besides being the first paved street in the city or first street with a traffic light.. . The Fremont Street Experience began in 1995 with the closure of the street to form a 7-block outdoor mall. It was obviously enhanced with Viva Vision 10 years ago.  What's next? Who knows .. a holographic Elvis, Michael Jackson, and Frank Sinatra trio?. . When you bore of the fun options on the LV Strip, simply want to enjoy some free entertainment, or need to find a casino with lower minimum tables and slot machines, then Fremont Street Experience is waiting in historic downtown Las Vegas, Nevada.
I didn't know what to expect going down there. I have read several books about this place, and had to check it off my list. It is a very surreal place, like going back in time. I expected to see Raoul Duke and his attorney around every smokey corner. This was way past what I expected, a harsh reality of what vegas really is.
Not the greatest show ever but something everyone should do. We had lots of fun listening to the live bands, getting drinks at the outside bars and most of all watching all the people and characters that are dressedup and walking around the street. We saw lots of funny and unique costumes including a group of topless nuns willing and ready to take a picture with you. The new zip line looks like it's going to be awesome. There are nice restaurants opening just off Fremont street and some really nice restaurants at the golden nugget hotel and casino.
Now this is Vegas!! I just walked up and down and ate dinner at a restaraunt but the street shows and all the lights are awesome sauce! I think it is something everyone has to go see when they visit!
The Fremont Street Experience is what old Vegas is all about.. You can't come to Vegas and NOT at least stop by.. It is nowhere as long as the strip, you can walk it in less than half an hour.. Old Casinos, street performers, a zip line above your head, stuff to see and do left and right.. It's cheaper than on the strip, they still have penny slots, I come here every time I go to Vegas with someone who hasn't been here before.
Great time! Way better then the strip! Great place to people watch! The slots here pay out way more then the strip. My fave was the ferris buller one. Good shops..& lots of "characters" walking around to take pics with you, we saw everyone from batman to big bird lol
I have been putting off writing this review because I couldn't come to terms with the fact that my awesome Vegas vacation had ended, so I kept this one hanging! Well I gotta accept it, and Old Vegas is not to be missed! . . The laser show is pretty fun to see.... So are all of the street performers and entertaining drunk people. The coolest (and maybe saddest) street performer was the 5 year old who did an entire impressive Michael Jackson routine. The drinks are strong and the casinos are fun to see! The cab ride from the strip will be about $20 each way but it's worth it!
We always love visiting Fremont Street. This trip was just as good. Lots of street performers and Arena entertainment were incredible. Performed 80s rock at the stage by the golden gate casino.
Each year, at the beginning of spring I take a small vacation - two or three days. I gather up my meager savings, pack my bags and head out to Sin City and one of my favorite downtown hotels.. . This year I stayed at the Downtown Grand - once the Lucky Lady Hotel and Casino, this modern hipster destination is just a block off Fremont Street. I must say, there is nothing like staying in a newly built hotel - everything is so shiny! Parking is a little tricky, there is only one way to access the front of the hotel and valet parking off Steward but we figured it out - self parking is off Ogden across from the hotel/casino.. . There is something very charming about the Downtown experience - it is classic, neon lit Vegas, unlike the posh over priced mega-casinos littering the Vegas Strip. There are at least 10 casinos within a small two block radius - easy to reach - you get tired of one, bounce to another. The Best Diner in Nevada is located there - Dupar's, where the orange juice is squeezed as you watch and a large Shrimp Cocktail cost a mere $2.99. The slots are looser than the strip and there is free entertainment around every corner - D.J's, bands and strangely costumed local performers that pander for your tips along with legitimate local artisans and vendors.. . Speaking of artists - there is a growing Arts District adjacent to Fremont Street. Had we another day to spend I would have loved to venture through it. There is also a Mob Museum and less than a mile north of Fremont Street is the Neon Museum and Las Vegas Natural History Museum, all three of which I plan to see during my next Vegas adventure.. . Yikes! Am I sounding like an advertisement?. . Getting back to the real experience - I was very impressed with how much improvement had been done to the area surrounding Fremont Street and at the same time disturbed by the amount of homeless and panhandlers that were evident along the walks. Also, for the first time I noted a marked difference between those on the streets from Thursday night to Friday night - Friday being a bit seedier crowd. However I was really pleased to see that more small restaurants had filled some of the spaces at the lower end of Fremont street - Mexican, Mediterranean and Asian eateries for cheep, quick and casual dining. For a special dining treat I recommend Hugo's Cellar, located in The Four Queens. Dress nice, bring your appetite and be prepared for a treat - make reservations and plan to spend $100.00 + per couple - it is worth it.. . Last, no Vegas trip is complete without taking in a show. Rock Of Ages at the Venetian was AWESOME! Full of great tunes from the 80s with fantastic and memorable performances by John Robert Hall as Stacee Jaxx and Matt Meigs as Franz. No wonder they can pack the theater every night. Save yourself some money and get show tickets half off at Tix4Tonight located in The Four Queens - if you're a theater snob and required front row seats order on-line. Tix4Tonight also has restaurant/buffet deals available - check them out on-line.. . Let me see, did I cover everything? Not even possible ;)
Everyone told us to visit Freemont Street while in Vegas and you sure get a EYEFULL of live entertainment! It's fun for ADULTS not a place to bring children REALLY WHY WOULD YOU BRING KIDS AFTER DARK TO VEGAS ANYWHERE REALLY? Anyways had a lot of fun here!
What has happened to Fremont Street? It used to be so much fun. This time, me and my friend couldn't walk a block without being harassed by someone for a variety of reasons. And the level of "entertainment" with the street performers was just bizarre. I didn't want to look at the bare asses of strange grown men wearing strange outfits acting strangely. What happened to the really good Elvis impersonators and the pretty showgirls? What's with Sponge Bob and the Minions that catcall female passersby? What's with the near-naked "angels" with painted decals on their buttocks (and a man standing close by watching their every move...is that a "pimp"?)? Everything just looks run down and sad now. But a sight to see nonetheless. A must see is the old rasta man that plays the best steel drum I've ever heard...he's further down near Hennessy's Bar...check him out. Oh....and Hennessy's made one of the best bloody mary's I ever had. The cover bands are cheesy good fun and you gotta love the sax player on top of the car playing good old 80s standards. I guess it wasn't all bad after all.
The Fremont Street Experience is what you'd expect Las Vegas to be - just on a much more walkable, enjoyable and less pretentious way than on The Strip.  It's old school, like Bourbon Street on steroids where instead of strip joints, you've got classic old-school casinos filled with real Nevada residents and keep-it-real patrons. The vibe was loose - no blazers, neckties, leather shoes, dresses or high-heels. The parking garages were old, drinks were cheap, the music was loud, the slots were loose, the roulette table not so forgiving! Get me? It's great! This is a come-as-you-are party and it's a refreshing change of pace from the opulence of The Strip. Cut loose and enjoy.
Fremont street was a GREAT experience. Deep fried Oreos are the bomb. And the zip line was soooooo much fun!
UNIQUE experience. I want to say it's fun for kids but there are some stuff kids should not be seeing present! The scent of weed also appears every now and then. 99 cent margaritas at all casino bars in the area.. . Every hour at night, the lights go dim and the Viva Vision which encompasses the surrounding area, plays music for around 5 minutes. You'll see random people dancing here and there! There is also 2-3 different "stages" area for music. Last weekend, one stage was playing jazz and the other had house/EDM music. It was like a free rave experience but for older folks. Weird sight but hey, they need to have fun too?!. . Not sure where to park exactly since we walked from our hotel at the Grand.
This review is if you come here during the day. We parked at a nearby lot and the first hour was free so since this place is pretty boring, we were in and out within that hour. I remember coming here when I was younger and I saw the light show and thought it was cool. I came here during the day and this is a tourist trap. It has no legit restaurants and the casinos are ghetto and not strip status. You will also notice that the crowd tends to be different than what you see on the strip. This is more for chill hill billy type folks and the pace is a lot slower here. You will see tourist shops and street performers but nothing you havent seen before. This is a drive from the strip so if you have a car, go ahead and come here. If you dont, it is not worth the taxi money. I will not be returning and I just wish I had seen the light on the ceiling.. . **TIPS**. 1) Do not come here during the day. It is quite boring with nothing to do. Go at night when you can see the light ceiling.
