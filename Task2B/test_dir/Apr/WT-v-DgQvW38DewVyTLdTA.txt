I got a great deal on Expedia for two nights in a hotel on the strip, which I obviously booked right away! I only paid 28 dollars a night which was the cheapest rate anywhere for the two nights!. . I arrived at the circus circus quite late due to a delayed flight, and was shocked to see a queue at the check in.. A queue at nearly 1am? Are you kidding me... Only two people manned the check in counter(there were others standing about, but not working) and it took me around 20 minutes until I reached the counter (after 25 hours flight and transit, yay!) . The first guy couldn't even find my booking, but he called for help and he was replaced by a really friendly, helpful guy whose name I sadly didn't get (sleep deprivation will do that to you). He put me in the casino tower and gave me a upgrade to a larger room for no reason at all! Epic friendliness.. . The room itself was large, roomy and clean, a large TV and free in room WiFi. It had a slightly outdated feel but for under 30 bucks? Who cares! However, NO fridge! Not even a tiny minibar, which really sucks.. I do like my water cold.. . As far as restaurants go, I only tried the buffet and the deli. The buffet costs 14,99 which is quite pricey, the food was fresh but the selection was quite limited. The coffee tasted rather bland and watery, the orange juice was fresh and "real" so that was ok.. They only really have one highlight: the omelette dude! This guy makes you omelettes on demand with your  ingredients of choice for no extra charge. And they're Delicious!. The deli was good, they have decent coffee and snacks, again pretty pricey.. . All in all I'd say it's a decent place to stay of you get the rooms cheap. I don't think I'd stay here if the rooms were to cost more.
Don't waste your money here! . No matter what your budget is, don't stay here, the room was descent for the price, but midway through our trip our room had been broken into and robbed, cash and credit cards gone. Made a report and security just tried to blame us in any way, and repeating time and time again that their not liable for any losses. . What made it extra fishy is 2 major red flags, 1) we never left any valuables in the room except that night. 2) we were out every night until the theft, the day after the theft we stayed in, only to hear someone messing with the door only to have a security guard walk into the room see us on the bed, wall out then finally knock on the door an make like the door was left open. Super fishy!. No matter what your budget don't ever stay here. It's not worth the risk, we are still waiting for their "investigation" to be finished.
Gross! The rooms were so old and smelled like smoke! There are definitely better places to stay, but this was nice and cheap!
Its an old hotel and is meant for the kiddies but when your drunk everyone becomes a kid again...lol  Stayed here when one night in one of there newly remodeled roooms...pretty nice, really comfortbale bed and nice size tv and free wifi that actually works was good, would stay here if was here for only a short weekend and if it wasnt summer time casue the walls are kinda then so you will here kids but if u come when kids are in school it is a good option..  Like the photo booth we usually hit that up sober and drunk at least once.  Slots so fun is a nice spot to hang out away from the kids and have good slots.
Very typical Vegas--I got a deal on Hotels.com for $119 for 1 night in one of the "Motor" buildings. It was a little trashy (some peeling paint and a worn out comforter), but it was totally what I expected. When booking a room, definitely find a deal and don't pay full price! Beware that there are multiple buildings with rooms, some farther from the casino than others.
I have been coming here since I was a small child.  Growing up as a Southern California Asian, family trips during the summer meant trips to Las Vegas and now after turning 21 I still take trips to Vegas, now with only certain members of my family.. . So now that I have established the basis of my credentials for writing this review, please read on!. . If you are reading this because you are trying to decide whether or not you would like to stay here on your Vegas trip.  I have a short and simple answer for you: NO!!!!. . If you have any sort of decency or standards or if you care about your family at all, DO NOT stay in this hotel.   . . This hotel is old, in desperate need of a remodel, has the permanent lingering smell of cigarette and it is in the older part of Vegas.  You cannot just walk out of the hotel and expect to be on the strip.  It is a good few blocks away from the center of the strip.  Not the greatest place to be staying with a family, oh and if you are over 21 and thinking of staying here, same answer applies.  No!  You will hate it.  It is far from the strip where all the clubs are.  Yes, it is cheap but it is not worth it.  The hotel is ghetto, sorry, no other word to describe it.  . . Every time I step foot in this hotel I forget how old I am.  Let me explain, the hotel to this day looks exactly the same as when I came here back in 1998.  It feels like a never ending time warp, nothing has changed.  Still smells the same, still the same shops, layout, everything is pretty much the same.. . The only redeeming factor and the reason why I still come here to this day, is the carnival games and arcade upstairs.  I loved Circus Circus as a kid because of the carnival games.  My dad would take us to Circus Circus and win us all teddy bears that my mom would later complain about because they would just end up in a plastic bag stuffed in the garage somewhere or donated to goodwill.  . . Circus Circus is an awesome place to take your children, just don't spend the night there.  The carnival games are super cheap, with the majority of them being only $1 and they have pretty legit prizes, comparable to the la or oc fair.  . . The arcade is pretty fun and it's big.  My grandma used to spend hours here dumping tokens into that one game that has a bunch of tokens that are pushed down by the little bar that moves.. . Despite it being stuck in a time warp, ghetto, far from the strip, old and smelly, chances are next time I'm in Vegas I will come back, just for the carnival games.. . Oh they have beer pong at the hotel next door, but I really would not recommend it.  The ball is rolling around on the ground and who even knows what years and years of build up is on that carpet.  I am not a germaphobe or anything but even that makes my skin crawl.
We had a great stay in the highest floor with the greatest view over the strip as you can imagine. Of cause the room had some minor finishing problems - but for a 3 star hotel it is one of the best you can book. Everything has been clean, really nothing to complain about. I can recommend this hotel to everyone who's looking for a hotel next to the strip.
A couple of years ago I went to Vegas with my California cousins.  It was my first trip, but like most Californians, my cousins are Vegas experts.  They knew everywhere to go and the best places to see.  I had such a great time that I came back and told my friends all about it.  They made me promise to go to Vegas with them.  I glibly agreed.. . When it came time to plan the trip they asked my advice about where to stay.  I told them a few nice places on the strip.  Then when it came time to book the flight my friend saw a flight+hotel deal that she thought was too good to pass up.  The hotel was Circus Circus.  She asked my opinion and I told her that this is the one place that I know to avoid.  She didn't take my advice and we ended up staying at Circus Virus...I mean Circus Circus.. . I assume that most people stay here either because they have children or because it is cheap.  If you have children, this is an okay place to stay because it is away from the flashy sin on the strip and they have carnival games and a McDonalds on location.  . . However, if you stay here trying to save money, you have made a mistake.  There are plenty of good deals to stay at NICE places on the strip.  Staying at Circus Circus forces you to take cabs to get everywhere.  When you stay on the strip you can walk to everywhere that you want to go.. . When you walk into Circus Circus you see the vestiges of the great hotel that it used to be.  I am sure that when it opened it was thought to be fabulous.  However, compared to the other hotels that are on the strip it looks shabby, worn down, and kind of sad.
Let me start with this:  I am NOT high maintenance.  I have stayed at Motel 6's on road trips and was totally okay with it.  But in Vegas, I expect a little bit better.  Circus Circus was a BIG mistake, absolutely disgusting.   We got stuck in a room a block away from the hotel/casino itself, next to an RV Park, where we had to carry/drag our luggage after a long day of flying/travelling.  It was so old and ghetto and seedy that I immediately felt concern for our safety, then sure enough two beefy security guards come storming down the hallway and bang on a room a few doors down from us and yell "Security!"  Yikes.  I was pretty mad at my husband then for booking this place.   I was afraid to take my shoes off inside the room but I guess it was clean enough.  The only highlight was the Keurig machine I saw in the bathroom but after the first day, I didn't get anymore coffee and had to wait over an hour after calling room service for more.  The view from my window?  The ass end of a car in the parking lot.   I felt like I was at a crappy motel.  Oops I forgot to mention the roller coaster El Loco in the kids section.  Awesome but lasts only a second.  And Vince Neil's Tapuado has a kick ass shrimp taco that's to die for.  But don't stay the night here.  That's a big fat NOOOOOO.
I stayed at circus circus on april 13th - 14th. . There were roaches in the room. . Casino staff was nice though.
Stayed in the Sky Tower the rooms were a bit small but ok.  Buffet was average.  I really don't have anything bad to say.  The Hotel staff were friendly and I really didn't experience any problems with the exception of all the walking back and forth from the Adventure Dome and the Midway where all the circus acts and games were at. (its quite a distance).  Great place for kids.  Just a note though, kids under 16 must be in rooms by 10pm per state law, however this hotel has a few exceptions.
Once again, Circus Circus did not disappoint! Me and my family had a fantastic time here. We arrived Monday And I had expected a large line to check in due to Spring Break but I was the first in line. Check in was a breeze, I had my room keys within three minutes, no lie!. . The room was clean and well organized. The last time I was here I don't recall having Keurig coffee makers in my room or any time of coffee maker for that matter. I was impressed my room had one and coffee pods too! Totally made my day..I was smiling!. . We had dinner at the Buffet and it was delicious,I. Only wish they had more vegetables, fruits we're plentiful.. . Staff was good, housekeeping was quick and friendly... . . Sure this Hotel is old  and I agree it may need a bit of a remodel outside but changing it may take away the charm and nostalgia..we love staying here. Thanks, see you in a few months!. . I won a little too so I'm a happy camper!
Not reviewing the rooms/hotel amenities. I'm just reviewing the experience of hanging out in the casino/arcade for a few hours. The arcade/circus area is really fun. It's probably one of the few truly kid-friendly places in Vegas. (Though, if you're bringing your kid to Vegas, I'm seriously judging you hardcore right now.). . The games a tiny bit pricey, but hey, you may walk out of there with a giant stuffed dog that you think is adorable but you really don't have any space in your apartment for it...like I did.
Good:. -Clean rooms, attentive house keeping. We called multiple times for towels and they were there instantly. -Great for kids and family. -Cheap rooms. -Ample parking. -Good Gaming. . . Could use work . -check-in slow. -parking, although ample, is a pain to get around.. -place needs some touch up paint, very faded in areas. . -signage is confusing. . Bottom line, clean cheap room on the strip. Good deal.
Gross. I stayed here one time and totally regret it.  At first they were gonna put us in one of those motel type rooms that weren't even connected to the main hotel.  But the front desk guy was nice enough to tell us to just go out there, say that you don't feel safe, come back to him and he can get us a room at the main tower.  . . Place is pretty run down/old. And it is REALLY cheap. You can walk to the strip from there..but still...I rather fork over more money to stay on the actual strip and get a better room.  Thank goodness I'm not a poor college student anymore!
