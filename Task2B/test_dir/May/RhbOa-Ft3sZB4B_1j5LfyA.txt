it's been quite a bit of time since my diet and schedule has allowed me a visit to a mom n pop diner, but i tell ya, waiting for mr. mama's was worth it. who would think you'd find a gem like this on the outskirts of vegas??. . thick, meaty gravy with bits and pieces of sausage, bacon and a sharp smear of maple flavoring all atop dreamy, flaky biscuits. a must re-order. . home fries cut so thinly, they were almost potato chips. . eggs cooked to a T.. . &a breakfast burrito that could rival kelly's back home. a smidge shy of crispy on the bacon, but it makes up for it in melty, cheesy goodness and a homemade habanero salsa that Hoang T. said he would drive 400 miles for. . & the best part? why, mr. mama, of course! "the wait's gonna be about 20 minutes, is that alright with you folks?" "would you like some water while you wait?" "this here is my grandfather...."   just like in the movies... . mr. mama, I'm so charmed to have met you; I can't wait to come back
Mr Mama, can I get some breakfast please?. . So Mr Mama's is a heart and soul Breakfast brunch place that is heard but not seen. Hanging out with elite Yelper HH and her trusty sidekick RM, we after many back and forth landed at Mr Mamas for a hearty meal before a few sneaky afternoon beverages.. . Like a lot of hidden places here in Las Vegas, Mr Mama's is located in a strip mall, with a small sign and a far from cafe or restaurant styled front of house.. . Once inside Mr Mamas, it is clear this business is a well Oiled machine. With a basic decor of blue walls, TVs and a few paintings Mamas isn't anything fancy to look at. This place let's the food do the talking. Ordering the Denver omelet, white bread toast and an ice tea from the menu, our group waited maybe 10 or so minutes for the food to start rolling out.. . The Denver omelet was great, your typical omelet done right! The Hash Brown Potatoes were a little dry but tasty. Others in my group all loved the food, particularly our golfer Freind Shaun, who destroyed his breakfast sandwich like some sort of golf crazy hulk monster with zero body fat and huge guns!. . Overall. Food: 4-5. Service: 4-5. Cleanliness: 3-5. Coming back: For sure
Great breakfast!  Extremely interesting biscuits and gravy.  Loved the multiple meat combo with the splash of syrup.  We were asked a couple times by what seemed to be owners/managers if everything was ok and everything was more than ok it was great!  We'll be back to Mr. Mamas next time we come to Vegas.  The employees seemed happy to answer questions and in a generally pleasant mood.  My breakfast date said it was the best omelette they had ever had.  This place really delivers and I can't wait to go back!
Very cute home cooked hole in the wall. The staff was very friendly and super efficient. The manager came over (MR. MAMA) And introduced himself, making us feel right at home. The food was great! I had the Cali omelette with hash browns and cottage cheese. The prices were super cheap too :)
I am calling Mr. mamma's the "Cheers" of restaurants.  Greeted graciously upon entering, this joint is obviously owned by A Greek family or someone who really fancies the color blue.  It's rare to visit when this restaurant is "slow" because every visit (and yes, I've made several) there is either a wait for tables beginning or ending. (Yes, the food is that good).. . Two dishes, two drinks for just under $20?! Say what?! No drive through, just good old classic diner menu items serving up fresh eats for breakfast and lunch daily.. . My counterpart swears the French dip is one of the best out there and without a doubt their tuna melt (served on rye) will have your mouth watering at the very thought of it, days later.. . Cheap delicious eats? Yes please! Thanks Mr. mamma's for your mom and pop shop; keep up the good work! (See ya next week, and have my tuna melt waiting!)
Very friendly. Great food. Great customer service.
I found this place thanks to Yelp and I'm glad I did. The gentleman at the door was very kind and sat us promptly although they were busy. Our server Ally did a great job and we were definitely happy with service. The Chicken Fried Steak is the best I've had! It has a non-traditional gravy with bacon and maple syrup! I heard "bacon and maple syrup" and I had to have it! If you're in the area you have to stop! I'll definitely be coming back!
I was in Vegas for a week and have been here three times, and for a reason. The food has been better than just about everything else I've had, and the price has been the best by far. . . Wait staff is nice, there is a greeter who goes around to make sure everyone is feeling catered to. He's kind of a bro but a still seems like a good guy. I will recommend this place to anyone I know going to Vegas.
This place is awesome, we felt right at home, the staff was awesome, friendly and attentive. I ordered the Cali omelet and the hubby ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs, both of the dishes were awesome! This is a place you must go for breakfast while in Vegas!
My wife and myself visited Mr/ Mama's twice this past week while in Vegas. The first day I had the chili cheese omlete which was incredible. I had never thought of ordering a chili cheese omlette but after reading multiple reviews, claiming that it was great, I had to try it. The chili goes great with the omlette and isn't over done. Mr. Mama's has some great tasting chili!. The second day I ordered the pancake and eggs. It was another homerun. They make their buttermilk pancakes from scratch and you can really taste the differance. We will be coming to Mr. Mama's for many years to come.
Chicken fried steak is delicious! The owner was very nice also. Top notch customer service. The eggs were the most surprising part. They were really really fluffy. Breakfast burrito was also pretty good but not as good as the steak.
Found Mr. Mamas on yelp. Great place. We went about 830 on a Wednesday morning. No wait. Service was fast and friendly. Food tasty and very reasonably priced. French toast very good. 1/2 order of biscuits and gravy just right. Gravy is really good. Not your typical sausage gravy.. Highly recommend this place. We will return.
Good food, great service, good prices. What else can I say.. . I spent a bunch of money in Vegas, saved money here. . I would give it 5 stars, but I just felt 4 stars was closer.
My business is a block away from Mr. Mama's, so I visit quite a bit.  The great thing about this place is that you are greeted by the owner when you walk in and again while dining, and again when you leave.  There are very few restaurant owners who meet and greet you in Vegas so this is really a nice touch. . . The menu is simple and the food is great.  Breakfast and lunch.  The tourists from Las VEgas Blvd flock here, amazing and well worth the drive.   If there is a line, usually only a 10 - 20 min wait, so no worries.. . I don't eat beef, so no idea about the burgers.  . . The CHEF SALAD may very well be the best of Las Vegas.  Also, Mr. Mama's makes most of its salad dressings, incredible.  . . Their french fry's are unique, not sure what is on them but so addictive.. . The hash browns are to die for.. . The Veggie omelet is also easily the best of Las Vegas.. . The tuna sandwiches are great.. . You really can't go wrong coming here...make the trip.
Excellent! I agree with all the reviews. It is like a small Cheers type establishment where the owner takes the time to assure everybody is happy. Who does that anymore? Wow! Very impressed. I couldn't decide between the French toast and the chicken fried steak. I got the French toast which was amazing. Then I tried my hubs chicken fried steak and I was like maybe we should come back tomorrow again. Yummy, yum, yum!
My boyfriend and I came here this past Wednesday for a real breakfast not on the strip. We love a good breakfast that is filling; Mr Mama's did the trick! . . The wait staff was friendly and attentive; the manager/ owner was there, having a sincere conversation with every single patron. Having worked in a mom&pop cafe before, I appreciated that the boss was just a genuine dude, unlike the doofuses I used to work for. The gratitude, kindness, and personality of the restaurant and its staff is just awesome. I just wish we had quality places like this back home! The attitude here spoke volumes about the business.. Thanks Mr Mama's for filling us up with a yummy home-style breakfast!! KCCO
We came here with my newly wedded cousins who wanted to eat American food while they were in America for the day, so naturally I yelp searched the area and found this GEM.. . As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by (I'm sorry I forgot his name) but a really nice man who looked to be the owner!  We never had to get anyone's attention to ask for service because they were just really good at coming to us often to check up on us! . . The food was also just as delicious. Everyone loved everything! The Denver omelet, the Cali omelet, the pancakes, the hashbrowns, the French Toast,  EVERYTHING. . . If you're in the area and looking for a breakfast/brunch joint, 100% recommend Mr. Mama's!
Excellent breakfast in Vegas. Nick the manager is very friendly. Food is great. Prices are good.
This was easily the best breakfast I've had during 5 days in Las Vegas. Good portions (filling but not obscene), fast, friendly service and the food was top notch. Try the Cali omelet.. . The owner was personable and attentive. I'll be back.
Really recommend this place! I felt welcome from the moment I walked in and the service was excellent. The food was excellent too at a very good price!
This place was amazing! The owner is pleasant and the staff is awesome. We had French toast and the Cali omelette and they both tasted great and fresh. I always order poached eggs and finally someone got it right! Great job Mr. Mamas, I can't wait to come see you guys again on my next visit to Vegas. The owner himself is a great guy who welcomed us and was busy cleaning, helping his staff, checking on customers and doing anything he could to make our visit more enjoyable. Such a rarity to see such great hospitality and quality!!!
I love love love this place. Whenever we head to McFadden Dale's hardware we grab lunch at Mr. Mama's. It's always good, but the word is out. Get here early or you will have to wait for a table for lunch. Full breakfast menu, friendly staff, attentive owner and some of the best burgers in town make this a definite do-over.
This place is awesome.  The owner greets us and stopped by the table to visit.  The food was hot and fast.  The bacon was crisp and flavorful. I tried the chicken fried steak.  Cooked to perfection with the tastiest gravy I have ever had.  The staff is well trained and friendly.  A+ for both good and service!
Awesome breakfast and great service! French toast are really good! I'm glad we found this place while visiting Vegas :)
Mr. Mama's is a hole in the wall that serves excellent food and is located about 3 miles off of the strip. I would recommend anyone to try them out. Their place is small but worth the wait if there are no available seats.
Whoever the guy was that greeted us at the door and took our names was awesome, super friendly and made us feel like they would do their best to get us in right away, and they did! It was worth the 10 minute wait! Service was above and beyond, super clean location, friendly staff, great food and fast service. No complaints! Definitely worth stopping in.
Fast, friendly service and a very clean eating area. We were seated promptly, and the food was fast and very tasty!
Great service, great prices and great food. Best onion rings I've ever had! Really worth getting off the strip. Burger better than A certain angry British chef's. Honestly! Forget Gordon Ramsay come here for a better burger and support your local community!
I was a little reluctant to go there at first. It looked plain and blend. We waited for about 15 minutes, which was OK ( wow, they actually had people waiting which was a good sign). The service was good but not great. The waitress was nice, but not very experienced. She kept asking me if I want to top off m coffee which was a little annoying. I asked her how big the pancakes were for my sons and she said there were "normal small pancakes". Well, let me tell you they were huge and great. The food was excellent and big portions and the prices were very reasonable.
Yummy food and very friendly staff.
This place is very popular and we had to wait about 30 minutes to get a table, the food was good and well priced, we had french toast with eggs, a pancake and burrito. The coffee and tea get free refills but I'm not sure how long you can make a tea bag last as they only refilled the hot water.. pancake was nice after adding butter and maple syrup all over it otherwise it's a bit dry. My husband loved his breakfast burrito with the spicy sauce on the side. Service was good and the host(/manager/owner?) was really pleasant and friendly. Good diner all round.
Amazing all around breakfast in a clean organized and happy environment. Everything cooked the way it should be. Pancakes, French toast, whatever you crave Amazing!
Food was good. Coffee was delicious!! Place gets pretty packed. But staff were all friendly.
Gotta love a place where you can get good eggs, hash browns, toast, and sausage for under $10 ($6.75 to be exact). The wait staff is super friendly and the place is really clean! Will definitely come back here the next time we're in Vegas!
Customer service made me come back. Everytime I come to Vegas I make a huge effort to eat here each time. The food is great but the service tops it off for sure.
Filling American breakfasts and very good service.   If you want better than Dennys or most of the strip, this diner won't disappoint.   The owner greets you and makes the round checking on customers, the servers are friendly and attentive, and Allie was very helpful.  While you may wait for a table because this is a popular spot, the food will be served pretty quickly.  . The chili omelet was tasty and filling with perfectly cooked hashbrowns. The coffee is okay, medium roast, and they keep refilling your mug.  My group ordered other omelets and pancakes and everyone enjoyed them and no one could finish because of large portions.  . This is a type of restaurant you'd find on a TV show for good quality and good service.  This is the place to go if you don't want a lot of flash, but want good service, good food and good portions.
Nice
Fantastic welcoming by the staff.....serviced right of way with coffee & orange juice....place looks very clean staff well groomed love it so far! Started with a cinnamon roll delicious!!  This place is delicious the service is great & prices are VERY reasonable.
Thought we'd love this diner based on yelp reviews.  Totally agree that the owner and his staff are amazing!  Friendly and super nice!  Prices are very reasonable for the most part. The restaurant is clean and we were seated quickly. I was really surprised, tho, when are waitress explained that the side of fruit I ordered came from a can!  Our meal seemed to take longer than it should have to come to our table and it really wasn't anything special. Coffee was meh. If you are looking for a friendly restaurant with filling, inexpensive food off the strip, then this might be the place for you.
Service is good, breakfast burrito was good - add avocado, that is a must. This kind of dinner is what makes LV a great place. Take the time and get away from the strip.
The cali omelette was very good, and I'm not the biggest omelette fan.  The eggs were nice and fluffy and not overcooked and the flavours really went well together.  Topped off with some cholula for a nice kick.  . . The prices are great, as good value as you'll find at a diner.  You may/probably will have a wait depending what time you show up.. . They don't have corned beef hash, huevos rancheros, or eggs Benedict which are all breakfast staples I absolutely love.  This isn't really a knock, I'd rather have them do foods well then add more stuff and half ass it.
Great breakfast place to hit in Las Vegas.  Nick is a great host for a Detroit Tiger fan. . . Excellent quality food and many breakfast dishes to choose from.. . Good pancakes. You can order hash browns or home fries.  Ask for hash browns and make them crispy.. . Get here early especially on the weekends it fills up fast.
Really nice discovery by one of my cousins.  It is just a really nice breakfast place off the strip.  I had the ham and cheddar cheese omelette with home fries.  Really tasty.  I also had the biscuit with a side of sausage gravy.  Excellent.  I am a big fan of simple food, being well prepared.  Service friendly and quick.
Very solid (but unoriginal) breakfast spot. Didn't see a single unique or interesting item on the menu but the short stack I got (2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 3 slices of bacon) was satisfying. Nothing was greasy, bacon was high quality and well cooked, pancakes were adequate. Not sure how this place has 4.5 stars over so many reviews due to the plainness of just about everything but I also couldn't point to anything bad about the meal.
If I could rate this place any higher then a five I would just based on the service alone!!!  Everyone was super friendly, especially the gentleman up front...  He had nothing but great things to say and treated everyone so wonderfully that I'm assuming he had to be the owner. . . The food was great.  Nothing special or exciting but what they do they do really well...  I always order scrambled eggs but never really enjoy them and for the first time in a long  time I did...  . . I will be back everytime I come to vegas Andwill recommend coming here to my friends
