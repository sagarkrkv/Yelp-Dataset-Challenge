Small, decent airport. They have a fast shuttle service to take you to the rental car pick up area. Fast and efficient baggage claim. No issues here.. . The terminals are filthy. This isn't their fault though, nasty dirty passengers who leave their trash under the seats are the ones to blame. However the airport staff isn't too quick to clean up after them. . . Pretty close in proximity to everything. Not a long ride from the strip or surrounding areas.
This airport now looks pretty neat.. I like the simple interiors.. . The slot machines on your way out seem kinda tacky but hey, this is Vegas.
I cannot understandwhy every restaurant was closed at 7:30pm ? I landed 15 minutes later than expected, dying for a drink somewhere and something to munch on while I waited for a colleague of mine to land 45 minutes later. I walked all over the terminal. Both floors. EVERYTHING except a little news stand was closed. At 7:30? that is unheard of. Nothing to see, nothing to do. Some of the worst airport food I've seen. Even the Starbucks didn't have fruit. Meh.
Considering the amount of traffic going through this airport, I think for the most part its pretty clean and up to date.  It's small but its filled with a bunch of cool amenities (nice restaurants, slot machines, etc).  . . Biggest negative about this airport is if you arent renting a vehicle, you almost are FORCED to take a cab out the airport.  But that's pretty much goes along with just Vegas itself.  But otherwise, it's pretty quick to get in and get past security.  Its just filled with a lot of people.
I've been through this airport about 9-ish times...they have slot machines so that makes for a great way to pass time, although I've been advised to stay away from the airport slot machines.. . The last time I went through this place was yesterday...and by far the best experience in all my times traveling through this place.  In the past the security lines have been far too long and the hold up due to a 90 year old tsa checking IDs.. . If you forgot a souvenir or two, there are plenty of stores to pick something up and you won't be paying double.  I picked up a shirt at a store for myself during one of my trips because I couldn't find anything I liked on the strip.  They also have an Ethel M chocolate store so be sure to pick up some of Nevada's finest chocolate on your way home.  It truly is the best!
Small and every terminal is easy to get to. . . I have never had a problem here getting in and on a plane quickly.
This airport sucks. It is outdated and not well managed. Lines are inefficient and take forever. People are rude and no one could be bothered. The restaurants are overcrowded and not a lot to choose from. There are no outlets and no room to sit or walk. If you live in the west, you are better off driving. This place sucks!!!
Terminal 3 is awesome!  It is new, amazingly clean and has free wi-fi that doesn't kick you off like in the main terminal. Security was surprisingly unoffensive and cool!  They were like, "leave your shoes on, leave your belt on, leave your ziplocks in your bag."  I was seriously throwing my sandals in the bin and unzipping for my clear bag of toiletries when the security guy repeated the instructions again!  I told him he was confusing all the LA people and he just laughed like he knew. . . There is a Coffee Bean and a pub in the terminal as well.. . Hint - you can take a free shuttle to terminal 1 outside door #55 if you need to meet someone in the main terminal.
This is a pretty crappy airport with directions when you're trying to drive to your designated terminal.  The signs totally sucked!  My friends and I looked for sign.  We saw some, but we missed it because after seeing one sign that was it!  And it took forever circling around.  I guess this airport is only meant for taxis since they should know the terminals like the back of their hand!  If you're new to this airport and you're not taking a taxi, my suggestion is to leave maybe 30-45 minutes earlier because that's how long it took to circle around once!  I guess the only good thing about this airport is you can gamble at the slots.
There some basic criteria I use when rating an airport: 1. Is it worse than Laguardia? 2. Is it clean? 3. Is it easy to navigate? 4. How are the food/retail options? 5. Do the employees make things pleasant or stressful? Vegas airport passes all these test except for one, being easy to navigate.. . I wandered around like a tourist in time square while trying to find baggage claim. It was horrible... I eventually found out that you have to take an airtran to baggage claim, which makes no sense in my opinion. Upon arriving at baggage claim, it was another 10 minutes to find out which of the many carousels was for my flight. Not fun. I should preface this by saying that I NEVER usually check my bag, but was forced to because I was one of the last people on a full flight.... . Other than that debacle, the airport is pretty awesome. Lots of great shops, good restaurants, efficient security line and a brand new look and feel. If it weren't a maze, it would be very close to perfect.
Had a few hour layover at McCarran International Airport, plane landed around 8:50pm and wasn't scheduled to leave until 11:30pm so I had some time to waste. .  . After figuring out what gate to catch my connecting flight at, I figured it was time to look for dinner, maybe find some place to grab a bite to eat and people watch, well its now 10 after 9 and everything is closed up , only thing that was opened was a small kiosk offering sandwiches, sodas, candy for sale. You would think in a city that never sleeps and in airport that has slot machines everywhere you look that they would have places opened to eat past 9pm, I could have even settled with Burger King, but nope it didn't happened. . . There are a few charging stations, but most of them are full, and you can find random plugs here and there to use to charge too.  . . The restrooms were just gross.. . I don't remember it being this way last time I was here.  Oh well. Needless to say I couldn't wait to get out of this airport, was happy to learn my flight was 20 minutes early.
I love this airport!  When here, I am either going somewhere great or returning to the greatest city in America ~  Fabulous Las Vegas!
Not nearly enough outlets to charge devices. Most airports have oversized chairs with USB ports and some tall tables  with USB ports and electrical outlets.  Not McCarran.  They have two hallways thathave about 12 outlets/usb ports. Not only are hundreds of passengers trying to use those, airline personnel were also trying to charge their devices before their flights.  Get with it McCarran.
Terminal 3 IS the way to Go. . Traffic flow is perfect. . . Drop zone departing other terminals is a zoo. People just stop and unload wherever. Cabs- overly aggressive. . Fly out on Sunday afternoon, Tuesday or late Monday afternoon if you can. . . No one at airport is overwhelmingly helpful, not a lot of collective knowledge.
McCarran is as much of a landmark to me as is O'hare! The slot machines throughout the airport are awesome. I remember the first time I came to Las Vegas, I got off the plane and saw slot machines within about 20 feet from the gate. I was so surprised to see that sort of thing but hey, it's Vegas, baby! Hell, there are slot machines in the grocery stores in Nevada, did you know that? Yeah, me neither. . . I love that movies have been filmed here. I love that I have walked through the same terminal as Morgan Freeman did in Last Vegas. I just love the history of this place.. . On my most recent trip, we got our luggage in the new extension. It was quite a walk, and that's putting it mildly. I think our bags were on belt #21 which is about a mile from the plane (I'm guessing). Good thing, I wore my sneakers to travel! . . Unfortunately, I was injured while working at the convention center so I left town on crutches but I gotta tell you, the staff that took care of wheeling me to the gate and onto the plane were some great guys! They took me to the bathroom, helped me grab a sandwich and something to drink, they even helped me with my purse. I feel very lucky to have had such a great experience with their employees. That's worth a lot more than the money I lost at the roulette table.
I find this Airport a lot easier to get to then LAX.  I just don't like the fact that we can't go see the people that are flying out off to say bye or chat with them while they wait... that really sucks.
Have a starbucks while you wait, iced matcha green tea latte, 1 pump chai, with organic soymilk. Always a smooth entry, lines move fast, view is great.
This is a very fun airport. There are plenty of ways to kill time and money with all the shops and the slot machines everywhere. Also has plenty of spots to eat and drink at every terminal and close to almost all gates.
McCarren is my way in and out of Vegas.. . I don't like the 4 hr drive from my city of angels so I try to book an affordable flight here and there once and again.. . McCarren is easy to get in and out post 9/11, so I have no major complaints.  I been in other airports that I like better so I cant give it a 5 but its cool enough.  They even let me store my bags there once.
Took almost an hour to get my luggage! :( This was flying Delta. Very uncool! And the line for the taxi was super long, but at least it was efficient. . . Checking in was quick. You can do self-check-in too if you want. Going through the security was ok. They didn't yell out the instructions before, so I had to get my stuff re-scanned because I didn't take the laptop out of the bag. You guys were supposed to tell me before if that was required. At LAX it wasn't!
I lost $5 to a slot machine. It was also very disappointing to be so close to the Vegas strip and not be able to go find some delicious food. . . Short layover (or at least, was supposed to be short, but my Southwest flight was delayed) meant not much time to explore. I ate a Nathan's hot dog, lost some money gambling, and that's about it.. . It's a little out-dated, but still, having the slot machines in the terminal is fun, even if I don't win anything on them.
It's cool, I guess. . How does one review an airport?
Las Vegas is a city of opulence and luxurious excess - but none of that exists at McCarran. For as much revenue as the casinos must generate, the airport sees little investment. The terminals are sprawling, so if you have connecting flights here, expect to walk a good distance between them. Dining options are pretty mediocre - with a bunch of knock-off cafeteria type options. Power outlets are next to impossible to find, and when you do find one, there's a 50-50 shot it will work. Enjoy.
First thing, you see is the gambling machines! Perfect for me..!! I love VEGAS!The airport can be very loud due to drunk people, gambling people, and of course flights Arriving. This place is very fast and accessible. It did take a while to get my luggage. There was a lot of stairs, and the taxi lines were very long.. In the summer it gets really HOT and musty outside. . . It's an international airport, you better be prepare for the craziness! :) . . Safe travels!
For how busy it is, McCarren is one of the easiest in and out airports I have been to.  I have to say off-site car rentals is a hassle and in particular Fox was bad in location, service, etc.   The new terminal is fantastic since it's hardly crowded and since I'm a fan of Virgin American and fly most frequently to SFO it works for me!
