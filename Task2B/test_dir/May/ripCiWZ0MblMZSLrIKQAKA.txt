It isn't a bad hotel, rooms are average. The casino is small and smells of smoke but it's not oppressive. . . The pool area is great. Lazy river, wave pool, normal pool. It's underrated for Vegas. . . The price is reasonable,but don't expect too much else.
I stayed here for the second time in my life this weekend and overall I was very pleased. It's true, the hotel isn't super updated as far as looks and it doesn't have Wifi in the rooms. But for such low prices, it is TOTALLY worth it. If you're going to vegas on a budget, this is the hotel for you.. . Also, the dealers and everyone working there is extremely nice and I received excellent service my entire stay. I usually stay at the Aria, and even though they have nicer rooms and are more technologically advanced, the service at the Aria is always consistently horrible. So, if you're looking for an inexpensive room and excellent services, definitely check out Monte Carlo.
Wow.  I can't put together a coherent review which would capture the "run! don't walk!" for anyone considering booking a reservation here.  The first assault is olfactory.  The MC "perfumes" their common areas and casino with something best described as Ozium and urinal cake at the Greyhound bus terminal.  What? Why?!?. . The "decor = tired"?  OMFG, my frat house last century was in better shape than this tijuana brothel.  Just pathetic.  We moved from 8th, to 9th and then 24th floor in sequence, a futile "Escape from Craptastica!".  Each floor has less busted stuff, but in the end, nothing even reach Howard Johnson status.. . The vaunted pool?  I would rather go to Rosarita Beach and wallow in a Papas & Beer cesspool of Nortenos Spring Break urine.  That almost captures it, I really felt as if I was in some Cancun sh1thole with a bunch of low-rent state school college kids on Spring Break.. . The Monte Carlo never pretended to be the Venetian, or Mandelay Bay, or Bellagio back in the day.  But a value proposition it is no more.  It's a tired old rag of a hotel with no pretense that they give a damn about anything, so there you are.. . The workout area and spa are definitely acceptable, I will give a gentlemen's B+ on this feature only.  Woe betide anyone who isn't physically off spa premises at 7:01P as you'll get the bum's rush at closing time.  But if you're a saavy consumer of value, $10 for the spa is a great deal.. . I'll wrap up this revue with a simple observation about the Monte Carlo for anyone who brings their laptop in case they're thinking of doing email and perhaps some work while enjoying a 5 day visit to the Strip...at the Monte Carlo, even the DSL is slow...
Stayed here over cinco de mayo weekend. It was a my first time staying at the MC and it was a very good experience. On Friday we had a studio that had a great view. The room was very spacious and presentable. . . For Saturday and Sunday we had a penthouse and it was beautiful. The bathroom was amazing. No problem sharing here lol the view was killer. Huge tv in the living room and bedroom. EverThe bathroom had a tv too. There was two bathrooms. A bar area. A high table that sat 8 people. Service was top notch.
Just passing through after catching the tram to and from the Bellagio. Never had the chance to stay here. All I can say is the casino area looks clean and well kept. Good mix of restaurants and stores.
Just a review for the pool area.... . We scored a daybed on a Thursday, because we thought the deal was a steal. $200 for a private area, and you can spend that $200 on food and drink? Perfect. . . We show up at 9:00, and the $200 daybeds were situated in the shade. We asked the attendant when we could expect some sun, and she told us "not until 2:00 or 3:00". . Hang on a second. I am from the midwest. I haven't seen sun in 7 months. I want some sunshine. She told us that we could upgrade for another $125...so we did. We wound up in the red daybeds situated by the lazy river, which was pretty perfect. The private area is choice. . . We started off with pina coladas and muffins for breakfast, and everything was off to an awesome start. The sun appeared over the hotel at about 10:00, and we basked our pale asses off. . . Then things kind of went downhill. We had $325 to spend on food and drink, which seemed manageable...but the food is AWFUL. Everything is heavy, greasy, and not what you want to eat poolside. The chicken fajita nachos and artichoke and spinach dip were our first tries, and we barely touched them. The other lunch options sounded even heavier, so we opted out. Sitting in 90 temperatures, I do not want a giant beef sandwich, or a large greasy burger. Blech. The folks in the daybed next to us said their flatbread pizzas were pretty soggy and gross.. . The fruit plate was decent. So...order thirty of those?. . When all was said and done, we wound up ordering a bunch of beer to bring back to the hotel, which is cool that they let you do. The bill with all of the service and included gratuity was $422. It was a nice experience, but not a $422 experience. So minus one star for the crappy food and price, and minus another star for not including the fact that the $200 daybeds will be in the shade almost all day on the website.
Good strip hotel and an excellent value. Centrally located. I don't much care for the theme or decor, seems generic.. . I like to access the hotel from Frank Sinatra Dr. It easier to access the parking lot and registration.
What was good: The price was okay, not great.  The room was clean.  The beds were fine.. . What was bad: The shower was terrible (fixed shower head, too low).  The internet access was terrible.. . There's no reason to say much more, as this review will get lost in the hundreds of other reviews.
Nice big hotel with comfortable rooms - good for the price if you don't want something cheap and crappy but also don't want to spend a fortune on a room you PROBABLY won't be spending much time in (other than sleeping). My husband and I didn't visit the pool area but as far as the actual hotel goes, we had no complaints!
For the price we paid, it was completely adequate. Our room was basic, clean, and had room to move around in for 3. It was annoying to not have wifi or a refrigerator, but it wasn't the end of the world. Next time, I'll probably stay elsewhere because Monte Carlo is top of the strip and it'd be fun to be closer to the other end, but really, not a bad price/location at all. . . Definitely go to happy hours at The Cafe and the steakhouse in the hotel. Cafe has $6 appetizers and $2 beer! Steakhouse has $9 apps and 2 for 1 drinks.. . Overall, fine experience. The $20 at check in didn't work to get us an upgrade, but it was a busy weekend.
I stayed at this hotel. All I can say is WOW. The place needs a remodel, an upgrade. Looks like I stepped into the 1980's when I went into my room. (Better then Circus Circus which makes you feel like you walked into the 1960's, I had to look down and make sure I didn't have bell bottoms on) ANYWAYS, these hotels are HUGE so it takes time to go back and forth to your room when you leave. Our view from the room was the top of another buildings Air Conditioning units. The cool thing about the Monte Carlo is the statue of all the womens bootys outside. THATS IT. Wait, one more thing, it was close to Dennys, McDonalds, and 711. Okay, now that's it.
Check your credit card!. I booked through priceline for a total of $99. When I got home, I had a resort fee of $22 and some random charge of $79.. I had to call their accounts payable department to get the $79 refunded. . I asked to have the resort fee refunded as well but was told to talk to the front desk supervisor. . i spoke with a woman that was not the supervisor and she wouldn't transfer me. . I explained that the two amex charges I was charged equaled teh two charges they charged me. . She explained in different words teh same thing - they can't refund a resort fee. . She then explained that the $79 wasn't an additional room charge but rather an error. . She didn't indicate what the error was. . Really, they just randomly charge extra charges and hope you catch it?. I wonder how many other people out there got charged extra and didn't catch it. . Trust level with this hotel = 0
this casino sucks dont stay here worst customer service in the table games buffet also one of the worst anywhere
To begin, my husband and I came to Vegas for our honeymoon meaning that expectations were high. . When we arrived to the hotel at 3:30pm we were told that we were unable to check in to our room until 5pm and that they would call us if the room was ready earlier. 5:05 rolls around no call, no room. I head to concierge to see what's happening and her response is "oh, your room is ready. Sometimes they get backed up on calls" that's it.. . During our stay, every single day a maid attempted to enter (let me assure you that we displayed "DO NOT DISTURB" remember, we were on our honeymoon!) Instead of knocking and awaiting a response, the key was already in the door followed by a knocking than entering. This killed the mood on more than 1 occasion. . . We have not seen extra charges yet but we will keep our eyes peeled!. . The room was clean, quiet, and nice. . The hotel was very well maintained.
We booked a reservation for a handicap room with two Queen Beds 5 months before arrival. My wife called 1 week before we showed up to verify our reservation and they stated we are all set!!.  When we arrived they had no handicap rooms available and asked us to check back every hour. We just traveled 8 hours by car with my son who has muscular dystrophy. He is wheelchair dependent and requires a ventilator to breath. After a couple attempts to get a room they booked us up on the 21st floor on the END OF THE ISLE. This is the worst case scenerio for anyone requiring assistance. My wife complained and was told " we dont hold rooms, we book when you arrive". I felt this was a bait and switch used by car dealers. I felt we were misled by booking a reservation, verifying the reservation 1 week before arrival and getting a room that made our stay miserable. If you have any handicap family members I would pass on   Monte Carlo. They do not care or understand what it is like need assistance.
Pro: cheap hotel prices, pool area,comfy beds, strip location . . Con: very thin walls, dingy looking, low shower head, no drink deals in the pool area, drinks are weak but tasty, spring break atmosphere . . Tips: your neighbor can hear everything from your drunk stumble in to Getty frisky. Keep it quiet if you want to remain low key. People leave towels on the chairs and often don't come back for hours. No personal items= free for all . Tubes are half price after 2 pm
Do not stay here. Bad restaurants, old small room, bad customer service. Nothing here is worth $300/ night during memorial holiday weekend. Except the location and the exterior. I should have listen to yelp reviews and didn't book this hotel. NO WIFI only the first and second floor ( which is lobby and spa )No refrigerator, no hair blow dryer.
Well unlike other reviews I read prior to my stay in Monte Carlo I have no complains at all!  Me and my boyfriend stood in Monte Carlo for 5 days May 19-May 24. Check in was at 3:30 but we got there at 9:30 am and we where helped right away! We got a room in the 30th floor and it was really quiet the whole time! We didn't hear anything coming from the room next door and we hardly saw anyone in the hallways all week! Me and my boyfriend are not picky at all and we thought Monte Carlo was great! Good location and overall a nice hotel! If and when we go back to Vegas we would def stay in Monte Carlo again!
On arrival we were stung with 20 dollar/day "resort fee", per day plus tax.. . Bed's were comfy, but walls thin, loads of teenagers partying.  We just stayed on the third floor, so not great views.  It was better value than other hotels in the area.
4 stars for the price and location...Had spa suite with incredible view of city center, strip and pool. 0 stars for cleanliness as our room had mold around spa tube and an item I shall not mention stuffed between the couch cushion.  Thank God my wife didn't see it as she would have been physically ill.  We never sat on the couch after that.  Staff was great and very helpful although I have not mentioned our room matters to them yet.  Pool was o.k but cramped and the lazy river was just too small to attempt to navigate the kids on a Thursday afternoon, I'd hate to see it on a weekend.  Very smokey place and just not kept up like it should be.
I love the Monaco Suites! The hotel is clean, smells fresh and has an inviting atmosphere.  The buffet was a good value for the price and the cafe is just as good. The pool area has a lazy river and a wave pool. If you can find your way through the maze of retail shops look for the micro brew Pub!!!
Nice hotel. Had a fridge in our room which is always good to keep out drinks cold! The pools were cool. The wave pool had the dj. Thought it was weird that they had wet t shirt and booty shaking contests with lil kids there. It should just be an adult pool.
Nasty!!! Worst hotel ever!!. Reserved a spa suite for my b-bay ,when I got on the room the shower had human hair all over the tile on the floor and very old and run down then the actual spa floor had paint all over it in an attempt to "renew"it and it was chipping off in the water and stabbing me ...switched rooms and the second room the spa doesn't even run!f*luck this place ..if u care about your health DONT stay at the Monte carlo!
I think that the Monte Carlo has seen better days. It was once pretty dang nice and one of the best placed to go on the Strip, but it is starting to show some wear and tear. There is a -5 Bar, but it isn't the better one. I can see that there is some renovation going on, so that might mean that the place is on the up-swing. It is right in the middle of the Strip which makes it prime for those that want to stay in a central location. However, I think that I would not likely get a room here and opt for one of the newer, shinier places.
