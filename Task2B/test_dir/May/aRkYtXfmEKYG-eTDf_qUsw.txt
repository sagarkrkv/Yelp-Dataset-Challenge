Best bar in town for mix-drinks / cocktails...you named it, they will make it to perfection. Try Mojito (or Peach Mojito - in season only)...fresh squeezed juices, accordingly for the cocktails. Mixologists are cool and knowledge. Group of three or four is perfect. Two are best, since you can chill at the bar. Cheers!
First time here. It's got a cool vibe to it and the setup is interesting. Bustling place, came to meet friends from work and try their Mac and cheese. It was okay, nothing amazing but good nonetheless. Got a chocolate croissant but it tasted meaty so I returned it. They were nice enough to give me a refund.
Came here to study - because of the music, this place was louder than Saturday night bar even though it was early afternoon on a weekday. It is also full of out-of-work hipsters. Headed for a more coffee-shop like coffee shop.
After cartel in Tempe this is one of my favorite coffee shops in Phoenix! The staff is great! And the owner is often there so quality is always at the top.  The only real problem with the place is it's so popular it's often very crowded, if you want to meet someone there make sure to show up early so that you will have a spot. Outlets are plentiful and it's a great place to get work done. The food is delicious (and if you don't like it pane bianco is next door) and the pastries are dangerously good. The coffee is excellent and roasted in house. They're also surprisingly affordable, except for the meals and alcohol which aren't cheap but Aren't too expensive either.
Went there with a friend last night and had an amazing time. Atmosphere is great. Great background music and the coffee and pastries were a winner.
LOVE this place. Great coffee and pretty pastries as well. Love the environment and decor. It is great for just hanging out or getting some group work done. I love that they have a room where its noisy, a room with a TV and a quiet study room. In addition, there is a little outside seating area. Not a big fan because youare just looking at the parking lot, but it is Phoenix, so I didn't expect much. Usually I can't study when there is a lot of noise, but for some reason I was able to get a lot of work done there. AND there is a lot of outlets and FREE fast WIFI.
The Internet SUCKS!  I've been here several times and the Internet is very intermittent.  If they fixed it this would be 4 stars.  If they didn't charge $1.50 for a single normal sized cookie it would be a 5 star review.  Otherwise the atmosphere is pretty great (though a bit on the hisptery-side, nice selection of food, variety of seating, and the mac and cheese is fantastic.
Lux has recently become one of my favorite places in Phoenix. I always find myself craving their coffeee and if I lived closer I would be there probably every day. The type of customers who go to Lux greatly varies depending on the time of day. I showed up one day at 8 am and the line was to the door with mostly middle age- older customers. But then you get there at 9 pm and it's 100% full of hipsters. The drinks at the bar are great. I usually have no idea what I want but the bartenders are wonderful about creating something I never knew I loved. My only issue is that it can be difficult to find a seat sometimes. Also, their macaroni is fantastic. Don't think, just order.
What can I say?  Lux is a good spot with good food andgood coffee. I had a salted chocolate chip cookie with my latte last night and it was delicioso.  I frequent this joint at night to work on the computer.  It's comfortable and the people are generally friendly.  A few of the reviews whine about the "fake Scottsdale" people and the "hipsters" that they have encountered at Lux.  Are you kidding me?!  The people are half the reason I go here- sightseeing!  If you're looking for a place where everyone looks the same and acts like a robot you'll be better served getting your caffeine at the ubiquitous coffee shop with the 'baristas" donning the green aprons.
Go to Starbucks. This is a place to be seen, not a place to enjoy coffee or get work done.
Best almond milk latte ever.  No need for sweet.  Love this place,  for coffee or wine or good local grub.  But what made my day was the apricots! You can keep your spotty, sad bananas, Starbucks!   I'll take 5 apricots,  please.
Love Lux. Great place to go for some coffee & chill with friends. Usually busy so plan to parallel park on the street (free) but luckily there's usually a seat available. If you're coming with more than 3-4 people plan to search for a seat. Free wifi & hipster-gazing. Also has food.
This is the best coffee bar I've ever been to, and I've been to a lot of cool coffee places. First off, the coffee is really good, which is obviously the most important thing you look for in a coffee place. But Lux was so much more than that. They had an incredible baked goods selection (the apple tart was delicious), a full menu of interesting foods, a mixologist on staff, and even a live DJ. That's right, a DJ, and I went on a friday afternoon. . . I went for lunch so I got the dutch pancake with potatoes, broccoli, spinach, cauliflower, topped with cheese. It was one of the most unique meals I've ever had but also one of the best lunches I've ever had. . . There was a good amount of seating, both outside and inside. Was the place hipster? Of course. Everyone had been mentioning that in their reviews. I haven't been able to figure out why white dudes with dreads and gauges makes coffee and food better but it does. That being said, Lux is not in short supply of said hipsters. And everything is unbelievable.
I love this place. Great decor, friendly staff and amazing food and drink. Their coffee is delicious and they make a great Old fashioned. I love stopping here when I am in the area. This place is doing it right and I hope they continue with what they are doing. I am a fan.
Great coffee shop.  Quick efficient service, outstanding bakery items, great breakfast items, and wonderful coffee.. . Lux is a perfect morning stop.  Highly recommend.
Beat coffee shop on town, even the iced coffee  is great and has not been sitting in a jar for 24 hours, this place is slammed in the morning for a reason , best place  simply . Put!
this has got to be the best, most amazing little  coffee place i've ever experienced  besides cafe trieste in san francisco!! wish we had this in boston...
YES and YES... . . Awesome coffee shop. Beautiful ambiance and great tasting coffee. Breakfast was good. Customer service was nice. If you're in downtown PHX.. do yourself a favor and visit!
