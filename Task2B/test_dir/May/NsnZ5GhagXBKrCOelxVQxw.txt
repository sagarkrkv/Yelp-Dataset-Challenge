This is a cool, very lively restaurant in the canal shoppes between Palazzo and Venetian. The sushi was good, the wine was okay, the Seabass Miso is enough to bring bring me back again. That was seriously the best tasting seabass I've ever eaten.. . We also had the Seaweed Salad, california rolls, and salmon/avocado rolls, along with some edamame. I love seaweed salad, but this one pretty much had ZERO taste. The rolls were good, although my husband complained that the rice was too sticky. . . One point I don't want to forget to make is about the service. I thought our server Phil was excellent. He was very knowledgable about my husband's need to eat gluten free and if he didn't know something, he did not guess like so many people do...he went to the chef and confirmed. Great job Phil!. . While I'm not sure I'd return for another meal here, I would return for a pre-dinner app to eat that Seabass Miso. So worth it!
The best sushi I have ever had....hands down. You can't go wrong with any of the rolls but my favorite was "El Topo." The blue point oysters were outstanding as well.  The service was excellent. Can't wait to go back!
Sushi Samba is a delightful mix of well done sushi and arguably better done meat tapas.  The yellowtail sashimi came sitting in an out of this world jalapano sauce that I kept to dip almost everything in.  The lamb chops were perfectly cooked in an amazing slightly sweet sauce that my table loved so much, we ordered another round despite being mostly full.  Great concept of food fusion, thank you yelp for leading me here!
Christine is amazing sever, manger very nice provided complimentary scallops and food beyond amazing!  Lobster samba rolls, tempura vegetables, red miso mushroom soup, shashito peppers, cucumber martinis and samba split are amazing!
About 8 of us waltzed into the Venetian and headed straight for Sushi Samba. Right off the bat, the familiar names of food from my country (Peru) put a huge smile on my face. Anticuchos, Pisco Sours, Ceviches, tiraditos, rocoto.. I was so excited to incorporate my undying love for sushi along with staples from my country. . . I kept mum about being Peruvian but after ordering a Pisco sour and a cusquena for my colleague, the waiter quickly caught on. We did something unusual, and we let the waiter decide our feast for the evening.. and boy was it a feast fit for this pricness right here. . . I can't tell you how many rounds of food came.. but they were ALL heavenly. From the ceviches to the makis to the dumplings to the sashimi to the moon and back. It was absolutely wonderful. . . We have several Sushi Samba where I live in Miami.. but it's never the same eating there as it is in the Venetian in Las Vegas.. but then again, nothing is quite like Vegas.
Inventive sushi, great service, and decent cocktails.. . Been here twice now and both times were solid. The food here is excellent and there are many dishes that I have never seen at a sushi restaurant before.. . The atmosphere is great inside, but is in a more sleepy party of the complex (Palazzo is one of the quieter "big" resorts on the strip).. . The cocktails could use some improvement. Given the price and the clientele, I think they need to bring in a mixologist to redo this section of the menu.. . Last but certainly not least is the service. VanessaG was extremely accommodating as our server. We came in towards the end of the night and she had a great attitude. Also, the manager Jason P. was awesome. He checked in on us a few times and went out of his way to make my GF's b-day special. Big fan of these two.
Probably the worst sushi spot I've ever been too. Place is extremely loud. Beyond belief. Waitress is trying to be a sales rep rather then actually help with the foods etc. . . The food portions were very small. Not my style of food but to each their own. . . Not sure what the hype is all about
This restaurant has excellent customer service. My reviews weren't originally fantastic regarding the food, but the staff has been very attentive and reached out to me to come back. . . Can't wait to try this place again!
Jimmy our waiter definitely took care of us. We were going to see Le Reve and time was of the essence. He asked what was price range for each person, there were 4 of us, and what we liked & disliked.  Then we just sat back and he brought out amazing dish after dish to us. We were not disappointed with any of his selections. . . The vibe & atmosphere was great and food amazing. Highly recommend this restaurant.
Fantastic food and great service. Had reservations on a Sunday night and all the staff members was very attentive to our table. Every dish we had was mouth watering. The tuna tataki was so delicious. The Sao Paulo roll is unlike any sushi I've tried - the blend of flavors and texture is so tasty. Even the drinks we had were very good. I'm looking forward to going back next time I'm in town.
Not impressed!  Went here for happy hour and it was empty (usually a bad sign)!  Our waitress/bartender was snooty and not very helpful.  I hate that because for us part of the experience of sitting at the bar is chatting with the bartender, but unfortunately that didn't happen here.  The happy hour appetizers were tiny and we calculated that each small bite we took cost about $3 which is probably normal for Vegas, but we had found other wonderful happy hours that were a much better deal and a lot more fun.  I really wanted to like this place because the menu looked interesting and it had great reviews, but will not be returning.
Excellent food. Sashimi was superb. Ate with kids and they were very accommodating and adjusted spiciness if the food for children. Excellent service
Had the most delicious meal at Sushi Samba this weekend! The waitress suggested we do the sampler / tasting option. We set a price point and told her our likes and dislikes...and from then on it was nonstop deliciousness! We truly liked everything that was brought out. For 4 girls, we set a price point of $50 per person and were beyond full by the end of the meal. Next time I would probably do less sushi rolls and more of the other goodies on the menu. Will definitely be back!
We were really disappointed in this place.  . . I made a rez for the first night my girls and I were in town. The service was spotty and the sushi was meh.  . . That's all I really have or want to say.  Pass and go somewhere else.  Especially if you're looking for good sushi - find another spot.
DO NOT EAT HERE! FOUR of us in our group got FOOD POISONING!!! Completely awful food too! Should be paying for my ER bill as well. Go eat at RA Sushi in Vegas on thecstrip instead, much better place.
We decided to go to SUSHISAMBA our last night in Vegas because we were really wanting to go to a nice sushi place and I read really good reviews. If I went back to Vegas I would not go here again.  Very loud and we were stuffed onto a tiny table where it felt like we were sitting at the same table as the people on each side of us.  Our server was not that polite and kind of pushy with things and very rude and snappy to the bus boys. The sushi was good but no where close to the best we've had. I understand prices in Vegas and especially certain hotels but for the portions and quality I would not go there and pay those prices again. Pretty disappointed overall.
Pain in the Tanis!  We ate here a few nights ago and absolutely hated it, mostly thanks to our terrible server, Tanis.  She refused to bring us any menus and assured us she would customize a meal for us that we would love... I left hungry.  There were 6 of us total, 2 of us don't eat any fish.  We told her that in the beginning when she was refusing to bring out menus.  For our second course, she brought out raw fish for the fish eaters and cooked fish for the non fish eaters... wtf?  I waited around 15 minutes for her to come by again so I could get something different to eat.  When I was finally able to flag her down, I asked if the two non fish eaters could get something non fish, to which she replied, "I brought out two extra fish dishes for everyone else.  There's nothing you can eat for this round."  That's obviously terrible customer service.  She could've brought us out another two mediocre kobe mini tacos like she brought for us the first round, but she obviously doesn't care about her customers experience in her restaurant.  I had also ordered a drink from her which I suspect she intentionally forgot since she knew I was upset with her, it was her way of getting back at me.  When I complained about it to my friend she conveniently was able to hear me that time and asked, "Was there something about another drink?"  I told her I didn't want anymore drinks from her because I was not going to play her little immature, power games.  So instead I left the restaurant and walked to a nearby bar, came back to the restaurant and finished my drink there so that she wouldn't get anymore of my money.  Tanis is the worst waitress I have every come across in my entire life, and that's just after a trip to London, the city of zero customer service.  If Tanis doesn't like serving people, maybe she should look for a new job?  Thanks for the memories Tanis, I can't wait for you to see this!  :)
I have been to Sushi Samba 3 times now and every time I am blown away.  I love their service and their food - the kids' bento box lunch is an adult-sized portion and the kids gobble up every last morsel.. . I can't think of a better combination than Japanese food and grilled meat - the best of both worlds!
I didn't know what to expect with Japanese/Brazilian fusion, but this place exceeded my expectations. We tried a mixture of classic sushi, miso soup and some fusion dishes. The sushi was exceptionally fresh with unique presentation. . . Fusion dishes to try: . El Topo (roll), which had salmon, jalapeno, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion. It sounds absurd and it was just that... absurdly delicious. . . Carnaval (roll)- shrimp, avocado, yellowtail, soy paper. This one wasn't as good as El Topo, but still offered a cool twist on a typical Japanese favorite.. . Miso soup - it was a great miso but with added cilantro to lend to the Brazilian side of the restaurant. Amazing twist!. . Wagyu gyoza - kabocha puree and su-shoyu dipping sauce made this sweet, tangy, and a little spicy. We ended up ordered another batch after downing the first order in 30 seconds. So good!. . We also ordered some Robata items, which were great, but paled in comparison to the fusion dishes and the sushiitems. This place is absolutely worth a stop! Also, the price is right. We ordered a ton of food for 5 people and the bill was reasonable!
I am so glad we had the chance to dine at Sushisamba our last night in Vegas! Our waiter Michael was fantastic and made the entire experience that much more memorable. We literally loved everything we ordered. Be sure to make a reservation because it gets very busy, and if you're celebrating anything let the hostess know. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and they gave us a free small dessert.. . Small plates:. Wagyu Beef Goyza - do not miss this! It was incredible - every table around us had also ordered it and we were in unanimous agreement.. . Yellowtail Crispy Taquitos - light & delicious with an Asian dressing on the greens.. . Robata:. Ribeye - it's described as spicy but it's not, just has subtle spic flavoring and was very tender.. . Sea Bass - Phenomenal. There's a reason it's the most popular thing on the menu. Melts in your mouth with an amazing miso glaze.. . Samba Rolls:. Neo Tokyo: Similar to a spicy tuna roll flavor but with tuna both inside and on top of the roll. Fresh and great flavor.. . Dessert: . Fried doughnuts with cream dipping sauce - oh my goodness, sooo good. Not a light dessert (fried dough) but ah-ma-zing.. . Since we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, they gave us a free small dessert of green tea ice cream pops dipped in chocolate with pop candy crust, which was cool and refreshing.. . We will definitely be back on our next trip!
Had another great experience here- Sushisamba is a must on every trip to Vegas for us.  Even though we've been there before, it was so much fun to give our preferences and budget to our server and let her surprise us.  Tanice, our server, was so knowledgeable and personable and made us feel like the only table in the restaurant.  Definitely request Tanice for your next visit, you'll be so glad you did!. . Everyone we encountered seemed to take pride in their work and genuinely care about our dining experience.  We had made our reservation in-person the night before and the hostess remembered us.  Then, the manager came to our table to pour our wine and personally thank us for visiting again.  The expediters who brought food to our table knew that Tanice had created the menu, so they took time to describe each dish to us since we didn't know what had been ordered.. . Thank you, and we will definitely be back soon!
Came here with my gf and my cousin and his wife. He won big gambling so he said it was his treat. Bad move cousin. We were eating kobe beef and ordering up expensive sakes. It was great. I got wasted. I inhaled some ramen at the end of the meal. Great times.
