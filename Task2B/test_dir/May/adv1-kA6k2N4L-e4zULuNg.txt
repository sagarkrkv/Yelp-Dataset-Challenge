This place made me laugh so hard. This is a tourist trap if there ever was one. But I really loved all the over the top old school cheesy Vegas feel that it has. There were tons of weirdos available for a small fee for photo ops. I saw fat man brides, Chipndale dancers, show girls/guys, street performers, playboy bunnies, Michael Jackson anda lot of homeless people begging for money. . . The light show over head was cool and they have a few stages with performers playing live music. Tons of trashy interesting people make a great evening of people watching. . . This is a must see in the down town area.
Fremont Street!!.  1250 LED!. . 4~5km10. . . !. !
This is a people watching mecca.  There are things that I've seen here that cannot adequately be described with mere words.  You have to be here to believe your eyes.. . I'll take Downtown Vegas over the Strip any day of the week.  I don't mind the seediness, the people dressed in dirty Muppet costumes or the meth heads pan handling for change.  It's all part of the experience, baby.. . There was a band playing on the weekend we were here (April 25) who did a lot of AC/DC and Led Zeppelin covers.  They were really quite good.  The lead singer has a great voice and I couldn't tear myself away.  I understand why they don't have seating (better to keep the gamblers spending money in the casinos), but it sure would have been nice to pop a squat.
You need a very high tolerance for panhandlers, buskers, nudity, and crowds to enjoy Fremont Street. I got a huge kick out of getting my sixteen year old nephew's picture taken with a couple of cute "showgirls" and having my brother arrested by two sexy "cops". On the flip side, it *is* distressing to see young children dancing to support their parents and to see addicts pass out and fall off their levitation illusion contraption.  . . The overhead light show is a technological marvel and everywhere you look there's something to see. On the whole, Fremont Street is loud, colorful, wild, and completely overstimulating, but everyone should experience it once.
WHY would you go to Vegas and not see the BEST SHOW IN TOWN?
This was my first visit to the Fremont Street Experience and it was fun, simply for the people watching. I'm not really a drinker myself but I enjoy watching people after they've been drinking for a few hours! If you don't like crowds or lots of noise, this isn't the place for you. As you walk around, you will also encounter showgirls, cowboys, nuns with their boobs out, and all sorts of other weird things. I was surprised that I saw parents with their younger children walking around. The overhead LED panel that was displaying an aquarium scene was really cool. You can also hipline down the middle of Fremont Street if you are interested. Definitely a fun and happening place. Lots of police around so always felt safe.
I go to vegas twice a year and have never been to this area. So finally on my recent trip, my friends convinced me to give it a try. . . The feeling I got when we arrived there was more like of a fair. The electric light show overhead was totally awesome. They were playing Bon Jovi the entire time and I loved it. They also have stage for live bands. . . Lots of souveiner stores also. Their quality of course is not as great as the ones at the strip hotel's gift shops, but if you're looking for some simple stuff like key chains, this is the place to buy them. Its 3-4x cheaper. Speaking of cheaper, my friends told me about their cheap drinks, though I didn't get to try it for myself. . . Oh yeah, they have zipline as well.. . This place is not as extravagant as the strip but it's worth visiting once for a change of scenery.
If you are looking for a classy, swanky Las Vegas experience. . . you are in the wrong place.  haha.. . Fremont Street is so amazing.  There are so many weird shenanigans going on there and rough looking people.  They always have live concerts going on and events.  The ziplines I have yet to try, but will soon.  The overhead screen is really something to behold.  The overhead screen itself is worth making the trip for.  . . I go to Chinese New Year every year on Fremont Street and they have the most amazing overhead projection and music.  Its beautiful.  The street performers are super weird but are so interesting and I should note that if they make you stop and look, you owe them a dollar.. . There is a lot of re-vamping going on down there these days, but what I like most about it is the old Las Vegas feel.  I know this sounds weird, but being in the older casinos is kind of kick because you feel like you are back in time.  I love the nostalgia of it all.. . While you are down there you should definitely take a minute to check out the fish aquarium in the Golden Nugget.  It has a waterslide from the pool that goes right through it.. . I also recommend the italian restaurant right next to the aquarium.  I have eaten there several times and the food is good.
Every trip to Las Vegas should include a night down on Fremont Street.  I've been going to Las Vegas for many years and the regular strip gets a tad boring night after night and this changes things up a bit!  . . I wish I spent more time here last week while I was out there because the place has a ton of energy, cheaper drinks, entertainment, ziplining, etc.  Not to mention the gambling - $5 blackjack tables, $5 roulette and some of the slot machines are old school with coins instead of the payout tickets.. . Save your souvenir shopping for this area - t-shirts are way cheaper, also things like shot glasses, key chains, etc.  This is also a place to really stock up on things like bottled water, drinks, and snacks for your hotel as they're cheaper here as well.  I like to just get a big can of beer from a convenient store and drink that as I walk this area but there are all kinds of drink and food deals in these hotels.. . One thing I should mention though is take a cab here...although nothing happened last year when we rented a car, I felt a little uneasy walking back to the parking garage,etc.  Once things start to die down around there at the end of the night, the freaks come out so to speak...Use common sense when wandering this area - the crowd is way different in these parts, not to mention the area outside Fremont not being the most safe.. . If you dare, head to the Fremont East area...it has a Hollywood Blvd feel to it...I grew up in Chicago so this type of scene isn't new to me, though it may be to some.
The Fremont Street Experience was so fun!!   You have to go at night though to get the full effect.   We enjoyed it more than the strip, it's old school Vegas.  They have several stages set up with live music and  a really cute Showgirl show called the Summer Hotties.  The Blackjacks were really good, 80s and 90s music.  Just lots of fun, felt very safe.  Yes there were some sketchy people, but they were few in numbers and we saw the same on the strip and in greater numbers.  I don't understand why anyone would bring kids to Vegas, you know going in what Vegas is famous for, so....  Parking is easy, we parked at the Four Queens, you can self validate inside for three free hours of parking,small charge after that.  Fremont is definitely worth a visit!
If you want to feel good about yourself, go here.. Suddenly, all your problems will be minuscule after seeing the ....humans...that hang around Fremont Street. . It's an experience all right.. A dirty, touristy, strip of sadness that has the constant aroma of marijuana lingering in the air. You'll probably see bums. You'll probably see boobs. A few guts hanging over light washed jeans, a guy dressed up as a blunt, some people passed out on the ground here and there, a meth head making out with a prostitute, etc etc. . I mean I guess it's totally great if you like watching the world go to shit right in front of your eyes.
compare to the glitz and glamour of the strip, fremont street just pales in comparison, its like this, if you're a tourist, you go play on the strip, if you're a local, you go play at fremont street. . there's naked fat male bunnies and sexy female cops who will cuff you up, oh also a male succbus devil lurking around in the day time.... . the golden nugget is here, probably the only place that has a decent arcade...omg, they have Initial D 3rd stage, two DDR machines....booo its supernova...now time to get your dance dance on while drifting on Iro. . they also have a mini-fair games...the ring toss is impossible, it's a lie!!! It's a body of lies
The Fremont Freak Show--trailer park/redneck entertainment at its finest.. . It's really sad that downtown has improved sooooo much with dining and bars but yet they still let the freaks and other bad elements in-every step someone asking you for money-every other step someone yelling at you because you won't give them money. Meth/crack heads ready to stab you at any moment.. Maybe most of the tourists enjoy it because they can't afford to go on the strip for real entertainment. I've personally gone to container park and the new restaurants/bars which are beyond fabulous-MTO cafe (but saw a drug bust happening outside while we were eating), eat, container park, The griffin, the cocktail room--------but I've had it with all those so called entertainers. I can't take it anymore .. Guess I will be hanging on the strip from now on if they can't clean up the rif raff. For Gods sake-someone tried to rob my Dad at fremont. Casino-where were the security???!!!!!!!!. Contain these people Fremont street experience-put all the 'entertainers' in one area or on the side streets. They're not making all your renovations look very appealing!!'!!!!!!!. Won't ever return until this problem is fixed--and I so dearly want to return to all the wonderful places that have opened. Such potential with what's there-but the potential will never be successful until you remove those people!!!!!. . One other mention-WHY do parents bringing their children to this insanity? WTH! Have you no moral sense or any regard for your child's welfare??!!
If you go to Vegas you must make this part of your destination! The light/music show in the middle of Fremont is soo cool! Cheap souvenirs!  Many food places and things to do. We hit the Mob museum and then made are way to Fremont! Don't pass this it up!
Free! You can't beat free! . . I can't believe any Yelper would rate this less than four-stars. Shame on you! What Yelper can say no to free? It's like a 24-hour Yelp Event on steroids! . . So, for the summer months, they have a line up of concerts called Rock of Vegas, which are 100%.... you guessed it... free! You can check the 2014 line up here. http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/positively-lv/Popular-summer-concert-series-kicks-off-this-weekend-on-Fremont-Street-259105181.html. . I went last Saturday, Karmin was playing. It was a nice set up, the outdoor stage was right next to Binion's, across from the Golden Nugget. I arrived 15 mins early and it wasn't crowded at all, I could've elbowed my way to the front if I wanted to. By the time they were 30 mins into their set, it started get crowded, and hot, and sweaty... so it does get packed. But not as bad as I thought, I still could see and hear them through the sea of fanny packs and camera phones. Added bonus, you can watch them on the electronic canopy, so you don't have to be in the stage area to see them, you can be walking around. . . Karmin? Big whoop, you say? Well, I'm not into blond, female rappers myself... but next week they have 3 Doors Down. OMG... reminds me of my angst-filled twenties, get my Zoloft ready. Then the week after they have Soul Asylum, Eve 6 and... Deep Purple. WTH? Did I mention it's free? It's not Britney, but hey, that's a pretty good lineup for a completely free event. . . Parking is a pain, what used to be free parking at Main Station is now $5 for the night. I don't think it's too bad, but I'm spoiled by Las Vegas and free parking. I'm sure if you look around, there's free parking somewhere. Whatever I lost in parking, I easily made up for in cheap booze, a vodka and cranberry cost me $4, a bottle of beer was $3. A very economical night, wouldn't you say? . . **Overall, I highly recommend Fremont Street, especially during their free summer concert series. And if concerts aren't your thing, you can be easily amused by all the colorful characters, cheap booze and gambling that abound.**
This place rocks my socks! Very chill, more classic real Vegas vibe. A lot of locals venture here. There's music, casinos, light show and more. Definitely a lively hang out. Get loose, grab some drinks and enjoy! Btw free parking at Queens Casino (;
"Mama, when I grow up I wanna be ratchet.". . This is old Vegas. Other than the light show and zipline, there isn't much to do here, unless you like dingy casinos, mediocre food, and street performers who stand around not doing a damn thing. . . I've seen butt cheeks before, and you Miss need to do squats.
