Great micro brewery and casino located on the streets behind the strip. The offer true pints of house brewed beer for $2. They even make their own root beer, which is my poison.  The beer and root beer both stay fizzy until the last drop. . . The place itself inside is sort of old and dingy looking, but that is part of the charm. I hear the restaurant is amazing. I prefer to eat at the Metro Pizza place inside, but the restaurant was packed full of people and I do believe there is a wait list for the ribs. . . This is a great place to come if you are looking for an experience away from the busy strip.
$5.99 steak and eggs from 11pm-11am!. . We came here on a Friday night, a group of 6, for some steak and eggs. I found this place on yelp and it had really high reviews so I had to come and try it for myself! We came here a little after 11pm, just in time when they start serving steak and eggs. We walked up to the restaurant and saw a lot of empty tables so we thought that it was a pretty slow night. However, when we went up to the host, she said rudely that the wait was about 30 minutes with another party of 6 ahead of us. We were all confused to why we have to wait so long because there was so many open tables. I thought maybe not enough servers? But still, 30 mins??. . So we waited and our pager finally buzzed. I was so happy and excited! As I followed the same host to our table, I said "the wait is actually not that bad!" but she pretended that I didn't exist and ignored me -__-. So I ordered the $5.99 steak and eggs, medium well. We didn't wait too long until we got our food and the first bite of the steak was delicious! I was so excited to get to the center where its the most juiciest! However, they over cooked my steak to the point it was so dry and it was so hard to eat, like a well done x2 steak T_T. I couldn't even enjoy it nor finish it so I gave the rest to my boyfriend since he wanted it. The steak was so overcooked that the next morning my boyfriend woke up with his jaw sore from chewing the steak LOL!! I laughed so hard that morning hahaha. My friends ordered medium rare and it came out looking like medium. So yeah, my experience wasn't that great however the potatoes and the egg was good and our server was amazing! He was so nice and friendly to us unlike the host. I'm willing to give this place another try but make sure I order medium rare.
Excellent casino and steak.. . Cab driver mentioned is on the way in from the airport when I asked about good, cheap eats. Decided to head over and wasn't disappointed. . . They have reasonable table limits so you can stretch your gambling money if you just want to play a little for a cheap price. It's not a big casino but they have all the major games covered. . . The real star of the show is the 8.99 steak special. For nine bucks you get a 10 oz steak, baked potato, salad, green beans, and a beer of your choice. I expected the steak to be a thin, cheap, grisly piece of meat. But it was actually a nice cut that was cooked perfectly. . . If you don't have a players card the price is 11.99 and it doesn't come with a beer. It's still a good deal at that price. Our server was nice enough to let us use an extra voucher that he had, and that made it even better.
Arrived in Vegas a little later due to plane delayed in S.F., CA after flying from JFK in NY. My brother and sister in-law wanted to rest in our condo at the Desert Club Resort. My wife and me wanted to get some good bar food and drinks and maybe decent music to listen to. We didn't want to go to a huge casino and deal with all that or get dressed up, or have to travel to far. Well we checked yelp, and Ellis island seemed to be worth a shot, since it was only about 1 mile from our resort/condo. We arrive and was skeptical before going inside. Looked questionable. However once we went inside and settled at bar. Things seemed to be OK. Casino is a little run down, but prices are cheap for food and drinks and food is pretty good. I had 3/ 22oz house  Belgian white drafts with an orange slice, several shots of lemon drops, a huge Quesadilla, and my wife had about 3 or 4 mixed drinks. We were ready to go and turned to each other to guess what our bill would be. I guessed $100 she said $80. Our bill came and it was only $48. We thought something was missing, as it is Vegas which=expensive usually. We left a $13 tip and left. This is a local no frills Casino/bar/karaoke/diner/pizza place that brews some of its own beer. Good place to go to for a cheap night out, or before you hit the strip at night and spend more money. Check it out give it a chance.
Great if you like diner food cheap.  They are always busy and ALWAYS have great specials.  Their steak meal special is amazing.  Always kinda a classic place to stop for breakfast in Las Vegas.  Located just behind the strip it makes it easy to get to! Had biscuits and gravy and it was ok.  Basic omelettes.
$5.99 late night steak and eggs. If you can't afford that you must have gambled too hard or fell in love with a stripper.. . We went around midnight and there was no wait to get seated. In fact there was almost nobody else there. It was a Sunday night though. The food came out at a reasonable time. I ordered medium rare for my steak and it came out exactly how I wanted it. And with a big bottle of A1 sauce by my side I could not have asked for a better dinner.
This place was great, the food excellent, the service excellent, portion size HUGE. We will definitely come back here while in Vegas. Forgot to take pictures we were so hungry.
This review is for the karaoke hosted in the lounge.. . "Jeremy, you're up. Jeremy, come to the stage. Jeremy? Going, going, gone!". . "Sarah, come to stage. It's your time to sing, Sarah. Sarah? Okay, who's next?". . "Fallon! Let's get Fallon up here ladies and gentlemen! No Fallon? Moving on.". . "Arthur, you ready bud?! Where's Arthur at? Arthur's not here?". . Okay, you get my point, this place is a disorganized mess when it comes to karaoke. For every five or six names called to sing on a Friday night, maaaaaybe one or two of them were actually there to sing. The same name would often get called within a few songs of each other and you have no idea any kind of time frame that you may actually get your turn to jump on stage. . . This could easily be remedied with a chalkboard or even a maintained signup sheet on a clipboard where past singer's name are checked off as they sing. Is the concept revolutionary? Heck no, but it works even at the crummiest karaoke bars that I've been to. Two hours and six cocktails later and I still didn't get a shot at stardom at Ellis Island. Three stars earned for an overall great crowd...
Excellent!  This spot reminds me of a dive bar back home.  Great bartenders, cheap food and drink, and a great air of locals.  Had the IPA which was awesome, definitely coming back to try some of the others.
wow....  What a nice surprise.. Good Service .... good Food ... GREAT PRICE.. 3.99 gets you two eggs ... breakfast potatoes ... and toast ..... The potatoes were so hot and crispy ...   I ate them all.   Thanks.
So this is a complete and total dive.  The whole operation from the casino to the restaurant(s).  And it's WONDERFUL.  The Prime rib was great, but my husband had a hamburger that apparently had bacon ground into it - it was unbelievable.  It's super cheap, and I think that 4 adults and 2 kids ate (and drank) for about $120 total.
I only come here to eat at the cafe. I have eaten here a bunch of times and there is not one bad thing I can say about this place. Great place where all the locals go. The quantity and quality of food you get is great and it's very affordable. I have had the fish & chips, the philly dip, the steak, fried shrimp dinner, and I dont even know what else and it's all been beyond my expectations and the service is great. The craft beers are good too. I've eaten at the bbq place as well and while it was good too, I like the cafe better. The ribs I got were delicious but all the sides were awful. I just came here this past weekend (5/10) and in my drunken state, left my wallet here with all my money and credit cards and my ID!! What an idiot... luckily I remembered I came here and called them up the next day and sure enough they had it... THANK GOD!! All the cash was gone but whatever I was just happy they had it. THANK YOU ELLIS
Das Ellis Island ist in erster Linie eine Microbrewery, auf deutsch eine kleine Brauerei. Man kann vom Strip aus zu Fu hinlaufen. Die angebotenen Biere dort sind wirklich ausgezeichnet. Wer sagt die Amis konnen kein Bier brauen? Sie kennen zwar vielleicht das deutsche Reinheitsgebot nicht, aber schmecken tut es ausgezeichnet. Vor allem das Amber Ale hat es mir dort sehr angetan. Die angebotenen Biere haben wir an der recht coolen Bar getrunken, dahinter stand eine uberaus nette Barfrau.  . . Im Ellis Island gibt es auch ein Cafe - Restaurant. Ich habe auf die Karte geschaut, gunstig ist es allemal, gegessen hatte ich aber schon. . . Wie in Las Vegas fast uberall ublich gibt es im Ellis Island auch die Moglichkeit, zu zocken. Der Spielbereich ist aber nichts besonderes. In erster Linie sollte man also herkommen, wenn man Bier mag und sich in seinem Leben auch mal vorstellen kann, Bier zu trinken, welches nicht in Deutschland gebraut ist. Es lohnt sich.
$5.99 steak and eggs? Yup! This is the perfect spot to chow down after a night on the strip (or a long night at the tables). I don't recall seeing this special on the menu so you would need to mention it to your server and they'll happily take your order down.. . Don't expect great service as this is a no frills type of joint. For nearly the same price as a meal from a fast food joint, you cannot go wrong. Grab yourself a pint of their in-house brews to wash down all the grease from the food! From what I remember, they were only a couple dollars each.. . Cheers to a carnivore meal and decent brews!
My wife and I stay at Bally's when in Las Vegas. Ellis Island is on Koval Ln which is the next main N-S east of the strip, not a bad walk at all. This review is for the breakfast only as we only played slots briefly following breakfast. The omelets were large and cooked to perfection. The fried potatoes are excellent and you get lots of them. Wait service was friendly and very adequate. Do yourselves a favor, walk a short distance and get a great breakfast for 2 for a fraction of what you pay at a strip restaurant.
The steak was ok for the price. Yeah I could of paid $40 for a good steak at the strip. But when your in a budget this place is not that bad.
AMAZING!!!!!!! I come here every time I'm in Vegas. This place is the bomb! You can get an entire meal, including steak, potatoes, salad, and a beer for $7! You just tell them you want the steak special. I've been coming here for years ever since my family and I discovered it about 8 years ago. . . They are open 24/7 so you can get dinner anytime you want, which is perfect for Vegas. If there's a wait for your table there's a bar inside the casino where you can sing karaoke. And you can also gamble to kill time. They have slots, black jack, craps, you name it.. . It's such a little dive but it's great. I can rave about Ellis Island all day. I tell all my friends about it and they love it too! A true hidden gem in Vegas. :)
Quick tip: Way too far to walk from central strip. Make sure to take a cab.. . We came sober (mistake!) and went for the 8.99 steak + beer. Mehhhhh. I could barely stomach the steak, which had absolutely no flavor, but the mashed potatoes and gravy were pretty good. I probably would not come back unless I was lit.
The casino, is old and run down. We decided to head over here for some late night karaoke.. When we arrived it was a bit different from what I'm use to. The karaoke part was great! People singing great songs and dancing their booties off but the hotel was old and very run down. On the brighter note, the food was great and the prices were very cheap. If you're visiting Las Vegas and you're on a budget, I'd stay here for 2 reasons.. 1 being the food and the cost of the hotel and 2 being the after hours karaoke joint.
Ellis Island is great for a good meal at a great value.  It is worth wandering off "the Strip" to find this place.
Great place to eat with family if you want some steak and prime ribs !! Very good food would be great if they had asperges .. . Service was good , prime ribs come with free beer and soup for $13.99 cheapest and best tasting prime ribs I had and beer was great also !!. . We ate 6 people and it was only $60 buck$$!
This is a very casual place...a hidden gem if you will. Ellis island is a brewery too so you will have very cheap beer prices for very good beer!! The BBQ food here is simply 100% super delicious! The casino may not be pretty and the clientele may make you think twice about coming but hands down this place serves some quality grub!! Oh and if you get hammered enough they have Karaoke too!. . I'm not too positive about the Super 8 motel attached to it though.......I get the Bates Motelvibe
My family and I were having a reunion in LV. A former cabbie in LV told me how great this place was. He was right on the money. Great food, beer and service just one block off the strip.GO!!
I'm a prime rib fan and was in search for some good prime rib on my vacation.. I ordered medium rare prime rib and my husband ordered medium steak. My prime rib is tender but a little over done. It is more like medium well. The prime rib meal came with a big glass of beer which which was good and refreshing. My husband's steak is not so good. It came out well done and he didn't finish it. Maybe it's just a bad day in the kitchen.
