Food was outstanding and so were the sides.  Had the bone-in NY Strip.  Service was ok as our waiter didn't really make us feel welcome.
I really wanted to love this place, but honestly...well.... For starters, I was a single, attractive woman, dining alone when there was a giant computer convention at the Venetian. Why oh why would you seat me in a dark, partitioned corner??. Then my dirty martini came, and it was...warm. . And my iceberg wedge salad was tasty, but soggy. . My bone-in ribeye was enormous and glorious, but not exactly warm. . And my tawny port looked awfully ruby. . All in all my experience was uninspired.
Great steak. . Good service and atmosphere and accomodated our large group.
There's a reason why Emeril Lagasse is such a celebrated chef. His restaurant, Delmonico Steakhouse, provided impeccable service and outstanding food.. . Delmonico Steakhouse was our big dinner out in Vegas for a bachelorette weekend. 9 of us were promptly seated for our 7:30pm Sunday reservation. I ordered a glass of malbec (my favorite, which is rather had to find).. . As a table, we shared the BBQ shrimp (which was just the right hit of smokey and sweet), Truffle and Parm Potato Chips (uberly addictive) and the lettuce wedge salad.. . For my entree, I decided to get the Bone In Ribeye-the house specialty. It did not disappoint. It was quite a large piece of steak, but it didn't stop me from finishing all of it (that's not something I do very often). We split the creamed spinach and the creamed corn gratinee. The spinach was average but the creamed corn was vegetable candy. . . We ended our meal with Emeril's infamous Banana Cream Pie. Holy moly. Sky high pie packed with bananas, caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. Even though we were all full, we couldn't help but finish it.. . Our waiter was extremely attentive. Service, overall, was phenomenal. When our steaks were ready, there was a server for each plate so we were presented our dishes at the same exact moment. Now that's service.. . It goes without saying that this was pricey, even for Vegas standards, but you get what you pay for. . . I highly recommend checking out Delmonico at least once.
Wide whiskey selection, excellent bartenders. I'm assuming the food was good, but even though I came four days in a row I never made it past the bar.

I ate here years ago.  I had a nice meal but I don't remember much.  I went back last week with my husband and another couple. The steak was wonderfully done.  It has a wonderful feel inside the restaurant - big and airy.  We had the tuna and salmon tartar to start then shared the bone-in ribeye.  It really was good.  I'd go back in a second.
BAM! Sorry for the cliche, but Emeril hit the nail right on the head with this one. . . BAMtastic service, BAMtastic food, BAMtastic atmosphere and a guaranteed BAMtastic experience!. . Been there many times and I'll be BAMmed if everything hasn't exceeded expectations!. . Normally I would include tips for what to order and why. This time I have just one recommendation. Eat here. This is by far the best dining option between the Venetian and Palazzo. Now BAMit, make your reservation, enjoy and you're welcome! Lol!
Two words, food and service.  The service is top notch.  The food came timely, and everyone made sure my dining experience was exceptional.  The food, excellent without a doubt.  I had the fillet and it was very good.  Without a doubt I will definitely eat here again whenever in Las Vegas.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.   I finished with the banana cream pie, it was a very large piece of pie.
I had the bone-in rib-eye, which is the best steak I've had in my life. Deliciously juicy, tender, full of beef flavor, with just the right amount of bite, the thought of this steak is making me salivate while writing this review.. . My friend had his with the foie gras. If you like foie gras at all, DO THIS. It might seem a bit odd to pair these two together, but when I tried it, it set off little fireworks off my taste buds.
This was by far the worst meal I have ever had.  Not steak,   Meal!  I went with a group of 4, only 1 steak was cooked correctly and it was super fatty. I had a filet ordered medium to medium well black, it showed up well done with no char whatsoever.  My friend ordered hers blue and it showed up rare. My husband's was fine but like I said super fatty. The other friends was over cooked as well along with the snottiest looking disgusting foie gras I have ever seen. Bottom line_ you go to Vegas to have a great meal and it sucked.  All of it sucked. Go somewhere else for $100pp.
We have eaten here every time we are in vegas.Consistently top notch food drinks and desserts.Felt like a king and queen for 2 hours. Cannot say one bad thing about this place . Emeril has it down to a fine art! You will not be disappointed!
Service was great... !! We sat down to a late dinner to find the restaurant was extremely busy and still great service. Ordered the chateaubriand for two & was not disappointed. Nice sides were included - Asparagus & garlic mashed potatoes. Very generous portions. The popovers before the meal were perfect. Unfortunately we had no room left for desert. If you have not been to Delmonico ... Make it a stop on your next trip.
I don't usually go to fine dine restaurants while in vegas, but I make a few exceptions and this was one of them. Came here with a few buddies for a birthday. The waiter made our experience a very easy one. He offered many different suggestions and options. After we finally made our decision, the kind gentleman complimented us with bread and such. Afterwards, he poured our glasses with wine and afterwards treated the birthday girl to some lovely dessert. On to the food.... . At first I was on a budget, but then I said to myself, might as well splurge a little so i ordered the filet mignon and I have to admit, it was deeeeelicious. I did not order any sides with it, and wish i had ordered some sort of baked or mash potatoes. . . overall, i had a great experience and I would definitely refer someone to this place for great food and great service.
