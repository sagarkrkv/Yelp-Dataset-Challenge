Another spot to get fail safe good food, the use of fresh ingredients and creative ways of using them make for a great time every time. I just wish less people would know about it so it wouldn't get so crowded at times, I guess a blessing in disguise.
great service, great food
Great place and fun environment . Be advised wait times can be 30 mins given during busiest hours . Tuesday board of Bruschetta and bottle of wine for 20$ totally worth it. Valet parking recommended , no major parking lot and can full quickly. Most of the time is loud inside .
Mandatory valet parking. Stuffy atmosphere. Mediocre bruschetta (especially for the price). The wine our waitress suggested was the only redeeming part of our experience. If you're in the area, try Ingo's instead.
Bruschetta and Panini sandwiches
My favorite of all the Postino locations. The service is always top-notch and the patio makes it possible to believe you're not in the desert. My only suggestion for improvement: make that amazing Roasted Red Pepper Gouda soup a daily offering. Truly the best soup ever.
I am such a fan of this place. Husband  (who is more fried food and french fries sort of guy ) took me as a surprise for a date night. WHOLY AWESOMENESS.  Great GREAT brushetta (Even the husband liked it) and a great wine menu. I think I ordered everything that was remotely vegetarian. DELICIOUS. Seriously. I hear there is one in my neck of the woods (Ahwatukee).. can't wait to visit.
Beautiful food and beautiful people at a great price.  Can't beat that.  $5 pitchers at happy hour.  I had the chicken & mozzarella panini.  It was delicious.
Really enjoyed this quaint little wine bar. Ambiance and decor were great, however it was dark so difficult to read the menu. The Waitress helped me pick out a good glass of red wine, although she liked more rose wines. The bruschetta was AMAZING!!! We tried a variety of the bruschetta: apple & bri, artichoke and prosciutto. Can't wait to go back!
This restaurant occupies an old post office on a quaint corner in a residential neighborhood. The menu is simple, mostly bruscettas and salads. I prefer going before 6pm when wine is $5. a glass. During the nice weather the door opens out to the patio and you can even bring your dog. The waitstaff are all friendly and there is no bad table. Don't walk, run!
Absolutely love this place. Great atmosphere. Nice wine selection too. The servers are very friendly and helpful with recommendations. Plus, their bruschetta is delish!
This is the original Postino, named because the building actually used to be an old post office.  I've actually been to all 3 locations now many times, and they're all great, and all have a huge wait Friday and Saturday night so be prepared for that.  The food is fantastic, the pub board, bruschetta, and paninis are all great.  Drinks are good as well, I'm just not a huge wine drinker.  If you want it to not be completely packed come in on a week night or in the afternoon.
Great food and atmosphere.  I suggest the "take two" lunch option.  I had the chicken salad with raspberry vinaigrette and roastbeef panini.  Both were great.  Service was friendly!
The best local wine pub if you're in the Arcadia/Biltmore area - seriously. Great paninis and bruschetta and of course ! don't forget the Red Wine ! yum try the Mozzerella and Chicken sandwich or the roasted red pepper w/ goat cheese on bread :)
Delicious going away dinner with my bf at postinos outdoor dining area. Besides the misters going crazy, our food was delicious! We ordered bruschetta - fig mascarpone with pistachios, prosciutto, salami, and pesto. All were delish! We also ordered the butchers block that came with asparagus, hummus, two cheeses, prosciutto, salami, almonds, candied cherries and more. I would go back for more!
Every time I go here, I really do just love it.  They do a great, consistent job. It is safe to bring clients or just have some fun with friends and family.
$5 happy hour? Craaaaazzzzzy. We had some amazing wine, and a pitcher (2 pints) of beer. Seriously, this place is great for casual, relaxing drinking. Also, the servers were really nice and welcoming. I really enjoyed this restaurant. Especially the complimentary valet.
My neighborhood spot! Great happy hour, service and vibe any day of the week. :)
I love Postinos.  Especially Monday and Tuesday nights when they have their $20 deal for a bottle of wine and bruschetta.  The tomato jam bruschetta is my favorite.  It's like eating dessert.  The only negative is the parking.  You have to valet your car.  However they do have a secret parking lot up the road that is just a short walk.  It's a little north of Cambpell on the west side of 40th street.
