Went there a year ago - you will have to wait - if you like spicy this is the place for you - you can tell them 1 to 10 - my wife had 6 and could've gone higher - I had 5 and that was plenty spicy.  You will have to go at odd times to avoid a wait - we had to wait about 30 minutes.  If you have a large party (more than 4) will have to split party and may not get to eat all at the same time.
Tried Bouillabaisse for the first time at Oyster Bar this trip and it was amazing! It might be my go to dish from now on. . . Amazing oysters...so meaty and clean. We ended up making the trek twice! . . Tip: There's almost no wait when you go around 3pm. Any later and a line starts to form.
the place: set up is bar sitting. about 12-15 seats. only has 6 pots going at once. what that means is that there's gonna be some wait. I went there around 330am and waited about an hour or so in line and another hour until I actually took my first bite. is it worth the wait? sure why not? cuz I don't think your E going to get a dish like this anywhere else in Vegas. it was more of an experience for me than anything else, but the food was great too. . . the food: it's all about the combo pan roast. crazy tomato based soup with crab, lobster, and shrimp. it's goodness in a bowl. I highly recommend that to anyone that comes here. My friend had the gumbo.... It wasn't as good as the pan roast. I got it at level 10 spicy. it definitely had a kick and while it didn't drown out the flavor I needed a glass of water after every bite. next time I'm going to get it at around level 5. although I do lot eat oysters, people that had them said they were the best and freshest they've ever had. . . only downside is the wait because it can take a whole depending on your timing. there were people ahead of me that were waiting for 2 hours. overall I recommend this place.
Delicious oysters at 3am in the morning? Why, yes please!! This place is open 24 hours. After we arrived to Vegas, we were undoubtedly hungry after the long drive and decided to come here to satisfy our cravings.. . We ordered:. . 1. Fresh oysters on the half shell ($19.99/dozen): the oysters are huge! Since you sit at the bar, you can watch the chef shuck the shells and the oyster meat is very big! Pretty much well worth your money. The oysters tasted fresh and delicious as you slurped them up! (5/5). . 2. Palace Pan Roast ($23.99): fresh seafood sauteed with cream, brandy, and tomato. Our huge bowl came with shrimp, crab, chicken, and andouille sausage. It comes with a bowl of steamed rice. An extra bowl of steamed rice is additional $2.99. Overall, it is very delicious!! It is just as good as the House Pan Roast at Ritters Steam Kettle! (5/5). . The service is friendly and you can definitely tell that this place can get pretty busy! The whole bar was full of customers even at 3-4am in the morning! So that pretty much says A LOT! Will definitely come here again =)
Giving this place 5 stars because they prepare the meal in front of you and damn it smells good.  I ordered the cioppino and yes, the seafood is frozen and overcooked and the spice level is somewhat deceptive as 6 is flaming hot.. . My mother in law ordered the alaskan chowder and it's rich and creamy, it's an excellent choice.  My wife ordered the bouillabaisse with a 7 spice level and it's approaching can't taste the food realm.. . But.... you can't beat the price you pay and the experience.. . Big tip: you should go during off hours as the other reviews mentioned because it does get crowded.  It's open 24 hours and the best time to go is around 11AM.. . Another tip: they will accept Station Casinos players card points if you gamble there, including Red Rock and Green Valley Ranch.. . Highly recommended.
The first piece of advice about the Oyster Bar? Prepare for a wait nearly anytime you come.  (At around 3:30PM though, it wasn't as bad as what I heard around 2AM where my friend waited for 3 hours).  And when you arrive there, you'll see why.  It's a tiny little area with seating only for about 20 people around a literal bar.  . . Indeed it's open for 24 hours but don't let that fool you either.  The food here is good and everything has spunk/personality.  Some cool notices - the food is prepped right in front of you.  The 'cooks' have a lot of personality.  And it's a great area to people watch such as seeing the regulars come on by.  Finally, they have a lot of late night deals.  Heads-up.. . Drinks-wise, they have beer and wine available for around $5-$15 with a decent variety.  They also have oyster shooters in beer/tequila/vodka variants (3 for $10) and they taste delicious of course.  We had the tequila versions.  They also have raw oysters available as well as soups . . Along with this comes a number of entrees. They have a number of dishes like jambalaya and some pasta all based on southern dishes.  The real things to focus on, in my opinion is the pan roast and gumbo.  I personally got the palace pan roast which comes with meat and shrimp while my friend got the combo which is basically seafood.  Another friend got house gumbo which came with seafood.  (PS: There is a split charge so just either try to get your individual dish and share if you want to taste or if you really have to - split it.)  The pan roasts were absolutely terrific.  We had them at a spice level of 7 and 8 for both pan roasts and 8 was still doable for those used to spices.  I personally was a bigger fan of the combo as well with the seafood really shining through and having a great taste.  You can also ask for the rice in it to be on the side.  The gumbo wasn't too bad although I personally preferred the creamier pan roast more.  And in the end, the meal was about $70-80 which was a great price for 3 people and a number of drinks/appetizers/main courses.  . . The wait may not always be worth it; the location far off the strip and the small seating arrangement kind of 'eh' but the meal is one of the better ones in terms of price and taste in Vegas and at least worth one look-see.
This place is a MUST when in Vegas!! Their pan roast is BOMB!!! Be prepared for a long wait. There's limited seating in this wrap around bar. Although the line only had maybe 10-12 people ahead of us it took an hour and half for our group to be seated. I know they were renovating the last time we were in Vegas, so maybe that has changed! We've tried pan roast other places, but oyster bar in the palace station is hands down the best!!!
Good god this place needs more seats.  This place is one of those places that ANY item you get is gonna be a good choice.  Even the Cesar salad was good here (yes I got salad here).. . I would stick with the pan roasts and the gumbos here.  You can get the crab cocktails and oysters and such, but the big hitters are the soups.  Phenomenal.  I want to go back just to try the gumbo.  They have some noodle dishes I want to try as well.. . Damn the smoke in the hotel and that atrocious line.  But what can you do?
I would give this place 5 stars because the food is soooo amazing! But the wait is horrible, they need to expand this place. Just to eat the my pan roast we have to wait for up to 1-2 1/2 hours! But it is worth is the food is amazing, and the staff is also funny. FYI this place is 24HOURS! so if your ever out here in Vegas try this place out for breakfast or after a night of partying!
I'm an oyster eating fool. I don't know what took me so long to get over here, when Arvin T came up with the brilliant idea of stopping in after the Zarkana event, I think I was more excited for dinner than I was the show! . . We show up around 9pm on a Saturday night and there were only a few people ahead of us in line. With only 20 seats at the bar, you're left staring in envy at the people shoveling spoons of goodness in there mouths. You get excited when someone is handed there check, oh good, they're leaving, we are next! . . We are seated and are anxious to order, both of us were so hungry, we contemplated finishing the stew the guy next to us left (just kidding, well maybe) we are given a sourdough roll and some butter, oyster crackers and water. I need food, not fillers. . . We start out with a Caesar Salad (this was really, really good by the way) and an order of Fresh Lump Crab app. We were like scavengers trying to find the last pieces of meat on the plate, it was so good! We then had an order of oysters of the half shell, that night it happened to be Gold Band Oysters from Louisiana. They were enormous, and I wasn't a fan. They were served with cocktail sauce and a dollop of horseradish. I'm generally a lover of smaller oysters like Kusshi and Kumamoto or Fanny Bay, I'm not holding this against them, just wasn't a fan of the taste of these oysters. . . The finale....the Combo Pan Roast. Served with a side of rice, this was the table favorite. Chunks of crab meat and huge pieces of shrimp throughout the stew. The flavor was unreal. This has been haunting me for two days now. . . We were already planning our meal for when we return. I want to come back for the Bouillabaisse or the Cioppino. Arvin has his pick of the Gumbo. Hopefully they'll have some better oysters.
I was craving the oyster bar for quite a while now so I begged and begged my boyfriend to take me and finally we went. We got there around 7:30 pm but were seated around 9:15ish. There were I believe only 2 cooks who alternates and one server. I have so much respect for the server, she was hustlin hard! I got the combo pan roast and it was bomb! We got our food and fifteen minutes into eating our food, we just to-goed it and the next day when I warmed it up it taste just as good. Long wait but worth it.
The food here is great, but the overall experience/value isn't in line with the cost or the wait. . . I hadthe New England Clam Chowder and the Combo Pan Roast after waiting approximately 45 minutes. Both soups were hearty and full of flavor and sea food. . . Located in the heart of the Palace Station Casino, the Oyster Bar feels extremely out of place, adjacent to slot machines, the bingo counter and smoking tourists. Worst of all is the line situation--hungry people are basically staring at the diners eating at the bar. Seeing as there are only about 25 seats and the cooks stagger seating in such a way that you're likely to wait 45 minutes-3 hours to sit down. This means that before you eat, it's likely that you'll be intently watching those presently eating, urging them to  eat faster. And once you sit down, you know the people behind you are thinking the same thing about you. The entirety of the dining experience was enough to prevent me from returning, but the food was quite tasty.
My friend had been raving about this place like an insane person. I stopped believing in food hype a loooong time ago and when we got there and saw a 2hr wait AND that this is literally a bar that seats like 10 people; I was very over it. . . Fast-forward to the next day.... Just finished boozing and needed food before heading back to the hotel. Friends brought up Oyster Bar and I drunkenly agreed. . . Guess what? 5 seats open. We ran there. I probably trampled an infant or two. Who cares, ive never ate here but have read the reviews and had friends tell me that there was no such thing as 'no wait'. . . Oysters: fresh and delicious. . Combo Roast: lots of flaky crab meat and shrimp.... The flavors were fantastic. Loved it. The thought of this dish enters my mind a couple times a day lol. . I can't wait to go back and try the Alaskan Chowder and Bouillabaisse along with a couple dozen oyster. . . Seriously highly recommended!!!
Reading the reviews one would think this is the best place to eat in Vegas. It's not. In fact I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. The wait is long no matter the the time. The food was good but not great or excellent. Also, we must of gotten the "chef" on a bad day as he was a little surly and condescending. The rest of the staff wasn't much better. Your time and money is better spent elsewhere.
I've heard about this place for the longest time but I've always been intimidated by the notorious long lines and opted for the comfort of seafood buffets. During my latest trip to Vegas with friends, we decided to brave it out. We went at 4pm (random time to eat but we had a late start with our day) and we were pleasantly surprised to have a 15 min wait. Unbelievable! The food was delicious - I tried the pan roast but every bite was so flavorful. . . Bottom line - avoid crazy lines by going at random times to enjoy a delicious meal! . . Oyster Bar- I will come back for you! :)
Lack of seating and no reservations. Death sentence or so you would think!  The wait is worth it. Not in the best location in Vegas but really some of the best food I have eaten in the 20 Years I've lived here. . . Ive been here in total 15 times. Cant really say this any better than to say it worth the wait but make sure to prepare that you will be waiting awhile.
I love this place.  The food is amazing and the staff makes the experience all that more wonderful!  I don't even mind the wait, with the right friends the time flies by.  I love to indulge in the specially created Lava Sauce, although some are better than others.  But I am impressed with the love and creativity each of the chefs put into their dishes.. . I have introduced many of my friends to the Oyster Bar and will always continue to do so.  This is the best Oyster Bar.. . Make it a point to go!
Not worth the wait.  Took 1.5 hours to get our food and they still managed to forget the clam chowder.  The cook was just complaining the whole time about working a 10 hour shift.  Everyone has worked a 10 hour shift before, but the customers don't need the attitude.  Lousy food, lousy service, lousy casino.
Great oysters. The beers went great with the chowders and gumbo. The ambience is a zero but the food is good.
This place never fails!!!. Best hole in the wall spot in Vegas!  . . Combo Seafood PanRoast Level 10 spicy! I've tried Level 20, which was firing hot, but was abit too much for my taste buds.  Stick tolevel 10 and you will love it!. . Best time to go is 3am to 8am.  Worst time to go is 5pm-10pm and expect long waits as the place seats only 12-16ppl.
If five stars means "as good as it gets," then this is as good as it's gonna get. Yeah, it's a long wait sometimes, but it's worth it. I know, I know, you're at the Palace Station, but you'll be ok. You won't get seafood poisoning. Your friends aren't playing a trick on you.. . The pan roast is perfect and fills the empty hole in your heart. How can you not be happy eating this? Seafood in a tomato-y bisque. It's like standing in the sun after you've been in a too-cold room for hours. You just soak it up, forgetting all of your discontents.
