Came here for a 40th birthday celebration and it was great! Atmosphere was upscale but still upbeat, staff super friendly, and food was excellent.  Ribeye, crab cakes...all the way down to the side dishes.  And the VIP beverage was off the hook.
MOST AMAZING STEAKHOUSE EVER!. . Yup, it's true! Del Frisco's is an amazing steakhouse!! They're located off the strip, but it's only about a five minute drive by taxi and is well worth the trip and the money spent to get to this restaurant.  . . Our party of eight was seated in what seemed like our own private room. We were tucked away in the corner and we couldn't even hear the people at the table closest to us. Score!!. . Service here is spot on. Our server was very friendly and helpful. She recommended certain foods and was attentive to our needs and wants for our meal, both food and drink. The staff who brought out our food and the bartenders were also amazing as well. I love how they worked as a team to make sure that all the people in our party were taken care of and got what they needed. . . I ordered the Filet Mignon. It was PERFECT. So good!! I'd highly recommend this steak. As a table, we ordered some sides as well. I tried the Lobster Mac N Cheese (AMAZING!!) and the Mushrooms (so GOOD). The rest of my table seemed to love their meals as well. . . For drinks, we all got a shot of Fireball Whiskey (strong, but good). I got a Margaritini, which is a combination of a Martini and a Margarita. Sounds weird, but it works and I really enjoyed it. As a table, we also ordered a couple bottles of wine. Apparently they weren't very good. But, I had a few drinks in me by the time I got to the wine, so it seemed fine to me. . . For a party of eight, the total came to close to $900 with tax and tip. The restaurant did comp the two bottles of wine for us since they weren't very good. If the wine was added, it would have been a little over a grand. Not too bad considering all the food and alcohol we ordered for the amount of people at our table. . . Come try Del Frisco's next time you're in Vegas. It won't disappoint. . . Cheers!
My cousin and I only had one nice dinner in Vegas during our short stay and decided to ball out. Since she's a steak girl this was our choice, especially after my bf raved about the one in NYC.. . I made the reservations on Open Table for a Monday evening with no issues. The hostess was friendly and welcoming. We were seated and our waiter welcomed us and handed us the menus. My bf had given me a heads up that they offered a Filet Mignon trio that I wouldn't find on the menu so I had my mind set on this already even prior to seeing the menu (which I had already reviewed online prior to our dinner). My cousin got the same thing. The Filet's came our perfectly cooked. They were topped with 1) Broiled Shrimp 2) Brie 3) Crab, Asparagus, Bernaise. They were delicious but got me full all too quick. We also got the Spinach Supreme and Potatoes Au Gratin for our side dishes also. This was wayy more than enough food for 2 females. As if we hadn't already ordered too much, we decided to finish our gluttonous meal off with a Banana Bread Pudding w/ Caramel which we decided to share. Our hungry stomachs definitely got the best of us and we brought the left-overs back to our hotel which my cousin ate the next day. . . Del Frisco's was a really nice restaurant. They also had someone playing the Piano for most of the evening. Service was great and food was good. I'd definitely recommend this steakhouse.
This place is great for a special night out with your special someone. My honey brought me here for a special date night. Kind of dressy, but evening casual can be appropriate attire. They have a full bar for whatever you would like to drink. . We had the shrimp cocktail for an appetizer very huge jumbo  shrimp and yummy.. The Filet Mignon is so tender you can cut it with your fork and special sauce on the side for your dipping. But the steak was done so perfectly done it tasted so delicious,  ono, excellente,  fabulously incredible. . I also had a Mai Tai drink that was like I was back in Hawaii. I had made them make it the way I wanted with the dark rum and the right amount of pineapple juice. I like the layered way and mix it when your ready to drink.. I would recommend place to all my friends if they wanted a place to go for that special occasion or for a special evening out with your special someone. . Make your reservations if you decide to go here.. The service is superb and the attention they will give you. Of course the tipping 20% is appropriate for this place as they will not ignore you.
Was recommended by a coworker to this restaurant. First impression was very good. The place looked clean somewhat old fashioned. The food was good the steak was very tender. The thing that really stood out was the service. All the staff was friendly. We were there to celebrate my girls birthday so the entire staff signed a card wishing her a great birthday which was a nice detail. Our server Heather is who deserved the 5 stars she was very attentive and funny. She recommended a few things to enhance our meal which were right on! I Would defiantly recommend this place to anyone and look forward to going back when we are in town.
Really nice staff.  Everyone was making sure our food was perfect.. Excellent steak and potatoes.  Just what we were looking for.
Excellent Food. Excellent Service. Zero Complaints. The Tomahawk Ribeye Steak is fabulous. Expensive but well worth it.
Best steak I've had, hands down. Better than Mastros, Wolfgangs, Cut, you name it. The only one I can't compare is Peter Lugers. . . As for the steak, it had a perfect crust! Just the right amount seasoning. I had a 24oz American Wagyu Bone in Tomohawk.. . Don't miss the crab cakes, spinach and lobster Mac. Trust me!
I got the petite filet mignon medium rare on the cool side and it was amazing! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The mashed potatoes had skin included which I'm not a big fan of- but it was tasty. The bleu cheese wedge salad was delicious. The cheese chunks were not too sour like with some bleu cheese and the strawberry cheese cake was on the fluffy side and not as dense as some places.
Went for my wife's birthday, loved the service we got and also they wrote my wife a birthday card!!! Awesome steak house with awesome service! We ordered Lobster Mac-5 star! Crab Cake-4 star! Spinach Supreme- 5 star!, Filet Mignon-5 star!, Porterhouse-5 star!
After reading all the good reviews on Yelp, my wife and I decided to try Del Frisco's one night. I will say that it was one of the most interesting dinners that we have ever experienced!. . We arrived a little early for our reservation but they seated us immediately. Our first impression was that the restaurant was very loud, but I think we were walking into the bar area because they seated us in a smaller room with 6 or 7 other tables and a large group on the back wall. The room should have been quiet but that is where the real excitement began!. . We sat down and ordered a drink, only to realize that the large group sitting just a few tables away already ordered their drink (and them some). I knew they had been drinking for days on end because they began to sing songs, clap, yell, laugh, etc. like they were celebrating a thousand birthdays! This went on untilthe hostess attempted to seat another table right next to them. After 5 mins the table requested they be moved and were met with mocking cheers from the group. Another 5 mins went by and 2 other couples walked in and immediately requested a table in a different area because of the antics taking place. After each couple left, the group became more belligerent and entertaining.  At that point, we couldn't resist watching this all go down - even though it was interrupting what was supposed to be a quiet, romantic dinner for two. . . After a few more minutes, the manager approached their table and requested that they show some courtesy and quiet down. Of course, the manager was met with complaints and mocking responses; that's when things really got good! If that were my restaurant, I would have grabbed them off their chairs and kicked them out the door at that point! The manager came to our table and asked us if we would like to be moved. We declined the offer because we were already eating our appetizer and enjoying the show. Finally, after another couple walked in and left, the manager asked the group to leave the restaurant. At that point their anger boiled over and they began to argue and refuse to pay their bill. They also approached our table and asked us if they were being rude. Of course, we told them exactly what we thought of their actions that evening. After a few more complaints and insults, they finally left the restaurant!. . Back to our dinner: We both ordered the Caesar salad and filet. The salad was great and the steak was one of the best in Vegas! The service was exceptional and the manager should be applauded for the way she handled everything. I have never seen anyone kicked out of an upscale restaurant but they definitely deserved it - and then some! They even comped our appetizer and desert; which was completely unnecessary!. . We will definitely add Del Frisco's to our favorite list and we won't forget to order the chocolate cake for dessert!
I am such a fan of this happy hour that I am almost reluctant to leave a review. It is hard enough to find a seat at the bar. If you are not there by 5:00 you will be waiting. An excellent menu at any time, the HH discounts make it especially good. And they offer a good Pinot by the glass, so you can properly compliment your entree. I should also mention that there is a piano player. Live entertainment is always a bonus.
Made reservations on Open Table for a party of 4 on MDW 2014 (Sunday). Upon arrival, we were seated right away. Like a fine dining restaurant and a like a professional, our waiter greeted us right away, introduced himself and the menu. Benjamin, our waiter, had a fantastic attitude, very welcoming and made our experience personable. I guess on Sundays,  they offer a prix fix menu, which was the perfect portion. I had an 8 oz filet mignon, medium rare plus (cooked to perfection), with a Del salad, avocado dressing on the side, and their signature crab cake as my chosen side, all for $47? They allow different choice of steak with a small additional fee. Mentally, the 8 oz seemed like a tiny, small cut, but like I mentioned it was the perfection portion. We ordered additional sides that can feed the 4 of us with leftovers: lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach, mushrooms and asparagus.  The lover had a huge 22 oz bone - in ribeye, medium rare. He killed it, nothing left on that bone. The other couple ordered prix fix menu but upgrade to ribeye. Another great fact, is everyone's food served at the same time. Great customer service. This is by far my favorite steak restaurant. Better than Mastros, Ruth Chris, Houstons, 5A5(this one in SF), Flemings Beverly Hlls, and STK. Also, forgot to mention, complimentary cakes (freshly made lemon cake and cheesecake) celebrating Anniversaries.
I have eaten at Del Friscos at least three times, due to friends birthday dinners and have never had a good experience. The service is always slow the food is never cooked right. I ordered the bone in filet this very last time and it was extremely fatty definitely not a good cut. We were even told our cab was outside waiting for us towards the end of dinner and in fact it was not. This place really needs to get it together and I do not understand the excellent reviews this restaurant gets. the only thing we enjoyed here was the lemon cake. . . To be honest this restaurant is at the same level as Outback Steakhouse. The only plus is that the noise level wasn't too loud so you can actually conduct a little business during dinner. With so many options in Las Vegas I will never return to the steak house no matter which occasion it may be.
This place was delicious.  I had a bone in rib eye or something forgot the name that was on the menu.  There special potatoes which are cheesy and gooey.  Asparagus and something else.  Crab cake was bomb.  The oysters were good and fresh and the king crab legs were awesome.  I love the service here, everyone was friendly and fun and playful when engaged.  For Dessert I had the Mousse I believe it was, maybe I'll upload pictures.  It was TDF.  My friend got the lemon cake to take home for his bday wish I would have tasted that.   Supposed to be really good.  The lounge singer was a little cheesy but overall great place. Sorry for lack of details but I waited two weeks to write this.
Best steak out there.  We ordered the double eagle 26 oz bone in cut along with the stone crab claws.  Steak was cooked the way we liked it, and as we requested.  Medium with a pink inside...not bloody.  Perfection in taste with the right char on the outside and flavors bursting from everywhere.  Hands down, this is the place to get steak.  We just caught the end of stone crab season.  Lots of meat in those claws and we ordered the large, not the jumbo.  Lemon cake was absolutely amazing and moist.  I wasn't much of a fan of the lemon cake but after that, I most definitely am.. . What made our dining experience cool was the amazing service Brian gave us, as well as the manager, Amanda, stopping by to greet and chat. Amanda and Brian were warm and friendly, as well as professional.  The staff and food make the place what it is.  We were there to celebrate our anniversary as well as babymoon, and they made it special for us.. . There are locals hanging out at the bar and enjoying happy hour.  Somehow, the place doesn't seem as stuffy, but do go in there dressed somewhat decently .   This is now my wife's and my top place to get steak.
One of the best steak houses in Las Vegas!  It is up there with SW.  Excellent service by all staff.  Especially loved the VIP cocktail!  YUMMY!  I'd go back just for that.  The steak was of course great, but the lemon cake was moist and delicious.  Will be back again!
