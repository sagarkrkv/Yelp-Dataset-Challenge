I cannot write enough positive comments for this place! We have been here countless times! The food is fantastic and the atmosphere is fun and unique! LOVE LOVE LOVE!
Food was pretty good, but the service was terrible! 45 minutes in line just for a couple of (pretty tasty) burgers and fries. There was a line out the door at 11 on a saturday morning, and they only had one window open. You could see from the line that the cooks were often standing and doing nothing because they were only taking one order at a time. Overall, 2 stars for the service, 4 stars for the food.
Excellent breakfast and a fun place to go with kids! We have only ever had breakfast here, and on their breakfast menu the waffles amazing! The breakfast tacos and scramble bowls are excellent too.
Great food and even better desserts. Prices are reasonable and food portions are the perfect size. They find the seats for you so no need to worry about the long lines.
Great food..Good place for the family..My kids really like it..
I went today for lunch. First time and the experience was very comfortable. I had their 6oz burger with cheese grilled onions bacon and avocado. The bun was warm and toasty.  Big portion with fresh veggies. Delicious. The side of fries were a light and crispy.  Atmosphere was very welcoming. We sat outside on a great day with plenty of shaded areas. The only thing I can criticize would be we had to shoo flies away from us constantly. Easy fix though because you can just eat inside. Definitely going back.
Great food, great atmosphere! Very kid friendly, we bring out family here all the time.
We had a tour here and the manager Clayton was awesome! The food was great and the customer service was excellent. I had the pork tenderloin sandwich.
I had the BBQ chicken salad here. I know what. You're thinking, right, "oh it's just a salad, nothing to get excited about". Well strap in because it was exciting, and delicious! Their veggies are so fresh (I liked the sweet corn in there) and the chicken was nice and tender, with their BBQ sauce which was also really good. My husband got the BBQ chicken pizza that Guy ate when he visited and really enjoyed it as well. It was also nice to sit outside and eat there, it felt like we were back home in Wisconsin instead of sitting in the middle of the desert! We would definitely return.
Amazing food very farm fresh just make sure you are prepared to wait in line if you go during prime time on the weekends. I have never had a bad meal!
I found out about this place watching diners, drive ins, and dives and when I moved out here my wife and I had to try it. We got the Fontina Cheese Burger which was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The pesto chicken sandwich was delicious if you love pesto. The onion rings were the best I've ever had. You must go if you live in the area. You won't be disappointed.
I normally come for the Coffee Shop's cupcakes, but today Joe's was the stop. . . I ordered the Sonoran Dog and and Carolina dog. Both were excellent. The pulled pork on the Carolina dog was perfect texture and the BBQ sauce was very good. . . The onion rings were soooo good. Dill seemed like an odd seasoning but tasted awesome. They stayed hot crunchy and you could tell they were cooked in fresh oil.
Some people must not get out much. . . Don't get me wrong, good was good. Enjoyed the fresh ingredients. . . The line. Why have 2 windows, but have one closed at dinner time on a weekend? That's ridiculous. . . Is it good?...yes. . . Is it amazing?....no. . Is it worth standing in line for.....eh. . Everything seemed to lack flavor. It was good, but expected a little more spices and flavor. Healthy food doesn't have to be bland. I shouldn't have to dunk my sandwich in ketchup to add some flavor.
The atmosphere alone is worth the visit.  It's a picnic hotspot, only they take care of all the food!  Oh and the food is incredible!
We were really excited to try this place after hearing so much about it online and TV. I got the ahi tuna sandwich with onion rings and my fiance got a burger with fries. The food overall was very good. You could tell that the veggies were fresh and the portions were decent. However the place was a little pricey for what it was. $2.50 upcharge to get onion rings instead of fries with my meal? Not worth it. Especially since you get about 5 rings..  And yes, they're good. But like the rest of the food, It didn't blow me away. It was well made American food. That's it. I wouldn't go in expecting the best food you've ever eaten. . . I do want to say, the place itself is really cool. Its clean, has great service, and a cute retro look. Plus the restaurant is right on the farm which is a nice walk after a big meal. They also have a coffee shop next door and a farmers market every Wednesday. We'd definitely go back, but id probably try something different, Like one of their fresh salads.
I went here for my birthday after hearing about it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and it is very delicious. I love the food here, especially the Southwest burger and grilled pizzas. Not to mention the atmosphere is family-friendly and carries a good vibe. I plan on returning there again for my next birthday lunch!
Joe's has good food but the price is a little steep for what you get considering there is no wait staff. You stand in line to order your food and then have the option to sit inside or out. If the weather is nice, I recommend sitting outside. The food was pretty good. I had a burger but like I said, a bit overpriced for what it is.
I am SO in love with the banana split sandwich!! Great food. Great service. Indoor and outdoor seating.
We ate here with our two kids a few days ago.  My wife had been here before, but I had not.  I loved the food.  I had the BBQ bacon burger, my wife had a simple grilled cheese, and my oldest son had corn dog bites.  We all loved our food.  The food wasn't the best I've ever eaten, but I liked that the restaurant was different than your normal restaurant.    Really enjoyed ourselves.  Will be back.
Excellent selection,. One of the best bbq chicken pizzas I've ever tasted, . Delicious fried green beans,. Very friendly bunch of kids they have working there... They just have to do something about the flies. There were hundreds of them.. They'll eat your food if you're not careful. . My grandma almost went Super Saiyan on the dang things!. Don't take a date or your grandma here, get takeout instead. They have a picture of Guy Fieri on the wall and even he's swattin them flies away.
