This was a great show to watch. Excellent water and aerobic performance! I would highly recommend anybody to come and watch this. The stage is huge!. . I will have to go and watch Ka next and see how that one plays out.
I know I might be crucified for this, but I really do not see why so many people give this show a 5 star review. Yes it has some nice acrobats, and yes the music is great, but the reality is, to me, to stands very short of other Cirque shows and some of the few non Cirque shows on the strip. .  . First off this is one of the most expensive shows and it always seems to sell out, or almost at least. So you'd expect it to be the best of them all. So there is a man on fire. So there are two clowns who take up twenty minutes of the show (in between sets, I assuming so the actors and change). And honestly that is all that I can think of that was amusing. Perhaps I have seen too many of these shows and expect too much.. . For a water show they really only used the pool as a set, to make ascetically pleasing, but other than that they fell very short on  the action and usage of the water. The whole show, to me, was full of dancing and a few actions that were cool, but mostly just the standard show of strength and what not. The boat scene, however, was the best part of the show, hands down, and if they had incorporated that throughout the show, then I would be able to see the hype. . . But I don't, and so I will say that the 'Other' water show on the strip is much better.
Indescribably speechless,  exhilarating,  fabulous, spectacular,  out of this world....and ....  Needless to say,  I've been watching acrobatic shows since I was a kid and never watch a show like "O"  where combined with acrobatic, humor, and live music which turned in to an unbelievable show close to what I call "Perfection".
I don't know how people can give this a bad review unless you don't know what you're going to see.  Maybe cirque du solleil isn't you thing; then go see a comedy show because you are wasting a seat.  The performers are amazing.  Yes the story line is weird and hard to follow but you aren't there for the story.  My wife was upset that I spent so much and tickets and she thought it was going to be stupid...but she quickly changed her mind.  She wants to go again.  This show gives the term O-face a new meaning.
This is certainly not my first Cirque du Soleil show. I have been to a number of them in the past and they are my absolute favorite! O is no exception. Loved it, loved it! The performances are so good that they keep you at the edge of your seat during the entire show. The costumes are excellent, the lighting and the music, just so perfectly synchronized. They also have a cute gift shop just outside the theatre.. . Highly recommend when you are in the Sin City.
We got the tickets super last minute because our companions weren't sure whether they wanted to spend so much on show tickets.  Also, we were debating whether to watch O or Ka.  We finally decided on O because we were intrigued by the water aspect.  We figured it was something that was hard to replicate somewhere else, so might as well seize the opportunity while we were in Vegas.  With regards to the ticket prices, we just got the cheapest tickets and ended up sitting on the last row of the middle balcony.  . . The opening sequence was breathtaking but halfway through the show, i had to pinch myself to keep from dozing off.  There was just so much going on onstage that it was hard to focus.  Can anyone say sensory overload? After a  while, I just found it repetitive.  I don't know if being so far back was also a factor why I struggled to stay awake; I felt detached from the entire thing.  The clown bit was boring.  There was no story line.  Some acts were too long.  Maybe I expected too much from my first Cirque du Soleil show.  Sad to say, I was let down.  Maybe we should have just watched Ka.
E uno degli spettacoli piu belli che abbia mai visto.Se si va a CIN CITY  non si puo evitare di vederlo. . And one of the best shows I've ever see.if you go to CIN CITY you can not avoid seeing it
This is my third Cirque du Soleil show - I've watched Totem and Ka. While this was definitely the most whimsical and beautiful set (the stage was basically a huge pool) I felt that Ka was much better - in terms of storyline (O had zero storyline) and aerobatics stunts. O I felt was like watching one big synchronised swimming performance. Lovely but what's new? However, I did like the way the stage changes fluidly between sets. Some sets had dry land and some were all water... others was a mixture. The characters also has beautiful costumes and popped in and out of the water with such grace. The breathtaking high dives had us at the edge of our seats.. . I think a storyline would have helped tie the performance together better and made it easier for the audience to follow without "dozing off" as one Yelper put it. . . Tips for snacks: Don't get the mango freeze. It's way too sweet! Feels like drinking a pound of sugar. Pop-corn on the other hand was way too salty, almost as if they felt like they had to match the mango freeze's extreme levels of sugar just to be consistent.
This review is LOOOONG overdue, seeing as I saw O over five years ago.  But, regardless, I have to echo what most other people have said.  Everything about O is simply spectacular.   . . You can tell that a lot of time and effort is put into the choreography and the acting, and it definitely shows.  . . Some facts:. . * If you take the time to think about it while watching, you'll realize that there's actually a storyline to the show.. * Get there at least an hour in advance, because it gets PACKED and moving around will not be easy.. * Tickets are VERY pricey, more so than other Cirque du Soleil shows like Mystere (which I've also been to).. . 5 stars all the way
I honestly don't know why people are giving this show 5 stars. The show was a complete mess. Throughout the entire show people were running around the set randomly while 3-4 different acts were also all happening all at the same time. It was impossible to figure out what the hell was happening. There was no storyline, it had boring music, was chaotic, and quite expensive. And to top it off, they added a couple clowns that spent 20 minutes performing random pointless "comical" acts that weren't even remotely funny.   The divers are extremely talented but unfortunately the show was pure chaos and a waste of time.
This show is spectacular.
Fell short of expectation for the price I paid. The acrobats were great but I did not catch the theme of the show.
Was nothing at all like what I thought it would be. No spoilers here.. . Incredible acrobatic show incorporating a lot of different elements.. . You won't regret seeing this show.
My all time favorite!  Best seen from lower level.  Top notch.  I would see it over and over again!
i felt like i was watching a dream of mine. the water and circus act was out of this world. this is my second show and both are different but loved this one with the water element. ka was my first and enjoyed as much.
This show was great! I've been to five other Cirque shows and this was one of the best. I can see why some people go to see it several times, because it is such a feast for the eyes that there is always somewhere new to look. I was so enthralled with the flooring alone! The show is almost 2 hours long, which I liked. It felt like I got my money's worth for the number of acts. If you are only going to see 1 show in Vegas, I highly recommend this one.
