Every time someone mentions to me they are going to Vegas, I tell them they have to stop at secret pizza. One of my must stops in Vegas and the white slice is amazing. I love that is reasonably priced, large slices that come on paper plates and beer in a red solo cup. . If you're looking for a quick bite, this plate is great. Only a few chairs at the counter but I kinda think if you know about this place you're not too concerned with sitting.
Over hyped pizza place. Pricey pizza, limited toppings, nowhere really to sit, and not that tasty. Disappointed.. . If you want a  pizza that is fresh and super delicious then head over to MGM and eat at Project Pie. You won't regret it!
The existence of this place probably went something like this:. . John, the 20-something estranged culinary chef protege-dropout, came into the final meeting for the architect's last proposal on the hotel to borrow some cash from his father, Jeff.  Jeff was following the pitch quite well from the design firm, but was starting to drift off.. . The architect continued, "We can probably put a bathroom in here, but it won't be very big.  I propose that we just scrap--". . An idea hit the little hipster like a flash of lightning.. . "Dad," John interrupted.  "I want a pizza kitchen in there.". . Jeff: "Sorry.  But you've never owned a restaurant.  You'll fail.  There's hardly any room.  We can't afford any more signage to get people in there.". . "Dad," John repeated with a confidence his father had never heard before, "I want a pizza kitchen in there.  I'll run it.  It will succeed.  It needs nothing but my skill.". . "Oooookay, John.  If you say so.". . And Secret Pizza was born.. . --. . So we're sitting at a party and it's been a while since I was in the Vegas area and a friend of mine says, "Have you had Secret Pizza?". . And I was instantly intrigued.  "Huh?"  An hour later, we came up an escalator and found (though no sign, rhyme, or reason pointed to it) a dimly lit hallway.. . To my surprise, sure enough, I am greeted with a "Welcome!" Welcome to what?  Where am I?  How did the pinball machine get here? How come the arcade machine is broken?  Are we seriously watching the Clippers?  How come I'm asking myself so many questions?. . And so we order a pie from the New York accented worker and 20+ minutes later I'm chewing down on the best pizza I've ever had.  I've been to New York.  I've been to Italy.  It could have been the surreal nature of the place's existence, the hype that goes with it, the excitement of finding a hidden treasure - but it was.  the best.  pizza.. . We sat and watched people come and go.  Their non-brand Word processed menu was simply titled "PIZZA".  Yep.  Looks right, to me.. . If I have any friends visiting the area, I'm sending them here.
Perfect munchie food especially right after a night of clubbing! We came here on a Saturday night around 1:20 am after Marquee nightclub. We don't usually leave so early from a night club but all of us had a long day, but good thing we did because we got out just in time before more people did so the line for secret pizza was not too long for us! We probably waited a good 15 minutes until we were able to order. I asked the guy over the counter what does he recommend or what's the most popular pizza that people usually order here and he said the White Pizza. So I ordered one slice and it was delicious! It was a bit pricey $5.25 for a thin slice pizza but it was pretty worth it at that time. I think it's a better deal if you order by the pie but it does take awhile for them to make that where as when you order by the slice its already made.
Was really excited to try here after looking at all these positive reviews. I was shocked when I walked in and found pretty much no place to sit (4/5 bar stools total) and the smallest place ever. I guess its pretty much only to go. The menu is actually very basics and hardly any choices. We ended up getting 4 slices and sitting in the Cosmo lounge area. Pizza was very mediocre. Pieces were big and flimsy and toppings fell right off. It was just not good and strictly ate it since I was hungry. Okay at best. Won't go back, not worth 30$. Had much much better.
Simple and a bit overpriced, but so delicious. Perfect late night snack but there will be a long wait (which isn't so great when you've been in heels all night). There is a very small counter with a few stools, but luckily we were able to find some seats near the pool table right outside the entrance.
Decent pizza.. Nothing particularly special that'll make you want to come back. We ordered two large pizzas and had to wait 45min which may be fine if the pizza was awesome but it was just okay. Save yourself some time & just order what's already pre-made.
Everybody knows about this place by now so it's not all that secret. It's one of the best late night grub spots next to getting Earl of Sandwich or a steak dinner from Ellis Island. And if you are done partying at Marquee you are most likely to end up here.. . The first time I had their pizza I just bought whatever slices were available and it was good. It was cheesy and salty and the oily just melted my paper plate. Exactly how I wanted it. My most recent venture to Secret Pizza we ordered 2 whole pizzas to go. The wait was almost an hour, but when we got it that pie was gone in less then 5 minutes. It is just that much better when you have it hot and fresh.. . It's cheap and it's open late. What more can you ask for?
The name is no lie.. . This is one of Vegas' hidden gems.. literally. . . Head to the 3rd floor. and look for a pool table and then follow the most innocuous hallway down until you smell a slice of heaven.. and you will smell it.. . Wow is all I can say.. no signs and no frills with this spot. A great selection of different kinds of pizza's greets your eyes and it's one of the more difficult choices I had to make this trip.. . The girlfriend and I both opted for the "White Pizza" which was a garlic loaf style crust with mozzarella cheese, feta and homemade meatballs. . . They have the slices made already.. and then put it through the oven for you as you order. What a novel idea (Halifax pizza shops, I am looking at you). . Just delicious.. no other way to explain it. THE Best Slice I have ever had. Just moist, flavourful bites of heaven. Nearly ordered another slice or two for the plane ride home.. that damn good.. . Take my treasure map.. and find this golden treasure.
Super tasty pizza! Of all the times I've been here, it was a hit or miss with the lines. Thankfully I never had to wait too long. If I'm ever in the building I make an effort to stop by here. It's open late too! . . I don't think you can go wrong with any of the selection of pizzas that they have. They usually about about 3-5 different kinds to choose from. I would appreciate if more was available. I want to try everything!. . -1 star because they never seem to have slices of the white pizza available. . . Make sure to dash some red crushed peppers for a kick! Yum!
36.00 for a whole pizza.. the wait was about 30 mins.. did a phone order so i dont have to wait in line.. it's good but i wouldnt say i would wait for this.. the only reason i did it was because my friends wanted to eat this..
Believe the hypeee!! This place is soooo good.  My friends have been telling me that this place is amazing.  And usually when that happens I build up this high expectation that restaurants tend to not meet.  But this place did!!! Actually it was even better than I anticipated.  MUST GO!!  Especially if you're just leaving Marquee, it's a must :)
This little gem has no sign an is down a small, non-descript hallway to the right of the sushi place in the Cosmopolitan, Blue Ribbon (3rd floor east tower).. . They sell by the slice or for entire pies. Four of us split a pepperoni pie after watching Cirque du Soleil's "O" and drinking a fair amount. Best pizza I've had in awhile! Highly recommend you add it to your Vegas experience -- open late, when it's best.
Drunk food at its best! This little gem is hidden in Cosmo. Came here after a crazy night at Marquee. I was actually surprised the line wasn't longer but there was still a good amount of people. Line moves quick so no worries. . . Pizza slices are about $5 but really depends what you get. I tried the White Pizza and the Pepperoni and they were both amazing. My favorite one was the White Pizza. Not sure if I was just drunk and hungry or if the pizza was just THAT good.
Hidden in an alley between two larger restaurants in the Cosmopolitan, Secret Pizza is the ideal place for a relatively (relative to longer waits at sit-down restaurants during peak hours) quick bite. They serve up amazing custom pizzas by the slice or the entire pie. Our group came in during dinner time, so the line was pretty long, but customers walking out assured us it was worth the wait. Our group of five people ordered a custom pie, and it was more than enough to feed me and a bunch of hungry boys! We got the white pizza with five toppings, including a unique apple sausage and creamy cheese. Although the pizza is on the greasier side, it's the perfect indulgent pizza you want to find in a city like Vegas. The dough itself is pretty thin, barely enough to hold up all the cheese and toppings. I'm all about the crust, and this was one was baked to perfection with a crispy, charred outside and a doughy, chewy interior. The pizza is extremely generous in size, leaving me more than full after a slice and a half. I definitely recommend this spot to get some gourmet Vegas-worthy pizza on the go!
Completely and totally delicious (intoxication not necessary, haha!).  Both slices I had were a bit on the salty side (just the way I like it), and man that white pizza especially was just divine.  Quick service, friendly employees, just a really great spot.  . . Shout out to the girl in the elevator that told me how to get there or else I might have never found it!
Fun atmosphere, hidden hole-in-the-wall. Friendly employees. Pepperoni and meatball pizza was awesome.
On our third trip to the Cosmo we finally made time to find the "secret pizza" we had kept hearing about.  . . Love the premise of the "secret", because in LV there is nothing secret!  The atmosphere was perfect for the experience... The little dark hallway, into the "forbidden" space kind of feel.  It works.. . The pizza was just typical, good pizza for me.  Nothing truly spectacular about it... Other than some of the unusual combinations.  The service was the same... Nothing bad, just ordinary good service.. . I rate 5 stars because of the idea of the "secret", and that to me was a lot of fun.  And the music theme... Loved the old vinyl!  We will go back, for sure, but it isn't one of my MUST DOs on each visit to LV like The Henry, or Joyful House.
I guess there is a reason why this place is called Secret Pizza...because nobody wants you to find out about it since it sucks...pizza sucks, customer service sucks, the environment sucks, and finding the location sucks.. . My friends and I wanted pineapple in our pizza and they were extremely rude by saying they don't have fruit on their pizza. I think they should check their biology because tomatoes and peppers are a fruit!. . The sauce was tart, the crust tasted like cardboard and the wait was a waste of our time!
Shhh it's a secret. That's what all the staff members at MGM said when we asked where Secret Pizza was.. . The pizzas are pretty big and affordable. I think they're about $5 a slice but the slices are pretty big. They have your normal everyday toppings such as truffle cheese, pepperoni, etc. Swing by here if you're hungry and don't want to spend too much at a fancy restaurant.
I don't know why this always has such high reviews because the pizza sucks. Both of the times I had it, it was super dry and it's cold by the time you get to actually consume it. There is always a long line and well, yea, it just sucks.Overall - it sucks. Oh and it sucks. If you want great pizza, call the Treasure Island front desk and have them route you to their pizza place - it delivers to any hotel and it is TO DIE FOR.
Order a whole pizza pie and take it back to the room :) . . It's expensive but so is everything else on the strip.
I was surprised that so many good reviews for this pizza. So I went to find it, it's really hard to find it by yourself since it isn't on the list near the escalator. Better to ask the persons working there. . . The place is small and simple, very different from the environment. I cared about the environment of the restaurant a lot! This place is not a good place, I have to say.. . But the taste is good, I think. If u want to have a meal fast, it would be ur option.
I have to say that the pizza here is as good as I have had in LA and NY! Secret Pizza is a hidden jewel at the Cosmopolitan, and I always make sure to hit it up at least once per trip! Their homemade meatball is divine, and their crust makes the pizza!
After a night out clubbing, this is the perfect place to end the night! Pizza hits the spot! The line can get obnoxiously crazy but it's worth it. Favorite one is the white pizza, I die! Lol! Pepperoni was also really good. I had 4 huge slices that night, it was worth all the calories... Hahaha! The staff were super nice too! Tip for the girls: just flirt a bit with them and they'll make your order a tad bit faster! LOL! It's not too bad especially when there's a couple of cute pizza guys there... ;)
Great place for a good slice of pizza. Prices aren't bad either. Go at an off time to avoid the wait.
On my most recent trip to the Cosmopolitan (which was for a work conference) I had a free night for dinner and was totally on my own so I decided to grab some pizza and a beer for dinner. After a little wandering around I managed to find Secret Pizza's location. It was somewhat of a let down because I didn't really care for their pizza or beer selection. I guess I am not hipster enough for cheap beer in plastic cup. I don't remember exactly what the choices were but it was the mass produced watered down stuff like Bud, Miller, Coors, etc. The pizza itself was pretty greasy and tasted like most (if not all) of the ingredients had come out of a jar or can. Don't get me wrong, it probably would hit the spot after a night clubbing but for a dinner after a long work day it was a big disappointment. On top of that there is not much seating and there were some very loud children playing with the arcade games that are in there. I ended up taking my pizza and plastic cup back to my room and leaving half a slice in the mini fridge when I checked out the next day.
I had high expectations when I came here. I think this place is popular because it has no name and just known as secret pizza. The pizza is ok. Hardly any seating. It kind felt like I was getting pizza at the mall. The staff was friendly and it wasn't too expensive.
The first time I had secret pizza which was about a year ago, I thought it was amazing, the best pizza I've ever had and deserved 5 stars. The pizza crust was thin, moist, yet crispy, the cheese and sauce was also very flavorful.    . . However, I had them again a year later (which was week ago), and it really tasted and looked like they went a couple notches down in the ranks. . . The line is annoyingly long as usual after the club and around 1:30-3am, and the customers in line were mostly obnoxious, naked wasted, tired, with a sprinkle of jerks trying to hustle you a $20 slice of pizza. . . Prices: . Cheese pizza $4.75. $0.50 a topping . . We ordered: . 1 slice Pepperoni pizza $5.25. 1 slice Sausage and pepperoncini pizza $5.75. 1 Coke - Served in a standard red solo cup and no refills $4. . Total damage: $15 (for 2 slices and a drink). . As much as I love thin crust pizza, theirs was all sorts of soggy and mushy this time around. Last year, it was actually crisp and held the pizza topping well. Also, they really salt bombed the crap out of it. It was soggy doughy, and salty. Not what I would like to expect from my beloved secret pizzeria.. . Plus, there is never any Parmesan in those shakers on the countertops and the countertops are always greasy and filthy from previous drunk people. I never see any employees out on the floor refreshing and keeping the store front tidy. . . I'm reconsidering making a mission to come here next time for my after hours pizza pick me up. Well, not unless I'm already in the area.
The not so secret, Secret Pizza, has been in my bookmarks for a long time. Since I'm pretty sure everyone knows exactly where this place is by now, I won't go to far into it's whereabouts. But, if you do happen to have a hard time finding it, here's a little tip. There's a strange little glass elevator on the 3rd floor...look just to the left of that and you'll see the dark, but wondrous, hallway to pizza heaven. You're welcome.. . Inside you'll find an arcade game, a few counters to stand at while you eat, and the pizza counter itself. Yup, that's it. After you place your order, you make your way down the line and pay for it at the register. Now, I'm not sure if anyone's really paid much attention but there's well over a grand hanging up on the wall as a decoration near the register too. Maybe a slightly over the top take on the ole' first dollar made thing? I don't know, but it was fun to look at it.. . The pizza selection itself is decent. They have single slices in several varieties, including their infamous white pizza, as well as full pies and somewhat of a build your own option. I also saw a few deep dish slices sitting out but they were huge, and at $8 a slice, I didn't think I'd be able to finish it all. So, I opted for just a single slice of the white. . . With all the hype, I was actually surprised at how good this pizza was. And sure, it's $5 a slice, but they are so big it was easily justified in my eyes...and stomach. Plus the flavors are great and the crust is on point. I really dug the large clumps of ricotta with the hint of garlic, and it's not overly greasy either. Perfectly foldable, and delicious. No complaints and I'm dying to go back to try a slice with some meat added to it. One of the workers said sausage really adds to the white pie.. . One thing I suggest is trying to hit this place up in an off time, if possible. We missed a big rush of people just before 6pm, but as we were leaving, the line was starting to hit the hallway. With standing counter space for only about a dozen people, you might end up juggling your greasy pizza plate and your beer filled red solo cup while tourist play running back to the counter. That wouldn't be good.. . If you've yet to try Secret Pizza, what are you waiting for? Surely not a tip on how to find it. Just get down here already!
I'm usually pretty wary of places that are "hyped up" by the yelp community, cause more often than not they actually suck, but this place is actually good, surprisingly so.. . It's called Secret Pizza because there's no flashing lights and a million advertisements pointing to the place. Which I'm sure they think is very edgy, but I just enjoy watching idiot tourists walk around searching in desperation for a sign to show them the way. Think you're in the wrong city for that.. . The wait was a little long, but it was reasonable considering the high volume of shmoozies that were there. My friends and I stick to our traditional and delicious plain cheese pizza, and it was large and awesome. Not too greasy, a very generous size for a large, and the price is right.
I was so excited to try this pizza place after my friend told me about it because it was hidden and it had amazing yelp reviews! But I was disappointed. It was a lot of fun to find and I love the concept of the the best kept secret, but this really is not what it is.. . The service to start with was pretty shitty and probably discriminatory. My friend and I are in the service industry so we would never be one of those rude or extremely picky guests so I know it had nothing to do with our personalities. We witnessed guests in front of us receive friendly service from the cashier lady's good side. With us, she rolled her eyes and rushed us. I was prepared to let that go, givenextremely good pizza.. . Annnnd the pizza was okay. It was nothing to rave about. I might be bias because I favorite NY style pizza and this was just not close at all. The crust was plain, not enough sauce or cheese and the topping was okay. . . It was a fun little hunt inside the Cosmo though, just wish the treasure tasted better.
Sub par pizza. Go here for drunk munchies only or you wont enjoy it. It is extremely pricey.  For a large pie with 3 toppings, it was roughly 30 or so. Also the pizza was dry, and if we didn't call ahead the  wait would have been extremely long. Weak pizza
A good pizza to me is all about the crust.  It was really pricey for a whole pizza ($36) but the crust was really good! I love that they're open late so my friends and I were able to come after the club.  We phoned in our order and took the pizza back upstairs to our room.  With the phone in order, we waited for about 30 minutes.
Somewhat hidden on 3rd floor hallway near Marquee. Good luck! :)
Love this SH!t... and the fact that tourist don't know about till they meet some locals is the best. Any time we end the night on the strip we hit up the cosmo for pizza and hot girls. There's no where to sit and a couple standing tables but its good cuz it makes you mingle.
Found this place on yelp, awesome! We were the only guys there, cheap pizza, cheap drinks, great music. No complaints!
Tricky to find, but well worth it. A good slice of New York style pizza, thin crust and greasy as all hell.. . It's in the east tower, third floor, near a pool table. Look for people coming out if a little hallway with pizza in their hands.
I'm pretty sure that the secret is out because the line was all the way down the hall and around the corner. However, I get why people are willing to wait in a line like that at 2AM. This pizza is exactly what you need in the middle of the night before passing out or rallying before hitting up another club. It is pretty pricey for one slice, but whatever, it is Vegas Strip. I will be coming here for every Vegas trip from now on because its just the kind of place that you have to hit up.
One of the best New York style pizzas I've ever had. This place really is a secret in that it's probably impossible to find unless you ask someone. It's down this remote corridor with no signage or anything. There was also a bit of a line, but boy the pizza was worth every minute of the wait.. . The slices are a decent size and the flavor is awesome. the crust is beautifully crispy. I would eat the crust by itself as a loaf of bread. That's the secret to an awesome pizza in the first place. Add to that flavorful fresh ingredients and you have a winner.. . Just an FYI - don't expect a restaurant type setting. There are a couple of bar stools, but basically it's a take it to go type of place. Again, the win is in the food itself. Really good.. . I highly recommend Secret Pizza to anyone visiting the Vegas Strip.
