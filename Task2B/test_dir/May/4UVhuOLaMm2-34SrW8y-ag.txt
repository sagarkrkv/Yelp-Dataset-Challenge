I don't get it. I have heard rave reviews about this place for the past 7+ years, especially for late nights. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I'm quite certain the food is just sub-par. I went out with 3 lovely ladies and we ordered a TON of food. I'm not certain I even remember it all but it went a little something like this: squid in squid ink, squid roll with uni on top, uni in yuzu sauce, spider roll, spicy tuna roll, shrimp fried rice, vegetable tempura bowl, ma po tofu, beef tongue skewers, chicken skewers, calamari, wagyu beef carpaccio, and potato and beef stuff. Some of the items were alright like the yakitori, and the carpaccio, but everything else we ordered, I have had far better elsewhere. . . The squid in squid ink was far too salted, all the sushi was mediocre and the uni wasn't top notch, potato beef bowl had a pewtrid aftertaste, and the worst was the slimy ma po tofu. It was so slimy and weird! This is a decent spot if you're looking to sample many various types of Japanese cuisine in one spot, but they don't seem to do any of it very well. After a disappointing dinner, we figured the honey toast wouldn't let us down. Oddly enough, none of us have ever tried to, so we ordered one vanilla and one green tea. I'd say honey toast definitely looks better than it tastes, although the one we received didn't look that great either. The sides were extra toasty, and they didn't seem to saturate the toast enough with honey, so it was very dry. All of us ended up just eating the middles and leaving two huge shells of honey toast on the table. I did however, appreciate the green tea ice cream by itself. The vanilla honey toast was way too sweet being covered in honey. Overall, I will certainly never be returning. I'll save that space for all the fobby Asians that are stampeding through the doors.
Had dinner here about 11 pm Sat/3 May:. - Showed up without reservations and the place was busy so I had a 15 min or so wait before I was seated at the bar by the hostess (per my preference).. - $3.95 draft Kirin or a big bottle of Kirin/Sapporo/Asahi ($6?) were good deals.. - I really enjoyed the pork belly + egg (my favorite that night) and octopus.  The cow's tongue skewer and chicken gizzards + garlic were good.
First time here and definitely coming back. It's packed, and on a Monday. Was not impressed with the limited menu at first but quickly realized there were dishes listed on the wall.  A lot of them.  We sat near the kitchen which gave me a chance to eye out dishes I'll try in the future.  Service was quick, and the food came out quick which helps the crowd turnover.  Speed did not impede on quality.  Started off with the fire roasted eggplant and cold baby bokchoy. Both were refreshing.  Ichiza's ramen dx did not disappoint. Neither did an inexpensive and satisfying shrimp tempura bowl, served over a bed of rice and tempura flakes.  Of course, do not leave without a serving of honey toast.
I stop by Ichiza every time I go to Vegas. Having grown up in Japan, I can tell you that this izakaya is legit. Since I've lived in Salt Lake City, UT for the last 8 years, this is the closest 'real Japan' I can get to. On my most recent trip, we ordered:. - Gobo wrapped in pork skewers. - Potatoes wrapped in beacon skewers . - Yakitori (skewered chicken). - Small ramen. - Shrimp Gratin (it's like a creamy casserole but with rice instead yummm!!). I really wish we had a joint like this in SLC. I would eat here every day, no joke!!!
Bomb ramen. All the other food is delicious. Always worth the wait. They can always do most specials any day. Love the atmosphere and service. Never have been let down by this place.
I came to Ichiza with my family because everyone was raving about it. The food is cheap, but the waiting time to get your food is so long--15 minutes just for a rice bowl, really? Blah. . My parents didn't wanna try again, so it sucked that I couldn't get them to come back. . . The next time I was here was when I had a Lolita fashion meet-up. It was dinner time, so it was busier than lunch time, but the waiting time for my food is equally as long--perhaps even longer. I think I waited 20-30 minutes for my bowl.. . I'd come back here if service was faster; otherwise, I'd rather head over to nearby Shuseki. It's quieter and faster, too!. . * If you want to order more things at Ichiza besides what's on the menu, look at all the paper postings on the walls. They have some hidden gems on there.
Food and service so authentic the wait staff barely understands English.. Protip:. If you can read the kanji on the walls, you'll get the most interesting/freshest food daily.
For a moment I didn't feel as though I was still in Vegas... What an awesome little place! We sat at the bar and watched the chefs make the meals. That was fun! They also have an area where shoes aren't allowed! The atmosphere was fast paced and loud and I loved it. . . We ordered a sushi roll, a yellow tail tar tar, and beef tataki. All were absolutely fresh and phenomenal. . . We had a bottle of sake as well. It was super yummy! . . I Can't wait to go back!
So I've been wanting to try Ichiza for the longest time. It was girls night so I suggested we go to Ichiza. The lady told me that we needed at least 3 people in our party to make a reservation but luckily I had a party of 4. The parking lot stinks but if you can get parking then it works out. We ended up rushing upstairs as we were running a little late. . . The verdict. The food was ok. I don't really recall anything that stood out to me that said OMG you have to come back! Now that I look back I don't really remember what I ate except for the fact that I took pictures. I remember the uni being decent and the Wagyu carpaccio as well. We had ordered a lot of food and I felt everything was just mediocre. Maybe I went on an off day but it was a Friday night and people were waiting regardless of the fact that there were open tables. The menu is all over the place so that was a bit annoying. One wall had specials and then another had more specials. For those sitting by the window it is tough to see these specials and you just felt rude walking to someone else's table to look at the writing on the wall. . . Overall I thought that the honey toast would save the night but it didn't. The green tea ice cream was good but the toast was so dry and I was like I'm never ordering honey toast again! Ichiza was a big let down and I hope that if I ever do come back again I won't be as disappointed.
Izakaya in Vegas? Sure, why not?. . Some of the advantages about coming here early (like 5 PM when the store just open) are plenty of available parking spaces and none of crazy waiting line. Nothing superb about the service, staffs got the job done and we all got our food in an orderly fashion. . . 31. Garlic Baby Bokchoy (stir-fried baby bokchoy with garlic soup - $3.95): Simple and decent dish. Tasted just like how my mom would cook it - garlic soup wasn't too crazily salty, but I do think $4 is a bit pricey. . . 45. Kushi-tan (most tender beef tongue - $2.25 each): A huge hit. Beef tongue was grilled perfectly with just the right seasoning. Now that's something you don't get to enjoy everyday. . . 52. Black Cod Fish Fillet (Black cod fish [butterfish] marinated with miso-sauce - $9.95): Definitely a miss for me. Texture is pretty good, but simply too salty. I would rather exchange one black cod for four beef tongues. . . 91. Ichiza's Ramen DX (Ichiza's ramen with kakuni and half egg, half size): A hit for me. This ramen reminded me of champon ramen at Hana Ichimonme in Los Angeles (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hana-ichimonme-restaurant-los-angeles). Broth is milky and flavorful. Kakuni wasn't too bad and I can taste vegetable in the bowl here and there. Not the most amazing ramen, but I was pretty impressed with it. . . More hits than misses - just stick with Yelp's recommendation and you will have an enjoyable experience.
for a moment, it was like i was just sitting in hondaya back in LA, sitting on a table, drinking hot sake, eating gyutan ( beef tongue), eating ramen ...oh man......now that's what you call..great experience. . it's an izakaya that opens till late, i can imagine all thethings that goes on here, get ramen dx, you'll love it, its unique, it's different, its amazing, oyako don is good too (chicken and egg bowl), oh man...i dont even want to start counting the calories..but f**k it.....what happens in vegas stays in vegas....my calories didn't get the memo though......they came back with me ;D
Nice place to stop by for some quick bites. Of course I had to get the honey box toast which is amazing and so was the yellowtail tartare. Menu is kinda confusing though because they have things posted on the walls and they only serve items on a skewer for dinner:/. The place smells kinda weird though and seating is very limited.
Honey toast.  For reals.  Just do it, it will be the one thing in your life you know for a fact you will not regret.. . There were a good number of vegetarian items on the menu.  The tofu steak was good, but I think I like the agedashi tofu better.  I also got the garlic baby bok choy, and have not stopped thinking of it since.  Surprisingly, it was my favorite thing.  Miso soup was okay, but not as good as others I've had.. . Honey toast, ya'll.
Yummy eats for later at night.. . Order the "ham-bah-gah" as they call it. I think it is a ground beef patty and I thought it was pretty tasty, especially after a late night of walking around the strip. They are open pretty late and a lot of what theyhave to serve are listed up on the walls and not in a menu that you can hold.. . I had hot green tea. It was also pretty good when it is fairly cold during the winter months in Las Vegas. . . Overall, really good late night eats. I will be returning!!!
I don't know how this place got good reviews I ordered the tuna and tofu salad, it was so bland I had to send it back, ordered a tongue skewer and it looked so dry and tasted so salty.. My girlfriend ordered a tofu soup and also said she couldn't eat it because it was super salty ... Bad decision
The Ramen with veggies was great! The Tom yum roll delicious! I even tried beef tongue for the first time ever and it was not bad at all! And the honey toast is AMAZING!!! I definitely will be here again.
Food is great as always, however the past few times their service has been horrible. We ordered 6 items at once and each dish came out about 15-20 minutes apart. Between the four of us we were starving.
This is my favorite spot to eat in vegas. I am in love with the authenticity of the food. The beef bowl is a must every time I come here. There is a wait every time I come herealthough every time is worth the wait. The owner is very nice and the servers are great too.
