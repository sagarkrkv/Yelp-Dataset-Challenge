After posting my review I was contacted and reimbursed for the dinner portion of our visit.
We didn't eat here. We waited a sec for a table in the rapidly emptying restaurant at 10:00 and they stuck us in a corner. Why pay for a view that you won't see? We left and went down to Mon Ami Gabi instead.
This restaurant has mixed reviews and it seems tied to how much people have paid.  We come here for brunches/lunches where the price point is not that high though there is an inherent pressure to have a drink.  Our favorite has been the french toast in a quiet place with good views and overall pleasant staff.
Had table overlooking fountains. Food was outstanding, as  expected. Had the Arctic Chard and is was just the right texture. Great service too.
The view is good.  The food is alright.  For the price you pay for fine dining, atmosphere and service, you have better choice in Vegas.  The only good thing is the souffle
Food is ok, the view is amazing. You pay a high price for the view because there are much better restaurants as far as food goes.  Atmosphere is ok, waiters are not very friendly. The souffle was great!
I have reviewed them before but when you attain such excellence in dining you deserve another shoutout!!. . Eating at this restaurant is an experience so do not go if you are in a rush because it deserves to be savored like a fine wine.. . The service is second to none and everyone from the hostess to the waitstaff treats you like they are genuinely happy you are there.. . Food is amazing I can't even begin to describe the deliciousness. Started with the blue cheese souffle and it is to die for. The duck and chicken are cooked to perfection.. . Ended the evening with the pistachio souffle and it was so tender and perfectly cooked! Don't miss this experience it is worth every cent!
Yes! Came here for my Birthday during our trip to Vegas this year. My girlfriend made reservations in advance, made sure I got the best seat in the house complimented by red roses which she bought from the restaurant (very nice touch). We were seated at a half-moon table overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The service was top notch. I enjoyed my salmon a lot. My girlfriend liked her steak although it wasn't her absolute favorite. The green beans were average. What blew me away was the desert. Because it was my birthday they brought me complimentary mouse, which was delicious. We had also ordered a white chocolate banana elysee, which came out to be a work of culinary art. Amazing thin circles of white chocolate layered with fresh bananas and a torched sugar arc. Just amazing. Highly recommend this experience and can not wait to go back.
Can't beat the view. However, though they have offer many various High end foods. The quality doesn't seem match the price. The service is great, the food is beautiful. But if the price matches the taste? I had better. Will not come back unless there is a special occasion and requested by anyone. Otherwise, it is not a must list.
I wanted to find a nice, romantic place for anniversary dinner with my wife and oh my goodness did I find the right one.  From beginning to end dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant was perfect.. . It starts with the private elevator from the hotel floor up to the elevated restaurant part way up the replica Eiffel Tower at the Paris hotel.  The elevator doors open up to a great view of the working kitchen and a friendly hostess there to guide us over to check-in.  The view is the first thing you notice as the walls are all windows and overlook the strip and particularly the Bellagio lake / water show.  Particularly for couples, all of the two person tables are right up next to the windows with amazing views.  The layout and settings are all beautiful and classy French steakhouse style.  The service, from beginning to end, was great as well.. . The big surprise, for me at least, was that the food was amazing too!  I expected good food amplified by the setting and view, but the food was good enough to stand alone and even justify the hefty prices (at least along the strip).  I had the NY steak, which was one of the best steaks I  have had in a long time including some of the best steakhouses here in Los Angeles, andmy wife had the Turbotin (fish) which she raved about as well.  Side dishes, souffle dessert, and wine/drink selections were all great as well.. . Bottom line, if you want to splurge and have a really great dinner in a beautiful setting, this is the best place on the strip to do it.
