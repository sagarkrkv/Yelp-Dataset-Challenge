We stayed at the Venetian for 3 nights when we visited Las Vegas. Absolutely amazing experience, from spaciousness of the room to the cleanliness, to the decor and the service.. . Our room overlooked the swimming pool and it was really nice to pull one of the chairs by the window, watching people in the swimming pool and reading a book. The Venetian has so many great restaurants (Bouchon, Grand Lux Cafe, Trattoria Reggiano, Grimaldi's etc) and just strolling around was a lot of fun. So romantic and relaxing, actually!. . We enjoyed our experience and would definitely stay at the Venetial again when we visit Vegas the next time!
This place is all about the hotel and the shops.  It's a great place to visit and have fun.  They are more expensive than a lot of the other casinos.  The Bourbon Room (bar) is a total rip off.  Don't order a beer or a drink there.  You'll pay more than you think.
Speaking only in regards to the decor, this place is incredible. The canals and St. Marks square is breathtaking, and will impress virtually anyone you bring here. . . Not only is it beautiful, but with all the people around and the singing gondola singers, you feel like you're really in Italy. One of my favorite places on the strip.
I used to come here all the time because my dad worked for sands, the rooms are amazing and the food is great. The Venetian stays modern and still is great for its age. But the lobby smells like a casino..
Beautiful. They have wonderful paintings. They have gondola rides for both inside & outside. Me, my bro, his gf & my bf took the inside one, because of the lovely paintings & scenery we got to see. Few bridges we got to go under too. Venetian is all about Italy & thats why it looks the way it does. Totally Italy look... . I recommend anyone to experience riding the Gondola ride. If you don't, you can still see all the beautiful paintings at this hotel. You have to visit this hotel while visiting Vegas...
I looove the Venetian. I stayed at the Bella suite for my birthday and fell in love with the interior of the hotel, it was beautiful! Especially the fountain they have out front ha our go to spot for a group picture. It was a very comfortable and clean stay and the bathroom was my favorite part. What more can a girl ask for? BUT I was deathly hungover the next day and in need of some Gatorade so I called to have some Gatorade delivered and I paid $20 for two bottles. Pricey much? Next time I will just go down and get something myself.
The rooms here are nice, although the phone chargers take forever to charge your phone.  Just bring your own charger and you'll be all set.. . The particular thing about the Venetian that I would like to highlight and recommend is the exhibits that they have near the front desk when you walk in.  I have been to both the Leonardo Da Vinci exhibit that they had and the National Geographic's Best Photos Exhibit.  Both were wonderful!. . The Leonardo Da Vinci Exhibit was amazing, they took his famous notebooks that he wrote and they built a lot of the items in them so that you can see the concept come to life.  It also features a huge blow up of the Mona Lisa and a history on it.  I am well read on Da Vinci and love him, and there was even information in there that was new to me, like about the water spot under her eye because Napoleon used to own her and hung her in his bathroom (Really, Napoleon, you giant jerk?)  Anyways, it was a great experience.. . The National Geographic exhibit was also awesome.  It was a gallery of their 50 best pictures, or top 25, I can't really remember, but it was amazing.  I took my sister to this and she also loved it.  The exhibits tell the background story of the photograph and some include the frames that were shot along with the photo.  The photos are beautiful and the stories behind them are just as beautiful.  Definitely worth going to.. . The ceiling in the entryway when you come in off of the strip next to Tao and the Candy Store thing is beautiful, you can lose track of time looking at the beautiful detail.  The Gondola's are also worth seeing.  I haven't ridden them, but they are so neat to look at especially if you have kids.  The St Mark's Square area is also pretty cool.. . Overall, its a beautiful casino and hotel, Las Vegas should be proud to have it.
We have been coming to Vegas almost 10 years now, and the Venetian is our favorite hotel. Their standard rooms are better than other hotels, larger and more luxurious. The location is great, close to most of the hotels we like to visit. . The casino is nice as well, and we like gambling there.  There are great choices for restaurants too.  And the pool is beautiful, even though the music does seem to compete with the music from Tao beach.
Gorgeous hotel! Didn't stay here but did you know Carlos from the food channel has a bakery here?!?! WHAT WHAT?!?! Yummerz. Be prepared for 1+ hour long wait though.
In summary: On its way from classy to ashy.. . My most recent stay was Christmas 2013 and am apparently still bothered enough to write a review half a year later. The room had a very strong odor of fried food and funky oil, strong enough that we're pretty sure the room is on top of a kitchen or has poor exhaust vents. For multiple reasons we did not bring it up at the time to switch rooms, but in retrospect I wish I had. After being bombarded with cigarette smoke, fake vanilla pumping through the casinos, the last place I want to smell is a hotel room. . . Even after we checked out, the clothes in our suitcase smelled like it'd gone through a shift at a McDonalds. No biggie right? Maybe if I weren't headed straight to a family reunion where I'd be meeting BF's extended family for the first time!. . I guess where it really gets sour is when I contacted them immediately after we got home, I received an obviously canned response like it wasn't the first time someone had complained and said we should have brought it up while we were there. I wasn't looking for comps or a future upgrade, just an acknowledgement and at least lip service they'd look into it and fix it for future guests. . . The rooms are spacious but over the years they are starting to show their age with stained carpet, peeling wallpaper and dented furniture. There are always newer places to stay so if they don't keep up, people will go elsewhere.. . If you don't know, now you know.
Stayed at the Venetian for the first time last weekend and had a blast!. . The hotel staff was outstanding. Prior to arriving, I requested that my King suite be placed next to my friends' Bella suites, if possible. Staff immediately accommodated this request. When I checked in, the front desk staff already had my request noted in their system and put me next door to my friends. I also requested a few items, such as a cork screw, throughout my stay and the staff delivered within minutes.. . Love the fact that TAO Nightclub and TAO Beach are located at the Venetian. We had guest list to TAO Beach and it was easily one of the better Vegas pool parties that I've been to. My group had fun at TAO Nightclub...probably because it was less crowded than usual. Or maybe it was the fact that the DJ didn't make my ears bleed by playing non-stop EDM. Either way, it was fun.. . I probably would give the Venetian five stars if my suite had a damn MINI-FRIDGE. Come on, even most Motel 6's have one. I thought I had found the mini-fridge, but I was informed that it was actually a "refreshment center." What the hell is a refreshment center? It's something that looks like a mini-fridge, but only holds hotel beverages that charge to your account if you slightly move them. . . Would I stay here again? Probably.
DO NOT GO HERE--THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY!. . We booked 4 suites for 16 people. We put down a deposit. I logged onto my account to discover that they have charged me DOUBLE for the deposits. I immediately called and was told that I would be credited within 5 to 10 business days. A total of THREE WEEKS with no credit to my account. I called again and they claimed that it's my bank's fault that I don't have my credit yet. WOW. Passing on the blame! Customer service was rude. I called my bank...they don't even show a pending credit. Now I have to file a claim against them with my bank to get my money back. I've sent customer service several emails----didn't even respond. Don't book here! They are theives!
My new favorite place to stay while in Las Vegas.  Great room with remote control shade and drapes, sunken living area, and very nice bathroom.  The hotel staff were great and very helpful.  Inside there were a ton of shops and restaurant choices.  I visited the pool and while they aren't deep, they are a great escape and area to relax.  Loved my stay here.
This was by far my favorite hotel that I visited while in Vegas. It was breathtaking. The ceilings were painted like the Sistine chapel. Most of the stores and restaurants were way out of my price range, but there's nothing wrong with a little window shopping. Every hour or so performers put on a show with singing, dancing, and a little interactive acting. There is a little river with boats you can ride on and a guy or gal rowing the boat will sing to you in Italian. Very cool!
At the time of year 2002, the Venetian was the top of line for me. The hotel stay was about $250 a night. I stayed with friends for about 3 nights. The room was huge having 2 queen beds and a sofa queen bed. There were 2 TVs.  One TV in the sofa area and another in the 2 queen beds area. The only issue is that if you remove or move a any items in the refrigerator, then you would be charged that rate for the removed item. I was charged a rate, in which my friend argued with them and they removed the charge.  . . Now it should be a 3 star hotel. . I have stayed at the Venetian back in 2010 and it was not well taken care of. For better rooms, you would need to stay in the Venezia or the Palazzo. . . The rating of this room is still ok, but not as clean and taken care of as the rest of the other hotels.
The Venetian embodies the meaning of luxury. The rooms are nothing like you would find at any other hotel, you feel like a high roller even in the standard suite. The Casino is massive and has its own signature scent. I recommend this hotel if you need some pampering.
First time to stay here. One of the hotels I have been looking forward to stay in  Las vegas. The room didn't disappoint me. I like the style. Very modern and clean with a little mix of European theme of course. The service was ok. Maybe because we came here in the busiest time of the year. The room rate is too pricey as well of course. The swimming pool is one of the pride of this hotel. I love it. Just like other hotels, casino and restos are in the first floor. One thing about this hotel which I didn't like is, it's such a big maze. It's hard to get from point a to Point b because it's big and the directions are very confusing. Another thing- the bell desk guy didn't take care of our luggage so one of my friends bag got a huge tear at the bottom and she lost her cellphone charger, we address the issue but the lady just told us to go to Walgreens and get a new one. Wth. They never make up with what happen. But otherwise I still love the hotel because of the European theme and design but hopefully will improve the service.
I absolutely loved the Venetian. We stayed in a pretty large suite, so I am not sure how the basic suite stacks up. It's interesting to see so many mixed reviews because I didn't find anything wrong with the place. Clean, friendly, accomodating staff.... . . The ventilation didn't bother me- and I am not a smoker and can't stand second hand smoke. It's a great location with fabulous resaurants. My favorite was one I cant remember the name. It was a chineese restaurant near the craps tables. Authentic,  delicious. . . The resort is also positioned right smack where you want to be in the strip, near Ceasars, MGM, Bellagio, Aria and so on.. . The bathroom in our suite was the highlight, totally romantic. Feels funny to, say, but true.. . I really couldn't find anything wrong with the place. . . Great dealers. The only reason I gave four stars out of five is due to the decline in the black jack pay out, from the average 3:2 to 6:5. . . The babe and I love all the table games and black jack is a highlight for both of us, so it's disappointing they lowered the pay out:(
We had a great experience at the Venetian! I won a few nights free from a game show and only had to pay the resort fee which included super fast in suite wifi so I didn't mind. The lady at the front desk upgraded our room to include a view of the pool because she saw my birthday was a few days earlier. We had a luxury suite which was the standard room but there was nothing standard about it. It was seriously nicer than my apartment! Just absolutely beautiful! The bed was like sleeping on a cloud and the bathtub was huge and luxurious! I took off one star because getting to our room was slightly confusing having to use 2 different elevators and the food was pretty pricey. Plus it is basically at the end of the strip so we had to walk far or take a cab to some places. If you have the money though, it was pretty incredible and everyone was very friendly. Would love to stay there again!
I'm more of a fan of staying near the center of the strip (Aria/Planet Hollywood), but we decided to finally try something new and book a room here. We booked the Bella Suite and the size of the room was perfect. The beds were comfy, the flat screen televisions were nice, and the living room had a full office setup if you needed it (which one of our guests did). I'm a big fan of nicely done bathrooms and this place didn't disappoint (not as good as Aria's though), but I never understood why some of the nicer hotels don't believe in locks for their bathroom doors. My biggest (andonly) gripe was navigating through the hotel. We were located in the Venezia tower and we had to take multiple elevators and go down several halls to get to our hotel room (which is not an easy task after a long night of Vegas antics). Also my cousin parked in the garage and that took quite some time to find because of the specific elevators you needed to take to get there. Even the employees gave unclear directions.. . The actual hotel was great. There is a large shopping mall attached if that interests you and also tons of restaurants that are actually worth going to if you are looking to splurge a bit. The crowd here is generally a little older than some of the more "hip hotels" (which can be both a good and bad thing). I'm not a fan of TAO, but the hotel is located close enough to Wynn/Encore so it's easy to go there for all your clubbing needs.
Stayed here back in March . I dropped a 40 dollar "sandwich" on the counter . It was swept away quickly and I am still unsure if I received anything . . Anyways my loss. The resort is great though rooms are beautiful .The gym was very nice too .Pool are beautiful and lots of seating .. I was pleased that  they didn't take your drinks away ,or even search you when you entered the pool area or hot tubs . And the pool and hot tubs on the 10th floor I think it was ,were open until 10 pm . . . Wi-fi was also available everywhere. . . Overall one of the best resorts I have stayed in .
Room was gorgeous and we got a really great deal :) One of my favorite places to stay at in Vegas. Staff is super friendly and courteous.
The room was beautiful , very east to get confused ! Gondola ride nice but short! Glass table in the living area a bit oversized i hit it twice bruised and scratched had to fill out an incident report ,which took over an hour wasn't happy! They did come remove glass though! Overall nice but don't hurt yourself !
Did Venetian/Palazzo for shopping and a meal.  I actually prefer the Venetian.  They had liver performances in "square" that were good and just sitting and having a bite, enjoying the entertainment and people watching was enjoyable even if locals would call it 'touristy".  So what?  Tourists come here for a reason.
