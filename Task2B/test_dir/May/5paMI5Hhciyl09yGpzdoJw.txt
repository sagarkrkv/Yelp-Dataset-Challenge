. The Venetian. . 60. . . . . . 
Five Star accomodations in relationship to its 2.5 Star prices.  This place has incredible value in possibly the best location on the strip..... Grimaldi's, Table 10.... great food at reasonable prices.  . Its all good!
I love staying to this place. From check in to check out, hotel staff make you feel special and taken care off. The price is reasonable for the great service.
This hotel is top of the line. The rooms are awe inspiring when you walk in. The bottom of the barrel rooms are huge. . The pool area is great. They have actually changed the pools in the past two years, but still nice, although I liked them better when they had the chairs in the water. . . I also love the black jack tables at the pool. Some of the best around. . . Restaurants in the hotel are great. Carnevino is unbelievable. Just be prepared to pay for it. . Best place in Vegas to stay if you can pay for it. Not most expensive, but higher than average. . . Casino does not stink like smoke which is nice as well.
"Room with a View". . When my parents visit they split their stay between my place and The Strip. Usually they roost at Bellagio or Wynn but this time they booked Palazzo. Check-in went well and the room was very nice. Bathroom on the right when you enter followed by the bedroom and sunken living room--complete with sectional couch and hassock. The window offered full views of the Wynn's golf course, as well as the city and mountains to the east. It was nice sitting there at sunset sipping cocktails, watching as the shadows of Wynn and Encore crept across dark green fairways. The pool area at Palazzo was okay, plenty of swimming holes but none very large or inviting. It was all kind of cramped and loud. Not my style nor that of my parents. They liked the room and location, however; yet I'm unsure whether they will room here again. As for me, I would not book a summer stay-cation here. The pools just left much to be desired.
Good hotel for Batchlorette parties. The suits are nice, the extra room when sharing a room with four girls is a luxury.
This is a great place.  The casino is well maintained.  The sports book is awesome!  They have a lot of shops and stuff to see.
This is similar to The Venetian. I think a few square feet bigger but I honestly did not really notice that difference.  Mildly different decor but floor plan is the same. We did get a suite with a view of the pool so that was a bonus.
LOVE LOVE LOVE The Palazzo. I stayed here from a Saturday-Tuesday and had an amazing time! MY boss took us to Las Vegas and since he is a high roller we were living in the laps of luxury for the weekend. When we arrived at the airport there was a driver and a limo waiting for us. Upon our arrival at the hotel we were stunned at how beautiful the lobby was. There were huge fake flowers that were so pretty (not tacky) that lit up the entire space. . . The lobby was hustling with many people (bachelorette parties, couples, and groups of friends/family.) Everyone seemed to be having a good time and it perked me up immediately.  It didn't think it could get any better until we headed to our rooms.....but it did!!. . When we put the key in the door and it opened our jaws dropped to the floor. The first thing I noticed was the great view of Treasure Island from my window. It was a huge room with 2 comfortable queen beds and a sitting area that was located a couple steps down from the beds. The bathroom was INCREDIBLE! There was a glass shower and a nice big tub, on the other side of this huge bathroom was a makeup table/vanity with a lighted mirror. Then there was a huge counter with double sinks but I was wondering where the toilet was. To my surprise, there was a water closet that was separate from the rest of the bathroom. This was great because if you are sharing space with friends and family they can get ready while you use the bathroom. Also, there was a TV in the there! The bathroom had double doors....DOUBLE DOORS!! . . The seating area had a pull out couch and a TV. The queen beds also had another TV which was awesome. 3 TV's in one room??Not really necessary but AWESOME! There was also a lot of closet and drawer space if you need to stow your clothes and belongings. . . I would 100% stay there again...and again and again! If you want luxury, then stay at The Palazzo! It is a short walk from the busy part of the strip (Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, and Caesar's and Bally's) but, its not a far walk.
This place is incredible. Amazing suites (all rooms are suites & get bigger), with 3 flat screen TV's, comfy king size bed, sectional sofa, desk with printer and a small table with 3 chairs. The bathroom has double sinks, bathtub, walk in shower and a vanity for doing hair & makeup and my favorite a toilet in a separate room. The staff is sooooo nice and very helpful, getting around, in & outside the hotel. The casino is one of the nicer ones (IMHO) because the ceiling is a little higher and the smoke rises and isn't as bothersome. The Grand Canal Shoppes are just that GRAND! Very high end shops but fun to look in! The restaurants are incredible with different price points for every budget (food court in Venetian). Need a rental car? Head down to the taxi stand and book one with Avis, book directly there at the counter, it's the best price. Great convenience for getting off the strip. The pool is perfect for me. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles when it comes to pools, comfy, padded chairs with waitress/waiter service, music, towels provided, bar & restaurant in the pool area. What more could a girl ask for? Oh yeah, a lounge chair in the pool on a hot day, yes, in the pool! Awesome! I can't rate the spa, cause I've never tried it, but I'm sure it's as top notch as this hotel!  If you can afford to stay here, do, it's truly worth it!!!
The Palazzo and Venetian are some of the nicer hotel options on the strip but my most recent experience was disappointing.. . Fianace and I decided to splurge and upgrade to the Fortuna suite.  Let me describe how NOT worthwhile this upgrade is.  The normal suites are beautiful and make good use of the space.  For the Fortuna,  you pay approx $100 more for two more chairs.  That's all they've done with the extra square footage. The bathroom is exactly the same, the living room is exactly the same, they just put a bed around a corner and we had more floor space to throw our clothes. NOT worth it.. . They also neglected to give us our coupons during checkin - which I didn't figure out until the morning of checkout when I couldn't get my free coffee.  The checkout employee wasn't unkind about my experience but also offered no reprieve.
This hotel is truly unbelievable, and stands far above the rest (both literally and metaphorically).  It is a behemoth of a building; impressive both outside and in.  If you are looking for pure luxury in Vegas, this is where you should be.. . Without a doubt the Palazzo is the nicest resort in Las Vegas.  The attention to every little detail is amazing.  This resort has definitely earned each of it's 5 diamonds.  The service provided here is impeccable.  Every staff member you encounter is extremely friendly and professional, and you can tell they pride themselves on making your stay as great as possible.  If you ask, they will provide.. . The rooms are also incredible.  This is an all-suite resort so even the smallest room is almost double the size of any other standard room in Vegas.  I was fortunate enough to stay in a Siena Suite with a strip view.  Absolutely breathtaking.  Plenty of room to relax and entertain guests.  . . One of the most impressive things about this resort is the fact that you don't need to leave for anything (this could be a problem depending how you look at it).  There are a ton of restaurants, bars, shops, activities, shows, pools, casinos, etc. all on site.  If you didn't want to leave, you wouldn't have to.  I stayed there for 7 nights and I still didn't get bored of the place.  I wasn't thrilled by the casino though, probably because it wasn't that busy and the dealers weren't the friendliest, but the casino next-door at the Venetian is fun.. . And as far as restaurants, I would recommend TAO if you're looking for a "cool" dining experience, CUT if you're looking for an expensive upscale dinner, and the Grand Lux Cafe for all other dining needs.  Grand Lux Cafe is essentially a Cheesecake Factory, and has great breakfast and burgers (among many other things) for very reasonable prices.  I would highly recommend it. . . All things considered, the Palazzo is an amazing place.  If you are trying to decide where to stay, look no further.  I know that next time I'm in Vegas I wouldn't even entertain the thought of staying anywhere else.  They treat IHG Royal Ambassadors very well, and I'm very much looking forward to my next trip.
Over priced and condescending staff; pool shut down 4:00 to accommodate a private convention; every restaurant way overpriced; Food Network chefs over rated - hoping they get large endorsement fees Cut, Lagasse Stadium, Morels - all overrated!. . Also, no coffee pots in the room - c'mon!!!. . The SMOKE is the worse - in this day and age go smoke free and put the smokers in their own area and scrub their AIR!. . Thank you for other choices in the area!
The suites at Palazzo are absolutely stunning! Stayed here on our vegas trip this past weekend and it was so relaxing. The rooms are really clean and the beds are very plush. It's very classy and the amenities they provided had everything you'd need. All the amenities are in this little box which include ear swabs, nail filer, sewing kit, shower cap, etc. They also include bath robes and slippers! The shower and bath tub are separate, I actually liked the shower more because of the back massage built in it. Such a great feature to use especially after a long day/night of partying. I also liked the double sinks and the hair blow dryer was actually strong, not like the weak ones you'd find at cheaper hotels. The suites in here are huge, the living room has 3 tables, a pullout sofa bed, and fax/printer. The automatic blinds were also a nice touch. I would have to say this is one of my favorite hotels, better than the room at The Wynn.. . We had a great view of the pools (I believe there were 7 pools at this casino). We also paid extra for access to The Prestige room in the Palazzo. It was so awesome! Basically you can skip the buffet line and just grab food at The Prestige to bring back to your room. Breakfast had lots of items like boiled eggs, oatmeal, fruits, assorted pastries, coffee, scrambled eggs, bacon, etc etc. they also serve many different items for lunch & dinner. The Prestige is a huge room and really fancy, you're not allowed in if not properly dressed.. . The casino floor isn't that great here and not as lively as other casinos, but there are plenty of shops & restaurants in the hotel. Just like the Bellagio, they have an area where they decorate with different holiday/seasonal themes and it's really pretty.
Perfect location and perfect experience.  I am a Ambassador Member for Intercontinental and was happy to find out that they are on the list.  The VIP check in was more than expected.  I opted to upgrade to the Siena suite and was happy I did so.  Beds are comfortable and the late 4pm checkout was perfect for our flight back home.  The only thing would be more space for the pools but other than that I will be returning.
I like this hotel. It's still holding up with clean and big rooms! Our suite had a great view and lots of space. There's a bunch of different places to eat inside and it's connected to the Venetian. The casino is also downstairs so no long walks required.. . They had a lot of pools, but no Adult pool, which was a minus in Vegas. There was a small beach club, but you couldn't really relax there. . . The lobby was great and hits you with a beautiful waterfall from the minute you enter. . . I would come back here especially with a large group!
Everything about this hotel (with the exception of smoking areas) was outstanding.. Our suite was beautiful, the staff accommodating and friendly and the location was perfect for walking along the Strip.. We enjoyed the mall between this hotel and the Venetian and ate in several of the restaurants.
Pretty great hotel. I'll break it down for you.. . +1 star: Fast check-in. No hassle. Got upgraded to a room with a view. . . +1 star: Hotel is pretty clean. Lots of new slots. The hotel layout is pretty straight forward (Just follow the arrows and you won't get lost). Room was pretty spacious. We got the double queen suite (Bella Suite with a view 39th floor). Very clean room. . . +1 star: In suite dining (lunch) was surprisingly good. Ordered the Lamb shank with whipped mashed potatoes and vegetables. We also got the Reuben sandwich with onion rings (you can get fruit or fries). The clam chowder and the french onion soup for superb. Cheese pizza for the kids. And Double Chocolate cake for dessert.  . . +1 star: Very friendly staff. They always greet you. . . -1 star: POOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dear Palazzo. You have 6 (I believe) beautiful pools and none of them are kid friendly. Mostly adults (I completely understand ITS LAS VEGAS) but it was so awkward to go to a pool and seeing adults drinking. At least designate one (1) pool for the kids. . . I truly loved my stay at The Palazzo. If it was me and my husband only I'm pretty sure this review will be 5 stars. But I always factor in my children feedback. They enjoyed the tub, but its not the same.. . Till then Palazzo. With your lovely Grand Canal Shopping.
If you have a group, get the suite. It has 2 queen beds, a walk in shower, a bath tub, a separate toilet (closed door), 2 sinks, a roll out bed (fits 2) and another side couch so 7 people can sleep comfortably.. . For $300 a night split between 7 people, pretty good deal.
This hotel knocked our socks off!  The service was impeccable and the rooms were huge and clean.  We felt like royalty.  Its in a great location, has a casino and it is  connected to the Venetian that has a neat indoor shopping mall with a Venice theme.  We went right before Christmas so they had cool shows at night and elves offered hot cider when you entered or left the lobby.  The doormen were courteous and they would your taxi door everytime.  No other hotel did that.  You can get good deals from vegas.com if you go in Dec.  The weather was 60s to 70s.  We will not stay anywhere else and we have told everyone to stay here when they visit. Keep it up Palazzo!
Great place.  Be sure to visit the Fusion Bar on a Friday or Saturday afternoon.  the bartender Wendy makes some of the most fantastic drink combinations ever.
The Palazzo's room design is like the Venetian,  but has its own separate identity. The hotel corridors are even stylish. The conceirge lounge has an awesome view and a great relaxing vibe when having hors dourves and evening cocktails. The casino is more quaint than the Venetian, but definitely nothing you could replicate.
In all honesty, I probably won't stay here again.. . My gf's and I came to Vegas to celebrate my bday.  My first impressionwas that the room was quite comfortable and lovely.  However, I found security to be too aggressive to women, especially women guests at this hotel.. . We had an agenda to go out over the weekend and to see all the big dj's from the pool to the nightlife and we had a fabulous time.  However, this was soured when security is aggressively chasing you to the elevator asking you to flash your key again because they didn't see yours as you showed it walking by.  And it was further soured one night after going dancing at a night club when my gf sat down to a slot machine alone to gamble.  She had 6 huge security aggressively surround her, talk shit to her, demand her key, grill her like a fucking criminal and then humiliate her when she did nothing wrong.  When they realized her name was on the room and she was a guest, they backed off with no apology.  It was humiliating and rude to treat a female guest like that, one whom you should've seen around the hotel all weekend. . . All in all, the security here needs a serious lesson in customer service. As a result, I won't be spending my money here again.
I love this place, after staying at most hotels on the strip outside of those at city center, this has become my go to resort. I always stay on the prestige floor, for the slight higher price its well worth the upgrade. Awesome breakfast and full open bar with appetizers at night included... wonderful!
The Palazzo/Venetian is supposed to be almost on par with the Wynn/Encore in Las Vegas.  However, if you think they are even in the same category, you are sorely mistaken, myfriend.  It's ok, I made this mistake as well.  I was tasked with planning a vacation for a group of friends, and we had a few poor people in the group, so I picked the Palazzo over the Encore because it was about $130 cheaper a night.  When I opened the door to my room, there were stains on the headboard area of the bed.  The marble separator between the bedroom and living area had stains that could not be washed out as well.  The walls were scuffed somewhat badly.  . When we arrived, we did not receive our baggage for almost an hour.  We realized that this was because they gave us a ticket and did not tell us that we had to call the front desk and tell them the number on the ticket before they'd bring it to our room.. When we asked for a humidifier, they gave us a broken one.  When we asked to get it fixed, the service man told us that they all were like that (implying that we didn't know how to use it).  We left it on overnight, and the water level did not go down at all.  The next day, they admitted it was broken and we got another one that worked.   . When we asked for champagne flutes, they did not have any.  Only wine glasses -- and again, it took almost an hour to get them.  We had to call twice to get them because we asked for 8 and they said we could only order 4 per room.  We had to call them the second time to tell them that we had 2 rooms (which should have been obvious since they were both under the same name).  . Worst of all, the showers did not always have hot water.  After a long and dirty night of nightclubbing, we came back to take cold or barely lukewarm showers.  I imagine this is what Sheldon Adelson enjoys doing.  I did this for 3 nights in a row.. One of my friends enjoyed a rib eye at the Grand Lux in the Venetian.  He had diarrhea attacks all day the next day and had chills as he was shivering on the toilet.  I was deterred from using the toilet the next day, as he had laid uneven splatters of excrement on the back of the seat.  I had to use the toilet in our other adjacent room.  . Lastly, the beds were beds for short people.  If you are anywhere near 6ft tall, your feet will hang over the edges uncomfortably.  I would recommend this hotel if you are a poor midget.  Overall, I got the impression that Mr. Adelson had let his American properties wane in order to focus on the real moneymaking Asian properties -- something that I would believe Steve Wynn (Weinberg) would never do.
Beautiful but an absolute maze.  I'm local so didn't stay, just went to shop/dine and have to say it was frustrating.  I liked the shops (did both Venetian and Palazzo) but the "hard sell" of the cosmetics people was like being in Tijuana ... exhausted by merchants.. . Still, if you have comfortable shoes and want to shop and wander for hours, this is a good place.  Just remember where you parked!. . Fyi  "You are here" is not marked on most of the maps and when it was, it was wrong!
