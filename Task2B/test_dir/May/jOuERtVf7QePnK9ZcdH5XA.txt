I would give 0 stars if I was able to. Terrible service, it has taken 45 mins for our group to even get our order.
The Cheesecake Factory owns this cafe.  The food is always good and the prices are what you would expect.  They are open 24/7.  The wait staff is nice.
Affordable lunch or dinner conveniently located within the Venetian. . As others have said, this is very much like a cheesecake factory. Huge menu, reasonably price, and very good food. The nice thing is that they aren't price gouging (as they easily could) considering its location within the Venetian.. . Service was excellent. Our waitress was extremely attentive providing refills, more bread, and the check promptly. She was also very friendly and provided a lot of options that were recommended by her and frequently by guests. . . I ordered the caramel chicken which came with a large portion of rice. This was a massive portion and I could only eat half of it even though I was very hungry. The chicken was very good and nice and crispy. Very similar to an orange chicken from a chain restaurant but a bit sweeter and overall tasted better.. . Overall, great restaurant.. large portions, great service, and affordable.
Open 24/7 so that's a plus! Very similar atmosphere and menu as The Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and it came out to be about $20 including tip. The sauce was really creamy and the chicken was cooked well! Portions are also really big. I was able to share it.
Have been here for lunch and dinner and wasn't thoroughly impressed. But we went for breakfast the last time we stayed at the Venetian, and I was floored by the chicken and waffles! The best I've had in a long time.
Grand Lux used to be the place I ordered from while at the poker table late at night with a few drinks in me. Well, tonight I went there sober and actually ate at the restaurant. . . Food is top notch and reasonably priced. Spring roll appetizer, recommended by out wonderful waitress Deborah, was delicious. Kobe burger was a very good burger and reasonably priced (for Vegas) at $14. . . Will definitely go back
This is my best kept secret in Vegas. I've been coming here for like 15 years and never been disappointed. This is the Cheesecake Factory ( same menu, same cheese cake ) without the glitz and glam and wait time. Open 24 hours, you can eat good food whenever. Garlic Shrimp Scampi and all the burgers are my fave. Pastas and Chicken Madeira are just like the Cheesecake Factory.
Waited too long then when they seated us.. The table was not completely ready. . . Highly recommend the Chicken Lemon Picatta & Bistro steak  ( less than $18 ea ) .. With strawberry lemonade. It was yummy indeed! The first server was not very pleasant ( female w accent/ blonde ) but the second one - ( shift change ) was absolutely delightful..( Pier - i think he was french ).. Kids menu are priced right ($8 below, around there ).
Very disappointing! I have been here before and it was always good.. This time the server was very rude and gave us attitude the entire evening. Out of 7 dishes to come out 3 were cold. The burger was cold and 2 steak sandwiches were almost freezing.. The manager have us a desert for free, but honestly that did not make us feel any better about the meal.. I will have to think hard before I come here again.
Really great little place to grab lunch and take a seat for a little. There lunch specials are really good and great prices. Best part they run their lunch specials until 5. the Servers were kind of slow and hard to be found but that's it.
Excellent breakfast. we ordered the waffle, eggs benedicts and veggie omlette. The waffle is the BEST waffle I've ever had. Fluffy and crispy. The eggs benedict is just ok. The decor and service was very good.
We ate here before going to see Terry  Fator across the street in the Mirage.We were very happy with the service the food and especially the prices,considering this place is in The Venetian.Considering you are in Vegas and prices are high,give a visit to this place you will be surprised at how affordable it can be with great quality.
I always stay at the Palazzo hotel and normally we only did breakfast at the Grand Lux but this trip we ate all of our meals here and everything was GREAT!!!!!. . Breakfast....Try the banana, pecan, caramel topped pancakes. DELICIOUS!!. Lunch.....Asian Short Rib Tacos. DELICIOUS!!!. Dinner or Lunch (We ate light) ....Grand Lux Turkey Burger. The sauce? AMAZING!!!!. . We ate and drank until we were stuffed and all of the meals and service was outstanding.. . Thank you Grand Lux staff and Chefs for a familiar place to eat whenever I am in Vegas.
Seriously delicious!  . . My husband and I were staying at Treasure Island during a brief staycation away from the kids.  We knew we didn't want to eat at the cafe inside of T.I. because $15 for a plate of eggs is NOT okay.  I quickly Yelped somewhere for an early lunch and came across this place.  Since it's right across the street from T.I., we walked on over.. . When we got there, I saw a line out the door and felt instantly defeated.  To my surprise, the line moved insanely fast and we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving.  The place is MASSIVE and it was packed.  Our server was sweet and competent and took our order promptly.. . The food was amazing!  As an appetizer, we ordered a blue cheese salad-- lettuce coated with delicious blue cheese dressing, sprinkled with chunks of blue cheese, thick chunks of bacon, fresh croutons, and tomatoes.  To this day it remains the #1 salad we've ever eaten.  For our main courses, we had meatballs served on polenta and some kind of shrimp dish; both were perfect.  The price was extremely fair-- I'm sure each dish was right around what T.I.'s plate of eggs would have cost us, but obviously the food was above and beyond.. . We had HAD plans to hit up several different Vegas eateries during our stay, but canceled those plans and ate at the Grand Lux for the rest of our meals-- dinner that same night and breakfast the next morning.  We talk about this place ALL OF THE TIME and can't wait to go back with our friends!. . P.S. We HATE the Cheesecake Factory, so don't let their association deter you. =)
This restaurant is awesome!  We couldn't figure out where to eat, and decided to give this place atry.  This is one of the decently priced restaurants in the venetian.  . . I had the mediterrainean mahi mahi. So filling and absolutely delicious.   My husband had the filet with carrots.  Wow!!  An amazing filet for 30$ on the strip!!  . . Seriously cannot say enough good things about this place.  The ladies sitting at the table next to us had fantastic things to say about it too!!. . We will be back several times....for sure!  Way to go Grand Luxe Cafe!!
Great portion size. The menu is huge so it takes a little bit of time to decide what you want. The shrimp are HUGE! Totally a must go for anyone who has never been!
This is one of my favourite restaurants in Vegas! It has an amazing and wide-spread selection that suites any pallet. The service is always superb and the food is fabulous. The only downside is that it is quite crowded and you often have to sit literally right next to another group of people. Don't let this deter you though, it's a worthwhile stop!
This was my second time eating at Grand Luxe Cafe.  First time was with family, and there was something for everyone.  Sister to Cheesecake Factory, so portions huge and freshly prepared.  This time there were two of us catching a bite before a show at the Venetian.  Happened to be happy hour, so we sat at a booth at the bar.  A decent selection of well mixed/prepared cocktails and appetizers for $5 each.  Thai nachos were delicious.  Portions huge for $5.  We split a "small" caesar salad, which was anything but small.  Also split pasta carbonara from the dinner menu which was also very tasty.  . . Perfect for a casual meal of fresh, flavorful food in Vegas.
We come here almost every time we are in Vegas.  It's great for lunch and dinner, but the breakfast is what keeps us coming back. The buffet has good, fresh food at a nice price point.  And the fresh squeezed OJ is to die for! You won't regret it :)
The best faux pho ever! It's called "zen noodles" and it's pretty much pho but none of that unhealthy msg or oil. The broth is similar but very light and more of a lemon grass flavor... it's soooo good! Especially if you've been drinking all night and just want some homey pho...the zen noodles does the trick. You don't even need sriracha sauce or anything to make it flavorful. . . I had it 3 times here, after each night of drinking! It did save a hang over every day. Sooo good!
Cathleen just brought me some warm water when I thought she wasn't ... Pretty excellent service IMHO will come back again
Pretty good for a Vegas breakfast joint! Had to wait in line, but not too long. The menu us HUGE! We tried eggs, potato hash, creamy spinach and cheese dip(my favorite), seared rare ahi, avocado and heirloom tomato salad, and grand club sandwich. . . The creamy spinach dip was the best and so was the grand club sandwich. Breakfast eggs were great too. . . I didn't like the seared rare ahi. It was wasn't very fresh. I guess that's what you get for ordering sushi in Vegas at a breakfast place!. . The salad was refreshing just make sure you like the dressing so best to request it on the side!. . I liked that there were lots of options for everyone. Breakfast ends at 11!
Excellent food w great friendly service.  You cannot beat the value.  It's beautiful inside, the dining feels casual enough though that you don't feel intimidated or underdressed.  They're open so late and the late night menu is very diverse! . Thai chicken/shrimp spring rolls were amazing w fresh mint, carrots and butter lettuce to wrap them in.  Dipping sauce was crack!  . House salad was big, good dressing.  The calamari was very nice, big portion.  We're definitely come back!  Can't wait to try the burgers and chicken/waffles!  Ooo
Awesome breakfast buffet. Why pay $15 for an omelette when you can pay $18.95 for as many omelette as you want? Fruit, eggs, bacon, sausage, ham...you can have it all!. . Also came here for dinner and it was very good as well. The salads are huge! I had to take it to go and would have loved to have eaten it after my night out if my friend hadn't knocked it all over the floor.. Ugh. So sad. . . Our waiter was cute too. And he knew it. Haha. Would def come back again.
So far my favorite place I have eaten in Vegas. Cozy, casual, & clean environment with an eclectic menu. Grand Luxe offers a menu that is fresh & affordable that will even satisfy a wide range of tastes. The service has always been fast & efficient when I have dined here & I am looking forward to eating here later this week.
5 stars for food considering portions and prices.. . -4 stars for the horrid service. Been here 3 times, all 3 times it's taken 25 minutes for the server to take the order and another 35 minutes for food. Then it's another 30 minutes to track your server down to get the bill. I've seen every table complain and the manager come to apologize and tell us they're understaffed. 1st time was ok but the next 2 times (different times of the year) doesn't make sense.
I wish there was another casual choice for breakfast in the Venetian/Palazzo Hotels. While the Cafe is good, it is usually busy and when I'm in Vegas I want to experience something I can't find at home, so I try to avoid the chains. They don't have a buffet, so breakfast is either Gand Lux or one of the upscale restaurants.
This place is undoubtedly one of the best restaurants on the Strip. I can't recommend this place more. My family and I ordered Parmesan chicken, caramel crispy chicken, ribs, pan seared salmon, and volcano shrimp. All of the choices were fantastic. You can't beat the price for the quality and quantity of food at this establishment either. I also highly recommend the drinks-- the Hawaiian smoothie it's to die for. . . The server is the best I've met during my whole 5 day trip to Vegas. He wasn't hovering but he was always there for a water refills or simply to ask how things were going. He was really friendly!. . The ambience is great, the lighting and decor was cozy. Some might say the music is a little too loud at times, but I didn't find it that disturbing. I was sold the moment they started playing Coldplay. :). . Tl;dr: If you're in the area, definitely consider eating here. You'll be missing out if you don't!
A place that is open 24 hours in Vegas! Woohoo! Came here for their pasta. They give huge portions that will totally fill you up in no time. Service average considering I came here at like 4am. But hey, if you can still get some decent food at that time, that's all that matters to me.
We went for breakfast and it was really good! At first, we were just going to order off the menu instead of going to the small buffet, but when you add your beverages, the price is virtually the same. The buffet includes your drinks and an orange juice was $5.95 so we decided to go with the buffet. Small but mighty, it did not disappoint! Made to order omelettes, incredible waffles, a big selection of fresh fruit and pastries, and 3 different kinds of hearty breakfast meat! It was seriously so good for standard breakfast food! Yes it was slightly pricey but it was more than average and great service!
This place reminded me of a glorified version of The Cheesecake Factory. Came here for an early dinner and then again around 4am for some after the club grub. We stayed at The Venetian so that was our biggest deciding factor on going here. Otherwise, I don't think this place would warrant traveling to another hotel for. They do get props for being open 24 hours though. I heard their breakfast is where its at, but I don't remember the last time I woke up during breakfast time in Vegas.
So staying in the Venetian my friends and I decided to have a real meal to soak up some of that binge drinking... Shouldve went somewhere else. It took 10 minutes for five of us to be seated but that was the only thing that was quick. It was extremely hard to find the server for anything he barely came around. N I was not impressed by the food. I had the fish of the day and it was bland n bc the scales weren't removed it left a weird taste in my mouth. My friends broccoli was cold and the brown rice was like concrete pebbles. There was just nothing exceptional, everything was merely edible . . I guess it looks nice in there and the price is right
Its an elevated Dennys. Menu is huge. Always make my way here after drinking lots of booze. Good for the drunken stomach.
