This show is by far one of the best in vegas! You get the best of both worlds: an intimate Cirque show with a raunchy comedy show! I was laughing so much my cheeks were hurting! It's definitely not for those who are easily offended and its definitely not a show for kids because of the language and content of the show. Everything was fantastic about this! To get a real thrill, sit in the front!
ENJOYED THE SHOW!!!. . Went on a whim not really knowing what to expect. Had heard it was "raunchy". We found it very entertaining! A bit raunchy at times but not as bad as we expected. We are in our 50's and were not offended even though my wife is a bit of a prude (and a minority!)! We sat in the back section on wooden bench seats but found the view perfectly fine. In fact all of the seats nearer the stage were small wooden folding chairs and seemed very cramped in comparison.
I don't go to Vegas for the cheap drinks and boobs ( who Am I kidding, I do want cheap drinks and compare those stripper's boobs with mine), but if there's one thing I love doing in Vegas is watching to as many performances and shows as I can. . . This one is OUTSTANDING! . . I had so much fun and was very drawn to every single minute of the performance.  Totally recommend!  FUN FUN FUN.
Soooooo funnny!  you have to watch it.
Went on a date last night to see Absinthe and it definitely did not disappoint. Pretty much the best show I've seen in Vegas. It was raunchy, crude, and hilarious! Do not go see it if you are easily offended, jokes are made about pretty much everything- race, politics, sexuality, etc. . . The tent is small so pretty much anywhere you sit you can see everything. The seats are very intimate so expect to be shoulder-to-shoulder with who you are with. There were elevated tables and those seem to be your best bet. . .  The acts were amazing- my favorite was the roller skating couple. Blew my mind. . . Overall, would definitely recommend to anyone who's looking for a good laugh! I would not think twice of coming to see it again given the chance.
Impressive acrobatic acts. A little bit of cabaret-style music sung by a near-topless pretty girl. Crazy athletic performers who can showcase amazing balancing/strength acts. And the most entertaining, a host & hostess who isn't afraid to say any raunchy, racial, sexual remarks, mixed with a whole lot of profanity. What's the result? A most hilariously weird & crazy show I've seen. I giggle just thinking about it again!. . I've seen this show twice. I think it was even funnier the second time around. I nearly had a heart attack because I though the host was calling me up on stage when it was time for audience participation. I would've died if I had to, yet I loved watching it. . . You can buy tickets through their website. There's not many deals I've found, even as a local. I even remember thinking the first time how the seats were terrible. The view of the show is fine, but the seats are all mismatched wooden ones, definitely not the most comfortable. But was it worth the money? Yes. No question. . . Please see this show knowing what you're getting into. They get dangerously close to the line of being very offensive and obnoxious, so it's not for everyone. People have to realize it's part of the show. Just don't go with your sweet grandmother or your parents. It'll be awkward!. . Use the restroom before the show. Not because it's long, but because it's so funny, you might pee a little from laughing. You leave with your sides hurting a bit. It's definitely a show I'll go to again and again. . . Tip: If Caesars main valet is full, try the valet next to Joe's Prime Steak & Stone Crabs. It's not as crowded & a shorter walk to the show than self-park or the Forum Shops valet.
Absinthe was a big disappointment. The show felt as though it was written by a thirteen-year-old with Tourette's. While three of the numerous acts vaguely referenced alcohol in general (primarily through props), there was no overarching narrative, or anything remotely approaching structure. . . The show consists of a series of acrobatic routines set to music, broken regularly by unrelated and unnecessarily vulgar stand-up bits involving jokes directed at the lowest common denominator. The humor, which other reviewers have praised for its lack of censor, is not brave, edgy or insightful; the jokes don't make any social statements, they're simply vulgar and vitriolic for the sole purpose of shock value. One in three jokes were no more sophisticated than fart jokes, only with more racist and discriminatory undertones. It's bad Burlesque.. . Over the course of the show, there are a handful of jokes and one routine which are genuinely funny, but they don't make up for the rest of the performance. While the acrobatic acts are actually rather impressive, they don't begin to compare to those of Cirque Du Soleil. The musical numbers weren't bad either, but they are few and far between, and it can be difficult to make out the lyrics from the 'VIP' section.. . Considering the myriad alternatives for live entertainment in Vegas, I would not recommend this show to anyone. If you want to watch something that is truly impressive on its own merit, and which doesn't try to buy cheap laughs with foul language, see any one of the many Cirque shows in town.
Personally, I'd give this show 3 stars for the price you pay but since my guests liked it so much I upgraded it to 4. If you're looking for a more risque show with acrobatic stunts and some comedy mixed in, then this is it. I just felt like I paid $100 to go to a circus event where people were overexcited to be there in the first place.  Plus, I was seated behind people that had the longest torsos on Earth...which made seeing the show a little harder. Since it is in a small round tent with a round stage, there shouldn't be a bad seat in the house, but the first 9-11 rows aren't raised up very much from each other, so if you aren't the tallest chick in the building you may be outta luck.
Hands down the best show in Vegas.  Mind blowing stunts, hilarious comedians, and all around great experience. Don't sit up front unless you want to participate. If you have to see one show in Vegas spend the money and see this one.
For the 4th time Absinthe in Vegas show still makes me laugh. It's wildly entertaining with the raunchy dialogue of who knows what they are going to say next. They have changed some of the acts since I saw it last year. I still am impressed by the rollar skate duo as the speed and small stage make me nervous of the thought that he if let go this poor girl would be flying into us. A new act of two girl acrobatics in a kinda lesbo duo is cool- not into the lesbo thing but I can't believe the strong woman can flip the smaller girl around in the air like that. Wow! I love the two bodyguards - glad they didn't cut that from the show! These two guys are like greek god statues and they move in the most graceful way changing formations. Well- you could just have them the entire show and I could watch them all night. . Next time in Vegas I want to see the new show- Vegas Nocturnal by the creators of Absinthe. If you want to laugh and aren't shocked by profanity and sexual humor come to this show. Oh and they have Chandon splits for $10 better than Fizz at $12. . Sometimes there is a guy during the day handing out coupons for the show. . The seats are still uncomfortable. Was it my imagination or did they shorten the length of the show? It always seems to end too soon.
Big disappointment!  The tent from the outside looks fun and inviting.  You walk in and it's this great ambiance of funky, eclectic, and unique.  The seats are tied together with  cord and each chair is different giving it that funky look.  Unfortunately, it is the most uncomfortable chair known to man.  I felt like my ass was assaulted!  And I have some junk in the trunk and still it was painful.  Thank god the show is only 90 minutes.  . I've seen other shows similar to this......Teatro Zinzanni in Seattle and San Fran, some shows in Europe in similar tents.  This comes with no food and is a shorter show.   It comes with the prerequisite cirque style acrobatics all of which I thought were mediocre.  It was like they were walking thru the paces and not truly into it.  Two girls pretending to be lesbians in a trapeze act that was so half assed and unbelievable.  No one was buying their relationship.  Not even them.  It looked like a director said "put your hand here and then touch her there"  So stilted and forced.  Another act of hand balancing from a couple of guys from Poland.  They obviously have athletic ability but besides that, no personality, no stage presence of any kind.  Same thing with the Russian acrobats.  If in fact, it's supposed to be just a variety show with one act after another with no connective tissue than it's so/soat best.  Speaking of connective tissue.......there is a man and woman comic team that is supposed to MC the evening.  While I know it's Vegas and anything goes, especially potty and non PC humor, it still needs to be funny.  I'm no prude and am not in anyway offended easily, I still wanted it to be FUNNY.  Just because you can use obscenities until the cows come home and reference masterbation throughout the evening, doesn't it still have to make me laugh?  I didn't.  I kept waiting.  Still no laughter in 90 minutes.  . Music.  Canned music?  No live band?  Over 100 bucks a ticket and no music.  There is a stripper who, and I use this term lightly, sings.  But, she was three pitches off from hitting any correct note.  Give us a kick ass real singer who blows your tent up!!!  . Again, another production from Speigelworld with no content, no impressive talent, and ultimately no payoff in the end.  Great tent, great ambiance but not a great show.. Save your money and your ass and go elsewhere.
if there's going to be one show i'll keep on watching in vegas, it's absinthe. Mr.gazillionaire and dorothy will put on a show that will push the limits between obnoxious, obscene, outrageous and straight out offensive. . it's one of those shows that you can't bring your elderlys to...the board says 18+ only but you should mention the topless cabaret girl, the snowballing homosexual comments, the racial slurs that comes out of this man's mouth, it's hysterical.......be warned, during audience participation, nobody is safe, especially if you happen to be one of the two black guys in the audience, good luck....there's gonna be so much racist jokes, sexist jokes, republican jokes, gay jokes, lesbo jokes, nothing and nobody is safe, next time i go to watch this show, i'm going buzzed!!. . BEST SHOW IN VEGAS EVAR
I took my beautiful girlfriend to see this show last night. After looking all over for cirque tickets at a reasonable price, I "settled" for tickets for this show. I must say that it was the best decision I've made for this trip! We celebrated her milestone birthday with champagne, great performers, and so many laughs with this "gut busting". show. After walking out, we both immediately said that we would go back to see it! Just one warning, just as every other review has stated, it is as raunchy as you can get without being overbearing, so it's not for the shy or prude. We still have 2 days left here in Vegas, and this show is the highlight of our trip, thus far... Bravo Absinthe... Best night ever...
I did NOT realize that this was a 18+ show until I picked up and read the fine print on my ticket .... . WARNING: Please skip the show if you have experience the follow symptoms. . - Can't tolerate stereotypical racist / sexist jokes. - Can't accept profanity / vulgar languages. - Can't handle sexual innuendos. . What made this show worth the money: 1st - seating, seating, and seating! Unlike some other shows where you are literally sitting 100+ feet away from the actual performance, this is a very intimate setting and pretty much any seats can give you a great view. You can get to witness the incredible acrobatics close up in person. . . What to expect: Expect audience participation (15%), ridiculously vulgar (or witty) stand-up comedy (35%), acrobatics / gymnastics (35%), and Melody Sweets' musical performance (15%). . . Yup, this was probably the most vulgar comedy show that I've ever watched (even more so than the Book of Mormon). If you can set your mind free (as one of the Yelper wrote - getting buzzed) and having that  "I don't give a damn" attitude, then this could potentially be one of the best Vegas show experience. . . P.S. - Definitely one of the more expensive show - expect at least $100 per ticket.
AMAZING simply amazing! This is by far the best show I've seen in Vegas! Definitely not for the faint of heart or people that get easily offended (this show has a lot of material that can be offensive to some) but hilarious at the same time. The acrobatic parts are incredible, INCREDIBLE!! I was in awe the entire time!! The venue is also great because it's small an intimate. This is a must see in Vegas. Definitely coming back for more Absinthe the next time in town.
I was seriously disappointed with this show. I suppose I should have read the Yelp reviews before purchasing my ticket, as I expected the show to have 18+ humor but not be tasteless, crass and just plain unfunny. . . The good -- the acrobatic performances are amazing, as good as anything I've seen in any Cirque Du Soleil show. It's a very intimate theater-in-the-round, so there are no bad seats and the action is right in front of you. . . The bad -- The show stops and starts abruptly... there's no flow or overarching theme to the show. There's a Green Fairy character who does a few burlesque acts while singing, but you can barely hear her lyrics and the melody just isn't good. The worst are the two hosts, spouting out sex and race jokes like you're at an open mic in the 1980s. It made me very uncomfortable to sit through old, tired cliche jokes about race. I'm not opposed to jokes of this nature -- but at least be clever about it. I was either rolling my eyes at their "jokes" or seriously turned off. . . And for over $100 a ticket?? I expected to see something with a bit of class or creativity at that price. At least the acrobats were impressive, but if that's your thing, save your money for a Cirque show and skip this.
Great show. Really intimate. If you sit close to the stage, be ready to be the brunt of some jokes. If you are easily offended, save your money.
I saw this show about three months ago after receiving two free vip tickets as a gift from one of my clients. From what I understood, vip gave you free champagne, a different entrance through a green door and a seat in one of the first two rows. . I LOVED this show! But that's because it definitely fits my sense of humor. I could definitely see how some people might get really uncomfortable and quesy feeling. You have to really not be bothered by raunchy  and rascist jokes. Do not bring your parents or kids to this show! That would definitely be awkward!. The acrobatics were really amazing and different! There wasn't a single time I was bored. I also loved how small the theatre was because really every seat has a great view. The closer seats just have more of a risk of being hit in the face! Lol . The only negatives for me was: . 1. The seats are ridiculously small and uncomfortable!  You're basically touching thighs with the person sitting next to you and you can't make more room because the seats are chained together at the legs. . 2. Even though many shows in Vegas  have this aspect, I still hate it. I haaate audience participation!!  I hate trying to avoid eye contact whenever they're looking for a volunteer lmao. And don't think sitting in a back seat keeps you safe! They grabbed a poor girl sitting in the very last row! So if you want to enjoy a show knowing you're 100% safe from embarassment, this one might not be for you! . . Overall, one of my favorite shows, had me dying with laughter! The jokes were on a whole different level, my stomach hurt from all the laughing! I would definitely see it again if there wasn't that audience participation aspect!
