Had the turkey sliders appetizer which were decent but the chopped salad and pan seared scallops were phenomenal! Service and ambiance--excellent. Pricing is average considering the location
It's not all that often I find a restaurant five-star worthy; four star, all the time.. This restaurant fits the bill perfectly. From the location, to the fabulous wrap around bar, to the amazing food, only to be topped by impeccable service and the friendliest restaurant team I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Unfortunately, the restaurant patio was booked and we didn't get to sit outside as I had hoped, but the hostess was kind enough to give us a table just inside the folding doors so we can get our share of sunlight.  Gina and her team couldn't have been more delightful and accommodating.  Make it a point to try their Cobb salad.  The meatloaf was outstanding!  Who knew you could make popcorn and bacon work?   Thank you Lex for taking the time, and for the fantastic brittle.  . Do not miss this gem if you're in the area or passing through. It won't disappoint.
My oh my... I've never been happier to accidentally stumble upon a restaurant. It was one of those dining experiences where everything was perfect from the food to the service. I was debating between this restaurant and Bandera since both have excellent reviews, but I realized there was a Bandera location in Chicago so that helped me make my choice. . . Starting with drinks, I've always wanted to try a Moscow Mule, and at Citizen Public House, all of their drinks have a signature mix to them. I HIGHLY recommend it... it was done way before we received any food :). . Now onto the food... . . I ordered the Pan Seared Scallops with Roasted Corn Grits - it was one of the BEST meals of my life!!!! I've had scallops numerous of times, but these were the most delicious and delicate I've ever tasted. The corn grits were an incredible addition to the scallops as well... just trust me and get them!. . My fiance had the Buttermilk Roasted Chicken - smart Chicken breast, sweet corn-butter bean succotash, roasted Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, pecorino Romano. It's a very popular item and I tried a bit and it was great (not as good as my scallops though). We both practically licked our plates clean... and he's not much of a food lover ;-p. . We were stuffed, so no room for dessert, but I WILL be back when I'm in the area again. Our server, who's name I forgot, was excellent and very helpful. The entire night was amazing and definitely the best dinner of our trip to AZ!
Wow. Words can't describe the chopped salad. It'd the best salad I've ever eayen. I don't eat gluten so I had the couscous on the side but it was still perfect.  I wish I lived in Scottsdale so I could eat it every fay! Our server Gary was very helpful explaining the menu and he swore by the slad...I'm so glad that he recommended it.
Outstanding, lived up to what I've heard. Staff is extremely passionate and knowledgeable about the cuisine and beverage list. Atmosphere can look fancy, but it's not stuffy at all. . . -The Original Chopped Salad is fantastic. I don't entirely agree with the dehydrated corn vs. fresh corn choice, but the dressing has basil in it and completely makes the dish. You get a ton of salad too.. -Crab cake appetizer is good, but underwhelming. Next time I'll get the pork belly pastrami like our server recommended, or the butternut squash gnocchi.. -My friend got the duck with cranberry compote, looked pretty damn good.. -Tulip-git-to-quit drink was meh. Next time, sangria.. -Pb&b pudding dessert is NECESSARY. Did I taste house-made whipped cream?
I have never had a bad meal here....The chopped salad needs no hype from me.. The Scallops are perfection...I love this place....
Another trendy and tastefully decorated hang-out place in old town Scottsdale. CPH is among a handful of new resto-bars in Scottsdale that are transforming the image of the old town neighborhood. The menu is a mix of amazing comfort foods and lighter salads a dishes. Best is to go with a group and try everything! Also have a taste of The Persian cocktail! :-). I would rate this place one of the top 5 restaurants in the city.
I was really pleased with my dining experience here. It's really refreshing to see someone who actually enjoys their job, our server was great, and passionate. He was prompt, gave great suggestions and added to an overall positive experience. Now onto the food, for an appetizer we got the crab cakes, we both enjoyed the flavor but agreed that for the price the portion was a bit small. For dinner I got the scallops and my fiance got the meatloaf. They scallops were very flavorful and cooked to perfection. The meatloaf was very juicy, and had great layers of flavor. Dessert was so-so, we got the peanut butter pudding cup thingy, all the flavors were good I just don't think it catered to my taste. But overall everything was good and we really enjoyed our experience .
Parentals brought yer boy here for bday #29. The wifey and I were early so we sat at the bar. I ordered a Manhattan. That ish was turnt to eleven. Bartender made us feel special. Sparks were flying on the conversational tip and literally as well. There was fire involved with the assembly of my drink. Fire is dope. Ma n Pah arrived so we moved from the bar to our table. The ambiance was sessy in the dining areas. Dim. Candles. Music. Booze. If you are trying to get under some garments then I recommend bringing your date here. Our waiter danced through the menu for us.. highlighting all his favorite items. Dude was like the Fred Astaire of wait staff. His charm worked too cuz my party ordered like everything off the menu. Pork belly. Fondue. Mac n cheese to start. I recommend you not order both the mac n cheese plus fondue because they use the same cheese for both. Good shit none the less. Belly was ill too. Dem brussel sprouts on the belly had me smiling.. the 16 year scotch which I transitioned to probably loosened that grin a bit too. Yum. Mom got ribs. Wife got chicken. Dad got meatloaf. Birthday boy (muah) got the duck. I tried each dish. All were spectacular. The chicken stood out though.. and usually I'm like: fuck ordering chicken at a nice(r) establishment. I remember thinking, "For reals boo? Chicken breast?" But oooh weee was I wrong. Delicious. Bread pudding was sweet to start then finished spicy as a damn Puerto Rican. What a great time!
I had been anticipating a wonderful experience at this restaurant and finally went last weekend with my husband and another couple. Living in the area and traveling frequently, my husband and I eat out at fine restaurants all the time. So this review is based upon years of dining experience throughout our country... WE WOULD NOT RETURN! . The service was the only redeeming feature. The quality and food preparation was subpar and the portions were smaller than usual dinner servings. The appetizers were good but the dinner selections (we had 4 different) were just OK. We were hoping the desserts would be better. Our server recommended her 2 favorites but they were not worth the calories and we left half of each. The noise level was that of a Friday night bar happy hour - we could barely talk to our friends sitting across the table.. Cowboy Ciao has the original menu because the chef started there and then moved to CPH. Skip Citizen Public House and go to Cowboy Ciao, especially if you are visiting and want a wonderful meal in Scottsdale.
My wife and I had a reservation for a Saturday night dinner. When we arrived we were seated immediately on the patio as we requested in our reservation. The service was very professional and attentive. Our server made excellent recommendations what to eat for dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. It was high quality and different from what you find at other restaurants. They also have beer on tap which is great. Overall we had an excellent experience and will return during our next visit to Scottsdale.
Chop salad, fondue, and scallops are my favorites.  Great atmosphere and drinks.  Never had a bad experience and I have been here a bunch!
This place is amazing.  My girlfriend and I came here for an anniversary dinner and we were not disappointed.. . The ambience here is quite nice.  There was a fair amount of space in between tables but it was still very cozy.  Our waiter was excellent and helped to recommend some dishes for us to try.  We started with the chopped salad.  If you haven't tried this, you need to.  It was fantastic.  They bring it out to the table with all of the ingredients lined up separately and then they mix it in front of you.  It was one of the best salads I have ever had.  From there, I had the seared scallops and she had the smoked duck.  Both were outstanding.  The scallops were served medium rare I believe and were very tasty.  The duck was tender andjuicy and had a great flavor.  We also tried some dessert.  We shared the brownie and the one with the pudding and graham crackers.  Both were very good though the brownie was very rich. (I am not sure if they still have these on the menu).. . I had the Manhattan listed on their cocktail list and it was by far one of the best I have ever had.  So much so that I had 2 of them.  My girlfriend had their cocktail that comes with a sugar/candy rim and rock candy (the Citizen).  They have a great selection of cocktails and beers here.. . The waiter, again, was on point.  I want to say his name was James? Either way, the service was excellent and we will definitely be back.  Expect to easily spend around $100 for two people depending on how hungry you are but I can guarantee it is worth it.  If you have not been here yet, make sure that you find time to do so.
Love this place. Took the mother in law out for her birthday and couldn't have had a better experience. Try the fair trade short ribs. They are fall off the bone tender and the sour cherry BBQ sauce is an incredibly unique flavor. Service is quick and friendly. Lots of fun cocktails to sample. Side wall opens out to the patio- so you can enjoy the fresh air inside when the weather is nice.
Beautiful atmosphere and great service. Unfortunately, the food was not up to the same standards.. . We walked in on a Monday night and the place was largely empty, which worked well for us. We sat outside on the patio, which was well lit and nicely appointed with a great view of the restaurant itself. Our waiter was very friendlyand helpful.. . I ordered the Deep Sea Red Crab Cakes to start, and really admired the flavors. The crab cakes were well cooked, and the red pepper aioli added an unexpected but delicious kick. Unfortunately, there was just far too much aioli on the plate, making it the star of the dish, not the crab itself, as it should have been.. . As it was quite late, I decided to skip an entree and just order another appetizer as my main course. The butternut squash gnocchi with pecan pesto and brown sugar sauce sounded amazing, but it was probably the worst thing I have ever eaten in a restaurant. The gnocchi seemed to have been deep fried, so they lacked that soft, melt-in-your-mouth taste that I love in gnocchi. They were chewy and meaty - in fact, when I passed one to my husband, he asked, "What kind of meat is in this?" The "sauce" was a very light slop that did little to mask the texture of the gnocchi. I actually had to stop eating because I thought I was going to be sick if I put another one of those gnocchi in my mouth.. . Perhaps I just didn't order the right things at Citizen, but I can honestly say I will not be returning for another go.
I don't get it. Was so excited to eat here because of all of the rave reviews but I just flat out don't get it. The service was great but the food was pretty meh. The chopped salad, as I was eating it, the whole time I was comparing it to the SAME EXACT salad which is served at Cowboy Ciao practically across the street. I have to admit, Cowboy Ciao wins. The tomato in citizen's salad was not fresh, and the salad had a strange texture because I really think they just skimped on the freshness of the ingredients. Aside from that though, why are you serving the same exact thing as a neighboring restaurant and trying to call it your signature dish???!!! One of you has to figure it out and take it off the menu, that's the most ridiculous thing ever. Citizen's tasted fine, but Cowboy Ciao would win on this one.. . We ordered the pork belly pastrami also at yelp's recommendation and were not fans. it tasted like old coffee, it was really strange texture again and just not that great. . . The positives- Scallops were a delicious dish and the pudding jar is amaaaaazing dessert. I wanted to lick the jar of that pudding dish, it was so yummy. . . Basically my experience was just so so, would I recommend it if someone were to ask me where they should eat in old town? No, would I go out of my way to go there again? No, but was it a decent experience? Sure
One of my absolute favorite places in Scottsdale.  I bring guests here all the time.  The first time I ate here was about 2 years ago during Restaurant Week and I wasn't all that impressed.  I'm glad I gave it another shot because every time I've come back I have loved it more and more.. . My personal recommendations are the Pork Belly Pastrami, The Original Chopped Salad (yes it's just like Cowboy Ciao, but it's still really friggen good), and the Beef Belly BLT (oh my gosh is this good...everyone at my table wished they had ordered this after they tried it).. . Recommendations based on friends/family's experiences: Bernie's Mac 'N' Cheese, . Fair Trade Short Ribs, and the Pan Seared Scallops.. . Also, a good tip if come during busy season (spring training) and can't get a reservation until late: come at 7pm when the "secret" upstairs speakeasy opens, and call to get on the list up there.  The drinks are AMAZING and they serve the full CPH menu.
I am a fan of the late night menu which starts at 11pm, has great deals, amazing food and ends at 1:30a! Late night gourmet on the cheap!. . The regular menu is great too! Everything sounds odd when described but tastes like heaven when it arrives!. . First timers: . App: pork belly pastrami or share the original chopped salad. Main: the scallops or the porcini filet
From the moment we walked in we were greeted with smiling faces. Once we sat down we meet our waiter. He truly was an amazing man. Gary was his name. He called us love and treated us like royalty! He helped us order since it was our first time. We had the most amazing cosmopolitan! For apps we had the pork and waffles and it was yummy. Dinner we had the chicken and it was to die for. The food was impressive and very fresh! But most of all, Gary was perfection! All you waiters out there should take note and follow his lead. Lots of love to Gary!!! We will be back!!!
The chef is always cooking up nightly specials, I have eaten here 20 times and its never bad, they got my vote! Oh - and have the chicken and waffles for an appetizer, it's not weird = it's D'Lish!
First, I have to say that our waiter was a real talent.  I thought the menu was more limiting than I would have wished.  My main course was above average.  My desert was below average.  Leading to an overall three stars.  Who knows, on a different night it might be a different experience.  Not yet ready to rule it out or rule it in.
The food was all sub par, especially for the price. I ordered the scallops and nothing ruins scallops like biting into a small shell on your second bite. My girlfriend ordered the grilled cheese and it was one of the worst I've ever tasted. The bread resembled store bought and there was some sort of mashed potato in it. The chocolate cake dessert was good, a little stale, but still good. The drinks were the lone bright spot, disregarding the price. The moscow mule and old fashioned I ordered were pretty spot on. . . All in all this place is not worth the price mainly due to the uninspired and expensive food. I would, however, go grab a drink there. If you are looking for a nice restaurant with a cool ambiance keep looking because you won't find it here
The food at Citizen Public House was some of the best I have had in a long time.  As a gluten free eater I often have to settle, but CPH had some of their best options that were completely gluten free, including two dessert items and neither one was ice cream or creme brulee.   Our server was also incredibly attentive and informative helping us pick great cocktails and providing his recommendations.
First timehere. Actually it's my first time eating in Arizona! Being from LA and eating around there all the time, one can be kind of a food snob when eating outside of your comfort zone. This place does not disappoint. Everything we ordered was on point from the scallops, short ribs, meatloaf,. and their chopped salad.  If you're in Scottsdale, hit this place up. Shout to Brad our server!
We love this place and visit every time we are in town. The food is yummy. Love the original chop salad, the beef short ribs, meatloaf and the lamb burger. . The mixologist is top notch, the service friendly and the vibe welcoming & fun.. A must while in Scottsdale.
$5 HH deals on cocktails! The food was really delicious too. If I lived closer, I would come more. The patio and location cant be beat.
Wow.  Where do I start.  The bar had so many health violations, my salad was warm and limp, the gnocchi tasted like it was fried in grease and my filet wasn't cooked correctly.  So I sent the salad back, gave my gnocchi away and the waiter had the chef fix my filet.  Now mind you, I cut my steak with my fork and knife and when they brought back my filet it was the same one so that means they re-cooked my filet after I cut it with my knife fork and germs...interesting.  Also for the amount of money you pay, the "posh" look, the snobs and wanna be's. ..the waiters need to learn to serve from the left and proper placement of a dinner setting lol.  The steak after the second time, mac n cheese were good but I've had better.  just being honest.
