Ive been here several times and every time it is an amazing experience. The service is fantastic and the food is even better. The steaks are always cooked perfectly and the sides are also amazing. They have a great wine and whisky selection as well. I would recommend this place to anyone.
Get Brianna!!
Really great place! Quality is amazing. Maybe best fish I've ever had. Everything I tasted was delicious:)
Steak restaurants in Las Vegas, like internet cat sites,  exist in a hyper competitive cut throat market. Some places that would be thebomb.com in other markets just can't cut the mustard when compared to Vegas Gold Standards like Carne Vino or Outback. IMHO Craftsteak is just such a restaurant- it is pretty good, but given its similar in cost to just about every steak place on the strip it isn't one I would recommend. . . I always get the same thing first time around- Bone in Ribeye, Potato side, Mac and Cheese- except for they don't have mac and cheese- terrorists win :(. . . The Steak- the bone in ribeye was mediocre at best. Ordered medium rare the meat was barely pink which was a huge misstep. It didn't have a very good crust and was sort of bland- given how often TC yells at people on Top Chef for incorrectly seasoning, and given it was a steak and should have enough salt on it to choke a deer, this was pretty disappointing. Now again, if this was your first Vegas steak experience you could overlook this and still have a pretty good meal. But if you have been to other great steak restaurants in the area these mistakes become more crushing. . . Now I will say- their specialty is clearly the more expensive steaks (US and Australian Wagyu, Kobe... or Japanese Wagyu? Does anyone know what these things mean? Nope? Ok I figured). So I will admit the fault could lie with me not going for a big boy steak. . . Potato Gratin-this was actually pretty top notch. It has a garlic cream sauce that is STRONG so if you are on a date or with a fancy prostitute you may want to stay away.. . White Corn Grits- I'm from the dirty south so naturally I had to order this. It's not exactly what you would expect if you have been raised on three Michelin star restaurants like Waffle House- but it is chock full of so much bacon and gruyere cheese that you can't really go wrong. . . Dessert. The Monkey Bread is pretty amazing- overall the sides and dessert were the stars of this meal with the steak more of a creepy extra lurking in the corner. If I went back here I would probably skip the steak altogether and get more apps/sides/desserts.
I warn you my review may not necessarily represent the main reason you'd come here for: STEAK. So if you're looking to see how that was, I cannot help you with that.. . With that being said, everything I did order was perfection. Their warm bread with just enough sea salt was an epic way to start out the evening.  I began my delicious journey with the avocado appetizer which was to die for. Most of my colleagues regretted their choices (which were delightful themselves) after tasting mine! It was truly that good. Then came my scallops, which were cooked to sheer perfection. We ordered various side dishes for the table , all of which were excellent. I wish I could name them all, but after endless bottles of Pinot Grigio, the night was a tad fuzzy.. . What I do remember crystal clear is what was what I considered "la piece de resistance" of the evening. MONKEY BREAD! I dug into that monkey bread like I was making sweet love to it. I forgot if anyone wanted a piece. Quite honestly, I did not care. It was ooey gooey, crunchy, warm, sweet, decadent, naughty and oh so wicked. It was bliss. Eventually I was forced to pass it around, but I probably ate most of it. . . . I love you, Monkey Bread.
We had literally just eaten at Earl of Sandwich like 2 or 3 hrs ago and nobody was hungry...but I'lll be gawdamned if I'm not gonna grab a steak from one of my favorite bald ass chefs of all time whilst in sin city.. . ASPARAGUS. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tom-colicchios-craftsteak-las-vegas-2?select=RpRac7faUh0xTnh7l6tnwQ#RpRac7faUh0xTnh7l6tnwQ. . This is what $15 worth of weird smelling pee looks like.  It tasted great btw...the asparagus....not my pee.. . HANGAR STEAK. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tom-colicchios-craftsteak-las-vegas-2?select=RpRac7faUh0xTnh7l6tnwQ#ij_QQBzoVZLyi_byXqIxkA. . I went cheap and just got the $36 hangar steak.  I remember thinking...this better be the best damn hangar steak I've ever had in my life....luckily....it was....BUT just a bit overcooked from the medium rare I asked for but still damn good.. . FILET MIGNON. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tom-colicchios-craftsteak-las-vegas-2?select=RpRac7faUh0xTnh7l6tnwQ#NHzK-xRK4EXoORJ0hjf8yQ. . The wife's "go to" cut of meat.

MOOOOOOOOOO.
Butternut squash soup is EXQUISITE! All the food is remarkable, a real treat for your palate. The service is outstanding, and the atmosphere is relaxed. Perfection every visit!
Craftsteak is worth every penny. We didn't have a reservation, and had show tickets afterwards, neither thing was an issue at all. . . We got a table with very little wait, they took our drink order and brought out these delicious fresh from the oven rolls. These rolls, are still piping hot when they get to the table, and they just melt in your mouth. At first bite, I knew things would go well.. . We ordered our meals, and while waiting kept refilling our drinks and bringing us more rolls...I think we were starting to get full just from those amazing rolls. . . Out comes our food. As a group of 3, we decided to order only 2 sides and slipt them between us, the sides are huge and easily fed the three of us. We ordered the asparagus and the potato gratin. Both were delicious.. . For my main I ordered the t-bone steak, that thing filled up my plate, it was huge! Something I definitely was not expecting, most steakhouses give you such a tiny portion. The steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and tender I didn't even use the knife provided to cut it, wasn't needed it was that tender.. . This place is definitely worth a visit.
Definitely a steakhouse that offers to fill you and your friends up with high quality meat and appetizers.. . Its all about quality but not quantity here....so grab your AMEX and get ready to spend on their renditions of steak, potato puree, assorted muchrooms and brussell sprouts!. . Perfect spot for a classy dinner before a night out in vegas.
FOOD. From a recommendation of a friend I went with the NY Strip Bone-in, Dry Aged Roasted Steak. My friend was right. The steak was perfectly cooked, juicy, and flavorful. It had already slid of the bone by the time it reached me. I really wanted to try the wagyu, but I didn't want to have to sell a kidney.. . I also ordered the Fries, which might sound average, but these are soaked in sherry vinegar before frying, and topped with smoked paprika. They're delicious.. . DRINKS. A very good selection of various alcoholic beverages, but my attention went to the Whiskey. They have several smokey whiskeys and scotches and was able to try one that wasn't even on the menu yet, the Audbeg. Smooth, smokey and I wanted more.. . PRICE. Not cheap. Probably the opposite of cheap, but it's Tom Colicchio, so you'd be ignorant to think otherwise.
Once again Craft did not disappoint. There were 4 of us and we did the tasting menu. 4 different steaks with 4 appetizers, 4 sides & 6 desserts. Steaks were cooked perfectly and the waiter couldn't of picked better dishes for us. . . Highly recommend this place!!
My sister and I each pick a new restaurant to try every year in Vegas and highly enjoyed craftsteak.  We didn't do a tasting menu, but each had a bone-in ribeye.  The steaks were done perfectly and I thought had tons of flavor, but I'm a sucker for even a standard ribeye.  We got spinach and fries as sides, which were both delicious.  I'm just starting to like cooked spinach and this was done really simply but well-garlic, salt, and cooked well.  The fries have smoked paprika, which I love and were crispy.
My spouse, a friend, and I dined at Craftsteak while visiting Las Vegas in March 2014. This was on our list of can't-miss restaurants, and I think that overall, they lived up to our expectations. . . We each ordered the same steak entree, each of which was prepared to our preferred level of doneness, which is to be expected at a steakhouse of this caliber. Side dishes were delightful- we shared the white corn grits and the heirloom cauliflower with garlic confit. The staff also kept us well stocked on fresh-baked yeast rolls, which were jaw-droppingly good.. . Cocktails were yummy, but not extraordinary. Atmosphere was lovely and conducive to conversation. My only complaint is that our server did not tell us that sides were family-sized, and so our party ended up over ordering a bit compared to what we would have if we'd been better informed of portions. . . Overall, we had a great time and would recommend Craftsteak to others.
Our group of 8 arrived for our 8:30 reservation and were seated promptly. We all decided to do the domestic wagyu tasting menu ($145/person). Our total bill came to be about $1,500 after tax & tip w/ wine and other drinks included. IT WAS SO TOTALLY WORTH IT! To be honest, my expectations weren't too high for Crafsteak, but I left mindblown (my stomach was goin to explode too LOL). We basically had a feast fit for way more than 8 people. Service and food were excellent!! Overall it was3 courses and for each course, the servers came out with the dishes in symphony.. . They start you off w/ their addicting bread which I regret eating so much of because it filled up my stomach space. The bread comes out hot & fresh in a rectangle cast iron skillet. The butter is sooo good w/ the bread. It's some sort of hawaiian roll w/ sea salt sprinkled on top. So buttery, rich, fluffy, and flavorful w/ a hint of sweetness. We got 2 rounds of bread cause it was so good. . First Course: Salads & apps. Caesar Salad - Unique twist to a classic salad. The romaine lettuces were left full in leaf form rather than cut. The dressing wasn't heavy and the minced anchovies weren't overpowering.. Baby Bibb - the buttermilk blue cheese & bacon complemented the salad very well. Normally my bf & I don't like blue cheese, but the way it was incorporated in this dish made it light and tasty.. Avocado Salad - Light lemon vinaigrette dressing and PLENTY of avocado fans. The avocados were all ripe and smooth as a baby's butt.. . Hand cut Wagyu tartare- I LOVE TARTARE and I totally could have eaten this w/out the crostini. There's also a small raw quail yolk right in the middle of the tartare. I liked eating this app w/ the bread they provided in the beginning. Proscuitto San Daniele - KILL ME. The best proscuitto I've had. Not overly salty and it was delicious w/ the pears. It tasted even better wrapped around the cheese garlic breadsticks provided. Shrimp cocktail - fresh plump shrimp, but it was like any other shrimp cocktail. . Proscuitto Risotto - OMFG the risotto is THE BEST I've ever had. OUT OF THIS WORLD AMAZING. It contained english peas and scallions mixed in. The risotto had that creamy rich texture that just melts in your mouth. I couldn't stop eating this, had to force myself to stop so that I could share it w/ the rest of the table.. . Potato Puree - Yukon GOLD POTATOES!! It was really creamy/smooth. I actually prefer this over Joel Robuchon's mashed potatoes.. . For the vegetables we had asparagus, baby carrots w/ honey, snap peas w/ romesco & shallots, Mushroom assortment, Zucchini w/ maui onions. All of the vegetables were cooked perfectly. My fav were the assorted mushrooms (it included all the mushrooms like shiitake, french horn, etc) & baby carrots. The only bad dish of the night were the french fries. They weren't crispy enough. . 2nd Course: MEATS. We basically had a whole cow on the table. Overall 8 cast iron dishes of diff cuts were laid out at the table. Half cooked medium rare and half medium. Each one had a nice beautiful red warm center w/ the perfect outside sear. . NY strip - normally I don't like NY strip 'cause it's too lean and dry, but the NY strip cut here was my 2nd fav of the meat dishes! It looked lean, but was really juicy and soft yet flavorful. Outside skirt - #1 fav for the table. This was the only plate that was gone at the end of the night. It was so melt in your mouth delicious! Tender and savory, best outside skirt I've had. Ribeye - lots of fat, but was a bit more chewy than the other cuts. Filet Mignon - Not as tender as most filet mignons I've had, was my 4th fav dish.. Flat Iron - my 3rd fav dish! Came in a huge plate and we killed half of it. It was similar in taste to the outside skirt, but not quite as tender/soft. Porterhouse - 4th fav dish of the night! Oh man for a dry aged steak, it was delish. My friend has had their porterhouse at Crafsteak in NY and said it tasted just as good as the NY location.. . 3rd course: Desserts. Ice cream - Banana, Pistachio, white chocolate, and mixed berry swirl, and raspberry sorbet. The sorbet was a bit sour, I enjoyed the ice creams more especially pistachio. Cinnamon Monkey bread - I was so excited to try this since everyone kept talking about it. For some reason it didn't get topped w/ vanilla ice cream, but it was still good. The pecan toffee sauce made it addicting. This tastes basically like a cinnamon roll, but not as sweet. Chocolate Indulgence - Chocolate cake w/ caramel on the bottom. It was just ok. Caramel Cheesecake - Light & airy, but I prefer Capital Grille's cheesecake.. Apple caramel tart - Was basically like an apple pie tart. It wasn't overly sweet and the crust just lightly crumbles in your mouth. Loved it. Farmers Market Fruit - Everyone's favorite! Came w/ an assortment of fresh fruits. Our fav were the kumquat, starfruit, passionfruit, tangerine, and strawberry. Each were sweet and ripe. . I'll be back to try the surf & turf tasting menu!
Awesome food! Steaks are amazing! And service is great too,. 1.5 less star as we asked for 3 different steaks (filet mignon, prime, ny strip) all medium rare but they were cooked -really- differently, one too cooked, the other one not enough. I was fine with it but it did bother my friends. But great experience overall
let's begin by clarifying that I don't give out 5 stars haphazardly. It's gotta be special. Craft was, indeed, special.. I had the task of trying to find somewhere for a business/client dinner after a conference day. We decided on steak, so I looked for steakhouses in Vegas. Of course I love Tom Colicchio, so I figured Craftsteak had to be a good bet, coupled with other Yelp reviews, I made my choice.. From calling to set up the reservation for 11, to arriving and being greeted, seated, and served, the entire experience was fantastic. I was not disappointed in one single thing.. The 11 of us opted to order separate entrees and a bevvy of sides to share. I'll get to that in a minute. First, I want to comment on the Dark and Stormy that I ordered. One of my favorite drinks, a close second to the Moscow Mule, this one was hands down one of the best drinks I've ever had. Try it, prove me wrong.. As far as food, I ordered a fresh mozzarella with tomato and balsamic reduction appetizer, and it was creamy, fresh and delicious.  I also wanted to try the famed Hangar steak after hearing a co-worker rave about it. It was every bit as good as he made it out to be. Tender, yet packed full of flavor. Not too fatty, but not too lean. I could have cut it with a fork, and I'd order it again if I ever get the opportunity. The sides I tried, from the french fries to the grits to the sunchokes, were all super. After dinner, we of course had to have dessert. I opted for the tropical sorbet, and the mix of passion fruit and mango was so flavorful, I didn't want to share it. I also tried the monkey bread, amazing as well.. Bottom line. Worth it. Worth every penny. If you love meat, and you get the opportunity, don't pass this one up.
If I could give more than 5 stars, I easily would. Yes, it is expensive but after spending a week in Vegas trying different places, not near that bad! . Service was amazing. Very attentive & super fast even though the restaurant was busy!. Food was literally the best I've ever had. Hands down so amazing. . TRY the tasting menu! It seems kinda high but worth it!!! Thanks to our wonderful waiter we decided to give it a try & were very happy. Substituted a main course side without a problem and each course came very quickly . Ambience & noise level were spot on. . Yummy!!
I'll make this short and sweet...  Don't waste your money. Service is average at best. I got the impression that this was supposed to be a steakhouse. To be honest I've had better steak at Outback. Overpriced, underwhelming food.  700 dollars of disappointment.  Try one of the other 200 steakhouses if you're in Vegas. I guarantee they're all better than this place.
After scoping Yelp, we decided this would be our "fancy" Vegas dinner.  While we dressed up, other people were just wearing T-shirts.  Par for the course in this city.. . The place is big, warmly decorated and dimly lit.  Once you pass a bar with televisions, you enter the main dining room.. . Our server was great.  An older, friendly, talkative guy.  He told us the menu changes every day, depending on what produce their supplier buys that morning in California.. . You start with complimentary hot buttered, salted rolls in a skillet.  These were outstanding.. . I ordered the 16 oz. New York strip steak, grilled.  This was a massive piece of meat.  I ordered it medium rare, but it came out entirely pink.  Our server picked up the steak and summoned a new one.  Unfortunately, this meant my girl would have to eat while I waited.  When I got my new steak, it seemed closer to medium rare, but it was straight-up cold in the middle.  Not wanting to wait for a third steak, I just ate it.  Fairly middle-of-the-road.. . For sides, we ordered the Maui Onions, which my girlfriend loved.  They were a nice addition to any fork full of steak.  We also ordered the Potato Gratin.  Sadly, they tasted fairly bland.  We needed salt to bring them up to par.. . Another deduction: A photographer came around to snap several pictures of us.  About 15 minutes later, she returned with books of photos she tried to sell us for something like $130.  We didn't see her snapping pictures of any other couples.  Nothing like having to shoot down a sales pitch in the middle of a fancy dinner.. . While I liked the atmosphere and our server, the food fell short.  I really wish I'd enjoyed it more.
Had a great dinner last week.  Had the cucumber/watercress salad with an asian style dressing.  It was really great.  The steaks were perfect (bone-in rib eye) and the sides were all really good, not heavy like you get in some steakhouses.  The spinach was particularly good.  Excellent service.
The service is wonderful at Craftsteak! The food is less desirable. I had two bites of the lobster bisque and debated sending it back. The potato gratin side was delish, but the spinach was worse than I can cook at home and the risotto was nothing special. We also shared the baby squash which was very interesting but also nothing special. I shared a filet mignon with my sister and neither of us were wild about the steak. A friend had the baby bibb salad and she said it was DELISH but we left most of our steaks unfinished. Overall, disappointed to have chosen Craftsteak for our one fancy meal!. Great cocktails and very good wine selection.
This was to be the "Big Event" of our trip to Las Vegas this year. My husband and I were in town to celebrate 32 years together as a couple, and 2 days of being officially married. We had walked by Craftsteak many times on previous trips and decided that this would be a good place to splurge and celebrate our new legal status.. . ... and it was alright. I wasn't blown away like I kind of expected / hoped, but I wasn't exactly disappointed.. . We were seated in a large plush booth in the main dining room and had a wonderful server. He got our drink orders to us right away, brought us some very tasty bread, and explained that the items on the menu are meant to be enjoyed "family style"... meaning there will be large portions to share.. . We split a Caesar salad as an appetizer because we thought it would be enough for two, but it turned out that it really wasn't all that large. It was very good though! I discovered that I really like pickled white anchovies! We each ordered a medium-rare filet mignon for our main course. I ordered a side of risotto, and my husband ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms. Now -those- were some large portions!. . I didn't care much for the risotto. I think it was underdone. The mushrooms were good. The steaks were cooked perfectly, and were tasty, but I'd had -much- better at Annie's Paramount Steakhouse on 17th Street in Washington DC just a few days before. . . The drinks were good, the atmosphere was excellent, the service was excellent, and the server was very kind to bring us a small sweet something as a way of congratulating us on our marriage. Overall it was kind of a mixed bag. . . Still, I'm glad we finally went. We can finally stop talking about going there "one day".
A dinner I will never forget....
went here last year with my wife. both had filet,shrimp cocktail, caesar salads and chocolate volcano cake for dessert. . Ambience was ok. Steak was good. The highlight of my meal was the garlic mashed potatoes.Creamy and close to perfection.Best I have ever had!. gave it 2 stars for 2 reasons. Our waiter put the hard sell on us relentlessly to buy these $135. pkgs(all inclusive) What a turn off!Second I thought this place was overpriced compared to most hi end places in vegas.Not a relaxing great experience!
4.5 stars. Had the bone-in ribeye.. It was cooked perfectly to medium rare as I had requested. TASTY! - Not quite Mastros but very close. . Decent wine list with bottles starting at $60.. Great service with comfortable atmosphere, not too fancy. . Got out of there for $300 including tip. (2 steaks + 2 sides + bottle of Malbec)
