Not much to say about this mediocre buffet except that it came with my room so the price was right.  Plenty of food but some was inedible.  Didn't get sick though, that's a plus!
Food was good! Service was very slow and cold. This is the 2nd time I've come here. The 1st time my daughter 7 at the time she was 6 had a very large piece of glass in her juice and I felt like they only cared about if I was trying to get something for free. Foods good but I don't know if it worth the money or the wait.
This is my third trip to Vegas and have stayed at Aria each time. . . My wife and I where here in October 2012 and we visited the buffet one night for dinner. The price was about the $35 mark and we also brought the drinks package for the $12. . . We found the food was a great selection and the waitress was always filling our wine glass up each 5 minutes. .  . So under $100 we had a great value dinner with drinks and found the food was fresh and lots of flavours. . The waitress also told us that in a few months that the buffet was going to be upgraded. . . On the 4/4/2013 we returned back to Vegas and booked back in with Aria, we had a long flight from Miami and we're starving. So we made our way back to the Buffet for dinner. . . To our shock the price that night just to eat was $43 each, with taxes our and NO drinks our cost wad $97. But with a new seafood bar we thought it should be worth it. . . We started at the Chinese section and found the food well below par. . . We moved onto the "Fresh Seafood bar", I had the prawns, crab legs. I took one bite of the prawns and they had no taste, I then startedon the Crab legs and they too had no taste. The taste was like they had been defrosted and left in cold water for hours before been placed in the bar. . . I left a entire plate of seafood on my table that I was unable to eat. . . The only saving grace at the buffet is the Red meat section, the beef was full of flavour and had a great pink centre to it. . . For a price of $100, we were left with a huge disappointment not only from the buffet, but also from the waitress that because we decided not to buy the drinks package we had to ask for water at each time. . . I doubt that I will every return to the buffet on our next return to Aria.
Pricy & gave me diarrhea for two days. One of the reasons why I am vegan now. No need to eat expensive diarrhea food when I can do it for less than $10 at McDonalds!
This is probably even a one star because there is very little I liked about the food. I've been to most of the buffets on the strip and this was one of the worst. The quality of food is poor. We only ended up going here because it was complimentary with our hotel stay. My suggestion for people reading this is to go to Caesar's. Far better.... . The food just wasn't very good. I did like the pizza and it was fresh. Everything else just wasn't to my taste or to anyone else in our groups liking. I wouldn't pay to eat here, seriously not worth eat.
Great selection but nothing was amazing. And for $32 on a Saturday that just didn't cut it for me. Not a terrible stop if you're wanting all you can drink as well but it's not a destination by any means.
Good food. Lots of choices. Kind of pricey at $25 for a lunch Buffett. Nonetheless if you are looking for a decent buffet, check this place out. At the same time, you could get a great meal for the same price at a restaurant.
Any place that serves pork belly wins me over! I was surprised to see that there was pork belly at the carvery. It's been a while since I've been to a Vegas buffet, but it doesn't seem like a common option from what I could remember. There was a large variety of meats at the carvery including chicken, BBQ beef brisket, sausage, pork belly, pork shoulder and more. . . There was different cuisines from American to Chinese to Italian to Japanese (sushi) and more. They had pretty much anything you can think of and the food was well stocked. It never seem to run out. There was also a good selection of seafood including king crab legs which were quite fresh.. . The desserts were just as delicious as they looked. The small portions allowed you to try multiple ones. I had the tiramisu, flan, whoopee pie and a few others which were all amazing.. . I would definitely come back. It was a great value for only $25 a person for lunch. We also had a 2-for-1 coupon from MyVegas which made it an even better value. My two friends also got bottomless alcoholic drinks for $15 each. The variety of bottomless drinks  included bellinis, sangria, different wines and beers, as well as mimosas, champagne and others.
The buffet was our least favorite of restaurants on site. I never find any buffet food up to standard as it's just a place to gorge yourself. This was pretty much the same. We wanted to try it because everyone says the buffets in Vegas are the best. The hot foods were mediocre-good, but the desserts were really tasty. Whomever is making those desserts can do with a raise because I went back for seconds.. . The tandoori chicken at the Indian station sat too long and was dry. The curry was good. Everyone goes mental for pre-cracked crab legs, I never really understood that. They feel as if they are getting one-up on the man if they shove 40 crab legs down their throat. The cioppino was being stored at a very dangerous temperature. I had one sip and realized it wouldn't be wise to continue eating it. The asian station was a step-up mainly because it was busy so the food was being made fresh. The carvery was good as well, the roast chicken was juicy and tasty. The sushi wasn't bad although it wasn't freshly rolled and the choices were limited. Who doesn't love cured meats and cheeses, can't go wrong at the italian station.
The Buffet at Aria is a solid choice when you're hungry and you aren't quite sure what you want. That's the reason my husband and I went during our recent stay at Aria. . . We showed up for a late lunch around 2:30 or so and there wasn't a line, so we were seated immediately.. . There is a lot to choose from! I sampled the gnonchi with a meat and tomato sauce, several pieces of tuna sushi, California rolls, carnitas, a vegetarian salad with black beans in it, crab legs, fresh fruit, and chocolate cake.  My husband had a similar dining experience. . . Nothing really stood out as excellent, but everything was good. The atmosphere was nice, and the lady who cleared the plates and refreshed drinks was on top of her game.. . I'm not sure I'd go rushing back any time soon, unless I stay at the Aria again. I'm happy to have tried it, checked it off my list, and I'm ready to move on.
Came here for Memorial Weekend brunch with my guy, impressed by the quality of food and the mega-attentive and friendly service- Flor is a gem!. . Breakfast options were out in full force, with stars being the smoked eggs benedict available made to order by the omelet station- very tasty! Also memorable were the smoked trout and lox, and I'm a big fan of peel-and-eat shrimp and the ones here were large and meaty. . Appreciated that there were many healthy options available, including the salad bar, lots of fresh fruit, and various oatmeal/parfait/grits stations with additional toppings.  The charcuterie area was quite nice, too, with a variety of sausages and all of the components for an amazing cheese plate- three cheeses, two dried meats, dried fruits, candied walnuts and roasted cashews. Very classy!. . Cool to see dim sum available- haven't seen this at other places but wish the selection was a little larger. Was able to have lamb shu mai, and two other mislabelled items, but there seemed to be quite a few baskets out but only a few different items.. . Was a little surprised to see the carving station available at brunch- BF took advantage of the prime rib, lamb leg, and rotisserie chicken, all of which he said were great. I tried the Yukon gold mashed potatoes, which were like heaven. No exaggeration, they were amazing!. . Dessert was also impressive- all made by Jean Phillipe, super tasty and beautiful presentation. Chocolate raspberry cake pop was the favorite, would have preferred other cake pop flavors rather than so many plated cake slices. Cookies were dry and crunchy, and I prefer warm and chewy, so I did not sample any. The round, spinning ice cream case was a hit with kids and adults alike.. . I'm a firm believer in quality and would rather have fewer options that are better-executed than a lot of mediocre dishes out for the sake of variety, so this is a place I prefer over some others.
It's much better than I thought by viewing the previous reviews. The classes of food are not that much but the sweet and Asia ones are really good.
