Okay, it is a rare thing when a restaurant lives up to its reputation.  Pizza Bianco certainly did that. The service was good. The salad was excellent. And the pizza was amazing. We order three different ones and we all sampled each. . . The thin crust was delicious. The toppings excellent. . . Nothing bad to say on this one.
As a pizza snob, I've been to my fair share of good spots and Bianco is up there with the best. My girlfriend and avid yelper tells me though that i'm not supposed to post 5 stars unless its consistently the BEST i've ever had, so I'll abstain and go for a solid 4. . . I usually go for a basic red sauce pie with cheese and prosciutto. I'm not big for the white sauce. Their bread is great and they always have a nice, albeit small selection of beers. They've also opened up a location in Town and Country off of Camelback and 18th st, which makes it much more accessible to those unwilling to travel downtown and face potentially monstrous wait times for their dinner.
Love this restaurant, and the pizza, but the hour and a half wait is just not worth it.
Everything from the atmosphere to the wine was as five stars as a pizza place can get. I can't recommend this enough. We got the spaghetti and cheese pizza, splitting both. I definitely recommend splitting a pasta because it's of giagantic porportions.
First trip here in awhile.  A couple of things to update since my last visit.  For starters, they now have longer hours so you can take in this place for lunch, dinner, or a mid-afternoon meal.  We came here for lunch around Noon on a Saturday and didn't have to wait long for a spot inside.  Second, they now have dessert offerings.  Today I had their flourless chocolate cake and it wasunquestionably the best flourless chocolate cake I've ever had.  Smooth, rich, velvety texture that is easily sharable.  The one thing that hasn't changed much are the pizzas.  The pizzas choices are limited, but good and are made in the same brick oven that has garnered worldwide acclaim for years.  Today my family and I split a margherita, a wise guy (a white pizza with sausage, mozzarella & onion), and a biancoverde (a white pizza with three different cheeses and arugula).  All had great clean texture and a crispy crust.. . Bianco is a Phoenix institution and now has locations in central Phoenix and soon will be opening a location in Tucson.  With good reason.  It's good pizza.  But despite the hype and the accolades, I still can't declare this the best pizza I've had in AZ.  That title still belongs to Pomo just down the road in Downtown Phoenix.  In my own humble opinion, Cibo and Bianco are pretty evenly matched, but Pomo is just a step above.. . That said, Bianco has a great product and (as long as you're okay waiting in line for awhile) is worth trying at least once.  From the ambience of its historic downtown location, to the friendly servers and pizzailolos, Bianco definitely offers a unique experience.  Some of you might even find you like Bianco more than the other local titans I mentioned.  Just be sure to pack your patience when you ask for a table.
Great pizza, ok service. The dining room is very small. They only have like 6 different pizza choices, only 2 of which are vegetarian. We went on a Monday at 3pm, and we got a table right away. But I can see how it can get crowded on the weekends with its close proximity to stadiums. We parked in the parking structure by the science museum and walked through the park.
Doesn't live up to the hype. . We had 2 different pizzas there today. Both were dry and overdone. Not chewy at all, like a good brick oven pizza should be. . . On the plus side, the place is in a cute, 1920s era building & the Caprese salad was great. . . Won't be back. Totally not worth the drive or the wait.
Was so excited to eat here after all the hype. A bit disappointed. CIBO has much better food and much more variety!  My husband doesn't like "fufu" food so difficult for him to pick a pizza!  He chose the Bolognese Parpadelle (meat spaghetti) and it was bland. My pizza came out a bit burnt.
My current favorite in Phoenix. The bread and crust is the flakiest golden love I've ever eaten. I got 2 entrees last time because it was so awesome.
I've been going to Bianco's since Chris opened his first one at Town and Country Shopping Center. His dedication to family and local suppliers is commendable. Short list of Pizza's and salads, but all is first rate ingredients and service. Often mentioned as the best pizza in USA so give it a try!
OK. I'm calling this one. Either this restaurant has perpetrated one of the most successful internet review scams in history or I visited during an epic meltdown in the kitchen. As repeatedly hyped by reviewer after reviewer, I was expecting a well above average pizza comparable to those in New York. Instead, I was shocked to be served the worst pizza in my life.  Honestly, my high school cafeteria's had more flavor. The bland crust had ok texture, but when topped by a scant amount of what tasted like canned tomato sauce and packaged mozzarella, I could barely get through it. And how did they find utterly flavorless basil? I'll never know. The fact that an amazing pizzeria (Mama Mia's on Indian School) exists just a couple miles away makes me sick that I wasted my time and money at this place. I visited the Town & Country location FYI. Won't be back. Ever.
i love this place, and i love the pizza. :)
A little pricey. Great service! Ok food.
If you have never been, you haven't lived!  Anything you get is amazing, all the ingredients are local and fresh.
Dewey's Cafe 99, located at 11001 N 99th Ave, Peoria, AZ quickly became one of our favorite restaurants. It opened a couple of months ago and serves all day. Our favorite breakfast is $3.45 for 2 eggs, bacon (thick-sliced) or sausage, potatoes and toast or a delicious crispy-edged, fluffy-in-the-middle pancake. They recently started serving bbq and we're anxious to try it. The beef sandwich is large and very tasty with great au jus. The dewey sauce adds to ANY sandwich a creamy, slightly spicy experience. The hamburgers are cooked to perfection. The catfish are lightly breaded with (we think) cornmeal and delectable! We also discovered they're able to accommodate larger groups. They have daily lunch and supper specials as well as the regular menu. Staff are very friendly and we always receive great service.
After hearing that this place was endorsed by Oprah's friend,Gale, as the best pizza in the US, I was skeptical, considering that NY and Chicago have more worthy pizzerias.. . It's in an area which is desolate at night except for this pizzeria.  We had a 1.5 hour wait so the hostess recommended us getting a drink at the bar next door.. . There were 4 in our party so we ended up ordering the Margherita, Wiseguy, Rosa and Biancaverde.  The only pizza that we all felt wasn't that great was the Rosa.  It had a few cheeses on top plus AZ pistachios.  It just wasn't flavorful and was quite dry.  The wine paired with the pizzas was great.  . . Service was exceptional!  . . I wouldn't say that this place is the best pizzeria in the US but probably best in AZ.  Check it out if in area but be prepared to wait.
Tried 3 different pizzas and the Wiseguy won. . . Pizza selection was minimal. . . Great service.
When I heard I was going to Phoenix on business, the first two words I thought were "Pizzeria Bianco." Food and Wine named them one of the "Best Pizza Spots in the U.S.," and Bald Bryan was always singing their praises on the Adam Carolla Show. So of course I had to check them out.. . Besides the high praise, I had also always heard to expect a long wait. So I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at 6 and found several empty seats outside. I ordered a pizza, half Rosa and half Wiseguy, and some of the house white wine. The Rosa had red onion, Parmesan, rosemary, and pistachios. The Wiseguy was topped with smoked mozzarella, roasted onion, and fennel sausage. Both choices were good, but not as awesome as I had expected. I actually was more impressed with the house wine.. . This is a traditional wood-fired pizza, light on the toppings and with no tomato sauce. And while I have no problem with that, I've had much better wood-fired pizzas elsewhere. That said, I'll leave it up to you whether this is one of the best pizza places in America. I definitely think it's worth a visit, but not if you have to wait three hours. And if you're eating by yourself, as I was, I suggest getting a half and half (definitely try the Wiseguy; I'll leave the other half up to you).
Yea it's bland crust and a few toppings.. . The hype for this place is ridiculous. . . It is NOTHING special at all, and it is not worth the high price.
Great atmosphere, great food! Love the little wine bar and out door brick area for waiting customers. Quaint. We had a great moms night out
This quaint, little house is a perfect place for a date! the food is great and the staff is friendly.
I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this yet!. . This a cute little restaurant tucked away in a tiny neighborhood. Find a place to park, then walk through a little Phoenix history en route to a slice. There was a bit of wait, but they have a bar next door where you can get drinks while you wait and that makes it go by quickly. Everything on the menu is very share-friendly: pizzas, big salads, etc. Crust is perfect and delicious, and of course you will have great breakfast leftovers. Highly recommend!
Very good food and great ambiance. The only problem is the wait, since the place is small there is usually an hour wait to get a table. I would suggest getting there early to put your name in, then having a drink next door. The pizza is close to what you find in Italy. Thin hand tossed crust with fresh toppings and the wood fired oven gives it a delicious taste.
What can you say?  Excellent pizza, very long wait.  One of those things you do for a special occasion or when you have out-of-town guests.
Amazing pizza and pastas.  We had to go twice in our 2 week stay in AZ.. Will be dreaming about our next visit.  The Gnocchi dish was over the top good.  The browning method in the pan gives the whole dish a nice toasted potato flavour. Service was excellent and the locations/ambiance gave the perfect setting for an upscale Italian meal experience.. . A restaurant Phoenix should be very proud to have.
Just stop.  I know you all read Yelp and try to see if the reviewers know what they are saying, have similar taste, have a clue.. . How Pizza Bianco is not 5 star amazes me.  It shows the flaw in Yelp that there are actually higher rated pizza places in Phoenix, when there should be no better rated in the world.. . I am from NY, traveled the world and have been to Naples, Rome, Sicily, etc.  When my flight lands in Phoenix I beeline it to Pizza Bianco.  Burnt crust, light but textured, fresh but straightforward toppings.  . . Now that there is no or little wait it can truly be enjoyed! Go and go quickly.  Whoever is not giving it 5 stars is simply judging it against the fact that it gets rave reviews.  And from my standpoint the rave reviews are well deserved!
Pizzeria Bianco isn't just a restaurant, it's an institution.  Ever since I moved to the Valley of the Sun five years ago, I've watched peoples' eyes glaze over as they ramble on and on about how amazing the food is there; many argue that it serves up the best pizza in Phoenix (if not the country).  Why it took me so long to get there is a mystery but after going today, I can unequivocally say that the rumors are all true - it is fabulous!. . LOGISTICS: Nestled in the Southeast corner of Heritage Square near the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco sits in a rather small brick building with an outdoor patio and charming little bar.  While the space restriction makes for a more intimate dining experience, I could easily see this place becoming swarmed with diners during peak hours; so perhaps coming before or after the main lunch/dinner rush would be a good idea for those who are patience-challenged or in a time crunch.  Park in the structure off of 5th and Monroe - the restaurant validates your ticket (I ended up paying $0 instead of the usual $12).  . . FOOD: Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the Market Salad, which consisted of fresh local cantaloupe and honeydew melon, cucumbers, mint, red onions, and peppers served in a yogurt dressing; it was hands-down one of the most creative and refreshing salads I've ever had!  They serve their sodas in old fashioned glass bottles and bring freshly-baked bread with olive oil to your table - haven't had olive oil that good in ages!  If you can't decide on one pizza combo, they're great about doing halfsies.  I ordered a half Margherita, half Rosa (red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios) pizza - both were sheer perfection!  Crust is heavenly, ingredients are beyond fresh, innovative toppings - who'dve thunk pistachios would taste so good on a pizza?!      . . SERVICE: Pizzeria Bianco runs like a well-oiled machine.  The service staff is amazing - both friendly and fast.  They greet every single guest who comes and goes - pretty impressive! . . I don't really think you can go wrong here.  I came in skeptical but left a believer; somehow they worked their magic over on me - another happy Pizzeria Bianco customer.  A thousand flies can't be wrong!  ;)
Expect to wait. Sunday at 9 pm room about 45 minutes for a table. I gave waited up to 3 hours! . . Was served bread and oil immediately and the bartender was awesome!. . Best pizza in America according to many including Oprah! . . Menu is basic my favorites are the marghertita and sonny boy but I have experienced the entire menu and love them all! One pizza has a TON of great meat.. . I love this place
Fresh local ingredients and great service.
Pizza here is as amazing as you hear it is.  If you want to come here and not wait forever, come on a weeknight when there is no Diamondbacks, Suns, or any other professional sports games, or any other large event downtown.  You'll wait less than an hour.  Definitely worth it.
Good pizza. But this place is waayyyy over hyped!  Small crowded and an antsy staff excited for you to vacate the table. Pizza lacked richness and salt.  Good place give them a try but we were left less then satisfied.  Once again the Hipsters have taken over Yelp.
It almost lived up to the hype. Very good pizza.
We don't get all they hype about this place?! We are a 46 year old couple with no kids and dine out at least 3 nights a week. We love to try new places.. . I always read Yelp for great, fun places to go for date night. This time I didn't have time to read the reviews but I had heard this place was on Oprah or the travel channel or some cooking show, so It's got to be great right? . . This date night we had tickets to see Les Miserables at 7:30 on a Saturday for my Man's B-day. I called the restaurant on Tuesday to see about getting reservations for Saturday because I had heard about the nightmarish wait times because it is just THAT GOOD! They said they only allow 4 reservations and they were all full. Umm, ok...Well that's just wonderful. I explained that we were willing to come early so we could be through and get to Phoenix Theatre for our show. The woman said to call back at 4:30 on Saturday and she would tell us how long the wait would be. I did and we got in after 10 minutes! (at 5 pm) Yay! I thought, this is a great start to birthday night.  . . When we walked in it was extremely cramped, the tables are almost on top of each other. A very large man was seated behind us and I saw people just give up and go around. It was also EXTREMELY LOUD, the loudest place I have been in quite a while. We wereseated right in the middle at a tiny table that barely had elbow room. I started to feel claustrophobic and couldn't hear a thing my man was saying and he couldn't hear me. I spotted and pointed to a newly vacant table in the corner and we made a mad dash for it. Ahhh... a little quieter but I still couldn't hear well. . . Then I looked at the menu which was only about four choices of pizza to order from. I thought that we would share a pizza but when the waitress came by she explained that the pizzas were about the size of a dinner plate and most adults get their own. Then I looked at the price and about had a heart attack! Now, I am not a tightwad, I will pay dearly for excellent food. Then I was shocked to see that for the price we were going to pay the salads were not included? Really? This is a pizza joint, not the Four Seasons Resort. . . The pizza came quickly. I was soooooooo disappointed. I am what you might call a pizza whore. I could eat pizza every day. I won't though because I would be huge. I ordered the Margherita and my man had the Sonny Boy. We were never served any bread and oil while we waited either. The pizza crust was so thin I bet I could have seen light through it and the sides were burnt.  I get the wood fired oven thing but this was ridiculous! There was a tiny amount of sauce, even tinier amount of cheese and 4, count 'em, FOUR pieces of basil. Now, I'm not saying it tasted bad after I broke off all the burnt pieces, it was just ok. It was nothing special and not worth the 40.00 we spent for 2 small pizzas and no drinks with tip. My hands were black and my man somehow got black all down his white sleeve. Then driving to the show in the car I noticed that I had black all over my neck! I know I really get into my pizza but come on! I shouldn't need a bath after. We won't bother coming here again because when we left I said to my man with a big grin on my face "I'm still hungry where should we go for dinner?" He laughed and said "Me too! That was a huge rip off for $40.00 and you leave hungry."  Our conversation was overheard by some guy and he said "I hear that a lot." Hmmmmmm
I'm a New Yorker who knows his pizza, and a former LA resident in love with Nancy Silverton's Pizzeria Mozza. I was skeptical about pizza in Phoenix, but I will have to say that Bianco more than met my test. I enjoyed a nice red blend wine ($9) and a pizza that was half Rosa (white sauce with pesto and pistachios), and half Margherita with fennel sausage. The mozzerella on the Margherita was itself worth coming to the restaurant, but the pizza crust baked in the charcoal oven was outstanding. I can't really say which of the two pizza halves I enjoyed more, but I am a sucker for fennel sausage (Mozza's is a bit better and seemed more fresh, but I am not complaining). . . I promised not to eat the whole pizza myself, but I couldn't help it. The crust was thin, and besides, Oprah thinks it is the best pizza ever. If Oprah says it is, then I must eat at all so as not to disappoint her. . . I arrived without a reservation, and I was immediately seated by a very friendly host who kept checking on me throughout the evening. Great service and excellent food, and one of the must stops in Phoenix.
This place is completely and overwhelmingly overhyped. The pizza was tasteless and probably one of my least favorite I've ever had. Grazie and Grimaldi's are by far greater and underrated. Pizza Bianco had dust that should warrant the attention of the health department. If I could I would give this place 4 thumbs down. Overrated!!!!
IMHO the whole Pizzeria Bianco hype is a little bit  overrated.. The last time we went there we were told it would take 4 hours to get a table......Are you serious? Who in the right mind wants to wait 4 hours in front of a pizza place to get seated?. While the pizza is great it is not the best.. Do yourself a favor and go to the Town and Country location, same pizza even to go.. I still prefer The Parlor over Pizza Bianco.
