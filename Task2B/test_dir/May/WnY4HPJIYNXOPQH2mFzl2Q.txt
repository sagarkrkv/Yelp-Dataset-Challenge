I have stayed here twice now and I haven't been super impressed. For an upscale hotel I was surprise by the lack of service. . . 1) what hotel charges for wine openers?! I have stayed at hotels that are 3 stars or the hilton who offer wine openers for free. It is Vegas! Have a wine opener available. I realize the mini bar has only twist off, but for what we are paying to stay at a fancy hotel, there is no excuse. . . 2) On the first night out, we went out for a taxi and had to wait 20 min for a van since there was 5 of us. No problem. We didn't mind the wait. The bell desk was able to text or contact the Mandalay side and ask for a van cab. So the next night going out, we called the service desk and ask for them to call a van cab for us since we didn't want to wait 20 min this time. The service desk said they couldn't call the taxi...fine. Then I asked if they could contact the be desk and ask them to call a van for or make sure there was one down there. The said they could contact them. I feel like for the caliber of hotel "the hotel" claims to be, they should be able to communicate to all parts of the hotel. As customers, when you call down and they ask how assist you?and when you advertise the needs of the guest are priority, you don't want to be heard the answer no, or at least hear them say let me see what I can do. Again, most hotels would be able to accommodate this. . I feel most taxi's go mainly to the Mandalay side and not as many go to "the hotel" and as result, you should be willing to accommodate. Especially since we knew the bell cap was able to communicate with the taxi's on the Mandalay side or the dispatcher. . . When we checked out, the service desk didn't even ask "how was our stay?." Printed the bill and asked how we wanted to pay. It was only then that we brought up these concerns and she said the same things.... Again, what "high caliber" hotel says no, or doesn't say, let me see what I can do. . . What made matters worse is all he construction noise you hear while talking to the service or at the service desk as well. . . The hotel it self was fine, the room was big enough for 4 people, but one star for the poor service. Will never stay here agin. Would rather stay somewhere with better service!
I stayed here over Easter weekend and it was a mess. I stayed here once before and it was great, maybe because it was a less busy weekend. We planned a big bachelor/bachelorette weekend with 13 people coming to stay at this hotel. When we arrived and checked in, our room was supposed to have two queen beds. Our reservation stated two queen beds because we had four people staying in the room and needed the extra bed. The front desk lady said that they didn't have any of these rooms available yet (even though we reserved one) and that they only had rooms with one king bed in it. We were told that even though we select two queen beds when reserving a room, it is just a "preference". This doesn't make sense at all because clearly my email states two queen beds. This wasn't a huge deal because after about 20 minutes of arguing, they half-promised a room the next day with two queen beds. Our other guests were arriving the next day so I only needed the one bed for the first night. They promised that when our real room was available the next day they would come get our bags and move the bags into the correct room. They also said that we could go to the Mandalay Bay and book there if we wanted. What kind of business is that? We pay extra money and reserve a nice expensive room and now we are told to go stay in the cheaper, older, and noisier Mandalay Bay. Oh, or we can have cot sent up to our room. Yes, because we want to pay $200 per night so two people can sleep on a cot.. . The next day comes and instead of spending time at the pool or doing Las Vegas things, I spend an hour again atthe front desk explaining the situation to a different person. They finally tell us the room number that will be reserved for us and that it just needs to be cleaned. We end up having to move our own bags to the new room because no one notifies us when the room is ready. I have to go back to the front desk to find out if its done getting cleaned. I also explained to them that our friends booked the exact same suite with two beds and they are coming later that day. They again half-promised that they would get set up correctly in the right room. They arrived around midnight Friday and low and behold, did not get the room they reserved. They got set up in the incorrect room again because it's still overbooked at TheHotel. They took the wrong room because they really had no choice at this point and one of the guests got a cot. The next day comes and since they were the bride and groom, I argued on their behalf to the front desk agents. Again, another hour of explaining to them that we booked multiple rooms all with two queen beds for this occasion. Nothing was done to help us out or feel comfortable thinking that we would get our reservations taken care of. . . Eventually, after arguing and complaining about how our reservation was never handled correctly, almost all of my guests ended up having to book a room at the regular Mandalay Bay. We did this by walking over to their front desk and starting over. TheHotel front desk couldn't even help with that. Apparently it's common practice for TheHotel to overbook even though we paid a deposit and had paid over $1,000 for each room over four days. 12 guests, 6 rooms, you do the math. With such a big investment into reservations you would think the reservation would hold something. It reminded me a lot of a Seinfeld episode. "You know how to take the reservation, but you don't know how to HOLD the reservation.". . We were all supposed to have $75 credit for drinks but that never got subtracted to our bill. It was part of the original reservation as a special New Years Getaway package that they sold but it never actually worked. We complained again at the front desk when we checked out but they couldn't figure out math. They said the $75 credit gets magically taken away on the bill and doesn't really show up. Most of us that stayed in Vegas work in accounting as a living, and in order to show what was added or subtracted, we need numbers on a receipt. They explained to us that it just doesn't show up. What did show up was our drink charges though for ~$75 per room (the ones that actually stayed at THeHOtel). . . The front desk people were the worst customer service reps. I have encountered anywhere in Las Vegas. For a city that is based around your customers, you need to straighten this out. One complaint anywhere else and at least you get an apology, we never even got that. Most places will give you free drinks at the bar.. . My recommendation is to not stay here at all if you don't have to. If it is a holiday weekend I would especially avoid the Mandalay Bay and The Hotel. It is littered with children and it will def. be overbooked. Which means good luck trying to get the room you reserved months ahead of time.. . Side notes - Why do people bring children to Las Vegas?. . Half-promise = Customer service people claim that your room will be ready, although can not promise or guarantee it will be.
Quick update to note that the Hotel contacted me directly, addressed my concerns, and made me confident that another stay there would not have the same issues!
Booked the "O" Suite at The Hotel for surprise 80th birthday. We booked the room about a month in advance. After the 4.5 hour drive from LA, just wanted to kick it in the room and chill...It was about 4 pm, check in is 3 pm.. . Now, the last thing you want to hear when trying to check in is "I'm sorry your room in not ready"...OMG! I'm a little perturbed at this point. We are spending $750 a night, prepaid, its now 4pm & room NOT READY!! Wow.. . We booked a total of 4 rooms, none were ready at 4pm. A little disturbing since LV hotels are getting more strict as to check in time (now most are 4 pm) , but want you checked the hell out at 11 am! Ostensibly to get room clean for next guest!!!! Well???. . Hotel employee was very helpful. I realize it wasnt his fault, But it is hard not to take it out on people who are assisting you. So, after some discussion back and forth, the nice person upgraded us to the "L" Suite...which was simply wonderful! A beautiful suite with nice view and very acccomdating for the party of 18.. . One issue, the TV near the jacuzzi tub was not working...Oh Well!. . Our only issue with room...no refrigerator, no microwave, no utensils whatsoever. Oh well, I dont understand why some of these accomodations are not included, Yes, you can rent them for $35, which we did for microwave.. . All the personnel we came across at The Hotel were very nice and very inviting. From the Valet staff, to the Desk Personnel, to the Housekeeping Staff...All were very nice to us, constantly greeting us and making us feel special.. . Would I stay here again? Yes! We are re-booking for another birthday party... I think the personnel make the difference here. Nicely done...
From the looks,  this hotel rock ... but don't be fooled,  it's a shit hotel made to look nice from the outside. I'm on floor 5 and can hear every sound from the club below. The walls are paperthin and I won't be ever staying here again. Make up on a huge pig.
So here's the deal. I upgraded to the suite this weekend with the thought that it would be nice to spend some downtime in the room. What I've discovered is that they charge, a lot, for everything. Want to keep beverages cool? $35 per night for a mini fridge. Want coffee in your room? $4 per keurig cup. Who charges for in room coffee?. . Rooms are average and the tower location is away from all the hotel amenities which are located at the Mandalay tower. I really regret "upgrading" and wish I was in a smaller, cheaper room in the Mandalay Tower. . . I do not recommend THE Hotel.
Check in service was efficient dispute the long line. There was about 30 people waiting and it took about 15 min. Hotel staff was very friendly and the view from the room is spectacular. The huge problem I have is the integrity after check out. We ate a bag of nuts from the bar and was charged $45! After almost 4 weeks I was charge again on my credit card $18. I believes credit card was compromised at the hotel. They sent me a survey and explained the incident with the credit card and they have yet to respond. It's been 3 weeks! Very upset and would recommend this Hotel at all. They are lucky they had a star!!!
I wish I'd read the reviews on Yelp before booking a room here. It really is a 1-2 star hotel hiding behind the Mandalay Bay facade.  Multiple issues.  First, booked Mandalay Bay and ended up here.  Second, tiny, room on the other side of the complex. Third, it's just lacking a lot of really basic amenities and services.  While superficially high-end the experience is like staying in a freeway-side motel where you pay in cash.  Unfortunately the booking rate is the same as the Mandalay.  My advice is stay away unless you like the feeling of being fleeced.
I loved this hotel. The rooms were comfortable, stylish and clean. The bath products in the rooms were awesome too. Its a bit of a walk to the pool from this section of Mandalay Bay but thats ok. Im sad TheHotel is being converted into the Delano.
Please know I am writing this review as this trip  was VERY disappointing at The Hotel.. . Emailed them THREE times and no response at all, wanted to be fair and give them a chance.. . Pictures attached are the proof.. . The condition of the room and the stay over all was terrible. . . 1. We arrive and the paper view on demand was not working correctly and we tried to rent a movie for our kids to watch.. . 2. The lamp in the bedroom was broken, did not work on the night stand and about to fall apart, we noticed right before we put the kids to bed and had the repair man come the next day at 8:30 am so the kids would not be waken up for our first night there. We cracked the bath room door to have light in the bed room. . . 3.The bath tub was dirty have pictures of dirt in tub when we arrived in the room. ( have picture) . . 4. Then the bath tub was still not cleaned on our second day there as well after housekeeping came , the did not clean the tub.. . 5. The second day they did not replenish the shampoo or  conditioner as well. . . 6. The bath room had titles coming off the walls near the shower and was dangerous as the shower was leaking really bad and  there was water all over the bath room titles and the titles where loose as well as we walked. The leak must have been there for some time to have the titles loose under our feet . ( have pictures) . . 7. The bed comforter had stains all over them and smelled bad. ( have pictures) . . 8. Night stand had scratches and the finish was coming off the top and it had dirt on the night stand as well. ( have pictures) . . We stayed on 11 floor room 803 , this room really needs repair. Please repair this room. . This was such a  BIG disappointment as we flew out there to relax but instead had a terrible room that is need of cleaning and of many repairs.. . In the past we have stayed here at The Hotel  and the Mandalay many times and the rooms have never been this terrible,what  happened?. . What happened ?
THEhotel is amazing! The views are incredible and the rooms are absolutely upscale boutique hotel quality. It is located within walking distance of Mandalay Bay and several amazing restaurants.
