Luxury with considerably above (the Vegas)  average class. Excellent restaurants, one of the top three buffets, and of course,  the amazing fountains. The absence of  a theme may well be the magic here.
Rooms are nicely furnished and spacious, Fountain Brunch ($58 each not including coffee!)  was okay to do once, wouldn't go again for the money and quality of food, the pool was huge but the bar hop Ursala wanted to keep my wife's $12 change for a lousy soda.  The casino itself was tight, tight and tight...might as well put half the money you'd spend gambling in the room safe and burn the other half.  Slot machines rake it in, never saw anyone walk away with even their initial investment.  The odds at the Sportsbook were horribly bad compared to the Harrah's MGM group.   Nice as the atmosphere was, I think we'll stay at the Venetian or Aria in the future.  At least there's a broader spectrum of eateries and shows to choose from.
My wife and I had our wedding here in October, 2012 after deciding the traditional wedding wasn't the route we wanted to go. We ended up spending about $2500 on the smaller chapel at the hotel. We could not have asked for more. The complete process could not have been simpler. After providing the payment, asking for certain items to be added, they simply told us "be here at this time, on this date." That's exactly what we did and it was all taken care of. . . The hotel itself is wonderful. For this occasion we stayed in one of their suites with a living space, three bathrooms, and entry - not 100% sure what it's called. It was always clean and tidy. They left chocolates on our pillows (small touch-  but it's food!). . . Restaurants and gambling were top notch as well. . . We will be back.
so I stayed here the past weekend with the bf.  He booked the room since he stays and plays here all the time.. . Oh he fancy! hehe. . Pros:. - Bed was super comfy. - Maid staff was kind and friendly. - room was spacious. - great channels to watch on your downtime. - we had a great view of the pools. - not as crowded as most hotels. - located in the middle of the strip. . Cons:. - no refrigerator . - drink waitresses take forever coming to you/ or u can't find one at all. - drinks were way weak. . Overall, I had an amazing stay here! Super classy and very clean!
This was my fifteenth trip to Vegas - at least. and you know, I never spend any time at the Bellagio - not even for the fancy-dancy fountain show. BUT my DH had only ever been once and stayed primarily at one hotel with a pregnant wife. His one and only experience of Vegas sounded so terribly boring that I had to take him on the full meal deal tour. . . We spend our last afternoon at the sport bar in Bellagio drinking cocktails and betting small time cash on the VLTS. Had a great time meeting people. . . What I will say is that the bar staff is snotty. I ordered a dirty gin martini, they thought I said VIRGIN martini so they just never came back to clarify and never poured me a drink. That was beyond "wow" for me. . . I don't think I'll be staying there anytime soon.
Much better than my last visit. All the usual plusses - clean and spacious rooms, comfy beds, amazing shopping. Had the usual hassle at check-in with the 'one king or two queen' bed dilemma. Seriously Bellagio, if I am staying with a parent/aunt I do not wish to snuggle in a king size bed with them, nor do I care for a rollaway when I have specifically requested two beds. Anyways, had a lot of fun, especially at the Jasmine Brunch, oh and we got to try out the hotels 911 emergency response... it's top notch.. . Room Tip: If you don't want to walk for hours to get to your room, request one close to the elevators. The hotel is huge!
We realy liked the rooms, and the water show is on point at night. Its also close to the strip but it lacks restaurants and the ones they do have close pretty early. Over all its a great hotel and we would stay there again.. Shauuu!!
Great place if you can find a deal on rooms. It's cenrally located and has every amitinty you can ask for, not to meantion it's beautiful.
Very nice, only exception is the pure volume of people is insane. Service is very good in every aspect. Restrooms are always clean and available. Water/light show is spectacular. As with most guests that will admit it my pot of gold did not arrive yet. Still a lot of time to go..
Probably one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in.  Beautiful views of the mini Eiffel Tower and Bellagio water show.  Modern, posh suites with plentiful towels, luxe toiletries and modern tech amenities.  The staff are friendly and polite.  I do think the shop and cafe are extremely overpriced ($8 for a bic lighter!).  And it was super crowded when I was there so checkin took approx 30 minutes.  It's also a pain to walk through the casino just to get to the front desk while lugging suitcases.  . . Overall enjoyed my stay and would rec the Bellagio.  Loved the art, decor, cleanliness, and location on the strip.
This review is for the Prada store in the Belagio. The sales people there are rude. I will continue to never shop there.
As always it was a wonderful stay for the holiday weekend! This review is for the staff and the outstanding service and attention to customers they provide. Made the stay really feel comfortable through the confidence we were well taken care of while away from home.
The Bellagio is just a beautiful quintessential Las Vegas hotel... It conjures up images from Ocean's Eleven and that certain something that can only be explained as VEGAS. I've walked in the hotel many times but had never stayed but my friends had a lake view 1-bedroom suite on the 29th floor that was awesome. Besides being front & center for the Bellagio fountain show, you can program the TV to sync up with the music that's accompanying the water show outside. It had been years seen I've seen the water show and seeing it from that perspective was great. . . The room had a sizeable bedroom area with full master bath and spa/sauna room, jacuzzi tub and the living room had a good sized couch, 4-seat table and it's own bathroom. The decor was more modern than what I expected but it still had that classic Bellagio flavor. What was awesomealso that my friends pointed out is that it had it's own sorta-private (not advertised) elevator bank. That was sweet... It was like a secret passage. Nicely decorated at the lobby with what was like a nice sitting area and the ever present fresh flowers that can be found all over the beautiful grounds of the Bellagio.. . Definitely gonna stay here one day. Hopefully, a lake view... Ha! Make sure you check out the gardens, fountain show, art installation above registration (so beautiful & full of color), casino, shops, etc.
Internet connection is the worst that I have experience at any hotel.  I came here for Memorial Day Weekend and unfortunately for me I had homework that needed to be submitted by midnight Sunday.  I first tried to connect in the room and it took over 15 minutes to get a connection.  The next day I went down to the lobby to work and I couldn't get connected no matter what I tried.  I eventually called the technical support desk and he finally assigned my IP addressed.  Later that night I tried to sign in from the room again and I couldn't.  I called the tech desk yet again and he had to assign my IP addressed.  I asked him why I was having so many problems and he told me the service provided sucks.  If it is so bad - they might want to consider another provider.  Note to self NEVER get COX Communications for anything.  This is NOT the experience that I expect to have at the Bellagio.  Marriott Courtyard has better internet.
The botanic garden - one of my favorite place to visit. They change the scene once in a while so every time I go, it's different. I even try to visit during both day time and night time, so that I see the work of lights. . . Room - decent and classy. I like their bed.. . "O" show - I have only watched two Cirque shows and the other one is "KA". They are probably the top two Cirque shows and both are really good. But if you have a choice, watch "KA".. . Jean Philipe Chocolate - I love their dark Chocolate. . . Fountain show - one of my favorite.

Fancy Smancy! Decadence! Love it! I could spend my whole Vegas weekend hanging out in the Bellagio. They host my favorite show, "O" and have great shopping. All of the staff bend over backwards to accommodate guests. I felt like a million bucks just hanging out there. If you are wanting to impress yourself with Vegas-style class, this is the place to go.
I've been to the Bellagio many times, and I have to say it's one of the better casino/hotel combos on the strip. The standard rooms are not huge, but you can snag one with a really great view and your location on the strip is one of the best. The Bellagio has beautiful decor, and features some decent sightseeing with the Bellagio fountains and the Botanical Garden. I lived in Las Vegas for 5 and a half years, and for some reason, the fountains just never get old.
I learned on my recent stay that I am getting old, or that I expect better service than Las Vegas mass market gives.  . . The room overlooking the fountain was nice, but noisy on the weekend until 4am when the club closed.  Our flight was cancelled due to weather, and I called down to extend our stay.  I was on hold four forty-five minutes.  Then walked down to the front desk which, in Bellagio's defense was very busy.  I ended up calling another property, and we just packed and checked out instead.  . . I feel like no matter how large you are if you don't want my business, then I'll be glad to take it somewhere that does.
