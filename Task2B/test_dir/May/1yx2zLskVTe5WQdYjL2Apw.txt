Don't assume because we're Hispanic we won't tip good! Got bad service... Won't be going back
You can never go wrong with the country fried skillet. Great food and egg-cellent service!! Our server Amanda was great and always had a smile on her face. Will be back soon
Big portion of food and it's delicious.  Great service!
Took my daughters and her friends here for a breakfast birthday... Carole Ann was our waitress she went out of her way to make our visit awesome from singing happy birthday to my youngest daughter to recommending the two younger one share a meal because it's soo much food... Thank you again we will return soon .. ;-)
What a nice place, great staff my waitress Lindsey was very nice.  Always a treat to get a perfectly cooked sunny side egg, and the hash wasn't too bad either.
Searching for a breakfast joint, we took these reviews to heart and checked out Egg & I.  We were ANYthing but disappointed.  The coffee/toast/butter aroma wafting throughout the restaurant was inviting in itself.  Our terrific server, Lindsey, volunteered I could have a 1/2 order of anything, as I was not up to 4 eggs.  I chose the chili rellenos omelette - PERFECT - and a 1/2 order was more than I could handle!  My husband had the bandit scramble - DELICIOUS.  Loved that a carafe of coffee was left on my table, so I could serve myself when I wanted more.  Loved that the cost was less than a hotel buffet -- and I didn't have to serve myself!  It is now our FAVE.
So I was in Vegas a couple of weeks ago and had a business meeting with a partner that wanted breakfast.  We made our way to Egg & I.  It's a bit small and the wait a bit longer that I'm used to ... and it's definitely away from the strip ... but it was all worth it.  I really enjoyed the food.
This place makes some of the best omelets I have ever eaten!  They are huge too, a 4 egg omelet stuffed with everything imaginable. The staff is very cheerful and attentive.
Food was super good, had a very good waitress, very polite, and generous. First time going, definitely get the banana muffin
First, no cream for my coffee. They didn't ask or bring. Checked menu on line before we went, but this location did not have the crabcake benny. My daughter ordered a coke, they brought diet. Yuck! Food came but no forks to eat it with. I got the veggie Benny. Too much lemon in the hollandaise. Probably would have been great with the crabcakes. My daughter got the buttermilk pancakes. Chewy?  And they said that can happen when you add syrup. Really? Doesn't happen at I HOP. The manager was very concerned we didn't like our meal and took off the pancakes since they weren't eaten. The only reason I gave 2 stars. We did have 2 servers, and the 2nd was better,  but I won't be back.
Such an amazing place for brunch! Call ahead and ask if there is a wait just because when we got there, there was quite a line. Waited for about 15-20 mins, not bad for a Sunday, specially for Mother's Day. . . Ambiance is a homey relaxed vibe. They serve a variety of eggs, pancakes and chilis. They have a lot of options and vegetarians too so check out the menu! . . Price is about comparable to Denny's or IHOP. . . I ordered chile relleno omelet with banana but bread and the hubby got 'the works,' with toast. We enjoyed our food and both finished it in no time. . . Will definitely come back. . . Our server Erin is very upbeat and personable, made our dining experience a little extra special!
This is my second time eating here. Both experiences where exceptionally pleasant. Shout out to our server Lindsey. You were great.
We decided to try something other than IHOP - and, we're really glad we did! Food was fantastic - and, the service made it a perfect breakfast! AMANDA was very pleasant, attentive & we loved her suggestions.....We'll definitely be back!
Best breakfast place I've ever been to! I'm visiting Vegas from Hawaii and travel a lot so have tried a lot of different places. But this has seriously got to be the best! . . Our server was awesome, service was fast friendly and she cracked some jokes with us too! She provided great recommendations to the menu and was quick on the refills.. . I ordered the chicken fried steak. It was amazing! The muffin that gets offered with the meal is a must! It was delicious! . . The atmosphere of this place is just perfect. It has a diner feel, like a real diner feel, not some IHOP or Denny's crap. At the end of our meal, we got coffee and the served left us with a refill pitcher since we were drinking it so fast. Even though we were just drinking coffee and done eating, our server still engaged in conversation, joked around and stopped by. She got a HUGE tip to say the least.. . This place is the bomb!
The blackened prime rib benny is perfection!
Good food, great selection, excellent prices and phenomenal customer service. . . Our server Bree was charming, helpful and attentive. . . Girlfriend got breakfast, I had lunch.   Huge portions. . . The Only reason I can't give five stars is they didn't serve real 100% maple syrup. Nobody gets five stars for breakfast with "table syrup". . But we will definitely be back.  My syrup snob GF will just have to bring her own.
MY FAVORITE BREAKFAST SPOT ON THE PLANET!!!. . Okay, maybe a little extreme, but you get my drift. I LOVE eating here. The staff is ALWAYS helpful, the food is always great, and the Chile Relleno Omelet is the bomb.com. PLUS --- the coffee is strong - its the perfect place to take visitors to a local Vegas spot, or just for your regular hangover cure - this place will do the trick JUST FINE, trust me, I know from experience lol
Awesome! Huge selections! Food was delicious. Banana muffins are the best. Stacy was are server and she went above and beyond in service. 5 stars service
Wonderful friendly staff and nice ambience. However, I ordered their homemade corned beef hash. It wasn't bad but it was pretty mushy. It was not even the least bit chewy. I should have questioned it when it was dropped in front of me but I normally eat my first meal of the day around 6am. It was 12 noon and I'd not yet eaten so I just ate it. 1/2 way through I realized that this was not anything close to traditional corned beef hash, especially of the homemade variety. Homemade hash to me is chunks of fresh cooked corned beef and an equal amount of potatoes, all mixed not pureed together. . . I can't fault the staff as I said above. They do a great job of making everyone feel welcome. And I could tell people around me were enjoying their meal. I would love to give them a better rating but this ain't my mama's hash.
Food was fantastic. The portiins are VERY filling. Amanda was our server and she was so sweet and helpful. We were a large party including 2 crabby seniors and a fussy baby and she made sure that everyone was well taken care of.
Came back a month later and had an awesome time! Place was packed but got sat right away, our server was Erin, aka freakin awesome! For was awesome just like I remembered. Country fried steak was crispy, gravy was perfectly seasoned! The banana muffin was great too. . . For some reason, this places coffee hits the spot. And they give a bowl of French vanilla creamers! Awesome! My partner in crime had the corned beef hash and she said it was delicious! . . Erin was always right there refilling waters and left a coffee thermos at our table. Bonus points! . . Bottom line is that if you're on Vegas, you have to eat here for breakfast. It is awesome! And Erin is the bomb!
Ive had this place several times, take out and dine in!! My best experiences are truly dine in! Mashed potato & cinni chilli omlette to die for!!! I love this location best servers have to be alyssa and bree!! Dont mind waiting as the food and service always wows me!
The food portions were rather large, which is a good thing but the quality or taste needs to be turned up a notch. I was really disappointed with the Cashew pancakes. Service was great as well, however I rate due to the taste because service is only relevant to the individual servers. I would rather go to Hash House or Mr. Mamas!
The works omelette was delicious. Very fresh food and Lindsey was helpful and prompt. Good dining experience, would come back again.
Liliana provided excellent service for our breakfast visit. My wife had the classic breakfast and said the bacon was very good. I had a special, the Hobo Scramble, which was exactly what the description said and really hit the spot. Their potatoes are deliciously seasoned. We both also had their tasty sourdough toast. Had already had coffee so can't speak to that but the iced tea was good. It was Memorial Day so there was a pretty good line but it moved quickly, only about a 15 minute wait. Hostesses were great, too!
Hearty breakfast where locals go. It's got a country-side vibe. Relatively cheap and large portions. Service was really quick, in and out in 30 mins. Great place to go if you're in Vegas and on a budget or if you don't wanna wait 1.5 hours for a trendy brunch place.. . Recommend: omelettes are okay, get a skillet. Crappy OJ is $3.25!
This place was great! It is not located in a hotel so I didn't have to walk through a maze to get there.  A little bit off the strip but that's what I liked about it.  There was a ten minute wait but that's how I knew it was going to be good, and it was completely worth it.  I had a skilled and banana nut muffin.  My girlfriend had their eggs "benny".  All was exceptional.  Wait staff was great.
