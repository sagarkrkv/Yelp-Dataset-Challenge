Ambience & service are great~food is okay. I got the burger, which at $17, was the cheapest option. It was dry & flavorless.The fries were limp shoestrings seasoned w/ too much salt. The salad was a joke. Two pickles and coleslaw, yes coleslaw, on two pieces of romaine.
Wonderful food and service. Let me start off with the wait staff, they were very professional, very attentive, and well trained.  My husband and I split a salad and pizza. They divided the salad into two, which was unexpected and we really appreciated it. We would make sure we ate here again on our next trip.
I ordered a salmon dish with asparagus and other vegetables. There was nothing wrong with the quality of the food, but it literally took me 30 seconds to eat because the portion size was so small. I really do not like spending $26 on a dish that doesn't come close to filling me up. We had to go eat somewhere else afterwards since we were still hungry.
First spot I landed at when arriving in Vegas after checking into the MGM. It was late, and I was famished but didn't want something heavy. I ordered the tuna tartare and it was exactly what I needed. Small, fresh, just enough food to hold me to the next day and allow me to sleep without indigestion. Success! Had a few rounds of drinks with colleagues. Wine was good. Champagne was delicious. . . We ate at Craftsteak the night after and everyone who ordered beef said Wolfgang's steaks were better. . . Also, a lot of restaurants closed early, but this was still going strong. Highly recommend!
Really great food! Prices are not bar prices so don't be fooled. Calamari is really good and they have nice drinks. Crab cakes look beyond delicious!
Expected better.  Service was horrible.  People around us, who arrived after us were served first.  I'm on vacation so I'm not in a hurry, but an acknowledgment and an apology would have been nice.  Food was decent.  Nothing to rave about.  Especially the fact that we were right by the side of the casino and had to smell cigar smoke throughout dinner.  BARF!
I can sum up my experience like women's comparing of guy's units: falling short in expectations..Yeah sorry, that's all that came to mind.. . I tried the world renowned blue cheese chips and in my view the salt in there was so overpowering that it did make it a bit unpleasant to get down and it didn't help either that they lost heat pretty quick. I did like the water if that counts?. . Entree wise since it was lunch I went with a pizza and although I don't remember what I had exactly I do remember the taste and alas it tasted just like the name: a puck. Well maybe not that far, but it by no means has me coming back for more at all.
During my last trip to Vegas on biz back on April I arrived after midnight and checked into the MGM Grand. After I dropped off my luggage in the room I ran down to play some blackjack for an hour or so. At that point I was ravenous and needed a bite to eat. This casino is huge but many spots to eat at were already closed for the night. I wandered over to Wolfgang Puck and it was still open. . . Open until 6 am so its a life saver when drunk and hangry! . . Pretty decent cheeseburger here. Big and filling. Fries are shoestring style and just ok. A few craft beers on tap about six or so such as Full Sail Amber.. . Plenty of seating surrounding the floor, and a nice bar area I sat at. The bartender on duty that night was attentive enough and got me my food and drink pretty quickly. Overall, no real complaints here, but a bit on the pricey side. It is in a casino after all. Not a bad spot to grab a meal, especially in the middle of the night when on a gambling bender.
This restaurant is right in the middle of the slots at MGM, so if you are looking for something more intimate go elsewhere. The decor was really slick and well designed. I had the margarita pizza which was cooked really well and had great wood fire taste. Service was quick and efficient.
Every time we come to vegas, we never fail to stop by this joint. It's awesome for efficient service and is open till the wee hours of the night :) . . This time we had the... . 1. tuna tartare - which was raw tuna mixed with spicy mayo, a little bit of teriyaki sauce (as far as my tastebuds could tell) and topped with avocado. Almost like a sushi without the rice! It was delicious! The crispy golden wanton chips were the perfect companion for this dish. Too bad we only had 4 chips!!! Unlike at Pacific Catch where they give you more than you can count! . . 2. Crab cakes - The waiter was very accommodating. Even though crab cakes was not on the menu for the evening he put in a special request for us. They were delicious! . . . 3. Lastly, dessert - chocolate beignets -  my favorite!!! Except this time, they didn't have chocolate, instead they had regular beignets stuff with light citrus tasting custard. It was even better than the chocolate beignets! Chocolate beignets with chocolate dip can get a little excessive and I could never eat more than 3. However, regular beignet felt much lighter in comparison and I could easily waffle down 4 with  a nice not-too-sweet caramel toffee dip.
Loved this place. Service was fantastic which is hard to come by in Vegas. . Ordered the calamari-3 stars (just a tad overxooked). Truffle blue cheese chips-5 stars!  So good and flavorful, not as heavy as I would have thought.. Chicken salad-5 stars. This salad is huge and is so filling. Candied cashews, huge chunks of chicken, wontons, cilantro, plus much more. This salad has an amazing dressing with a wasabi flavor giving it a kick.. Would definitely eat here again.
We had the home made pasta with veggies and the flat iron steak. It was nothing out of the ordinary. Noisy because it is open to the casino area.
The food and service were both wonderful here! I've been to Vegas twice and eaten at this restaurant three times. The pizza was probably my least favorite but the BLT, chicken salad sandwich, and chicken noodle soup were all top notch. I would recommend this restaurant at the MGM!
Wolfgang Pucks is one of my favorite chain restaurant so I came here with expectations that this would meet their standards. Was here on a Weekday lunch. Service was decent in effort, but I could tell that most were light on experience. Maybe the rookie staff gets weekday lunches. Busboy, please don't ask me every 5 minutes if I'm done with my meal while reaching for my plate; the fact that I'm still eating is a cue that I'm not.. . The restaurant is clean and has nice decor. We ordered the "Tempura Battered Fish". It was not tempura battered, definitely beer battered. Also, the fish was so small and the batter so much that I felt like I was eating batter only plus it was greasy. The ice tea was good though and the appetizer that I got which was the Tartare was okay. Plenty of good places in Vegas. Won't be coming back here.
Service was good. Food average but overpriced. The pizza was not tasty and exciting and the side spinach tasted like it had too much flower. The shrimp diavolo was ok and Mac and Cheese was sweet, thick and blend. Would not go back.
