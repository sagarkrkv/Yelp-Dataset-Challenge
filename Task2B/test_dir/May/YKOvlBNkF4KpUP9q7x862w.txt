The Mission is in Old Scottsdale, a nice area for good restaurants and shopping.  . . We went on a Sunday early afternoon for brunch.  It was busy but we were able to find a table in the bar area (first come, first served).  Otherwise, if you want a table, I'd suggest making reservations (we had one for dinner originally and times went quickly...we called a week in advance and the best we could get was 6PM).. . Brunch is a choice of the regular menu, which is small but has some good dishes, or an All-You-Can-Eat taco bar, which is done well.  They have someone carving beef and pork.  They put it on a small, soft tortilla for you, and you add your own toppings.  Very good, reasonable price (think it was $16).  They also offer table side Guacamole, made to your preferences.. . Overall, very enjoyable.  Might give it a 5-star if it were in another location, but with the competition in that area, there are a few that are slightly better.
I've eaten dinner before here and always loved it. Recently, I took my mother here and met some friends for brunch. We had an absolutely wonderful meal and experience. Our waitress was a sweetheart and very attentive. The Bloody Marys were out of this world and the guacamole and chips were incredible. I think I made the wrong choice in my meal because it had an over easy egg, which I don't like, but other than that it was a fantastic meal, loved the patio and we will definitely return not only for dinner now, but for brunch as well.
I have mixed feelings about this place. The setting could be called warm and romantic and the main attraction is the patio, which is hard to secure, so you will end up sitting in the loud inside area. . I am not sure why the place is so popular. If you call, they are usually fully booked, but if you just walk in, there is a big chance you would be seated within 10 minutes. . The decor is a mix of Latin and American steakhouse and doesn't have a unique identity in my opinion. It would definitely need a makeover to stay popular, given all the cool places that are popping up in the old town.. As for the food; I have been there three times already and the experience has always been average. Based on my last experience, I don't think I would go back. Most of our hot appetizers came late and cold. The taco dishes were mediocre and there were not enough staff to attend to our demanding party.
I hate to give 3 stars but service was a joke. The tacos we ordered were terrible. I will say the guacamole made at your table remains the same and still some well. The duck empanada was perfect. The fried bananas for Dessert was fine. Honestly, I won't be back for a long time. Not worth it to me. Too bad
This restaurant is truly a gem that you cannot pass up!! My husband and I have been coming for years and although we cannot come very often because it is not close to our home, we are never disappointed when we make the drive! . . We started with the tostadas which are to die for! There are so many flavors and textures in this dish that wow you. A little on the spicy side, but so good!. . We then had the cubano torta and the chicken tacos. Both were amazing!!. . The waitstaff is attentive and knowledgable, even on tough questions like is the cheese pasteurized. . . Always enjoy our meals here! Just don't sit out back, too many flies in the back for some reason.
Amazing guacamole, service and atmosphere!  I will be back.
My husband has been raving about this place, so we went there for lunch.  We started with their guacamole, made fresh right at the table.  It was incredible.  They come to your table with a cart loaded with bowls of ingredients and you can choose what to add to your guacamole.  I've never had anything so delicious!  Wow!  Their chips were also the best I've had in any restaurant anywhere!  We each ordered the tacos.  I had the pork shoulder tacos, which were incredible.  My husband ordered the barbacoa tacos.  He said they were good, but we swapped one taco and he liked the pork shoulder better.  I also had one of their "famous margaritas" and it was really tasty!  It was just the right strength, not too weak, not too strong.  We will definitely be going back. My only complaint was it's SO hot sitting outside on the patio, but I'm from Seattle, so not used to the heat.  It was like a sauna, so if you're really sensitive to heat, stay inside if you can.  . . Definitely five star, will definitely be back.
The food was amazing, the kind which makes you close your eyes & smile. I had the grilled chicken tacos with a side dish of papa's y chorizo then we tried huge tequila shots which I believe are a house special we were told it is DIAMOND filtered "OOOO fancy" whatever they do it was smooth! Warm and chilled (So we had a couple) haha. We were a party of 3 we all tried different dishes and all enjoyed.
Great for groups on the patio! Tableside guacamole is a must. Service is great and the food is uniquely beautiful and delicious. I chose this place for a work group and all loved it!
The Mission has been a favorite of mine since it opened.  I had my Farewell to Scottsdale, Arizona brunch on April 27th, and it was very disappointing.  After we were seated at 11 a.m.,  ordered drinks, and were given menus; the waitress advised us upon taking our order that their fryer was broken, and wouldn't be repaired anytime soon, or at least while we were dining.  Really problematic for our party, as we were looking forward to splitting their fabulous french fries.  There was a rather dismissive apology by the waitress, then she advised us that any of the entrees that would normally require a fryer could be prepared as grilled. I really couldn't think of what that was on the menu, but I ended up ordering a couple of "safe" appetizers to split, and left disappointed. We also ordered chips and guacamole, and the chips were either from another establishment or yesterday's as they were stale and uninviting.  Not what you would want to pair with $12 tableside guac.   It was even more entertaining to watch the very large touristy family next to us who wandered in with 7 kids under the age of 12.  There was nada on the menu for these little ones to eat except a quesadilla I guess.  After they ordered, their waiter came back to their table to let them know that their whiny kids would be ordering something else besides french fries and empanadas.  Sort of a metaphor for me and Scottsdale as a whole, glad to be back in Cali.
Second time was awful service. Not courteous, not helpful. The food was rushed out and we were not offered  a second drink -- come on, I'm  paying!! Won't go back anytime soon.
Great experience.  Lots of onstreet parking available and great location.. . I went here with my fiancee and we shared the tableside Guacamole and the Pork Shoulder Tacos.  I would find it hard to not get the same thing - they were both absolutely delicious!  Portions were large but not obesity sized.  For dessert we had the. Expresso Churros, which were awesome as well.  We wouldn't have gotten it normally because we were so full, but they gave it to us for free since we were celebrating a special occasion.. . I thought the service was a little slow to get to us (about 6-7 minutes) initially, but once he did, the service was excellent.  That was the only blemish.  If I could give 4.5 starts, I would.  We will definitely be back next time we are in Phoenix.
The food and service were great. However, the music mix actually ruined the dining experience. Seriously. Change the music.
High quality good.  Very flavorful. Lights were very dim so bring a flashlight to see your menu and food.
Outstanding food and drinks.
Amazing guacamole - get it with ghost pepper. Pork belly app - ask for it with tortillas for mini tacos. Drink tequila from the calacas bottle. She's worth it.
Organic Margaritas?  That means I drink all I want and I'm being healthy.  I have had mahi mahi tacos all across this land and they have hit it out of the park.  The steak tacos came in a close second.  All in all this is the real deal, I'm still thinking about those drinks and that meal.  The foodie knows.
My wife and I decided to hit this place for dinner on our last night staying in AZ after an amazing 2 week vacation.  Its menu and good reviews drew us in immediately.  Old Town Scottsdale is also such a great fun place, we just had to go back to have our last hurrah there.. . After not being able to make a reservation as it was completely booked, we were pleasantly surprised when the hostess found us a table for two just as walk ins.. . We ordered a couple of beers and decided to get the two appetizers that grabbed us the most.  The Duck Carnita Empanada and the Pazole.  When my wife got the empanada, she immediately realized there  was no way she could eat that then an entree after it.  It was a very large portion and rich/heavy.  I didn't mind that so we switched and she took the pazole.  After a few spoonfuls she told me it was very salty.  I was surprised because we are salt fiends and never complain about saltiness.  I took a few spoons and yes, it was extremely salty.  Inedible salty.  If you have ever had Kalua pork at a luau, you would know that it is very salty, but in a pleasant way.  This was way more salty than that.  We told the server and he immediately said they would take it off the bill.  Considering the reputation, I would have thought they would offer a free drink or desert, but that is ok.  Anyway, my empanada was good, just very filling, and unfortunately I ordered the Duck Confit for dinner, so double rich duck dishes.  My wife got the snapper which  was extremely good and made up for the salty pazole.  I was relieved.  I thought maybe we hit a place that was all hype, but no, this place is legit and very good. They just probably had one of those moments where someone in the kitchen didn't taste before sending out the dish.  I will never hold that against a restaurant the first time.. . We were too full for desert, so that was it.  The place was super busy, hip, and dimly lit, which we like.  Service was very good.  Dammit though, I was really looking forward to my 2nd ever bowl of Pazole.  My first was while visiting AZ last year and I had been craving it since.. . We will be going back to The Mission as it has a very interesting menu that deserves investigating further.  Plus it's a fun place, albeit pricey.
Good Mexican food but if your Mexican u can easily make it at home for half the price. I ordered a plate of chilaquiles was $12 Homemade guacamole n chip was good but small portion.. Customer service n employee are Great !! . Good authentic flavors and salsas
While the food was excellent, the service was poor.  It took an hour for the waiter to take our order.  Chips and salsa were gratis.  When a delicious corn side dish was placed on the table, we assumed it was also free. We were not asked if we would like the corn.  It was placed there and we were charged for it.   A dessert was also brought out without them asking us.  We were also charged for that dessert.  That is just not the right to do that.
Fantastic day! My suggestion; Go in on a Sunday, around 4pm. The bar was pretty packed at this time of day, but the restaurant was empty.   Sit down in the restaurant area.  It is fun to watch the restaurant transition from a whimsical  Sunday Fun-day type atmosphere to an exotic and demure nightlife Restaurant.  Around 5pm, they begin to dim all of those gorgeous chandy's and close the thick shutters. Around 5:30pm, they start lighting and dispersing LOTS of little tiny votive candles to all the tables and wall mounted candelabras.   The restaurant is starting to fill little by little and the noise level goes from quiet to loud and bustling. The day shift is transitioning to night shift and the waiters are polishing their tables and preparing for a packed house. ( The restaurant is completely booked for dinner reservations ) The menu at this time of day is very simple as they are preparing for dinner.  But the simplicity of this menu makes it easy to order light hearted items.  The filet skewers and shrimp skewers are delicious.  Order the table side guacamole!! It is fantastic !  The bread pudding was delicious, but priced $2 cheaper on the menu than we were charged on our bill.  We were also charged for a chicken skewer $12, that we did not order.  We had to bring this to our waitress's attention after we received the bill. Good thing I doubled checked the bill as my husband didn't even look at it and just plopped his credit card down.  When I mentioned the discrepancy of pricing to the waitress. She took off the chicken skewer, but not the $2 additional charge for the bread pudding. We didn't push it, because who wants to be a bitch over $2, but just check your bill before you pay.  Overall, I loved they whole experience and I can't wait to go back!!!   Oh! I posted a picture of the bread pudding and the picture looks disgusting. Tried to delete the picture and I don't know how.  The bread pudding is delicious, even though the picture I took looks like bile topped with ice cream and bed bugs.
We went back for some more of the table side guacamole and had some the spicy chicken tacos - they were so good!  Then we went back again the next day and had the same thing...soooooo good.  The service redeemed itself, so I upped the review to 5 stars.  We will be eating their multiple times whenever we are back in Phoenix.
Steak tacos LEGIT! Guac is amazing. Pumpkin brea pudding for dessert is  MUST!
Don't get me wrong, as I mentioned last time, the servers and the quality of the food are top-notch.  However, this is the second time we have visited the Mission and its the second time we have been treated VERY poorly by the host-staff, specifically a man with dark hair in a hip button-down shirt.  He stands at the desk prepared to seat people, but if you don't look the "Scottsdale" part, he is condescending and rude.  We decided to give it a second chance BECAUSE the food was so good the first time, but we will not visit again.  The host left a foul taste in our mouths one last time.
The ambiance is nice, the food is decent, portions are small.  I think the prices are a little on the high end for what you get.  I took a couple of girlfriends there who were in from out of town and they thought is was an okay place....so it deserves an ok review rating.
Not what I expected. Especially after all the hype. I ate nothing that I could not have prepared at home for a fraction of the price. Dark, noisy: noise due to music too loud & people talking louder to be heard. Quite the din, because it is a small space. . . Needed my phone flashlight to see the menu. Too dark is not for me. This does nothing for the ambience and gives me a feeling that there is something to hide. Perhaps $12 guacamole. That's one expensive avocado! . . I only ordered a salad and the "tacos". Mahi mahi that was mehi meh. The only peeps at my table who ordered entrees, were my two brothers. Meat eaters. They said their chorizo whateveritwas was good. Nothing on the plate as a side. I guess I just don't get it. Rent must be really high, and of course it is a "cool" location. So now I've tried it, but it was completely unmemorable. . . If you like to sit in the dark, eat expensive and just "ok" food because you're a Scottsdale hipster, then this is the place for you. I was just pleased to have exited the loud "tomb" when all was said & done. It's just no big deal.
The Mission has been a place that I have always wanted to go to. It's in the area of town that I'm always in. . . I had tried twice to make reservations and I couldn't get a spot. It made me want to go even more. Finally I was able to get in and have dinner.. . When we walked in the place was beautiful. Dim lighting a buzz of lively chatter and happy people. We were promptly shown to our seats. It wasas we had imagined. When we sat down we waited for about 5 mins until our waitress came to take our drink order. We put our drink orders and appetizer orders in. We got the Duck Confite  and Faus Gras Empanadas. It was so good. Oh man it was delicious. After about 15 mins I started to worry about why our waitress had not come to take our order. I had finished my drink and didn't get a water refill. By this time I was frustrated. It was until 38 mins later did our waitress come back to take our order. I was livid but she came with a bit of an attitude. I had noticed it in the beginning and now it was apparent that she was acting as if she didn't want to be there and we were an inconvenience. It started to get warm, very warm. She came back and asked us if we needed anything else and before we could answer she walked off. The drink I had ordered was good but the Margarita we had ordered wasn't the one we ordered and when we politely asked her to get the right drink we ordered she rudely replied "I don't understand, that's what you ordered, *rolled her eyes* well what else would you like?"  We replied with "um well I'll just have a classic margarita, no salt on the rim" and she replied with "are you sure?" Which then I answered "oh we are sure sweetheart, we would rather not wait 39 mins to receive our drinks" the food was good but small small. Portions. The margarita we received had a salt rim and was not worth the $13 charged. We were also charged the drink we asked to not be charged for bc we didn't order it. . . When we told her that our drink had that charge she replied with "well I guess I can go take that off" she replied with a "nevermind" we paid and left. . . I was extremely disappointed and upset and didn't enjoy my time at all. It was a terrible experience and I do not want to return. The Mission is great looking but staff needed more training. Maybejust her. I was sad.
