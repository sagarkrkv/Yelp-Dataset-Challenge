Horrible service, orderred food and got kicked out by scrawny manager that insisted on calling security and when asked why when one of our group members put their head down for being tired he ego tripped and wanted to fight but had security escort us cuz he was not man enough.... Unprofessional place. Go down the street one intersection over by the 15 to the other 24/7 pho place (tons better)The manager here is always rude and power trips. Will not return.
I swear to god I will never ever return to this place,  found a roach in the pho after I finished the soup, I told the server,but he didn't do anything about it, very bad attitude . I don't understand why the owner keep a such bad server working with them.
usually go to other 24 hour pho spot on spring mountain down the road( pho little saigon) late night but the people i was with pushed me into trying this place out.  . . the place looks nice but first impression of having to wait 10 minutes to be seated with a bunch of open tables cause the host was to busy flirting with the girls.  then it took another ten minutes for someone to even come by and take our order.  the food showed up pretty quick but easily sub par.  Rude stand offish attitudes from all the workers and manager.  People seem to just love this place cause they server large portions of poor soup all night long.  Im going to stick with my regular spot down the road.
Haven't been to this place for a while but finally decided to eat here since this place is open 24/hrs. The host was friendly but after being seated we waited about 5min to have our waters served and another 10min for someone to take our orders.. The main person I was concerned about every time I come with friends is the guy that is always at the register. He is very rude and gives you a smug look every time we ask if we can split our checks. He never speaks to you and is always in a rush to get your money so you and your party can leave.. No "have a good night" or a simple "bye". Food was mediocre and unpleasant and found a piece of plastic wrap in my food. Never coming here again.
First time here. The wait was not too bad. The hostess was super nice. But it seemed like the waiter took forever to come by and get our order. When he finally did come, he was obviously impatient and started tapping his foot. The food came out slower than anticipated for a pho place. Food was ok. Lettuce wraps were a little burnt. I may give it one more chance and order something different. Soups weren't anything spectacular. I'll stick to Pho So 1 for my pho fix.
Average run of the mill ehh Pho place. . Decor: nice clean interior. . Pho is always the best hangover cure, however this place is an ehh.. . The broth wasn't as flavorful and I felt like they were super stingy on the meat and veggies.. One plate of veggies for 12 bowls? Really. =[ The plate of meat had 5 pieces all about half of a baseball size of the thawed frozen cut meat.. . Overall - there are plenty of other Pho places that are better. Skip this one.
The broth is delicious. The sides are delicious. The late hours are awesome. I can have Pho any time of the day! The service is fast and friendly. I keep going back and will continue to as long as I'm in Vegas. I recommend anyone visiting to definitely check it out :)
Awesome pho and super busy restaurant!  It's so hard to find good pho anywhere, and this place is amazing.  The soup was minty, the meat was excellent, and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  We also got the bun cha gio thit nuong, and the meat was a bit dry but overall, the dish was pretty good.  I would only get pho the next time I come, as this place left me gave me a great impression.  The service is pretty fast and friendly, so we'll be coming back here during our next Vegas trip! :)
a must go to spot after a weekend of drinking!  the server is def funny.. came over and started to ask if we were hung over.. the food was ok.. of course sgv is better.. it's is def expensive..
the service here is like shit. . mat thang nao thang nay nhu cai lon cua con di me no .
I enjoy the convenience of a 24 hour pho place. Service is always okay but the food has never disappointed me.
My only complaint is sometimes the line is too long to wait.   I've been twice now and live it!  Excellent food, good service,  friendly staff (mostly).
Pho = the ultimate hangover food.. . This spot is quickly becoming one of my regular stops for lunch either the last day of a weekend in Vegas or just because in Vegas. The restaurant looks clean and the food is good. I can't really say for the other things and I'm not sure if it's because of a long night out, but I'm venturing to say this is one of my favorite pho restaurants I've been to. . . Keep in mind this place gets busy quick so bigger parties may have to wait a bit. Biggest downside though is it's off the strip so having a car is ideal.
Shopping center isn't all that attractive but inside this place is very nice. Excellent service. Kept my water full all the time. Lettuce wraps were mediocre. Beef Pho was excellent. Broth was amazing. Add a few jalapenos for spice. A lot of food. You don't need an appetizer.
Unbelievable. This place is a joke! The employees and manager are beyond ridiculous. . . Here is the story. My mother and I had gone right now and had ordered some food and one of the many foods we ordered was Chicken Pad Thai. When our dish came out and we ate couple chopstick full & looked at this so called "chicken" that was thinly sliced, chewy and what seemed and look like fat attached was simply "pork". . . Like any customers would, we called over our waiter, he took it back unsure as well than ANOTHER waiter aggressively came back with the dish and claimed it was chicken. We argued about this for several mins & because we didn't want to make a bigger scene we told him to take the dish back. . . NOW, this next part gets better. As we continue to eat our rest of the food, the waiter and his other employees gather around near by we were sitting and have the nerves to talk about our situation and laugh about it. So, as a customer I was furious. Asked for the manager to let him be aware of his employees behavior. Of course -_- manager isn't any better with his behavior so possibly that's why his employees aren't any better either -_- so anyways, manager comes to our table, not making any eye contact with me and fights for his employees (which is understandable defending his employees). Finally got an apology and ended the conversation. . . This gets even better, once the check arrives, we were charged for Chicken Pad Thai (in most case in other restaurants, the dish is taken off the check) so we only paid for what we only ate and with that kind of a crappy service, we didn't leave tip. As we were leaving, the manager came out to our car and told us we didn't pay enough. This is how the conversation went:. . Manager: "you didn't pay enough!". Me: "no, we paid for what we ate.". Manager: "shut up!". . So at this point, I was beyond furious and got out of our car and went up to him and he had the nerve to say he didn't tell me to shut up. So now I'm apparently gone crazy and hearing things -_- then he aggressively argues with me that I didn't pay enough, so I had to RE-EXPLAIN to him that we ONLY paid for what we actually ate and not what was taken back (since we didn't eat it!). . . This is where he failed miserably as a manager...not only did he verbally fight back, tell me to shut up, but he had his biggest nerves to tell me my service was unwanted there and for me to "go to hell". . . Uhm, are you serious right now?! How in the world can a restaurant manager say all that to a customer?????!!!!!! My mind was so blown away. Un-freaking-believe-able! For sure NEVER going back there and it is such a disappointment cause I been going there for many years now. I seriously think they are so full of it!     . . This doesn't even deserve a (1) star but I have to give something to leave a review...FML -_-
Good pho, less than average customer service. I like that it's open 24/7 ...go for lunch. Obviously get some pho ---try the grilled pork spring rolls!
Good food, quick service, clean restaurant. . . Only issue was parking, smaller spots and I drive a full size truck. It fit but tested my parking skills for sure. . . I will definitely be back!
The only Pho place I will go anymore, delicious, fast and great service. Their Spring rolls are like no other!
Love their Combination 13 Pho! Seriously best calamari in town! The tempura breading is on point! Favorite place for Pho. Service isn't the BEST but you get your food fast and its always the same (AMAZEBALLS) As far as the service, it seems as if every persona has once specific job. I.s..drinks, order, food runner, to go packer... but again, fav place in Vegas for pho!
My stomach hurts so bad as I write this review, I am definitely torching this place. . . This place is terrible! My whole family got sick after eating here. As I lay here feeling full of regret and in disbelief of how disgusting our dinner was here, my stomach is extra tender and sore and my mouth is numb and dehydrated. . . I'm full Vietnamese and this place is such a huge embarrassment and a disgrace to real authentic Vietnamese food. . . First offense - the goi cuon (shrimp and pork spring rolls/ summer rolls) were tiny and barely had any filling inside. A piece of lettuce, a tiny bit of noodles, a sliver of meat and 3 slivers of shrimp. Oh, and that so called dipping sauce was so gross! Super watered down. What a ripoff. . . Second offense - Msg was never really an issue for me and it never really caused me any problems, until I ate here. Also, my uncle is really sensitive to it and he had a lot of issues with his pho. He didn't drink any of his pho broth because it had too much MSG and by the end of dinner he started to feel sick. . . Third offense - the nuoc cham (fish sauce/dipping sauce) was so watered down, that I ended up asking them for 3 bowls for my meal - but even 3 bowls was not enough and I finally gave up. It was disgustingly bland. I was pretty much pouring sugar water onto my rice. . . Fourth offense - my pork chop was dry and the marinade was bland. The charring on the pork chop tasted artificial. . . Fifth offense - our tongue is all sorts of numb and shriveled up after eating here. I guess MSG does that to you. We're extremely weak, thirsty and dehydrated now. . . Sixth offense - the chow fun beef noodles in gravy (hu tieu xao bo) was so unappetizing and unappealing, I was in disbelief they served it to us. They overcooked the chow fun noodles so they broke up into a billion of small pieces when you tried to pick them up with chopsticks, the gravy was all watery and goopy. It was not tasty at all. . . With so many options in Vegas to get Vietnamese food late, this place is not one of them.
Used to be my favorite place,  but the last couple of times I went in were terrible.  The service was awful (I couldn't get a refill on my water,  and had to chase someone down to get my check) the portions were smaller,  and the pho was just not as good.  Very disappointing. I've switched to little saigon!
Good for a morning hangover. Good portions for a decent price. This place gets busy at night and in the morning on the weekends.  Thai Tea was disappointing though.  Lots of meat in the pho.
The food is not that great and it is the priciest vietnamese restaurant in town. The service is the worst thing. The waiters are so mean. Has No manner in customer service. Talk really rude to us when we ask some question. These people need to take a manner lesson.
Definitely not the top choice for pho during a Vegas getaway trip. I decided to try it out after hearing that it was pretty decent. WRONG. Right when we were seated, we were asked what we wanted to order FOUR TIMES within a 10 minute time period. Barely having any time to think, the manager asks after his second time, "Ready to order? There are people waiting to eat so you guys should hurry and make a selection". (He said something rude along the lines of that). They are basically just trying to get people in, take the money, and kick them out. This is definitely the worst customer service I've ever had in a restaurant. . . I ordered a #13 combination pho (the combo wasn't really a combo considering there was barely much variety in there). My friend ordered the steak rice plate, which looked slapped on without nice plating presentation. It was not worth the amount paid for the quality. . . I don't think I've ever had such a poor experience at a Vietnamese Restaurant. I see some previous complaints about the manager below and it is certain that he hasn't changed at all. What a dick. Please take this evaluation into consideration before going here to eat.
This is by far my favorite place to go for pho! The restaurant is clean & the service is great - even when they are slammed. For appetizers, you can't go wrong with the crab rangoon, calamari or egg rolls. Lately I have been changing things up & getting the wonton soup with egg noodles, it's absolutely delicious!! I highly recommend this restaurant. I know I will keep coming back!
I give the food 4.5 stars but the service sucks late night. Why be open when the clubs get out and there's no staff.
Always delicious, Pho Kim Long is our "go-to" for Vietnamese food no matter the hour of day. It is open 24 hours, and more often than not there is a short wait for a table. The salt and pepper chicken wings are a must, and their pho soups and vermicelli noodle dishes are consistently flavorful and filling. Right now they have a special appetizer of pork belly buns that are soft, sweet buns filled with BBQ pork belly, cilantro, jalapeno slices and a sriracha mayo. Divine.
This place is great & is 24/7. I love their Pot stickers, spring rolls, egg rolls and their  Luc-lac steak. Plus their plain rice noodle Pho. Yum and I've never had bad service so that's a plus and our waiter Brian was excellent.
The Mongolian beef is Amazeballs and the lettuce wrap egg rolls! A good place to eat after a long night of partying lol
Food is great, service is slow. . . Think of everything you want as ask right away when the waiter is there, who knows when he will be back. . . Food was fresh and well prepared. Good flavor combinations.  Spring rolls were great.
So I've eaten here three times now and I think three times the charm was not. I'm such a foodie that I really wanted to like this place. It felt like it kept getting worse each time I came. My tummy was hurting after the third try. I've heard such good reviews but I guess it's only good when you are super hungry and taste buds are warped from clubbing all night.
I would of gave this place either 4-5 stars if it wasn't for the mute, slow service. I must admit though, their interior designmakes this pho restaurant upscale than others. I've been to a good amount of pho restaurants here in Las Vegas and if you have too then you know that pho & drinks are served to you pretty fast.. . Now before I go on to my little rant, I must add that their pho is never a disappointment. What I always get is number 13 which is the combination pho which has a little bit of most things & the steak is flavorful. So good job Pho Kim Long for yummy pho ! But BOO for the lack of service you offer ! . . My boyfriend and I went and we ordered two #13 combination phos and I also ordered a tai tea boba. About 3 minutes later our pho is served to us but not my drink. You would of thought my drink came first, right? Well, I thought, "Oh, maybe they're still making it" so about another good 5 minutes passes by & my boba is still not served to me & I started to question my thoughts about this place. So we asked one of the waiters where my boba was and he just walked off without any acknowledgement or reassurance that it was coming. So we waited another 10 minutes and my boyfriend and I are just about done with our pho and still....no....tai tea boba. I asked another waiter, "Hi excuse me, I've been waiting for about 10 minutes for my tai tea boba now and I still haven't gotten it." & he got the job done but he didn't even apologize for the long wait. . . I got my boba just in time we paid for the check and the boba was great but ugh the service is whack. I need I add that we did go there during graveyard hours but still, you can't lack on a job especially if it runs 24/7 and stays busy.
This place used to be my goto place for pho and bun. Now, every time I go there it just plain stinks. It smells like wet rag. The service sucks, nobody checks on you, and it's too crowded. Gross. Never coming here again. Jenni pho is my go to place now. Cleaner, well decorated, and pho tastes better.
Hands down the best Pho restaurant in Las Vegas. Only complaint is the wait to get a table is sometimes really long (upwards of 30-45 minutes at times). In the end I think my complaint only plays into the quality of food they serve here. It's so good that everyone I know if willing to wait to get a nice hot bowl of their Pho. Added bonus is they're open 24/7 so you can get this delicious meal any time you want.
Always open with good broth. Definitely a good late grub after the club gets out.
