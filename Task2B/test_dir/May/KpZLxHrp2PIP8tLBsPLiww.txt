Overall, The Signature is a great hotel if you do not mind walking long distances to get to anything (casino, food, etc). However, if you are looking for something a little more in the action and lively this is definitely not the hotel for you.. . The Signature sits quite a ways back from the strip; depending on how fast you walk it is 10-20 minutes to just get into the MGM Grand. It has some amenities: fitness centre, pool for every tower, small deli-style restaurants onsite. Also, you are able to use amenities at the MGM Grand like their pool, which is much bigger. We found it was quicker to go to the Miracle Mile than the MGM for a quick bite to eat. The distance to the strip was definitely annoying if you are someone who likes walking around in Vegas.. . Parking appears to be valet only and it only takes a couple minutes to get your car. Unfortunately, you are not able to call ahead and get your carbrought up.. . Noticeably missing from The Signature are long lineups. It is a much quieter hotel than one on the strip and much less crowded. . . The rooms are nice. Not the newest, but they are large and kept in good order. There are also balconies with them. When you get a two bedroom, there is quite a bit of room with the kitchenette and ours even had a third bathroom which works well when you have people sleeping on the pull-outs. It was setup nice for 2 groups - the entryway of the suite separated each of the bedrooms with their own keycard so that if those staying in one bedroom wanted to leave early/stay later there was zero disruption/noise to the other group. It was a great setup for a group of people sharing because everyone was not crammed into one room, and you could come/go without the other group noticing/being disturbed.. . One tip is that, because these rooms can be actually owner by an individual, you can often find them on other sites (VRBO for example) where the owners rent them out. You can (or at least we did) rent them at substantially lower rates than through the hotel directly.
My hubby and I and 2 other couples stayed here 2 weekends ago.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. The spa tub and huge shower were a plus for me.  I especially loved how we were given a parking permit and pulled our car into the gates of luxury living and the valet parked our cars and brought them down whenever we needed.  . . Unfortunately, I'm only I giving 3 stars because the front desk clerk neglected to inform us our our resort credit. Therefore, when it was time to check out I see and extra $150 on my bill.  I found out it was for the "unused" resort credit.  I immediately questioned this and was told that the hotel would extend my stay for 2 hours so that I could eat and charge it to the room.  SERIOUSLY?!?!?!  Do you really think that the 2 of us can eat $150 worth of food in 2 hours as we are heading home?  After this, I was given the run around until I was able to speak with a manager.  She eventually credited me for the daily resort fees to take the place of the resort credit that I was supposed to receive.  80 something dollars was supposed to be credited back and I was to receive a confirmation email.  I received THREE emails, and not one shows the credit.  I am NOT a happy camper right now!!!  Where in the hell is my money?!?!,
My experience here was amazing! Celebrated my 23rd bday here and the room was perfect, services was great. I had the 1 room balcony suite, and let me tell you it was worth every buck! Unlike the fucken Quad! Peace of shit of a hotel is worse than a motel fucken 6! Ahahaha highly recommend Signature Suite.
If your idea of a good time includes listening to hard driving rock music  for endless hours while you are sitting in a penthouse on the 30th floor then this is the place for you. We booked in this hotel because it doesn't include a casino. We like to take a break from all the hustle and bustle - recuperate somewhere quiet. This hotel used to be great for that. Not anymore. Now the Wet Republic Pool has a DJ scene that blasts music non stop for hour and hours. . . Seriously we are in a 30th floor penthouse and even with ear plugs I can hear the music. I complained to the hotel staff and was told that it was "unfortunate".. . We won't stay here again.
My 2nd trip ever to Las Vegas (March 2012) I stayed at the MGM Signature and I LOVED it. My first trip ever I stayed at the Cosmopolitan across the Strip so I didn't want too much of a "fall off" in terms of luxury and amenities for my 2nd foray into Vegas. I was pleasantly surprised that the fall off was very minimal if at all. Fantastic suites (I opted for the junior suite but got to tour a balcony suite with the really cool big screen LCD TVs that pop out of the desk like a robot. My suite was huge and it felt more like an apartment than it did a hotel room. That may be because the Signature rooms are actually condos and hence are treated much better by MGM. The only drawbacks of staying at the MGM Signature is the fact you have a 10 minute walk to the closest restaurant over in the MGM itself but it's a short 10 minute walk, especially if you take the people mover. I was battling a cold during this trip as well so I did a LOT of sleeping and I was never disturbed or wakened by drunken Vegas debauchery. The pool was quiet, a complete polar opposite of the MGM pool which is simply mass chaos. If you are looking for the fun of vegas but a quiet hotel stay this is a great option. Two pieces of advice for anyone booking a room here: 1, book through MGM itself and NOT the property manager that rents out these rooms/condos. If you rent through the property manager housekeeping will NEVER show up and you'll be living in your own garbage and filth for your entire stay. I know this to be true from my neighbor who I heard complaining about it. 2, avoid taking the back exit to the 3rd Signature tower to walk up Harmon to get to the Strip. It actually takes you longer to walk that way than to simply walk through the MGM to get to the Strip. It is a haul and if it's hot out you're going to be sweating up bulletsLOL. I HIGHLY recommend this place and will likely stay here for my next trip.
Extremely nice hotel when considering its value.. . The one problem people seem to have with it is the walk, which takes you through the back of the MGM Grand and then past the casino, to the Strip, but it makes you feel kind of in a secluded area, where you know what you're doing (as in not a tourist).  The monorail is conveniently on the walk, so if you're heading to northern strip points, it's fine.. . This can get annoying, especially at night.  You have to go through the MGM basically - exiting through the entrance brings you to a long driveway down to Harmon (seemed sketchy with cars going pretty fast).. . I found the bottled water very cool.  Every staff member seems to be able to quickly access a fridge at it, at each tower and even the valets.. . Room was great with a balcony, kitchenette, and large bathroom (large tub with glass shower stall).. . *I stayed through one of the rental partners, Luxury Suites International, but the process works fine.  I'd assume the same for others, like Jet Luxury.
I loved the MGM grand signature room on 31st floor. Great view, large bathroom, spacious lounging room with a desk & a small kitchenette. We were staying in tower 1. Water is offered when we are waiting for our car from valet. . . Here is why 3 star. My husband & I decided to go down to the pool, sit in the cabana for an hour or so to drink, eat, & be merry. They wanted to charge a hefty fee of $250 to sit in a cabana. Pssstt, the food bill won't even come to $100 let alone a rental ofcovered cushions for my fat ass. It would be a different story if the pool was packed but it wasn't. Practically empty. They should just let the hotel guest use them drinking & eating having good time & make money the good old fashion way. The waitress showed up so late we moved on. . . It used to be fun to go to Vegas for complementary this & that but now everything is overpriced & getting charged for every little thing is getting old.
Lopita was great at finding us an amazing room with a great view! I loved everything about our room and balcony. Very clean and the shower was super large and the tub fit two people comfortably. Having in room coffee, microwave and refrigerator was great for heating up leftovers and keeping our beverages cold. Housekeeper Maria kept our home away from home clean and always kept our coffee stocked and gave us bottled water which is key in staying hydrated. Bryan awnsered all my questions I sent him via email to make sure all was set up correctly. I will make sure to contact him prior to our next trip.
My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights and I give it a 5 star rating based on our experience.  . . First the service was excellent, out trip started with a happy, friendly gentleman working the front gate who was all smiles and provided us with the directions we needed for entering and exiting the hotel.  We arrived at the front desk a little after . 9pm- there was a friendly employee who quickly got us registered and sent us on our way.  . . Our room: awesome, we had a balcony suite on the 30th floor in tower 2.  It was clean, up scale, and had fresh smelling aroma throughout the building.  If you are a person who doesn't like the smokey smell found in most casinos, this is the place for you.  We had a kitchenette, living space, bed space and the bathroom was amazing.  Two things to note here, while there was a microwave, fridge and cool top, there are no cooking utensils so just keep that in mind if you are planning a thrifty vacation and plan to eat in for meals.  My favorite feature was the buttons at the front door, you have a choice of "privacy please" or "housekeeping."  The house keepers never bang on your door, (I hate that!) and you have complete privacy without interruption with a press of your finger tips. . . The gym: we were in tower 2 which didn't have a gym but towers 1 and 3 did, with walkways connecting the 3 buildings, I didn't find this to be an issue for me.  The gym had the news equipment- with all the whistles and bells, hand towels, free water, and a clean atmosphere and most of all- it. Is free with your room which I can't say is always the truth at other luxury hotels. . . The pools: each tower has it's own. Pool and cabanas.  Poolside bar and. Food menu.  The drinks were $14 each but they didn't hold back on the alcohol.  The poolside service was excellent, drinks and meals served within minutes from ordering it.  The pool temperature was perfect for a 80 degree day in Vegas and I found myself planted at poolside each day. . . Amenities: you want to leave your hotel to go experience Vegas but you don't have to.  The Signature hotel has everything you need right there. There are a couple different  bars and restaurants, as well as a mandatory Starbucks :) if you want to go gambling, there is a walkway that connects the towers to the MGM.  I really is only a 5 minute walk- although I have read other peeps reviews complaining about the distance- really ? . . I can't say anything negative about our experience and I plan to stay there again in the future, it's an awesome bang for your dollar.
I loved my time at the Signature at MGM Grand (7 nights). The room we were in was very spacious, large bathroom, large bed, and there is a small kitchenette. The Signature is a great hotel for people who want to be close to the action, but do not want to be around recently-turned-21-year-olds-who-want-to-party all the time. I loved the fact that we could gamble and have fun, but then come back to a nice and quiet place.. . The pool is the same idea - no loud thumping music, no people who are there just to be seen - just a nice place to enjoy the sun. You have the option to rent a cabana, but we didn't rent one so I'm not sure if it is worth it or not.. . I said the wifi costs money, but it is part of the resort fee. The resort fee also covers the water that they give you when they clean the room.. . The down sides, for me, were not significant. Our TV wasn't great, the volume would cut out for periods of time. I complained to the front staff, but nothing was done. I was told they would send someone up to look at it but the problem remained. Not a big deal as I didn't come to Vegas to watch TV all day.. . The only other (small) down side is that the hotel is a bit of a hike. Now when I say a bit of a hike, I don't mean 40+ minutes to get anywhere fun. I just mean that you aren't taking an elevator ride to the casino and restaurants. If that is super important to you, then don't stay here.. . If or when I go back to Vegas, I would definitely go back to The Signature. It is great for someone who likes to be relatively close to the action, but have the option of having a nice and quiet hotel experience. Hope this helps!
I'm really impressed with this hotel, I booked a balcony suite with a full kitchenette. Bigger than I expected and the room has a lot of space. Not exactly ON the strip but the strip is one block away! I'll be back!
