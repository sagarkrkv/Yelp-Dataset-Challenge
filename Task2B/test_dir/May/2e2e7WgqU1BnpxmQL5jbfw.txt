Sandwich was very tasty. A bit pricy for a medium portion, but they gotta pay that Las Vegas rent somehow.
For vegetarians get the Caprese Sandwich.  So simple but Soooo good!  Warm mozzarella, basil and tomato on a warm and soft but crunchy around the edges bun.
Unbelievable that you can pack this much flavor into a sandwich. I rarely review on Yelp unless it's over the top good, and from the soup to the kid sandwiches, the flavors are amazing. Had a free breakfast at the Mandarin Oriental...glad I skipped it for this spot.
For early morning food one night after drinking in PBR Rock Bar I had a Hawaiian BBQ, which was absolutely delicious.. . Then for lunch on our final few hours in Vegas I had a Buffalo Chicken Wrap, which was packed with filling and was tasty too.  I would have visited this shop more often had I been staying at Planet Hollywood.. . I thought the prices were good value too.
Rediculously good. Smaller proportions for smaller price. Great deal...enjoyed thePasyrami, Chicken chipotle and the italaian. Will come back again next time for sure
One of my favorite parts of Vegas. Great sandwiches. I wish this location had the bread pudding.
Although there's always a line, it goes by fast. My go to item is the Full Montagu which has roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce, mmm! I plan to try the Thanksgiving sandwich next time!!. . PROCEDURE:. -Fall in line and look at menu to decide what you want before you get to the server.. -First server asks what your order is. Second server asks what drinks you want, grab whatever bottled drinks you want on the way or tell them what sized drink you want to along with paying at second server.. -Second server gives you a buzzer and receipt. Hold on to the receipt when picking up your order!. -Sit down and wait for your buzzer and your golden brick!!. . PROS. -Not bad for $5-$6 dollar sandwich, I always order 2 or 3 to take home.. -Fast service, never a long wait for your sandwich. -Self-serve drinks. -Sit where ya' want to eat!. . CONS. -Did these sandwiches get smaller or is it just me?. -I wish they had locations in the Bay Area.
Mozzerella & Basil Panini... thing... amazing. Actually, I've been here on several occasions & everything ordered has been amazing! Very casual, but perfect spot for a quick & delicious sandwich!
How can you not give earl of sandwich 5 stars. They are open 24 hours now and no matter what time I've gone, Ive never been disappointed. I always get the earls club and though it is not the biggest sandwich, it is tasty and cheap. Earl's will forever be the spot in vegas
Its ok, The bread was nice and crisp but the sandwich in general was ok like the review says I've had better. I think ill stick to Fire-house next time. The turkey and roast beef were bland. But I did love the bread.
The wife and kids were starving and giving me angry glares as I dragged them around the strip for about an hour looking for somewhere halfway decent to eat...then I realized this place had hot sandwiches and cold beers...done and done.. . THE FULL MONTAGU. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas?select=himxweK-gPR8lklN_7vXGA#himxweK-gPR8lklN_7vXGA. . Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce.  Delicious.  . . The wife enjoyed her sandwich...so the angry glare eventually turned into just a partially dirty look.. . Good enough for me.
I had heard amazing things about this place and I tried it and got the BLT and it was just ok  Nothing special about it.  I would recommend trying a different sandwich place.
Just a place you have to go to once while you're in Vegas! . . Yummy sandwiches!
sure a great sandwich around 3am after a long night of drinking and gambling
Sandwiches are reasonable and tasty.
Earl of Sandwich, PLEASE tell me the secret of your bread - it's just simply TOO good. I can just taste the 250-years of sandwich history in that single bite. . . For some reason, it took me more than 15 minutes just to find this place. Sadly, I just realized that I should have taken the OTHER side of the Miracle Mile Mall's entrance (south side of the Miracle Mile Mall's entrance, near the intersection of Harmon Ave and Las Vegas Blvd). . . The Full Montagu (roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce - $6.49):  The bread was perfectly toasted - fluffy and fresh. Flavorful roasted beef combined with amazing toasted bread = one delicious sandwich.. . Affordable and tasty sandwich shop that opens 24/7? That's probably one of the best thing that you can find at the Strip.
3.5. . Good Sandwiches. Solid taste for solid price, and there are chips, potato salad, macaroni salad to go with if you want. And a salad section if you are trying to be healthy in vegas. . . Given the stellar reviews of all my yelp friends are other reviewers, I thought this joint would blow my socks away. But in the end, it made me feel like a sandwich is just a sandwich. . . I tried the full Montague, The Original, Tuna Melt and Hawaiian BBQ. Out of those, I thought the Hawaiian BBQ was the best. If you like slightly sweet flavor, you will like it. I was prepared to be impressed by the Tuna Melt, but it felt short for me. The other two sandwiches were just slightly above average sandwiches. . . All in all, I would eat here if I was drunk and needed a late night snack or need to save a bit of $$ in Vegas, but other than that, I can't recommend going out of your way just to eat here.
Best sandwich place in Las Vegas! I can literally go to earl of sandwich at 3 am and get bomb sandwich. Can wait to go back to Vegas.
I was disappointed in the small selection... maybe this is why it's not called the King of Sandwich.  The prices were reasonable for the strip, the sandwich was okay, but not worth recommending.
dude, best crusted bread ever, crunchy, nice bounce, if all the bread i ever eat would taste like this, i would eat bread for breakfast. . i got the original 1762, the other popular choice seemed a bit too much early in the vegas mornings, its cool they give you a number pad that vibrates and lights up when your number is called just like lucilles, i also wanted to save room for more food during lunch buffet. . the taste was good, nicely roasted beef, creamy dressing, a perfect way to begin my day in vegas i'd say....i would come back everytime if im ever in the area
Two different lunch days. (the following is actually in order of when I had it).. . DON'T:. . Spicy Tuna Wrap: not spicy, fishy around the edges, not a happy medley. . DO:. . Tuna Melt: delicious. . *First day, they had plenty of drinks, second day.. nothing except for beer. I would've given this place one star until the second time around. So 2-3 Stars. If I had more to try, the rating might've been higher, but its hard to say.. . Cheap for LV.
Sandwiches and wraps are awesome here. Good option if you're in Vegas and need a quick, cheap bite.
Been here numerous times with friends and it's a really good sandwich shop.  The line seems long but it goes by quick.  The sandwiches themselves are good and fresh but the best part is the bread.  You just have to try the place out for yourself and you'll know why the place is solid.
I'm constantly craving Earl's whenever I'm away from Vegas. I've tried their Anaheim location and it just doesn't taste the same. I don't know if it's because the location is Vegas or if it's the fact that I'm highly intoxicated 80% of the time when I eat here. . . I always order the Full Montagu. It is sooo delicious, it leaves me wanting to eat more. I've tried their breakfast sandwiches, Caribbean Jerk, and soups. THEY HAVE THE BEST TOMATO SOUP BTW!!!!
This place is pretty darn good! The line was long when I went, but the wait was worth it. I had the turkey cranberry sandwich and it was probably the best I've ever had in my life. No joke. And it's not even that expensive. They have a bunch of options to choose from. I'm sure they're all good!
Love this place!!!!  Always end my nights in Vegas with a Sandwich from Earl of Sandwich!!!!
Not impressed at all by the food at Earl's.. . This is located in the miracle mile shops and you can spot it as soon as you enter. Usually there is a long line but they have an efficient way of handling their orders so it moves quickly. First, you tell the worker what you want, then move down to the register and tell the cashier what you ordered. Sandwich gets made pretty quickly after. . . So this is a good place to go if you need a quick bite and you're hungry. However, do not expect the best tasting sandwich.  Ordered the Reuben and there was barely any meat and it was extremely thin. Not enough sour kraut either and the bread was nothing to write home about. It felt oily and heavy too despite the sandwich not having much content. . . So unfortunately this is one of those occasions where the food did not meet the hype. But it's cheap and quick and at least it's a step above McDonald's.
I keep hearing my friends rave about this place.. One even got it to go for her mom back in Seattle. So it kind of sucks that when I did get to try it, I was pretty much drunk from the club. . However, I still remember  that it was amazing.. Especially with the tomato soup. Everyone flocks here late at night, but I'm sure it's actually busy at all times. . Will have to try it again when I am sober.
Earl of Sandwich, located in the Magical Mile shopping mall, is a good place to get sub sandwiches, soups, and salads when you're all buffeted out and want something simple for lunch.. . Regular soups are $4.49.  We tried the Tortilla Soup, which was spicy and thick like a chili, and the Baked Potato Soup, which was bland compared to the Tortilla Soup, I would skip this one.. . Hot 6-inch sub sandwiches are $6.49.  We tried the Chipotle Chicken Avocado which had chunks of chicken and avocado with a mild sauce, the Earl's Club with bacon and cheese, and our favorite of the three sandwiches, the Full Montague with roast beef, turkey and Swiss.. . Earl of Sandwich is a fast and affordable option when you're on the go.
good sandwiches
I've got a golden ticket, I've got a golden twinkle in my eye! Oh wait, that's just a heavenly sandwich wrapped in gold. . . Earls!! How do you do it? How do you produce delicious sandwiches 24 hours a day for all the drunk people of Vegas? And more importantly, why aren't you in NorCal? It just isn't fair!. . Earls is def the best place to get a sandwich. The best is toasty and delish and it's full of meat and yummy sauce and everything wonderful. . . Expect to stand in a long like during rush times. It's hard to wait, I know. But it's worth it.
I am always a fan of their original sandwich. . . Although there is always a line, food comes out usually faster than what it seems like. . . It's just a very nice stop if you are in the middle of the strip (Planet Hollywood) and just trying to get something to eat so that you can go gamble or hang out.
I think I'm one of the few people who just doesn't care for Earls, and thats probably considering that I'm vegetarian, and they have only 2 sandwich options.  . . I've been here plenty of times and I loved their vegetarian sandwich that was stuffed with feta cheese, veggies, balsamic etc.  It was delicious! However, I remember going back and they had taken the sandwich off the menu. I was bummed and when I asked them for a different option, they said the only sandwich they had was the caprese.  I wasn't feeling it, and I asked if they would mind making me something else, they said they couldn't.  THAT MAKES NO SENSE. I just wanted a sandwich stuffed with veggies, cheese, etc. but they said that wasn't allowed.  I was so furious, considering I waited in such a long line and I was starving. . . Coming here this past weekend.  I saw that they added another veggie option to their menu, I was stoked to try it, however when I arrived to the front of the line, the cashier said they had run out.  When I asked if they could make me something else, they once again denied this request.  . . I suggest they step up their service & offer more vegetarian options. . . BTW the two stars are for their sandwich bread. Its just so good.
Loving EOS!...The wait is not really that long. The sandwiches are fresh, and really tasty!...I like the fact that you can order a good sandwich, go right back to the casino, order a soda from the waitress and play on! The Casino IS kind of loud, but what do you expect from girls dancing on tables?...JK, it's a young adult's dream play pen! Eat @ Earl's...Nothing like a late night sandwich to finish off that long day of Yard Drinks!
Finally tried this place after many attempts (it's easy to get sidetracked in Vegas!)  And yes, I do think this Sandwich place lives up to the hype.  It's basically a really good panini with tasty fillings, how can you go wrong?. . +The artisan bread they use is really good.  And filling.  And a bit greasy.  It really coats the stomach if you know what I mean.. +Veggie sandwich was VERY good. . +Long lines but they move really fast.. . As a side note, the sandwich was really good when I was sober.  But after a night of drinking, the leftovers were amazing!
Time for an update. Again, the sandwiches are all really good. My favorites are the original, pastrami rueben, italian, and I'm sure every single sandwhich that I'll try in the future.. . Now i yanked 1star for the personnel. We asked if there was cheese in a certain soup and a couple of them couldn't answer. Seemed like an easy one to find out.  On another occasion, we asked to slighty customize our sandwhich and they seem confused and it didn't come out as we wanted.
First time, the worst experience I have ever had with food. The management was horrible, the kitchen was ran by dumb and dumber today they could not even order our meal correctly. The iced tea had black ooze coming out of it and the lemonade was so sour it was awful.. I ordered the chicken chipotle avocado sandwich. Which gave me salmonella poisoning. I experienced the worst food poisoning in my entire life out of both ends. I would hope no one else has to experience this. The service was awful and they need to get their kitchen checked from the health department. Sick as a dog.
love the cobb salad
24!
Best sandwiches hands down! I was a little skeptical about what to order. My friend told me that the holiday turkey is really good but I'm not a big fan of turkey. It turned out delicious!! It was a interesting combination, a little sweet and a little salty. We also got a club sandwich, a salad, the chili and the loaded potato soup. Both the chili and loaded potato soup was bomb!! I heard really good things about the cheddar broccoli soup, so I'm definitely going to have to go back and try it before I leave! The club sandwich was just okay, but pretty full sandwich. Lots of bacon and avocado.. Although the line can be long, it moves really quickly and the food comes relatively quickly as well. There was nothing special about the salad, my friend was just trying to be healthy. . . If you are in town, you must try this place!!
Yelp has let me down....again. I don't understand the hype. Chicken chipotle sandwich made me puke less than 10 minutes after eating it. Gross....gross...gross. I won't trust yelp reviews any longer...
24 hour.. EARL OF SANDWICH?! omg. great sandwiches, great bread, fast moving line.. I mean, the line isn't nearly as long as the one in Downtown Disney in Anaheim, so this line was a treat to stand in. . . Ample seating, though they could use more for a location like this.. . . Not much else to complain about, other than the fact that it's inside planet hollywood. yuck.
i purposely stayed away from the earls in downtown disney because everyone kept telling me, i needed to try the one in vegas first.  after trying it i can only ask, WHY?  the sandwiches were whatevs.  and small.  we ordered the earls club and the hawaiian and it was really mediocre.  now, had i just gotten out of the clubs and still semi buzzed, i'm pretty sure it would have tasted delicious, but sober and hungry me was disappointed.  for the 2 sandwiches we paid around 11.  . . honestly, i would take Ike's from up north over Earls any day.
Mmmmmm ..... . That is all I said after a single bite of this luscious goodness that melts in your mouth with tons of flavornoids delivered straight to your palates! . This is a must! Do come here at least once if you are in the area!. Chipotle Chicken is the one you want!. Montagu is alright...:/
During my Vegas trip, hunger erupted on the second day drastically.  A friend of mine recommended Earl of Sandwich.  I was hungry and McDonalds is out of the question so Earl of Sandwich it was.  The lines were very long and packed but it is Vegas so it came to no surprise for me.  I really can't remember what I had specifically but it was along the lines of a bbq sandwich.  Nonetheless it was delicious.  The meat was tender, moist and filled with bbq richness.  I would definitely be back again.  It was one of the highlights of the trip.
