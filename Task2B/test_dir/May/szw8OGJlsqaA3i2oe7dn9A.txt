The food and pastries here were fantastic. The service was very friendly. Their pricing is extremely high and not locals friendly.
Service can be slow and indifferent due to the huge crowds.  However, the pastries are top notch.  Add an overpriced coffee and enjoy yourself.
I feel bad.  I've passed by this Jean Philippe Patisserie inside ARIA countless times, but I had never tried tried them until this last trip to Vegas.  I always knew they had some awesome sweets and desserts, and that they sold various types of pastries and croissants.  However, if I had known their paninis were so good, I would have come here so much sooner!. . Although they aren't always busy, there's usually a crowd on Sunday mornings.  Like my friends and I, a lot of people drop in to grab something relatively quick before heading to the airport.  However,don't be scared off by the line; it may look bad, but it actually moves rather steadily.  Finding seats when they're busy, on the other hand, can be a little tough.. . While a couple of us secured a table, my buddy helped me order the PROSCIUTTO PANINI (~$11).  It looked good on the menu (Cured Italian Ham, Basil Aioli, Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, and Tomatoes), but it tasted even better.  Prosciutto and mozzarella are two of my favorites, but I really liked the aioli and how the bread was perfectly buttered and toasted.  It's a little messy to eat (it drips), but it's delicious!. . Based on my sandwich alone, Jean Philippe Patisserie is easily worth FOUR AND A HALF STARS, but I rounded down because of price.  As good as it was, the portion was just a little too light for the money.  Still, it beats the food prices at the airport though.  Now I just have to make my way back to try some of their sweeter treats!
Delicious!!! Ended up eating there twice in two days. The first day I ordered the key lime tart which was very good. The second day I ordered the white chocolate , chocolate, Oreo cheesecake which was AMAZING!!!! I want to try everything!!!
Yet another awesome establishment inside the Aria.  I didn't try the food, but I did indulge in the pastries and coffee.  Be prepared to pay tourist prices here... it's not cheap by any means. The quality is very high and the service is great.  I particularly enjoyed this place because they allowed me to grab and go without me having to worry about how I'm dressed.  . . Their cheesecake and gelatos are a no brainer.
I was in heaven with the almond croissant, apple brioche and bold, rich coffee served at Jean Phillippe Patisserie!. . Wow, the croissants couldn't have been any more buttery or flaky, with just the right amount of sweetness ---very authentic to French style for sure!. . There are two locations...one in Aria and the other in Bellagio...I visited the one in Aria which was underground right near the casino...I wonder if the Bellagio location has more natural light. . . The only thing is that it feels like a dark dungeon eating in this patisserie...the patio overlooks all the slot machines...which isn't ideal.. . THe crepes are supposed to be very good, so next time i come to Vegas I will check out the Bellagio location. . . Try the croissants for sure, they know what they're doing if you like French food.
The Gelato is pretty much on point here. For basically $3 a giant scoop it's worth it. I ain't sayin' you should get this every day, but when you here and after a meal, and you got a sweet tooth....get the Hazelnut, Oreo, Tiramisu, and Creme brulee mix. It's worth it.
It's a little on the lower side of ratings. Maybe less than three stars. . . I thought lemon would be great and mango would be horrible, but it was quite the opposite.. . Consistency: can lack, not overall smooth (for both flavors). . Lemon: bitter as hell. . Mango: delicious. . Price point: Kind of cheap for what I got. . Scoop size: your second scoop is smaller, kind of meh.. . People in my group liked this place, I've had better. . . -. . I don't like how they bill you in a restaurant tab though, kind of annoying in hassle way, kind of absurd. (this does not reflect my rating).
Definitely the best french bakery I've experienced yet! Everything I tried here was very delicious and perfectly made. The macarons were very light and fresh and had very accurate flavor interpretations. There are so many pastries, cakes and tarts to choose from that it will make your head spin! I didn't have the opportunity, nor the stomach capacity to sample everything I wanted to, but I did try the ones that stood out the most to me. Yummay!. . I decided to try one of their many lunch options on one of my visits here. They offer about four types of paninis as well as various sandwiches on Croissants. I believe they also have a few salad options to choose from that would satisfy your appetite. For anyone who doesn't want to indulge in the various cakes or pastries, they have a large variety of Gelato flavors to choose from which can also be made into shakes if you'd like. They have various flavors of chocolate Bon Bons as well! The Banana was my favorite flavor And I recommend everyone try at least one.. . Overall, I would stop in here everyday that I'm in Vegas again in the future. There were a bunch of other items that I still would love to try. One thing that kinda bothered me but didn't ruin my experience here, was that some of the employees, working the registers n such, are not very friendly and have this miserable demeanor about them, as if they don't really care for dealing with customers. Put a smile on your face and at least look as if you are happy to be there for goodness sake! lol.
I LOVE this place! I easily spend over $200 here every time I come to Vegas. I can't keep myself out of this place and buy a little here and there every single day.  Doesn't help that I see this place before going up to my room at Aria.. . Berry crepe - marinated berries over their sweet crepe and served with whipped cream. The raspberries are added on fresh though. Berries are lightly sweet and tart. I don't like cooked strawberries so I will order it with fresh berries next time. As always, the crepe texture is perfect, slightly chewy, flavorful, and thin.. . Smoke salmon sandwich - after reading on Yelp this is THE sandwich to get, I tried it and it lived up to its reputation. This is a cold sandwich (why wouldn't it be with the cold smoked salmon?). The bread is a dill infused bread; inside is a sliced boiled egg, smoked salmon of course, dill spread, red onions which I believe are marinated in some kind of vinegar mix. It's soooo good, the bread is so fresh, but beware and have gum or something after eating it - it's loaded with onions in a good way.. . Chocolate nougat - my favorite candy from this place. I prefer it over their vanilla nougat as the texture of more chewy. He never skimps on the nuts. Surprisingly, it is not too sweet considering nougat is really just pure sugar.. . Pistachio nougat - these are individually wrapped and has pistachio paste to bump up the pistachio flavor. They tasted really good, but I prefer the texture of their chocolate nougat.. . Marshmallows - they taste like those valentine heart candies from back in elementary. I'm guessing the alcohol in the vanilla extract lent a hand in this. I liked the raspberry flavor best. They are rolled in powdered sugar which creates a little crust all around. It's softer than commercial marshmallows and moist. Nice to try, but won't buy it again.. . I noticed this time they offer omelettes now, cooked on the crepe machine, but I didn't try it.. . If there is one sweet thing you try from here, get a crepe. Savory - go for the smoked salmon sandwich.
Ordered 2 cakes for my girlfriend's birthday. 2 separate parties. The guest cake was great but the second was wrong everything. Wrong flavor, wrong color, and just a huge disappointment. I placed the order 3 days in advance and picked up the second cake on the way to her private party with just friends. It was obviously too late to fix their mistake and to make it worse they didn't offer even an apology. At over $60 a cake I say go elsewhere.
Come here as much I can for take out I usually get salmon or ham sandwich awesome desserts ice mocha and blue berry Danish .... Always check your take out bag. Never miss it's always wrong ask for 2 Danish I get muffin or 1 Danish. If not for this it's a 5 star... But it's all good !
I only had two items here, a chocolate croissant and a powerade (to help restore some electrolytes lost from the night before). The chocolate croissant was awesome, with a fluffy inside, chocolate bits scattered around, and a nice crust on the outside. The powerade was... well... powerade. Oh, by the way, why a 20oz powerade costs $5.25? I have no idea.
This is my new go to place for lunch, while staying at the Aria. Their tuna melt is amazing! I passed by this place several times thinking it was just a pastry shop but they have several lunch options available from quiche to ham and cheese croissants. Their desserts are beautiful. I had the snickers mousse tart and it was delicious.
We stayed at Aria on a trip to Vegas and this place was mine and my fiance's go to spot. We had lunch here and their salads are excellent. The flavor and freshness was the best I'd ever had at any restaurant or lunch spot. I am not a huge fan of gelato but their gelato is spot on. It was by far the best I'd ever had. I tried the cheesecake and tiramisu gelatos and they both tasted the like the actual desserts. The only thing I did not enjoy was their actual white chocolate covered cheesecake which I felt lacked flavor. However, my palate may have been jaded by all of the other sweets I had that weekend. Their biscotti was also the best I'd ever had. It was chocolate with white chocolate covering it and almonds baked in. I sound like I should have diabetes with all of the stuff we tried but we couldn't help it, it was SO good!
