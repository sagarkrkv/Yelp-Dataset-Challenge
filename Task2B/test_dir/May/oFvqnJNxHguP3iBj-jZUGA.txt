No matter how many times I come to Vegas I still want to see the Fountains. . . For about 10ish minutes you are in a trance over the dancing beautiful waters of BELLLLAGGGGGIOOO. I like to say it all in my fancy voice. I am always in awe and if you aren't you must be dead inside. . . This is one of the great free shows of Vegas. So grab some gelato from inside the hotel and head on out for a front row seat to one of the best fountains in the world.
Its free, its pretty, its something different on the strip. Kids will probably like it. It didnt wow me as much as I expected.
One of the few things in Vegas that is not tacky or garish, over the top or underwhelming. An Unhidden gem, and, amid a lot of fake glitter, real gold.
Vegas, you and all of your free entertainment and sights! . . There are so many shows in Vegas that are WORTH paying for, but I think the nicest part about Vegas is going from hotel to hotel and just browsing around. The architecture, the designs, the paintings. the chocolate "waterfall" that made me want to have my open mouth at the end of the cascading chocolate dripping from the roof (this is also inside the Bellagio!) they are all free to see. In the realm of free vegas entertainment I can safely say the fountains are at the top of the list. This is a must do when in Vegas. . . On a romantic trip? Do IT! With kids? Do IT! Alone? Do it...then cry because you are watching this alone!. . These fountains are mindblowing! It's a choreographed show with massive streams of water shooting up and down - dancing to the music. Set up inside an 8-acre, manmade lake with over 1,200 nozzles shooting water out as tall as 460 feet, the water almost dances to the music. . . It does get super crowded, so get their early and plot out your spot. Almost every spot around the railing is a good view. The show times vary from weekdays to weekends but the shows start every 30 minutes (in the afternoons) and every 15 minutes (in the evenings when it's more packed.) Your best bet is to get it done in the early evening - you want to see it with the lights lit up.. . From their website:. *On Sundays Fountain show times begin at 11 a.m. and run every 15 minutes for the Fountains Brunch at Jasmine.. . MAN I wish I had known that...that might be one of the nicest brunch experiences ever. And if you know me, I love me some brunch.
This would be my favorite Las Vegas attraction.. . I could stand and watch the fountains for an hour plus sometimes... The Bellagio website lists times and songs, they are played randomly but the night shows are every 15 minutes apart so there is time to catch a few in a row.  The day time shows are great too, especially when the sun is out and a rainbow can be seen while they're going.. . My two favorites are "Time to say goodbye" and "Viva Las Vegas". . Other places to catch this attraction with different views are from the Eiffel tower across the street...you can hear and see the show from up there, as well as outside at Paris' Mon Abi Gabi restaurant.  I was able to catch the fountains while on the High Roller this past week and that was super cool as well.  Do NOT miss out on this while in Vegas!
It's hard to pass by the bellagio and not stop for the free show. Each one is unique and well done.
This is a show that basically put an end to the war between hotels to try and get you out front of them to see a free show.... . Why?. . Because it's just beyond anything any other hotel could ever muster up, unless they rebuilt themselves. Treasure Island and Excalibur folded up their free show shop completely. Mirage is basically the only competition left, and it's fire can't match up to the Bellagio's water.. . The shows are every 15 minutes.. which is just unreal when you think about the amount of energy used.. . But I dare you.. DARE YOU to try and walk by and not stop to take it in. It's such a beautiful entrancing spectacle.. . Go in the day, come back for the night show.
Hands down best thing to see in Vegas.
The world is a carousel of -- wait.. this isn't World of Color. . . I love that they added new music soundtracks to sync to the fountains (or vice versa) and that it's a free show every half hour (or 15 min on weekend nights), but the fountains and their layout make for predictable sequences. . . still a technological modern marvel though, with it being in the middle of the desert and have that much water flying about. :)
Aim to get a spot in the middle. At night, the show goes on every 15mins. Every shows different because they play different songs & the water goes to the beat. It's a very fun experience. Every person visiting Vegas has to check it out once!
