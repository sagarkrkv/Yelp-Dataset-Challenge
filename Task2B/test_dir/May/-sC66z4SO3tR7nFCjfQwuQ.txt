Shrimp tacos!!  all day every day any day they are just Bomb ! the carne asada ain't bad either margaritas are coo def get chips w/ the guacamole ! Delicious !!
I really liked the food and atmosphere but I couldn't shake the feeling that this place might not be the cleanliest. The first coffee cup I was given had lipstick marks all over it. It happens. No biggie. But then I watch the server grab a new cup and when I get it, it also has lipstick marks all over it. Hoping it was just a fluke.
Atmosphere: Fun, hip, relaxed.. . Food: Great.  Best menu items are the tacos, verde enchiladas, and carne asada burrito. . . Biggest complaint: Their to-go order process.  When you arrive for pickup, the hostess says she needs to go "find your waiter".  They assign a different waiter to every order, which makes the process inefficient.  After she hunts down your waiter, they come find you then see if your order is ready for pickup (which is never the case).  Bottom line is the process takes 10 minutes where it should only take a couple.
First, it smells great just walking up to the restaurant. My sever tells me that it is the mesquite and pecan wood on the grill. It smells really good. . . Sitting on the patio and it is about 85 degrees so perfect day. The place is really busy - surprisingly so. Even though it is in the lobby of a small hotel it looks like most diners are local.. . I had the carna asada burrito and it was excellent.  The meat was really flavorful and tasty. The avocado gave it nice texture. It was just good. . . They served two sauces - a green tomatillo sauce and a red chile sauce. Both were good. The heat from the red sauce, though, tended to hide the taste of the burrito which was unfortunate because the burrito was so good so I stuck mostly with the tomatillo sauce. . . One pet peeve - the serve soda in cans and not fountain. I don't know why restaurants do this. Fountain soda tastes so much fresher and is a better compliment to the food than tinny canned soda. . . I'm looking forward to conning back from either fish tacos or when it's cooler the tortilla soup.
On short family reunion to the Verde Valley and Phoenix, ate here. I had chilaquiles, my wife and brother-in-law had tortas, and his wife had fish tacos. Service good but the staff person was so busy she did not connect terribly well. We were the oldest folks there, all in our 70's and the millennial crowd was hooping it up...so not a good place for a quiet supper.
Great breakfast. A friend of mine is a pancake connoisseur and says they have the best pancake he has ever had. I will say I've had better chilaquiles, but their other Mexican food is great! Excellent lunches. They let you mix and match tacos so you can try a lot of different things. All the beverages Ive tried, from tea, to coffee (which they get from a local roaster), to cocktails like margaritas are very tasty. The only real negative is how popular the place is. Parking is limited so it can be a challenge to actually get in.
After a year I thought I would try to see if anything got better.... I did NOT. My food was cold. I had to get my own chili sauce since the waiters were doing nothing,  cause it wasn't even that busy. Took forever to just get my sprite in the first place too.  Won't return. Horrible service and cold meat.
So here's another place where the food is excellent, but the front-of-house is seriously lacking.. . We've just had a baby, so dining out has (temporarily) been replaced by taking out. We still enjoy the food we used to, only we now get to pause eating when the little bundle of joy decides he's hungry or needs changing, or if the wind blows in the wrong direction. Because he is quite vocal in letting us know. We could, of course, become "those people" who really don't care about the tranquility of others when dining out, but we chose not to be.. . Gallo Blanco has a great website with the menu items listed in detail, they offer quite the selection with reasonable prices. They support to-go orders and even offer curbside pickup! That is of course IF you can get through to them.. . I called the number listed on their website at about 4pm and the call goes straight to voicemail. "Leave a message if you want to make a reservation". Hmmm, thinking I'd mistakenly called the reservations number, I checked their website and the to-go number is the same as the reservations number which is the same as the main number - it is THE number. I tried a few more times, but it would always go directly to voicemail with nairy a ring. I even tried to call the hotel main number, which was answered, and asked to be transferred to the restaurant, but again I got the dreaded voicemail of death. I called the hotel back and told them my dilemma, but they were all out of options. Hmmmm.... . We had our hearts set on the menu items we had chosen that I decided to drive there and have a happy-hour beer while I waited. Inside is a bit odd. I entered through the To-Go Door. They have a counter where you can sit, which at first glance could be mistaken for a bar, but it isn't. There was an open seat, so I sat at the pseudo-bar and waited, and waited, and waited some more. The problem with it not being a bar is that there is no-one permanently stationed there. Sure, plenty of people came back and forth because it is right in front of the kitchen, but no-one came to take my order. Directly to the left is a host station with two greeters (but no phone!) The place was busy, but these two were just standing around making high-school chat.. . Finally I was able to flag someone down, not the first four or five people as they just ignored me and kept on trucking, but someone who was able to take my order and no, they couldn't explain why the phone went directly to voicemail, nor did they really care.. . So, in summary - the food is great, if you can get it.
The food is consistently amazing and the carne asade is the best in town. Lately, the service has been really sllllllow. Can't be in a lunch rush, as you should expect to be here at least 2 hours.
Food was OK ...service was horrible! My fiance and I went in and the server forgot about us. Then a nice young lady came and took care of us but once the food was out she didn't come and check on us until we were about done. I've heard so many good things about this place but it was my first time here and I was dissapointed.
Wednesday- Come for the Happy Hour, stay for the Flamenco. An extraordinary performance by a group of passionate, dedicated professionals. . . Thursday- Come back again for the food! . . I love this place, and am so glad we discovered a high quality of food at a reasonable price, so close to home.. . (Review written Feb 2013, posted way late!)
Excellent food, ambience and service. You want to relax and enjoy it. The food is distinctive of Southern Mexico versus the typical Sonoran or TexMex
It certainly doesn't have a Mexican restaurant look, but the food was superb. Gallo Blanco, located inside the Clarendon, is more focused on being a classy date night type of restaurant than a cliche multicolored gimmicky thing, and I'm fine with that. Plus, the live  flamenco dancers on Wednesday nights is a nice touch. . . We ordered a variety of their tacos, carne asada being my favorite. We also tried an assortment of salsas and guacamole.  No complaints there either, but the green salsa was addictively good and by far my favorite. . . As you wait to be seated, check out the beautiful rooftop view of the Clarendon, overlooking central Phoenix, and dip your toes in their awesomely conceived pool. Overall, this was a very good experience, and I'd love to return to try more items.
White Sangria is great and the tacos are even better. They had an Octopus taco that was awesome. Ahi tuna taco was great as well. Great food. Guac was really good.
BEST Mexican food in AZ!!  The pork burrito is my favorite.  It's not listed on the menu but it is available and very delicious!
Love love this place! We love bringing out of town guests here because the food is excellent and the atmosphere is on point. There is normally a wait however we never mind because we either grab a drink at the roof top bar, sip a cocktail by the pool or check out the live entertainment they occasionally have. The walls inside and outside the restaurant feature art from local artists - I love a restaurant that supports it's. Local community! The food is also very very good and well priced! Drink sangria, eat tacos, it's a win!
I asked my Phoenix friend to take me to the best Mexican restaurant in town, and this is where he took me on my visit. I am happy that he did. I returned again during my trip. This restaurant had everything I love -- excellent and inventive drinks, delicious fresh chips with homemade salsas (the verde sauce rules!) and among the best guac I've had, and creative dishes in small portions that pay homage to the traditional Mexican menu. My favorites were the Elote street corn, which I think I could eat every meal for the rest of my life, the chicken taco, and the salad with grilled chicken, apples, mint and peanut sauce. The sangria was the best white sangria I've had in any restaurant.. . One caveat to this rave review: I did not care for the pork torta. I do not like to eat a lot of bread, and the sandwich was ridiculously huge and overwhelming. Beneath the cavernous bread was a small portion of pork. Perhaps it is my Tennessee sensibilities about pork or my Californian experience with carnitas, but the pork was lackluster, dry, and tasted like that pork you get in a sandwich in the school cafeteria with the pre-mixed sauce. The restaurant should make torta "sliders" and add a generous portion of real carnitas to improve this dish (see the Pastor at Taco Guild for an example).  . . Overall, though, it is hard to beat this experience, the friendliness of the staff, the excellent food and all of the options that left me wanting more.
I LOVE this place. I mean. I've been eating here for the past few weeks at least twice a week. So. Yummy. . . I love their staff. The owners are great. The food is exceptional. Strong drinks. It's just lovely. . . Try the breakfast burrito, the carne asada burrito, the fundido and chips, guacamole, ok ok anything on the menu is spectacular.
