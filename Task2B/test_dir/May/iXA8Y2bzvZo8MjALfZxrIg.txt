I get it. Judge away. Yes, I was in Vegas and ate at Margaritaville - out of all the thousands of other restos. But the bride-to-be was in charge and wanted 'ritas and queso. . . I'd actually never been to Margaritaville. I will say that the "Perfect Margarita" was good - strong, pure lime juice, agave and semi-guilt free. The queso had nothing on real Texas queso, but the salsa was good. Other menu items weren't too intriguing - they have fish tacos but your only option is beer-battered. I settled on the grilled chicken which was pretty plain Jane. . . I will say the best part of the experience - other than the 'ritas and odd people-watching - was our service from Ryan L. He brought out the drinks fast - even one on the house as he noticed our bride was crying tears of joy - and even split our checks without our party even requesting that. (And that's the only restaurant in Vegas that did it. Not even the top-dollar restos would accommodate.)
Margaritaville is pricey but what do you expect for Vegas? The good thing about it, however, is that the portions are HUGE. Split your meals when you come here and it will make up for the prices. Our server was excellent. He switched out a margarita I ordered for a different drink for free just because I thought it was too sweet and searched endlessly through the TV channels to find exactly what we wanted to watch. I highly recommend this place. Great tasting food, huge portions, and amazing service. Not to mention a nice tropical atmosphere with misters and Palm trees.
The place was hopping on a Sat evening in Las Vegas, but we managed to get a table within 20 minutes. Everyone at the table got hamburgers and we all enjoyed our meals. I also got the key lime pie for dessert, which was delicious. There is a lotof noise in this restaurant making it difficult at times to have a conversation. Every so often, they also put on a fun show with dancing and a young lady dressed in a bikini popping out of a volcano and then sliding down a water slide into a big margarita glass filled with water! Maybe not the best place for younger kids but we all had a good time.
Mmm, you can almost taste the mediocrity!. . Went here on Cinco de Mayo because we had to have margaritas and we were able to score a seat on the upper deck, which I thought was nice until they told us they couldn't put up the umbrellas due to wind so that we baked in the unrelenting Vegas sun.. . Ordered overpriced margaritas in tiny plastic cups filled with ice as well as a shrimp appetizer that came with exactly 5 1/2 shrimp.. . For my entree, I ordered the shrimp trio which was about Red Lobster quality at twice the price ($25).  I did like the spicy sauce with the coconut shrimp, though.  . . Service from the waitress was nice but they have a line to stand in if you want a table upstairs, only it's not marked and the lady who was seating people wouldn't tell people where to go, so people would come upstairs and then stand at the front of the line in front of people who had been waiting 20 minutes.  It was comical to watch.. . I'm not the target demographic for this joint so take my review with a shaker of salt.  I equate Jimmy Buffet to the Ethan Hawke character in the film "Reality Bites" and regard each with disdain, so that may color my opinion.
Funny reading the below review from the same day that I went(Cinco De Mayo) because my experience was the complete opposite! LOL! MAN! Did we have a blast visiting Margaritaville! I'd say if that Bill T. guy was partying at the 5 O'clock Somewhere Bar with us than he would of for sure had fun too! This location is HUGE so I can see how you would get different service depending on where you sit. Also Billy the Bartender made the experience much more enjoyable.. . We pretty much walked into the first Mexican themed place that we saw which just so happen to be Margaritaville. Sat down at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender Billy. His energy is off the wall! Brought out the energy in us! LOL! Of course we ended up partying with the people we were sitting next to which became 1 big party. Awesome atmosphere. Almost every person that I saw hanging out in there had a huge smile!. . Billy the Bartender suggested we try the FRYCHOS basically nachos but with Fries, which weren't anywhere on the menu but I was able to request for it from the kitchen for the same price! They were the BOMB! Def hit the spot for my hang over! We also ordered shrimp skewers that weren't the best & very overpriced. . . The drinks were tasty buuuut more so STRONG!. . All the staff I came across was outstanding!. . Thank you Margaritaville & Billy for showing us an awesome Cinco De Mayo! We definitely will be back to party again!! :)
Not a place for large groups.  Took a group here (75 plus people) and service was unprepared and seemingly inexperienced with serving large groups.  Also no good place to pull a bus up to for group dropoff and pickup.  Rough and awkward experience...won't be coming back.
I love the deck upstairs for lunch but this time in Vegas we came here late evening on Cinqo de Mayo and sat at the bar. The volcano nachos and a Landshark were calling my name. We were hungry as we only had apps at Ra Sushi and skipped dinner. It was the perfect late night snack and we devoured the huge nacho tower. Please don't share the calorie count with me- as what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas and those nachos helped absorb the alcohol so I would feel like new in the morning.
This was my fourth time swinging by Margaritaville and I'm sad to say I think this place is heading downhill.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and remembered our orders but the food was horrible.  Absolutely horrible. Please bear in mind that I was with a party of six and everything, even the salad wasn't up to par, especially considering the fact that they've raised all their prices.  I believe I had ordered a Bahama Momma drink which I thought was pretty good but all the other drinks that were ordered lacked alcohol and tasted too much like sugar.  Anyways its right on the strip so I don't believe they'll go out of business but it's just a little sad to report this because I used to truly enjoying coming to Margaritaville while visiting Vegas.
Been coming here since the place opened.  Ok, only two or three times a year on my visits to make deposits to the casino banks.  The Cheeseburger in Paradise is my favorite, but the steak salad is close.  For those who love onion rings - look no further -theirs are the best.  Since my drinking days are over, can't comment on that, but the food and the service, and the FUN! are exception.  Great videos, great volcano show, not to mention the decor (some may not like it), but I really enjoy the sportfishing 'boat' as well as Jimmy's giant amphib flying over the restaurant.  First saw JB in concert in 1976, so I might be a little biased, lol!
I love this place it's a staple of Las Vegas to me. They have strong margaritas and a very fun atmosphere in addition to casino. The food is decent however a bit pricey for what it is. Overall a very good experience!
Definitely a great place to hang out and grab a bite to eat with some friends. I had the jambalaya, it was very good. Also the volcano nachos were great. Just watch out, the portions are large.
Drinks were really good. The food not worth the trip...(Crab & Corn Chowder, Seafood Mac & Cheese - Bad; Fish Taco's very average).  Atmosphere fun.  And, service was average.
Slower service, but the food and atmosphere provide a fun experience.
Needed a relaxing dinner so we went to margerittavillle. It was REALLLY good food. Good sandwiches! Sat in bar, not very fast service . The nachos are huge! We also had taco salad which I suggest for smaller group of people who may want nachos.
Shelley is the bomb! $2 tequila shots all day every day plus great bar tending couldn't be a better place to start a trip!
Ultimate Margaritas is necessary. Ultimate Nachos is necessary. That's all you need here.
Wow!. If you are a Parrothead such as myself, you will love the way they have the place decorated. And you will understand what some of the dongs and other artifacts stand for. It was like going home...to Margaritville. The food isn't give-star cuisine. Just good decent selection of a Parrotheads favorites.. Stop by and enjoy the adventure.
