The worst food in Vegas awful service. The fries were soft, oily and were tasting burn,. The cod for fish and chips was good but 28$ for a fish and chips??? And 10$ for a peroni? Little too much. Horrible experience.
The best lunch thus far in Vegas! Great food and an amazing server! Great beer suggestion and excellent food! The pretzels were unreal! From the moment we walked in the door until we left we were treated amazing! Never had an empty glass and everyone was very friendly! 100% recommend for a lunch!! Try the lobster Mac and cheese huge chunks of lobster in every bite! And the BLT is delicious!!
Wow! I have never had a Burger that was this amazing, tasty, and delicious.. . Sat at the bar here in Ceasars Palace to enjoy the last period of playoff hockey.. . Ramon, an awesome bartender who went way out of his way to create an amazing bourbon drink, shared with us some of the cool insider stories that understandably has led to a terrific camaraderie here in the restaurant.. . Staff is all pleasant, energetic, friendly and really love what they do. Easy to understand when you hire right and inspire the best.. . Ok, enough of the overkill, but seriously this place is a lot of fun. Good British Pub food with the master touch of Gordon Ramsay.. . Definitely check it out if you come to Las Vegas and consider sitting at the bar if you're solo or just the two of you.. . Awesomeness.
i'm a HUGE fan of GR's since day 1 of 'hell's kitchen', i enjoy his US and UK shows, so of course when i went to vegas 4/28-5/3, i HAD to go to at least 1 of his vegas restaurants.. my husband and i ended up choosing the pub and grill at caesar's palace for it's casual attire and atmosphere, in fact, it was planned to be our 1st official activity in vegas, i just couldn't wait to go to his place! when we arrived hungry, i didn't even mind the 1 hr wait (we didn't do reservations cuz we were unsure of how long it would take to get to the restaurant), and i thought it was cool they text u when ur table is ready (never experienced that b4 w/ a restaurant lol).. and to be in his restaurant was AMAZINGLY wonderful and exciting for me, being such a fan! but quite honestly, u'd never know that this was his restaurant, his face isn't everywhere. there's no GR merchandise section that i saw. his name is in the restaurant name and his pic in the menu, but otherwise, it's like any other place to eat/drink! personally, i was hoping there would be a merchandise section cuz i'd love to have a shirt or souvenir of his :) anyway, i initially savored every minute the sec we walked into the restaurant! however, the server sucked tho. my husband failed a few times trying to get her attn (doing the standard method, but exaggerated so u'd think she would've noticed!), she was so busy and scattered, she never paid us any attn, not even the minimum cuz our water/my sprite was never checked on. i had to ask the guy who brought my food to ask her to get me a sprite refill lol.. that was pathetic.. . . w/ my food, i was kinda disappointed too :/// i got the ny steak w/ fingerling potatoes and replaced the asparagus (ewwww) w/ carrots. considering how expensive it was, u'd expect absolute perfection on a plate! well, a few carrots were too raw/hard to even put my fork into, and the potatoes were only a handful amount so the side dishes were really a let down ://// BUT the steak was delish! :)))) the plating for the steak sucked too tho! GR is all about presentation & plating so i think he may be disappointed to find out my dish came out very messy (or idk, maybe that's how the dish is supposed to be plated??)... see, the carrots and potatoes were randomly scattered on the plate *carelessly* imo, and the steak had a potato and carrot underneath it, like the steak was just plopped on top of the potatoes and carrots :/// i just tweeted pics of the dish from b4 and after i ate it to show the plating, and the raw carrots and fatty steak part i left behind.. dunno if he'll respond at all, but i thought i'd at least notify him of how things were done.. i also got the potted triple chocolate trifle which i LOVED. it was various layers/textures of dark, milk, and white chocolate :)) w/ a couple small cookies on the side. . . so i had very mixed feelings about my 1st and likely only experience at a GR restaurant as i doubt i'll have the chance to go back to vegas again (or any other location where his restaurants are). i really did have high expectations w/ his location b/c it's GR! he's all about perfection w/ taste and plating, and of course, he's anti-raw foods lol.. and then there's the horrible server i mentioned b4 who really was frustrating, if i wasn't in such a great mood about the 1st nite in vegas, i would've complained more outwardly at the time, right now, i'm wishing i had... will try to post pics of everything.
Oh My Goodness! Gordon Ramsey needs to place the same expectations on his restaurants that he does on others. . . Service was so slow, we could have walked to the food court and grabbed something before we got drinks. Then another 30 mins to get out food. Good thing we were in good company. . . My husband had the Bangers and Mash and he was greatly disappointed in the quality of food.  I had the cheese burger, which looked great but it was very dry. . . Needless to say, we won't be coming back and we definitely don't recommend it!!
I haven't dined at any Gordon Ramsey places and if this is any indication, I'll take a pass. . . The service and decor was fine enough, but their food is so overpriced and not so good. Their charcuterie appetizer was so lacking in flavor and their pates were hard as a rock.  So disappointed. One only highlight of the meal was the pretzels with very spicy mustard. . . The fish n chips were ok (better be for $27) and their chicken curry (wish this was better explained by the waiter) wasn't what I had expected. . . For a pub too, what a standard and boring beer draft menu. At least bring in Fullers! Sheesh. . . Skip this place and head to Central, Caesars 24 hr restaurant, located in the lobby.
My party were treated terribly here. We ordered a round of drinks which arrived very slowly. Much later we ordered our meal. When we tried to order a second round of drinks (light beer, not liquor) we were told we were too drunk!  When we asked to pay for our drinks and leave they tried to charge for the food which after 40 minutes had still not arrived.  When they finally brought the bill for the drinks only we were attended to by numerous staff, something that had been lacking all night.   So many better places to eat in Vegas. Don't go for the flashy celebrity name. Go somewhere with a good atmosphere and friendly service instead. (And where they don't charge $24 for shepherds pie. Ground beef and mashed potato - seriously?!?)
Sooo, I was pretty excited about this place and total fail!!!  I paid 30 bucks for fish and chips that were very bland and not even worth 10 bucks.  I substituted the chips for a side salad and the salad was just dry lettuce with some carrots and snap peas. Not good, don't waste your money at the Pub.
Second visit occurred 5-7-2014. Dined for two with reservations which made wait time excellent as well as food delivery time. I enjoyed beet salad,which was best experience. Pretzels were old tasting and dry. Beef sliders dry and over cooked. Deviled egg filling was very dry and not creamy in consistency; however the vinegar on egg white shells were good. We asked waitress if Mr. Ramsay was involved in restaurant operations and we were advised he most certainly is; however, it would be beneath him to consider "amateur" reviews on Yelp. Waitress indicated the people who work at restaurant are best equipped to know what's good versus customers. . . First visit occurred on 5-4-2014 with group of six. Service took 2 hours but food seemed better, lamb burger was reported by my table as delicious. I didn't order food but reserved my opportunity 3 days afterward.. . I gave this place 2 stars since the waitress' comments suggest there is no place in their business for customer feedback since owner is celebrity chef and has "better things to do with his time than to look at Yelp or hear from amateur food critics.". . Place is not worth the expense.
I just had THE WORST MEAL I HAVE EVER HAD in Las Vegas. My wife and I have been here twice before and had good meals, though the last one was nothing to write home about. I brought my father in law here while our wives were dining elsewhere.. . Except for the Calamari which were good, everything else was horrible. The chicken wings were meatless (a vegetarian could have eaten them for all the chicken they had). The prime rib was so tough that my father in law sent his back. I nibbled at enough of mine that I didn't send it back, but you could tell it was old, tough, dog food grade meat.. . Gordon Ramsay should be ashamed of himself! His next Kitchen Nightmares should be filmed in his own bloody restaurant!  Not only will we not be back at this establishment, but we are far less likely to go to his other restaurants - just in case they've gone downhill in a similar manner to this one.
Adam in the bar is AMAZING!! You have to go sit with him and get their version of a mint julep OR and Ramsay tonic!!! So so good! And their deviled eggs appetizer! OMG must go.
It would be 0 stars if possible. I've never been to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant before, but for our last night in Vegas (all other meals were great!) my girlfriend and I decided to check out his Pub and Grill in Caesar's. Hands down worst meal of the strip. Service was friendly but every course was wayyyyy over cooked. Buyer beware, if you want medium order extra rare! Smallest wings of my life and as dry as the nearby desert, medium rare prime rib more like well done, over salted everything, and medium strip steak was well done and charred (sorry for repeating myself but overcooked is the theme of this review). The manager offered to "take care of us on our next meal here," but there is no way I'll ever be back, or any Ramsay joint for that matter. Sorry Gordon, you lost me at hello.
This was the worst foodie experience I have ever had in Vegas. There is amazing food everywhere you turn in Vegas, except here. . . First of all, the food is so bad. I can't believe Ramsay would even want his name associated with this restaurant. We tried multiple dishes on the menu including the caesar salad, beef pie, scallops, and lamb. The caesar salad had overly fishy, bad tasting anchovies which you could barely taste under the dressing the salad was drenched in. The beef pie was not only much too salty, but too peppery as well. The scallops must not have been cleaned because eating them was like eating a handful of sand on the beach. They were also in a chowder type broth that was mostly potatoes with no flavor. The lamb was nothing special and irony tasting. We enjoyed nothing except our cocktails, which by the way were excellent. Guess this is the place to only grab a drink. I would expect food like this at Denny's, but not at an extremely high priced restaurant with Ramsay's name attached to it. . . The best part if the story is that this awful foodie experience took place on a night that Ramsay was actually visiting the restaurant, but he clearly wasn't watching what was going on in the kitchen and was preoccupied by fans. If we couldn't have a somewhat decent meal with him there I would sure be afraid to try this place when he isnt there. . . This really should be his next stop on Kitchen Nightmares.
Worst restaurant experience in my week in Vegas!. . I recently visited Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill and was very excited to try it.  Our visit started out very well.  Our server was extremely professional and friendly.  It ended there, however.  I was with a party of four and we all ordered.  I ordered the lamb burger and couldn't wait to taste it, which I never did do.  I specifically asked if the burger had lettuce on it and was told no.  It had some on it when it came and the server stated that it wasn't supposed to be like that so he took it back.  This would have been fine, however, somehow my meal got "lost" due to our server needing to wait on a table that had a language barrier.  So I sat while my whole table ate and finished with still no food. When I flagged down our "new" server, he seemed not to know what was going on.  I asked for the manager, who was also not aware of the issue.  When I told her, she did offer to get me a meal, but by then it was too late.  I was not about to eat while everyone else waited for me.  She did comp our drinks, but I would have rather had my burger and enjoyed my meal.  . . I was so disappointed because I am a big fan of Gordon Ramsay, and if he puts his name on a restaurant, I expect it to be great.  The others in my party did enjoy their meals.. . So, ultimately, I left hungry and annoyed!
The interior deco was a tribute to the motherland, England. Made to look like an English pub. You won't believe how casual and laid back this place is, in comparison to its neighbors at Caesar's Place. Peter was our host and he reminded us of Mario Lopez! . . I really like the pork rillettes (despite mistaking it for fish initially). It had none of the porky taste and looked as white as fish meat. Topped with strings of sweet caramelized onions. It was the perfect finger food to wash down with a pint of beer. We had a good pint! I can't recall its name but if a non-beer fan can love it, I am sure most people will too! It had a dark oaky color, wasn't very strong but had slightly bitter aftertaste. . . The Deviled egg was a miss for me though my friend seemed to liked it. To each his own. . . It's definitely one of Ramsay's biggest restaurant in Vegas and Hell Kitchen was shot there too. Interest ambiance but nothing beats the real deal English pub for sure!
There was a huge line at Hash House A Go Go, so we wondered over and decided to try Ramsey's.  The fish and chips were a real let down, and my brothers pot pie was child sized. My uncle and dad weren't impressed either. We won't be back. Wolf Gang Pucks in the MGM is stellar (try there).
Liked the atmosphere but  that as about it. I am not a big portion guy but thought the size of my order didn't match the price that came with it.  Overall nobody at our table was impressed and luckily me and my bro were buying or the two old guys with us would still be complaining. Big fan of Mr. Ramsay but my experience at this place was less than what I was expecting.
Went there on a Saturday night and was able to find seating at the bar for a few drinks before dinner with relative ease.  Had dinner there after a long day of gambling and split a bunch of plates with friends.  Everything was great and I wish I would have went back again for a more focused experience.  . . Definitely way better than Bobby Flay's place in CP.
My sisters and I came here for Super Bowl Sunday.  It was $100.00 per person to get in, unlimited food and drinks.  The food was delicious.  I didn't drink but my sister's did and said the drinks were good.  The decor is nice, the workers uniforms are ridiculous, lol, I felt bad for them, but it is a very English look.  . . The big bonus to this was though that on occasion Gordon Ramsey himself comes in to check on things, and at the time we were there so was he.  My sister is a big foodie and we were stoked that she got to get a picture with him.  He is very nice and personable in person although I didn't get too close because I couldn't get past my terror and PTSD of watching him scream at people on TV.  lol.. . Overall it is a great place.  I'd definitely go back both for the Super Bowl, or just for dinner or lunch.
With so many great eateries on Vegas Strip, this place just taint Gordon Ramsey's name.  A hip pub joint that serves food which my mom can make better at home.  We were seated around 1PM on a Friday, and our server did not come over until 20 minutes or so after.  Then after he took our order, he came back and "confirm" our order.  Basically, he forgot our second entree order.  Anyhow, after waiting close to half an hour, I was about to blow a gasket.  I asked the waiter to check on our food, he said it is coming.  He served our entrees first before our mussels and clams appetizer.. . The mussels tasted like mud, not fresh and tender.  It was just very musky.  The bacon burger was just ok, nothing real special about it.  It was under favored.  For $19, I expected a bit more.  Then the Steak and ale pie also lacked in favor.  Marie callendar's chicken pot pie tasted better than this.  I still can't believe I tipped the server.. . The restaurant decor was nice, but the food and service really stinks.
I just don't see the big deal. Maybe because it's in a fancy resort, and has the Gordon Ramsay name, but I just don't find it that great.. . Prices are super expensive for what you are getting, which is basically a nice craft burger and craft beer.. . I got the fish and chips, and while they were good, they were definitely not the "best" fish and chips I had ever gotten.. . Bottom line, the food is average. You are not going to be blown away by the food. You will be blown away by the price though. 4 of us spent $100+ after food and drink. Then again, it is Vegas, so I guess it should be expected.
We tried the Pub and Grill on our latest adventure and loved it!  Not sure why all the bad reviews here.  We were greeted and given a table right away, 11 pm on a Friday night.  Our server came by, got a drink order while we looked over the menu.  I ordered the Beet Salad and my fiance got the Burger.  Both were absolutely delicious!  We also got the sticky toffee pudding for dessert and loved it.  We had a great experience here and would not hesitate to come back again.  Discounted pricing for Total Rewards members is nice also.  As were were seated near the bar, we were able to see ESPN and catch all the scores.  Check it out, you'll be glad you did.
The fish & chips were to die for! The best I've had since London.  Adam was our server & he was outstanding!  A++++
My husband and I made dinner reservations for Gordon Ramsay's Pub with high expectations.  My God, after watching KN & HK, you'd expect nothing but the best.  Unfortunately, we were sadly disappointed.  We were there at 6:00 on a Monday night for dinner.  The place was nearly empty.  So whom do they sit next to us, when there are dozens of open seats everywhere?  A table of 4 loud drunks.  The server came up to us immediately, but that was the high point of the evening.. . We ordered fish & chips and prime rib, both of which also came to us immediately.  My fish was cold, my fries were cold and greasy, my husband's prime rib was nothing special.  His vegetables were cold and mushy; his mashed potatoes cold and tasteless.  When we questioned the server, he said that the fish & chips were made "only" 5-10 minutes before our order.  If he admits to 5-10 minutes, I bet on at least 30.  I thought that Gordon's restaurants always made dinners to order -- at least something as traditional and simple as fish & chips.  How can you screw that up?. . Besides that, the place just doesn't feel and look clean.  The silverware is put right on the table, which in our case was covered with sprinkled salt, a sure sign that the table had not been cleaned between diners.  The uniforms of the servers were wrinkled and mismatched.  I'm not sure what look Gordon was seeking, but the servers clearly do not have the same "vision".. . When we complained to the manager, he was dismissive and condescending, making sure to inform us that "Gordon had just been there last week and everything was great".  Well maybe great when the boss is around, but with zero or no quality standards when he is not.. . Bottom Line: Save your money for fish fries at your local Catholic church during Lent.  Gordon's made enough money from hard-working "no counts" like us.
Service was poor. Waiter cleared table of food prior to finishing the meal. Waitress was non-existent and was somewhat rude. Waited over 10 mins for check and rarely saw her after she took my order. Took another 5 for her to pick up the check and return it for signature. . . Ordered the madras chicken which was good but very spicy. . . I'm guessing if Gordon was here tonight there would be a lot of profanity as the service wouldn't come close to meeting his high standards.
I was very disappointed this last time around.the first time I went it was heavenly from the food to the service everything was top notch, so much so I insisted this time it was one of first stops in Vegas. I was dissapointed from the service to the prime rib, when we pointed out it was too dry to eat she asked if we wanted a Togo bag. We never got a replacement napkin that she had initially dropped .. It never got better.  So sad
Decided to check this place out on our way out. Couldn't have been happier! This place is so awesome. Our food was perfect and we had the sweetest/coolest server ever. I forgot her name, but she was super cute and was from Cuba? . . Anyway, this place made me want to try more of Ramsay's spots :) Check it out. You probably won't be disappointed.
Good food, good portions.  Granted it is slightly expensive, we'll worth it.  Our table had the red wine braised short rib (probably best dish of the four we ordered), diver scallops, fish and chips, and blt sandwhich.  The short rib was extremely tender and had very food flavor.  Service was excellent as well.
As a fan of all things Gordon Ramsey, we decided to pop in here for dinner. We went into it wanting to enjoy the experience and have the mind frame of "let's order whatever we want, money doesn't matter". But that didn't last long. . . The decor is really cool. It's an awesome cozy place to grab a drink or dinner. Again, if money isn't an issue. .  . Browsed the drink menu, $15 a pop. Ordered a drink each. I had the Goodbye Blue Sky. It was tasty, yet reminded me of pomegranate flavored Emergen-C. For $15 it should have come in a proper tumbler glass instead of some dinky glass. . . Instead of ordering entrees, decided to split 2 appetizers.   A Scotch Egg, and the Pie Sampler. I was expecting the pie sampler to come in decent sized custard dishes. Instead they came out in this weird wooden rack that could have held 5 of these tiny dishes. Had they been the custard dish I was expecting, 3 dishes would have easily filled this.  Instead you are left with this massive wooden rack and these tiny awkward dishes.  Kind of cool presentation, I guess?  But really just stupid, and pretentious.  The steak pie was by far the best tasting. The Shepherd's pie, which the waitress suggested had a strange taste and smelled like dirty socks. The chicken pie was decent, yet comparable to one of those frozen Marie Calendar's pot pies you buy in bulk at Costco.  The Scotch egg however was delicious and perfectly cooked.. . All said and done, $80 to not even be full or drunk.
Had the potted salmon and filet mignon. Soo gooddddd. Place is a bit loud but it's supposed to have that pub vibe. No waiting :) Waitor was really helpful and nice. It's inside caeser's palace. Will definitely come back for more!
Raul was our bartender and server! Loved my drink - it was the Ramsay Tonic. Fresh, lovely and perfectly mixed. My husband had a beer and Carmel Salted Apple and he thought they were great! Louie the manager stopped by to check on us. So nice! I had the sliders were super delish and the hubs had short ribs and the bowl was licked clean. :-) I also enjoyed the Santa Barbara Chard exactly what it should be. The energy in the room was fun and happy. We'll be back!
I got surprised with lunch from my boo at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill when I was just here for my birthday.  The service was phenomenal.  We ate at the bar and had such a lovely time chatting with the bartender.  She was great with my man's allergy concerns and was very honest about helping us pick the best things to eat.. . I had the lobster mac n cheese and split pea soup.  SOOOOO Good.. . We got surprised with the spotted dick --insert juvenile joke here-- for dessert.  The warm bread pudding with ice cream was to die for.  Honestly, who needed lunch food.  Just get this!  . . It is pricey.  But honestly, EVERYTHING nice in Vegas is pricey now.  Not to mention, food like this is starting to look cheap in comparison to the price of 2 drinks at a club.  $40-$60 for 2 drinks?! Seriously people!?!?! WTF!  --endrantonsoaringvegasdrinkprices--
We stopped in for a beer and were welcomed by the bartender. Lots of beer on tap, good variety, something for everyone. I am not even a beer expert but I found a beer I liked.  . . We tried the calamari and it was very fresh and came with tartar and cocktail sauce. . . Service was attentive and the couple next to us wanted a sit down dinner. The bartender walked all the way to the front and got the hostess, walked back with her and introduced them to the hostess. Can't get better than that kind of service!
Big fan of Gordon Ramsey's Bugr and Steak and decided to stop by here for lunch. What a mistake. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and their burger from the bartender. After a few minutes the bartender just started wiping glasses. We were pretty irritated and got up, the bartender noticed and said he forgot and apologized. He put in the order and brought our drinks. We waited for about 20 minutes and our bartender disappeared. I needed a refill on my beer but we couldn't get anyone's attention even though we were sitting front and center in the bar area. . . There was one bartender who was glued to the television watching the soccer game. We were finally fed up once and for all. I reminded the bartender that he wasn't sitting in his apartment watching TV and to bring my bill (for 1 beer). Also canceled the burger. What's even sadder is that the bar seating around us was empty and a complete mess. On a better note the pizza in the food court next door was quick and delicious. Overall, Ramsey shouldn't act like he has such high standards and rip apart restaurants on Kitchen Nightmares then have his name on a place like this. Too much expansion to create restaurants for contestants to work at from Hells Kitchen without proper training.
Another Gordon Ramsay experience.. I have to admit I liked the food here better Gordon Ramsay Steak.  Had the short ribs.. a sucker for them anytime they are on the menu.. and my husband and daughter had the fish and chips.  I will take the short ribs here over the steakhouse anytime! The fish and chips.. I expected more from the "chips" seemed like frozen french fries to me!  But alas.. the toffee pudding makes everything better.  Two down one to go.. Burgr see you next time I'm in Vegas!
I popped in here one week-night, when there were no vendor-sponsored blow-outs lined up for the conference I was attending. The place was crazy busy, and the two hostess babes on duty looked me up and down, and basically said 'no way!' I walked on back to the bar, and eventually wrangled a barstool. I eventually managed to  order what sounded like an intriguing cask-aged 'London Style' Porter from the over-whelmed, inattentive barmen-- which at $13 a pint, was sort of like a watery stout, not any Porter I have previously encountered.  I next decided to double-down and ordered the Pub Pretzels, Pub Burger, and chips.  The Pretzels were pretty good.  The burger was a huge, decently cooked patty, while the 'chips' were mildly soggy steak fries.  So, basically $40+ for a burger and a beer left me feeling liked I had been conned -- even by Las Vegas standards!  If you want pub food, go see The Man -- Hubert Keller's Burger Bar (or even Fleur) further down The Strip will treat you right, and send you on your way happy!
No no no. This goes on the skip it list. . This is the second GR place I have been and had bad food and experience. And I'm a fan!. Maybe I was hoping for too much???. The food, just burgers and salad took forever to come out. The staff was confused and seemed disoriented.. Plenty of other places to eat at...move on...nothing to see here.
