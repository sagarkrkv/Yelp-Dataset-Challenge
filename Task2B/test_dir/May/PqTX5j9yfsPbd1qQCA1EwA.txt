Don't let them trick you into booking a table in a small room w/ a pop up 2ft high stage where they say Snoop Dogg will be performing - he performs on the main stage & you can get in there for free!. They offered us a table for 1 $ price but said we wouldn't be in the same room that he performed in but for basically double the price we could not only be in the same room as Snoop performing we could have a table beside the stage! Not!. Amazing how the day of his 1st show they still had a table beside the stage for lil ole us... I / we should have known better.
Was on a list to get in free if there by midnight. We show up, they make us wait in a line off to the side while 6 workers socialize with each other. When they finally call for us they say we are EIGHT minutes late so it would be 40 dollars each. I don't think so sweetmeat. I know you THINK you are important behind that stand wearing Candies and some polyblends. I laughed in her face and we went somewhere else and spent a lot of money. NEVER again to that overrated snob scene..
Been to Tao many a Vegas night over the years and it's still one of my favorite clubs to go to on the Strip. The reason I like it is because Tao offers a little bit of variety in music. It's not all EDM like in Marquee & Hakkasan's main rooms. It plays hip hop, top 40, club mash-ups and electronic music and I like the change of pace. I feel it's needed... Of course it all depends on the DJs and some of our friends from HS in the Los Angeles area are the ones that provide the soundtrack to those memorable Vegas nights at TAO. DJ Skratchy is a friend from HS and we all support the venues he spins at and he used to spin at Tao and Tao beach in the past. He's a resident DJ at some of the best clubs in Hollywood, Miami and Las Vegas I wish they would book him more at TAO cause the music he spins is great. Cant lie, I'm biased but let how the crowd moves to the music be your proof. My favorite Vegas DJ.. . Saturday night resident DJ Vice is also a friend from HS and his reputation speaks for itself. He brings energy and definitely moves the crowd. You gotta see him for yourself. He plays it all and his timing is impeccable. Definitely a master at his craft.. . I recommend getting bottle service to have a real memorable Vegas experience at TAO. Anywhere from the side room, balcony, main dancefloor, walkway and elevated sections will have different pricing. My friends and I have gotten bottle service several times and it's been classic. That's definitely the way to go. Regular pay line will have you waiting a long time. Either get on a guest list, get there super early, of course get bottle service or be a hotel guest. Those are the easiest ways to get in without too much hassle. Bring your patience. Money talks. This is Vegas.. . ps - Ms.Joey Williams is absolutely the most beeautiful, not to mention, the best dancer/bottle popper in all of Las Vegas. Period. End of story.
IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS I WOULD HAVE. THIS WAS THE WORST NIGHT CLUB EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD. I would type in all caps (out of outrage) but that would just hurt to look at. . . We got in quick cuz we got put on the guest list so that was the only good thing of the night. The open bar for ladies from 10:30-11:30 that night was kind of wack, but expected I guess (only mixed well drinks). Also, IT WAS OVERCROWDED. Like I am 100000% sure they went over capacity. There was zero space to dance at all. All I could do was bob my head. I literally could not even breathe. Third, people were pushing and shoving like no other. I almost cracked a rib! Fourth, there are rude & grimey people in this club.. UGH. Some guy called me a "fxckin b!tch" just because I asked him nicely not to push me. Then someone groped my @$$ on my way out. The layout of this place is TERRIBLE. The staff is unfriendly and also RUDE. . . Needless to say, I'm never coming back to Tao ever again.
We came here on a whim on a Friday night. We had a great time here and our night went on without a hitch. All of the staff we interacted with were extremely friendly, professional and helpful. We didn't have to wait in line, even though we weren't on any guest list. We paid about $30 for myself and my boyfriend to get in, but it was still cheaper than voodoo lounge and looked like a much more well dressed and classier crowd here too. . . The drinks are steep for normal standards, but they are actually a lot cheaper than hakkasan. $14 for a shot of patron silver and $11 for a vodka tonic at Tao VS. $25 a drink average at hakkasan. . . I loved the club's theme and the upscale asian inspired decoration. They had sexy red chandeliers over the bar area in the dance room. The giant Buddha sculpture was a dramatic touch. I think they had about 3 flights of stairs to get up to the dance floor, but it wasn't anywhere near as exhausting as hakkasan's millions of stairs. . . The dance floor was packed to the max, but the perimeter of the club had a lot of areas that you could stand, dance or relax with your date and enjoy your drink. I loved that we didn't have to push our way to get around and we were able to stand anywhere we wanted to without being ushered out of the way like they do at hakkasan. It was well ventilated in some areas but closer to the dance floor, the air was thicker and it was stuffier. . . They had EDM music spinning most of the night and we enjoyed dancing to a lot of it. The DJ did a great job pumping up the energy of the club. . . The women's bathroom is located upstairs and there is a bit of a wait, but it's nice to be able to look down at the club's dance floor from the banister.
