So excited to come here tonight! Love Gordon Ramsay! It lived up to all my expectations and more. The service was fantastic and our waitress was amazing! My husband and I both had incredible burgers, a great milk shake and the sweet potato fries were killer! I'm already craving it again! 5 star meal and with water we got out the door for 60$. Not bad dinner for 2!
I ordered the farm burger and it was tasty! Ordered the sweet potato fries with the sugar powdered vanilla and those were great too. Customer service was great as well. I would go back!
We ate here as we were staying in the Elara which was connected to the miracle mile shops and Planet Hollywood. The service was on point but you could tell they definitely are trained to up-sell drinks and side items. Their food was excellent and this was probably the best burger I have ever had/will have in a while. I definitely recommend this restaurant should you be in Las Vegas!
It was kinda crowded, so there was a wait to get in, but we left our number so we could walk around while we waited for a table. They texted us when the table was ready, which I thought was pretty cool. . . I had the Euro Burger which was soooooo good! I love the different flavors that I'm not used to having in a burger. The truffle fries were amazing too! I thought it was a lot of food that you get...didn't even come close to finishing it.  Wish I had room for more though because I wanted to try the desserts that everyone raves about. Will definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas and will be sure to have dessert!
I was in Las Vegas for work and wound up dining alone at Burgr. From the minute I sat down, the experience was an amazing one. I couldn't decide between the many delicious sounding burger combinations, and asked for advice from my waiter- he didn't hesitate before giving me info on my different options. I ultimately decided on the chicken burger with blue cheese and spicy mayo and a blood orange martini. The drink arrived quickly and was the perfect amount of sweetness without being overpowering. I was sitting at the counter in front of the open kitchen and watched as all of the food was cooked and plated- as I watched, I couldn't help but wish I had ordered more than just a burger. I commented on this to the Chef de cuisine Christina, saying how delicious everything looked. No sooner did my burger arrive than I was treated to a sampling of all of the amazing looking sides I had been watching come out of the kitchen. Each one served with a different dipping sauce, the three different types of fries, onion rings and poppers did not disappoint- they tasted even better than they had looked! And my burger was also the right choice- while not as spicy as I had expected, the burger was perfectly moist and the toppings all came together well. Dining alone can be a bit daunting, but between the fantastic service and delicious food, Burgr made my day!
My husband and I are a big Gordon Ramsey fan so we couldn't miss eating at one of his restaurants. I must say I absolutely loved it! The whole experience! The service is great, the ambience is busy and noisy (it's vegas baby) and the food... Ahhh the food! Delicious! Well made and fun! My favorite thing now is shake #4 The creme brulee pudding + Oreo Shake + Oreo cookie!! Oh my! Absolutely wonderful! The type  of thing you never forget and crave all the time!!  We will be back to vegas on July and I can't wait to go to Burgr again!!! Thumbs up Gordon!
The farm burger was so good. My friend also had the euro burger which was also good. The strawberry shake was to die for.  The services was also good.  Overall everything was excellent. I will go back soon.
We started off if a party of eight which is normal in #Vegas. The hostess solo us up into two booths back to back. After sitting we asked if they could combine 3 tables and they did. Our server came by and explained  the drink menu and then disappeared. Someone in our party had to raise her hand to get our server's attention. She came and took out order after another delay.. . Finally we ordered and out food came. The sweet potato fries was the best I've ever had and others at the table agreed. The burger was probably one of the best I've ever taste. The food gets 5 starts but the service was non existent...hopefully it was just our server and not representative of the entire staff... Overall I'll return and surely recommend.
Had the farm burger and truffle fries, honestly it was "meh."  waited over 40 minutes at the table and when the food came the burger was so sub-par . Meat was tough, flavor was simple. I swear In-N-Out makes a tastier, and juicier burger than this. Truffle fries tastes rubbery, were cold and all you could taste was cheese. Don't come here its not worth your money and time, there are far better restaurants in Las Vegas to pour your money into.
My experience here at Gordon Ramsay exceeded my expectations!! Let me just tell you that you will not be disappointed!. . This place is easy to find as it is located near the entrance of the casino at Planet Hollywood. As you wait in line, you'll be able to look at the touch-screen menu and gaze at the fiery decoration.. . We ordered:. . 1. Euro Burger ($16): Truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula and oven roasted tomato. I actually preferred this over my own burger. This is probably my favorite one! The truffle was spot on along with the flavors of the burger. The goat cheese was a great complement to the meat and truffle. Just imagine a perfection infusion of savory flavors leaving you wanting more!! (5/5). . 2. Farm Burger ($15): Duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, and fried egg. Frankly, the only reason I chose this was because I was attracted to the idea of duck breast bacon. It wasn't that special as it just tasted like any typical bacon. However, the burger was delightful and delicious. But overall, I was eyeing my boyfriend's Euro Burger all night hehehehe. (5/5). . Service was friendly and very attentive. Will I come here again? Of course! I want to order my own Euro Burger next time and maybe run into Gordon Ramsey himself! The staff told us that he visits the location every so often. :)
Best elongated dog I had!! Party of 2  we ordered 1 burgr and my fresh roasted chilli dawg took about 40minutes to get served!!! Yes 40 minutes!!! Took the whole "fresh" literal. I guess worth the wait when you are not starving.
So...we show up on Cinco de Mayo and there was an hour and a half wait for a table.  We told them we just got married at the Cosmo and suddenly were told it would be about two minutes for our party of five.  Pretty awesome start.  But that's not the good part.  I was ambivilant.  But from our server, to our cocktails, to our meals and the champagne provided gratis by the manager - everything was top notch.  Started with a great server - wish I could remember his name but he got married last September so I hope you know you are - who gave us some recommendations for cocktails.  We chose the Jalenpeno Ritas.  Oh my gosh.  FABULOUS.  Like the Best.Cocktail.Ever.  We ordered the jalepeno poppers (Incredible), the Vietnamese app (first time for anything like this for me and WOW), and the onion rings (homemade like everything else and done so well).  Nothing wasn't delish.  And then the burgers.  My new husband had the Euro Burger which he described as the best burger he had ever had.  And that's something since he's had A LOT of burgers.  I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger.  Deliciousness.  We are so glad my Man of Honor suggested this as an alternative to Mexican Food on our special day.  It really couldn't have been better.
Get here early if you want lunch...there is def a wait!. Food was good but nothing extra special...a little disappointing because it is a Ramsay place.. Service was very slow but nice...burgers are good but just not amazing. I suggest getting onion rings and fries....the onion rings are really good!!
Don't walk in hungry because you may starve before you're served. We waited 35 minutes for chicken sliders and a hog burger. Both were excellent -- juicy, cooked to perfection, great condiments. The sweet potato fries were dusted with powdered sugar and served with a jalapeno mayo with honey. Way, way too sweet for our tastes and not enough heat.  However, our server happily switched out that condiment for homemade catsup and siracha mayo and both were excellent. Finally a word about the skimpy waitress uniforms.  Horrible.  Too low cut, too short, too tight, holes in the seams, too much T and A. This is not a showgirl venue.  I just want an honest burger without sexism.
Best burger of my life.  But seriously,  best ever!  I had the uber cheeseburger.  Amazing.  We also had the parmesan mushroom fries with garlic aoli.  Just deliciousness.  Probably overpriced , but it's Vegas and I was on vacation.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  The wait time for a table was short.  I would definitely go back for another burger and fries . Only next time, I would save room for the toffee push pop dessert.  It looked amazing but I was too full.
My amazing husband and I took a fantastic getaway for two vacation to Vegas and as Ramsey fans we HAD to try one of this brands. Of course as a last minute trip we didn't get to his fancier restaurants, but a burger, ahem, burGR would have to do :) . The wait on this particular day was 30 mins, which I have heard is amazing .  Of course if you're an elite diamond member you get to pass the line all together and get first priority. :)  If you have to wait in line...hopefully it's not a sweltering day outside because standing next to a wall of fire is HOT! . Once seated you are presented with an iPad that shows you the desserts and alcoholic beverages. There isn't too much, so you don't get too overwhelmed. You're in, service is fast, and you're stuffed. Everything was amazing and prompt and correct! We even scored extra fries! . The atmosphere is amazing but my only complaint is how close you are to the next table. It's close enough to dare conversations...but still close enough to be too awkward. . Definitely recommend this place!
We came in around 11:15 am so we were seated right away and didn't need to wait in line. Our orders were taken right away but after that, waiting for the food took a little too long, maybe around 20-30 mins. . . I have been watching Gordon Ramsay for a long time now so I was expecting great food. I ordered Farm Burger while the hubby ordered the Hell's Kitchen. We both shared the Parmesan Fries with ketchup and truffle aioli dip. The dip was amazing and flavorful. Other than that, everything was okay. Not amazing, not distasteful. The burgers look small but they will surely make you full. We also got the Oreo Shake with Creme Brulee pudding and oreo cookie and it was too sweet for my liking. . . I believe this place is overhyped because of GR's name.
Gordon Ramsay's hamburger restaurant belongs in Vegas. It's a showy affair, with some unexpected surprises and also some gambles that don't pay totally pay off. Much of the personality of this restaurant comes from the TV celebrity chef's personality, and they know it. Ramsay is staring at you from every surface and hangs over the dining room like a potentially not so benevolent overlord. It's a version of upscale cuisine for the masses of food television watchers rather than true food lovers. But watching a spectacle can still be fun if you give in and go with the show.. . We had a group of nine, so we knew there would be a wait. We went at noon on a Saturday, and the wait was about an hour, but they will text you when your seat is ready, so we were able to walk around the casino for awhile while we waited. . . We had still had drinks from our walk when our table was ready, and they allowed us to bring those in and offered to return the glasses to housekeeping (we were staying at the hotel) instead of us having to carry them back, so that was nice. The service was impeccable, with tons of servers and support crew so that glasses were always full, someone was always clearing our table or bringing us something, or smiling at us from their Gordan Ramsay monogrammed uniform. The jeans the men wear actually have his logo on the butts, so Ramsay truly is a marketing every aspect. . . We started with the jalapeno poppers. The menu promised a "fiery surprise," and we were a little worried about what it might be. Turns out they leave all the seeds in one of the jalapenos, so one of them is extra spicy. You just have no idea which one it is. Of course, the person in our group who can't really handle spicy got it, and we got the pleasure of watching his face turn red. We also ordered the sweet potato fries and the Parmesan truffle fries for the table to share. The sweet potato fries are a little too sweet, once they're dusted with vanilla powdered sugar. It becomes a dessert because there's no balance flavor of spice or tang to counter the sweet. It's the burger joint french fry version of sweet potato casserole with marshmallows. The Parmesan truffle fries were good, but I'm spoiled by having tasted truly great versions of truffle fries. I wasn't blown away. The fries are thick cut, so they don't have any crunch. There is a lot more Parmesan than truffle flavor, with soft, mild parm sprinkled like a thick blanket all over the fries. They both come with some special sauces, and I remember one was an herb aioli, but they were literally not very memorable over all.. . I ordered the farm burger and a blood orange cosmo for lunch. The farm burger is topped with duck breast bacon and a fried egg. The flavors are good, and the ingredients seem fairly high quality. The duck bacon was good, and not too, too fatty as duck sometimes can be. It still doesn't get very crispy. The flavor kind of melts in your mouth, with a pleasant amount of fatty feeling. It does that without being too greasy or overwhelming, even with a thick layer of bacon strips. The egg was cooked a little too long and the yolk wasn't runny at all. It all stayed in perfect stacks as I ate through the burger, never once turning into the messy, runny affair a fried egg burger can be. It was good, but part of the fun is the messy, runny yolk that would normally make a rich sauce over the burger. . . Everyone in my party was pleased with our meal. The hot dogs were massive, the soba noodles featured a spicy chicken side. One thing I appreciate is that they don't hold back on the spicy. The other flavors featured on the menu are more about creamy and fatty meat flavors, so the spice is a nice touch, and sharpens some of the meals pleasantly. Just enjoy the show and being over the top, and you'll leave satisfied.
omg, I am going to move to Vegas for this restaurant. Afreakingmazing. My husband and i are huge gordan ramsey so we had to visit. I Had the blood orange Cosmo, truffle fries, farm burger and hells kitchen burger, I think it was all delicious but the farm burger was out of this world! There was a thirty minute wait but it was so worth it! Can't wait to go back to Vegas for another round!!
A very good but, the most expensive burger I have ever had. The restaurant was very nice and had a neat theme. I gave BuRGr four stars for the fact the the food was good and the cool experience. $48 for two beers and a burger with a side of fries. Wow!!
Til this day my husband and I will randomly bring up how amazing the chicken wings were. I still get random cravings for the fish sandwich. This place is a must go to when in Vegas. . . Oh and the jalapeno poppers---- ammaaaazing. They come in these tubes.. . Trust me, it's not just the hype.
If Gordon Ramsay knew what was going on during our meal I'm pretty sure someone would've been fired.  Or is it really all for TV value?  I've been itching to try this place out because compared to Burger Bar which has been operating in Las Vegas for 10 years, has garnered 1800 reviews and 755 photos on Yelp... Burgr has opened for less than 2 years and already has attracted 1,500 reviews and 2,300 photos on Yelp.  I was intrigued.  . . We decided to drop by on a Monday at lunch time to avoid any waiting but our food took 40 minutes to come out.  If you wanna swing by during rush hours, make sure you order a bunch of appetizers already when you get seated.  It was a shame that service took forever because our server was very pleasant.  The fire display at the facade is gorgeous, and the atmosphere is bustling with noise, tv sports and gaming machines.  Not much of a date place, more for a group of friends/family who wanna chat or watch the games.. . Their burger is good, smoky and more savory than your average American burger...but it is tiny!  If I were a big guy 1 burger here (that doesn't come with any sides) will not fill me up. If I were to pitch this burger platter with most burger plates I've been served, it would pale in comparison.  At least put some edible garnish on the plate or something.  Same with the chicken wings (which we ordered without any sauce for my lil guy).  Very poor presentation, although the chicken wings itself were fried perfectly and the meat was tasty even without any sauce.  It was also cool how they prepped the wings, they were wrapped on only 1 bone.  Reminded me of a chicken lollipop. . . My fish sandwich said it was served with salt and vinegar crisps and I was expecting chips.  Instead I got shoestring potatoes that hurt the roof of my mouth when I bite into the sandwich.  Eaten alone, the crisps have a hint of vinegar but with the fish and sauce, it doesn't really add any flavor.  I would've wanted to have lettuce or more pickles to have texture and to contrast against the already fried fish.  The bun and the fish itself though was good.  This is how they keep their prices friendly... they keep the portions small and you have to order sides separately.  When you get your total bill, it's still large, especially when you order their $4 soda.  (And remember you'll need 2 burgers if you're a hungry dude).. . Finally, when we bite into our fries they are hard.  Not chewy, not tough but HARD.  Hubby tells the server and the kitchen says sorry they can't serve a new batch because there was a problem with the whole batch and offered onion rings instead.  If they know there's a problem, why serve it?  Here's the clincher, the table right beside us gets served the same hard fries, they complain, opt for the onion rings and are as annoyed as we were!  What were they thinking?  That maybe some guests would think hard fries is a Ramsay thing?  That it's ok to serve crap if they don't complain?  Bad call guys, in the TV world, you would be fired.. . And my last little beef is with their placemats.  They are made of a leather-like material that absorbs dirt, ink and most offensively, smell.  Have you ever had a whiff of plastic placemats that don't get cleaned very well?  If you haven't, they smell sour.  And it's not something you appreciate taking a whiff of for 40 minutes while waiting for food.  New placemats please, and don't mess up the fries.
I have a general rule for celebrity chef restaurants: the more obviously it is named after any particular chef, the shittier it is in that chef's lineup. Gordon Ramsay BurGR, then, is obviously pretty damn low on his list of giving-a-shit-ness, given that he has not one but TWO references to himself in the name. There's also the tacky menu cover, which is just a giant picture of himself posing like he's a delighted gay man opening up his first superbly-well-endowed package. This place is total crap. The burgers are shit. The fries are boring. The ketchup tries way too hard (and is shit). The beers were warm(ish). The atmosphere is a cleaner version of a fast-food joint. The saving-it-from-one-star grace is that the workers were very friendly and laid back. But I really would rather spend my money at McDonald's. Or Burger King. Or Jack in the Box. Wherever, just not here.
Had high hopes for this place, but I was pretty disappointed.  My friend has some Platinum Rewards card so we only had to wait a few minutes even though there was quite a long line to get in.  Score!. . We started off with the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Yum - you could definitely taste the truffle.  each got a burger of course.  I wish the fries had been more crisp however.  They also came with two yummy dipping sauces.  $10 for fries is way too much, though.  We all ordered a burger, of course:  Farm Burger (came w/ a fried egg), Euro Burger, and American Burger.  My burger was seriously burnt on the outside even though I ordered their recommendation, Medium Rare.  Ugh.  I would have returned it, but I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for my burger.  My friend had them put the goat cheese for her Euro Burger on the side, but then made the mistake of smearing too much on it before she discovered she hated goat cheese.  :P  . . A trendy restaurant that doesn't deliver.  Not sure why the line is so long - I am assuming these are people who have never eaten there?  I liked Bachi Burger in Vegas much more and it was more affordable.  Burgr charges about $15 per burger and the patty isn't that large (and mine was burnt - did I mention that??).
Went for lunch with husband. I ordered fountain drink ($4), Caesar Salad ($12), your basic cheeseburger ($13), and a shake ($9). Husband ordered a drink, a specialty burger at $18, plus fries ($11), and a shake. . . Everything was fine. Nothing special, I've definitely had better. Some times it was like Gordon Ramsay just wanted to do something "fancy" and it was just annoying. Like he uses Roma tomatoes on his cheeseburger instead of sliced tomatoes.. . He added sliced apples to the Caesar Salad, again a "fancy" creative addition that I barely noticed. Salad was actually best part of meal. . . The shakes were arguably the worst. The first half is pudding. Like real pudding, but the pudding wasn't good, in our opinions, and then the rest of the shake was your typical milkshake that was gone in like 5 slurps. The shake was good, but my portion was automatically halved by having mediocre pudding on top. Sharing is simply not an option for the shakes. . . The fries were truffle parmesan. They were Ok. Again, fancy creative = over the top and I barely had any. The ketchup also tasted different, most likely Gordon Ramsay's own recipe. . . Wouldn't recommend, won't return. But again it is decent quality just not particularly tastey (or, therefore, worth the price).
where should i start ?  took 40 minutes to get my burger , Ok maybe there was a mix at the kitchen , ill let it slide . . taste was barely ok , Fries were hard as if a 2 day old fries that got re-heated.. total was $28-   Burger , Fries & a soft drink . . What pissed me off was the heart burn i got , thru out the night had to have TUMS to try and help ...    . You want a good burger in Vegas go to BACHI , hell, even go to 5 Guys, but do yourself a favor and SKIP Gordon Ramsay's BurGR . . . I doubt Mr. Ramsay knows how bad those fries tasted , i have watched his Kitchen Nightmares show & the way he bashes food quality and taste , had i brought him his own fries he would have spit it right out ...
They do not serve ketchup on burgers but you don't need it. This was the first burger in my life without ketchup. No need because the burger melts in your mouth.
My husband and I are completely sold on this place. It has become a must-stop spot on our Las Vegas trips, so we've been there a couple of times by now.. . First of all, this is a gourmet burger place so don't expect McDonalds pricing. Having said that, this Gordon Ramsay burger restaurant is very affordable to anyone looking for something extra but don't want to go all out and shell out cash for lobster and steak.  I'd say you'll end up spending an average of $25 per person, that's usually our tab, plus or minus a beer or two:) ). Compared to other places around Las Vegas, it really isn't bad because lesser burger places charge about as much and don't leave you nearly as satisfied as BurGR does.. . Speaking of beers, they have some very good ones that are perfectly suited to their burgers, so ask your server for recommendations. I'm usually very happy with the beer here.. . The burgers here are wonderful, nice and juicy, very flavorful thick patties, obviously cooked to perfection.  My favorite burger is the Euro Burger. I simply love the goat cheese/arugula combination. I also really love the Uber Cheese burger.  Cheese, cheese and more cheese! Can't go wrong!  My husband is a big fan of the Farm burger, it comes with a fried egg on top, it's also really good.. . As far as sides are concerned, I think our favorite so far are the sweet potato fries.  It comes with powdered sugar (and they give you the powdered sugar jar sowhen you start losing the top fries with the sugar on it, you can add more yourself) and this delicious honey/jalapeno/mayo dip.  This has completely made me into a sweet potato fry snob, because I have yet to find any that measure up to these ones anywhere else.. The regular french fries .... what I REALLY really really love about those is the CURRY KETCHUP that comes with them!! So good and so addicting!. . (So even if you think it's boring to order "just fries" ..... don't worry.  With this ketchup along, it is far from boring.). . We usually end our meal with the tasty Sticky toffee pudding push pops.  It's a nice portion that fits perfectly in your belly right alongside the meal you just enjoyed.. . Last but not least, the staff is wonderful. Always very friendly and helpful and attentive to your needs. . . Definitely a Las Vegas favorite for us. After writing this review and thinking about these burgers for awhile, I'm kind of hankering for a Vegas trip all of a sudden...............
Always a line waiting outside, but you will find it worthy waiting! Great burgers! And the sweet potato fries are really good, too!
I FINALLY went  today to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR, with some friends visiting from out of town...It was worth the wait.  I ordered the Farm Burger and this was the best burger I have ever had!  I find it funny that an English chef created it.  I am normally NOT an egg on a hamburger fan and especially NOT an over easy egg, but this worked!  I wanted to dislike it so I would be tempted to return...EPIC fail on my part!  The sweet potato fries were awesome, although I couldn't taste any spice in the sauce.  Next time I will stick with water to drink or one of their killer milkshakes, $4 for a small glass of soda, even with a couple of refills is too much money.  But the hamburger and sweet potato fries were so good that I can look past that.  :)
Excited to go to BurGR. Don't go out for burgers all that often, but we loved the ones we ordered - Earth and Farm Burgers. They were juicy and moist, not dried out and just old bread. Truffle Parmesan Fries could have been crisper but were very tasty. Hoped for a wider selection of beers which seemed a bit reserved.
Amazing #BurGR :) The Creme Brule #Oreo #Milkshake is too good for words & I love #Gourmet food but I personally don't understand why anyone would substitute real bacon for #Duck #Bacon ...either way #GordonRamsey is a #Genius
Everything was amazing except the price.
The food is awesome here, if you try anything at all, you must try the parmesan truffle fries and one of the shakes! We ordered the All American Cheeseburger and the 3 cheese burger (cant remember the name exactly) but everything was so good! the service was awesome as well.  The Hostess needs a little more energy though, she yawned way too much sitting at the front and didn't seem to really want to do much, but the servers were outstanding! Will definitely come back.
Ramsay attempts to alter the nature of hamburgers from a completely transparent business perspective. The restaurant is presentable but lacks any trace of authenticity. The condiments of whatever clever burger you order are small and placed in the center of the burger- so if your burger has jalapenos grab some water because you will swallow all of them in one bite about halfway through your burger. Shakes are good, then again it's hard to mess up a shake. Fries are fine. Not worth the money for any burger enthusiast. These burgers deserve a place in a picture but not a place in my stomach.
Earth burger was absolutely fantastic. However, the service was below average at best. Go for the food, not the service and you'll be fine.
Between the fire display as you wait for a table and the elaborate tap system; this place definitely screams "hip & cool". I had the "hells kitchen burger" which was delicious. The chipotle ketchup is really good as well.
Awesome food, drinks and service. Exceeded my expectations. Jalapeno shooters and onion rings were my favorite. The chicken burger was soooo good. Would definitely eat here again.
Ok. I didn't have to pay for this meal. It was a comp gift that was given to me as a wedding present, and will always hold a special place as our first real dinner together as newlyweds. That may influence my opinion a bit. . . We had a choice of a bunch of places, but as a fan of the various Ramsay shows, I kind of wanted to try one of the restaurants of his. We started off for the pub, but the lengthy wait and pushy people cutting in the line to check in was extremely off-putting. We'd admired the BurGR theatrics the night before, so decided to 'slum it up' with a burger instead. Sooo glad we did. . . The only negative about the experience was the very first encounter. Maybe it is the touristy atmosphere of the strip that makes those reservation desks such a harrowing experience, but if not for my hunger, I may have gotten annoyed and left this restaurant too. There is a long line stretching out from the restaurant, which we had patiently stepped in to wait. As I read everything in my line of sight, I noticed that there was a board asking you to check in with the receptionist before waiting, so stepped out to check in on the procedures. The gal gives me this disgusted look and quotes a wait time at me with an attitude, as if I am inconveniencing her by following the damn instructions. I harrumphed back to my spot in line, but was too tired and hungry to want to argue a third restaurant. I found out later that apparently they also do text messages to alert you when your table is ready? I don't know why she didn't offer that as my feet were sore from allthe running around pre/post wedding, but whatever. Every hiccup just helps illuminate the quality of food, as if you can recover from that negativity, you've got to be good! . . Once our delightful server sat us, I felt better. The cocktail menu was fun and high tech and having stood next to the interactive menu board outside for what felt like forever, we already knew our orders. The atmosphere in the restaurant was just as vibrant on the inside as it looked to be from admiring the theatrics from the outside. . . Without worrying about cost, we went full force. I started off with the Gin Green Tea cocktail and we ordered the hummus and truffle french fries as appetizers. I could have ended the meal there. I had been worried about choosing a cocktail over the amazing looking beer list, but I can't resist a new gin based drink. The Gin Green Tea was an explosion of delightful flavors, that perfectly compliment the use of gin instead of trying to pretend it is a last minute substitute for some lesser alcohol. (I may be a bit biased about my gin, but my rum loving husband later agreed that it was the best drink in the house)  The hummus was, in a word, divine. I'd had some lackluster hummus leading up to this meal, and my tastebuds could have died and gone to heaven the minute I tried that perfectly textured, richly flavored concoction. In fact, I want more now, just thinking about it. I wondered about the truffle fries, as I swear I've heard more than one celebrity chef - and maybe even Ramsay - harp on the gimmicky nature of  using such an expensive ingredient on the most mundane things. But it worked well on the fries and balanced nicely with whatever heavenly version of ketchup came with it. Seriously, I've never been so happy to eat fries and ketchup in my life. . . As my fella' made the mistake of texting our Ramsay loving friend the awesomeness of our meal, I took the opportunity to dig heavily in to the appetizers, a decision I do not regret in the slightest. By the time our burgers came out, I was so satisfied I could only manage a few bites. I had picked out the Britannia burger as I love Mango Chutney. It was extremely tasty, but I wouldn't mind trying another burger some time when my stomach isn't already too full to really note the taste of what I'm eating. My only note on the food from eating the leftover burger would be that I feel like I would have liked a bit more chutney. Still, I probably could have asked for some if I'd actually noticed that night and I imagine as chutney isn't a very American thing, most folks probably prefer it on the lighter side. . . Overall, it was a delightful experience that met up to my high expectations. Everything came out extremely promptly, the server was a paragon of efficiency and service, and the food was delicious. I see a lot of folks complaining about price, but for a high end burger joint with a celebrity chef at the helm in the middle of tourist central, it seemed extremely reasonable. The man and I each had several drinks, two appetizers and the burgers for just at the $100 mark, which we were aiming for. We probably won't come back all the time or anything, but I already am looking forward to future date night/special occasions here.
This is a solid 3.5 but I'm a gonna round down because the wait is a little excessive, and on top of that, the service is slow.. . I like their system for handling the popularity, although I'm not sure how well known it is because there always seems to be a huge line. A hostess hovering by said line is willing to take your name and info along with your cell number; the staff will then text you when your table is ready! Easy, peasy. During this time, we headed over to Earl of Sandwich to deal with some of hunger pains. A bit unfortunate for this review of BurGR because the food at Earl of Sandwich was much better! . . Now, I've had similarly pricey gourmet burgers so I didn't find the cost here to be shocking. And given that this is Vegas, the portions are pretty good for the $. No complaints from me on that end. But the burger itself was really "just" okay. Not bad by any means but not so great that I would want to make a special trip out here. Gun to the head, I'd vote for the Farm Burger as my fav--but really, a fried egg makes everything better. . . The use of iPads and technology makes the whole dining experience fun too, but I think the biggest draw of this place, for me, was the milkshakes. We shared the #5 which I believe was the hazelnut pudding and coffee shake. The top is a creamy pudding-mousse that tastes incredible as is, but also amazing when mixed with the coffee milkshake. The presentation leaves something to be desired but I guarantee you it tastes so much better than it looks! I liked this fancy interpretation more than real milkshakes--so much so that I haven't even had a standard one since. The sticky toffee push pop desserts seem to be popular too, but I saw a couple at a nearby table order them and they looked seriously disappointing. I felt bad for them. Stick to the milkshakes (although they will come out with the meal rather than at the end, since apparently in 'Murica we don't consider milkshakes dessert).. . So yeah, unless you're staying at Planet Hollywood or somewhere nearby, I'd probably skip out on BurGR. Or if you're eating somewhere else nearby (I recommend Earl's), then at least visit here for just desserts.
My boyfriend and I made a stop here on our Vegas trip. We were very satisfied with our choice. Our disappointment with Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse included very rude staff and mediocre food (seems to be a consistent criticism amongst the yelpers). However, Gordon Ramsay's Burgr is a whole different restaurant compared to his steakhouse. The service was excellent! Very prompt, professional, and happy! The overall vibe of the restaurant is more laid back and casual with a trendy element in the decor. And this time, the food was great and far more plentiful. We ordered the euro burger, Hell's Kitchen burger, and a Oreo creme brulee shake. The euro burger was so flavorful! The flavor of the first few bites was so delicious, however, it was quite overwhelming and filling towards the end of the burger. I would've preferred it in a slider size. The Hell's Kitchen burger, although not as flavorful as the euro, was excellent! It was not quite as heavy on the stomach as the euro, which made eating the full sized burger much easier. My personal preference would be to have more heat/spiciness from the jalapenos on the HK burger. And the Oreo creme brulee shake was certainly unique and tasty, but nothing special in the way of taste (they have nice straws though!). My overall experience here was great and I would definitely return to try some of their other items. . . Oh and also I was happy because I got to see Christina Wilson in the kitchen! She was the winner of season 10 Hell's Kitchen! I was cheering for her during that season. Happy to see her in Burgr's kitchen!
In a word... Flawless. As (somewhat) expected, BurGr delivered. EuroBurger was delivered hot, cooked to a perfect medium. Sweet bun toasted expertly. Didn't have a ton of time - Service was excellent at the bar (Mark). Will be back - Sweet Jesus, that was tasty... I feel like a should go back to the room and pray. . . Gobs of tap beer also... Spectacular! Funny story: the staff wear Gordon Ramsay bedazzled bluejeans... Ha!
Went here with my family to check out what all of the hype is about. FYI--if you are thinking of eating here anywhere close to a normal eating hour, prepare to wait.. . After reading many Yelp reviews, I decided to go with the Britannia burger and the truffle fries.. . The Britannia burger was decent, though nothing amazing. The meat was seasoned pretty well, but everything else was a bit lackluster. I don't know if it's because I have been in the LA burger scene too long, but I was not impressed.. . The truffle fries were even more disappointing, as they failed to even impart any truffle flavor.. . Another person from my group said that the sweet potato fries were delicious but I did not have an opportunity to try them.. . Overall, this place has average burgers, Vegas prices, and a long wait. Might as well skip it and try something else in my opinion.
I'm really surprised that Gordan Ramsay can put his name on a restaurant like this. I was so excited to finally try this place after seeing it featured on Master Chef. I am sad to say that I am greatly disappointed with the results.. . One positive note about the restaurant was that  the hostess took down our name and phone number to call us when a table was available. Instead of standing in line for 30 minutes, we were able to walk around the casino. . . Ambiance of the restaurant was great. The fire decor at the window was sick and gave the restaurant a lot of character. . . We ordered the Chantarelle Burger, Honey-Pig Bun Bao, and Truffle Parmesan Fries. The food was good, savory, and flavorful,  but definitely not unique enough to justify the steep prices. . . The BIGGEST reason why I deducted 3 stars from the overall experience was because of the customer service. I want to call out our waitress Melissa. I am shocked by her attitude when it comes to serving tables at a Gordan Ramsay restaurant. Whenever we needed her to order or ask her to get us something, she was ALWAYS standing by talking her friends. The lack of service was astounding. Not only was she talking to her friend in the kitchen unseen, but she was always standing nearby our table. I never had to sit by and wait for a waitress to finish her long conversation before asking her politely to take our order. If I wasn't in a party, I would have left her $0 tips. In fact, we thought the food runner served our table much more than Melissa. He never left our water cups unfilled and was always there when we needed something. If there was a way, we would have given all of our tips to the food runner than to our server. . . I wanted to write this review to really call out what terrible service I had at BurGR. Maybe I will give it a chance again and hopefully we will not get the same server.
To start this place made me realize I like ketchup or at least theirs.  I had the uber cheese which was definitely the best burger ever.  It was the best grilled cheese sandwich on top of the best buger.  The boyfriend had the blue burger.  This is that item knocked the score down a star.  This might be the fault of a burger place at home where they have an equally amazing maytag blue cheese burger.  If this was our first time having maytag it would be a 5.
Been here twice, the onion rings are insanely good! The burgers are mehhh...really dry and plain. If your stuck on the strip though and don't want to pay a fortune for food but want a nice restaurant to chill at it's good for that. But if your looking for an amazing burger go elsewhere.
The best thing we ordered was the hummus appetizer.. . For a burger place, that says a lot. We were two vegetarians and two meat eaters eating at Burgr. The place was recommended by a Vegan friend so we thought - hey should make everyone happy! . The hummus was great, though came with some weird veggies to dip with such as green onions? Flat bread was good too though they only gave us 4 little triangles. We had to order more as had so much hummus left over and were charged $4 extra which was a bit steep for more bread. Most restaurants will just bring you more. . . The veggie burgers were very very average. Just a Portabello mushroom cap. I've had better elsewhere. We also ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was recommended by the waitress as one of their most popular and the Chicken Burger. No rave reviews here. The Hell's Kitchen Burger arrived stone cold and underdone (my friend had specified she preferred hers medium-well). We sent it back and the burger was still underdone but we had given up by that point. . . Expect to wait up to an hour or more for you table. Luckily, the hostess will take down your cell number and text you when your table is ready so you can go to the mall or have a drink somewhere. . . Overall: Go eat elsewhere. Don't waste your time.
Burgers by Gordon Ramsay? Surewhy not. My wife and I are fans of Hell's Kitchen and since Ramsay now has three restaurants in Las Vegas, paying a visit was a no-brainer. Gordon Ramsay BurGR is located in the Planet Hollywood near their front entrance to the Strip. As we approached we could tell that there would be a decent wait due to the long line out front. However, this was Las Vegas on a Friday night, so that was to be expected. Thankfully the wait wasn't long and we were seated quickly by our hostess. Their menu has Ramsay's spin on American burger joints. We both had basic cheeseburgers which tasted out of this world! The meat was well seasoned and they were made exactly how we ordered them. We also tried his version of jalapeno poppers which were served in individual shot glasses of ranch. They tasted good and for something that was fried, the pepper and it's stuffed contents tasted fresh. The real standout for our meal was the butterscotch shake! Good lord was that a treat! It was their homemade butterscotch ice cream  topped with their freshly made butterscotch pudding. All I can say is wow!
Presentation meets taste expectation . Must have the furry wings and blue burger. Everything here is delicious. Will come again
Sad, pricey and dirty.   . . A' la carte is another word I would use.  When you order a burgr, you get a burger.  They don't have chocolate milkshakes.   .Sorry!   But.. . If you would like a piece of chewing gum, that they do have...  ...Just check under the table.  Yum.
Food: Hell's Kitchen Burger, Maui Onion Rings, and Stone ruination for the beer.. The burger was great.  I had it "medium" and it was juicy and perfect. It has jalapeno, so it can be a bit spicy for some people and I liked the kick it had.  Maui onion rings was good.  The beer was very good. A little bit bitter, full flavor, just the way I like it.  I'd recommend it.. . Price: For a premium burger, the price was reasonable.  Mine was $13.  Onion rings and fries were too expensive.  They range around $7, just too much.  It is fries and onion rings after all.  The beer was $8, I think.  Worth the price.. . Service: Long line! Once I was seated the waiter came quickly but I think it took 25 min to 30 min to get my "burger".  I know it's not McDonald but unreasonably long wait.  The kitchen staff were full speed...maybe they need a bigger kitchen and more staff.  Friendly service.. . Conclusion: I'd love to go back to try other burgers and fries.  But only when I'm on vacation as the wait is looooong.
Euro burger was fantastic. I don't care what it costs. Was great. This is now my new favorite burger place in Las Vegas. No more Burger Bar.
Possibly our favorite meal in Vegas.. . You start waiting in line next to a big window with fire shooting up.  It gets a bit toasty because, you know, FIRE.  Strange.. . Our server was really nice.. . I enjoyed my Southern yardbird chicken burger.  It came with sharp cheddar cheese, mustard barbeque sauce, pickle and butter lettuce.  It was really well seasoned.. . We also ordered the onion rings and they were pretty awesome, though I wish there were more.. . It's a bit strange we had to wait for a table, since the restaurant seats 200 and we saw empty tables when we walked around it after our meal.
Look.  It's nothing more than a $13-a-burger burger joint. Pretty nice burger. Not the best.
Bland burger. Very disappointing. Long wait, bad service, bland food. Gordon Ramsey would have not been happy i can assure you. Ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and there was very little spice or flavor. Even had the stem of the jalepeno (the rough non-edible part) in there.
As much as we come to Vegas (about once a month), I have never had the opportunity to try Burgr (the hubby isn't a burger fan and would not wait an hour to eat a burger - can't say I blame him though), even though I've been dying to try it (oh, the hype). . . So finally, I get my opportunity! We were staying at Planet Hollywood, so after sending my hubby out to win us some money, I decided to get a Burgr burger to go. It is still a 25 minute wait when you get it to go. That was a bit surprising, considering that is was 12:30am, there was no line and the restaurant was only halfway full. . . There were 3 young girls at the front counter host stand. When I approached them, they were too busy nudging each other and pointing to different girls outfits who were walking by, and then whispering in each other's ears and laughing, to notice I was standing right in front of them. They came to a couple seconds later and one of them greeted me while the other two kept up their charade, oblivious to me watching them. So I just shook my head, placed my order and waited. . . I finally got my treasured Euro Burger to my room, 30 minutes later and my pockets 17 dollars lighter. It was really good. Cooked perfectly - medium rare, with the perfect amount of all ingredients listed on the menu. However, I have had better burgers. I expected there to be a punch in the taste, or for the flavors to stand out in some way that I have never had before, but sadly that wasn't the case. . . I don't believe the burger was worth that much money, but it was definitely a great burger. I wouldn't wait in line either for an hour for it, but if you feel fit to do so, enjoy!
Stayed in Primm for the weekend but HAD to drive into Vegas just to get a Burgr. We were here in January and had the absolute best burger in my life. We had to see if it was too good to be true so we came for a second time and like the first it was not a disappointment. The service today was top notch. Our server Matt Anderson was amazing and the perfect representation of Gordon Ramsey restaurants. Can't wait to be back from California for a 3rd time. See you in July!!
I'm a huge fan of fine dining and am used the formalities required to craft that experience but BurGR actually felt disrespectful.. . If you're a couple, you must stand in a line. They don't accept reservations.  You can't put your name on a list and go sit down in the adjacent hotel seating, you are forced to stand until they can seat you. (Cheeseburgers!!!) I hesitate to assume the line is intentional but once seated, it was clear that the hostesses were unconcerned with seating the many available tables. . . Red-ropes and lines? BurGR felt like a burger shack masquerading as the city's hot new nightclub. But this is Vegas where there are literally dozens of famous and lesser-known culinary gems that deserve our attention. I know GR is world-class chef but why should anyone forgo all that Vegas has to offer to spend the afternoon waiting for the privilege of eating a (albeit interesting) hamburger? . . We got two Hell's Kitchen burgers (served alone with no side) the pork belly buns, a milk shake and a coke and spent $58 before tip. . . Yes, the burger was VERY good (and I think myself a tough critic) but it was still a burger.  BurGR isn't reinventing the burger, it's improving on it. We saw out waitress twice but luckily the bussing staff was on their game.. . I don't mind paying top dollar for a special experience but take my time or my money, not both.
Perfect burgers . I will have a burger Everytime I'm in vegas at Gordon Ramsay's.....
First impression: this place must be good, there's already a line and is not even open!. . Atmosphere:. Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. . . And we had an iPad that showed us descriptions of our drinks... That was really cool. Which leads me to my favorite part of any restaurant establishment.... . Alcohol:. Best drinks in Vegas.. Nuff said.. . Food:. We ordered burgers. Duh.. . And they were good. We got the blue cheese burger and the chanterelle burger with truffle fries. I mean after eating at Guy Fieri's restaurant with his Mac and Cheese burger full of cheese love and gooey goodness, I appreciated the simplicity of Ramsey's  burger.. . Although next time I've got to order that pork burger.. . Service:. Our waitress wasn't bad, but she wasn't amazing. She did her job and really there's nothing to complain about.. . I will definitely be back.
My boyfriend and I had a great experience at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. The menu was well-priced, and the food was delicious,  tasty, and innovative. He ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, I had the fish & crisps sandwich, and we both shared the truffle fries. All were phenomenal, and we highly recommend them. It took a while for the food to come out, but we both thought it was well worth the wait. . . We arrived around 8:30 and were seated within five minutes, but I noticed that we beat a long line of people waiting for tables. I thought the Gordon Ramsay merchandise was pretty cheesy, but that was easy to ignore. . . I recommend this restaurant for anyone who is interested in trying a creative twist to the traditional burger and fries, give this restaurant a go.
After a horrible service at the Sugar Factory, we moved to BurGR and loved it.  It was definitely expensive, however the whole experience was top notch.  . . From the start we were very impressed with their wait system to be seated. They take your cell phone and will txt you when your table is ready.  We had very little of a wait, but it was a nice touch that we could go stand out and enjoy the fresh air on the strip while we waited.. . We had high expectations and although I'm not sure how, they surpassed them.  We eat out a lot and like simple food, so you could say my family are experts at burgers and fries.  We loved the food.  I heard several times from my wife and kids that the burgers were the best they've ever had.  My wife loved the Garlic Parmesan with truffle  sauce.  . . I had read about the sticky toffee pudding desert at another Ramsay restaurant so I ordered those for all of us and everyone loved them.  Their staff was a treat to be with also as they were friendly and top of things, including bringing refills before they were needed.. . BurGR is a top notch place, great service, nice friendly staff and excellent tasting food.  It's no wonder why Gordon Ramsay is so successful as he makes his places the best hands down.
Such a big fan of this place!! We did come at lunch time, so it was an hour and 15 minute wait. As soon as we were seated, we had excellent service. I got my water right away and they were always around to refill it. When we ordered our food, I loved that our waiter said we could have our fries come out before our burgers did, which I was so happy about because I came hungry. We ordered the Parmesan truffle fries which I really liked and a side of Maui onion rings, which I also recommend trying. Both are unique and you won't be disappointed with your order. The portions are definitely big enough to share, so keep that in mind. I ordered the American burger, which I also really liked. Everything about it was really good, there isn't anything I would have changed. I definitely want to go back and try the desserts, since I was too full to try it this time around. The service was great and it was an awesome atmosphere. So happy with my experience and I can't wait to go back again.
For a man who gets his panties in a bunch every time the kitchen lags on getting orders out, his restaurant sure was slow.. . We were told there would be a 25 minute wait.  We waited longer than that.  they pretty much told everyone there was about a 25 minute wait.  If you're standing an additional 4 people behind us, and we were told it would be 25 minute wait, i'm pretty sure you will have to wait even longer.. . If you are a total rewards or diamond member however, you get preferred seating.  Unfortunately, i could not find my stupid card, and the only way you can use it is if you have in on hand. . . Food also took a good amount of time to come out... the couple sitting beside us didn't get their food until a good 15-20 minutes after we sat down.  Make sure you're not in a rush when you visit, just in case service is slow! . . With that said, boyfriend and I were really excited about Burgr.  We started off with a Guinness and a Sierra Mist.  The only reason I even mention the Sierra Mist is because it's a Pepsi product, and a good majority of Vegas establishments use only Pepsi products, including Burgr :[  makes me super sad, as i'm all about Coca Cola.  But, moving on.  . . We ordered the Britannia (English Cheddar, Mango Chutney, and Arugula) and the Chanterelle (Chanterelle mushrooms, argular, figgy onion jam).  Both pretty good, but also very alike.  The only huge difference we noted was the mushrooms.  Makes sense.  Both had the Arugula and both were slightly sweet from the chutney and the jam.  The meat was super juicy and cooked medium.  Melted right in your mouth!  Also, I've noticed comments on the size of the burgers.  Honestly, I only managed to eat a little more than half.  The burgers are pretty heavy, which makes you feel fuller faster than you normally would.  Of course the order of truffle fries that we shared probably added onto the fullness.  Best truffle fries ever!  I'm usually not a fan of steak fries, but man, these were crispy and delicious!. . I was really set on ordering a shake, but honestly, glad I didn't.  Had no room left for anything else, and was already feeling kind of sickly full.  All in all, for the 2 burgers, truffle fries, beer and soda our bill came out to about 55 (pre tip).  With tip we spent around 66ish  for 2.  Would definitely visit again!
Two stars is for the service.. . This past memorial day vegas trip, I only needed one thing - no, that wasn't entry into clubs, free drinks, or a buffet... it was BurGR's oreo milkshake :((. . I walked in the sweltering heat from Mandalay Bay to Planet Hollywood. I think it took about an hour as I tredged through the unsettling heat that is Vegas. I contemplated taking a taxi, however I figured the calories should be burnt off anyway.. . Once Planet Hollywood finally came into view, my eyes widened and I was a very excited camper. Enter the hotel, and ask the security guys for directions to the beloved burger establishment. As I came near to the signature flames that encompass the brand, I realized that the one thing that I desperately wanted all year was about to be in my hands.. . I walked past the line, as I only planned to order togo. I asked the hostess, "Hi, I want to place an order for togo?" This was 9:15pm. Her answer? "I'm sorry, we're only doing togo orders at 10:15".. . What the fuck. My heart dropped but I couldn't really ask her why is that so, however as I write this review,maybe I should have brought it up with a manager - as I was a paying customer that risked my health in order to try to attain something four hours away from home. I couldn't exactly wait an hour, as I had to go back and get ready for XS's Night Swim. . . I begrudgingly cried out a, "thank you", and made my way the opposite direction. It's an interesting feeling, turning your back against the thing you love. . . WHAT THE FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!! Super sad panda.
One star for the service, 2 stars for the truffle fries (so good), but the farm burger I got was pretty bad and unsatisfactory. I asked for my burger to be well done, but I got it burned.  The bun looks nice, but it was very dry and flavorless, much like the rest of the burger. Honestly would prefer a big mac or an in n out burger compared to theirs. If you're going to buy burgers at this price in Vegas, I recommend going to Holstein's inside the Cosmopolitan. Much tastier!
had the farm burger .....and oreo shake...........shake is about 4 stars.........but the burger was just okay..........nothin special ...........might be back
Quite possibly, the best burger I have ever eaten. Service is meh.....  But food is really great. Not a big menu; they called it BurGR for a reason. I went twice in 5 days-it's that yummy.
I will never eat here again ! The girls working as hostesses have no clue of customer service . We waited in line for over 35 minutes for a burger . Once we got seated we placed our order and the people next to us who came in 10 minutes after got their food well before us . The young lady who brought us our food told me the burger takes 30 to 40 minutes . The manager came over and asked how everything was and I told him the food was fine and the service was terrible ! He really did not seem to care . I have never written a review before but I felt the service was so bad I had to let people know that if you want to over pay for a burger with terrible customer service this is the place . This was all based on my experience today and they have lost me as a customer for life .
Picture perfect. The food that is, not Gordon Ramsey, who's face is everywhere, a face only a mother could love. The burger was just great looking, unfortunately it was seasoned to death, I've never tasted such a salty patty. The onions really combined for that sweet and savory combo, but I couldn't get over the overly salted patty. The Sweet potato fries were great, the sugar and sauce made a great flavor profile. I won't be coming back, but it was a good burger experience.
Not sure if we hit this place on a bad day but was very excited to go, since I am a big Gordon Ramsay fan. We didn't mind the 40 minute wait in line andordered three of the hotdogs and an American burger.. . The hotdogs were excellent but the burger was way over cooked to well well done and had no flavor.  I had one of these this bad at Islands once, but they took it off our bill.. . When we mentioned it to our server here, he just ignored our comments and charged us the full 115 bucks for lunch.. . Left very disappointed.
LOVE GR! so, since we couldnt afford his steakhouse, we opted for lunch at Burgr..  . The real flames on the sign were pretty cool. Fiiiiiiiiire! then there was a line forming with a sign that said "do not wait here until you check in with the hostess".  so, we left line to do just that.  after waiting to speak to the hostess, she said "oh yeah you just wait in the line".  ok..... Now we lost our place in line! annoying!. the wait wasnt too bad tho (theyre lucky).  we were seated.  all the waiters and waitresses were good looking.  funny, he only wants good looking ppl working for him.  eh, dont blame him but i didnt think the women's uniform was very nice.  they were one piece tight ass short ass dresses.  all the men waiters wore his personal line of jeans with a gold "GR" on the back pockets.. . Our waiter comes.  very friendly.  everyone smiled, ask how your day was going, etc.. then a young man approaches us because he sees my husband's Sabres hat.  He asked if we were from Buffalo.  We said yes, chatted a little, he asked what we were in Vegas for and we told him for our 20th anniversary.  he congratulated us and told us he was one of the managers there. I thought he was just a guest!. then 1 minute later our waiter comes with 2 glasses of champagne! very nice touch GR!. . food did take a bit to come out but it was very good! overall very nice place.  Glad to have had at least something from one of Chef Ramsey's places!
Wait time - We went to eat around 9 pm on a Friday night and it was about a 10 minute wait, although I overheard 45 minutes to 1.5 hours for larger parties.. . Hell's Kitchen Burger - I ordered my mom the Hell's Kitchen Burger which, according to their menu, has "asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and an oven roasted tomato." We ordered the burger medium well and it came out perfectly medium well. That patty is thick, I mean really thick. We're not used to eating such thick burgers. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious and flavorful.. . Truffle Parmesan Fries - I really recommend ordering to share. Even though you might get a little greedy upon first bite, you'll have a food baby if you don't share it. This came with homemade ketchup and truffle aioli. My goodness this was the star of the show. Mom hoarded the aioli, but that's fine with me because she was hurting after ingesting too much fat later (hehheh). The fries came out hot and crispy and well-seasoned. It had a hint of truffle but not too much to overpower the flavor of potatoes and the ketchup went very well with it. The aioli was delicious as well, but I got a little overwhelmed dipping deep fried food into pure fat. The ketchup created a nice balance.. . Soba Noodle Chicken Salad - I ordered the Soba Noodle Chicken Salad which came with two skewers of chicken marinated in sriracha. The noodles are tossed in a cilantro honey peanut dressing. This is by no means a light dish, but I really couldn't stomach a burger. I didn't finish this and had a little bit of the burger and shared this with my mom. This is a cold salad but it was quite satisfying. I forgot how unhungry I was after having my first bite. I loved the texture of the noodles and the dressing was right down my alley. What could be better than food smothered in peanut butter? Well, it wasn't exactly peanut butter, but it was very peanutty. This dish has a sweetness to it and the spicy savory chicken skewers balanced everything out. The vegetables were crunchy and refreshing. My mom surprisingly fell in love with this dish. She's not too fond of ordering Asian-themed foods at non-Asian restaurants, but she finished all of her portion of the noodles and left behind some of the burger! That's a first for her.. . Service - All in all, this was a great burger experience. Service was efficient and fast. Food came out fresh, hot, and flavorful. We really wanted to try his famous shakes that is topped off with pudding, but we were just too full.
Incredibly slow service.  It took 10 minutes for a server to greet us...."drink order? ... what do you want to eat?"  Took my wife 15 minutes for her wine to arrive...the waitress was more interested in flirting with her co-workers....too many good restaurants in Vegas for poor service like this.  We will not be back.
Really liked the jalapeno poppers but the buffalo wings left much to be desired. The burgers were good and I'm very picky when it comes to food and I great indicator of whether I would come back or not is if after the meal I look at my boyfriend and ask him if he would come back and he said yes!
Did I eat at the same restaurant as everyone else? I am SHOCKED by the glowing reviews.. Burger was tasteless, bland, and had no condiments on it- just butter on the bun. Fine, if you're going to do that, at least provide some ketchup when you drop off the burger.. Kale Caesar- ughhhhh... no. Just don't do it. I don't know what kind of dressing was on that salad, but it wasn't like any kind of Caesar dressing I've ever tasted. . Truffle Fries- these were fine. Everyone does truffle fries though, so these were nothing special. The ketchup tastes homemade and a lot like marinara sauce, which was kind of a fun twist.. Milkshakes- these were ok. We had two different ones and while they are nothing to rave about (I saw all of those pints of Haagen Dazs in your reach-in freezer, good to know that I can make these at home) it was just OK. I've had better milkshakes at In N Out Burger or Dick's Drive In.. . I did appreciate that they seated us right away (pregnant lady right here) instead of making us wait in line. And service was super friendly. So there's that.
I would give 3 stars but my hubby would give 5, so 4 it is. . . I got the American burger, I like a classic taste. Came with no ketchup, mustard, mayo as well as no dill pickles. I requested mustard but it never came, and they only had Dijon. The pickles were sweet, which I do not care for. Hubby loved it, the place was neat, had a lot of beers and ciders on tap and the waitress was super nice. I think you can get a much better burger at different locations without spending the money you do here.
Yeah, this chanterelle mushroom med-rare burger is in the top 3 burgers I've eaten in my lifetime.
