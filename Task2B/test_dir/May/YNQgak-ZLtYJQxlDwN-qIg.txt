I've been to The Buffet a few times several years ago and remembered it being a pretty awesome place to eat, especially for breakfast or brunch. Endless mimosas for $15? Yes please. As a result, I wind up pretty tipsy before noon. . . We showed up Monday morning at 8 am for breakfast. There was a pretty extensive line even though it had just opened but this was mainly due to the time it took for the servers to take payment and escort each group in. We weren't waiting long before we were brought to our seats.. . I passed on the endless mimosas this time around since I'd actually had a bit of a delicate morning (boooo) but I made up for it with amazing food. There's standard breakfast fare, including freshly made omelets and pancakes, fresh fruit, cereal, and a bunch of other things I can barely remember. Then there's a whole other level of food: pizza, Asian, Mexican, a fresh slab of meat. I can't even remember what else was there. Then there's desserts: an ice cream bar, assorted bars and cake slices, cookies. . . I ate so much, but fortunately didn't make myself sick (unlike the last buffet I attended!)  Servers were quick to clear off our dirty dishes, although on one clearing they swiped the silverware. . . Since you pay before you get in, once you're done with your food, you can just up and leave. It's actually a pretty sweet arrangement. . . I've never regretted going to The Buffet for breakfast/brunch. It's decently priced, lots of options, and super easy to get to if you're staying at the Wynn (it's right off the casino). Get there early though, i does fill up pretty quick!
Honestly, really disappointed. Very pretty set up and service (two stars for that) but most of the food was unfortunately pretty mediocre. We came for lunch. Asian station was the best but hardly liked anything else and the desserts were not good at all. Bacchanal Buffett is 10 times better and set the bar so high that now everything else feels like a waste of money :(
Go! Don'twait! Sunday brunch well worth the price! $32.99/person on weekends and $19.99 M-F.  Service was typical buffet style but very friendly greeters. . . Love the lox and bagels section in the morning. Desserts were great selection plus gelato and candy apples! I thought the buffet was good and then it turned amazing!
This was by far the best buffet that I've ever been to. Prior to this experience, I was never a fan of the buffet restaurant. This place changed that. Endless mimosa's are $18 and the food is delicious! They offer American, Italian, Shellfish, Asian and the best pastry and dessert selection I've ever seen at this type of establishment. As a self proclaimed foodie, I want you to know that you won't be disappointed.
I may have expected too much but I was not impressed with the buffet at the Wynn. Since Wynn was one hotel I was excited to stay at, I set the bar high for the food as well. The offerings were good in terns if selection, but I definitely do not recommend any of their Asian selection. Not fresh, not well prepared.
If you are dude thinking about going to eat here you better be "proper dressed" because wearing a tank top means that you are improperly dress and they will make you leave no matter how long you waited in line. Or you can buy a stupid Tshirt from them just to go in. There is this tiny sign in the front that stated the dress code, it is so unnoticeable. That code is just a way for them to try to get more money from people.
Pretty solid overall, not many things to complain about.  The wait time for Sunday brunch was about 30 minutes, but very predictable - the attendant told us going in and there weren't any surprises.  Once you are in it's efficient - you are only limited by the time it takes to fill your plate and eat.  Even the made to order omelet and pancake station moves swiftly.. . All the food was great.  Salad selection a little light, but that probably isn't a big draw for most.  Highly recommend the desserts.  Almost all the food was a solid 4, but I would give the dessert station a 5.. . Overall it's a 4.  Good food, OK value, excellent desserts.
Like others have said, I think I just came in with my expectations too high. We came in for the Mothers Day brunch, which was like $8 more than a regular Sunday brunch. You'd think you'd get at least a mimosa with that, but no such luck. We asked the waitress what was different and she said they just put out a few extra dishes. Which seemed odd, since I pretty much just saw the standard Vegas buffet staples out there. . . The food was good, not great. The decor was beautiful. The hostesses' ability to seat us as a group was terrible. . . The Wynn prides itself as a premium resort, and in all other ways it lives up to that expectation. Just not at the buffet.
Changing to 4 star. It was not as great as I felt last time. Good place, quality selection but not from out of this world.
By far the best buffet I have ever been to!. . I'm not kidding or sugar-coating.  It was so good.  I recommend their meatloaf.  The sauce on it was amazing.  The whole buffet really is amazing.  I also recommend the ceviche and the desserts are to die for.. . There is generally a bit of a line, like most buffets, but it moves fast.  Its a little expensive, I think like 40 bucks a person, but for what you get it is well worth it.  I make a point to take my family here every time they are in town.. . The decor is beautiful, as is all the decor in the Wynn.
This place was great.  Pretty easy to find as it is right off the casino.  The decor was good, beautiful in fact! I noticed a sign saying all men had to have shirts and shoes and women needed sheer cover up at the least.  Trying to keep this place a little more Vegas classy, a little less Vegas trashy. . . The staff was so friendly and all of them had a smile on their face.  While there is a lot of choices, it is relatively easy to find where you want to be because they have sections generally labeled.  My main meal was for breakfast (it's cheaper, so I went for a late breakfast just make sure I wouldn't even think about needing lunch that day--$23) . . I had several breakfast items (including a lobster and arugula frittata), but I also had the vegetable spring rolls.  Most of my food was top notch, with very few exceptions.  They had several action stations such as make your own pancakes, choosing your toppings, omelette station, etc.  . . The deserts were overwhelming and delicious.  I had one small scoop of two different types of gelato (dark chocolate one was my favorite, so rich and creamy)!! . . While everything was outstanding, I was slightly disappointed in something.  The pictures showed sushi and French macaroons which I was excited about.  Neither were on the spread that day when I was there. :( . . Probably won't be back to Vegas, but I may recommend this place to my friends that will.
My most recent trip to Vegas somehow ended up being buffet galore and this buffet still takes the gold in my opinion. I had been here once and remembered the experience fondly but when I saw Cesar's and Cosmo were higher rated, we tried them and this is still, by far my favorite! If you can sit in the middle, under the atrium window, it definitely adds to the experience. Exactly the kind of food that I wanted to eat. The Wicked Spoon as Cosmo on a Monday at 11am was very mismatched with not too much I actually wanted to eat. The Bacchanal at Cesars for Sunday brunch was good but I hated their dining area. It was too dark and bland and reminded me too much of a buffet feel. While they did have the most seafood selection, that didn't appeal to me in the least since I don't eat fish.  . . Don't be fooled by the reviews...if you are looking for an atmosphere and great food, this place is still the BEST in Vegas.
$28 (including tax) for the lunch buffet.. I didn't try a single thing I didn't like. Everything was delicious, hot and fresh. Cranberry four cheese ravioli and the chorizo & potatoes really stood out. Even the sushi was good, which was surprising considering that it's a buffet. They cover pretty much every major cuisine. Chinese, Japanese, American, Italian. There's a salad bar too but let's get real here...... Lots of fun dessert choices like gelato. Holy hell. A buffet with gelato. . Waiters filled our glasses up frequently and the staff was courteous overall. . The hall itself was clean, updated and quite decadent. It's inside the Wynn hotel. Go through the casino and you'll find it. . I think it was worth the price. We stayed for about two hours and no one even remotely pressured us to leave or hurry up.. The bathroom was huge and clean and the perfect spot to unload round 1, 2 & 3 in order to make room for the next rounds.
I knew this place was going to be great as soon as I saw the entrance. The decor was beautiful and the layout of food was a wide variety and looked scrumptious.. . I started at the right end of the buffet where the soups and salads were.  Everything is in small portions so you can try pretty much everything.  I had the clam chowder with a mozzarella and tomato salad. Then it goes to meats and cheeses with different types of dips, my favorite being whole grain mustard.  . . It moves onto seafood,  pasta bar,  Mexican bar, huge hunks of meat (I don't mean the men who were in front of me)  Chinese food,  Japanese and cold seafood.  . . I love sweets and their dessert bar was my nirvana. All you can eat gelato,  cookies,  little cakes,  marshmallow pops,  and so much  more!  I absolutely loved this place. But, it depends on your perspective..  . I had a vegetarian friend that went along with me. Although I found it amazing she said there wasn't enough spice for her, meaning she likes hot sauce on everything. Be open to your taste buds being overwhelmed by the tantalizing flavors the chef prepares and you will not be disappointed!
i kept hearing about how great this buffet was from friends, family and online reviews!  so we finally went and got to indulge.  we went at 5:30 pm and it was about a 10 minute wait.  for 2 adults and 1 child it was $105.  fyi, there is a dress code.. . the buffet has seafood, pasta, asian, american, bbq, italian, salad bar cuisines.  every piece of food i tried was amazing.  2 dishes stick out in my mind!  the prime rib and desserts!  i forced myself to enjoy each of the cuisines but i made sure i made multiple trips for the prime rib and desserts!!!. . the decor is very nice.  we sat at a banquette and the leather bench felt like alligator.  kinda cool.  the buffet is very clean and our waiter antonio was amazing.  he bent over backwards to accommodate our two young boys.. . it was a great experience i still need to try a couple more high-end buffets before i pick a favorite.   dang, now i want more prime rib!
The search for vegetarian/vegan eats continued and my party found ourselves at The Wynn again! (seriously am just gonna save up and stay here next time). A buffet is the perfect option for a meal after a long night out. After comparing the breakfast and lunch prices on a weekday with other buffets (*cough* Bacchannal *cough*), I found The Buffet in The Wynn to be more reasonable. As much as I am a foodie, I didn't want to break the bank while enjoying myself in Vegas. . . I admit I felt a little overwhelmed as we wandered around looking around at the food selection. Imagine the Buzz Lightyear meme saying "Food...food everywhere!" I was definitely wondering where I should start my meal--cheese and crackers? Soup? Asian, New American, Italian, Mexican?!. . For VEGETARIAN/VEGAN eaters, there are plenty of dishes that will accommodate your palates. Most of the dishes are labeled with the full ingredients so you won't be caught off guard by anything. My friends enjoyed the polenta with roasted tomatoes, fire roasted veggies, vegan enchiladas, and beet salad. . . My favorite CARNIVORE/OMNIVORE DISH was the fresh ceviche, tossed with a tangy chili sauce on a bed of salad greens. I seriously just took 2 or 3 mini bowls and dumped them into a large bowl (#noshame). The roasted brussels sprouts w/ bacon were super delicious and I didn't expect to like brussels sprouts outside of Thanksgiving. There was also a large selection of roast pork, prime rib, flank steak, and other grilled meats. I also liked the fresh guacamole and smoky hummus with paprika...they paired well with the blue corn tortilla chips and pita chips.. . For DESSERT, I enjoyed the mango sorbet and rum soaked pineapples. The vegan passion fruit tapioca was also a delicious option. . . Things to skip:. - Yogurt parfaits were out too long and the granola was a bit soggy. - Sushi and hand rolls were only so-so (definitely go for the ceviche instead). . Upon entering the buffet (and pretty much the hotel overall), I felt like we were transported to a scene from Alice in Wonderland. The walls were a lovely mint green and there were many flowers and other greenery around. I think the best word to describe the ATMOSPHERE is "whimsy." I half expected the Mad Hatter to pop up as we were enjoying our meal! There are also various elaborately decorated cakes in displays around the room (I would love to order one for my wedding if I ever get married!).. . The SERVICE was a little bit slower due to the lunch rush of a Friday afternoon, but we eventually flagged down our waitress to load up on coffee (seriously needed caffeine ASAP), OJ, and water. I was surprised by the quality of freshly squeezed OJ and strong coffee! Soy milk is also an option as a sub for creamer.. . This is a very diverse buffet that isn't too expensive in the Vegas area. The venue is great and I would highly recommend trying to make the latter end of breakfast time so you can enjoy both breakfast and lunch foods! (be sure to factor in cab and waiting in line times). Mmm...
The breakfast buffet / memorial brunch was all about quantity rather than quality, it was all very average buffet flavors and I didn't enjoy a single thing I tried. The omelet wasn't good, pancakes were average and everything that was precooked (except for the pastries) wasn't good at all (pizza, pasta etc). If you have any taste buds save your money as it was way to expensive for what is it, an average buffet. To make matters worse, the service was also below average with the waitress only coming to our table twice and the cutlery and cups smelt gross like eggs.. I had a better meal the day before at a diner where the entire bill was cheaper than 1 person at the buffet.
Love the buffet @ wynn!!!
Went here during Memorial Day weekend but just got around to posting.  We paid the $16 per person to go in the VIP line.  It was worth it - you get a glass of wine or champagne for it which we would have ordered anyway when we sat down.  . . Although this buffet doesn't have a massive selection like the other hotels, the quality of the food was much better.  Everything was much fresher and didn't taste like the food was cooked hours in advance.  The desserts were also exceptionally great, such as the strawberry shortcake and creme brulee.
As a local, I have tried many buffets.. . It was okay. Buffet is small and limited selection vs other grander buffets in the city.  I didn't feel it was worth the price.  While Wynn is exceptionally beautiful, I was surprised to see the limited selection and size at Wynn. Will need to expand to attract more people.
I came here with my family and we were all very disappointed. The service wasn't spectacular and for my money I'd rather take my business to the Aria buffet. Most of the food was too salty for my taste the soda came from a pitcher and didn't really taste right, it wasn't crisp. The desserts weren't very impressive. Overall I'd say skip this one.
I don't usually do buffets. But, I had heard good things about The Buffet at the Wynn, so decided to give it a try. Almost everything I ate was delicious. The desserts were my favorite. I ended up going back for 5 plates of different desserts. I have also never been so full in my entire life.
Pretty solid buffet, I personally rank it number 2, behind wicked spoon in Cosmo.. . Solid dessert selection, good grub, google service, and he'll it's the Wynn so it's pretty fancy too.. . Crab legs all day everyday, prime rib, etc, but where they really win...the crepe station. Save room for dessert, or just start with dessert and you'll be set.. . Grab a candy apple to go and eat it for breakfast when you're hungover from rolling hard 8's all night at the tables.
4.25 Stars. . This was my favorite buffet this time around.  The crab legs, roasted cauliflower, pretzel bar and creme brule dessert, and spicy tuna hand roll were all very good.  The New England clam chowder was also tasty.  . . The .75 star off is because, besides the hand roll, the sushi selection was terrible.  The worst of all the other buffets.  What a let down.. . The service was terrific and the restaurant is beautiful.  The place looked and felt elegant.  I liked the separate room for desserts.  I would visit here again, but most likely for lunch.
I have to start off by saying that the Wynn is gorgeous! The entrance to the hotel and the indoor garden is beautiful! I truly wished the food was as beautiful as the decor. The buffet had high expectations through the past reviews that we read before choosing to go the the Wynn Buffet- we should had gone to Wicked Spoon.. . The service was okay- we has stacks of plates sitting at the table for at least 15 minutes before one of the waitstaff came to pick up the food.. . The red snapper was left out for too long, had a fishy smell, and was hard on one end for being under the heat for so long. . . The egg whites were watery and had the texture of cottage cheese.. The smoked salmon was out for far to long  as well and also had a really bad fishy smell. . . The only saving grace for this buffet was the dessert station- filled with delicious mini pastries and delicious pretzel bars!!! . . My suggestion is to avoid Wynn Buffett  and head to Cosmo's Wicked spoon due to the quality, service, and overall presentation- not to mention it's cheaper than the Wynn buffet
