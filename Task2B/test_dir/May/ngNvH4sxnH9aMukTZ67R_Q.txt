The splurge of every Vegas trip. I enjoy coming here just for the randomness of food. I always try to go about 30 mins before dinner starts so I can pay for lunch and still enjoy dinner without paying the dinner price. Honestly, the food isn't the best you can find but it's good and if you don't like it, you just keep on movin. And there's ALOT of moving you can do since it's so big. My kids were like kids in a candy store with all of the pies, cakes, cookies, sorbets, gelatos, etc. and my husband most def feasted in the prime rib and crab legs (both are dinner only).
Growing up in Las Vegas this was my favorite buffet and I haven't found one ever as impressive as this one.  I haven't been in years and it sounds like a lot of people are complaining about the quality going down but for nostalgic reasons I am giving it all the stars!
Wasn't impressed. I heard good things about this buffet and I was disappointed. Gelato was the best thing. Steak, chicken, and pork were all dry. The pizza was soggy and the bacon tasted gross. Expensive for mediocre.
I've always heard this was one of the best buffets to experience in Vegas annnnd well I am going to disagree. They have a huge variety of foods, but the quality is a good as microwaveable food. The crabs legs have almost nothing on the inside and the shrimp is gross. My boyfriend had lasagna and got food poisoning. I will never go here again.
the best part about going to vegas for a trip is this de carnival world buffet  .i been to all the buffets in vegas non come close to this 1 .overall 5 stars for me and my family.
I went here when I was in Vegas for vacation back in March of 2014. Carnival World Buffet was our first stop for food when we got settled into our hotel ( located in The Rio Hotel). . . We were seated right away and serviced immediately and our meal was free because my boyfriend had $400 worth of points to spend on food in Vegas from a credit card he uses. Our server was awesome. All he did was clean off our old plates and refilled drinks but he was just super friendly. We tried to tip him but he wouldn't accept the money. . . They offered a large variety of food. brisket, BBQ chicken, ribs, pho which was my favorite, a carving station that included turkey, glazed ham, pot roast and so on. They also had various Italian dishes, seafood, more traditional american food such as burgers, corn dogs, soups, salads mash potatoes, vegetables dishes, etc. It was hard not to find something you didn't want or like. Because we went at a time that was slow, some of the food went quite some times sitting in the same tray. Makes the food look very unappetizing. . . Other than that, the buffet was great. I do think Bacchanal Buffet is better but this one is a close 2nd in terms of best buffets I've gone to. . . I will be back in the future simply because I really enjoyed the Pho and the great service.
not impressed at all!! the food looked like it was sitting out for a while and for the price we paid, it was not worth it $54 for 2 people. the sushi was crap, the mashed potatoes were crap and pretty much everything but the crab legs and shrimp.if i would've known i would have eaten at an all you can est seafood restaurant. if there was an option to rate it a zero then this would be zero.
The seafood here is NOT fresh, not really worth the price. Some sauce can be weird tasting to some customers. My suggestion is to have seafood before you go to Vegas.
I nearly got lock jaw from trying to chew the calamari. The mac and cheese was pretty tasteless. Most of the food left much to be desired, however the chicken wings were great. Not sure they were worth the cost of the buffet though. Better to stick with Hash House if you want to indulge.
Mehh. I guess this buffet used to be the issssh, keyword, used to be. Crab legs didn't taste fresh nor were they meaty. Unique part of this buffet was the Asian soup section, pick a broth and add whatever you like. . . Not worth the line or time.
This week was the first time I had ever been this buffet. I have been dying to go for years because a lot of people have told me it's good. Don't let my 3 star rating fool you though. There are more pros than cons.. . Pros:. -This buffet has a huge variety of food. It is comparable to the size of the Bacchanal Buffet, which is my favorite buffet in Vegas. . -The asian food is excellent! If that is what you like, then I highly recommend this place. My husband and father-in-law have also commented that this buffet has the best duck they have ever tasted. They both work in the food industry, so that speaks volumes to me and I know I have to try it if we ever make it back here.. -The gelato is also very delicious. There's lots of flavors to choose from and they're all good. . -Service was awesome. Our server was quick to refill our water. She also offered us extra napkins and even gave my hubby empty plates for his crab shells. That was unexpected, but very kind.. -It was relatively empty upon our arrival. We came at opening time for dinner (3pm) and there was no line whatsoever. We actually thought they were closed. Haha. . -We got a discount for being local. Sweet.. . Cons:. -The price was still a lot, but I guess it's to be expected because they serve seafood everyday.. -The main reason I knocked a whole 2 stars off of my rating was the quality of some of the food. For example, the mac and cheese had no flavor and it was slimy and just plain out gross. Also, they have the weirdest cheesecake I've ever tried. The base is made out of sponge cake which gives it a weird texture and the cheesecake is also flavorless. I could go on, but I think you get the idea. Just a lot of the food was lacking flavor. :/. . Overall, this place was great, but I don't know if I would make the long trip over here. There are better buffets out there.
