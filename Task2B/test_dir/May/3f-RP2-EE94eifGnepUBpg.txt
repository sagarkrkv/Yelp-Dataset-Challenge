Cirque d Soleil does no wrong in my book. Every show I have seen has totally blown me away. LOVE was AMAZING. I love the Beatles and combined with Cirque was 100% pure amazing in my book. . . I really enjoyed how they captured each Beatles song with dancing, lights and acrobatics. We sat in the 300's and had a great view on everything. The best part of all of the Cirque shows is that no matter where you sit you are insured a great view. The set design and sound is amazing. We got a steal of a deal on Travelzoo.com. Tickets were sort of pricey before the discount, but I would have paid for them even if I wouldn't have had the discounted tickets. . . I don't want to give away any spoilers but just be prepared to amaze all of your senses. I agree that even if you aren't a huge Beatles fan you would still enjoy this show.
Have seen Mystere...Absinthe and a couple other smaller shows.   I love this show.  For me and my friends it was by far the best.
This was my third Cirque show in Vegas, as well as Le Reve. I saw Ka and Mystere before this.. . I enjoyed Love, but felt it was missing the Cirque aspects that I really enjoy. Comparatively, this had much less of the stunts and acrobatics that make Ka, Mystere and Le Reve so amazing. It was more focused on the music and feel of that era, which was very entertaining in it's own right.. . For Beatles fans, this is a must see. For Cirque fans going to see shows of athleticism, I would recommend a different show.
I loved it ! My favorite show here in Vegas, it was amazing and in my opinion best seats are further away from the stage .
My 2nd Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas and I thought the show was pretty innovative. The visual effect was ABSOLUTELY stunning (probably one of the best I've seen in a show). . . I got the ticket online and paid $60.5 for section 201 row R through special online discount. However, there is a certain part of the show where section 100 will be involved (but not really at the same time because you are technically not doing anything). I would recommend section 200 ... it's a better view from above (and not to mention the ticket is cheaper). . . Performance: It felt more like a musical than an actual circus acts (80% solo / group dancing performances and 20% circus acts). Basically the show started with WWII scene and eventually moved on to 2 hours of non-stop Beatles' music.. . The best acrobatics act? Probably the roller skating part where all four skaters synchronized their movements. Most of acrobatics acts weren't as intense as other Cirque du Soleil shows. . . The downside? I do not know ALL of Beatles' songs, so I almost fell asleep on some of slow tempo songs.. . A must visit show for Beatles fans. If you are not a musical person and prefer more crazy and "OMG" acrobatics acts, then it might be a good idea to watch a different show.
I was really disappointed in this Cirque show.  I loved Mystere and "O" but this was nothing like those shows.  I struggled to stay awake for an hour before I couldn't take it anymore and left.  The show was more like a boring dance musical with old circus type clothes and everything was so random and didn't make sense.  The worse part was all the break dancing.  Yes, break dancing to the Beatles.  Seriously... Not worth the price, even if it was free.  Go see Mystere instead.
dont get me wrong, i'm a beatles fan, i just didn't quite know all the songs they played, i enjoyed them all nonetheless. . my fav act is probably when the telephone booth came out and they all trampolined back and forth and across using the telephone booth. . also, the bald guy in grey, aka dr. evil coined by my friend Luke L, stole the show everytime he came out, i'd only zero in on him and no one else. . he's just so dazzling and captivating....
I have to start this review off with the preface.. if you didn't absolutely adore every second of LOVE.. you need to put your inner child on a the back of a milk carton.. because it's lost.. and for that, I am truly sad for you. . . (The comments you see in negative reviews talking about needing to be on acid or have lost your mind to enjoy this show are just about the most inane things I have read on Yelp.). . My girlfriend and I booked our flights as we did just to make sure we would be in Vegas in time to pick up our tickets the day of.. and I was prepared to risk jail time to call the box office from the airplane if we were going to be late for some reason.. . To start, the theatre is beautiful situated in the Mirage. We spent a lot of time in and around the gift shop and in the bar close to it. There is plenty of LOVE related swag. We even grabbed a few small things. There is a few solid places to snap a photo, and the staff is really good to allow people to do that as the show is going on and in the chaos between shows.. . It's a little bit of a cattle herding start, but we just sort of ended up at the front of the bus and got let in first, to be able to get to the concession stand (things are little pricy) but the bartender was good enough to fill up our keeper glasses we had with water for a tip.. . Then you wait with great anticipation for the next gate opening, as they usher you into the theatre. It's dark and a little hard to navigate but there are plenty of staff there to assist you.. . We were situated in the middle of section B. I got a ticket for free because of MLife's app called MyVegas which saved us over $100 bucks in the end. (And I got this on the last day I would have a chance before we actually left for Vegas). . Section B is where it's at.. Sure there is not a bad seat in the house as this theatre was built for the show itself... but you are just high enough that you don't miss anything over your head or behind you.. and you are close enough to really catch all the subtles. . . The girlfriend and I have tried a few times to decide what our favorite scene was.. and it changes by the hour it seems. The Lucy in the Sky scene was just so memorable.. but in the Octopus' Garden is right up there too.. . There is not really a story persay. A few characters along the way you can follow, Sargent Peppers, and the four boys are a constant. But honestly, if you want a movie, go see one in a theatre... this show is just some of the best music you will ever hear in a show, and pure "eye porn" for your senses.. . I did not see one person coming out unhappy with their experience. . . It's more than worth it's price in memories.
"What would you do if I sang out of tune?. Would you stand up and walk out on me?. Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,. And I'll try not to sing out of key."-"With A Little Help From My Friends", Beatles. . Beatles LOVE, with seating in the round, so not a bad seat in the house.  It's been showcased on the Strip for a long time now, and still draws the crowds nightly.. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?select=z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg#z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg. . We used Tix4Tonight to score some primo seats for cheap.  There's a part of the act where a surpise is brought out to the audience and we happened to be the very last row to participate.  I won't spoil it, but it was fun!. . Pre-show, some clowns put on some comic relief by, literally, blowing smoke up people's arses.  Kinda creepy, kinda funny - it was great seeing people's reactions.. . The highlights of Beatles LOVE, for me, were the aerialist during "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" & the act featuring "Strawberry Fields Forever".  Very touching.  I didn't care much for the halfpipes and rollerbladers.  Oh, and the music is on blast!  I'm talking loud!  So, just be mindful of that, if you have sensitive hearing.. . Overall, a great show worth the money & time while in Vegas!  I highly recommend using Tix4Tonight for purchasing tickets the day before/day of.  Our seats were great & we saved a lot of money.  I'm generally not a Cirque du Soleil fan, but I highly enjoyed this eclectic & colorful show.
This is the first Cirque du Soleil show that I've ever seen so take this with a grain of salt. Overall I loved Love! The music is fantastic, the acrobatics was amazing, the choreography is tight and flawless, sound was incredible, and the visual effects were gorgeous. There is no bad seat as the stage is round so don't over-think about where you are going to sit.. . If you like/love the Beatles and Cirque du Soleil, you should see this show. I enjoyed this show so much that I'd love to watch the other Cirque shows. I finally get why people love Cirque so much.
Loved the music, the tricks, the colors, the whole experience.. Seen all the Cirque du Soleil shows in Las Vegas and this is definitely my favorite of the "musical" productions of Cirque (maybe even of all the Cirque shows, but I'm biased to The Beatles music) - the others being Michael Jackson's ONE and Elvis (no longer showing). With The Beatles' hits and Cirque du Soleil's acrobatics and theatricality.... this show easily won my heart over.
I've seen probably a dozen of Cirque shows - most in Vegas, a few traveling, but this one has a special spot for me as I do love The Beatles and their music sounds as fresh as it probably was for audiences when they started out over 50 years ago - I have seen it 3 times now and I would say I'd go back and see it another 3 times, it is that good.  High energy, visually spectacular, with a soundtrack of songs that are mashed together so well, you would have thought they were originally written that way.  Kudos to all the performers who give it their all each and every time we have seen this show.  We elected for front row seats this trip so we could see what was going on under the big sheet the kids on the bed are riding on during one number - well nothing going on under the sheets, so if you think you are missing something under there, you arenot - but what you do get in a close up of this show is the expressions on the faces, the sheer majesty of the dancers and the choreography that make this such a wonderful evening of entertainment.  The absolute best of everything that is Cirque du Soleil and The Beatles.  i dare you not to come away pleased.
