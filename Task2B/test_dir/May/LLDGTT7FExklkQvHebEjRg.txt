Great food but the atmosphere left something to be desired. We had the loudest most obnoxious man at the table next to us. We had intended on a nice dinner just the two of us and ended up with hearing only his delightful stories about surgeries (in detail) and births and oh so much more... If I was to go back I would order out, but never going back, I lost my appetite and the waiter came once the whole time we were there. Small tables (party of two) apparently aren't worth their time. Not impressed
Best dinner I've had ever! . I had the shrimp, which was delicious. But my coworker had the Chilean sea bass and it was amazing! He highly recommends it!
The staff was professional, accommodating and entertaining,  had aome of the best crab legs I've ever had. Highly recommended. .
Stopped by for lunch. Place was busy, but we were still seated right away. We had the Ahi Tun Tartare (ok, albeit a bit bland) and the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail (4 shrimp - 3 terribly overcooked, the fourth just barely edible). Continue on to the Stone Crab Claws, which were ok, but nothing special at $45 per order, and the Seared Ahi Tuna, which was cooked nicely. Best thing we ate was the grilled asparagus. Had a Chardonnay and a Riesling that were fine.. Service was spotty, appetizer plates and some cutlery were cleared and not replaced. Had to ask for a knife and fork again. Took a while to locate our server and get the bill to show up.. All in all we left severely underwhelmed. $200 lunch for two should at least have the main proteins cooked to an edible state.
This is one of my favorite restaurants. I've never been disappointed in  the service or the food. It's a bit expensive, but worth every penny. I highly recommend the seafood salad. I had a crab stuffed shrimp special that was also spectacular.  Go! You'll love it.
This place is not bad but not that best place I've ever been.  We had stone crab claws and stuffed shrimp for apps, for dinner I had Chilean Sea Bass with pan fried corn. Apps were great and dinner was pretty good too. The bass was not the best piece of sea bass I've ever had but it wasn't the worse either. Now, that corn was crazy bananas good. If you don't get anything else, get the corn.
There are few restaurants in Vegas that put in the work the way they do at Joes. Every time we go we are impressed but our last visit was beyond wonderful. We had the pleasure of being waited on by Linda and she made our evening perfect. We were celebrating our first wedding anniversary and she timed each course brilliantly to allow us time to enjoy our meal and each other! At the end of the meal although we were headed home to eat "wedding cake" she gifted us with a slice of pie. The food is always good at Joe's and the service is top notch!
Seafood salad is super good u gotta try it $19 is worth lobster shrimp an crab u cant go wrong wit dat
Off the hook one of my favorite spots in Vegas.  We don't often go back to the same joint each year but I have entertained at Joe's two years in a row.  The service is amazaing the most professional waiters you have ever seen.  Decidant seafood platter app' is amazing and a must.  The sweet corn and crispy hash browns must be ordered (this was at the direction of our great waiter - he was RIGHT!)  I will keep coming back year after year!
I hate giving this restaurant a poor review, but I feel like it's justified, as my overall expectations were not met. . . I went to Joe's this past weekend to celebrate my girlfriends birthday.  She loves crab, so I thought the perfect restaurant would be Joe's Stone Crab. Neither of us have ever had stone crabs before.  We had a 9PM reservation on Saturday night. After ordering, the waiter came back and informed us that they had run out of stone crabs. At first I thought he was joking, but then I realized he was completely serious.  I was initially shocked and then thoroughly disappointed that the special plans I made were now ruined.  So we canceled the stone crabs we had ordered, and the stone crabs that were in the "Whale" appetizer were substituted with a small piece of Alaskan King Crab (I felt they could have done a lot more than that).  Is a 9PM dinner in Las Vegas on a Saturday night really that late of a dinner - should I have anticipated this shortage? I don't think I should have. Let this be a warning to all that come for the claws - come early or else!. . I understand that the logistics of flying in a perishable product fresh every day. I do get that - I'm a rational/logical person. It doesn't change the fact that I was initially very upset, which just turned into major disappointment on this special occasion.  I mean, it's called "Joe's Stone Crab".  It's in the freaking name!  How can you run out of the very product you're named after? (That's a tongue in cheek, rhetorical question by the way - I've already acknowledged understanding the logistics.). . For what it's worth, the food and service were good. Although my lobster was a bit dry on the edges (especially given the price), the sides and dessert were very good. The other food that I had sampled (NY Strip) was good as well, but if you can't cook a steak properly in Vegas, you may just as well shut your doors.  My friends all enjoyed their food and drink (although since I was footing the bill, they wouldn't have said otherwise so, who knows!). The highlights were the loaded roasted corn (excellent), hashbrowns, and the peanut butter pie (skip the banana cream pie).  They were nice enough to bring my girlfriend a dessert at the end for her birthday (although this was after we had ordered two desserts to share among five of us). I guess it was a nice gesture, but why didn't they offer that before we ordered dessert? We just took it with us, and it wasn't very good the next day.. . The service was friendly and unobtrusive.  The waiter deterred us from getting two different versions of the hashbrowns as they portions are very large, and we were very glad he did. The restaurant added an automatic gratuity of 18% for our table of five, which I'm glad the waiter pointed out to me. I found this a little odd, because I think in the long run, automatic gratuity for small parties doesn't favor the waitstaff. I typically tip about 20% on the pre-tax subtotal because it's easy to calculate, so I wasn't taken back by it either.. . I feel like I could have had the same steak and lobster type dinner at one of two dozen restaurants in Vegas, without the long walk through the Caesar's mall (ten-fifteen minute walk from taxi to restaurant) and the bitter disappointment at the beginning of the meal.  Would I have gone to this restaurant knowing they didn't have Stone Crabs? Certainly not.  Will I attempt to dine there again in the future?  Probably not at that location. I will wait until I make it to Miami so I can have reasonable assurance they will not run out of stone crabs.
As far as steakhouses go, I wasn't impressed.  The steak was good but not inline with the price.  I enjoyed the bisque but the grilled asparagus lacked that steak house quality I've come to expect from other steak houses.  I arrived early for my reservation and the bartender was helpful while I waited.  Their list of scotch is decent, at best.
Most incredible meal I've ever had, and I used to live in New York City, people. My server was so friendly, and even suggested that we share the bone in filet cooked to medium rare with the king alaskan crab (she said it was better than the stone crab.) And i Have to agree. Absolutely superb. My meal was two weeks ago and I'm STILL thinking about it.. . Please open a restaurant in LA!
Very glad we found this restaurant. Our plan was to arrive to our hotel and then walk over to the Cheese Cake Factory for dinner. The wait for the CCF was 2 hours and we were starving. We passed this restaurant in the mall and figured we would give it a try. What a wonderful surprise. I thought we might be under dressed to eat here, but they let us in. . Typically when you go to a restaurant you get steak sauce, this place gave you mixed salts. OMG, it was wonderful. It was a great meal. Will definitely return if we ever go back to Vegas.
I LOVE Joe's. I was here last year on a business dinner and came back around for a repeat with a girlfriend from work. The service and food are both wonderful. Obviously, we came for surf n' turf and we both left stuffed and happy (and, for being on the Las Vegas Strip, the prices are the same as you would find at any higher-end steakhouse - nothing on the menu seemed outrageously inflated).. . Our charming server ("Steven" or "Stephen", he-of-the-Awesome-Bulgarian-Accent) suggested we start off with the Shrimp de Jonghe appetizer (i.e., a fancy name for scampi): six plump shrimps, basting in a super-garlicky sauce. Delicious. Joe's also provides a very ample basket of mixed breads (soft pretzel, dinner roll + a savory bacon-y ciabatta that my friend LOVED). . . We both ordered surf 'n turf: petit filet mignon (I chose the Alaskan King crab and my friend had lobster). We also split an order of the Hashed Brown potato and the grilled asparagus with Romesco sauce. My steak was a little overcooked in the interior and a little ash-y charred on the outside. However, the crab legs were delicious (and already split down the middle for me), so I flaked and dunked those bad boys in the clarified butter.. . The presentation and texture of the Hashed Brown was awesome: a golden brown and crusty mound of fluffy-on-the-inside starchy goodness (but a little lacking in flavor). But the grilled asparagus was absolutely delicious (and I don't really like asparagus that much), and the cherry tomato Romesco sauce was truly the star of the dish (we both loved the delectable tomatoes - sweet, chunky, delicious). The generously-portioned sides could easily be shared between 2-3 people.. . We finished off with two desserts (we were both veritable piggies that night): wedges of lemony cream cheese pie with strawberry sauce (my friend's favorite), and fudge pie (my favorite!). They were both about as good as dessert can get.. . To reiterate, our server was excellent: he looked like a possible secret agent assassin, had a fabulous accent, provided attentive (but not smothering) service with a flourish (he snapped our photo), and we never felt rushed or like a nuisance (and we lingered over dinner for close to three hours, chatting, sipping and and forking around - hehe). Service nailed a 5-star rating as perfect.
Delicious sea food. Ordered shrimp Dr jhong which was awesome. The entree was salmon.. The fish was very good.. But too much butter. They probably use butter instead of oil for everything. . Service was awesome. Ambience is  average but not great
Located inside the Forum Shops inside Caesar's Palace, it is a cute place with outside seating if you want to have a nice meal by the water fountain and secretly people watch. Not to mention, it is conveniently located right next to Vosges Haut Chocolat (I highly recommend their boxes of truffles). . . My dining experience can be best described as mediocre. Great intentions, questionable execution. I really wanted to like this restaurant but my expectations were not met. Two of the things I absolutely love is steak and seafood. When you have a restaurant that is known for both, you'd think this is food heaven. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. . . Bread basket- I usually don't talk about the bread but this one deserves it's own review. It is delicious. The variety is great. The pretzel mini loaf is really cute. . . Filet mignon- sadly, it is unimpressive. It had a slight off flavor to it and too salty. And a pet peeve of mine at steak houses is when I asked for steak to be on the rare side, it comes out dry and well done. . . Alaskan king crab- also quite salty as well and nothing special. Served with lemon and butter. . . Jennie's mashed potatoes- Not too bad but it also wasn't memorable either. . . Lyonnaise potatoes- Pretty good. I enjoyed eating it. . . Key Lime Pie- signature dessert was okay. Not my personal preference. . . Havana Dream Pie- Yum. This one is delicious. Might be a bit too sweet but still good. Served with slices of strawberries. It is soft, creamy, and sweet. . . Banana Cream Pie- This one is my favorite dessert. It is delicious. Not too sweet. Great banana flavor. light and airy. . . The service here is friendly and efficient. A tad bit unrefined and awkward at times. Slapping a spoon on a plate and served our side dishes cafeteria style. An elbow almost knocking someone out. And taking someone's eating utensils while they were still using them. Maybe I'm being overly picky but I'm comparing the service with other $$$ restaurants and it does lack a certain refinement. . . Would I come back again? I might just to give this place one more chance. I really wanted to like it but it was way below expectations.
Most delicious crab legs in the whole wide world !!   I'm a big Mac and cheese lover and the mushroom Mac n cheese is the best I've ever had !!! If there were 6 stars I would have put that !!!!
Deeelicious. Came here for lunch and ordered a bit of everything - two orders of stone crab claws, fried chicken, giant shrimp STUFFED WITH CRAB CAKES, and a seafood salad. The fried chicken was definitely the surprise winner, and service was excellent.
Simply amazing.. . My husband and I recently celebrated our anniversary here and our experience was absolutely phenomenal.  Food was delicious and service was perfection.. . This is what we ordered:. - Crab bisque. I am so glad that I found another place in town that has awesome crab bisque because my favorite is actually a lobster bisque that I had once at Treasures (Yeah...not someplace don't find myself returning to just for bisque =P ) It is super rich and flavors are just right.  I loved dipping some of the bread from the bread basket in it. My husband had a few spoonfuls and loved it.. . - BLT Wedge salad. From what I tasted, it was OK. Definitely had better.  Still love the "bacon salad" at Del Frisco's Double Eagle steakhouse though.. . - Stone crab (medium). You get 7 nice size claws. Definitely enough to share between two people.  The best part was the mustard dipping sauce!. . - Copper river sockeye salmon w/ key lime butter. Ever since I had this kind of salmon in Alaska, I've been hooked.  It has just the rightamount of fat and is not dry.  Mine was cooked to perfection at medium.. . - Dry aged bone in rib eye. Delicious, no complaints here. . . After all of that, there was barely any room for dessert; however, we were presented with a complimentary anniversary dessert.  The brownie and vanilla ice cream was basic, nothing special.  We did ask our server about dessert recommendations for next time.  The key lime pie is a gimme and we were intrigued our servers description of the Havana pie (like tres leches!!).. . Reservations highly recommended! We look forward to coming back =)
