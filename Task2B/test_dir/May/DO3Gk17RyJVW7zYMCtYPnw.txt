I was entertained by business associates at Bobby's while in Vegas on business and that's the only reason I gave it one star instead of zero since I didn't have to pay for it. Our party had drinks, appetizers, entrees and dessert and later that night I took a co worker out for pizza. The food is overpriced and the servings are tiny. I was told the entree I ordered wasn't available and my fall back order, steak tenderloin, was about the size of a silver dollar and served on a plate the size of a manhole cover. The decor was pleasant, the servers were good and the food was tasty but for what we paid for it it wasn't worth the trouble.
Great food and excellent service. I come here almost every time I'm in Las Vegas.. . The food is very consistent and never a disappointment. All dishes are well seasoned. Very good wine and beer selection. . . The coconut cake is the best dessert on the menu in my opinion.. . Be sure to call ahead for a reservation as it does get quite busy most evenings.
First, we would have given 5 stars but the host told us he could sit us immediately if we left our table within an hour. BTW, we had RSPV'd and showed up 5 minutes early.. . The food is very good! The scallops with the grits were delicious! The BF had the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops and the plantain tamale was AMAZING!!
Great dinner.  Easily one of the best in my life.  Great service, excellent food.  Make sure you share.  Get appetizers.  Lobster tacos were to die for!
taste, and presentation was excellent , service was not at same level but it's worth the trip, best chile relleno and quest fundido I've ever had!
There were five of us who came and decide to share. . . Sixteen spice chicken salad. Tiger shrimp tamale. Green chili cheese burger . Tuna nachos. . Our favorite was the tiger shrimp tamale. It has such an amazing flavor! Onthe burger I enjoyed the flavors of the green chili but the rest of the burger was just a burger to me. FYI, the Tuna nachos were literally just tuna and some chips on the side. The sixteen spice chicken salad was pretty good, the chicken was so tender and moist! I don't know why I didn't come here before!
Pork tenderloin was amazing........ and the stuff chili relleno.. The sweet Potatoe soup and any salad is really good!! I love mesa grill. Just make sure you make reservations it's packed all the time. We did end up eating at the bar because we were hungry and didn't want to wait. And the service as the bar was jst as good, I really enjoyed it. Although for the price I would recommend getting a table so you can really relax. Anything you order on this menu is delicious
Amazing food! Great service! A variety of food and drink options. I will go again next time I'm in Vegas! If you want a great meal in a lovely atmosphere, this is the place to go!
I was so very excited to get a chance to eat here.  Weshared the goat cheese fundido with blue corn chips and peppers.  This was recommended by the couple sitting next to us, who had just shared the appetizer.  They were right,  so so SO glad I ordered that.  Entrees ordered at our table was the tenderloin and chicken.  Both were great!  The tenderloin is super spicy, but it hits your palate a little later.  All the food was incredible.  And oh my goodness, the bread!  I know, what's exciting about bread?!  Blue corn muffins...yes please!!!  The others were raisin bread and a jalapeno bread.  Awesome!!  My husband and I were still talking about it the next day!. . Serving staff was friendly and attentive and never let our water glasses go empty.  The only complaint I had was that the person taking the plates away actually took them while we were still eating on them.  My example: we finished off the goat cheese appetizer and still had about 5 or 6 chips left on the plate.  The guy (not our waiter) came over and took our plate while I still had a chip in my hand, clearly it was still eating.  Now, granted I wasn't assertive and didn't say anything.  . . Overall good experience!  I would visit again if I come back to Vegas!!. . (Love Bobby Flay's recipes on Food Network!)
We had a great lunch.  The Blue Corn pancake with BBQ duck was super.  My wife has the hot smoked salmon club and I had the Yucatan chicken skewers.  Both were excellent.
3.5 to be more accurate. We came here the first night of our Vegas trip. We arrived late to our reservation due to incorrect navigation, but the staff was very polite and understanding and still seated us right away. The customer service here is above average. We were soon greeted by our server who was very knowledgable about the menu and recommendations. We ordered the rabbit and a chicken quesadilla. The rabbit was cooked perfectly and the sauce that accompanied it was delicious! They also had a couscous with the rabbit that was so amazing! Even though it was a side, the couscous was my favorite of all the items we had here. The quesadilla was also very tasty, and it was a far more simple dish. Neither dish was over the top amazing, but both were cooked perfectly and had good flavor. The reason for the lack of stars in this review is due to the price. Although both dishes were great, to me, the prices were too high for overall experience.
I decided to give this place a try being that Bobby Flay is one of my favorite celebrity chefs and love his food ideas. I had the sweet potato tamales! So good! Gotta have them! Oh, and the corn muffins that they give you in the bread basket.....TO DIE FOR! Love the service and the food was good. The atmosphere was nice as well.  Round of applause to that.
This place was great. Came here with a group of friends amd we all were very impressed with the waitor's knowledge of everything on the menu down to thier taste. We all ordered the tiger shrimp appetizer to start and it was sooooo good. To drink I had the peach magarita,which was amazing!  For the entree, I ordered the grilled lamb chops, and they literally melted in my mouth. Everthing came in excellent timing. I would gladly come back to mesa grill as they have exceeded my expectations with their food,drinks and service.
Awesome! One of the best meals we've had. Great fresh intense sw flavors. Lobster tacos awesome. Shrimp w tamale awesome. Coffee rubbed filet amazing. Chile relleno very good not over the top but vg. Twice baked pot and roasted corn sides were good not amazing but good. Great service cool atmosphere. Margaritas and mojitos were great too. We be back!
Our lunch was 16 spice chicken salad, green chile cheeseburger, romaine salad and goat cheese queso. Thumbs up on all the dishes. One drawback for vegetarians is that they couldn't separate the chicken from the chicken & black bean quesadilla, because they said it was pre-mixed.  Peaceful interior, not infused with casino music.
Wow!  Loved it. Tuna nachos. Sweet potato soup and Mesa burger made for a wonderful lunch. My wife and I left very happy!!! Thanks Mesa grill.
Make sure to get the lobster tacos as an appetizer and the corn with whatever you get. Ivan was the best waiter's assistant! So attentive, so polite, and went ABOVE and beyond to accommodate my 75 year old mom's request. Thank you, Ivan! Youtotally deserve a raise and paid vacation!!!!
Some friends recommended Mesa Grill and it did not disappoint! I had the filet and it was the best steak I have ever had! It was so tender it was like butter. My wife had chicken and it was also amazing! The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the dessert. I had the the banana cream pie and it was okay, not great. Wife had the coconut cake and she said the same thing about hers. They also had tables really close to each other which didn't feel very private. I felt like the people on each side of us were listening to our conversation.
Food is very good. Everything is clean and the service is spot on. Not typical mexican food.
The service was great, nice relaxed ambiance as well. Had the tuna appetizer and chicken black bean quesadilla they were both great , however the menu selection is really really short so if your looking for a variety of things you won't really find it here. My friend had the smoked salmon sandwich which she didn't really enjoy. My fiance had the burger which he said was really good.
Great spot to get a nice dinner in Vegas. A good mixtureof mexican-american cuisine. I had the coffee-rubbed filet, which was amazing.
