Just received exceptional customer service from the Luxor! I called in to make a late reservation and was promptly put in contact with someone who could help me. I had missed the window with group booking, but after a bit of work was so pleased to hear they found a room for me and a coworker at a very reasonable rate. They could have very easily made the booking difficult and expensive for me, but instead went out of their way to help me out. Thank you Luxor!
The hotel is cool. You're staying in a pyramid and the decor is all pretty authentic looking Egyptian styles. But the service is lacking. The reservation desk changed the room from a two bed suite to a single bed and we had five people staying in the room so we had to have them sleep on the floor. They wouldn't even bring in a roll away bed because they said it was against code. Then they overcharge for evrything including the food and drinks that are cheaper elsewhere in Vegas. While the hotel is nice to look at, there are better hotels to choose from for the same price.
Terrible. Just terrible. It took us over an hour to check in. We had to order a fridge for an extra $25/day. They "didn't get our order" but they certainly got our money. The shower head was broken. There was no coffee maker. A hotel room without a coffee maker??!! Who would've thought? We stayed from Sunday night through Friday morning and their fire alarm went off on Monday night, Tuesday night and Wednesday night between the hours of 12am and 3am.  Bad, bad, bad!
Gutes Hotel auch wennd bessere in Las Vegas gibt.. Hotel liegt direkt am sudlichen anfang des Strips und damit gut gelegen um entlang des Strips die Stadt zu erkunden.. Die Zimmer sind schon gross und die Betten bequem.. . Preisleistung stimmt auch.. . Criss Angel Show wurde ich empfehlen, lauft ebenfalls im Hotel. Der Casino geht so. Da wurde ich eher New New empfehlen.. . Ansonsten ist das Hotel ganz passabel.
This place makes a holiday inn express look like a five star hotel. After waiting half an hour on the check-in line and then figuring out their extremely complicated elevator system, the first "non-smoking" room I checked into had an air conditioner that sounded like a jackhammer while the timid was humid and smelled of a combination of cigarettes and mildew. It took me another half hour to get back to the lobby and get a new room and the second room was not much better in smell and came with some nice stains on the bed sheets and pillows (see the uploaded pictures). I am too scared to search on the bed bug registry website because I have a feeling I don't want to know. This place is so outdated I think the only solution is to bring the pyramid down and start from scratch..
Just stayed there on April 25 and I was not happy at all.  I paid a pretty penny for a room for one night during, what they considered, spring break.  I was offered either a room on the 5th floor or a room on the 4th floor.  When I asked if I could get one higher up to avoid the noise of the casino, I was only offered a room on the 4th floor and told it would be away from the casino noise.  NOT.  We heard the 24/7 blaring music all night.  The room was mediocre -- no coffee maker in the room (which meant in the morning I had to get dressed and hide myself behind sunglasses and hat to venture out to hit the Starbucks in the hotel lobby), there is no make-up mirror, no toilet paper roll holder, and the pillows were thick rocks.  My neck finally feels better today -- 7 days later.  The casino is fine and the restaurants look good, however, we never got into the Mexican restaurant.  We put on our names down for 2 people and waited over 15 minutes as they ignored us even though they had countless 4 tops empty.  We ended up walking away.  If you don't want our business, we'll take it someplace else and that's what we did.  We had a great dinner at the Monte Carlo.  I would never stay at the Luxor again.
Right the Luxor.... . We went to see the Bodies Exhibit at the Luxor. Normally the tickets are $29 for locals, $22 if you find a coupon, $11 if you have a hook-up. For out-of-towners a whopping $35 smackers UUGGHHHH... That's a bit much I think.. . The exhibit itself was pretty fantastic really. I think they have done a great job, and I was impressed. I would not recommend this exhibit for the very young, or anyone that might be offended by a graphic exhibit of the human body and all of it's parts.. . OK the Luxor itself is an interesting property. The light beaming out the top into the sky visible from the moon, is pretty cool for sure. The elevators do not go up and down they go sideways and up (Inclinators) and they have a great Mexican restaurant as well (T&T). I don't think I would care to stay in a tomb, but heck that's just me.
Last minute trip and my gf tried 16 different hotels!?!? All either booked or couldn't accommodate us for the whole trip! WTF. There happened to be a big event that we weren't aware of that weekend. The last place she tried was the Luxor. She first was told that all promo's were blocked then the person spoke with her manager and said we could have 3 nights FREE!! . . Checking in with Ronnie at the front desk was a pleasant experience. She started the process then left to go into an office, came back out and said she could upgrade us to a suite!! . . We enjoyed the suite and our stay. . . Would've liked to try their steakhouse but not enough time on this trip, hopefully next time!
I wish I didn't have to give this hotel a star because I wouldnt! My birthday weekend was completely ruined by this hotel on two different occasions. The first was when my car was damaged while in the care of the luxor! Valet brought my car to me after being Parked in the hotel for two days and there was noticeable damage! After I put in a claim, the hotel told me they could not do anything for me to fix my car! Upon checking out I realized I left my wallet in my room, I immediately went back and it was gone! The last person in my room was the bell hop. After two hours of putting up a fuss about my belongings being taken because I couldn't get home due to the fact that my money and ID were in my wallet, the bell hop finally gave it back. How could you steal from a guest?! This hotel has been BY FAR the worst hotel ive stayed at in Vegas! They didnt even try to compensate me for either incident. I will NEVER stay here again! Aside from the incidents the entire staff were rude and not friendly at all. I would NOT recommend staying at this hotel.
If your looking for a hotel that is not over crowded! Your looking for the right place! . I have been to the Luxor 3 times and going back in a week, and I enjoy the staff members! . Only reason why it is missing a star is because sometimes it takes the room service a little longer than expected to bring fresh towels, it took the house keepers almost 3 hrs to being our towels up... . Also the room that we got was not finished cleaned up and it was a mess. I didn't expect anything like this to happen but there were socks and hair in the drain. . But the other 2 times we were there the stay was awesome!!!:]
They lost my valet keys....and I found them!!. First off the keys never worked and the supervisor was not trying to listen to us. He blamed everything on us!! On the last day they spent an hour looking for our keys in the valet office. I went up to the desk asking WTF is going on, and when they said they could not find it I looked to the right and saw them in another box CLEAR AS DAY!! They will never see another penny out of me!
Worst hotelof the chain. Bad customer service. Tiny suites unless you are staying in the towers. I've been a loyal customer for years and unfortunately recommended it to business partners. I can say I will no longer stay at Luxor in the future. Pay extra and stay at a respectable establishment. Hope this helps.
I booked a room here--day of--for $43 plus tax and $20 resort fee (which is also taxed! Boooo, Vegas!). So the room ended being about $70 for two queen beds. My high rating isn't to say that this is the best, or (certainly) the classiest hotel ever, but for the price, it was a great experience.. . The staff was friendly and accommodating: I had to leave right after check-in so a friend waited for me in his car downstairs as I sorted that out and ran up to my room to get changed. The security guy downstairs gave him no hassle and let him pull into a clearly marked No Parking zone for as long as it took, despite the fact that they were busy. The front desk clerk was great at check-in, as was the clerk at check-out. In fact, every employee I encountered had a great attitude, a sense of humor and did their work with a smile. The front desk also gladly offered me a late checkout when I called down about checkout times.. . I flew out the next evening and the bell desk safely held my luggage at no charge for the several hours I had to kill before leaving for the airport. They want you to stick around and spend money, of course, but it's still very nice. . . The room itself was nothing to write home about, but it was clean, comfortable, well-maintained and quiet (except for the faint, ever present  din of the casino coming from the atrium outside the door) and that's plenty good for me.. . They do somehow manage to pack a seemingly impossible volume of unhip shows into their hotel/casino, which I actually found charming in a strange way, but I'm kind of a messed up dude. . . I mean, where else can you find Criss Angel, Carrot Top, Menopause (The Musical!) and "JABBAWOCKEEZ" all under one roof? Nowhere. Because, well, they're all at the Luxor and...Jesus, why!? . . Don't get me wrong: I like Carrot Top. People bag on the poor guy, but he was great as the secret guest commentary on the "Rules Of Attraction" DVD and his Reno 911 appearance was priceless. I'll bet he puts on a damn good show too and maybe I'll even go see it next time and get a picture with him after.. . I also took a dip in the pool, which was fine, except it seemed to be 3 1/2 feet deep everywhere. I walked over to the pool next to it that appeared to actually be made for adults and there was only one person there sitting on the edge dangling their feet in it. Then I noticed the signs declaring that it was an extra fee to use this pool which I thought was incredibly lame. For that, I'm taking a star off. . . Otherwise, my stay was pretty much everything you could ask for the price. I'd definitely stay again for a similar price.
Ahh Luxor. You and I have had some great times together.. . I have stayed at the Luxor once before in my younger years and I thoroughly enjoyed it and a lot of my long-lasting Vegas memories are here.. . During our most recent trip to Vegas we did visit the Luxor again. Not to stay but explored everything within to make all those memories come rushing back. Took an elevator up to the room floors to see out onto the concourse (a must do for anyone visiting). . We visited, and yes, deposited some money into the casino which is nicely tucked underneath the exciting main floor that the rooms overlook. The waitresses in the Luxor are great to serve drinks while playing. They have plenty of fun games to lose your cash to and did we ever.. . We also came to eat breakfast at "More" the buffet at Luxor with another two for one pass from MyVegas and the MLife app they have created. (That review to follow). . But my girlfriend and I agree, Luxor is and probably always will be one of the most exciting looking buildings in Las Vegas.
Estuve  el 5  asta el 8 de mayo y para mi este hotel es lo mejor la atencion es incomparable  me encanta ano  a ano yo  visito muchos casinos pero para jugar nunca como el luxur yo en lo que tengo llendo alas vegas no cambio al luxur sus restaurantes buenisimos  todo llo no tengo ni la minima queja de este holel y no lo cambio . ____. I stayed at this hotel from the 5th of May to the 8th and to me, this hotel is the best on the strip! The attention and customer service is incomparable. I love it more and more every year we take our yearly trip to Vegas. I visit many casinos on the strip to play but they don't compare to the casino at Luxor.  Every year I go to Vegas I always look forward to staying at Luxor. The restaurants are amazing! I don't have the slightest complaint when it comes to this hotel and I won't change!
this hotel is great
Enjoyed our stay at the Luxor even though it's at the end of the strip. It connects to Mandalay Bay on the second floor and Excalibur on the first floor. You can also take the tram between these hotels. The food court on the second floor is open pretty late. There are two Starbucks inside Luxor. Rooms were nice and spacious. Pool is nice and wasn't too crowded. If you're riding the Deuce bus, the stop is right in front of the hotel. You will have to cross the street to the Deuce bus stop if you're heading to the North end of the strip.
Stayed here for 4 nights, 5-11 thru 0505-14-14. . Booked a suite so we were in one of the towers. the room was very nice, clean, huge, the bathroom was very nice also. Only con about this hotel is it doesn't have in room wifi...but it is one of the older hotels so maybe that's why. . The staff was friendly and helpful, the restaurants are pretty good, it just seems as if the place is lacking compared to some of the newer hotels. Plus it is at one end of the strip so plan on long walks if you want to see things, although you can take the tram or the monorail which are located close by. Plus you can walk to both Manadalay Bay and Excaliber thru attached walkways if you wish. . . Room prices are good, cheaper than most so that helps. I will consider staying here on my next trip. . The pyramid shape is kinda cool, the old gal just seems to be showing her age. need to spend some money cleaning up and upgrading is all....of course then prices will go up.
We stayed three nights here and we had nothing but good experiences. The hotel is nice and clean.  The maids always did a good job keeping our room organized without moving our belongings out of place and nothing was tampered with. We had three complimentary nights so we stayed for free but it is an affordable place.
The AC was enough to cool off the room and it was "operating fine" the handset on the phone didn't work either.  It took 45 mins to check in, and very impersonal.  No fridge in room, staff coming in room multiple times even with do not disturb sign on door handle. 1980's carpet smells horrible. Pool side snack bar didn't open until 1130.  2 star hotel IMO
I stayed here on business. If my job could have given me the selection then it wouldn't be this hotel. . . The first room that I got was on the 2nd floor pyramid deluxe. The TV had static lines going in front of the screen. The room smelled differently. . . I asked for another room. I was assigned the 16th floor. If you don't like roller coasters or wild shaking rides, don't stay on the higher floors of pyramid deluxe. There were 2 couples with me going up. One couple says "is this elevator ok" because you can see the walls shaking and rattling while going up. The other couple states "That is normal". I took the elevator straight down and I went to the checkin area. . . The lady felt sorry for me and gave me a pyramid suite on the 1st floor.  I am giving this a 3 star for the excellent service give to me by the vip checkin staff. However, this is not a typical hotel for me to stay in.
Is this the Ritz Carlton? No. Will your bathroom come with mini pyramid shaped soap? Yes. . . The Luxor is consistently $25-50 cheaper than the places I normally stay at (Mirage or MGM), so I wasn't expecting that quality. But for the price, the value is there. . . With easy access (connected) to Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur, this is an excellent Vegas HUB.
We arrived Wednesday and left Saturday before this Memorial day weekend.  The last time we went we got upgraded to a King pyramid suite for free so I asked about upgrade options this time.  Paid upgrades were the only options this time, so I paid for an upgrade for 1 of my 2 rooms, so my guests could experience the same suite we had 2 years ago.  Our front desk representative made it seem as though the suite we were getting was in a really great location at the very top of the pyramid on the 30th floor. When we opened the door to the room, we were greeted with a pungent smell that was a cross between pickle juice and a solvent (weird, I know!), the Jacuzzi (not a Jacuzzi) tub was peeling on the bottom and the access panel to the tub was broken and hanging open. I cut my finger on the panel trying to close it. The suite was also smaller with half of a living area and not much larger than a regular room.    . I called to complain and they did assign us to a different room that, again, was in a better location and a larger suite.  We were told to wait for someone to come up to bring us new keys.  Two phone calls and about 20 minutes later the bell hop called and asked us to just come down to the desk because the room we were in was "out of the way" from our new room.  So we went down and got our new key, picked up our own bags and went to our new room.  Besides the smell of the food court that was very strong on the hall, the room was better on the 11th floor but we were still disappointed after wasting all that time. . Overall, the rooms are showing their age, but I guess that's what you should expect for the money.  They were clean place to sleep, but if you are going for quality, convenience and a cool pool, pay more and stay somewhere in the middle of the strip.
You get what you pay for... A room in this hotel is pretty cheap compared to other hotels in the strip. But Luxor is a nightmare! . . Room service is lacking, and the hotel housekeeping is just terrible. I'm one of those people who get paranoid whether or not the room has been cleaned properly. It doesn't matter if I'm in Vegas and will spend no more than 5 hours in my room. I still want the bedroom to be clean! . . I understand they have over 1300 rooms, but please clean up well after other guests. Having leftovers from previous guests is disgusting. There was hair in the bathroom from previous guests. Gross! I tried to plug in my phone next to the bed, as I moved the night stand there was trash and candy wrap behind the night stand! Ew! I was just imagining all kinds of bugs crawling on that dirty dark carpet. I was scared to leave my suitcase open on the floor and to walk barefoot in the bedroom. . . It looks nice on the outside but the interior is just a disaster!
Where do I start we were really dreading coming here as there was lots of bad comments, bt I was well impressed rooms were clean and nice hotel spot on nice friendly staff I would defo come back :)
This was our second time staying at the Luxor, both times in the pyramid.  We found the rooms clean and maid service was good.  The rooms are starting look a bit run down, but with how many people come and go through Vegas it's to be expected - we've found the same with most hotels we've stayed at  (this was our 7th trip since 2008).  We love the Luxor, the casino Is small with easy access to the strip and of course Fat Tuesday's!  We also love that they now have THREE Starbucks locations - big bonus for us Coffee loving West Coast Canadians!!  We'll definitely stay again!!
This is my third time at the Luxor.  The public areas, pools, and staff are fine but the rooms are very dated and poorly maintained.  The elevators are sketchy and while the prices are $25-40 lower than others on the strip, there is no Wi-Fi and restaurants are sub par.
We just got back from staying in the Luxor over the Memorial Day weekend.   My first trip to Vegas and my birthday.  We booked a tower suite because we wanted a little extra room (& because the husband snores).  Overall,  a decent hotel, but nothing spectacular.   The bathroom smelled like a sewer,  so we had to keep the door closed if we were in the bedroom.   Also,  there was no jetted tub as decribed in the room description and shown in the pictures. . . I will say also that the pool was useless.   There are three pools,  but only one was open to "regular" guests.   You had to shell out extra$ to use one of the other pools.   That was disappointing consider the amount of people crammed into the small section. . . The power also went out one night so they weren't letting anyone into their rooms on the West Tower. . . The Jabbawakeez show was INCREDIBLE!  A must see and it's on the upper level.  This was the hotels only saving factor. . . If I do go back to Vegas,  I will definitely not stay in the Luxor again,  sorry to say.  I was so excited to go and stay there
Just checked out, I booked the premier luxury suite 3 months in advance.  I liked at the floor plan and size before booking.  When I arrived the check in was very fast.  When I got to the room, it was smaller without the extra bathroom and extra sofa.  I came here with my 2 daughters 10,13.  I front desk and they apologize but there's no other premier suite and will send a roll away up no charge.  Lies!  They never sent up a roll away.  They were supposed to change my room the next day but still nothing.  I talked to a manager and he tells me there's a big premier and small premier suite. I asked him to show it to me on luxor booking site.  No where to be found. ... they finally removed 2 night roll away charge $32 a night.  I'll never come back here
Yeah this place is just a not up to Vegas snuff.. . I really wanted to like it, but when you pay 250 a night to have a view of a concrete wall and then AC units with cig butts yeah.... then you know you get your money worth. . . I think that the luxor really needs to put the money in to redo it and also have a better checkin and check out system ittakes far to long. . . Just not worth it, I think it is overpriced and outdated. With all the other options on the strip they really need to up their game.
It's an ageing hotel on the outskirts of the strip. You're getting the Vegas experience for somewhat cheap.. . You can see the hotel's age in the little ways, cracks, worn off letters, loud pipes, etc.. . Book a tower room if possible, they're three years newer.. . It's a perfectly acceptable/clean place to sleep on the whole.
Not up to snuff. I stayed at Luxor a few times. Used to be one of my favorite hotels in vegas. Not anymore! :(. . Pros: . - Fairly large shower . - comfortable bed. - many dining options. - Starbucks inside hotel - Starbucks!!. . Cons:. - Dirty rooms - even after it has been 'cleaned' (HUGE deal for me - primary reason for bad review) - in fact, my friend's room had dirty towels and used bandaids!!!! on the floor when she checked in  what the ????!!@!!. - older AC not strong enough for desert temps. - Pillows too big, high? - don't know how to describe them, but they made my neck hurt!. - my friend got a 'deluxe' room - umm it was literally a handicap room =/  nothing deluxe about it. - staff selling timeshares were waaaaay too pushy. - Many other hotels a lot more luxurious and updated in the same price range to choose this older hotel. . yeah, i'll pay the little extra to stay in the much more luxurious Mandalay Bay, thank you very much.  =/ :(
Do not come here. A million hidden fees. I had to pay to RECIEVE a package that was sent to me. Ridiculous.
I loved staying at the Luxor!  I stayed for 3 nights.  The Luxor is one of the better budge t hotels on the strip.  The room was spacious and clean.  I know it sounds weird but the Luxor smelled great!  The lobby, the casino the room all had the same smell and I loved it.  This hotel is pretty tame compared to some of the others.  I greatly enjoyed the Chill atmosphere.  You can walk to Mandalay Bay and Excalabor without leaving the building which is nice.  They offer dining options for everyones needs (nice, upscale dining and food court style dining).  The staff could not have been nicer!  Everyone was so very helpful.  They even offered airport check in at the hotel.   I was able to check my bags at the hotel and not see them again until I arrived back in Phoenix.. . It's not the Aria, Wynn or Cosmo but for the price point and give the fact that the Luxor is one of the older hotels on the strip.  .it is A+. . I recommend staying the East Tower.  It's quieter than the pyramid, and a little newer.
