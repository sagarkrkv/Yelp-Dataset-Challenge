This place is my favorite!! The setup is fantastic! If you're a girl be sure to have a promoter get you on the guest list! You will have a separate line, free entrance, as well as 1-2 drink tickets! . -Sunday swim is LOTS of fun! . -You can find places to sit even if you do not have table service. . -Awesome DJ's! . -Indoor, outdoor, upstairs . -Pool! . -Don't require you to buy bottled water! (Rare in Vegas)
I regret nothing when I show up to this place! I've been here sober, drunk, happy, depressed, you name it! I'm very happy when I come here and it is definitely worth it if you're willing to make the most of it. I've been here as a regular ticket holder and VIP. I can't say you can go wrong when it comes to XS.. . First of all, bottle service or not, this is one of the most enjoyable clubs in Vegas; not because of the artists or the price range, but mainly because of the club's design. The club in itself has an indoor and outdoor area. The indoor is medium sized with a rather small dance floor. The exterior is similar except its a much bigger space and you get to see the Dj's back. They have a large area to sit in as well as many areas to lounge in without a table. I'd say this is the place to go to if you don't have a set spot to be at. They have a ton of areas to relax in since its a big venue, so a table isn't really a need. They won't tell you you can't sit like other clubs. TORTURE that I don't want to go through! They also normally have well known DJs spinning here for a cheaper than normal price.. . With a table, they treat you like royalty. You get all the perks of skipping lines with minimal hassle, devine service, and extra attention. The staff is beyond amazing; refill your drinks every chance they get, go above and beyond to make sure you're comfortable and have everything you need to enjoy yourself. . . The production in itself is pretty cool if you ask me. Since there's an indoor and an outdoor, they have large monitors displaying crazy images while the Djs are going off. The sound projects all over the location so wherever you go you're never really  missing the party!. . Overall I truly enjoy the luxuries this place has to offer. Every single time has been enjoyable with the exception of one extremely crowded and ridiculously cold night. During those warm nights, this club makes your experience that much more enjoyable. There are plenty of places to be and sit, you won't have to worry too much about discomfort if a table or even cabana is out of your price range.. . Be smart and get ticket ahead of time! Don't get stuck waiting those ridiculously long lines! Save yourself a headache and party your brains out ;]
I have my good days and bad days at XS. The service here is only geared towards those who have a table. This is my first time at a table at XS, and I've had better bottle service.. Music is always EDM! It's never a switch up or some good old hip hop haha.. The club dance floor isn't too bad. If you can even get to it ha! . I like how they have small stripper poles for the girls to dance on! . . Need to check out their night swim. Then i'll update my review :)
I'm having Vegas withdrawal and writing a late review to ease my post-trip depression!. . Wow! XS has got to be one of the best clubs with gorgeous colors and exquisite decoration! I was super electrified to step in and got a chance to party at one of the best clubs in my entire life just right here at Las Vegas. Very lavish, strikingly beautiful with astounding atmosphere. It's a clubbers' dream to party up here at XS! You've gotta venture up here to complete your Vegas trip. . . My highlights:. - I stayed at the Encore on Halloween weekend, which this club is situated in, which was SUPER CONVENIENT! It was literally only a few minutes walk from our room. . -Beautiful women everywhere from all of the 7 continents around the world. . -Ladies, go dip your feet into the shallow pool to wade on. . -No designated drivers needed if you stay at Encore/Wynn hotel. Go get wasted!. -No lines since we had VIP access due to our bottle service. Great bouncers! They do re-entries. . -The music, EDM, dubstep-y, & hip-hop-ish. It was Kaskade DJ'ing on our Halloween night! I did not know who was our DJ lineup until I came in hella buzz knowing it's actually Kaskade playing.. -Our stunning $1,000+ table on a cabana with comfortable couch with cushions by the celestial waters! Seriously, GET A BOTTLE SERVICE! If you have money to blow for a table, get one. Gentlemen, ladies will come up to you like a magnet if you get a bottle service/table for them to sit next to you. Worth the investment. After all, it's Las Vegas and money ain't a thing! . . Negative aspects: . -Expensive. Just be prepared to have money to blow! I saw a special Dom Perignon 6L bottle for $25,000! Oh my goodness. It's on their menu. We stick with the Hennessy Privilege, LOL.. - I didn't really order a drink from the bar since we had a table. I heard their drink is about nearly $20~ a pop!. -It can get crowded inside. Thank goodness we have a table outside by the pool so we have our own space and room to walk around! . . Do yourself a favor: dress to impress, drink up, dance the night away, and make it one of the most memorable night in Sin city.
XS NIGHT SWIM.. . First time here to XS, and first time doing a "night swim'. The night swim, ppl can show up in swim attire and party in the pool. When i went I went here I was well aware of this. However, when I showed up to the club a lot of people that were unaware that they could have come in there bikinis and swimming trunks. A lot more people were dressed  up, doing the  dress to impress compared to the people who had swimming attire. . . We had a table and bottle service. Best thing about the bottle services, juice and mixes were always constantly fully. We never rain out of coke, oj, and sprite. . Table and couch were nice, and plenty of space for your area. . . PRO. - There are gambling tables available in the xs night swim club: black jack, and craps. Same casino rules apply, play a game and order a drink from the cocktail waitress and you just have to tip a buck. Way better than going to the bar and paying full price for a drink! . . - If you have  table service, and you still have to buy 2 MORE Bottles to reach the minimum requirement. Ask the server  if you can take the bottles with you back to your hotel. I did this, we had two bottles of grey goose on our tab to hit minimum requirement. We were able to take the two Unopened bottles us with us home, and when leaving the club we were escorted by a security guard who had the bottles in hand and gave it to us while were out of the club.. . - Heated pool, plenty of space in the pool. There are areas were girls can just wade in the water.. . CON. - a lot of EDM music, I like to have a mix hiphop and trap in there once in a while.
Great nightclub, had an awesome night! The music was good and I loved the outside pool party!
XS is my definitely favorite club in Vegas. I like it so much and I have to stay at Wynn/Encore for the convenience. . . Reasons why I like it so much. A. They have good music, DJs. I came here to see Avicci,. Hey... Brother.... B. Huge open layout, not stuffy with sweaty guys and people smoking. Fresh air is priceless!. C. Good crowd, I think. D. There are pools with hot chicks. E. Tables for you to drop more money. . There is a special line which is much shorter for the hotel guests, ask the hotel concierge!
Given my original review was way before Las Vegas became the EDM capital of the world, I figured it was appropriate timing to update my review.. . XS is always going to have a special place in my heart since it was the first Vegas club I ever went to (and on back-to-back nights no less!).  And since then, we've had such challengers such as Marquee, Hakkasan, and Light (yeah, let's not pretend Surrender is on the same level) pop up.  . . On a design level though, XS is still the best of all the Vegas clubs.  Easy to get and easy to get on.  Half-indoors if you like the glamour, half-outdoors if you need some air and/or smoke a cigarette.  You won't really have to worry about the threat of getting lost in a maze (see: Marquee) or fall down a flight of stairs (see: Hakkasan).  Yes, this matters when you're trying to get booze.  And XS makes it VERY easy to get booze with the location of its bars.. . The dance floor is by far the biggest of all the clubs I've mentioned in this review.It gets packed as you would expect, but at least there's plenty of room to maneuver in and out as you please.  Only issue is that since XS wasn't originally designed for EDM, the actual stage/lighting/visuals setup can't even come to close to the other three clubs.  But when you can still bring top guys like Avicii, deadmau5, Steve Angello, David Guetta, and Zedd...well, the visuals don't matter as much I guess lol.. . XS is still pretty awesome though.  Even though Marquee is personally my favorite club in Vegas, I know I'll never have a bad time at XS.  And now that XS is the oldest of all the Vegas superclubs, it's not as frequented as much as used to...which works out in my favor because that means I get to walk in free!  It's definitely good to know people. :D
Last time I went was a few years back but I do remember it was a great place. good vibes and good music.  They have indoor and outdoor dance floors as well as bars. There is a pool outside for the day parties but also to be used sometimes at night.  It gets pretty fun to dip in when it's like 100 degrees outside :) . This place is great to go to after you have pregamed, because just as all the other vegas spots, drinks are ridiculously priced. One adios MF that was in a small scotch glass cost me almost $20. No bueno! As a girl I got free entry but no drinks included,  booooo!
Place is huge!  So many tables outside with cabanas as well if you are feeling extra lucky. . . Service was top notch for our table area, and we had a good location in respect to DJ. . . Highly recommend but come ready to pay!
This was my first time going to Vegas Clubs and this was the best of the 3 places I went. . . Let me first say that I totally understand the long lines whether you're with a promoter, table service, or regular ticket. Luckily we had a connection that got us in with NO LINE.. . We walked straight out to the pool area and tried to find a spot close to the DJ booth because David Guetta was performing. We were able to find a place to sit with our feet in the pool right behind the dj booth. When David Guetta got on stage, a few girls jumped into the pool with their dresses on and a few guys did the same. After a while the pool had about 20-30 people inside of it with people splashing hard whenever the music picked up. It looked really fun except there was trash floating in the water after a while (cups, cigarettes, straws, napkins, bottles, etc) . . When people started to get rowdy inside the pool, i just stood next to the pool on the ledge and continued to enjoy the show. It was such an experience and I would love to do it again!. . Such a huge venue with a lot of space for people to party. Definitely the best club we visited on our trip.
This is without a doubt my favorite club to go to in Vegas!!! . . I was told that they started selling tickets for the outside section only? I totally see how that can be a great idea because I like the outside section more than the inside section. . . The inside section is only fun when I go with a large group of guys to protect me from other people bumping into me... cause if I'm just with my girl friends I'm usually the crazy one that will go and push other people back. That's just too much work!! The stage is pretty dope though. I've seen a bunch of people here, including Dead Mau5 2 years ago and David Guetta over Memorial's Day Weekend. . . Nevertheless that outside area is what really does it for me :D you can dance and take pictures by the pool!! There's an outside bar also!! It isn't hot and stuffy, and it definitely isn't as crowded as the inside!! The only setback is when it rains O_O' When it started sprinkling on Saturday night, I was very worried for my hair and make up... Thankfully the sprinkles stopped and my friends and I were able to party it up!! . . Caution: Don't get pushed into the pool!! I actually know some of the girls who got pushed into the pool this past weekend... Drunk people =/ tsk tsk
I had SUCH an amazing time at XS this weekend!!! I bought presale tickets. Yes, even as a girl - I did it for convenience. It was soooo worth the $24ish I paid online! First, because I had access to both the indoor & outdoor sections! Also, I didn't have to wait in a line AT ALL. The venue is BEAUTIFUL and spacious! The staff is friendly & helpful. The people who go there are not rude or grimey. The bartenders are quick to attend to you. The indoor stage was great and you could enjoy the show from anywhere (anywhere inside or anywhere outside). Being inside, right smack dab in the middle of the dance floor was the PERFECT spot though (right under the chandelier)! Great view & made it easy for other people to find you. Definitely coming back to XS!!. . PS. David Guetta was AAAAAMAAZING!! I am having huuuge withdrawals from Saturday night
XS Nightswim is so much fun!  . . +Plenty of places to sit/lay out even if you don't get bottle service. +Floaties galore. +Great crowd and ambiance. +Cheaper than the night club. +Easy to get in (important when you're going with a bunch of guys!)
It was the WINDIEST and COLDEST night in Vegas during Mother's Day weekend this past month. Somehow, us hotties managed to squeeze into our sexy little numbers and strut our stuff into the VIP line and straight into da club.. . Even though it was windy and NO ONE wanted to be outside dancing or being blown straight into the pool, we basically opted to stay outside...sorta! After standing around a bit inside and getting pushed and shoved a little too many times in that mosh pit madhouse we met some really nice guys who had one of the VIP cabanas upstairs which was semi indoors. YAY to that!. . We ended up dancing the night away...or in my case, sitting on a comfy couch, sipping on some Tequila and watching Diplo from our TV screen inside the cabana the remainder of the night.. . This was actually my second time at XS and I have to admit, the DJs they have coming through here are legit and the music is always on point. . . Another BONUS this second visit of mine, I actually met someone who's been following me on my double jaw surgery journey and I was able to put his mind at ease for his own double jaw surgery he's about to have very soon! How awesome that I'm able to even inspire and help others while I'm shakin' dat thang at da clubs! ;). . Recap of that weekend on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFd8kfiZIJY&list=UU5YaBtOxOYqeFEEQ_aW6JiA
You look left... CHISELED six pack abs...you look right...a girl in a SMOKING bikini...you do a 360 and gosh sexy bodies everywhere!. . I came to XS Sunday Night Swim on Memorial Day Weekend and I got to say the Night Club lived up to its reputation. . . XS translates to "Do everything in EXCESS, to BE EXCESSIVE". . Extravagant and beautiful, the venue boasts a patio with a pool that wraps around an island bar. Inside the club there is a DJ stage in an opulent room fit for royalty. . . Atmosphere: A Night Club is soulless without the people that make up the vibe. People are the art piece, the object that makes the room alive. And that night there were over 11,000 beautiful people at the night club...an all-time record attendance for a night club. You can see the link below. . . http://hauteliving.com/2014/05/haute-event-avicii-breaks-xs-nightclubs-attendance-record/491642/. . To illustrate how many people were at the club...You couldn't even see the water in the pool because there were so many bodies dancing in the pool. Even with all those people at the club I did not once feel packed. XS is very spacious and very well designed. . . Drinks: As for the drinks get the Adios Mother Fucker...it is hella strong...and if your baller there is a $10,000 cocktail called the Ono,,,and if you are a high roller you can always get a 30 L Vessel of Armand de Brignac for $100,000. . . So if you are ever in Vegas you must go to XS on Sunday Night! You will not be disappointed...you will experience so many great memories that will leave you with a Vegas high long after you have left the sin city =)
Have to say I was a bit leary about coming here but I tell you it was the BEST BEST club night EVER and I've beento a lot of clubs.....My sis and went this past weekend for the Memorial Holiday and we purchased tix in advance on wanttickets...it was TOTALLY worth the $40 a piece I paid!!!! AND THEN SOME!!! Out of thousands of people we just happened to see a friend of my sisters who had a nice spot on the edge of the pool where we could all dance on the fold down pool chairs...it was SOOO FREAGGIN FUN!!! GIrls were jumping in the pool with club dresses on guys were in there too...it was wicked...not too mention David Guetta was on the DJ turn table....couldn't have asked for a better night.  No matter WHERE you are in this club your bound to have one memorable night...the only thing I didn't care for was the Disneyland line at the beginning of the club before you enter...then once we left (close to 4am) there was a 2 hours taxi cab wait thank the dear lord we had our fold up flip flops in our purse...we walked back to our room in 25min...no biggie as we were right on the strip.
This place is by far one of the best night clubs in Las Vegas. The venue is spacious and huge!  My buddies and I got table service on new years eve, Had the time of our lives! The service what's great. Bartenders are also pretty attentive. Place is pricey so be ready to spend some of that hard earned cash. Gorgeous People everywhere. Strict Dress code so leave the Jordans at home unless its for the "Night Swim" events they often host.
Night swims are officially my new favorite thing to do in Vegas!!! The giant floaties were fun to play on and the outdoor area is huge. Indoor isn't as big as some other clubs but there's cool decor.
