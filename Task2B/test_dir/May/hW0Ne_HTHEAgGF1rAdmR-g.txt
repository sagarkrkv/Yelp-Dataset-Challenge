As far as airports go, this one is clean, easy to navigate and has up-to-date facilities with plenty of things to do if you arrive early and need to kill time. There are decent shops, restaurants, and places where you can sit comfortably. A few charging stations can be found throughout.. . Depending on which side of the airport you are on will determine what you are able to find as far as shops and such. Each terminal has a different variety of things to offer, so it's hard to say that you can enjoy Starbucks while you wait, if you are in a terminal that doesn't offer that option.  . . Security is relatively easy to get through if you listen ahead and see what all the rules are and prep before it's your turn to head through. We went through on one visit and didn't have to remove our shoes, and on another visit we did, so just be sure to listen up for what they are looking for when you go.. . Overall: A. Friendly, clean, places to kill time and a variety of options. Decent airport!
Not nearly as bad as Ohare Airport but not as good as Mesa Gateway.
One security line open. ONE. Line is wrapped around the tape 3 times. Unacceptable and completely ridiculous. . I guess they don't want anyone to leave, which makes sense given it's beautiful here.
Beautiful & Hella Crowded!  But Wait!  Now With FREE WiFi!. . SITREP. . I did NOT want to be here.  I kept wondering, "Where is Mr. Rogers?  This is NOT my neighborhood!!!". . THE SETUP. . I was on a Spokane to Sacramento trip...BY WAY OF FUC'n PHOENIX!  "Way to add 5 hours to a 2 hour flight, SouthWest!"  But it's kinda hard to blame the lovely Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport that turn of events.. . [And in the end, it was even hard to get angry at SouthWest since they DID have the courtesy to take us right smack over the top of the Grand Canyon - a sight I'd never seen before - so THAT in itself was an ironic treat.  "Hey Mom!  Yeah, I know I was going to Sacramento, BUT guess what?  I saw the Grand Canyon too!"  Now THAT doesn't happen every day.]. . AIRPORT METRICS. . Sky Harbor is such a beautiful, large airport, with lots of different terminals, lots of different automatic walkways, and - get this - LOTS of Laptop Bar & Stool set-ups.  During my 2 1/2 hour layover, where I also switched planes, I got to charge my laptop, my camera, my iPhone, and my external battery charger:  I was set!. . WIFI. . Free!  That's all I need to say!  I was able to connect quickly and upload all of those pictures I had just taken of the grand canyon to Flickr, Yelp and Facebook.  I also did some blogging to boot.. . IN SUM. . I have no idea what the traffic was like to get to the airport... since I landed there.. . I have no idea what the parking situation was like at the airport... since I landed there.. . I have no idea what the TSA Checkpoint situation is like at this airport since....yeah, you guessed it, I LANDED there.. . But you know what?  As a guest of the airport who galavorted from one terminal to another terminal as a transfer to catch my next flight, it was not a bad deal.. . THE LOWDOWN. . The Sky Harbor Airport makes for a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
I'm sure it's a lot smaller than LAX yet it seems more complicated to navigate. As soon as I got to the airport around 9pm all the shops were closed. When I returned for my return flight around 6 or so, all the shops with snacks were closed. Only thing open was fast food and fancy restaurants. I just wanted BBQ chips and a soda. Oh well. . . Other than that, it's fairly clean. No sirens going off like at LAX (will review later). I asked for directions and the employees were helpful. Can't complain.
Phoenix Airport is fairly clean, not has busy has LAX or Ohare, have access to free wifi and the staff where very friendly and helpful.
The problem with most airports: not addressing the needs of its customers. Usually, we need to check in early that we end up waiting around for the boarding and departure. What do most travelers these days do? They use their smart phones or tablets/iPads to entertain themselves while waiting. What do most airports lack? Charging stations! . . Instead, those of us who are using these devices end up fighting over the coveted spaces that have been equipped with charging stations. I've noticed that some of the seats have outlets built in along the bottom of the chairs. Why can't more of these updated seats be added to the airports? Not everyone needs a small workspace area as I've noticed in some airports. Instead, we just need the ability to charge our devices while we entertain ourselves or work during the waiting period for our departure. Until I see an airport that does address these needs, I can't issue anything above a 3 star rating.. . As for the facilities, it looks like they've tried to bring in more restaurants with a modern look and feel. The restaurant areas look significantly better than the walkways and seating areas.
If Arizona is your destination, then most likely you'll be coming through this beautiful airport!. . Though I can't comment on the parking as I came through here and opted for a rental, I have to say this airport is spacious though it doesn't look as busy as when I went through O'Hare.  If you're doing a rental, be sure when you collect your baggage, you exit the doors and take a roomy, air-conditioned shuttle for a 5-10 minute ride to the rental building which is a couple miles away from the airport but as I said, not too far.. . Staff at the airport are friendly and always willing to help or answer a question if you have any.  There's ample signs on where to go for check in, luggage, or rental cars.  The airport is clean including the bathrooms.  WiFi is offered for free and the signal is really good.. . My only gripe with the airport is the lack of eating/fast-food shops like Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, Burger King, etc. at least for the gates that I came in or departed from. (-1). . Definitely love this airport and looking forward to making it a part of my future travel plans!
Easy to get around. There are many services and restaurant available to people with long layover. Security never takes a long time. It is clean. Most of the gate areas have  charging stations.
I passed through, so cant comment on parking and everything else. . Saw some posts about it being complicating to navigate through, I found it fairly easily to find the concourse my gate was in. . . Still gave it three stars because a lack of adequate plug outlets. They have small tiny charge stations with two plugs and 4 usb ports per side, but I'm not going to leave my phone or laptop with a stranger while I'm peeking over them.. . Rule of thumb I learned over my past few trips, have an outlet strip in your carry on.
I have never really had any issues with Sky Harbor. The inside and outside is always noticeably clean. the staff have always been helpful and I am able to get in and out as needed.. The only gripe I have is, for the un-initiated, the Rental Care center is a maze to say the least, when returning your car. Getting your car is a breeze, the staff at the rental car center are top notch, I just felt like I needed a magic compass to get my car returned.
I'm not sure if the security area is under construction or if it is always as screwed up as it was the day we were here.  What a mess, none of the employees could figure out how to get people through the line.. . The rest of the airport is ok.  There aren't a ton of food options if you are flying during dinner hours but there are a few places to grab something on the run.
Flew out from here in Phoenix to San Jose Mineta, though Sky Harbor tends to feel a bit small and undone to other airports like SFO or Oakland it's not that bad.. . It's clean and cool, which is pretty much all I can ask for with the heat in AZ. The bathrooms are clean, there plenty of places to grab some food and "Arizona" souvenirs. The TSA here is pretty friendly and got me through security with ease, while making me feel safe.. . The only cons was that the car rental building is pretty far from the airport, there isn't much access to outlets or charging stations and Wifi was difficult to connect to here. Other than that, the airport is great but could be greater with some small changes.
