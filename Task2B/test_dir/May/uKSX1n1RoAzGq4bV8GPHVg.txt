The food here is amazing! Everything I had was delicious. I saw this place on the food network and after I looked at the menu, I had to go here. Very cozy atmosphere and friendly staff.
This place would have received 5 stars from me were it not for the excruciatingly slow service. Our server, Barry, was friendly and our orders were placed correctly but he was notably absent for the majority of our meal. I noticed that a couple seated after us had already received their appetizer before we even placed our drink order. This guy didn't discriminate either, the table next to us actually left because he hadn't greeted them after 20 minutes. Other than that, food and drinks were excellent, short wait for a table, and the ambiance was enjoyable. We will definitely return. Hopefully this was just an off night for the server and not indicative of what we can expect in the future. I recommend the pork chile verde and baked goat cheese. I also enjoyed the Santa Rosa cocktail. All in all, pleasant experience despite the slow service.
One of the best restaurants I have been to in the Valley! Conveniently located in uptown Phoenix, St. Francis is a very attractive destination for any couple or group looking for a nice restaurant to spend the evening. I enjoyed the drinks and suggested wine pairings for the three course meal they were serving during the Restaurant Week celebration here in town. Everyone on staff is extremely knowledgable and friendly. I love going to a restaurant with waiters that are knowledgable and who are invested in the success of the restaurant.. . The cheesy bruschetta, chilled potato and leek soup, roman hearts salad are all excellent appetizers that I would recommend. The green pork chili verde is a savory and spicy entree. I have also tried the marinated flank steak, which was served a little over cooked and just okay at best. I am sure there are better, more affordable options on the menu.. . As for desserts, I have enjoyed both the strawberry shortcake and the sticky toffy pudding. Both were extremely pleasant and the perfect way to end a great dining experience.
Came for happy hour. Delicious cocktails. The French 111 was my favorite. Kids eat free which was a great surprise and the food for them was really well prepared. Cheese pizzas and chicken breast with spinach. . . We ordered the French onion burger, medium with French fries. So delicious. Also the pork chili verde with two yolky eggs on top. Wow! . . Service was amazing. So kind andthoughtful.
This is one of my favorite central Phoenix restaurants. Too bad I live so far away. We dropped in for some bloody Mary's this Sunday morning and also enjoyed a bacon fig scone. The patio is a lovely place to sit. The place has a great atmosphere. Inside, there was lovely live jazz music.
I saw the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives episode which featured St. Francis and with an upcoming road trip I couldn't pass up the chance to stop and try this place.  My husband and I shared the pork chile verde, the pork dip sandwich and romaine hearts salad.. . While the decor is very trendy and the ambiance is top notch, the food didn't really impress us.  I think we enjoyed the salad the most.  We thought the food was good but nothing to write home about.  We were really pumped to try this place and left feeling disappointed.  We just didn't find that the food had much flavor, maybe it was an off night or we ordered the wrong items?. . If we're in the area we might stop by and give it another shot and definitely try something else on the menu.
I'm giving 1 star for ambiance because that's all this place had going for them! . . Luckily we had a reservation because the place was packed, however, it still took our server 20 minutes just to introduce herself and get our drink orders. Our order was as follows.... . Baked Goat Cheese . Pork Chili Verde. Crispy Fingerling Potatoes. Roasted Chicken. and Pot Roast. . Nothing was bad, but nothing was great.. my favorite was the Pork Chili Verde but I've had better. Even their drinks were weak! At least i tried!
Loved it. I had the salmon dish. I would highly recommend this place. Im gluten free and they were very easy to work with. The others also loved what they had. For sure will be back.
After seeing this restaurant on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives i thought I would try it out.  The Pig Dip is the signature dish and it was everything I thought it would be.  Edgy atmosphere and complimentary valet parking made it convenient. . . Service was average and the valet driver was not afraid to hit the gas and squeal the tires on my Tundra.. . Go for the food, you won't be disappointed.
I love their food, however they get stricter with the baguette every time I go there. Why is so difficult to get a piece of baguette in this place??? Any idea???. And it is more frustrating the fact that I remarked please bring some extra baguette with my dish(since there was no bread at the time drinks were ordered) and my dish comes with JUST ONE slice of their famous baguette. When I asked the server for the extra bread, she replied "this dish doesn't originally come with bread". Thus, I was lucky that they delivered the dish with just ONE piece. Overall, interesting customer service approach!!!!! . I'm asking for 2-3 slices of bread, not for a free filet mignon or something like that. . I give them  two stars this time because of the above, hope the bread issue gets resolved soon.. Going back on Thursday to see if they read reviews!!!!!
