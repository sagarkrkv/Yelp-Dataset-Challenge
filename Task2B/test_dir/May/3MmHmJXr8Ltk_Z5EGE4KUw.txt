My first Bastiani Batali venture and was disappointed.  I love Mario, and had always wanted to try one of his places, and wow, not so good.  First, I'm a wine geek, so ordering a good bottle of wine, paying 200% markup on a bottle that needs to be decanted, and just gets opened when you order it is pretty frustrating.  But, ordered a decent bottle, we overpaid, as we know we would, and it needed to breathe more, but how can you order your bottle of wine at noon to eat your dinner at 8.  Oh Well.   My steak was OK.  I have had phenomenal steak in Chicago (Gibsons), and really, that is the measurement.  This didn't come close.  This really reminded me of a steak maybe slightly better than say Outback?  And no offense, for these prices, and these names/chef, I expect a hell of a lot better than "slightly better than Outback".  Won't be back.  Life is too short for a bad meal.
Dry aged bone-in ribeye is to die for.  The scallops and oysters were also delicious.  The staff were patient and quite knowledgeable for wine and food selection.  Menu pricing can reach borderline absurdity.
Carnevino is one of the early restaurants I've bookmarked on Yelp (2011!), and I've finally kicked this one off my food bucket list. . . First a disclaimer - my friend has a sister who used to work with the the staff here, so we had amazing service. With that said, onto the food.... . The appetizers - We got to try the Grilled Octopus, Carne Cruda Alla Piemontese (steak tartar), and the Lonza.. . 1. Grilled Octopus - I've never tried octopus this tender. Always have I thought that octopus is always chewy and tough, but the way Carnevino cooked it was amazing. The light citrusy sauce and the sprouts complemented the octopus well - easily one of my favorite things of the night.. . 2. Carne Cruda Alla Piemontese (steak tartar) - Solid steak tartar. Comes with mushrooms on top and what I believe are thinly sliced oyster(?) mushrooms on the side. Very good, comes with delicious crostinis. . . 3. Lonza - Interesting fava beans and ricotta salad. It was a great balancer to other heavier things, although I wouldn't really put this on the top of my list to order. . . Onto the pasta. . . 1. Beef cheek ravioli - This is a secret dish that I believe is from Mario's other restaurant, B&B. We got it with truffle on top. This was heavily talked up, but not exactly my cup of tea. When it comes to pasta, I prefer red sauce over white, meaning this dish was way too rich for me. Delicious nonetheless, but not my favorite.. . 2. Gnocchi - Surprisingly good. I never usually like gnocchi so this is quite possibly the best gnocchi I've had. Comes with English peas, prosciutto, ricotta salata. It's not over the top rich and it's really chewy. . . 3. Orecchiette - Sweet sausage and broccoli rabe, come in red sauce. This was the best pasta of the night. SO addicting and chewy. Get it.. . Now the main course - MEAT.. . 1. Lamb chops - Split between 6 people, we got one rack each. The lamb was so tender and did not have that gamy flavor lamb usually has. V. . 2. Porterhouse for 2 - Definitely the star of the show. You come here to get this. The filet side of the porterhouse was soo tender and juicy. Especially the part attached to the bone. One of the best steaks I've ever had. . . 3. Bone in Ribeye - This was better than the strip part of the porterhouse, but worse than the filet. All around, it felt like the better bang for the buck than the porterhouse.. . Of course they wouldn't let us leave without dessert...we had two things but the strawberry shortcake was money.
Our trip in was an incredible experience, beginning to end. Great recipes & great service. Go for the age dried Carne, 90 days of delicious!
Not much culinary expertise here, just plain meat with no veggies or sides included with your fifty dollar steak. Waiters r not polite either. Really wish I could return this over priced garbage .
I was in town with friends to celebrate my bday and we chose this restaurant to have a classy dinner. The ambiance was very cool although I was curious why they needed an anatomically correct bull in the restaurant. . . The service was phenomenal from our very helpful waiter to the sweet sommelier who recognized a girl who knows what she wants when he sees one. . . Food wise, we sampled a lot. This included our standout favorite, grilled octopus, light citrusy scallops and a salad to start. For our entrees, we shared a variety if steaks. They sure do undercook things here by a lot so mention your preferences more than twice. They thankfully refired the bloody as hell New York that I asked to be well done. I don't dig red cow- just brown cow for me. Oursides of asparagus and the mashed potatoes were to die for though. Love. Never had an egg in the potatoes before though. Our desserts were the pans cotta, a peanut butter thingy and cannoli. The peanut butter dessert came with a bday candle in it and happy bday written on the plate. Yay! . . All in all, I can happily recommend this place and will return.
We had pretty disappointing service here and the food was not worth the price we paid.  The hostesses were not very accommodating when we replied that no, we did not have a reservation.  We noticed there were plenty of open tables in the restaurant ... perhaps those were in fact for people who had reservations.  They told us we could sit in the bar or their next available opening was at 9:30 p.m. (no thanks), so we sat in the bar.. . The salad I ordered was only lettuce with dressing and a piece of toast with sardines on it.  How that constitutes a salad worth paying more than a couple of bucks for I don't know.  Our friend's pasta came out with a hair in it so she sent it back.  We waited a while to get a fresh plate out.  In the meantime, we asked several times for new silverware and no one could seem to be bothered to bring us new silverware so we got up and got it ourselves from their cabinet.  The other plates we ordered were mediocre at best - nothing to write home about.. . Overall this was very disappointing.  We often stay at the Palazzo and it is nice to have a convenient restaurant in the hotel, but we will not be eating here again.  Would recommend spending this kind of money somewhere else!
