Would stay again!. . Great price, great location, and got a free upgrade to the top floor. I was with a group of girls (all in our twenties) for my bachelorette party. We didn't care if it was fancy or not, but it was nicer than we expected.. . My favorite part is the flamingo habitat... In the concrete jungle that is Vegas, it's so nice to have a peaceful patch of land with waterfalls, ponds, birds, palm trees, and greenery. I'm from Vancouver so I'm used to lots of "green" - it was definitely a nice touch and the pond area / plants and grass was very well kept. . . I think the flamingo is an ideal place for young people to stay at who aren't looking for anything fancy, but still want something nice in the heart of the strip.
I will never stay here again. So disappointed in the service at checkin and at the pool. I'm used to staying at MGM properties and tried something different, boy did I learn my lesson.
I enjoy going to Las Vegas. I have stayed in a select few hotels over the years but the Flamingo is my favourite. . . I think it is important to understand where I am coming from before progressing with this review. First I go to Vegas to have fun. My wife and I enjoy walking the strip and shopping during the day. We enjoy the huge selection of restaurants and clubs. We go to party. I am 41, didn't party much in my youth so we do so a bit now. I don't get wild at home but in Vegas my wife and I relax and let loose. The last time we were there I think we had 2 or 3 beers while standing in line to check in. So with that in mind please take my review as you may. . . From the description above we come to Vegas to have a good time. Not so spend time in our hotel rooms. We do appreciate a nice room with a view and great service is a must. Iam just not willing to let some set backs distract from the real reason I am there. For those of you that are going to obsess about the room I would just say what are you doing? Get out of your room! The Flamingo does not have the best rooms. Non-smoking rooms are still smoky at times. This is Vegas, people drink and party and they smoke. While I do not smoke I accept that I have walked into this environment. I think the Flamingo does a great job accommodating their guests.. . So rather than go on about the rooms or service I will tell you why I stay at the Flamingo and you can decide for yourselves. First the location is right in the middle of the strip and barring any construction projects it is easy walking distance to just about everything. Second it has history, it is the essentially the last original hotel on the strip. Sure things have changed greatly over the years but you can't help but feel a bit of the history at the Flamingo. Third the pool is amazing. Is it the nicest pool on the strip? Absolutely not but it is a rockin' party pool there is no doubt. It is one of the key reasons we stay there. It doesn't seem to brag about itself but it certainly delivers. Forth my wife and I got married at the Flamingo so there are sentimental reasons we stay there as well. . . At the end of the day it is not the greatest hotel. Having that said we accept that younger people will be loud, drink and stay up late. I accept that there may be loud music on our floor and that we may walk into a cloud of smoke. Vegas is what Vegas is, and it changes almost daily. If you want a great location, and a great pool the Flamingo is amazing with a touch of history to boot! If you want to stay in room and shake your fists at those young people then perhaps stay away...stay away from Vegas as well. This town is all about that so I think some things are a willing sacrifice for myself and my wife. I dont' want to down play service, but lets face facts, if the service staff in Vegas can handle drunk people 24/7 I cut them some slack. . . So don't shake your fists as those young people, join them! The Flamingo has their shortcomings don't get me wrong, but please don't miss out on the big picture. I have never had a bad experience at the Flamingo and I have been there in the double digits of times. . . Stay at the Flamingo, enjoy!
Location, location, location! This is what is good and what is bad about this place. It seems like each time that I am coming to Vegas, the Strip is more congested than the previous time. This has become a nightmare since the center strip area where the Flamingo is located is really at the center of all attractions here and the opening of the new "Linq" with it's "observation wheel" has only made things worse. It takes forever coming and going from the area and parking is sometimes limited to "hotel guests" only so if you are driving and just want to come for an event or to play here, then you are out of luck!. . The upside of course is if you stay here and don't have a car, you can pretty much stay in around and have enough choices of casino, shopping and attraction within an easy walk!. . Traffic was not an issue when Bugsy Siegel opened the place in an empty desset patch in 1946, but we came a long way since then!
Years ago they started renovations but it seems they still aren't finished (or maybe they are... Keep reading). . . We had a new room - chic and sassy bed, leather couch, and fabric lounge chair. Our dresser and desk had absolutely seen better days. It looked like a dog chewed on the bottoms, they were so scratched up. Our bathroom was really disgusting. The shower head leaked, to the point where we thought it was on and the curtain rod wasn't installed properly so the curtain would not stay closed, therefore water leaked everywhere.  The toilet kept "running" as well.  So maybe the bathrooms haven't started any renos but they need to be.  . . Room service was great but note that breakfast takes about 45 min to get to you.  . . It's such a hike from the parking garage to the actual hotel side. Parking is beyond awful, there were signs up every night saying the parking garage was full and valet was full. However upon driving through the garage there were 4 floors of the valet portion open! . . 21+ pool was nice, there was a line to get in but it moves quickly. Have your ID!
I'm sometimes torn about whether to praise or lament about Flamingo - I've stayed there many times over the years and have had many different kinds of experiences. . . I want to stress that the staff is wonderful - no matter what problems I've encountered, every single person has tried their best to alleviate them.   One night I actually had to change rooms three different times, but didn't get angry because they were so nice, and of course upgraded me each time at no cost.  I've even gotten free suites and a limo ride home from a pit boss.  . . The location is great if you like the Strip, as you can walk to everything and get that "bustle" that belongs only to Vegas.. . Good variety of machines and table games.  Very nice coffee-shop type restaurant is my choice for most meals, although of course there's the ubiquitous buffet available as well as fast food.  There's a row of shops, and Donny and Marie were the staple entertainers at my last visit.. . So what's my problem?   It's the rooms.  There always seems to be something wrong.  Even if all seems well, the all-glass bathroom is not for the modest, and if one person gets up before the other who would like to remain sleeping, having the bright lights through all that glass makes it very difficult.. . The upgraded rooms have a fabulous king bed with the most luxurious mattress I've ever slept upon, a bath and a half (the "half" is off the sitting room, which is really nice for guests), and a TV in the mirror (although mine didn't work).  They also provide hair dryers in both baths!  However, my shower barely functioned and the toilet ran incessantly, so that wasn't much fun.  . . If they could just get the room issues solved, this would be 5 stars in my book.  It may not be possible, considering the age of the place, and goodness knows they've spent a lot on renovations over the last few years.  As long as the customer service is so good, though, I'll put up with the problems and continue to patronize the Flamingo.
I have to say my visit to the flamingo was not a pleasant one by any means. the only positive part about our stay is it was in the middle of the strip, so it was easy the get from one end to the other. Margaritaville upstairs is always fun and a nice view as well. . . it was a friends bachlorette, and from the moment we got there, she was in tears because she had been promised a room that was not the standards she agreed to. we were promised to sleep 8 with a pull out couch and had to beg for free cots. the staff was very direspectful and not accomidating what so ever. we were re issued about 10 keys because none of them work and couldnt even get into our second room for a long while. when we searched for the ice machine, we had to go to 3 different floors because none of them had working machines. when we asked about it, they simply said "did you check all the floors" which was extremely rude considering. we should not have to search all floors obviously; but instead quoted us $8 for ice to be brought to our room. They could not even tell us what floors were working. i blame our bad experience to the lack of accomidation by the staff. I will not be staying there again to risk another bad experience in such a fun city!
I have to say that this hotel was a nice surprise. You always see cheap hotels like the Flamingo, the Quad, Excalibur, and you are turned off by either their age or reputation. I have been to maybe five different hotels in Las Vegas so far and of those I had the most fun at this one. . . First off the best feature of this hotel is the location. Location location location, mid strip and right on the street. It is maybe a five minute walk from the Bellagio fountains. Next best thing about it would have to be the rooms. The room was the Fab Deluxe, it was a well decorated room. It looked larger then most rooms with two queen beds and a couch against the window. They had a refrigerator which was a nice touch, a cheap coffee maker and a flat panel television. The cheapest part of the room was the cabinet the television was in, but it did not matter. The most interesting feature was the wood floors, first time for that. It made the room feel cleaner. The bathroom was small but was decorated nicely. My only gripe about this room was the lack of mirrors. The only one was in the bathroom and that certainly is not acceptable when getting ready in Vegas. There was a nice spot near the door for a full length mirror, Flamingo take note.. . I requested a high room and that is what i received, floor twenty seven of twenty eight floors with a view of Cesar's Palace, very nice. Check in was not too bad and express check out was a breeze. The parking lot was a littleon the shady side so if you have a nice car valet it and bell hop your bags, makes life easier. Valeting your car for the weekend is preferred to because your right on the strip so no need for a car. I did not bother with trying the food in the hotel but they had a good selection of twenty four hour eateries. I ate at a couple of places close to my hotel like the famous Hash House A Go Go at the Quad, and Flavors buffet at Harrahs, both will be reviewed in the near future. . . Overall great experience with this hotel and the surrounding hotels. Price was great, two nights with taxes and resort fees $101.56 and that is a deal. So in my opinion if you want a cheap fun getaway this is the perfect place. Affordable rooms, food, and shows all within walking distance or right on the first floor. Enjoy!
I came here to celebrate my birthday and chose The Flamingo because of the pool and the price. You can't beat it! I loved staying here, we had a blast! I love that there is an over 21 pool where you can party and have fun. Everyone we met at the pool was so nice and the booty shaking contest was a riot.. . The rooms are nice and the location couldn't be any better! You are located right on the strip where all the action is happening. In my opinion, you're never really in your room anyways so there's no reason to pay to stay at a fancy hotel. I live in LA and have been to Vegas at least 30 times. I've stayed at so many places and I would put the Flamingo in my top 5.
The Flamingo Las Vegas - you can check out but you can never leave. . The Flamingo is definitely not the charming art deco hotel I stayed in a decade ago. . The reception area is drab and the front desk staff unfriendly.  The initial room my daughter and I were assigned was already occupied.  The desk clerk blamed the computer, muttered an "I'm sorry" and assigned us a different room in the "un-renovated" section of the hotel.   . The elevator made random stops to floors that no one had selected.  By the end of our stay it had become a running joke with other guests.  The ceiling light in our room did not work and we soon discovered that the running water in the sink had only one temperature...  ice cold.  If you wanted to wash you face with warm water, you had to use the bathtub.  The room furniture was old and mismatched, and the floor was a brown vinyl that was supposed to look like wood.  Everything seemed dirty.  The bed had a cover across the bottom that looked like an old shag rug from the 60's.  I later found a fingernail (not mine) in the fibers.   . . Later in my stay, when we were in the pool area for a short time, our room was robbed.  There was no sign of forced entry, but housekeeping had cleaned the room while we were gone.  After dialing repeatedly, I was finally able to get the Guest Services button on the phone to work.  After calling three times for security, and being told they would be up right away, we finally went to the security office in the basement of the hotel. A security officer took our report, and that was it.  Although management gave me a $50 food credit after I expressed my displeasure, overall my concerns were met with indifference and hostility.  A report was filed with CCMSI,  a Third Party Risk Management firm retained by Flamingo Las Vegas to review and administer incident reports.  By using a third party, the hotel management will tell you that it is out of their hands.  Apparently it is out of my hands too.
The Flamingo was disappointing from the start of this visit.  They had signs everywhere advertising their express check in kiosks.  I thought great idea, I will try it.  2 of the 4 kiosk weren't working.   Once I had my personal information entered on the screen the system locked up.  I finally got the attention of an employee. I explained it was locked up with my information on the screen. He said we aren't allowed to touch those.  I was confused,  why is that?  He said we just aren't.  I asked to speak to a manager. Joshua the manager made eye contact with me.  He looked annoyed and had the person I had been speaking to check me in.  I was told he would speak with me when he finished with the current situation.   He then disappeared inro a back room.  . Ok I decided to head to my room and hope for the best.  Remodeled room, maybe the main area but the bathroom looked like something from the 80's.  Old faded wallpaper,  not what I would call updated as advertised. . Well I thought I am here to have fun, shake it off and go gamble.  I went downstairs to get my players card, the woman said the computer was down and to try back in the morning.   This was all in the first hour. I. Am not impressed and that is my last time at The Flamingo.
Went here because I had the buffet of buffets pass and fingered might as well give it a shot. First off they sat us in a section where we could see the fish and the flamingos which was nice to look at with eating and that is going into consideration with my rating. The food was nothing special out of the 6 buffets I think this one would be the 4th best. I did come on a Monday for lunch so maybe dinner or a weekend might be better.
My friends and I stayed here during a last minute, impromptu Vegas trip--and that will be the absolute last time any of us will stay here. We arrived late Friday night and were told that the non-smoking room we booked was not available. We had no other option but stay in a smoking room that reeked of cigarette smoke. What is the point of reserving a room if they are going to give away our room to someone else? Doesn't it make sense to reserve the non-smoking room for the people who booked and pre-paid for the thereby requested room? We were told that because we arrived late, all the other rooms were taken. I'm sorry but if I reserved and paid for the room, it does not matter what time I get there. Upon arrival in our smoke-infested room, we tried to call the front desk and alas, the telephone does not work. Wifi connection and reception is horrible in this hotel. Although, the rooms are not so horrible, it is definitely dated. The bathroom is very small and even more dated than the room itself. The stellar reviews for the Flamingo must be referencing the Go rooms which they have only available as an upgrade, and was sold out upon our arrival. The casino itself was not bad, but I would never, ever stay here again. We paid nearly $300 for two nights for a room we didn't want that didn't even have a working phone.
We stayed here October, 2013. Initially we were pretty frustrated with the parking situation. There was construction being done around the Flamingo, but I called the hotel and they were nice enough to give directions while we were driving. Valet said they were full, the lot said they were full, but we found free parking for not but across the street. Fine. When we walked with all our luggage to to hotel, suddenly valet was open. Clearly some kind of poor communication. I had a bit of a freak out at that point being so tired and hauling everything to the hotel that they went to go get my car for me and park it in valet to make up for the problem. A bell hop helped us the rest of the way and even told us some of the best secret places to see. . . We ate at their dining establishments and got snacks for my conference at their gift shop (overpriced, but whatever, it was better than convention kiosk rates. The outdoor bartender at one of the locations knew a bunch of tricks which resulted in us hanging out there way too long and buying too many drinks. :) Breakfast was huge and delicious. I told the waitress that I was in a bit of a hurry, apologetically, and she made sure to get us our food pretty quickly. Extra tips for her.. . We got the GO room. We liked it. It was affordable and beds were comfy and the rooms were fun. I don't recall the casino or at least the hotel portion smelling too badly of cigarette smoke. Something I just cant stand about Reno or Vegas, which is why we don't spend much time in these locations. I love that the tram is behind the Flamingo. It made traveling to the end of the strip and to the Convention Center so easy. They have a little Flamingo/wildlife area thats kinda quaint to check out on property.. . We will be staying here again in September.
Very disappointed. Management did not deliver what we reserved and confirmed before our arrival.  Lots of  little problems and two BIG ISSUES, add up to a bad review and a don't bother recommendation. Try the Orleans, off the strip. Much better and free shuttle to the strip.
BUGSY'S cabaret ?????!!!!????!!! In Benny's own creation!?!. . Those who know the history of Benny Siegal know that he did NOT appreciate the nickname "BUGSY" .....his friends, called him Ben. If you weren't his friend, "Mr. Siegel" would do just fine.. . Thumbs down Flamingo, THUMBS DOWN...smh
The hotel is  getting worn down, but the pool is nice.  lets see here,  the room seemed nice at first but after opening the curtain I was staring at dirty roof and huge air conditioning unit.  This was the view,  but im not in L.V. for the room view.   The room was pretty clean and done up well,  how ever the bathroom is a different story. The caulking is dried up and cracking with mold.  It is obvious that someone added caulk over old caulk.  The decorative plate over the sprinkler system is missing and causing the paint to peel and the dry wall to flake.  The shower looked like it hasn't been cleaned in months,  and after using it, the water  would no turn off all the way.   For the price of the room I  thought it sucked. The buffet at the Flamingo is nothing to write home about either. That's breakfast and dinner.
I don't know why this hotel only has three stars. It definitely deserves more!. . I've stayed at lots of hotels on the strip over the years, but lately this one is my favorite for the money. Great value and the new GO rooms are awesome, high tech, with the same amenities you'd find at a much more expensive hotel. Resort fee isn't bad either. . . The GO pool is amazing. I'm not really into the dayclub scene, I just like to go to a fun place to lay out without a bunch of screaming kids around. The GO pool has affordable cabanas and beds, a dj, really funny contests to watch (ie booty shaking contests!), and friendly attractive people who are having a great time. I always have the best times in Vegas at this pool. . . So, it may look old and like a hot mess on the outside... But give it a chance inside. You won't be disappointed!
Well I definitely enjoy the Go or Fab rooms. The pool area is huge and tropical and you can easily spend all day there. Ive never had a disappointing experience at the Flamingo. Years ago, the buffet was terrible but im unsure if thats changed or not. The new food court is convenient and all the bars have awesome stylish souvenir glasses!!!
If you look up the definition of hospitality in the dictionary the Flamingo is definitely not mentioned.  Terrible front desk service.  I usually don't mention people in specific but Emilio who "helped" deserves dishonorable mention for being one of the least help people I have ever experienced. I booked my room through booking.com and clearly my confirmation stated I had reserved two rooms . Upon check in I was told they only showed I had one room reserved.  I was told I would have to take the one room get out of line and figure it out on my own.   Not until I got a supervisor involved was I able to resolve the issue.  Never once did Emilio apologize to me or tell me anything about the amenities they hotelhad to offer like the front desk associates around him.  I will not stay at Flamingo again.
Franchement rapport qualite/prix/emplacement top ! Et la pool party est top. Demander une chambre en etage eleve avec vue sur la piscine
Casino: . A little on the older side but overall great slot machines and table games.  . . Love the upgraded modern rooms and the prices are reasonable for being on the strip and centralized to a lot of restaurants and shopping.. . The staff is always nice.
Although this is a very old Hotel in Vegas, I still love it. The rooms could be better looking, but its an old hotel lol. I love the pizza spot they have there, its really good and inexpensive. Customer service is on point too. The pool is great and they play good music too.
Well - I am SO glad I didn't read any reviews on Yelp before booking, because I would have missed out on a fantastic weekend! My heart goes out to all you Yelpers who had horriffic experiences, but I must have hit the jackpot because our stay was so wonderful!. . I arrived early - 12pm - and check-in didn't start until much later. I got in line with high hopes. The lady up front suggested I register for a Total Rewards card which would allow me to bypass the early check-in fee when they had a room available. I left my bags with the bellhop and made my way into the casino. It reminded me of the casinos back home in MN, kind of old, and wasn't terribly flashy like I had fantasized them to be. However the (free) drinks were strong and there were PLENTY of people around which gave me reassurance this was still a great place to hang out. After an hour of day-drinking and gambling away $10, I decided to try for a room. I got to stand in the TR line (versus the regular line with about 30 people in it). I was helped immediately and went right up to my room. . . Our room - was honestly fantastic. I wonder (reading previous reviews) if all of the rooms are in a state of renovation of some sort, whether it is the bathroom or the beds or whatnot - but ours was pristine. The bathroom was huge! The shower was large as well, the sink was clean and enough counter space for 3 women.. . The beds were almost too-comfy and kind of sank in the middle - but I didn't come to Vegas to SLEEP! The stereo system worked well, and the view of Caesar's Palace was perfect. My only complain in the room is that the outside of the windows were pretty dirty, but whatevs.. . My checklist for a Vegas hotel is as such:. . 1) good location - CHECK (very central to all the action). 2) clean room - CHECK (make sure to get at least a GO room). 3) moderately priced - CHECK ($590 for 3 nights and 3 people = ~ $200 each). 4) pool - CHECK (the GO pool had lots of space, clean, good music). . Really the Flamingo has a lot to offer - if you want a Resort-type feel of luxury, I would not recommend. But for a good price and awesome location in the middle of all the action, you can't do better in Vegas.. . **OH! And a Strip View is COMPLETELY WORTH THE UPGRADE CHARGE! Trust me!!
Room was great, which, at the end of the day, is the most important thing. It a hardwood floor (hybrid?), which was nice, instead of disgusting Vegas hotel carpeting. Plenty of space, clean, nice tv.  I've been to the Flamingo a number of times and have yet to get a back view.  The strip view is obviously the best but even the 'back' view isn't back, now, if you don't mind a big ass glowing Ferris wheel. . . However... BRING A POWERSTRIP!!  No, I'm serious. At least in my room, there was a severe lack of power outlets and the six plugs that were available were being used by their alarm clock, lamps, etc. So, you have to start unplugging their stuff.  I was trying to do some work with a computer, hard drive, etc., and I had to work with the lights unplugged. . . Maybe I haven't been to Vegas in a while but check-in is 4pm...FOUR. Super lame. You have to pay $15 extra to check in around 1 or 2... lame. I had to because I assumed, like most hotels, check in would be a normal time. . . Pool. Now, good and bad. If you want a nice quiet time, those days are gone.  I used to like the quiet pool and I'm not even that old, nice and big.  However, they turned it into a "pool party" now.  If you're into that, cool... but if you have kids, you're hosed, but I think it's only on the weekends.  There is still a normal little pool area for families but it's right next to the music.  Also, this could be good or bad... if you're self conscious about how you look with a shirt off or in a bikini - don't sweat it here - believe me.  This was like the, um... how do you say it in a nice way... "blue collar" crowd.  Super red lobster tans, bellies, drunk guy on the pedestal with a beer bucket on his head.  I had fun though.  . . Parking is tight.  I went during the construction of the neighboring Cromwell and there were guards by the parking lot, asking if we were guests.  The guy interrogated me, asking for me key card, but as I hadn't checked in yet, I was about to dig out the paperwork... but he 'believed me' and let me pass.  Sucks if you wanna come here to gamble though.  And, I got one of the only remaining rooftop parking spots.  Hopefully they cleared that up by now though.. . All in all, this place isn't "old," it's historic and there's some charm about it that I like, even though it can't match some of the other mega hotels.  It's right in that middle tier of Vegas hotels.
Stayed here on a last minute Vegas trip since it was pretty inexpensive. First problem that there was no parking in the garage. All the spots were for valet, car rentals and hilton grand vacations. Finally found a spot on the roof and took the ghetto elevator to the lobby. Checked in and had to drag all our luggage through the casino with a bunch of steps to get to the elevators. When we finally get to our floor we have to walk forever to get to our room. I've heard the rooms were renovated but they're not that great. It's like when a house is flipped and they're trying to do the least amount possible to make it look better. The floors in the room and the countertop in the bathroom are new, and the rest is crap. Also the pillows are crap which is a sign of a crappy hotel. The pool area is pretty nice and that's about it. Still good enough for the price and location though.
