We went because of a groupon it was only $45 for 2 which included unlimited beverages including alcohol ( you also need to pay tax at the restaurant $3.65).  I gave it 3 stars because of the price otherwise I may have given it 2 stars.  The food was adequate - the ribs were dry with an unnecessary kick, fried chicken was flavorless, general tso's chicken was as dry as we every had, the ham from the carving station was dry, and many items were just too ordinary.  Having said that for less then $49 you got unlimited drinks and food.  The Mexican and salad stations were good as was the pizza from the Italian station.  We don't eat seafood but there seemed the be a lot of choices including crab legs.  Desserts were mostly assorted cupcakes that were okay.  They also had a crepe station and soft serve ice cream.  The stations included chinese, american, italian, mexican, mid-eastern, and dessert.  I could recommend with a groupon but not for full price.
Absolutely disgusting. After getting deathly ill about 10 minutes after eating the cold crab legs (yes, shouldn't have risked it at a buffet) I had to go lay down and was sick all night. THEN the next day I went to talk to the manager who was SO rude. He asked why I didn't say something that night.... Ummmm because I was so sick I had to bolt! And I NEVER get sick from food. He informed me all he could do was call hotel security and file a report. Complete BS. Don't go here unless you want to be sick from shitty cruise ship like food and then treated poorly.
Had breakfast here for $28 and from what I hear that's a good process for a buffet in Vegas. . . There was a solid selection and  worldwide selection of food. My favorite items were probably the seafood selection. The stuffed fish was probably my favorite item, along with the seafood salad. Overall a pretty good buffet.
We came here after many recommendation. . They do have a lot of choices, but most are lukewarm and for this, I stayed away from the seafood. . As a Mexican food lover, I went straight for that area. It made me sad looking at it. It looked like it had been sitting out for a long time. . Most of the food was mediocre at best. If you drink a lot of alcohol, I could see this being passable. So drink up!. Drinks were refilled quickly and the server checked up on us a good amount which is why this is two stars. . If you can afford it, the Paris buffet will be one of the only ones I trust at this point.
This is my favorite buffet in Las Vegas.(and I've been to almost all of them) the food is always fresh and delicious! They have all sorts of options(seafood, Mexican, meats, Italian...etc.)the staff is nice & they tend to cater to you well. I always purchase the groupon deal as it comes with 2 lunches OR dinners and ALL YOU CAN DRINK! That's a steal. It's become a Vegas tradition to eat here every visit.
Came here with a buddy and a lunch groupon good for all you can drink and eat around 2:40pm...I think it cost us around $20 each.. . Don't expect Bachannal quality food but my 4 stars is purely for the value with the groupon as we were both satisfied.. . Unlimited bottled Coronas and Heineken plus champagne...that was worth at least $10 by itself...so on the other $10 I spent of the $20 I got:. . Split snow crab legs. shrimp cocktail. prime rib (ehh..). Indian style skewered lamb (good). Some quesadillas from Mexican section with guac & salsa. Creme Brulee. Strawberry and creme Crepe. . Considering we kept rotating mostly between king crab and shrimp cocktail while drinking all we could, the groupon was definitely worth it and we both left feeling we had a decent meal for a great price.. . Our waitress, Rose was excellent, friendly and provided great service.. . I would definitely come back again with a groupon offer and hit the same items. . . TIP:. Afterward you can hit the sports book close by and watch some sports to settle the alcohol before driving home if you are a bit wasted walking out...caught some Yankees and NBA playoffs.
The worst experience at a buffet I've had in a long time, from beginning to end. . . The girlfriend and I visited because we had a Groupon (probably should have been the first hint) and and we didn't feel like cooking. We read the reviews before we bought the Groupon. I just thought the bad reviews came from those who were a little too picky (I was wrong.) So we went with a clear mind, willing to give this place every chance it deserves. . . Service (scale from 1-5, where 5 is excellent) - 1. . We arrived, and walked up to the cashier. Boy, she must have been having a bad day; not the attitude I expect from a restaurant. No smile, no hospitality whatsoever. Kinda made me feel like I want wanted there. Anyways, I got over it, we stood and waited for the host to show us to the table. Her attitude was not much better. Ugh, not a good start. We waited about five minutes before our server came and took our drink orders. I swear, there must be a theme to this restaurant or something. She looked like she was barely tolerant of our existence. Expected so, the worst service I have ever experienced. We hardly saw here throughout the dinner. Even when she saw us waving her over, she would ignore it. . . Food - 2. . Now let's get to the food. Oh...the food. The only thing that was good there were the crab legs, the shrimp cocktail, and the charcuterie. That's because you can't really mess that up. Everything else was just downright bad. The prime rib was completely overcooked and tough. The baby back ribs were overcooked and hard. The bread they served were rock hard. Pretty much nothing in their hot stations that we had were very appetizing. We hate to waste food but sadly, most of the plates that we got were full when they took it away. We read that the saving grace is the dessert station. Not necessarily. Well, they do have frozen custard, which is the best thing there. They also have a Macaron cookie which was done pretty well. They have maybe ten varieties of cupcakes, and are way too sweet in my opinion. The fruit tart, stale. The crepes in the crepe station are pre-made packaged. . . Value - 4. . I give this a four given that the deal was from Groupon; $35+ for two people, alcohol included. . . All in all, a pretty horrible experience, which prompted me to leave a review. I think they should seriously look into the service part of the establishment. It can make or break an experience, and on this occasion, it shattered it beyond repair.
It was an okay buffet since it offered a lot of options. Don't expect fancy food though. Our server was nice but unfortunately, he had a big area so took a little long to get our drinks. (I wonder why non alcoholic drinks are not self served)
Pretty good selection from the buffet on a Saturday lunch. However the quality was average at best. The service was good and glad I had a coupon and didn't pay full price. Seemed most there were getting the all you drink deal. :)
Got a Groupon for this. $45 for unlimited food, wine, beer and champagne for 2 people. Heck yes! Food was good, booze was good, line was short, server was nice. What more could you want. I would go here again any day and highly recommend it.
This was an average buffet offering. One of our party became ill after eating some seafood here. Not really anything sticks out in my mind as being great.
Average buffet with lots of food options. Because my mother is a platinum member through Total Rewards, we had the steamed crab, which was good. Main issue is that the service was slow. A lot of tables were not cleaned off in a timely manner. Ok buffet, but much better options available.
Make sure you find a coupon buy one get one otherwise i would say its not worth the price! They give military discount here. The buffet was $35.00. The food i had was good. They had many different stations. The desserts were hit or miss. Some were really good others were just really pretty with no taste to it and waste of calories! Over all for the 2 for 1 deal, its a good choice. However i heard they won some type of award for the buffet, i don't understand why.
Amazing breakfast! I had scrambled eggs, flank steak, smoked salmon, and so many fruit smoothies I can't even remember. Great breakfast experience.
Decided to check out the buffet because of a Groupon deal. Line to get in was super long. They had a standard Vegas spread of options: seafood, Italian, salad bar, Chinese, soup bar, dessert table. The food was not the best quality and they were too busy for the servers to get to us.
No break in between breakfast and brunch on weekends. So get here by 9:30 and pay for breakfast and then get brunch food. :) 10 am is cut off for breakfast on weekends.
The Spice Market buffet was fine at Planet Hollywood. There a lot of variety for most people, but as someone who's vegetarian and also doesn't eat pasta, the options were a bit more limited. Honestly, there was still plenty / tons of stuff to eat. I know I left the place over-stuffed.. . We had bought a voucher for this place from one of those discount show ticket booths. They said lunch would be $14.99 instead of some other higher price and the voucher itself costed $2 each. One thing that was annoying was when we did go for lunch they said it was holiday pricing due to the Memorial Day weekend, and we had to pay like an extra $7 or so per person. We had already waited in like for like 15-20 minutes, so were like, what the hey.. . The best section of the buffet was the Mediterraneanfood. By far. Not even close. All the entrees were really delicious. That happened to be my first stop and it definitely set the bar really high for the rest of the stations. Unfortunately, none of the others panned out in the same way. Nonetheless, even trying all the options got me stuffed.. . It was so funny, the group I was with was super excited and hungry when we got there. They're all like, we're going to chill and fulfill for the next 2 hours. It was funny, that only like 30 minutes in, we were all more than done. That's how these places operate, I guess. Just like tables, you can't win against Vegas...
