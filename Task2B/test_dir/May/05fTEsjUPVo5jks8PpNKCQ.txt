The food was soooo good. The meat was tender and the sides were delicious.  I ordered the brisket and rib combo and it did not disappoint.  Staff was friendly, attentive,  and courteous.
The best catfish I've ever had. The service is awesome. They've created a family environment that's unique. People were talking to each other like we were all guests at someone's house. Mamas banana pudding tasted just like my grandmothers.
Started off trying out Rollin Smoke Barbecue around two years ago with my wife and a friend. Our experience left a lot to be desired as our ribs were tough, pork was fatty with no taste and chicken was very dry. We decided then to not come back.. . Fast forward two years and WOW, what a difference, This food is dynamite!!!. . Let me start with my favorite menu item, the beef ribs. These things are insane tender with a ton of flavor yet simple, literally fall of the bone, fall apart in your mouth and moist with a great pink smoke ring. The server that brought my food told me it was like "prime rib on a stick" and boy was he right! Bring your appetite if you order these, they are huge.. . Brisket is darn good as well. Great flavor, nice deep smoke ring and thinly sliced. I have been back three times in the last two weeks (Hi my name is Paul and I'm addicted to good Q) and I have yet to get any point, only flat. I one day will ask them if they are smoking full packers or just the flats. If you ever get the opportunity to get smoked brisket point don't pass it up, it's heaven! (Point brisket is where the "burnt ends" come from) . . Pulled pork is good, but this is where they lost that coveted fifth star from me. I know it's tough to please everyone ( I have been doing BBQ catering for years) but I believe it's a big part of pulled pork to have a finishing sauce added when you pull the shoulder to add thatextra level of flavor. I use a home made clear eastern Carolina style finisher on mine and everyone loves it. . . In all this is the best Q restaurant in the valley bar none and I am so happy to see a fellow pit master doing well on his own. While my co workers and I ate lunch today ( 5-1-14 ) the line of people went out the door and never let up the hour we were here. Rock on Rollin Smoke, keep doing it right, you have a loyal customer in me, but only when I'm not doin my own stuff!
This is one of those places you go when you just say F--- it diet, im going hog wild! Really decadent food, a great occasional treat
My new bbq place to go to. Best bbq spot in the valley!
Amazing!!! This place is a must.  Fantastic BBQ. Super friendly and attentive staff and don't even get me started on the sides... Bacon potato salad, corn bread and banana pudding.  This place is awesome!!!
I was going to be generous and give three stars but then I tried the peach cobbler. . . When I walked up to the podium to place my order I asked if I could sample their BBQ sauce. The man said he would bring out the house BBQ sauce and some type of sweet BBQ sauce. I did not like either sauce and this should have been an inclination of what was to come. I ordered the two meat plate with pulled chicken and pulled pork and for my side I chose the baked beans. 10 minutes later my food was ready. First, I tried the pulled pork and the pulled chicken and both were less then impressive. I used some BBQ sauce that I had at home to spruce up the meat. Next, I tried the baked beans. The beans were good, I liked the chunks of brisket and I think their house BBQ sauce tastes better when it is cooked into something. Lastly, the peach cobbler was inedible. I took one bite and that was it, all I could taste was nutmeg. Still in search of good BBQ in Las Vegas and that includes the sides as well.
I have been on the look out for outstanding BBQ in Las Vegas, and I finally found It!! I tried this place solely based on the yelp reviews, and you guys did not let me down!!. . I went on a Saturday night around 8:30 pm. The parking lot was packed, the outside picnic tables were packed, and there was a line out the door. The line moved quickly & we ordered within 5 or so minutes.. . The menu is huge, so it might be worth checking it out ahead of time. I ordered the Outlaw Burger with waffle fries, and my husband got the Duo plate with chicken & brisket. We, also, got a side of corn nuggets & a peach cobbler. With 2 drinks, everything came to $25.. . You order at the counter, and seat yourself. Drinks & silverware are self serve. And, when your order is ready, they bring it to your table. While we were waiting, I observed a few people who were obvious regulars. Another good sign.. . Every single item we ordered was excellent. The chicken was super moist and flavorful. The brisket had those delicious crispy pieces on the edges. Waffle fries were crispy and well seasoned. The peach cobbler was warm and gooey!! But, the rock star of our meal was definitely the Outlaw Burger. It. Was. Huge. Like 10" high huge!. . When we were wrapping up our leftovers, they didn't have a lid for our cobbler...so they gave us a whole 2nd one to go. It was a little thing, but their service really impressed me.. . We left super full, and already planning what we were going to order next time. I, also, like that they are open late since I'm a night owl.. . If you like BBQ, you need to check this place out!
We were in Vegas for our honeymoon and asked some locals about where a good place for decent priced food was.  It was hard to find, but once we found it we were thrilled!  We are from Texas, so we know BBQ.  I had the outlaw burger which was HUGE!  We should have just split it.  It had almost a meatloaf texture, but it tasted smoked and I had to eat it with a fork and knife.  My husband had a full rack of baby back ribs and they were as big as the beef ribs we are used to.  They were fall off the bone tender and we couldn't finish them.  We are big eaters but after this lunch, we skipped dinner.  The owners friend was the cook and he came out and talked with us.  He was super helpful on giving us pointers on what to order and what else to do while we were in town.  Everyone was nice and the food was great.  (it's three weeks later and I'm wishing we could go back for more).
we went there for lunch today had 3 meat tro and ala cart white meat chicken.. first there sauce is awe full 2 the meat doesnt have a smokey flavor at all brisket uck! spare ribs tuff and no flavor, chicken bland and flavorless tasted boiled..  Only things that were edible were  the hot links and the potato salad was dank. hands down worst bbq Ive ever had   bar none
WOW!. The food is amazing....best item by far is their beef ribs and their sauce is oh so delicious.. For some reason I was thinking that they closed at 10pm. I just now realized they close at 8pm, which was the time we arrived at the spot. Not once did any of the workers mention this to us, they are so friendly and welcoming. I must've took forever to figure out what I wanted to order too - now I feel so bad for being a douchebag customer LOL. I even ordered it to go then we ended up eating there instead....and still, not one mention about their closing time. Thank you guys for allowing us to savor your wonderful product way past closing...kudos forrealz! On top of all this, hubby asked me to order another rib piece to go - and boy did we luck out. They happily took our order and sent us off with two pieces instead of one. WINNIN!. Beef ribs = easy 10+. Cheesy mac n cheese = 10. Rib tips = 8. Peach cobbler = 9. Customer Service = 10+. . Likelihood to return = you betcha!. . If you're a first timer, don't let the location sway you...you will sorrily miss out!
Really good BBQ in Las Vegas served here. A bit off the beaten path, but not far from the strip and pretty easy to get to from the highway (15). Family owned it seems, friendly service. . . I like the menu a lot. Decent mac & cheese, slaw, and other sides, and interesting items like wraps, stuffed with meat and other fixings. There's even fried fish if you're in the mood, and yes, it's just as tasty as the meat. The prices are reasonable, and the wait is never too long, even on busy days. I started eating here every time I needed my BBQ fix - check it out.
I can't give this place 5 stars because the brisket & sides were quite underwhelming. That said, the spareribs (naked, of course) and the bread pudding (flavored with Heath bar on this particular night) were absolutely to die for! Our server (his name escapes me, but he was a big Okie dude) was very personable & very knowledgeable about the menu. We'll definitely be back!
Big portions and friendly staff!
great service, reasonable prices, and really good food.  I had the dad sandwich and my wife had the potato with pulled pork.  Both had a good smokey flavor.  The sauce was not too sweet.  And had the berry cobbler for dessert.  It was good enough, where I considered having it more than 1 time, in the same vacation!
Oh my gosh I am mad I didn't know about this place sooner! Everything was amazing! If you are in the mood for BBQ and don't really need the "dining" experience that Lucille's or famous Dave's provides this is the place to come! They are by far better then both! . The gentleman taking the orders was helpful to is first timers, funny and knowledgable! . The food comes out quick so if you are in a hurry you won't wait long. . I truly enjoyed everything we ordered - pulled pork, spare ribs, chicken, brisket, cheezy Mac and cheese, kicking beans and waffle fries. In saying that I do need to reiterate how delicious the waffle fries were. Normally when I think waffle fry I think slightly soggy. These were far far far from that in fact they were so crispy that I think you could cut paper with them.
Hands down ... best barbecue I've had so far!  Lucille's and Famous Dave's are delicious but do not even come close to this place.  You won't find the "dining experience" here that you would find at those other places which have that certain 'manufactured' feel.  I'm in no ways putting Lucille's or Dave's down because they are still good.  However, Rollin Smoke gives you plenty of delicious food at a very reasonable price.  Oh my gosh, the brisket was so full of flavor.  My friend shared one of his beef ribs with me and I just cannot desribe how heavenly it felt sinking my teeth into it. haha.  My only regret was feeling like crap after a sleepless night and with a hangover ... after all it is Vegas LOL.  I really wanted to come here again on my last Vegas trip but too bad I was sick.  . . I came here solely based on awesome Yelp reviews.
The best Ribs in town!  Everyone there is helpful and the service is good. My only complaint was the last time I was there my order was incorrect. The food was still great, and after a phone call they did apologize for the mistake.  I would still say "GO THERE" you will not be disappointed.
This place was good, I will have to go back and try more menu items.  I kept it simple and got the bbq pork and chicken wrap with loaded mash and sweet tea.  Everything was good I think the wrap could have used more sauce however I did add bbq myself and that was good as well.  The sweet tea was good and the loaded mash was pretty good even with a little bbq sauce on it.  I want to try the ribs and more will definitely come back.  More of a quick eat or take out kind of place.
I had trio special. Hot link, brisket and chicken.  With corn nuggets. It was fabulous. Service was top notch. Only thing that sucks. Parking.
Like a pimp, Rollin Smoke BBQ is whoring out their entire menu for $24.99.  That's right....You ever walk into a BBQ joint and want to try everything on the menu?  Well here you can.  I wish I would have noticed that before I ordered.  Just the $28 rack of baby backs would have made it worth my while to do the all you can eat.  Smoked Meatloaf sounds awesome, and the burgers looked great too.  You can bet I will be back to try them on my next Vegas trip.  . . Truth be told, I should most likely give this place 4 stars, just based on what I ate.  The pulled pork was kind of a let down for me.  Not much sauce mixed in with it, I found it kind of flavorless, and not smokey at all.  However the sauce on the table added a much needed zing and saved it - 3 stars.  The brisket was better and had a nice smoke ring to it as well as a dry rub.  It was sliced in thick slices how I prefer it - 4 stars  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#0Lk8zyIUqCEMxyYmpGMTyg. . The baby back ribs were the best of the three meats that I tried.  They had a nice bark to it, but still fell off the bone.  There were plenty of meat on these ribs and it was clear they were slowly smoked and had a great hickory flavor to them.  Ribs are always the main test of BBQ for me and these baby backs clearly passed the test and are darn good - 4.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#fSy8vbKrCQuI8Sgv8I5qmA. . For the sides we tried the bacon potato salad, the kicken beans, the mac 'n cheese, and some sliced pickles.  The pickles were very good and had a nice vinegary flavor to them.  It's clear they will stand out well on any of their sandwiches.  Tasted exactly like the large dill pickles you get at Disney, in case you need that for a reference.  The kicken' beans, lived up to their name and had some spice to them along with a good peppery flavor.  There were some shards of brisket added in for some smokey flavor.  I personally prefer sweeter southern baked beans, but for some reason those are hard to get outside of the south.  Bacon potato salad, could have had more bacon in it as I couldn't really find any in there.  I still enjoyed it and it had a texture of a smashed potato salad.  The clear star of the show was the mac 'n cheese.  Some of the best I've had, it's very cheesy and creamy.  I don't see myself ever coming here without getting a bowl of it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#ph5LXQhF8FkZ-8nd6jVSfw. . Although we were plenty stuffed, I noticed a free dessert with check in.  All the desserts sounded great, but we went with the banana pudding.  No matter how full you get, for some reason, you can always manage a little banana pudding.  It just kind of slides down.  Rather than vanilla wafers it was more of a swirl of vanilla crust in the pudding.  It was ok, but I think I would try another dessert next time - 3.5 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#B-ruv_7a2ibeC_2NaLAEWw. . I love the vibe of this place, it's clear these are men living their dream.  The toys they have to play with in the parking lot are impressive, all kinds of mobile smokers and dressed up cars and trucks with their logo painted all over it.  It's like the bat cave of BBQ.  Holy Smoke Batman....To the Rollin' Smokemobile Robin!  And just like that they are on the move to provide smokey BBQ goodness wherever hungry folk most need them.  Also make sure you visit their party room and you will find a fun pig shaped fish tank that looks like a BBQ smoker.  Look inside and rather than coral you have all kinds of smoked meats for the fish to swim with.  Hit the button and smoke even comes out of the top of the tank.  Apparently this tank was featured on Animal Planet's show - Tanked. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#QMwyRQhoijuHeKKEaQLoeA. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#VrpJ5wb8xPouU_LyfaecEw
Went here today and it was off the hook.  Im from Louisiana and my buddy is from Tennessee and this joint is by far the best BBQ in Vegas.   It definitely brings the southern feel to Vegas....  chef is awesome......
This is a go-to for my husband...decided I had to try it. Got the trio of sliders with pork, brisket and the spicy sausage. Om nom nom. The Kickin beans are hot and tasty. Bonus: I checked in and got a free peach cobbler. Fantastic. I'll be back to try the ribs.
After sampling the brisket, pulled pork and hot links, I can safely say the meats alone are plenty of reason to come here. The smoke ring on the brisket looks like perfection and tastes like a gift from above. Sampled sides were a delicious mac & cheese (with two home made pickles hiding under the styrofoam bowl) and these fried creamed corn poppers that cannot be properly described in text - they are a delightful experience. The home-made house sauce is bold and flavorful and more than enough for most meals, but there are two more home-made sauces as well - a sweet sauce that compliments the pork very well, and a "damn hot" sauce that is very tasty and has a sneaky heat that gets you after the second mouthful. Great meats, excellent sides, great sauces and a friendly staff make this place a must-visit on your next trip to Sin City.
I walked into this place and almost walked out due to the diveyness of the place.  As I was standing in line, 3 separate people told me how good the food was.... and holy crap were they right.  The food was AMAZING!!!  I plan on hitting this place up every time I go to Vegas in the future.  The prices are very reasonable too!. . Expect a ghetto ambiance and go there for the food!  You won't regret it!
Big Bang for the Buck". . They do not skimp on the portions. We shared the Pit Special (4 meats 3 sides and a soft drink). For 20 bucks you can't beat it. Here is my analysis of the components. Brisket... nicely cooked but somewhat dry. (Put a little of their sauce on it.) Pork ribs... the huge fatty ones. Nice taste but too much fat. Chicken... very good. Hot link... spicy but excellent. Now the Sides: corn nuggets, excellent. Jalapeno cole slaw, a little short on taste. Bacon potato salad, excellent.. Next visit I would try the baby back ribs.. Don't trust Google for directions. It's not an easy place to find.
OMG!!!  My boyfriend and I tried Rollin Smoke BBQ for the first time tonight.  Can you say YUMMY and SCRUMPTIOUS???. . Let me start off by clarifying that this awesome restaurant is NOT in the ghetto.  It is in an industrial area.....big difference.  We found it to be clean and very comfortable!  Great service.....they made you feel welcomed, like you are a part of the family.  . . We had the 4 meat combo with 3 sides and the hot wings.  All items were super yummy!  The brisket was moist and basically melted in your mouth!  The ribs fell off the bone and were very tasty!  My boyfriend is addicted to wings.  He could not stop raving about their wings!  Next time, we plan on trying the "damn hot" version.  The hot link sausage and chicken were delicious also!. . But let me tell you about these addictive corn nuggets!!!!  Woohoo!!!!  Sweet and yummy bites of heaven!!!  YOU must absolutely try these morsels of yummy goodness!. . We will definitely return for more!!!  Thanks guys!
We drove down from Hurricane, Utah and had to try this place. This place did not dissapoint .For starters the corn bread is the best we have ever had! Period. It was light and not dry, didn't need any topping.The different meats, baby back ribs, pork ribs, beef ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and chicken were superb. the beans were spicy  and good. The sauce did have too much kick for us, so we left it off everthing. Can't wait to try something else next time. We talked to the owner, an Arkansaw young guy,, real down home freindly.
Keeping this short and sweet.. This was stop #1 on my Food Adventure Bachlorette Par-tay! One afternoon - 4 restaurants off the strip. Exploring was fun :). . Living in Oklahoma has lent me a very specific palate for Que.  I like my meats with little sauce and plenty of seasoned flair. Rollin Smoke could give the mid-west a little competition! We were also fortune enough to drop by on a day where they were setting up a photobooth for a children's charity.. . The decor was minimal, as it should be. Sort of picnic style. Ordered at the podium.. There was plenty of room for large groups. My party consisted of 7. We order a couple things to share and it was more than enough.. . Chicken and pulled pork. Holy. Hell. Both were super moist and tender. The chicken was my favorite by far. Nice smokey goodness. It had great smoke flavor and fell off the frekkin' bone. My two favorite things!. . Brisket- Sad to report that it was too dry for me.. . Kudos Rollin Smoke! I'm bring the man zone here when we're in town!
Until otherwise Rollin Smoke is King of Las Vegas BBQ.. . This is the best example of a small business that through word of mouth has become a smash hit with people everywhere!!! Rollin Smoke has come along way in such a short time, I remember when you could see the chefs in kitchen cooking up a storm from the front counter and the area when you walked in was the only place to sit.. . Situated between the strip and the 15 highway, Rollin is on South Highland Dr inside a small strip mall. You will see the smoker and or food truck out front, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled.. . The best recommendation for a Rollin Smoke lunch or dinner is: Everything..... From the Ribs to the Brisket and home made deserts, this place won't disappoint you. If your hungry go after the Outlaw Burger... It's one tough burger to get into, and you will be full after.. . I will say due to being on a few tv shows recently, the lines might start to increase, so get in early!!!!!. . Overall. Price: $$. Drink: 3-5 (soda - no booze). Food: 5-5. Service: 5-5. Come back: everyday if I could . . Catering:. I'll add In here I had Rollin Smoke come to my house and cater my sons 1st birthday... There wasn't to many kids mostly adults.. . The guys were amazing, coming early to setup and checking in on every one to make sure all was good throughout the party. . . Bringing in a smoker to cater the party was also a pretty awesome choice, I'm pretty sure the neighborhood was drooling at the smell. Highly recommend for anyone and everyone... Also a real decent price..... . Overall: top shelf
Hand down the BEST BBQ I've had in Las Vegas!  Beats the pants off those chain places and Big Mike is down home good people!  Stop in and git ya some BBQ and homemade cobbler ... you won't leave hungry.
Had the burger,  it was the shizzznit. I will definitely be back.  I plan on trying everything on the menu.  I will be back soon.
A fellow BBQ nut that was visiting Vegas a few weeks ago told me about this place and that I had to try it out... So here I am on business and I found time on my last night to go.. Wanting to try several things and leave my options open, I went for the $25 All you can eat.  It is not buffet, don;t worry, they ask want you want to start with and bring you more of anything on the menu.  I started with the brisket, pork ribs and the beef ribs my friend could not stop taking about.  . These are not your normal small, barely any meat back ribs, these are short ribs, and contrary to the name, they are not short or small. These are the "Dino Ribs" and full of tender flavor.. Enough of that, the Beef ribs were among the best I had, the brisket was a lean cut, I wish I asked for the moist / fatty , not sure if they have it, but that is what I try to get.  I found this brisket to be pretty good, tender & flavorful, I just prefer mine from "The Point". The Spareribs had a great flavor, the right 'bite', you do not want fall off the bone, many may think that, but the best have a bit of bite, but are also tender.  These were so.. The service was great, the guy that took my order was patient, he may be the owner, not sure, but worked with me on my order to make sure I got want I wanted.  The servers brought out my food promptly and since I had the all you can eat, they refilled me with more brisket beef ribs at my request.
I am a BBQ lover as other food items. I have tried several places here in town, one of them being a chain which was THE WORST hands down (no names mentioned).  Then my husband was introduced to Rollin Smoke and I have been addicted ever since!  A very small place with a BIG MENU! I have tried many things there and my favorite by far is the Beef Rib order. I  So meaty and tender I can't get enough! The Baked Potato "Spudtastic" is a meal in itself! You can order it with whatever meat you like and it is Loaded! If you are getting sides, don't leave without trying the Kickin Baked Beans, full of meat and flavor with a little spice kick!  No matter what you order, there is NO LET DOWN HERE!
What can I say, best BBQ in Vegas. No question. Everything is yummy but the cornbread is a must. Even the smoked chicken is soft and moist. They don't kill the flavor with too much sauce like some places. Prices are very reasonable, and the staff is super friendly and helpful. The location is in an industrial area but don't let it scare u away. It's a bunch of "normal" people eating inside ;)
3stars because appeasing to the masses, sometimes, comes at the cost of dullness.. Smoked meats are fantastic, but without a uniqueness in choice of woods ( Bleh - traditional mesquite and hickory  :-P ) or without some real body of unique seasonings,,, what have ya got?  If flavor WAS there,, I didn't taste it, and I ate slowly. I had the pulled pork and brisket. Both of these should be oozing with flavor.. I had to lightly sauce every bite to enjoy it.. However, the brisket was cooked perfectly, pork a little over but no biggie..the table-side sauce is excellent which got me thinking... Maybe that was their intention? To leave it bland and let the customers sauce it to their liking?. In Vegas... No balls no blue chips.
Ok, for you out of towners. This place is located in the industrial district part of town. In some ways it reminds me of having BBq in the Midwest. The decore is very, very simple.  When you enter i was greeted with a large menu on the wall, and a gentle men standing at a tall podium, I felt as if I was ordering from Bbq god, later found out that I was!! The food here was awesome I ordered a Trio: brisket perfect smoke and great seasoning. Pulled pork flavor was spot on yet a little dry, nothing a little sauce didn't fix.  Ribs were the best I have had in LV. A friend of mine had the outlaw burger and I tried a small bite.  Perfect balance of flavor, my only suggestion is to not over mix the ground meat, also mix the meat when it is really cold. The texture of the burger was off for a med/mid rare burger, really dense as if the meat was over worked, it was like meatloaf. Other then that, its worth the wait. This will now be the only place I will go for Bbq for a while.  GREAT JOB, R&S!
This place is awesome food here is excellent. I would really recommend getting the ribs they are so good. They fall right off the bone yet still retains a nice bite that you would want to get from a good piece of meat. Their sides are also really good the cheesy mac is super creamy and cheesy. . . The prices here are also pretty good. I would not consider it cheap but its a good value for the quality and amount of food you get. . . Service here is really good too. Everybody is really nice and helpful. Sometimes when it gets really busy it gets a little chaotic due to the tight space they have but you can still tell everybody there is giving it their all to try and provide the best service they can.
Best BBQ I've had.. We stopped here for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It's in a strip mall located near a Christian radio station and other assorted businesses.. . I had the BBQ club wrap and DAMN was it good. Delicious, filling, tasty, flavorful, cheesy, meaty. Plus they have sweet tea and I'm a sucker for sweet tea.. . The man had 1/2lb of brisket, and it was sooooo tender and delicious.. . Did I mention the BBQ sauce on the tables? Delicious.. . Our friends got a plate of various ribs which were fall off the bone good, and the same wrap as I.. . You must try this place!!
So far the best Hot Links I've had in Las Vegas (30 years). The service is friendly. More of a BBQ Joint than it is a restaurant.  Only downside is they are closed on Sundays which is my don't want to cook day. Looking forward to my return visit. Highly recommended for "backyard" BBQ lovers.
PRO:. This place is and easy 4 stars.  The BBQ here is simply awesome.  The brisket was extremely tasty and tender (smoke ring very apparent, none of that reheated meat you find some places).  I also had the Pulled Piggy, my favorite by the way, with the sweet and tangy BBQ sauce provided on the table.  In addition, our table also had the short ribs and meatloaf of all things and to say say they were delicious would not be enough.  Eat here for great prices great tasting BBQ, it's as simple as that.. . CON:. The only downside I could find and the reason for the 4 stars vice 5 is the wait time.  Understandably this place had a line outside but if the wait time could be cut to under 20 minutes a definite 5 star.
This place rocked my socks. It's so good and has an authentic southern feel. Their ribs & chicken are so bomb! Try the jalapeno coleslaw. It'll leave you on your ass!! It's so good and hot.  The wait varies but it's worth it. Kinda lowkey spot too from a tourist point of view ^_^
I saw this place on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and thought I would check out something local the next time I was in Vegas (as in non-chain and not in a major hotel).  Pulling into the location, it looked a bit shady.I hesitated.  Then I noticed there was a good sized line inside.  Maybe this is a local favorite after all then, right?  The staff was super friendly.  The food was meh.  I've from Tennessee and I grew up having great BBQ so this didn't quite meet my expectations, especially after reading all the rave reviews online.  I would probably not venture this way again, but I also wouldn't complain if I got dragged along with someone else.  Maybe I have a different standard, but I though it was just okay.
I tell everyone looking for a great BBQ here in Vegas that Rollin Smoke is the best in town! Maybe the best in the region. . . Starting with an option of all you can eat for just under $25 dollars (all day everyday, everything on the menu) and a large amount delicious sides, YOU CANT GO WRONG! . . *THE OUTLAW BURGER is the greatest burger. (beef patty with brisket, onions, bell pepper, onion strings, red cabbage, slaw, lettuce, tomato and cheddar.)
Yelp needs a new star rating for this place. Recently opened an office down the street and stopped in to get some lunch. The place is simple. Large menu on the wall, order counter, self serve soda machine. But that's not what makes them great. I ordered a brisket sandwich. WOW. It was awesome. I have been back every week sense that first visit and have tried many different menu items. Each one has been great. If you like food, you have to eat here. Don't be to choosy, everything is worth trying.
If you want some amazing BBQ this is the place.  I came here for lunch after hearing and reading rave reviews.  I came around 11:50 on a Wednesday and it was still busy.  That lets you know that this place is jammin.  Apparently you can call in the order and they'll have it ready when you come get it, (total plus in my book).  It's a little confusing to get to, but that shouldn't stop you at all.  . . I got the Spudtastic with brisket and a side of Bacon Potato Salad.  Everything was fresh and tasted amazing! This will definitely become a lunch/dinner regular for me.  The line never went down while we were there.. . Picnic style seating.  We sat at a table with some other people while waiting for their food and everybody was so nice.  Staff and regulars.. . Anybody who says this place is okay, and that  it isn't like "back home" is obviously prejudiced to wherever "back home" is.. . This place is awesome and definitely worth coming to!!
Having grown up in N.C. I'm a big fan of BBQ. Mainly pork sandwiches. I drove by this place twice and even heard about it through the grapevine. Overall, I would give it a B. I'm not comparing NC BBQ to Vegas BBQ, but some of the side items tasted a bit off and the prices were high.. . I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese. I should have noticed the word "pulled" pork as it has a different mouth feel than chopped pork. The pork itself was smoky and tender. Long strips of pork inside a hoagie roll. I added coleslaw to the top which was a mistake. The coleslaw (ugh) had chucky bits of cabbage stalk, jalapenos, carrots, corn and I swear I saw bacon in the mix. It wasn't sweet and it wasn't salty; It added nothing to the meal. The mac and cheese on the other hand was delicious. Oddly enough, it tasted like potatoes au gratin I just bought from the store. . . Aside from that awful coleslaw experience I would go back but not to order the pulled pork sandwich. The prices are a bit high and I wish tried something that was just amazing! I will have to go back when they aren't charging full prices such as after 5pm. Perhaps, the ribs and brisket are better.
Walked in and saw the Arkansas Razorback flag, and thought this place has to be good. I was wrong.....it's GREAT.  The baby back ribs were the best I've ever had. Ever. And I don't know what they do to the cornbread, but I hope they serve that in heaven. Good job!  WPS!
Definately try this place! We went with a large group and everything was delicious. They even gave us desserts because we mentioned Yelp.
As I write this I am about 60 minutes removed from the table and I am uncomfortably full yet wholly content. I was told about Rollin' Smoke Barbeque about a week ago and I have been wanting to try it since.  I can check that off the list now.  I went with a co-worker, the very same man who told me about it in the first place.  Immediately upon my exit of the car in the tiny parking lot I noticed the smell of BBQ smoke.  It was only enhanced as I entered the establishment.  Aside from the delicious smell of BBQ, which has permeated every fiber of my clothing and still lingers, I was greeted by a huge version of their menu posted to the wall.  I opted for the smaller hand held version though.  It was easier to read.  After looking at said menu for a few minutes I decided on the brisket dog.  I also ordered a side of corn nuggets based on reccomendations from my dining acquaitance of the day.  The hot dog was immense to the point where I gave up eating it with my hands and went with the fork and knife method.  It was a heavy gauge dog with a fantastic red color and the nice snap of a natural casing.  But it was difficult to actually see that beneath the truck load of fried onions, chopped brisket and nacho cheese.  What a gut buster this behemoth is.  Then there are the corn nuggets.  Little bite sized fried pieces of corny goodness.  It is best described as fried creamed corn.  It is crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside with the sweetness I have grown to love.  Frying it just adds to the alure.  After eating the dog and these corn nuggets along with drinking a cup of lemonade, I am stuffed.
Man on man! Just got done eating here and it was awesome! There were things that I had that I don't recommend like the chicken and pulled pork..not the best that I ever had but you gotta put alot of bbq sauce on it...but the most amazing things were the fried catfish, beef ribs, pork ribs, corn nuggets,brisket, hush puppies. I like the environment here it's very casual where you order your food grab your own drinks and just wait for your food to come out. Plus they are open late so thank you for a great meal I'll be back
Bomb!!  Definitely must try everything we tried was fantastic the Mac n cheese, ribs, chicken,pulled pork brisket and peach cobbler!! It so hit the spot!! We will definitely be back and let are friends and family know about this place!!
