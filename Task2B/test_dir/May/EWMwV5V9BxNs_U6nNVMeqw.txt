We loooooooooooooooooooooooove this place :)
Great food. Their juicy burgers are some of the best I've ever had. Great selection of unique mixed drinks.
Amazing service and heavenly food. The Fez burger couldn't have been bigger or better. Yum!
The interior design of FEZ is in poor taste and trying of a very modern restaurant. The whole design felt very forced and was completely lost on the patio. Several tables on the patio have no proper lighting whatsoever and are extremely ill placed. The dinner menu does seem to have some interesting options.. . I ordered the curry and was not disappointed, however, of course there are much better options for curry in the area for half the price.. . The most disappointing part of the meal was the margaritas drink special. The drinks were cheap but also the worst margaritas I've ever ordered. I would be very skeptical of order another mix drink from this restaurant.. . Several friends have suggested this restaurant is much better for brunch than dinner.
Everything is quite good with fresh ingredients, and satiating tastes. It seems though that the foods are conceived to be mass appeal with somewhat inoffensive and boilerplate richness elements like salt, butter, sugar, and oils. No foods that I've yet tried are extraordinary, or highly creative from the norm of mediterranean cuisine.
One of my favorite places, great for dinner or lunch . The music and atmosphere is hip! The Casablanca chicken sandwich is still my favorite.
Have eaten her several times and we get very consistant good food.  This is a great place to go!!!
Overpriced and average. Atmosphere is great, cool place but I've had a better burger from red robin and the fries tasted  like the frozen kind you buy at a grocery store. . . I doubt I'd go again, too pricey for mediocre taste.
I have been to Fez a few times with friends who love it and I keep hoping that it will grow on me, but it just hasn't. The inside is very loud with poor traffic flow and the patio is poorly lit and very close to the street. I was the lucky recipient of food poisoning from my last visit. I will not be returning.
Came here for relaxed dinner date.. Would defiantly do it again! . Had hummus appetizer, and 2 burgers. Yumm!
Great food!  Love there sandwiches, and on tuesdays they have 4. Martinis , Friendly staff, very trendy place. Cool lounge area and huge patio you can bring your dog on the patio
If you like blue cheese burgers look no further.  This place has the best in the valley hands down!!  It can get a little crowded on the weekends but the wait is worth it.  Staff is always friendly and attentive.
I love this place! Such great food and great drinks! The atmosphere is laid back and the staff is always friendly.
Fez consistently offers super customer service. The staff from bartenders, servers and managers always have a smile on their face. The servers in particular make you feel like you are home and they welcome you with open arms. The food is always delicious and the menu never disappoints.
I still think about this burger...so freakin good. I don't remember the exact name but it was the one with hummus and pesto. I was not super confident in the flavor profile on the menu but when the burger came out all doubts were extinguished...or should I say devoured?. . My husband and I took both our sets of parents and my grandma here for Mother's Day (two birds with one stone heyoo) and we were so glad we chose FEZ! Walking in feels like a super trendy upper crusty place, but the prices are really reasonable. Now that I know they serve brunch, I'll have to come back and check it out! We started with a calamari app, and were pleased with the preparation and the portion size. We also split a bowl of fries for the table and each person ordered a meal. We were all stuffed, even though a few of use saved some for later. The service was fine, not extraordinary.. . I dig it.
FEZ has beyond delicious food. My boyfriend and I ordered the Garlic Hummus for a starter and had the go green pasta as the entree. Both dishes were full of flavor and were extremely filling. The atmosphere is awesome and relaxing. I really enjoyed my first time eating here and will be back.
I've been here twice with very different groups of people at different times of day and days of the week. Conclusion: the food is ALWAYS amazing and the staff is absolutely wonderful! They are so attentive (without hovering) and I never had to wait long for anything! I took my parents here and they loved it! The ambience is amazing and you feel like anyone is welcome so long as you bring a good attitude!
Love this place! The cinnamon sweet potato fries are fantastic and have just the right amount of sweetness without being overwhelming. Had the Fez burger, hold the pears. I love it. Great mix of flavors on a soft ciabatta. Decent beer selection from some local breweries as well. My friends and I had a great evening here last night, with something so suit all of their diverse tastes.
This restaurant is fun for people watching and enjoying a burger or hummus with friends. The atmosphere is mod and groovy and it's a favorite among the gay community in central Phoenix. The only drawback is the music, which is mostly dance tracts you'd hear in a spin class. I recommend happy hour until 6:30 before they turn up the tunes.
Fez!. . We pass by here all the time and decided one day to stop by for lunch. We ordered a FEZ BURGER which I put in call caps because it is amazing. I cannot even remember the name of the chicken sandwich we also got but it was fantastic too. . I suspect all the food is good but it wouldn't matter they could serve strictly Fez Burgers and be fine.. . Personally non-plussed by the drink menu. I believe this is just a matter of preference however but a decent choice of mixed drinks and such. Just what you would expect from a modern contemporary restaurant. . . Will definitely come back, but probably just for the Fez Burger.
the best sweet potato fries in the word!
Great Martini's!!  Good atmosphere...would go back in the future!
Its good quality food, but weird menu items lol.  Never had a bad experience.
Had dinner here last night, and it was a great experience. The service was fantastic and my gyro kisra was really good. Loved the atmosphere as well-casual but still trendy.
The food is amazing, always friendly service and wonderful cocktails. I would recommend the Rosemary Chicken sandwich or the Black bean veggie burger. Both are equally good. If you happen stop in on the weekend get the Fez Benedict with a Bloody Mary!  You won't be disappointed.
Delicious!  Went here before a nearby show and the only problem I had with it was how much garlic hummus I ate beforehand... but that's not their problem.  I wasn't exactly adventurous in my burger choice,  I got the American burger with bacon added but it was absolutely delicious.  My party also got the kisra and hummus which as a garlic lover I couldn't get enough of.  I took a bite of my friends Fez burger (they offered!) and I really enjoyed it even though I didn't think I would.  The high reviews for this place are completely justified.
