First time in Charlotte and the VPOTUS delayed my flights by more than fifty minutes.  This time we encounter a bit of a jerk gate attendant from US Airways.  Really unprofessional in her handling of a traveler that happened to have missed her earlier calls to him.  Heck, he still had over thirty minutes before boarding and his seat was given away.  For that, not feeling the love here.  . . Reeks of jet fuel/exhaust in the E Concourse too.  Close the doors much?
Other than the food court that is built at the intersection of the terminals, there is nothing much at this airport to write about. Unfortunately, I need to fly in here every week from Tampa to catch my connection which happens to be to Jackson,MS at the time of writing of this review. With the gates built so far apart and narrow walkways. It takes me a full 15 mins to move from gate to gate. Been close to missing my flights a lot of times. High time they build a shuttle or  train service especially with this being a US airways hub.
I use to be based at the 145th Airlift Wing in Charlotte NC a long time ago and don't get  chance to go back often.  So when I do I am always impressed by what I see. Sometimes it is good and sometimes it isn't. . . This last time I was really impressed. I had to go to the airport to pick up a friend I have to say it was quite an impressive trip. There is a lot of construction going on and whenever that happens it can usually be hard to get in and out of where you need to go.  I found it to be much to my surprise very easy. I asked an employee where I should go to wait for someone to land and they helped me look up there flight and we found out it was delayed. So the gentleman guided me to a parking lot and then talked to the lady driving and told her where I was going. Top notch service. . . The parking was only a $1 per hour. I'm not use to paying for parking where I am from but I remember paying around $15 in Chicago so this wasa bargain! I might be getting older and not liking a lot of movement so I tend to not much like going to airports but I found this to be a pleasant experience.

Well for an airport I really have no complaints. It may not be the biggest airport there is but it does have the best USO I have been too. Serving hot and cold food 24 hours a day, meals are free here. They do ask for donations if possible and to not take the food on the plane with you. They also provide WiFi,  computers, comfortable reclining chairs to watch TV or a movie, or even nap in. Even with out the USO I really like our airport. Its simple to maneuver in and always very clean.
Avoid at all costs, especially if flying USAir. Customs was worse than JFK. THIS IS NOT the airport for international connecting flights. Completely understaffed for an excessively busy Sunday. Worst combination of southern efficiency and northern charm. Better to go through Miami.
Nice airport. When you are picking someone up you can go to the cell phone lot and wait for them to text. I hear they have rocking chairs but have not tried them yet. Parking across for the terminals would be great. Cant wait until they are finished
I don't usually fly out of charlotte. I'm a slave to southwest at Raleigh, but southwest now has a very small amount of flights out of Charlotte so that may change.. . Right now there is construction surrounding and inside the airport.  If you are doing long term parking give yourself an extra 30 minutes of what you think you need.  It took me more than 10 minutes to even find a parking space!  Thankfully I got there earlier than expected and it saved me from missing my flight.. The construction on the inside is at baggage claim and many of the conveyor belts are out of service.  This means airlines have to share one belt and it was a clusterfrack.  The plus is they had way more than normal baggage attendants and everyone seemed to be getting attended to.  . I'll use Charlotte again, I go where the best price and route times are so I'll be back.  Soon I hope traveling to the clear blue sea.
The best airport. Undergoing Parking Garage expansion and new road directions when completed it will be easy to navigate.
I Love visiting Charlotte North Carolina ! Gr8 BBQ and nice people. The Airport is rather large so be prepared to walk. The airport is clean and convenient. Very productive and secure. Love the TSA agents and their ability to keep us safe.
Tsa staff are very polite and they move quickly. I went through security in 2 minutes and made it on my plane after grabbing a bagel by 7:30 when I arrived at the airport at 7:15. My plane takes off at 7:50...Perfect!. . Cool/weird white rocking chairs in random spots. Also, dirty carpet they should change the carpet to tiles.
I'm hoping this place comes around once the construction is complete. It's a little tight and cramped and crowded. For years, you can wait a very long time at baggage claim. Recently, it was pretty quick; rivaling other airports.
On the plus side: for on time departures this is one of the best airports in the country. On the negative: it feels like a cattle feed lot, everything is done on the cheap. Cheap seating, no power outlets, cheap everything. It looks and feels second rate and second hand.. Another negative is the near 100% probability that you will land at concourse A or B and be forced into a 45-minute death march through hordes of grumpy, uncivil travelers in your hurried walk to concourse E. There is only junk food and 2000 calorie meals to be had anywhere, which is a standard Charlotte meal judging by the waistlines here. Bring an apple and try to keep your layover to a minimum.. . But I want to stress that I would rather fly through Charlotte than almost any other airport because of the outstanding chances that my flight will be on time. Charlotte saves me time over airports like Philly or O'Hare because I rarely miss a connector. That is, after all, the whole point. But really, I wish they would consider a charging station here and there. And maybe get rid of the butt-killing chairs.. The WiFi is Free and almost worth the price.
Usually end up here for lengthy layovers. Some of the concourses are very nice and others feel old and dirty. Always check the airport screens when you are changing flights as they seem to change almost every time I've gone. . It is a very large airport and your connecting flight will undoubtably be far from where you land so expect to be walking and with a short layover this may mean running.
Never again!! This place is overcrowded and talk about walking to catch a connecting flight? RIDiCULOUS! It felt like I was running a marathon to get to my LAX flight from Greensboro - both on American!!
Our company favors US Air, so we fly through Charlotte every once in a while. We've never flown in to stay, nor out. We've only made connections here. Much appreciated is free WiFi. All airports should be doing that. Rocking Chairs is a great place to chill if you have the time. When making a connection, however, food choices are limited. We were in a wing last time with only a fast food chicken or the Speedway Grill as choices. We ended up at the latter, and were not impressed.
Man! Clean airport with really nice ppl. Altho my flight got cancelled I think it was because the pilot didnt want to land because of 'fog'. I always like traveling through here though.
Nice clean airport.  Lots and lots of flights so it gets crowded.  Once everyone is gone, it's nice.  Bathrooms are spectacular. For those of you trying to connect to the wifi at the end of terminal A, go to gate A6 and view at the airport map nearby.  Then connect.  There is spotty connections at the end of that terminal hampering the user agreement website from openong.
I fly US Airways all the time but I'm based in Phoenix, Charlotte needs to spend a day in PHX and understand what restaurants need to be in an airport, the food in Charlotte really sucks, it's all the crap that PHX ran off. The gates are all too small, not enough seating and for god sake turn the AC down. And to top it off the US airways club closes at 10pm so grab you stuff and get out! Sea of people not enough seating and the food is junk, nice airport, no not really.
The best thing about Charlotte Douglas International Airport? They have a great track record for on time departures. Woo!. . The worst thing about Charlotte Douglas International Airport? If you have a connecting flight, it will be flying out of the complete opposite end of the airport from where your other flight lands. At least that is what has happened to me every single time, and no, I'm not switching carriers. . . There really isn't anything too horrible or too great about this airport. I've always found the bathrooms surprisingly clean, I like the random rocking chairs stationed throughout the airport, and it is very easy to navigate, even if you have to run from one end to the other to make your connecting flight. Food options, however, are very limited, especially first thing in the morning, when everything that isn't Starbucks is closed. Also, the gates are small and cramped and lacking in seating, and electrical outlets are few and hard to find.
This airport is huge!  If you're here for a short layover be prepared to book it if your connecting flight is on the other side of the airport..it'll take a while!  Luckily I had plenty of time, but I saw tons of people running down the long terminal corridors to get to their gate. It's a nice airport, well kept and has plenty of space and seating.
One of the nicer airports to fly into, out of and thru. This is my home airport but since it is also the largest Hub for US Airways I also have to fly thru during business travel. You walk from furthest points in about 15-minutes if you use the moving walkways and walk at a good steady pace. You have food and if you desire shopping options in all concourses. TSA Precheck at all concourses as well. You will find rocking Chairs in the main food court area as well as the E Concourse. A big item is that you have free WiFi! The biggest downside to the airport is finding enough charging outlets in the airport. It is for this reason that I give it a 4-Star rating instead of a 5-Star.
Blech. This airport is kinda dirty and smells sour. It's also overly crowded since it is a layover hub, if you are in a rush to get to a  connecting flight you will no doubt be stressed out. One good thing, it's not as bad as a certain Chicago airport I won't mention by name.
Not bad for a hub, enough to see and eat to keep you busy for a bit but watch out for the creepy bathroom attendants.  You feel like you stepped out of the airport and into a sleazy nightclub when you hit the WC.. . Between ATL and CLT I would fly through Charlotte any day of the week.
Really an easy airport to navigate  Check in not a hassle
Airport is okay, but they deprive Concourse D and E of restaurant and or food choices. Terminal B has plenty and there's also some in the middle, just before turning towards concourses C and D. If you're taking off from D, don't be alarmed, there is a brewery/restaurant at the very end called Carolina beer Co, as well as a bagel place. Looks the airport is going through some remodeling. Not bad, gets busy though
