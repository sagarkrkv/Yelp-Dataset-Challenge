Came for the fame, and it did not disappoint! (other than my wallet... oh god). . . $50+ and I think their price is going up every year!. . This place is HUGE, I get lost at where I am sitting for the first few times getting food back to my table. Nice decoration, they design it into sections and each section gives you different atmosphere. Ambiance is a little darker than my liking. . . Service is great, attentive and courteous. They would swap your drink even before you finish your previous glass. Nothing to complain and meets my expectation of a buffet this price range. . . Food quality definitely superb! With varieties from various parts of Asia, Europe, and America. Their cookware are all super expensive Le Crueset or Staub. Fresh seafood, and GET THEIR WARM KING CRAB LEG near the pizza section. From many posted pictures in yelp you can already tell they give you TONS. Desert is good, their gelato is okay not the best I've had, but I am very picky when it comes to desert. . . My dilemma when eating here is that since I'm paying so much already, I feel like I intentionally skipping all of the food that seems cheaper to make and will fill you up (carbs), like fried rice, taco, bread, hotdog... etc. However, I know I'm also missing out quite a lot because they could taste wonderful. And seafood is... just seafood. They are fresh, and high quality, but other buffets for $10 or $20 cheaper will have the similar seafood as well. So its a struggle to decide what to pick up to eat if you only have one chance. Maybe they should raise the price a little more, but make it a one-day-pass sort-of deal. So you don't have to stuff yourself up so quickly and can have more time enjoying all of the dishes. . . Oh they change their dishes every other hour or so, so sit for a little longer, you might find something new.
Second best buffet in Vegas.  I think Wicked Spoon edges it out, but this place is fantastic.  There are a lot of interesting dishes and they're all good.. . Personal favorites were the kobe sliders and the dim sum buns.. . All the strip buffets are priced about the same, so you know what you're getting yourself in to going in.  If you decide to do a strip buffet, this is a fine choice.
A huge selections for you to choose from.  We were there for like 3 hours chilling out and enjoying the food. My family must have eaten away at least a week long worth of food there.
Instructions on how to get in to Bacchanal Buffet:. 1.) line up at the kiosk machine and enter your name, your party size and specify if it's for a special occasion. & lastly, don't forget to put your phone number! Bacchanal will text you when your table is ready. Take your ticket and wait.. . 2.) don't be frightened by the wait time (65-70 minutes). This is just an estimate. I was told there will be an hour wait, so I walked to The Forum, bought a tie, and received a text shortly after. I only waited 15 minutes! . . 3.) give your ticket to the employees by the podium and they will check you in. . . 4.) walk a few steps forward and pay the cashier. I ended up paying $200 for 4 guests. I don't usually spend ~$50/person at a buffet, but it was our first time and everyone is raving about how good it is, so I took my family here. . . 5.) the photographer takes your picture. . 6.) and last but not least, you are finally seated. . . The server asked what we wanted to drink. My brother got ginger ale (free with meal), my other brother got sprite (also free), and my mother ordered an unsweetened iced tea (also free). I ordered a mimosa. Our server informed us that a glass of mimosa is $7, while the endless/all you can drink mimosa is $10. Of course I went with the endless mimosa. For $3 more, I can drink till my heart's content. ^____^ must I add that I really love mimosa. So, best believe I drank $10, or.... rather $50 dollars worth of mimosa LOL.. . -- Moving on to the food --. From my table, I can see that Bacchanal had a lot to offer. The buffet is broken down into different sections/cuisines. I didn't know where to begin, or how far the room stretched. I just knew that I had to walk every inch of the buffet before I took my pick. . . I found myself in the back of Bacchanal and saw a lady treading the room and thought to myself: "what's the hurry?" My eyes followed the lady and watched as she received a fat serving of hot, steamy king crab legs straight from the pot!! At that moment, I knew I was no longer Cindy. Oh no no no.. I was Ruby the Copycat. I took a plate and went straight for the King Crabs lol. . . I walked back to my table, dropped off my plate of hot and steamy crab legs and made my way to the seafood section. I got an assortment of seafood as well as raw oysters and shrimp cocktail! YUM!!! . . I went back for more servings of crab legs and shrimp cocktail. I couldn't look at seafood anymore after eating so much of it. So I went on an adventure and found myself in the Vietnamese cuisine section. In the far back, they served pho! Oh what the hellzzzzz. But I eat pho so frequently, that I decided against it. I walked further and found the Japanese section. I loaded up on the sushi, onigiri, miso soup, California rolls, and eel rolls. I grabbed another plate and loaded on the edamame. As I made my way back to my table, I couldn't help but double fist and dance my way back.. . I ate and I ate.. And soon enough 3 hours had flew by. Where the time went? Idk, but I wasn't going to question or ponder why/where/how the time flew by so quickly. I was in my happy place. And I'm not going to stop stuffing my face just because of time. . . The food was delightful. Every bite reminded me that the gruesome three hour drive was worth it! As the plaque noted, Bacchanal Buffet is truly "a feast worthy of Gods."
This is my favorite buffet out of all the casino buffets in Vegas! You definitely get your money's worth when you come here! Expect to wait at least an hour before you can get in. They have now made is more easy with a number system. You sign in at a computer and it tells you what time you can come back for you table which makes it super convenient. You can make time pass by faster by walking around the casino floor or making your way to the forum shops and back! . .  Seafood is every night so you don't need to wait for the weekend to get those crab legs, oysters, mussels, or shrimp that you've been craving. They have an awesome asian section that serves a blk chicken medicinal soup which is very surprising to me since it is not something that an average person will drink. It has a lot of Chinese herbs in it including ginseng which has a very distinctive taste.. . They have a station where they will make you pho, ramen, and udon. They offer a wide variety of different meats to choose from in the meat carving station. Lamb, sausages, prime rib, flank, and chicken to name a few. . . The hispanic station has fresh juices that you can pick up in glass containers. Horchata, Guava, Strawberry to name a few. Horchata was a big hit at my table. Just the right amount of cinnamon! . . If you are looking for gelato, mochi, or crepes this place has it all for you. Chocolate covered strawberries also available dipped in white chocolate, sugar free dietary selections, creme brulee, and tirimisu on some nights.. . All and All, definitely a place you want to check out at least once when you come to Vegas. Nothing will compare to this buffet afterwards!
The best Food experience you will ever have !!!. . Food verity - 10/10. Food quality - 9/10. Atmosphere - 9/10. Price - fair. . All and all - unbelievable!!!. Very much recommended.
Holy cow.. . I'd heard about Vegas buffets before but had never eaten at one.  After having breakfast at Bacchanal buffet one morning during my most recent stay, I get it now.. . Not only was I full until dinnertime, I also had the choice to eat pretty much anything my heart desired.  The wide range of foods went anywhere and everywhere from shrimp cocktail to chilequiles, beef chow fun to pizza.  Mind you, this was at 7am when they opened.  Don't askme why I was up at 7, and yes, I had gone to bed from the night before.. . I stayed pretty much within the realm of standard breakfast indulgence, eggs benedict, breakfast potatoes (I had my choice of at last four types,) bacon, a frittata type dish with Brussels sprouts and other veg, SLAB BACON.  Dude, they were carving SLAB BACON to order.  The slice I got was like a friggin' steak.  Graham and I had to share it.  They also had breakfast burritos, shrimp and grits, bagels.... . In addition to stuffing myself (c'mon... this buffet was over $40 per person, did you think I wasn't going to make sure I didn't have to eat again until dinner?) with those items, I did get down on some shrimp cocktail, smoked trout, mussles, and a TON of great coffee.. . Bacchanal buffet.  I'm not normally a buffet fan.  At all.  But you're a'ight in my book.
Tips to make your experience here enjoyable:. . - You can pay $15 extra to get in the express line and avoid a 2 hour wait to get in, but on a busy day the wait can still be very long.. . - The most important tip if you like crab legs. They have cold and HOT crab legs. If you want them hot go to the Italian station at the other end of the buffet where you see some cooks making pizza. Ask the guy next to the big pots.. . - The line for the taco bar is very long so it's best to get a couple or don't plan on coming back.. . - Make sure you don't get an end piece of prime rib. They are overcooked and dry. Ask for a middle piece that's pink.. . - Avoid the pad thai, mac and cheese, macaroons, tofu cake pops, and churros.. . Overall there are a lot of options and I find myself choosing this place over Wicked Spoon. The seafood is top quality. Of all things I enjoyed their dim sum. They have great cookies and flan, but I found most of the desserts underwhelming. A top 5 buffet in my book.
We had been wanting to try the Bacchanal Buffet for months so we were so excited to finally have the opportunity to try it yesterday. We arrived and the wait was 101 minutes which was a bit insane. We ended up getting seated in 45 minutes which we were thrilled about. Once we walked in I was already disappointed with the selection they offered for what is known as "the #1 buffet in Vegas." I think the biggest disappointment was having to wait in a 20-30 minute wait to get your food. Unlike other buffets where you walk up to a station to grab food, you had to wait in an extremely long line to get all of your items. It was a bit ridiculous. We ended up eating the food we grabbed as we waited. The best items they offered were the steak tacos, sliders, crab legs and pizza. Everything else was so/so. Also, the breakfast selection was highly disappointing. They did not offer omelets, pancakes; many of the popular breakfast items. The best thing about this buffet was that mimosas are included in the $45 price (for Sunday brunch.) I feel bad giving it two stars as the service was REALLY good, our waiter was on point and always ensured we had drinks which was awesome. I think because Bacchanal has always been marketed as the #1 buffet I had much higher expectations, especially since it is one of the most expensive buffets on the strip. I would much rather eat at Wicked Spoon at Cosmo or at Aria's buffet.
I've attempted this place 3 times. First time was on Christmas Eve and the wait was 334 minutes according to the kiosk ticket. Then I tried again on New Year's Eve and they weren't giving out passes anymore. Tried again on a Sunday around 4pm & there was no line and I was seated right away. The food was amazing!!!! I didn't even get to 2 of the stations because I was so stuffed.  They try to ask you to limit your dining time to 2 hours but if I'm paying $51 per person I will sit there as long as I want!! I was there for 2.5 hours. It was delicious and the cooks were constantly rotating the foods so it was never there for more than what seemed like 1 hr. . . Tip....go when dinner first starts (4/5pm)and there usually isn't a crazy wait time or wait at all.
Having dinner 1st at the Wicked Spoon, my expectation fell short. With a more options as far as entree's I felt they were not as tasty as the Wicked Spoon. I expected better for being a pricier place but quantity cannot replace quality. Don't get me wrong they are good but think twice about shelling out more clamps when I've experience a better quality place with less money,
As ungodly lavish buffets go, this is the top of mount Olympus. Most of the items are 4 star which in itself is an achievement for a lunch buffet (hence the five stars). The oriental station was my favorite. The dessert station is a visual feast far more than a culinary feast (though, that is not to say it is sub par, just that there is nothing to die for here). Make sure you don't have breakfast and don't plan to have dinner. Time and money well spent if you are looking for gluttony in good taste.
There are tons of buffets in Vegas but not all of them are good. This one is total jackpot, I did the breakfast buffet and I swear I just about tasted everything and it was high quality and great tasting food. 30 bucks well spent!
omg .. 4 days ago my friends and I went back to the bacchanal buffet at Caesars again , the food was to tasting and fesh so yummy , we love it  the service was excellen  next month we will coming back again . Good job guy. :-)))
During my most recent trip to Vegas, we decided to venture away from Wicked Spoon and try the Bacchanal Buffet after hearing countless good things about it. Immediately, I was impressed by the atmosphere and the layout of the buffet, which is crucial in being able to stay and indulge in as many of the offerings as possible!. . It's difficult to pick favorites, but one of the highlights is definitely the seafood. For the price you're paying, it's definitely most worthwhile to indulge in the crab legs, mussels, and shrimp. I was so thankful that the crab legs were conveniently sliced in the middle for easy access to the meat. The chicken and waffles was also a great pairing, with a huge piece of perfectly fried chicken and a slightly sweet crunchy waffle. There is a huge assortment of meats at the meat station, as well as a station designated for breakfast food, including french toast, red velvet pancakes, scrambled eggs, and bacon. The ethnic stations each had specialty dishes that were relatively authentic in my opinion. Some of my favorites were the risotto, the shrimp and grits, and the lobster biscuits and gravy. I was also surprised that the Asian food was actually good! I loved the shrimp har gao, as well as the ramen station that serves up made-to-order bowls of steaming hot ramen. . . The dessert station completely blew my mind, somehow thinking up every possible dessert that I could ever want, from classic apple pie and cheesecake to flan and crepes. There is sure to be something even for those of you without a sweet tooth, and definitely be sure to sample some of their unique ice cream flavors, like baklava and Mexican chocolate. . . Bacchanal truly lives up to its name, thinking up everything you could want in a buffet for an afternoon of gluttony and indulgence. Wear your loosest pants because you're going to want to have at least one of everything once you walk in!
Huge selection with lots of seafood and amazing desserts. . . Seafood: oysters, mussels, shrimp, cod... No crab when we were there unfort. . . Modern glass-filled upper scale ambiance, yet still casual enough. . . Overall you'll have a great time at this buffet!
Wonderful buffet inside Cesar's palace. The wait can be long so be prepared. Any level of players car higher than gold will get you in faster.. . Dim sum here is great. Sushi is not just your cookie cutter buffet sushi. I think the best items are from the grill. There's a huge selection of meats, prime rib, ribs, sausage, etc.
I came here for lunch while I was in vegas with some friends. I read about the long waiting time so we came around 11:30am and there was no line at all. The variety of food is great here although some things tasted straight up nasty. I loved the shrimp and grits, the dessert section was AMAZING, especially the green tea creme brulee, and their oysters were delicious. I would avoid the Chinese food and pizza sections because they were really bad. Overall, I had a good experience and a food induced coma.
Best Buffet in Vegas....hands down.   Is it more expensive? Yes.  Is it worth every penny? Absofreakinlutely!  While I love a buffet in general, nothing is worse than going to one, paying $25-35 and being unable to eat yourself stupid because the food just sucks.  That absolutely will not happen here. . . Pros:. . Shrimp and grits.  I've literally had dreams about this!. Peeled shrimp!  I really really hate having to peel shrimp.. Oysters on the half shell.  NomNomNom. Hot king crab legs. . Basically all of the food I tried was good to great. . .  Except for..... . The desserts. They were just alright.  Not bad, by any stretch of the imagination, but nothing to write home about either.. . Cons:. . OMG the line.  Ridiculous.  Try and go around late lunch or EARLY in the AM.  I refuse to pay any more to eat an already expensive meal.  This is the only reason why I didnt give it 5 stars.  Where it is located, Caesars could totally expand it to include more dining room if they wished...but they dont.
I will certainly say this is one of the better buffets that Vegas has to offer so it certainly is worth the price tag that comes along with it, but they do discount with the total rewards so that's always a plus! I only marked it 4 stars for the simple fact that the quality of the food was inconsistent.. . It did take quite a bit from paying to the time we sat which had me a bit disgruntled, but I'm certainly not going to ding any points for that. The layout itself is quite massive. There are literally stations everywhere and just when you think it's done there are.....You guessed it.....MORE STATIONS!. . I tried to sample anything and everything that looked appealing, but still found myself hovering around the seafood station and slider areas. I was a fan of the shrimp as it was both soft and did have some great flavor to it. The hit seemed to be the kobe slider, but for me it hit a sore spot. The first one I had showed me why I waited forever as it was moist and tasted like I hit a jackpot in my mouth, but the second time around all I could taste was char and couldn't eat another bite. . . As I said it certainly pays off well beyond the price tag if done the right way. There is great selection and I'm certain something for everyone. The etiquette of the people in line could use an improvement, but that certainly is not the fault of the staff nor Caesar himself.
Among the best buffets that I have had in Vegas. Very close to Wynn and Cosmo. The seafood of both snow and Alaskan crab was awesome, service was great, shrimp was huge. Yes it is expensive, pay the extra money! I went to sister property Rio or the seafood buffet the same weekend and it was similar in price and was absolute garbage.
We went for lunch and were disappointing with the selection based on what I had seen online for dinner. I know it was cheaper, but it felt as though it was a half effort at lunch time. Overall the quality of the food was way above average buffets, but some dishes were much better than others. The sliders, cheese selection, tiny plated salads/vegetables, and tacos were stand out items at the buffet. The sushi was decent too as well as the meat station. There was a lot missing from the seafood section at lunch time so if you are a seafood fan do NOT go for lunch.. . The desserts were nicely displayed, but it was a mixed bag in terms of flavor. The strawberry cheesecake pops were amazing and the green tea creme brulee was creative, but the red velvet whoopie pie was flavorless. . . Although I enjoyed the lack of a crowd during lunch time at Bacchanal, your money may be better spent at dinner, when I assume they put in more effort.
The hot crab legs are to die for! So delicious!!! . . Came here on a Wednesday night around 8pm. No line (thank goodness)! Last time we came, the line was wrapped around, and the wait was about 2 hours! The cost was about $50/ person. I thought that was pretty reasonable considering the amount of variety there was. In Hawaii, you'll easily pay $50 for a buffet that doesn't have half the choices of food. Our waiter was very friendly and always made sure our drinks were filled. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our meal here.
Booofay is a hit or miss, for me!  So far, i only love one spot (buffet at the Aria). But Bacchanal is not bad either, Saturday was about $48 pp. There's a whole lot of choices and presentations are top notched. Great variety of cuisines. The lines (at 12pm) wasn't deadly but it was 45min to get seated so, grab a drink at the bar situated right outside the buffet. 4star is for our awesome male server, endless champagne pour and cleaned our plates everytime we got up. The place is huge so grab two or three plates at a time =) Crab legs were a bit too salty, only complained (still i had four plates by myself)
Delicious! $80 for 2. When we got there at 1050 on monday, they were just finishing up breakfast so we sampled both breakfast and lunch. Less than 20 minute wait. One complaint was they cleared our table once and gave it to another group of diners before we were done. Same thing happened to a couple next to us. They had to reseat us.
By far the best buffet I have ever eaten at. If you are a seafood lover, go here. They have everything from oysters to shrimp cocktails to crab legs. For non seafood fanatics there's just about everything here: pizza, dim sum, pho, sushi, you name it, they probably have it. Their dessert section is AMAZING. By the time desserts came around, I was so full I didn't get a chance to try everything. They have macarons, crepes, gelato, strawberry dipped strawberries, beignets and so much more. My favorite parts were the oysters and the desserts. They also have really cool juice bottles you can pick up which range from strawberry to guava and they even have horchata!. . My only complaint is it's a little pricey. It's almost $60 before tip but hey it's Vegas and you're eating at one of the best buffets there. There's usually a 2 hour or so wait but they have a system now where they text you so just head over to the Forum Shops or gamble during that time.
I have tried almost every buffet on the strip.. . Decided to take the hit and paid $50 for dinner.. . Bacchanal is definitely the best on the strip.  They have everything and their Asian food is actually very good!  Jumbo shrimp, king crab, tiny lobster, sushi that is not full of rice, noodle soup that actually tastes very good, very delicious dessert, etc.. . They even take a picture of you before you enter like it's an attraction.. . BUT I can't recommend it at $50.  The value is just not there.  You will be just as happy at the Wicked Spoon or the Wynn buffet or the Bellagio buffet for 20%+ less.. . You'll be busy trying to get your moneys worth.  The people around me were done eating, but it seemed like they were waiting to digest so they can fit in more.  The receipt states to "please limit your stay to 2 hours". . The restroom is to the right of the exit and yes, you can re-enter after you unload.. . Your friends will be excited to go, but won't talk about how good it was.  They'll just talk about how they went to this $50 experience.  Ask them which food item specifically was better than other buffets?
A wide variety of food. The dim sum is ehhh.. I'm a big fan of the desserts and crab legs though. I prefer Wicked spoon, but the desserts are better over here.
After 90 minutes wait on Saturday afternoon for this restaurant, I have to say I was pretty disappointed. They do have a pretty good selection, the food was just so so and  not as delicate for 45$ per person.
Huge selection of fresh, tasty food. A decent meal of crab, sushi, shrimp, lamb, beef, etc. would easily cost this much per person anywhere in Vegas, and you wouldn't have the huge selection. The only down side was the desert bar. I find the desert bar at the Wicked Spoon to be more impressive.
This is the best buffet in Las Vegas.  The food is top notch quality and is always fresh!!!  While here the oysters were the plumpest I've had in a long time!  The oyster shooters were off the wall good.  Crab legs were great and cut in half making it easier to get too.... I like snapping my own in half but their way works OK.   Dessert island is awesome.  Everything I tried tasted wonderful!!! The atmosphere and seating makes you feel like you're in a high end place.  Worth the price of entry
I've been to several buffets in Vegas, and this time we chose Bacchanal based on all the great reviews we read. So the good - lots of variety to satisfy every type of eater. And the mushroom truffle soup and brussel sporuts were REALLY good. But that's about it.  Everything we had was lukewarm at best, and the service was rather slim. We saw our server once when she served our drinks, but she never came back to check on us. My sister had to get a refill on her water herself. But the most disappointing: the ceiling above the tables is a metal slat facade and you can see straight through to the ductwork.  Obviously it's never been cleaned because it was coated in thick layers of dust. $50 a person is too pricey to be barely mediocre!
I won't be able to summarize eaisly how great this buffet is. With the exception of price, this is by far the best buffet I've ever had the pleasure of dining in, in 50 years of life. Their wide variety of gourmet pleasures are vast to say the least. Their dessert are bar none the best I've ever seen offered at any buffet ever. I not only highly recommend, I suggest you forget wherever you where planning on going, and cone straight here, the best by far!
$50 per person so its pretty pricey... But food was GREAT! They served lamb (my fave) & they had mint jelly!! (Not all restaurants carry it idk why not). They make taco's as u order, had a mexican area, american, japanese. Chinese, cheese area, all diff kinda of soup not just the usual miso & clam chowder. Served crablegs that they cut in half already to make thing easier for everyone AND u have an option to have a steamed one. Desserts also wasnt just the usual - they actually had mochi here too! Just amazed me & my husband. Oh they also had tamarino, guava, horchata drinks. How cool is that?!. . Line was worth it!. Price was worth it!. . MUST TRY!!
$80 for 2 at lunch. It's Vegas so that's not my gripe. My problem was that there is almost nothing for my wife who is a vegetarian. Otherwise the food was above other buffets. Each item that I ate tastes like it was from a restaurant and not a mass produced Buffett. Desserts were awesome as well. May not come back because my wife can't eat anything here.
Went here on a Friday me and my girls were trying to come for breakfast but due to checking out and waking up late only made lunch. It was 38.99+ $10 for unlimited mimosas.( My best friend had never had a mimosa before so we need to change that pronto.) They food was great I stuffed myself full of meatballs and tacos and shrimp cocktail. The Prime rib was on point!!!! I was just disappointed I couldn't make enough room to enjoy all the desserts I wanted too but I did have the gelato which was delicious. I was bummed because they only make macaroons Saturday and Sunday but everything else definitely made up for that. I will definitely come back when I go to Vegas in a few months!
This Las Vegas buffet is permeated with familiar comfort foodsprepared in the freshest manner exploiting the finest ingredients. With more than 500+ dishes to choose from daily, every guest is sure to satiate their immense craving at Bacchanal, whether it's one for prime rib, chilled king crab legs that are already cut for you, grilled lamb chop, made to order tacos, and baked-to-order pastries. . . It represented the decadence of a Roman feast set within a fine dining atmosphere. Super chic environment with Sparta theme surrounded by the Greek goddesses or Roman emperors for a huge feast. I've been to Wicked Spoon, The Carnival Buffet, Wynn Buffet, and many others in Las Vegas. This one didn't impress me to an extend. I had super high expectation but it didn't exceed it. I guess all the hype isn't just a bluff. I will have to pass on this one but this deserves 4 stars.
My sister and I have tried a new buffet during our annual trips to Vegas (Mandalay, Wynn, and Paris previously) and this is my favorite so far.  We actually went twice (brunch and lunch on two different days) because we stayed at Caesars, it was convenient, and satisfied all our cravings.  Highlights-salad bar, meats and cheeses, pizza, sushi, and all the American offerings.  May have been the best biscuits and gravy ever.  Yummy fired chicken.  The desserts at lunch and sweets at breakfast were outstanding too.  My only criticism is lack of offerings at the Mexican station, I love Mexican and couldn't find anything that appealed to me.
Last year were much better, more king crabs, this year not so much, and it is $5 more now! However, i love the desserts bar, must try the pandan tiramisu cake with 24k gold leaf!

As far as buffets goes, this is the best I have ever experienced. I am someone who cannot stand buffets because of the germs that often comes with the name. However, Bacchanal Buffet is the exception. The restaurant was extremely clean as they staff constantly wiping down counters and tables as well as changing out old pans including serving utensils. . . I dined here back in March of 2014 when I was in Vegas for vacation. Because my boyfriend is a platinum member on some Vegas deal he has, we were able to skip the long line ( GREAT bonus) and be seated right away. We had a server who came and took drink orders and we were on our way to feast on great food!. . The buffet is gigantic. It's almost overwhelmingly large to where you don't know where to start. They have different "stations" offering a variety of food from salad bars, to BBQ, Italian, American, Asian, seafood, and so on. Because the buffet is so large, there were stations I missed completely because I never got around to visiting every station. .  The best buffet to me was the dessert bar. Wow! Every dessert your heart desires they just about had. . . They are expensive $50. However, the meal ended up being free for us because my boyfriend had over $400 worth of pts to use at restaurants so the cost didn't "hurt" us. But even if we did had to pay out of pocket, it would have been worth every dollar. The food, the service, the atmosphere all were considered when dining here.. . I cannot wait to get back to Vegas so I can go back. You will not find a better buffet than Bacchanal Buffet.
On my recent trip to Vegas, the family and I decided to head over to Bacchanal before going to Red Rock Canyon for breakfast. We went at 9:30AM on a Sunday and just as I had predicted, there were no lines. $50.00 per person and since it was my second time going to Bacchanal, I was over it. . . Bacchanal is a whole smorgasbord of dishes you can find anywhere in this world. It was breakfast but they were serving wings, crab legs and more! They have a lot of comfort food and Bacchanal just adds a little more spizazz to it. Your normal fries gets the extra parmesan and truffle on top. Your regular chicken wings have a buffalo with blue cheese and I-forgot-which-herb on it. I'm guessing you get the point now.. . The extra touches that they add to completely "normal" food makes it worth your while though. I personally loved their fries (yes, I had fries at 9 in the morning. Don't judge me) and dimsum section. Along with that, I can't really complain about having to pay $50.00 either, their selection is vast and the majority are absolutely tasty.. . We left at around 11 a.m and the line was starting to pile up. So if you're the type who doesn't like to wait, try waking up a wee bit early to avoid lines!
Vegas truly offers some of the most extravagant buffet in the world.. . We came here for Saturday brunch ($44.99 + tax - $1 discount with Total Rewards card). Unlike other Vegas buffets where you stand and wait in line, you first walk up to one of the kiosk machines and input your name, phone number, and party size. Once Bacchanal has an available spot for your party, you will receive a text and ask you to check-in and pay at the cashier within 15 minutes. The estimated waiting was supposedly 70 minutes, but we only waited for 30 minutes. . . Honestly, this whole place did feel like a mini food heaven. You can find dim sum in the Chinese section, prime rib in the meat section, pre-cut crab legs in seafood section, a juice bar with freshly made fruit / vegetable juices, and many more. . . Plate 1: BBQ pork, roasted duck, sushi, sashimi, dim sum (har gow, shumai), beef chow fun: For a buffet, all Chinese and Japanese food tasted pretty much hit the spot. Just don't expect these food to be five-star quality.. . Plate 2: Fried chicken, smoked brisket, bone-in prime rib, sweet potato tots, Wagyu beef sliders: I thought sweet potato tots was pretty unique and Wagyu beef sliders was definitely a highlight. Unfortunately, prime rib and fried chicken were average at best. The prime rib at Wynn Buffet tasted so much better. . . Plate 3: mussels, oysters, crab legs, chef special (mushroom polenta), sauteed mushrooms: Pre-sliced FRESH crab legs? Fresh mussels and oysters? This must be a seafood heaven! . . Plate 4: creme brulee, egg tart, almond cookie, green tea cookie with azuki beans, pecan sticky buns: Other than pecan sticky buns, everything else tasted amazing. That creme brulee ... I can eat that thing 3 times a day. . . Gelato (Thai tea + red bean flavors) and horchata: One of the best gelato I've had, but it melt so quickly =(. Oh and horchata is a must try - sooooo good. . . Main takeaway: Wynn Buffet has better prime ribs and Bacchanal Buffet has better desserts (and horchata). Not a perfect buffet, but you definitely get what you pay for.
The seafood section here will amaze you in every single aspect. Snow crab legs are already cut in half for your convenience, you can taste real tomato and celery in their oyster shooters and every type of seafood here is very fresh. The sushi bar could be a bit better by adding hand rolls or more options of Japanese food. Dinner here is about $60 but it's well worth it. The dessert bar is my favorite part of this buffet. They have a variety of desserts from mochi ice-cream to macaroons. I was totally surprised by their cake pop! ITS REALLY GOOD. If you come for dinner,the estimated waiting time is around 60~80minutes. Service is average unless you are a total reward diamond member, they'll literally come check on you every 5-10minutes. I really like the atmosphere here. Overall, it was a great dining experience.
If I were to describe this place with five words, it would be, OH THIS IS THE BEST. . . Hands down, best buffet on the strip, in my opinion.Yes, I do remember the snake-like queue line to the cashier. But for those hungry monsters who can't wait anymore, there's an "Express Line". Remember the Express Lines in Universal Studio? Yes, with a little more fee, you can get into the Bacchanal Heaven in a second. But my girlfriend and I were broke then, so we stood in line. I think we waited around forty five minutes to an hour and it wasn't at peak season. Do your math. . . It was dinner when we were here and they have a magnificent array of food. High-quality buffet, and not just mere bunch of food thrown around in metal baskets. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Worth the price and the wait.
Five stars for the environment. It makes me just want to sit there and chat with friend even if I am not eating anymore. . . Three stars for the food. Most of the food looked very appetizing, until you eat it.. I got five cold crab legs, three of them are way too salty that I couldn't eat them. . BBQ rib needs a little bit more time. Fresh oyster did not taste too fresh and was a little sandy. . Must try - the oxtail soup - five stars. . Also, their Asian food were not bad either. They even had ramen!. . For $50, I don't know if I should come back again...
Meh - it wasn't that impressive. I would have rather paid $700 for 5 star service than being in a cattle line.  The food was nothing to write home about.. We had to stand in line for over 2 hours, only to have our party split into 2 groups and placed separately. I might go back, but not during dinner on a weekend. No, they don't take reservations.
Arrived on a Tuesday night at 7:00 and only had about a 45 minute wait.  This was our second visit since it opened and was glad to see that they have strived to uphold the quality of execution.  All the flavors were amazing.  Some standouts were the lamb chops, prime rib, sushi, oysters and kobe sliders.  . . Their dessert station was amazing as the wife and I indulged in endless amounts of creme brule, macaroons, chocolate covered strawberries and much more.  . . Plates were regularly being cleared and drinks constantly being refilled.  We will definitely be  again in the future.
My first time! Came with my parents to foot the bill haha. I have had all the nice buffets: Bellagio, Wynn, Wicked Spoon, and other lesser ones like the Mirage and Rio. Bellagio used to be my favorite but I think Bacchanal has surpassed it. Each buffet has its signature qualities like the Wynn is known for desserts, Bellagio for seafood. Bacchanal had an amazing gourmet selection of all kinds of foods, everything was meticulously prepared and presented. . . Pros:. Seafood was fresh, esp the oysters and the king crab legs. Ceviche could use some work though.. The Mexican drinks at the Mexican bar!. The LAMB LEG was SO GOODD. Chocolate filled Beignets (I took the last one and it was like 9pm...) . Gelato selection! Even mochi ice cream!. Lava cake was actually lava. But they don't serve it in ramekins anymore.... Brussels sprouts!. Veggie cup. Cold cut selection!. . Cons:. Everything beef. The prime rib was dry and unjuicy. The wagyu beef burger was blech, with a terrible dried bun. The meatball was cold and blah. . . It is expensive, but the selection and quality of the food makes up for it compared to the other buffets.
AH. I love Bacchanal so much, I seriously dream about it every day. I honestly can't wait until the day I go back to eat it again. I'm really skeptical about buffets and have tried quite a few in my lifetime, but I must say, Bacchanal is THE best and it seriously surpassed my expectations.. . Gone here twice -- one time for lunch and the other time for dinner and both were amazing experiences. I know the wait can get super long (like an hour), but the two times I went, I only waited about 5-15 minutes max (came around 1 p.m. for lunch and 8 p.m. for dinner).. . So what I love about Bacchanal is the effort they put into the plating (especially the dessert) and that the food is made and tastes FRESH. Most buffets just leave the food sitting for a few hours, but the food at Bacchanal is prepared and made right in front of you. The selections are endless! From seafood to meat to Mexican to Asian, they have it all so you'll definitely find a few thing that you'll love here (tacos, AHHH). Not only do they put in effort when it comes to making and preparing the food, but they also put in effort when it comes to the decor.. . If you're gonna splurge in Vegas, definitely go to Bacchanal -- you will NOT be disappointed, I promise!
Bacchanal is pretty pricey and the food/selections are just okay. It's $50 per person, $10 more than wicked spoon but the only thing that sets Bacchanal apart is that it offers raw (albeit non-fresh) oysters. . . Pros:. (+) Sweet potato tater tots: Best thing at the buffet, IMO. . (+) Prime rib: pretty tender and flavorful. . (+) Lamb. (+) Macarons. (+) Noodle soup station: they made me some pho that wasn't half bad.. . Cons:. (-) Oysters: not fresh at all, mushy, and each oyster had bits of shell in them. Ugh. So annoying.. (-) Crab legs: dry and not fresh either.. (-) Sushi: spicy tuna was super dry and I would not trust any of that raw salmon.. (-) Asian food: none of it tasted very good. . (-) Chocolate covered strawberries: tasted good until I lifted my plate and saw TINY BUGS crawling all over it. Can't believe that would happen at a 'gourmet' buffet.
The Bacchanal Buffet has gone down hill. We had a group of 30 people come in for brunch on a Sunday. Problem? Yes. There was no brunch food. How can you call yourself a brunch and not have any breakfast food? No eggs, waffles, bacon, or pancakes. Don't get me wrong, I like burgers, but not at 10 am with a mimosas.  . . My suggestion is: if you are looking for a solid brunch buffett, if go elsewhere. Disappointing.
Bacchanal Buffet vs. Wicked Spoon @ Cosmopolitan. . . If this was a Vegas fight than it would be a KO in round . The champ is Bacchanal. . . I had the opportunity to dine at both buffets and my personal opinion is that Bacchanal is designed with the utmost attention to detail in its looks and culinary offerings. The aroma of food was fantastic and awakening to my senses. I made sure I came here on an empty stomach with a mean appetite, and it was well worth it.  The Buffet has an extravagant selection of food to choose from, and everything is presented very well. The selections are quite creative as well in contrast to most standard run-of-the-mill buffets. . . For $55/person, it's not the cheapest (i.e. Wicked Spoon). Nevertheless, the premium price for dinner was definitely worth the money to enjoy this amazing dining experience especially if you're a fan of seafood.
The rush hour at the seafood station is comparable to LA traffic. The very fast and upbeat music they play at the seafood station sorta helps get the line going.  It tests your patience to the maximum. You'll end up grabbing finger foods to keep yourself occupied (I grabbed an awesome basket of sweet potato totters) - definitely did not feel guilty munching in line because the guy in front of me was full on enjoying his delicious cut of lamb chop. At least I remember my sanitary rules and did not lick my fingers even though it was so finger-lickin-good. I also mastered the art of eating in line discretely. It was a very proud moment, felt like a kid who got away with eating cookies right before dinner.. . Everyone was so nice. From the nice lady who took our money as quick as Uncle Sam to the awesome chef who served us plates after plates of meat. I recall the gentleman in front of me who asked if he could have 3 lamb chops. The chef gave him the biggest smile and gave him 5! Now, that's excellent service. . . This place makes you feel very comfortable asking for a full rack of lamb or ribs. Only people who will make you feel uncomfortable will be the hungry humans behind you.. . I need the recipe for the delicious truffle scalloped potato they make here, it's so good. . . I will make you feel miserable and uncomfortable if you take all the fresh oysters and not leave me with at least 12 to grab. Blame it on LA traffic, the waiting game turnsyou into one of Disney's most celebrated villains, Maleficent.
Love love love this place! its soo HUGE. with all kinds of food ! . Came here with a group of 6 ladies on a saturday lunch. The cost was an about like $46.99 something like that. It was champagne lunch thats why the price was so high. . . When we were being seated, we walked passed the meat section and the man, who was big and built, that was serving the meat saw me and my group and yelled "LADIES! WELCOME TO BUCCHANAL!" haha it was so EPIC and awesome hes voice sounded like those warrior type hahaha . . We were seated in the way back of the buffet with a big around table with plush tall yellow seats! so pretty!. . I feel like they EVERYTHING. The meat section from your choosing of sausage, ham, steak, etc, noodle soup station, dim dum, sushi rolls /nigiri/ sashimi, crab legs, cheese & bread, and so on you get the point!. . Desert is on point! Macaroons, gellato, cookies, cakes, cupcakes, you can make your own cookie ice cream sandwiches!. . Im going to vegas at the end of June and i am def coming here for lunch but on the weekdays when its a lil cheaper!
For $50, this buffet is a must. Going in as a vegetarian I did not expect much but was happily surprised at the selection there was to offer.. . Some of my favorites were the frittata, congee with thousand year old duck and pickles, mushroom risotto, guacamole, waffles, mac and cheese, sauteed noodles, roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, couscous, and dolmas just to name a few.. . Don't forget the dessert island separate from the salty items.. . Will be back!
Like everyone has said. Best buffet on the strip. Service top notch. Yes it's pricey but you do get what you pay for. . Excellent meat selection hell excellent selection of everything really. Most every review mentioned the peach green tea. So I thought I'd try that. It was very thirst Quenching..... I had 4 of them. They have steamed and cold crab. I prefer the steamed. It takes a while to get but worth the wait. . I would send anyone I knew here to the bacchanal it's worth every penny. Enjoy
Well...originally when it opened it was $48, than $52 and now it's $62 per person! Is it worth it? Well it has crab legs, crab claws (although it was somewhat cracked it's still very difficult to open it to get the meat out). It has a array of meats and different options than your traditional vegas buffets. So if you're already in Vegas, why not splurge on a good meal you'll probably leave it at the tables anyway! Happy eating!
Bacchus was the god of wine and hedonism, and a bacchanal  was an over-the-top hedonistic experience; almost an orgy. So I expected a lavish, high quality buffet at the Bacchanal at Caesars...not so...instead, I found it to be overpriced, with so so food offerings! Go to Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan! Less expensive and far superior to what the Bacchanal has to offer.. . Loved the kiosk check-in and follow-up text to pay the cashier. A wise move on the part of Caesars and allows patrons to gamble or be otherwise occupied instead of waiting in line.. . After paying the cashier, we were ushered to the photo line...not sure why anyone would want their photo taken while waiting for the buffet, but ok.... . We tipped ahead of time, and our server commented on that, and thanked us. She was pleasant enough and very harried; looked like the restaurant was understaffed. We kept piling our dirty dishes on the side of the table, and it wasn't until we were on our dessert course that she started to pick up a few dishes. Again, really?. . The restaurant looks old and tired....the carpet and chairs are stained...definitely not what I'd expect from an expensive restaurant.. . We were seated near the seafood station, which made for great entertainment! There was a run on crab legs the entire time, with many patrons piling their plates high with crustacean limbs. I guess no one ever told them that they could go back as many times as they wanted...it was hilarious indeed to watch people juggling multiple plates of food.... . Now to the actual food offerings.... . The salad bar was ok, but nothing to write home about. I did enjoy the individually plated red and yellow beet salad. . . The overrated seafood station was exactly that...overrated. If you're not used to good food, then this will work for you. The ingredients were fine, but the overall experience was run of the mill; not what I'd expect from an expensive, highly rated establishment.. . The Asian and Mexican stations were predictable and ok. The pad thai and thai curry chicken were good. The refried beans were very flavorful but the street tacos were meh.... . The meat station was ok. I grabbed a bacchanal spud, expecting a loaded baked potato - sour cream and bacon. Well, it had shredded beef in it too...was not expecting that, and was not impressed.. . Dessert was nothing exciting either...I tried the blood orange sorbet so I could compare it to the one at Wicked Spoon. The Bacchanal version was overly sweet...the chocolate oreo mousse was ok.. . So don't waste your time here. For a richer dining experience, with quality food, an exquisite ambience, and top-notch service, go elsewhere...
Horrible Horrible Line!  Worse than Disneyland!  Food is great but after waiting for so long, who cares about the food.  If you're diabetic, you might pass out before you get seated and don't be fooled by your ticket time.  There's more waiting after that.  Go to M Resort instead!
Buyer beware!!  The "automated seating system queue" is not an automated system at all!  Plan to wait 1 1/2 hours past your wait time.  . . They do not cut off the line at any point, so you will continue to wait in the "to be seated" line after you pay.  This is absolutely ridiculous!  In addition, if you pay the $20 extra per person fee to be seated "immediately", you still have to wait in the 1 1/2 hour "to be seated" line.  . . What a joke!  They capture you at the hotel so that you have no option but to stay and wait it out.  Won't be back.
After considering high review, we thought to give it a try. The food were so-so. With the price of $52+tax: no lobster, limited selection of seafood (crab, mussel, shrimp),!salty Asian food, steaks, very good selection of dessert (gotta try Creme brulee). Drinks are served free, best is peach tea, then tropicaldrinks which were served in cute glass bottle. The ambience is great though. It makes you feel like dining at high end restaurant. All in all, i don't think it's worth it for seafood lovers.
We ate during dinner on May 19th. HORRIBLE food!!! I had some cocktail shrimp and oyster...I could not even eat it from the spoiling by the minute smell. I have had some great Oysters in Louisiana so I know how they should taste like. Then the dim sum...OH MY OH MY! The hacao was so mushy and the inside was powdery. The pad thai was dry. The only thing decent was the hummus, pita, and tabbouleh. The macaroons were decent as well as the cheese cake. My prime rib was alright but my husband got a slice that was very chewy. I would not pay more than $19 for this buffet. Go to Bellagio's Buffet instead. This place is not worth the money.
I've been here twice and this is probably my favorite Vegas buffet (Move over Wicked Spoon!!). Both times I came for lunch around 11am to avoid the long lines. Both times we got seated immediately and on our way out the line was probably an hour long! The variety they offer includes: Seafood, American, Pastas, Cheeses and Cured Meats, Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, and much more. . . My favorite items here are the Brisket and Prime Rib (both are cooked super tender and juicy), and Mussels and Oysters (fresh!), and their drinks (specially the Horchata). However, the star of the buffet is their dessert section! Tons of options for your sweet tooth from Creme Brulee, Gelato, Sorbets, Egg Tarts, Tiramisu, Crepe Station, and much much more!. . I even saw Metta World Peace here my last time! It is pricey, but worth it!
I'm sure you've heard it before and it's true, this is the BEST buffet in Vegas hands down! We come here EVERY time we're in Vegas or even just driving though.. . Yes its pricey but you get what you pay for. Yes the wait is sometimes long (I've actually never had to wait because our party is always over 8 and thats an automatic gratuity so they walk us right in) however, quality is worth the wait. Yes the service is top notch; one of my visits was on a Sunday for brunch which includes unlimited mimosas or champagne. Our server was so on point that she got me drunk and thats hard to do cuz i drink ALOT!!! . Yes I will be back over and over again! . No I don't have anything bad to say about Bacchanal :)
I love this place!!! MACARONS!! They have it only during dinner time and it actually taste good. This place is kind of like wooden spoon buffet, but better. The food is on little dishes as well. The food taste good though. . . There was so much food to pick him. I would have to say the crab leg was the best because i got mines hot right out of the pot. They have that option btw. the cold one is on the far left side and the hot one is towards the very end of the line. . . I will come back for sure.
One of the better buffets in vegas!. . I personally like this buffet more than the wynn, rio and its also on par with the bellagio buffet! The crab legs were amazing! The pho and ramen were also pretty  good! The pasta and the prime rib were also yummy! Even the tacos were pretty damn good! The desserts were okay in my opinion. We went for lunch so there were no macarons :( lame!
My first mistake was trying to eat here on Memorial day weekend. It was a mad house. The wait was 2.5 hours for dinner and it came at a hefty price $70 per person!. . Though once we got seated everything flow just like any other buffets. The food selection was plentiful. Everything tasted pretty good. My favorite part was the crepe station with made to order crepes.. . I'm not much of a buffet person so this was wasted on me really. I don't know about the best buffet in Vegas, that's hardly the truth.
So worth the money.  We ate for 3 hours it was so good and so many option's it was absolutely delicious no matter what you had and the service was superior.
We know why this place is rated so high. Hands down the best buffet joint in LV. Wicked Spoon and Belagio you are going to have to step up the game. Cool check in process that you enter your name and phone number on the kiosk and then will text message you to come pay when eating time gets close. This way you can wander around or play a couple hands. Trust me when I say it's better than standing around in a line like cattle..  Great selection of fresh seafood, meats and the dessert section is sweet! You'll have to see for yourselves all the food this place has to offer and the service we recieved was just over and beyond. Modern decor and a nice layout for you to move around. The only problem we had was trying to get our $50 worth. Going price for a top buffet joint on the strip but well worth the experience.
Fat kid heaven!!! So many choices it is overwhelming. My suggestion is to first do a full walk through to peruse all your options before committing to anything.. . Heard that they have a 24 hour pass you can purchase for something like $50 which is totally worth it! I'd probably start with dinner and then let it lap over into the next day trying to fit in as many meals as possible :). . . Oysters were fresh and delicious! And don't make the same mistake I did and fill up on fresh juice!
As a buffet regular, there are many parts that need to be rated for this type of dining. If rating were just on food, Ceasars would rate 5*,large selection, very good quality of many items for a buffet  So here's the rest of the story, Price is high. Cleanliness is good. Servers poor, there are few good ones, being generous you have a one in four chance of getting a good server, the other 3 have poor attitudes and ignore their tables,. Their rating would be 1.5, Cashiers poor, similar don't care attitude, rate them similar1.5. Management policy says all in your party must be present before anyone can be seated. It's a shame that such minor changes would make this a first class operation.
As with any buffet, things are hit and miss, and consistency is always an issue. Bacchanal, with its pricey $60ish dinner price per person, is no exception. The wait was also around an hour long for 3 people, and we came around 5-6pm.. . At first glance, I was really excited. Really deceptively huge space, lots of options, focus on more composed small plates. You even get cute rubber finger holders to hold the hot plates.. . Pros:. - Crab legs. The snow crab legs were really sweet and the way it's cut up allows for really easy eating. You can eat them either cold or hot.. - Mexican. Really surprised. The pozole was delicious. They do tacos (carne asada, pollo, and carnitas) to order on the plancha, and were smaller but delicious. Toppings include onions, salsa, and guac.. - Dessert. I was really impressed. Lot of options. There was a thai iced tea ice cream, red velvet yuzu whoopie pie, a platter of French macarons (though textural consistency issues were all across the board from soft to hard). - The brisket was pretty good.. . Cons:. - Asian food. The Chinese section had dim sum and some rice, noodles, and meat dishes. The shrimp dumpling skins were too thick, the stir fry chicken dish I tried a little of was inedible. The chicken had just been sitting out there under the heat lamps and turned into hard bricks. The Japanese food didn't have much either. The only decent thing was the noodle soup section.. - The mussels and oysters seemed quite dry and not fresh. It had a fishy smell and taste so that put me off.
This is by far the best buffet in Las Vegas and I have tried a lot of them. I only wish I could eat more at one time so that I could try more of their dishes. I haven't yet started bringing a ziplock bag with me in my giant purse to take home food for later, which I have seen some older ladies do at some local buffets. . . I really liked the potato truffle dish, the selection of cheeses and cold meats (prosciutto, salamis, etc.), and the various cake pops they had for dessert. My husband focused on the large selection of seafood and Asian dishes. He especially liked the shrimp risotto. He even ate two bowls of it. He said the flavor and texture were spot on. . . The quality of the food was excellent. You get what you pay for, but the price is about the same as what you would pay for the buffet at M Resort, Studio B. You get a better bang for your buck at Bacchanal.
Disappearing Selection - was not impressed on second go around.
Oh My Smorgy Heaven! There is soooo much fooooood here! All of it, every single bit was perfection! I was happily ashamed and disgusted with myself after eating myself silly. There really is something here for everyone. I am trying to think of a diet that couldn't be humored at Bacchanal and I'm not coming up with any.. . So it is expensive and you have to make a reservation at the kiosky thing. The day that I went, my party didn't think to call ahead and we were so sad to be told it was at least two hours wait...unless we paid an extra $20. I will admit, we paid it. It was worth it to get in right away and not mess up our whole day waiting around or skipping an epic-sized meal. . . I will be back, oh yes. I will be back.
Are you kidding me??????? $62.99 for a buffet!!!!! Enough said..... The buffet was wonderful, but not worth $69.99 a person.  Raising rates for Memorial day is shameful!! There are a lot of active and retired military families in Las Vegas.  Seems a bit harsh Caesar's
I heard this was the best buffet in Vegas so I had to check it out. I took a ticket for my party and came back when they called us 15 minutes later. The wait was not long at all.. . There's a lot of food here but not everything was quality.  Looks are deceiving. . . I tasted a lot of the Asian food items and they were either bland or way too salty.. . All I ate was king crab legs & oysters and that was worth the brunch price. These babies are normally expensive.. . After being a little hung over, the pho there was magical and soothed my body and soul. lol . . They have a ton of desserts. I liked the green tea creme brulee, red bean & thai ice tea gelato the best. . . I would come back for the same things again.
