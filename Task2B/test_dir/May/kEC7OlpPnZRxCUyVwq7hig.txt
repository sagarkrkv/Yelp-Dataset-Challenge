Wasn't too impressed by this hotel. It was expensive considering it was off the strip. . The tables were also higher limits than expected. . . The rooms looked old, and we had a suite. . The breakfast spot was great. Good food, and priced ok. . . The pool was solid. Cool area to people watch and hang out. They had sand pools, huge other pools too. Very nice place to hang out on a weekend day. It was not open at the time, but blackjack in the pool seemed cool
Suites are very nice looking, but wait.  NO refrigerator?  No coffee maker?  $7.50 for HRH Water in the room?  . . I understand hotels need to make money, but seriously, they can do away with some of the expensive Hard Rock eye candy downstairs and give each expensive "SUITE" a $10 coffee maker.  Geesh.. . By the way, telephone did not work, and instead of bringing me another, they tried to change batteries and wait for it to charge.  It still didn't work.  I arrived a bit early, but wasn't able to check in until after 4:00 pm.. . Spoke with the general manager.  His response without apologies, "would you like me to tell the engineer to replace the phone?"  I presumed that was a rhetorical question.  A simple "I'm sorry for your inconvenience would have sufficed."  I'm downgrading my rating from 3 to 2 stars.
Hotel rooms were super nice, But they took all of my money and I couldn't get over the fact they didn't have any Redbull!. . Very nice place, I'm happy I can now say I've been there. But I have experienced better.. . Bar:. Fresh off a flight from Detroit I arrive at the HRH around midnight. I'm greeted with a drink (Vodka & Monster) and plenty of handshakes from  a large group of fellow co-workers and friends. The drink was horrible, thinking maybe somebody was being cute and tainted my drink with a complimentary Vegas party favor I ordered another. Tasted equally as shitty. that was last drink I paid for there. . . HOTEL:. The room was awesome, great view from the Casino Tower facing North. You could see the pools below, and the northern end of the strip. Beverages that came in the fridge were a little over priced... but thats Vegas for ya.. . CASINO:. Every dollar I won on the strip I lost here at Hard Rock. I've never seen dealers pull the hands they were pulling. Nice big spread out floor, managed well. During the week it was down to only a few open tables. The weekend is when the place was rocking though! every table filled, mass groups of people checking in, checking out, coming and going from the concerts, and the line outside the club in there was crazy. . . POOL: We all went to the Paradise Beach North pool. Took a while for us to get organized in finding what we wanted. Place was busy and all of the good cabanas were taken (before 11am). Cabanas were expensive and the only ones available were away from the pool (away from the action). We finally found what was an oversized ottoman we rented for $500+ for the day. Drinks (Vodka & Monster) were around $36 a piece. The pool was frigid, but entertaining. Some of the most beautiful women in the world sun bathing. But there were some of the world's "people that shouldn't be in a bikini" there as well. All together we blew thousands there in drinks and from renting the ottoman/ couch.. . Bottomline: Bring a thick wallet and plenty of  KY
We received an upgrade due to overbooking at the hotel. The suite was aesthetically pleasing. However, the bathroom had a weird sewage smell and the shower water puddled at my feet even after calling maintenance. Everything was nice to look at in the room but definitely not as functional as it should be.
Stayed at the HRH in March 2014 for a weekend trip and was pleasantly surprised.. I personally prefer to stay on this strip, and this visit confirmed why--cabs lines are long, and cab rides can really add up and make a trip much more costly in the long run.. The HRH tower suites were very nicely appointed, if laid out a little strange. The bathroom was very spacious, but I thought it was strange that a glass wall separates it from the bedroom, with a curtain for privacy. Seems a bit cumbersome in lieu of just a solid wall, or a textured/matte/frosted glass wall.. The beds were very comfortable. A lot of noise from the nearby airport as well, but I didn't notice much.. Staff was hit or miss. Housekeeping was prompt and friendly, but asking anyone for directions on the ground/casino floor was very challenging.. The pool area is nice and well maintained, but very crowded and loud. Go figure since it is considered a "party pool"--not necessarily bad, just know what to expect.  The pool itself was REALLY cold on a mild weekend in March.. The price wasn't great, so I don't see myself staying here again unless a friend insisted or I got a great deal, but I enjoyed my weekend and wouldn't NOT recommend. Definitely try for the HRH tower if possible, as I heard all weekend the other rooms in the older towers aren't nearly as updated.
My friends and I decided to go on a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate a very special occasion. We decided to go on May long weekend (May 16 - 19, 2014) and stay at the Hard Rock. . . I booked my flight and hotel well in advance - in November, 2013. I booked through Expedia and paid in full for both my flights and my hotel room. I received a confirmation from the Hard Rock within minutes, saying that my booking had been accepted and my credit card payment had been processed. There was nothing left to do except continue to plan our event and get excited! . . However, things took a turn on May 3, 2014, when I received an e-mail from Expedia informing me that there 'may be' an 'urgent problem' with my room at the Hard Rock due to 'sudden, unforeseen circumstances.' Expedia asked me to contact a 1-800 number to deal with the problem. . .  I contacted this number immediately and was told that the hotel had 'overbooked' and that my room was no longer available. I tried to explain that I had already paid in full, over six months ago, for my room, and received a confirmation from the hotel, so I did not understand how this was happening at this time - not even two weeks before my scheduled departure date. I also tried to explain that I was going down with a group of people, who were all staying at the Hard Rock, for a special occasion. I did not want to move hotels. . . The woman at Expedia's Lodging Support Services was very cold. She simply told me that it was "...too bad..." and there was nothing she could do. She told me that I would have to "...come to terms with the fact that I must relocate..." and that I could not stay with my group at the Hard Rock. She told me that I should be happy that she was offering (what she deemed to be) comparable lodging at the 'South Point Inn', which is a small hotel WAY off the strip and in the desert. It goes for about $50.00 a night. Keep in mind that I had already paid more than double that - per night - for my room at the Hard Rock. I was obviously extremely upset. I ended up speaking to three different people at Expedia, who all told me the same thing. But I refused to give up.. . At that point, I decided to contact the Hard Rock directly. I was able to speak to the manager of reservations. He told me that there had been some kind of a mistake at the hotel and that it had accidently overbooked itself only a few days ago. I told him that I had already paid for my room, more than six months ago - in full!!!!!!! - and that I did not want to move hotels. Again, I got no answers and no apologies. The hotel seemed to be treating this like "...no big deal." I was told that a "....hotel is a hotel..." and I should just take whatever I had been given. No one seemed to care that I was travelling for a special occasion and that I had planned to stay in that hotel for that purpose and did not care to be separated from my group. I was just told "...to deal with it..." and I was brushed off. . . I am leaving for Vegas on May 16, 2014 - four days from now. I have still not received any further confirmation from the hotel. No one has contacted me and no one seems to care about me or my group or my event. I have never been treated so poorly by a hotel - or any business for that matter - before. I am absolutely shocked by what has happened and it has ruined the entire trip already - not just for me but also for my group. We feel like complete garbage. I just want what I rightfully paid for. But that seems like too much to ask for when it comes to the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.. . Bottom line - This hotel will just take your money and kick you to the curb.
The worst place to go if u are black & handicap. They want you to produce your birth certificate , handicap placard but that stays in the car so you can park in the handicap this has happen every time I've gone there.
This hotel is really cool for the younger group, I'd say 27 years and below.  I am thirty and I have to say that although its a great hotel, its not quite my style.. . The rooms are pretty good.  They are decorated very sexy but there were a few little things that could have used repair, such as the wall plugs were a little loose and rattley.  Be warned, they have vibrators and lube in the mini-bar, so if you have little kids, probably not the best.. . I definitely think that the pool brings in a younger crowd.  I didn't go to the pool, but there were so many guests there in their early twenties, clearly coming from the pool and highly intoxicated and loud that I think the hotel could do without. . . I do recommend eating at the Pink Taco inside the Hard Rock while you are there.  Very good Mexican Food.. . I think its a great hotel, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to people over thirty and definitely not to people bringing kids.  However, if you are in your twenties, this is the spot.  The guests that were there in the appropriate age range were having the time of their lives.. . If you are from out of town, which I assume most people in Vegas are, please note that this is not on the actual strip.  It is really close, but you will have to take a cab ride to and from.
I've stayed at the Hard Rock on several occasions for work. This last trip reminded why I despise it. . . It's not a terrible hotel, especially for a hotel that was originally conceived as a concert venue with some rooms, rather than a full-fledged resort. I've only stayed in the Paradise tower, where the rooms are nice, but nothing special. The overall decor theme (which was originally leopard print and purple) of grays and reds just feels dingy and dirty. I get that they're trying to channel a nightclub/rock lounge feel, but it gets old rather quickly. . . I find much of the clientele to be classless. The young, party-seeking crowd that the hotel and several of its venues (Rehab, Body English) attract seem to care less about little things like manners, decorum, and hygiene. Should you think that I'm an old fart with a bias against 20-somethings (Full disclosure: I'm 39), let me assure you that I'd be equally annoyed by bands of 50-year olds walking through the hallways shouting obscenities, starting drunken brawls and doing things like leaving a 40-foot trail of puke in their wake because they chose to vomit and walk and vomit and walk rather than stay outside and hurl in the bushes. . . Which leads me to the cleaning staff. While there are a few a exceptions, I find the crew at the Hard Rock to completely inept. Whether this is due to poor training, understaffing or horrible management, I cannot tell. . . Exhibit A: The aforementioned 40-foot trail of vomit took nearly an hour to be cleaned up. That was after the twenty minutes it took for a staff person to say, "we should probably get this cleaned up.". . Exhibit B: I stopped by my room at lunchtime on a Sunday, and noticed a discarded room service plate of chicken wings that my next-door neighbor had placed outside their door. They had obviously been in quite a rush, because wings were strewn across the hallway in front of their door. When I went to bed that night...the plate was still there. When I got up the next morning...it was STILL there. The last sighting was sometime after 10am Monday, probably an hour or so after some staff person saw it and thought, "we should probably get this cleaned up.". . Exhibit C: My room got passed over for cleaning one day. When I called down for service, three maids appeared to service the room (well done!). They made the bed, refreshed the towels...and then left the room with all of the trash and dirty glasses untouched. Oh well. One coworker performed an experiment by leaving her Do Not Disturb sign on the floor a few feet inside her room. It stayed there for 4 days. . . The Hard Rock does have a few redeeming qualities: Culinary Dropout and 35 Steaks, comfortable beds, and bars that serve well-poured drinks for decent prices. The convention staff was helpful and fun to work with work. And Pilot, the super-helpful security guy that went out if his way to make my friends feel welcome and cared for on a handful of occasions.. . I will probably end up staying at the hotel again for work, but I definitely won't choose it for a personal stay -- that is, until new management comes in and decides, "we should probably get this cleaned up."
The Hard Rock seems to have a lot of horrid reviews on here but my experience there didn't line up with a lot of what I'm seeing, so I feel compelled to put in my two cents.. Keep in mind, I only stayed one night, but I'm very picky. Very anal-retentive about cleanliness. and VERY intolerant of loud, drunken people carrying on and demanding attention from anyone that will give it to them. That being said, I didn't experience any problems with said possible grievances. . We booked the room for a night for only $70, which I think is great because I'm used to $150-$200 a night at shabby hotels in no name places Virginia. They placed a mandatory $50 security hold on my card but as soon as I checked out, the hold was immediately dropped so don't worry about that.. We got a free room up-grade and were facing the pool. Yeah, I didn't really care either. . The room itself was very clean and sleek. It had a sort of loungey vibe to it, everything was grey, black, and red. I was expecting your typical beige and green floral bull that every hotel seems to go with. The bathroom was a little small, but the shower was gargantuan.. The bed was by far the most comfortable bed I've ever sleeped on. I can't sleep in hotels. I'm always in pain, laying awake for 90% of the night and I get headaches from the slightest discomfort in any pillows. The second I laid down on this bed descended from the heavens themselves, I fell asleep within minutes and woke up in the morning pain-free. . The only cons is that there was no hair dryer. It's okay. I brought my own. But what if I hadn't? Just saying. You never know. Also, there's a LOT of walking if you're staying in the Paradise Towers. The casino and concierge seems like it takes forever to get to.. The hotel is a little far from the strip but still walkable. Maybe 3 blocks or so. It's a good deal if you don't care too much about being right where the action is but still not missing out on too much. HRH has it's own casino, nightclub, and some restaurants which I did not check out so I dunno how those are. . ALSO OUR ROOM HAD PICTURES OF THE CURE IN IT. AND THERE WAS TONS OF CLASH MEMORABILIA ON THE WALLS AND DURAN DURAN STUFF AND AND AND PLEASE LET THAT SINK IN.
Was extremely disappointed with the Hard Rock. I've stayed at the MGM and Palazzo but decided to do more of a lower budget trip this time. Turns out I should have splurged.. -all restaurants served overpriced poor quality food with even worse service. . -was given a room with dysfunctional shower and sink. -room service would not come until I had to call and complain and ask for an accommodation, in which they gave me some mini shampoos off of their housekeeping cart. Wonderful.. -asked concierge recommendations of some restaurants and she was very condescending. As if I asked her to do something that wasn't within her job description. . -guests were vomiting on the carpet of the casino . -was charged a $22/day service fee for a free shuttle that was not worth the use. . . Only positive: the beds. It sure was nice to sleep off all of the blood boiling this hotel had done.
Well nothing beats a nights sleep at HRH! The room has some beds that are pure heaven (goose down pillow/blanket). Room is well appointed and very comfortable and clean. Pool area is outstanding and large. Everything from swim up blackjack to your ever so adored lazy river. The casino is loud and bustling but thats why you're in Vegas......right?
Really pissed @ these people. I was @ a slot machine for 30 minutes and not one waitress  came by!! I was @ another one for about an hour and the waitress took 15 minutes @ least to come by each time. The drinks were small and I was done with them in 3 minutes!! They had guns & roses playing for an exorbitant amount of $$$. They advertised the heck out of that show but nowhere did I see that the Pretty Reckless were playing!!!!! I love that band, I would've totally gone to them but I had no idea they were there!!! I was so pissed!!!!!!!!!!! Hard Rock Hotel, you're the worst!!!
I visited on a weekday night, after a long hiking trip in the grand canyon. I surely felt out of place checking in wearing my dusty hiking gear and smelly clothes! There were beautiful people walking around in their bikinis-- the pool is a very popular place for sure! I loved that the beds were SO comfortable! We stayed in a corner suite in the paradise tower and it was so nice. The bathrooms are very well lit and the shower is massive. There is a hair dryer, it is in the closet in a little bag. . . We played black jack at the casino downstairs and minimum bet is $15. We had fun and even won a little money! We lounged at the pool the next morning and it was beautiful, relaxing and fantastic.. . The downside: everything is so expensive. over-priced! Although, it could just be vegas. But seriously, $35 for sunscreen? and $9 for skittles? skittles! come on! and $17 for a club sandwich and $45 for a veggie and hummus platter? There was no one at the pool and they wanted to charge us $500 for a cabana that no one was using. I could understand, maybe, on a weekend when there is a demand for that, but there were maybe 10 people in the entire pool. It was just plain ridiculous. Well, what do you expect, Vegas isn't really a "budget" vacation.
Great experience. I purchased an on line room for $43 (with resort fee and taxes, ended up being $70) but I felt like it was a total steal. The rooms are gorgeous, the pools are so relaxing (although we had a hard time finding chairs) and the bars are cool too. . . Me and my boo ate at culinary dropout which was soooo good. I love the Hard Rock brand. It's just really cool.
The pool is awesome, the shuttle service is not. My friend and I bought a groupon for here and they told us there was a shuttle to the strip until 3am BUT when we got here it turned out that the LAST shuttle goes at 5 pm. . . When we went we had to take a can which cost about 30 dollars. . . Restaurant wise, they have nobu, which is awesome if you win big. Otherwise I would recommend Culinary Dropout or Mr. Lucky's. They both have decent American fare.. . Tips: they won't let you bring a cooler, so be sneaky if you do and don't bring it out to the pool. There is no microwave, refrigerator or coffee makers in the rooms. They do have enough plugs if you want to bring your own, but that would be a hassle. If you want to drink by the pool, they won't let you drink your own. What we did was buy one drink and then fill it up with our own stuff back at the room.. . The club, body English, is only open Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. It says it opens at 1030, but they didn't let anyone in until after 11 and when it was our turn we left quickly. The music was nothing great and there were just people occupying the boths and it was very empty.. . I think I would check out the pool again but that's it.
