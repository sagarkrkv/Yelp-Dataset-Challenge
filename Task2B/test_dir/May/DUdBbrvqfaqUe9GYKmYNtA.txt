Spent some of our honeymoon at the mirage, and so glad we did! Love the semi-tropical vibe, and the room was clean and spacious! Staff and room service were great, and it's right on the strip in the middle of everything! They have a little convenience store in the hotel, which was useful, since we didn't bring any of our toiletries on the plane! Would definitely come back and stay here!
It's a very nice casino.  Everything looks perfect.  The tables are a little expensive though.  This isn't the Venetian!
I wish I could give it no stars. . . I had a good stay, but after leaving home. My credit card statement showed a charge that I did not authorized. I called them to ask why and what it was and they told me it was a mandatory resort fee. . . For the amount of money I paid to stay there and the amount of money I spent there. Why am I being charged more? . . When I called the hotel they were no help. I told then I wasn't informed about this mandatory fee in advance and they said it's on our paperwork. . . Terrible service. If there's a fee that's gonna be charged tell me ahead of time. Most of the time people don't read anything. . . It's a hassle and a waste of time for me to have to call and ask what it is. . . They didn't do anything to help.. . Terrible!!!!. . Btw. The rooms had no coffee maker, no bath robes, no shower cap. . . And they keep dolphins in captivity for entertainment purposes. You have to pay $15 dollars to see them. Many dolphins die here because it's not the right environment for them to live in.
I've been to Las Vegas 9-ish times.  My first trip out there was in 1999 and ever since I've been wanting to stay here.  FINALLY I did and it was everything I imagined plus some!. . For starters, sign up to receive emails because I booked with a promo - I want to say 20% off rates and a $25 room service credit.  I booked their Hospitality Suite for two friends and myself.  There is also AAA rates for members too.  I got a better rate doing it through the email promo.. . I will mention I'm NOT a fan of resort fees though once in a while I overlook it if I really want to stay at the place.  Unlike other hotels where the fee is optional...it is not here, at least we weren't told that it was.. . We arrived between 6 & 7pm and there was no wait - we walked right up and we were given excellent service right from the start...we also got bottles of water with our room keys.  Our Hospitality Suite was on the 4th floor - not the best view but a decent view and really, how much time does one admire their view while in Vegas, ok, a few minutes here and there so not at all a big deal!. . The room was clean and we got all kinds of decent size shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, etc.  I got a new loofah every day as well - I wish I didn't pack that stuff because everything I needed was there in the bathroom and refilled daily.    This suite was pretty amazing too...I felt like a princess getting ready in a bathroom that big!  . . The weather was in the 70s so there were people at the pool but it wasn't overcrowded where you couldn't find a chair.  The service at the pool was great, the grounds were clean, etc.. . The hotel itself has a lot of great options...we ate at BLT Burger, California Pizza Kitchen, Cravings, and Stack.  I did some chocolate shopping at the Sugar Factory, grabbed breakfast from the Roasted Bean, and Frozen Yogurt at Blizz so there are plenty of food options right on site and no need to leave and go elsewhere. There is a decent size gift shop that sells everything you need souvenir wise, if you forgot something at home, or if you want a snack and drink.. . One last thing...location, location, location.  This place is in a great place on the strip - a short walk to the Bellagio Fountains, The Linq, or to the fancier hotels like Palazzo, Wynn, or Encore.. . We were treated great here, everything was clean and just wonderful.. . To date, this has been the best place I've stayed in Vegas - I recommend it to anyone and would return.
Another year, another conference and another visit to The Mirage.. . I was expecting tired rooms, noise and nonsense checking in. On this occasion I was surprised when I discovered that I'd been booked into a Suite on the B floor rather than a standard room. I wasn't expecting much from a Suite at The Mirage but I was very happy with what I found. It was a 3 room suite, a large lounge and bar area, a large bedroom and a bathroom/dressing room. Very tastefully furnished and best of all very clean.. . It was a total experience upgrade - the Suite is so large that you can't hear anything from outside or the adjacent rooms.. . The only problem is the Wifi - it is simply unusable for anything other than sending the occasion e-mail. They really do need to increase their bandwidth significantly and justify charging that "resort fee".
My last trip to Vegas (July 2013) I got a super discount through M Life for a week at The Mirage (entire 6-day stay was under $400 including the annoying resort fee). I had a slightly better time at the hotel for this trip than I did for my previous trip at TI next door. The casino was much more lively and kinder to me and I fell in love with the NY style deli by the casino entrance. Ate there almost every lunch and a few dinners. Did not fool with the Beatles-themed Cirque show as I had already seen O at the Bellagio and Zumanity at NYNY. Did drink WAY too much one night while playing Let it Ride though LOL. My room was nicer this trip and housekeeping was good to me once again. Food choices were not bad. The Mirage is older and you can tell that when you walk in. It's really taken a beating over the years and the smoke smell in the casino is almost as bad as the MGM's casino. But it's still a good value and still a nice hotel. I'd probably stay there again if the price was right.
I love the Mirage! I stayed here the night of my 21st birthday, then 4 years later, I returned with my sister, brother, and husband for their 30th birthday. . . We stayed in a king suite, which was absolutely gorgeous. The bed was super comfy, full length mirrors, and a great radio with iPod/iPhone hookup, which is awesome. Like anywhere is Vegas, don't mess with the mini bar.... Outrageous prices. Go across the street to the liquor store and grab some water, liquor and snacks. . . The pool is awesome. I love the waterfalls and the big open concept bThey have multiple poolside bar and grilles, and tons of chairs. We laid out towels on front row  chairs early (around 8or 9 am?), and nobody messed with them. Tip the servers and they will not forget about you. They did not check our bags as we came in, so naturally, we brought in flasks and mixers. They have representatives from Bare (topless option adult pool) who annoy the heck out of you, but a firm NO, and they will back off. . . The casino is clean and nice, with $10 minimums on the tables during the day, with only one or two tables per game of 10 min in the evenings. We checked out Revolution (the Beatles lounge) for free and ladies got at least two free drinks. The Sports Bet is decent (per my husband), but drink servers are scarce. We got a $60 voucher to use at CPK for signing up for the M Life rewards card. Pretty sweet. . . Unfortunately, the room keys did not always work. My sister had to call the front desk at least 3 times throughout the weekend (sometimes after a long night!) and had to wait 10-20 minutes for a staff member to come open her door. Also, internet and cell  service sucks. Like really, really sucks. . . I would visit the Mirage again. Great location, nice and modern rooms, amazing pool scene and a legit casino level.
The corporation as a whole is a joke, they don't even care about their loyalty customer,s, bad rooms, horrible prices, this hotel is definitely a dinosaur in the industry. I won't be investing this company anytime. CEO should make a surprise visit just for sake of quality control. The last visit I will make to any M Life Hotel!!!
Okay so im here at the moment. The casino is great and food is wonderful. Right in the middle of strip next to Caesars. My complaint is that when we checked in at 1130 pm one room was not ready!  We had to wait for the room to be ready which was a pain. When I come back to VEGAS I will be trying another hotel. They did nothing to accommodate the fact that the rooms weren't ready at almost midnight meanwhile check out is at 11. Maybe if they offered a late check out or a discount or an upgrade would have been nice. After traveling for 9 hrs would of been nice to NOT have aggravation. Also the water in the bathroom gets so hot I burnt my hands. Dont even attempt to put the hot water on!
Stayed at the Mirage May 2-May 4 of 2014 and had a nice time, but it's not my favorite Vegas property.. Mirage's location cannot be beat--right in the middle of all the Strip action.. The casino seemed a little underwhelming but I won $30 at penny slots so I can't complain (I'm not a huge gambler).. I flew in later in the evening so my husband had checked us in, so I can't speak to the ease of check-in, but the lobby and all common areas of the resort are very well-appointed and well maintained. I really like the tropical oasis feeling and the kids we saw visiting sure seemed to as well.. The pool was gorgeous and well manicured, although I found the chairs were a bit too close together. The pool itself was chilly but it was welcome on a hot May day.. The rooms--very nice decor and clean. There is an iPod dock, a weird large chair/small loveseat that seems to fit 1.5 people, and plenty of storage. Very comfortable bed. We had a nice strip view that we enjoyed, and were not close to the volcano, so we didn't have any issues with noise. The windows actually open, which is nice to let in some fresh air, but ended up being a pain when it got windy.. The closet was in the bathroom, which I found a bit inconvenient, but we made it work. The bathroom was probably my least favorite part of the stay. Only one sink, which made it tough to get ready quickly, and not a whole lot of counter space. The tub was standard sized, but the shower curtain seemed to be set up weird because it was impossible to not drench the entire bathroom when using the shower. The shower water pressure left much to be desired but I don't expect much from massive hotels.. I really enjoyed the variety of restaurants at the hotel, and even took in a LA Kings playoff game at the Sports Book and met some nice other fans who shared their free drinks from betting with us. The crowd at Mirage seems to be a little older than the party/club crowd at some of the more happening resorts, but was still a mix of active nightlife type guests and older, relaxing-vacation/gambling guests, with some families mixed in. Something for everyone!. Given the right price, I would stay at Mirage again. Just bring fewer toiletries!
I'm in Vegas on a business trip and staying at the mirage. I'll preface with the fact that I work in this industry and very critical. . . First, my check in experience is not what I'm a accustom to and the front desk agents need more training. There were 4 agents....2 we're not doing anything, 1 seemed new (which is fine) as he was asking lots of questions, 1 was slow but the agent I received was turning and burning. However,  using abbreviated verbiage and slang. . . Once I got to the room, the glasses were dirty. The sheets were not tucked in all the way, the hangers were torn up. I could go on but overall it had great ambiance and quite inviting. There is a lot of purple in the room. . . I ordered room service and it took approximately 43 mins when they quoted 45 so right on time. . . We'll see how the rest of the stay is.
I always wanted to stay at the mirage.  Now I would rather stay at the Excalibur.  Only good thing to say is that LOVE is playing there.
Decent casino! Easy to navigate self-parking, awesome and gigantic aquarium behind the check in desk, line moved quickly. Garden area in lobby is nice, casino floor is organized and there is a lot of signage to find your way around.. . Sigfried & Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat looks amazing, but sadly they close at 6:30 with last admission at 5:30, which we just barely missed. Adult entry $15 seemed a little steep.. . Revolution Lounge is Beatles-themed and small with pricey drinks (as expected in Vegas). Stack restaurant has tasty small bites.. . Overall, casino has many dining and entertainment options and is well-located.
I love this hotel.. Very clean, not to big like the big hostels.. They have adult pool(topples....)and love show is the best!!!. Overall great vacation if you don't gamble!!!
My husband and I wed at the Mirage Pool Waterfall at 8:30PM on May 15th and it was absolutely beautiful (I'm a little bias, but we booked the location a year prior to our wedding so I wasn't sure what to expect) and exceeded my expectations. The wedding coordinator Christine was very attentive and quick to respond to emails. Since we don't live in NV this was our means of communication. I'm the type of person that prefers to select flowers, chairs, etc. from a few option more than 4 is too much pressure. At the Mirage you select all these things from a list of about 3, which is less stress. If you're looking for a destination venue with a beautiful back drop that will produce fab pics then you should consider this location. I would suggest this location for anyone who wants a nice wedding without the large price tag and not looking to go crazy. The venue is pretty affordable, however, we only had our ceremony because the price for the reception was outside of our price range (visit their website for prices and weekday's are cheaper).  If you have your ceremony at the Mirage they offer room discounts. . . If you do have your wedding at the Mirage and order the photography session make sure you take photos by the REVOLUTION sign as I guarantee they will be beautiful!. . We stayed on the 24th floor, the best thing about the room was the bathroom as it had two sinks, a huge mirror (great for getting ready), separate shower and tub. The housekeeping staff were awesome.  After our ceremony champagne was waiting for us in our room, this was a nice touch from our coordinator. We even used the laundry service to get my husband's suit steamed. We put a call in after the time frame and they accommodated our request and returned the suit back with ample time to spare.
This place is a bit better than okay. I ate at Samba while I stayed there. The food was not that great and neither was the service. The wait staff in the casino area is great.
The Mirage is excellent from the service all the way to the casino atmosphere!  The pool area is well above average
Oh Mirage. So many good memories. Super Bowl XLIII, the grand opening, room upgrades and more recently my bachlorette party. It's tropical themed. I've always loved their huge acquarium at the front desk. Can't beat the one at Golden Nugget's pool, but it'll do. Newest addition is a Kardashian store. Eh, whatevers. Not going to lie, but I miss the white tiger display :T. . -Gamble here. I rarely ever lose when I play. This is to say I only play a handfull of things like routlette, video poker and the occasional slots. It's kind of hard to secure a spot at the $15 Blackjack table- they're almost always full. . . -Location. Can't beat it! Within walking distance to Venetian, Ceasar's, Wynn, Treasure and Fashion Show mall. BTW- don't ask the taxi drivers to take you to Wynn. A lot of them get in a little hissy fit since it's so close. I mean, walkable when you're not sporting 5'' heels- you feel me? :X. . -Rooms. I finally got to stay at a large suite and was really impressed with the modern touches. It was so spacious!!! We had a one bedroom suite that connected to another room with a kitchenette. My only complaint would be that we could hear noises from the suite above us through one of our AC vents. The toiletries smell a lot better than what you get at other competing hotels too. A regular room is well worth the price. Comfy beds!. . -Bars & food. CPK, Carnegie, the buffet, BLT.. All pretty solid. The buffet's salad bar used to be my fav because they mix everything for you. . . -Gym. It's free and it's nice....
We really enjoyed our stay at the Mirage, the front desk check-in was smooth and we were able to get into our room early :)  The concierge was awesome in letting us change our VIP pool tickets to a different day as the weather in Vegas that day was "chilly".  The rooms were really comfy and the items in the Mini Fridge were perfect for me (but add more mixers like cranberry juice :) Thank you for a memorable stay!
I recently had a 3 night stay at the Mirage, and was for the most part impressed with the place.. . The valet service, especially, is prompt and courteous. Check-in lines can be quite long, however.. . The hotel has a couple of nice stores/restaurants inside. The buffet was nice, but somewhat overpriced for what you get compared to similarly priced buffets elsewhere on the strip, or at places like the M. .. . It's great that they have wi-fi everywhere, as slow as it maybe, and on the casino floor, the ventilation was pretty good at sucking up second hand smoke. . . I sprung for the room upgrade to the King tower rooms on 24-25. Except for the view, I can't really recommend justyfing the extra expense over the other rooms. They were still very small. Also irritating was the fact that all the electrical outlets were nowhere near the bedsides. Had to charge my devices on the desk in the corner, which is quite a hassle... . Room service and housekeeping were all great.. Prompt and courteous.. The hotel location is also really good with easy access to other resorts/shopping.
