Thoroughly enjoyed this show! With all the mixed reviews, I was a little worried! This cirque du soleil show is more interactive with the audience than the others. I think if you have an outgoing crowd the show will def be better! The audiences in my show were outgoing and made the show hilarious! The show was supposed to be sensual, but I didn't find anything sensual about it. A couple of the performances were amazing! Def recommended!!
Save your money and your time. Thisshow was horrible, no acrobatics, all you get is lame cheesy sex humor, there are many better 'adult' shows on the strip, I'd see jubilee again over this any day...and that's saying something.. . I previously caught Peepshow, for about half the price that was actually sensual and sexy. This was cheese, and more cheese. If they advertised the show as more of a comedy I may have felt it was worth the money, but advertising it as a sensual production when it's far from it?
I am a 21 year old female from Arizona and found this show hilarious!! For everyone being negative saying it is "raunchy" "trashy" and "tasteless" you need to grow up.  Yes there is vulgar language and sexual scenes HENCE why it's only for 18 and over.  I thought the actors and actresses did a great job! Yes there were boobs and butts throughout the entire show.. but I guess I'm just not one to be freaked out by the human body considering we all have one.  . I must say the audience interaction made the show!! I was within a very open minded go with the flow audience which made my experience great.  I enjoyed every minute of it! If you're afraid of "nipples" and "butt cheeks" stay away, but if you're the 80% that don't mind you'll have a blast!
Loved it. Overall a good combination of sexy, raunchy, and funny. It kept me super entrrtained and the husband of course loved the amount of boobies he saw ; ) I would have given it five stars if it was just a little longer!
Got a great deal on Vegas.com. Sat in the dead center just behind the sound control board. I've seen nearly every Cirque show in Vegas and decided to have a date night for my final night in Sin City and check this show out. It was unique - as all Cirque shows are. I would say it's more of a cabaret show than Cirque if I'm being honest. It's good, a little strange but there's some very interesting audience interaction that is worth a laugh or two. The reviews that said it made the viewers "randy" confused me. While this is the sexual side of Cirque, it wasn't enough to make us want to run back to the room. I suppose if 50 Shades of Grey does it for you this will too. Both were a little over-hyped on the "oh so sexual you must be done immediately" end of the spectrum for me. All in all - it's worth seeing, but don't go with your mom.
Just so-so.... We saw this show on 5/23/14. Had loveseat tickets that we paid a premium for, but they were to the left of the stage and near the back. Saw NOTHING going on at the back of the stage. When the show started, they forgot their mics, so we had no idea what was happening for the first 15 minutes....the music was loud but good... The acts weren't that impressive, other than the contortionist and the little man flying through the air. They could have kept the two fat girls.... Added nothing to the show... And the black girl only had African dancing skills? The audience participation was cute, but any of it that happened at the beginning was lost on us. If you get comped, take it... Otherwise,, save your money.... A drink was $13! Absinthe at Caesars was a better show.
