Oh how I missed this place since the last time I came.  This place gets busy quickly and lineups are down the sidewalk.  The smoked meat is amazing especially with the mustard.  Remember to down it with a cherry cola. Yummy. Till next time
Every time I visit Montreal I always make it a point to get a smoke meat sandwich here.  Still under $10 gets you a good sandwich was a good amount of meat.  And you can ask them to cut the meat just the way you like.
I am from NY. Well, I am from NJ, and work in NY. This is based on that.. . I like this place. The place is solid. It's a sort of hole in the wall full of tourists that are heeding the advice that "you must go here." Andy wanted me to try it, as she lived in Montreal for many years. She did not say that I must try it. But we were close, and it's kind of a well-known establishment in Montreal. So we went in. . . The place is old school, for sure. The vibe is totally New York, which I like. People are piled in at tables and slamming down millions of calories of food in a very blue collar setting. Totally enjoy the vibe of the place. We were squeezed in where they could fit us. People watching was ok, though it's a small joint and reading the stuff on the walls was just as entertaining. . . We got a sandwich. For me, this is pastrami from a Jewish deli. I know, I know. Everyone is going to say that no, it's different. To me, it tasted more or less the same as a real good pastrami. It's good, it's tasty, gooey, fatty, succulent, etc etc. I am not a big enough red meat fan to say that you absolutely must go here. It was good, the sandwich was good, the experience was good. But I think the hype is a little bit much. I read some of the reviews here and think that some people are out of their minds. Well, I guess I know that some people are out of their minds based on much more than that. But you get the point. . . If you are from the NY area and have eaten pastrami & corned beef all your life, don't go here. You will wonder what the fuss is all about. If that does not describe you, then you should go for it. It will be a really good, reasonably priced, down-to-earth eating experience that you will enjoy for sure. Unless you're a vegetarian. Then go toFairmount Bagels instead.
If Schwartz was an institution, I'd sign myself in voluntarily every single day!. . What can I say about this place that most of you don't already know?  It's a jewel of Montreal, arguably the best smoked meat in all of Canada if not the east side of the continent!. . Line ups are abound year round, especially during the summer and long weekends.  Here's a tip: don't go in large groups, go as a couple or threesome, it allows you to skip the line faster.  . . The smoked meat here is delicious, absolute heaven to taste into.  When you order your sandwich, ask for fatty meat for the most flavour, also order a side of coleslaw, pickles and a cherry pop to complete your Schwartz experience.. . But most of all, say hello to the patrons you'll be nestled in tightly with in the communal tables.  . . On your way out, be sure to stop next door to get a pound, or two to go!  I always do!. . This place is a must visit for every single visitor to Montreal because nowhere else does smoked meat like they do!
I love this place. I live in Vancouver and have travelled across most of Canada and been to Deli's in New York and I've yet to taste anything like this. This is the best smoked meat sandwich in North America.
Restaurant is rundown and dirty - there were crushed fries on the floor, mustard bottle was oily.  Smoked meat (even the lean cut) is way too fatty and greasy, we left huge chunks of fat in our plates. Bread was soggy from all the grease. That place is all hype and no substance. Finally, they have a "cash only" policy so they can squeeze an extra percent or two of profit out of the system. Won't be going back.
It's a must go... if you haven't been to Katz. Solid smoked meat joint with a very devote following (our waiter got upset when my friend mentioned that the placed had changed hands- which it had) would've liked some russian dressing and surprised no spicy mustard!
Marvelous Chocolate was amazed & surprised. Short of a long line :-) you've got wonder ahead. Come hungry.
Sandwiches were great!!!! We've decided to buy more before going back to Torotno! However, soft drinks are 1/4 of the price of sandwiches, not worth it. Long line up uhhhh we waited 20 mins at almost 10pm
This is a well-known establishment that has lots of fans and lovers. I get it, I've been to really good delis and this is better than OK. But I don't understand the hype and lore. It's a pretty good deli but...The smoked meats are good and you need to order yourcuts with fat in order to get a good sandwich. If you're in the neighborhood, check it out but I was a little disappointed.
extra fat is so amazing
A Montreal institution which I stumbled upon while walking around. I saw this huge line and regular patrons raved about this place...So we waited. It took about 45 min. Singles and tables for 2 were easier to get. I got the staple meat sandwich apparently medium was the way to have it prepared a black cherry soda and fries (tangy slaw and sour pickles-no half sours here). It is an old school place now owned by Celine Dion and the vibe is NY deli. The meat is smoked somewhere between corned beef and pastrami...but smoked. It was ok kind of dry and heavily smoked. I've had much better meat in many other deli's and there is no comparison to Katz's which is in a league all its own.  Also the sandwich comes with mustard without even asking which is not a problem for me just an FYI for you. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to return and certainly not wait 45 minutes for a table again.
A well-known place and worth it to line-up.  Their smoke meat really tasty and different Would love to have it everyday but I dont want to gain 60lbs in 1 week. haha..
It's famous for a reason!. . I agree with everyone else. DEFINITEly get the smoked meat sandwich and at least get the medium cut. For me, it was the perfect amount of fat to go along with the meat. Enough that you get bites of the melt-in-your-mouth taste and texture but not so much that it overpowers everything else.
If you are in Montreal and you love meat and you have never been here, you have to go! This place is soo good. Smoked meat sandwich or medium plate mmmmm. Without a doubt best smoked meat in montreal. Sandwich is loaded with half a pound and it's so filling for only 7$. Can't beat that. Especially the taste. They only take cash tho!
This place definitely lives up to its reputation! TIPS: For a party of 2 or more, rather than ordering individual sandwiches, we noticed that locals actually order a plate of meat which comes with lots of bread on the side. Ever since, we also do the same. You get more for what you pay for, and you can also decide how much meat you want in each half, open-faced sandwiches you make. It is also more fun to share the meat plate together anyway!
This is the real deal. It's delicious, it's well priced, it's a Montreal landmark, and you should come around 11-12 so you don't have to wait as long. The cole slaw was so different - refreshing. I made the mistake of sharing a sandwich with my friend - don't do this! You should eat as much as you can, because 2 hours later, you'll be wishing you had.
I ordered the requisite smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle and black cherry soda and wasn't disappointed.  Excellent in every way and under $20. Admittedly, there's probably a deli in your neighborhood that's just as good but that doesn't take away from Schwartz's greatness. . . Heads up:  Rather than wait in a line the size of Texas, you can instead enter the second door, pay upfront and carry your food to the rear counter.  It wasn't very clean back there but I saved A LOT of time avoiding that long queue...
