My husband and I had lunch here and really enjoyed it!  He is vegetarian, and got the butternut squash tortelli, which was really good and unique from the usual vegetarian offerings. I had the meatloaf, which was your basic meatloaf and mashed potatoes. The service was excellent and we would definitely come back again!
Overpriced food.  The dishes were cooked sloppy and wine was not impressive.  We had 2 different Pinot Noir by glass and they weren't all that.  The bread basket was dry.  The Dior sign across the restaurant is a total eye soar and ruins ambience.  I would not go here again.  Spend your money somewhere else and save the drama of the wait.  Our waitress was very nice.  They did special order a vegetarian primavera for me but papardelle was stuck together and it was too,salty
Food was fast, hot and very good. However waitress dropped the restaurants rating from 4 to 31/2. I like a nice glass of wine with my meal. By the time I got my glass of wine the waitress had to reheat my meal. Stay away from the blonde and you'll enjoy.
I was excited to try this place on vacation. However, was very disappointed! Service was so bad it ruined the restaurant for me, but the food was also sub-par. Do not go here.
We had an early dinner and got to sit on the patio overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  The server was excellent: friendly, attentive, a big smile.  We kept thinking he looked like Steve Harvey.  Food was equally good.  We started with a charcuterie plate with meats, cheeses, dried figs and candied walnuts.  That and the bread, tapenade, and olives could have been its own meal.. . For entrees, my wife got the gnocchi with chicken, olives, and a tomato sauce.  It was probably the lightest, richest gnocchi ever.  I had the sea bass, which was also excellent.  Fish was fresh, fatty, and cooked perfectly.  I didn't care much for the white bean and tomato roulade but did like the brocolini.  We also had tempura green beans that were very good.. . Finally, dessert was yummy.  It was essentially tiramisu made with banana bread.  Whoever came up with that idea is a genius.  A big scoop of vanilla ice cream and more chelate sauce would have made it perfect, but kudos to the dessert chef on this one!. . If you are looking for a nice dinner in Vegas, I highly recommend Olives.
Our large group of sixteen were seated right on time and they were busy, so off to a good start.  This is not a quiet restaurant when its busy, so keep that in mind if you are wanting an intimate evening for two.. . We had a couple of starters that included a meat and cheese tray and a flat bread pizza, both were great.  I had a house salad and loved it.  For dinner, I ordered the salmon entree which was really good and some others had the scallops which were supposed to be excellent too.. . I would go back and hope for the patio seating the next time.
We arrived at 7:30pm for our reservation at 8pm and they were able to seat us early which was really nice. I ordered the beef carpaccio for a starter and the spaghetti and meatballs (one of the specials). My husband ordered the onion soup as a starter and a mushroom pasta dish. I also ordered a glass of wine while my husband had sparkling water. The beef carpaccio was NOT my favorite. If you look at others pictures on here, it's accurate. It's quite big so if you are eating with a vegetarian you are on your own! It had a weird fried polenta cake under salad and then all of the beef was on top of that. I love when beef carpaccio is served with balsamic, capers, etc... but this didn't even taste that great. My waitress asked me what I thought of it and I said, "it's big." She said it's actually only 2oz of meat. It just didn't taste that great and the presentation was off-putting. My husband liked his soup but it was pretty small and he would have probably been happier with a larger bowl (it was definitely a case of size reversal!). They do bring you a basket of bread with olives and 2 types of olive tapenade. The bread was quite good. The spaghetti and meatballs weren't that great either. The meatballs were the best part and had a lot of flavor as there were two types of meat ground together but there was nothing spectacular about the spaghetti or the sauce. I looked for salt at one point but none was to be had and I didn't want to risk offending the chef by asking for some. After the unappetizing starter, I was not that interested anyway and ended up wasting a lot of food since we were in a hotel and didn't have a fridge to take it back to even if I wanted to. My husband said his meal wasn't that great either. The price for 2 starters, 2 entrees, 1 glass of wine and 2 bottles of sparkling wine came out to $180 with tip. That was the most disappointing part. 2 stars are for the great service we had. We loved our waitress and the other servers. They were super attentive and kind. Save your money and go elsewhere!
Todd English himself came to my table and wished me a Happy Birthday.  Does it get any better than that?!?!?!?!?!?!  Completely star struck!  On top of that, our server, his name was Paul, gave us the most AMAZING experience EVER.  He was awesome.  Can't say enough about my experience here.  The food - everything we had was great.  And if I have to recommend one thing, get the Carpaccio.  Share it though because it is ginormous!  . . I had take one star away for two things though (hey, I'm an honest yelper!)... first we made reservations about 4 months in advance of the big bday dinner in Vegas.  We requested a table outside, overlooking the fountains.  When we got there, they said those tables are first come first serve. That's something they should've told us... that way, we would've made our dinner reservations earlier!  But Paul tried and he was so awesome!  And in the end, I'm glad we stayed where we were in his section!  I guess things do work out the way they are supposed to.  The second reason I had to minus a star is because they stuck us onthe smallest table ever for a party of 8.  I mean, we could barely fit our food plates on that table.  But neither of these two things would stop me from coming back to Olives!
Very nice.  A little hard to get in the day I went but it was a Friday...  Wound up with a seat at the bar and other than feeling like I really needed to rush through dinner so they could work another paying customer in it was excellent.  I went with the crazy mushroom pasta - so many levels of flavor going on in here...it was hard to stop.  I did though, and consequently wound up getting 2 meals out of 1 with this dish b/c I had plenty leftover for lunch another day.  It's not too expensive if you take this into consideration.  If you are looking to cut down on the price you might also wanna skip multiple $16 cocktails.  I didn't - I went for the gusto.  Something like a margarita but less sweet and with cilantro had it's hooks in me...  I heard everyone saying the place to sit was the balcony - apparently you wind up with an excellent view of the dancing waters if you sit there...so maybe next time.  Will def go back for that pasta...
25 minute wait despite a reservation for 2. Passed 4 empty tables on the way to ours. Hostess was condescending about the wait time. . . We were promptly attended to by the wait staff,  then had to wait 10 min before we saw anyone again. My water sat empty for over 5 minutes. As the meal progressed,  the service improved. . . The food was excellent as I've come to expect from Olives. The carpaccio was excellent. I wish the early impression and the delay in seating hadn't left such a bad taste in my mouth.
Pretty disappointed after reading the reviews. The Tortelli was too buttery/sweet and was served cold in the center. The flatbread was below average - tasted like a bake-at-home pizza from your local grocery store. Much like all restaurants in Vegas, quite expensive, but the food wasn't even tasty. Definitely not worth the time & money.
there is nothing worse than a bad hostess specially in Las Vegas where you get spoiled with the good service everywhere.. my wife and I were planning on celebrating our 1 yr old daughter birthday at the Belagio fountains . we made a reservation at olives  6 pm knowing that we might have to wait to sit outside since we were told  we can't request it(weird but not my business).. we arrived on time and I immediately checked the patio and found  couple tables available  with no one waiting so I asked to be seated on one of them. .  the answer was no and I have to wait 2-3 hours to sit outside .when  I inquired about the two available tables  she told me they were reserved . after a short argument she failed to explain how they could when i couldn't and there you go she turned extremely rude to exit from the situation  .totally unprofessional, I canceled the reservation and filed a complain with hotel management(still did not hear from them).. hope.  I am an isolated experience .but still this is how I rate them.
Very ordinary food. excellent service. . . I ate there earlier this week and have no specific recall of the food--that is not good.
The atmosphere is beautiful and the food is so good. All the different breads in the bread bowl were amazing and their green olive spread went really well with the breads. I got the ricotta ravioli which was amazing- the raviolis were so fresh and the Italian sausage mixed in was really flavorful. The only only thing was the wine was eh. But that doesn't even matter because of how satisfying the food was.  My man def got it right by picking this place for our last dinner in Vegas!
My friend took me here for a little celebration for my husband. She's been here before and really enjoyed it. I, on the other hand, thinks this this restaurant is a bit overpriced (granted it's on the strip) for food that isn't really that great. I ordered gnocchi which was probably the worst I've yet to have. My sister ordered their scallop and it was heavily salted. The service was OK, not great, not bad. Honestly, I don't think I would come back here. It was good for the experience sitting by the fountain, but they kept turning the music volume high and low which kind of made it not so great.
Went here with my girlfriend Tiffanie who wrote the review below mine lol. The food was very good. I ordered the Fettuccine carbonara which was delish. The bread they give is an assortment. They also give olive spread which didn't look too appetizing but was shocked how good it was with the bread. The service was great also. On a side note we saw Dana White from the UFC eating there so it has to be good right?
I feel that most people come here for flatbreads and drinks. With that said, I feel that maybe I just ordered the wrong things and still want to give this place another chance. Service was great, atmosphere was fun and lively, feels like a place to  have casual business meetings lol And the view of the Bellagio fountains was beautiful.. The beef tartare  was alright, good flavor but nothing impressive (sage is where it's at! Lol). I had the spit roasted pork chop and I was pretty disappointed. The flavor tasted very basic and was actually pretty tough and chewy. I can make a better pork chop at home. My boyfriend had the grilled sirloin and he said it wasn't anything special either. After being disappointed, we didn't try to order dessert. We went to the bacchanal buffet at Caesar's earlier that day and actually preferred that!. I want to come back and try some of  the flatbreads, beef carpaccio, seafood and desserts or just from  a prix fixe menu and hopefully will have a better experience.
