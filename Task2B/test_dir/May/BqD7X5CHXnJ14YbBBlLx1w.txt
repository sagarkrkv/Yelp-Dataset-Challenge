I'm a local and as such maybe a little jaded due to our seemingly never-ending string of poor dining experiences at expensive restaurants on the strip that tout quality chefs. Sadly, like most Vegas eateries in Strip casinos this place suffers from non-attentive service and overpriced fare that is pedestrian at best. We had the raspberry tuna skewers (ok), the sliders (bland), the NY steak (couldn't cut thorough 2 pieces because they were 90% gristle), the monk fish (decent smoky flavor but the least tasty monk fish i've had), the ceviche (for some reason no one in the states can get this right - not authentic, served with only 4 taro chips, decent but not at all as flavorful as that in the Yucatan), and the only tapas we enjoyed - the stuffed dates - which we've had many times at other tapas joints, and these were just as good. ALL our second round of tapas were served cold after a long wait (must have been left at the pass too long), and we had to send them back - upon doing so the manager came out to reassure us, but at no point did he or the server offer to take something off the bill or do something extra for the miscue - not that we expected that, but most places i've had to do this at will extend some sort of peace offering. Not here.. . $150 later we left very disappointed and agreed to avoid Strip restaurants like the plague from now on, unless they are downtown - like Hugo's Cellar, which is a gem with great service and reasonable prices. It seems that these strip places think they're only catering to tourists and will never see you again, at least that's how it feels to dine there. They were right this time, they won't see us again. Back to Firefly for tapas.
Playful, clever...brilliant. . Expected more theatrical gastronomic fireworks...but this was veryrefined and focused.. . Think of this place as dinner and a show...if you appreciate refined, creative, and brilliant food...this place is a must see.. . That said...now that I've done it, I have no interest in going back and...I can't say that about The French Laundry because....at the risk of sounding horribly pretentious, when I ate at the French Laundry, I knew I was doing something special...I knew I was eating at the best restaurant in the world and seeing what those chefs did changed my perception of what food could be.. . This is cool...but it's just a branch of minibar.
I wanted to give this place 5 stars but our waiter was not very friendly.. . We came here Saturday night for my bachelorette party.  The first component that really captures your attention is the ambience. The place is gorgeous.  You have the perfect balance of people watching and romantic/ beautiful ambience that really adds to the flavor of the restaurant and, of course, the food.. . Now for the drinks!  I ordered the first cocktail on the menu: ague de serrano = delicious.  My friends split two pitchers of the white sangria. They said it was good but it tasted like punch. They felt a little of the alcohol afterward, but they said the drinks could have been stronger.  . . For the food, we ordered the mushroom risotto (so yummy!), the asparagus a la plancha, and the goat cheese salad.  A couple of my friends got the octopus, but they said it was very smokey and the octopus was not baby octopus, so expect big tentacles (TMI I know but it was important for flavor based on what my friends said).  Everything else was delicious from the rest of my friends.. . Our waiter was gruff and unfriendly.  He did not come back and check on us during our meal as well.  The rest of the wait staff was great and kept our water glasses full.  We complained to the manager, and he apologized but we already paid, so he couldn't do much.  He said he would speak with the waiter. . . Overall, would go again. Veg, meat, and vegan options available :)
Whimsical, vibrant & upbeat restaurant with friendly service to top off the overall experience.. . Drink the Agua de Serrano-a crisp and spicy cocktail made with tequila, rum, cava and hananero infused syrup...banger!!. . Eat the white ceviche served with thin taro root crisps.  I'd maybe pass on the crispy artichoke...I liked it but I think it could have used some salt or some kind of hot sauce.. . The menu has so many delectible options but I stopped there.   I'll definitely make it a point to visit again and sample some more.
Really cute place! We absolutely LOVED the fresh sangria. There are three different choices, each flavor better than the next. We were just stopping by for a snack since we had dinner reservations later in the evening, but were luckily able to try the black rice and stuffed peppers. Both were amazing. The black rice was better than any tapa we could even find in Spain, a must try for sure!! The staff was soo nice and helpful. We will definitely be back!
Situated right by the lobby/reception area inside Aria, didn't really have whole lot of expectation. Just wanted to eat inside our hotel b4 headed out to B. Spears concert. Boy o Boy...was it a surprise!!!!!!! First off, it's Saturday night around 7pm, restaurant is jam packed yet we had our table on the dot. Servers were quick and delivery of food was timed perfectly. i loved EVERY dish...giving 5star (back-to-back) is not something i do lightly, i am pretty picky. This spot is fun, colorful and makes you happy and smiley just sitting. TVs located around so you don't miss out on a good game. . . Sauteed Foie Gras (pear was beautifully roasted, presentation is gorgeous). Mixed Seafood Ceviche with shrimp, white fish and octopus (not too sour, just right). Spicy Tuna on a cone (like ice-cream that melts in your mouth). Charcuterie platter (can you really get enough of this stuff, not me!). 48 hours short ribs (to diiiiiie for, it is sweet and buttery). Flan (this is not the usual creme texture, i like it alot). Wine was flowing!. . Finished dinner at 8:30pm, just in time to catch a cab to the show...
It's conveniently located by the casino level close to the main lobby of the hotel - very contemporary and modern style/design. Perfect for grabbing quick small bites. Definitely has "delish" options in their menu. Don't eat there and not try their Sangria - so good.  Had an amazing dinner there and service was pretty good too. I will definitely recommend this. One of the best tapas style restaurant on the strip.
Second visit and always enjoy this restaurant and it's many tapa selections.  Sit at the bar and be entertained by Jeffrey, one of the bartenders.  He is one of the best around, upbeat and fun and full of suggestions.  The tuna cones are my favorite, but everything is tasty and presented very well.  Try the peach sangria!
Could not have imagined a better experience. Had prearranged a package that included unlimited sangria with one of the managers prior to our visit.  We let them choose the food.  So glad we did.  Food was amazing.  I couldn't believe the quantity and the quality of the food that kept coming out of the kitchen, including dessert. AND, our glasses were never empty.. Service was exceptional, from the manager to the bussers.  . I can't wait to go back
Love it, Love it, Love it.  Much better than the competition and great atmosphere.  . . Quick tip, if you make reservations, be prepared to wait another 30 minutes on busy nights to get your table.  We ended up eating at the bar, which was way better as you can see each dish coming out of the kitchen.  . . The tuna tartare cones were unbelievable!  Must have!  They are literally tartare, avocado, and an array of goodies in a very small ice cream cone (like the size of your pinky).  You get four in an order and they deliver in every way!
We were excited to try Julian Serrano because of their ceviche and array of tapa menus! I ordered the mixed seafood ceviche- it was meh okay.  Nothing special.  Also the steamed the mussels that were pretty good.  The other girls ordered the spare ribs andmushroom risotto - nothing specatuclar :-(
The location is great, located inside right at one of the entries to Aria. The food overall is very mediocre. The soup was outstanding, we got both the seafood and mushroom. The entrees were sent back, the braised short ribs came out too overcooked and hard. The second reorder I got was just ok, I ordered fish which seemed fresh however did not measure up to a $30 price tag. My friend ordered ribs, which were awful. Dessert was ok, did not stack up to a high end restaurant. Overall I expected a much better experience. Service was average, one of the drinks ordered didn't come out, the dessert should have been comped.
This is an upscale tapas joint. Spicy meatballs were great. Good wine. Pricier than normal tapas.
Weekend in Vegas with the wife, teenage kids and another family.  Looking for something different - tired of over-the-top steakhouses and big-name chefs.  Someone told us about Julian Serrano. "Never heard of it!" I said -- 'lets check it out". So glad we did!!  Great experience.  Got us seated promptly, courteous staff.  Our waiter advised a few dishes, took him up on a few and tried a few others that we found interesting.  Loved it!!  Food was flavorful, medium sized dishes meant to be shared (tapas).  Adults really enjoyed, but the best testimonial was from our 18 year old, two 17 year olds and one 16 year old.  These kids have enjoyed fine dining in many locations around the world and they REALLY enjoyed the food and the experience.  My 16 year old boy said, "best meal he's had in Vegas" (after many trips!).  I'm hard to please and don't write reviews, but I felt compelled to let others know about this place.  Go there!
I have to give this place two stars. I have never had any tapas here that I've really enjoyed. Their drinks are delicious and have perfect balance so I will give them that. The service was excellent as well. I have come here twice now and tried a number of tapas on their menu. I never reviewed it last year when we came but this year we ordered, the Mediterranean bass which was my favorite out of our choices, we also ordered the chicken croquettes which were bland, and the spicy meatball which we didn't know would be fried. We stopped here because we were unhappy with our choices. I've had tapas here in Baltimore that have been 10x better and for half the price. I would not return to this restaurant.
Food is always delicious here. I had the romaine, albondigas and some mixed paella. However, the albondigas came an hour late, the paella came out 1.5 hours late, after repeatedly it asking our server. The manager made up for it. We weren't charged for the dishes.
