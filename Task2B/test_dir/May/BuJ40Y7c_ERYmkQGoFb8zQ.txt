My boyfriend and I met in Vegas for a weekend away and stayed here.  Upon pulling up, I immediately felt like old Vegas.  The kind you see in the old gangster movies; I can't out my finger on it specifically, but I loved it.  The entry way was solid glass doors and marble floors.  There was no line, so check in was super simple.  My boyfriend quickly made a new friend in the concierge and they chatted about football.  We got up to our room and it was cool and roomy.  The bathroom was amazing and spacious too.  For us being over 6' each, we absolutely appreciated this fact!. . The bed was super comfy and there were so many pillows; I loved it!  The windows were actually able to open to overlook the strip... that was pretty cool!  We ate at the restaurant on the second floor in the hotel one night and it was a buffet that night.  That was the most delicious buffet I've ever attended.  We had wine and watched all the strange people walking around to their rooms.  . . The staff was friendly and courteous; they were always willing to help out.  The guys out front calling cabs were so helpful and efficient.  When the last day came around,that was a wonderful thing!. . I would definitely stay here again for the price, the location, the comfort, and the space!
Actually I didn't stay in the hotel, but I had much more fun in its casino.. All stuff including hotel & casino were rly friendly, even guests & players were so funny & we had a good time gambling together.. Next time I'm sure it would be the first on my preferences list!!!!
Tropicana is where you have to catch a lot of shuttles to get to where you need to go. They also have shows you might be interested in. Shops like other hotels too. My favorite part, is that they have my favorite slot machine there & this place is decorated in all pinks, orange & purples. Its right next to MGM.
I am sure that many people who come to Las Vegas to gamble or vacation and who have a large tolerance for smoke can enjoy this hotel.  I came here for a technical meeting and found this hotel very inappropriate for that purpose.  My single star is in that context.. . 1.  Walking in and out of the hotel from either my room or the conference section, required walking through a very long and very smoky casino.  (Smoke gives me a headache.). 2.  The air conditioning seems to connect all sections of the enterprise, so the air quality in even nominally smoke-free rooms was poor.. 3.  Everything costs.  There is no in-room coffee and everything in the shops is expensive - $3.25 for a cookie.  Bring your own hot water pot and snacks.. . Most of the staff was pleasant and helpful, but I did note that the Indian guy ahead of me in line at a buffet in the Havana room did not get much interest from staff when he asked about vegetarian food.
Paid for a king strip view in the paradise tower and upon checking in they put us in a club tower room, when I complained the front desk said there was nothing they could do and even though I received a confirmation and prepaid that didn't guarantee my room. The front desk said that the room they gave us was comparable to the one I had reserved, yeah.....right, We had a wonderful view of the airport and could not sleep due to the noise, I checked online and the room they gave us was cheaper than the one I had originally booked. Also the fan to the bathroom was extremely loud, when I checked the filter, it was caked with dirt and lint. I would recommend to stay else where, it is really far from everything and there are far better hotels around.
Let's start by saying that I went down for a large birthday party October 2013, we had 7 rooms booked for our group, and only one room was "fine."  Our first room was in the back by the parking lot, where all night there were headlights shining in and loud thumping music, so we requested to be moved. Our second room felt damp and smelled like cigarettes, even though it was a non smoking room, there were several questionable stains on the carpet. . . But the worst part was the BLACK MOLD on the grout of the shower, and chipped out grout.  This is supposed to be newly remodeled, but it was done very cheaply with no quality control.. . We requested to be moved again, even back to our loud room, but they said they were booked solid.  We requested some one to come clean it and that was about 6 pm.  At 2:30 am we finally got a knock on the door to clean.  We were already in bed, but desperately wanted it cleaned, so we fell asleep to the smell of bleach and scrubbing.. . In the other rooms, one couple checked out due to similar problems.  The birthday couple's room wasn't ready, and they had to wait 2 hours for their room, even though we all checked in at 9 pm.  There were other complaints about cleanliness from the people in the group, but they can write their own reviews.. . The cantina down by the pool had a completely incompetent bartender who kept walking away and forgetting our order, so we had to repeat it 3 times before he thought to write it down.  I had to walk away before I snapped.. . Oh, and why does the pool area need to play really loud club music in the morning?  it was deafening and drove us away.. . Upon leaving, we had to stash our luggage at the bag check for a few hours which would have been great of they hadn't "lost" it.  It took the guy forever and he came back to say that he didn't think we had checked any or maybe we had picked it up earlier?  No, bud, we would have remembered if we had picked up our luggage already.  He then asked if we remembered which room he had put them in... We ended up escorting him and finding our own bags for him.  In the process, we could have collected any number of bags for all he bothered to care or check. . . BEWARE!
Love the new digs, but really the line to check in. Even being a diamond level hilton honors???? Your check really need some improving!!! Come on Trop!!
I have stayed at the Aria, the Wynn, and the Luxor while in Vegas and would NEVER recommend anyone stay here. My fiance and I were meeting another couple in Vegas and while we were driving from Phoenix, they were flying in from Atlanta, and I wanted to limit their costs so I agreed to stay here. Based on the price, and the reputation of having the best pool in Vegas, we booked our rooms. I have NO idea how this place got best pool? Maybe back when it was built?? I booked us a Bungalow room with hopes of having a nicer than standard room and got a decent deal through their website. Self parking was free and that was about the nicest thing I could say about this place.. . There are no doormen to help you when you arrive, not that you expect that at this level of hotel but it would have been nice given the double doors and carrying suitcases. Check-in went smoothly and we were told we could pick up our cookies from another location within the hotel. I have no idea why they wouldn't have them at the Registration desk, if only to hope you forget about picking up their free cookie...which we did.. . Walking through the casino you are engulfed by smoke. Many, if not all, of the newer properties in Vegas have a much better ventilation system to handle the smoke. This place was like something out of the 80s. The casino floor was very small and only one small area of tables. When we were at the tables or slots, we were never approached by a cocktail waitress at either. . . The Bungalow rooms are behind a locked door that you have to use your key to access. This gave me high hopes that our room would be really nice. They were quickly squashed...not to mention you almost get knocked over if someone is leaving the Bungalow area. Watch out for those red doors! We were put on the second floor and the elevator in this area is TINY. And SLOW. We only took the elevator when arriving the first day and leaving on our last. The rest of the time we took the stairs and that's never a pleasant experience anyway.. . Upon entering our room 5234, there was a musty smell and we were startled by the extremely loud door slamming behind us. Since our door did this, it meant everyone's did this, so it made for a noisy experience as people don't catch the doors on the way in and out. The room was spacious but no mini fridge (though not the norm in Vegas) but it would have been appreciated for the two mini water bottles they provided. The bathroom was small with very limited room on the vanity. They supplied you with shampoo, conditioner and lotion...NO body wash so bring your own.  In addition, the toilet paper holder was broken and housekeeping neatly folded the toilet paper end and placed it on the back of the toilet. Classy. In addition, there was a very long, dark hair hanging off the bathroom door handle. It remained there the whole 4 days we were there. The hair dryer is also terrible so plan on bringing your own of that too. The one good thing was the shower had nice pressure and a nice tiled floor and walls.. . Our bed was comfortable but definitely basic and the pillows were comfortable. The linens were horrible though. They felt extremely cheap and thin. The room had nice artwork...and that's about the best I can compliment it. . . The patio included in the bungalow room was nice but overlooking the pool only reminded me that I will never stay here again. The pool was ugly with cheap looking chairs, an ugly walkway and no inspiration anywhere. I still have no idea how it ever won best pool in Vegas.. . For all the deals they provide in Vegas, spend a little extra more and stay somewhere nicer even if you aren't in your room that much.
I love the place. Not the typical dark casino. Everything is light and friendly. The dealers are super nice. Try to find Tracy. She is so much fun to play with. Overall a good place to stay.
OK, I'm approaching this from the business/convention visitor perspective, and that it is a Doubletree.. . The bad:  If you've got status with HHonors, you expect certain things that go with each brand. With Doubletree, your stay opens with "the cookie".  Well, unless you're hungry for cardboard, you're going to be disappointed - you get a certificate for a cookie, which the cafe may or may not be open.. . Breakfast buffet for gold and higher (I'm higher)? Nope, you may select three items from the cafeteria... and the line may take longer to get through than a real buffet.  At worst with the DT, I've been given a free continental breakfast with a option to buy the full one.  The cafeteria was a no-go.  Note this was a change from a year prior when I stayed and we were given access to the buffet.  . . Wireless internet was not good, and very oddly worded.  when you get online, it almost make it look like you're limited on the download to like 1mb.  In truth you are limited to speed - not total content download.  In the end, I could live with it, but had to fire up the Verizon card (connectivity issue there too) to get Skype working.. . Fitness center that closes at 7pm?  BIG MISS.  . . Pool closing at 7pm?  Big miss.. . . The good:. . The beds were comfortable and clean as was the room.  (points deducted for the old, rusted tub).  For a casino, the area downstairs wasn't horrible. I'd label it a good business class hotel with a casino.. . . This place misses the Doubletree brand promise at several points.  Take away the expectations of the doubletree and its OK.  The pool and fitness center closings chapped me.
The Tropicana Hotel and Casino recently got a face lift. It still isn't the prettiest, the coolest, or the nicest casino on the Strip. I respect the owners for keeping it the only family run casino on Las Vegas Boulevard. It's one of the only casino on the strip that has a locals friendly feel to it. . . The rooms are nice and have been upgraded. Flat screen tellys, big bathtubs, free WiFi, comfy beds, and awesome views of the strip (if you're high enough up and your room faces North).. . The Havana Room which previously housed several failed day/nightclubs (RPM, Nikki Beach, and Bagatelle) is now rented out for private parties and events. Still a beautiful space.. . The Comedy Stop at the Trop is no more and is now the Laugh Factory pulling in top comedians and this place also has one of the grooviest lounge bands of all. Mama Mia! is now playing in their theater. There is also a mid-day magic show too.. . Like all casinos, there's lots of slots, table games, and card games. Several restaurants, various bars, and lots of crazy carpeting and no clocks to be found anywhere.
Best Trip Ever.   We arrived a little before check-in time and thankfully our room was ready. The room was on floor 5 of the Paradise Tower with an amazing strip view. . This is not our first trip here so I have a few tips;.   Valet park..   Bellman service if you have more than a light load of bags..   Free Chocolate Chip Cookie..   The Lounge has live band playing and  they were quite good..   Request Paradise Tower as it is closer to all the action..   Laugh Factory Rocks..    Have you ever had a trip where you just couldn't loose? This was that kind of trip. I'm not a high roller at all, I just play slots and video poker. the first night I was up $300.00 and the second night I hit a royal flush progressive for over $1,600.00. Drink service was awesome..  .    Aside from all of that me and my wife had a great time sight seeing and listening to live music in the lounge..    Rupaul was here filming Drag Race in the Havana Room and the place was full of amateur  transvestites and some were just funny as can be falling off of their size 20 high heels sporting a five o'clock shadow. I can't make up stuff this funny.
The bungalow room has just basic elements. There is no refrigerator for storing cold drinks. The drinks @ the bar were average for the strip. A beer was $8.50. . . Back to the room, the room was muggy when we got in but the air-conditioning worked well so the room cooled down quick. . . The bed comfort was average. There were plenty of pillows. It had an iPod/radio which I didn't try but it seemed to work at least in telling time. . . Even though check out was @ 11 we were able to check out by 12 @ no charge so that was a nice touch considering I didn't wake up till 10 am. . . The room had a descent view of the Excalibur and Luxor and navigating to the various hotels was very easy. . . Good location in terms of accessibility to different shops on the Las Vegas strip.
All I can say is Wow!!! Those of us that knew the Old Tropicana would never have imagined that it would be what it is today. . . Rooms are tropical and up to todays Vegas standards.  The casino is bright, vibrant and smells like paradise.   It seems everything about the Trop now is fresh and impressive.
Let's just say I started off my night at the wraparound suite at the Cosmo and ended up checking in at 1am to the tropicana the same night.. I was asked to tell my guest to leave as I was celebrating my 21st birthday at the Cosmo so I ended up driving down the street and checking in to the Trop .I was so angry and stressed out but the woman at the front desk made the check in process so fast and simple I even asked before checking in if it was okay to have some of my friends over and she was like Yes of course and gave me extra keys.i had a fabulous stay I stayed in the high roller penthouse suite and it was AMAZING they even price matched on hotel tonight Exactly as pictured nice big spacious living and master bedroom amazing jacuzzi and I absolutely loved the "homey" feel it had.Thank goodness for wooden floors or else I might never have gotten my deposit back we played music and had a great time with no one ever even coming to bother us once.Trop didn't having that luxurious feel but I'd choose the high roller suite over wraparound anyday.Thanks for a great stay and a night to remember Trop! Will def be back :)
