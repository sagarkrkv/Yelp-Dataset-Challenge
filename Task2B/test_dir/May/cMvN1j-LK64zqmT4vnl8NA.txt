Came to grab a quick bite. Had the lotus chips, enmoladas, caldo, sui mai beef, fried rice, refried bean taco, and grilled fish taco. Some dishes were fusion, some were not, all are good. Those giving this place a bad review probably had the wrong expectations. Service was great, no wait, food came out quick and fresh, ambiance was chill.
I do not understand how this place only has three stars. It was amazing. No, it is not "fusion" - it is Chinese food and Mexican food, but shutup. It was AWESOME.. . We let our waiter be our guide and worked our way through the most incredible, soft, pillowy steam buns, lobster and pork tacos, flavorful shrimp mojo, sui mai, har gow, fried steam buns, and mango "sticky rice". . . Everything was full of flavor, inventive, and fun. Our waiter recommended the golden pig (fried) steam buns for last, since they come with a sweetened condensed milk and reminded him more of a dessert, and he was 100% right. It made for a good transitional course.. . Will definitely be back. Enjoyed every bite.
Good looking spot! Food is a bit over priced but to break it down:. . Chips & Gauc were good, had a kick to it.  Service wasgood, for 20 people the staff did pretty good.  Taco's, I believe were best part. Chicken and Pork. For a taco, it does seem a bit pricey, but great for a quick bite and back to the tables. Btw, we waited a long time for this place, and overall, the food was A-Okay.
We ordered the $55 tasting option & we were so happy we did! It was the perfect amount (we were all stuffed though) and the selection was delicious. They brought out the best of the best, including homemade churros! Everything was timed perfectly & the service was excellent. Margs were also delish. I would consider this to be more of a casual restaurant, nothing too fancy. Would def go back.
This place is Mexican/Chinese....hence the name. It was my first time there and I really liked the atmosphere. It's very casual considering the location. It's an upscale place but at the same time you can go in with shorts/shirts. The services was great.  We had the queso fundido and had the fried wontons and they were great!! Their tortillas are hand-made!! I think the prices are reasonable. Even though I can only judge on the appetizers, I think this place is worth it.
It's a shame that this place doesn't have better food. Chinese/Mexican concept is great because I'm a fan of both, but the execution just didn't work. The Dan Dan Mian didn't have much flavor other than an overwhelming taste of salt. The Gan Pung Ji chicken was dry, and the Lucky Sui Mai tasted like frozen dim sum that was simply heated. The only positive memory I have was that their guacamole was good. The ambience of the restaurant and its location inside the Cosmopolitan really has a lot of potential. If only the food didn't suck.
We'd always been curious to try this place since we're regular Cosmopolitan guests.  Suffice it to say our first visit to China Poblano will be our last.  Unfortunately we didn't read the Yelp reviews before going there. When the average is 3 stars, and people seem to say the guacamole is the best thing about the place, it should be avoided.  . . All we had were two Salt Air Margaritas, which our server told us were 'amazing' house specialties.  They were different for sure, but not amazing. Ours arrived in small glasses with nearly half of it covered in a salty foam.  Some may view this as culinary genius, while others may view it as a way to get away from using alcohol.  It tasted like lime and salt and that was it.  They were gone in three small sips ... no joking.  All that was left was foam.I seriously wonder if there was any alcohol in it at all, and they came to over $30 with tax!  We ordered the margaritas right off the bat (big mistake... I know), and the server said, "I'll be back with your drinks and then I can explain our menu to you."  It was a little weird that a place has to explain the menu, but China Poblano does, apparently.. . He said the fried rice was featured on a Food Network show, and then added some tidbits of info about certain dishes.  Nothing seemed all that great, and we looked around and observed other guests who were either confused or unhappy.  It's not so much a fusion menu as a confusion menu.  And guacamole for $15?  Seriously?  The waiter tried way too hard to sell the menu, and it was a complete turn-off.  . . The Cosmo has some nice restaurants.  This isn't one of them.
This was tough to grade, because there were two different worlds in this restaurant. There's the Mexican side, and there's the Chinese side, with not a lot of fusion mixes, it was either purely Chinese or Mexican. I would say the Chinese food was actually pretty good, the shumai's were pretty inventive and tasty, I like the fish eggs on them, gave a lil nice pop sensation and the pork mix was good. I also like the house made vinegar/soy sauce mix, it was delicious! The Mexican cuisine part however, was terrible. The taco's, burritos were all so bland to me. In fact, I didn't even want to finish it, I gave the rest of my tacos to my friend who was famished and was lamenting the whole time of "why did we choose a damn tapas place right after a pool party, this place is wack!" he just wanted to fill his belly up, understandably so. Agreed on that point, and on that same point, if I couldn't even bare to finish a beef taco after a pool party, that says a lot about that beef taco. So if you eat here, my recommendation is to stick to the Chinese dishes! The Mexican dishes were just awful.
Im always quite iffy on this place. I love Jose Andres, Im a huge fan of his work for the Bazaar, but this place just seems A-OK for me.. . I love the concept of Mexican and Asian. It is honestly a dream come true for me. Tacos and Noodles! What an awesome combo, especially if one is inebriated. I usually only dine here based on the sole reason of convience.. . Tacos and Noodles (especially the noodle soups) just dont seem worth it to me to pay those extra bucks. I understand that it is by Jose Andres, and I understand that its expensive, and I understand that its meant to be in small portions, and I understand that its suppose to be gourmet-esque, a cream of the crop type of ideal.. BUT.... I just dont see the possibility of tacos and noodle soups being capable of elevated at that high of a level. Its like taking something wayyy out of its comfort zone and making it work. . . Long story short, the food is delicious, the prices are pretty high, the portions are very small, the location is very convenient for those staying in the Cosmopolitan. . . Will I ever eat here sober? NO. Will I ever eat her inebriated? YES. . UNTIL THEN!! ^-^
