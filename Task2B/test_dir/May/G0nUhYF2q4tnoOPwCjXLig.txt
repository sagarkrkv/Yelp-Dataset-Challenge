I was actually surprised how much I liked staying at this place despite the negative reviews. I've stayed at multiple places on the strip and ONE this place doesn't actually smell like cigarettes and old people the second you walk in, giant plus. The check in can be a little long, but just apply for an Mlife card and you get VIP check in (you can apply online or in the casinos). This is one of the more kid-friendly hotels on the strip with the whole "castle" appeal and an arcade downstairs called the "Fun Dungeon". We spent some time gambling for free drinks then going downstairs to play DDR and Air Hockey, like all the cool 20-something-year-olds do. Hahaha . The pricing is really great too. We paid 63 dollars (not including resort fees) for a 2 queen bedroom with a great view of the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Tower two is a bit nicer, just because it's the newer tower of them all. They do offer smoking and none smoking rooms. . Parking here can either be Valet or self parking, I felt the parking lot was safe enough to stay in, and it was free too!. You do have the ability to ride the free tram to get to either one of those hotels quickly, or there is a quick walkway to get on the strip.. I love that this place has Dicks last resort... A hilarious restaurant to check out if you've never been to one, you have to take everything they say with a grain of salt, but they do have a great happy hour!. I'll definitely be staying here again, had a great time.
Given 90% of the hotels we went through involved you having to walk through a smoky casino, I'm not going to hate on the Excalibur for the smokiness, since it was a fair price and you do get what you pay for.. . Since we wanted to spend our day either hitting attractions or sitting poolside, this place did nicely as the pool area was adequate and we were able to walk or bus wherever needed from the strip. . . HOTEL / ROOMS: The lobby and casino does stink of smoke and air freshener, and the hallways do seem like a scene from the Shining... However once inside the rooms (even the Tower 1 rooms), while the furniture is quite dated, the mattress is new and comfy, the bathroom is clean, there is a safe in the room, an iron and ironing board in the closet, a half decent tv, and you can come up with many creative ways to make up for the fridge with ice and garbage pails. Okay, a fridge would be a nice touch but they are rare to find in 3 star hotels. As for the timeshare people, they are pretty easy to spot. If anyone in a navy blue blazer comes up just say "no thanks" or "have a good day" as they attempt to make discussion with you. . . SMOKE AVOIDANCE TIP: if you're not actually going to gamble, you only need to spend time in the casino or lobby when making your way to the pool or the foodcourt. Otherwise walk out the doors near the elevators and walk around to the front walkways and off the property.. . FOOD: The food court is convenient, although much of the food is not very good and definitely not healthy. But itredeems itself for allowing me to repeatedly destroy a 20 pack of chicken McNuggets at 3 in the morning. We also got an all day pass for the buffet one day, and breakfast and lunch were admittedly pretty good even though there wasn't many people there (it was mid week and we went during off hours). We went to the Luxor for dinner just to change it up and was very unimpressed. Seemed just like lunch, but with a few extra salads and a couple new (but terrible) meats available. It was worth the price of eating for the day but I couldn't imagine eating there multiple days of it. . . POOL: nice pool areas, on the weekend they opened the 3rd pool which even had a slide. Was able to find a recliner most of the time, sometimes a bit of scouring and timing required. Only twice did I notice children in the adults pool section and we were out there pretty much every day. Service was quite spotty for getting a drink but once you actually got the waitresses attention they were typically very friendly.. . SPA: terrible, untrained and underskilled employees, waste of money according to my wife.
I didn't stay in the rooms but I played craps in the casino and the dealers were fantastic. They helped me out with understanding the game and were very polite.
Haven't stayed here in a while and am reminded why. Let me say if I was in college this place is probably heaven...being mid 30's I guess I want a little more than what we got at Excalibur.. This very smoky hotel seems old and outdated.  I thought I heard they renovated, my fault on that end for not really looking into it.. Beds are comfy but it's downhill from there. Old antiquated a/c unit that is hard to differentiate between the a/c or the nearby airport.  No fans in the bathroom, holes in the chairs in the main room...old and breaking down feel overall!. The pool has 1 full pool closed for the season, not too big of loss, but keeping inline with old and broken they have poolside chairs that are certainly not comfortable...and many have rips in them. If you want a good chair you have to "rent" it for the day. Obviously many feel the same as we do about renting them seeing as most  chairs are open. So, the masses get hearded to the old broken down chairs.. We won't be back and would will willing pay more for a better place. If budget is your goal, this place will do. If overall comfort and up to date with, at a minimum, pool chairs that aren't old and ripped, and poolside chairs you don't have to rent(and I'm not talking about the cabanas all hotels have to rent poolside), certainly go elsewhere. Friendly staff though!
It's tough for me to down rate things in Vegas. I had a love for the city engrained into me when I was younger. Excalibur was one of the few that I never really explored, but was always wanting to.. . Sadly, there was some bad with the good. . . First off you are hit with the undeniable stench of years and years of smoke. For a Haligonian who has been in a city with a stone cold, steadfast, smoking ban, this was the first shock.. . Second bad is the sales people who pray on people naive enough to let them take their spiel. Lines like "are you married" or "are you coming back to Vegas in the next year" will lead to a sales pitch that has you putting down 200 bucks on them, and it's "refundable at any time, with no strings attached" which is simply the mantra of if it sounds too good to be true, it is. On top of it, it's a non-stop assault. These people are situated in front of the rooms entrances which is just disgusting to me.. . Thirdly was housekeeping and I. First off, we find a sheet with blood on it. Not a huge deal, and really in a huge hotel.. not a huge surprise. Called down and the guy comes up with the wrong sheet. Again, not a huge deal. Then he comes back with a full bed of bedding and hands it to us.. and walks away. Alright so making my own bed on vacation... Then to 'fix' this mistake on their end, they clean our room with a do not disturb sign on.. and lose the remote. THEN on the last morning, open the door as they knock.. walking in on me changing. Just not good at all.. . But it's not all bad... . . The front desk staff are amazing. The 20 dollar trick does work, do a google search if you're not sure what I am talking about.. . The hotel is a member of the MLife group, which gives you free money in the form of discounts from it's app/facebook game, MyVegas.. if you are headed to Vegas anytime, GET THIS APP.. I saved almost $300 dollars on a 25% discount on rooms, a free ticket to LOVE by Cirque Du Soleil and bogo for the buffet in Excalibur. Message me if you have any questions.. . It's a fun hotel with some of Vegas' old school charm back when they used to care if families wanted to be there.
I wish that I could comment on the rooms, but I live in Las Vegas, so I always sleep at home.. However, I met a family member there tonight, and on my walk from the parking lot to his tower, I saw the whole casino floor.. I have to say that there are more penny slots in this casino than there are at any other casino on the Strip.. It was as if a locals' casino was transplanted into a Strip hotel (old carpets and smoky atmosphere included.). Not only that, but I saw that there were lots of franchise eateries such as Pizza Hut, Dairy Queen, etc., which is great when want to eat a snack without having to spend $20-30.. It was also pretty empty, even for a Wednesday night. There were empty areas all over the floor. My step-brother even remarked that they could fit a whole banks of slot machines in some of the empty spaces.. But all of that is fine by me. Less bumping into people and less shoving around (which is a health hazard at my age.). A-OK is my assessment.
I finally got around writing a review on the Excalibur Hotel. This used to be one of our favorite hotels when we go to Vegas with the children. Not until our recent trip to Vegas that we will never go back again. We stayed here for two nights experiencing bed bugs and lack of follow-up from their customer relations team. I would say that guest satisfaction is not that important to them. I would give this hotel a zero if I could.. . The check-in process was quick and easy. If the check-in person could smile a little then it would make the hotel feels much like a fairy tale castle? . . Tower I haven't been updated/refinished in many years. The room in Tower I was very stuffy. It seems like they haven't got around to fixing the ventilation in this part of the casino. The first night we went into the hotel and had to move out to Tower II. We couldn't stop scratching our legs and arms because of bed bugs. . . Tower II is the newer and cleaner side of the casino. We had minor itching in this room also, perhaps had brought the pests with us from Tower I. . . I would go to Circus Circus with the children next time, at least the air throughout the casino is fresher and doesn't feel like an oven of smoke. . . In case you wanted to know, we didn't get comp for this experience.
Excalibur Hotel is child's play compared to the elite hotel resorts of Las Vegas ... at 1/2 the price tag ... making it a deal for you bargain hunters or families on vacation. If you have children or need a "beginner" hotel for the whole Vegas experience, choose Excalibur.. . Welcome to the future site of a cool five-star Vegas Mecca. Once they tear this down and build a new mega-resort, you can tell your grandkids that you stayed here back when it was Excalibur. . . Until then, here's what you'll find .... .  * Hotel Rooms ... nothing fancy, but you've slept in worse (probably).  * A Casino with lower table limits and more frowns.  * A small Sports Book for Dad to prove he was right about the home team.  * Food is like choosing a restaurant at your local mall.   ... Excalibur Buffet ($23 for dinner and less for breakfast or lunch).   ... Buca di Beppo - American chain of Italian-style re-heated food.   ... Dick's Last Resort - The Applebee's of Vegas.   ... A Steakhouse with $41 Rib Eye Steak or a 3-course Sirloin meal for $37.   ... Baja Fresh - Mexican Fast Food.   ... Food Court with Krispy Kreme, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Cinnabon, & more.   ... Octane Lounge (Fri/Sat) & the "Lounge" are bars for adults to reminisce.  * Entertainment is great if you're letting mom plan your trip.   ... Tournament of Kings: Jousting banquet ($66) using your hands to eat.   ... Thunder From Down Under: Mom's/Girl's Night Out ($57 - $67) - chiseled abs.   ... Australian Bee Gees - Tribute show ($45-$60) not as fun as Fallon & Timberlake on SNL.   ... Fun Dungeon is a huge arcade full of games (10am-10pm).   ... Pool with bar & food service full of kids taking a Dungeon break.   ... Shopping is limited to mall-style boutiques for kids and mom's.   ... A Wedding Chapel - Good luck..  * That funky aroma you smell is annoyed disappointment ... or weed. . For now, Excalibur survives as a low-end property in the MGM Resorts brand (with the MGM, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay, Aria, Vdara, Mirage, and Bellagio). Its prime location on the South end of the Vegas Strip at the corner of Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd is the future site of something much, much better. Til then, Excalibur has accepted it's cheap existence and you should, too.
Older hotel.  Casino smells like a combo of cig smoke, body odor, and bad beer.  Jut a walk through will make you want a shower.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  We stayed here for one night passing through because we were doing their Tournament of Kings show.  Stay somewhere nicer, but do watch the show!!!  Very fun for the whole family.
This is one of the cheaper places to stay, so if you're looking for a budget friendly on strip hotel, this is a good choice. They have a large pool area with many pools. I'm not a fan of the hotel setup, it doesn't have a separate lobby like many of the other strip hotels, so you have to put up with the casino noises and smells when checking in. . . Stayed in a tower 2 room, the room was spacious and clean, bed was comfortable and it was quiet. We had a huge 2 person tub with a view of NY NY across the street, this was really neat and we made the effort to pick up some bath salts to enjoy a romantic soak.. . The casino is very typical vegas, noisy and smells of cigarettes, some casinos have found a way to get the smoke smell out, some haven't. This is a big hotel for families, so if you hate kids running around, maybe best to avoid. The food court is convenient for quick bites or snacks.. . Overall good experience for this stay, and ultimately it's vegas for cheaper, chances are you'll spend more time away from the hotel then at it.
One of the most disappointing experiences I have had with a hotel and casino buffet.. The receptionists at check-in were rude. Most of bartenders rude, and no luggage check-in assistance unless valet parking included; packed our luggage through the casino as carts were for Valet only. Room was quite inferior although advertised with refridgerator, coffee pot, tub/shower..was not. Check-out the same bad experience; was greeted with a "grunt" and no eye contact.. The Buffet was awful, with price outrageous. Food cold, dry and no one attending the area. . Choose another if you go to Vegas....hope they are not all like this.
I was very worried about staying here. But when I entered the room I realized everything would be ok. . . The room does have a faint smell, but nothing I can't deal with. The bed is comfortable. Clean towels and sheets, no random hairs that happen sometimes. Carpet is stain free ect. Not terrible for the price I payed.
I stayed here last week because it was such a great deal and learned my lesson the hard way. I started getting bit on the first night and it got worse on the second night. I realized they were BEDBUG bites once I was home and had already spread them to my house. I submitted an incident report as soon as realized what happened and after not receiving a response or callback, I followed up and was was told that the room was inspected and nothing was found. I couldn't believe what I was hearing so I asked for a copy of the report and they told me that they wouldn't share it with me. WHAT?!?!?! How can that be?? So shady. DON'T RISK STAYING HERE no matter how good the deal is!!!
Could use a decor upgrade for sure but nothing went wrong. Cheap and I would stay there again because of the price but it's nothing special.
The only reason I gave 4 stars was they upgraded our room at no extra charge.   I liked the selections of food in the food court.  All the places are familiar if you just want a quick bite without having to examine the menu, and the prices are reasonable. I also like taking the train to the casinos instead of walking.  If it wasn't for my AAA discount I think the cost is a little over priced.  It also would have been nice to have a little fridge in the room.
It's a nice hotel to stay  just around the strip area which is my favorite spot in vegas since I don't gamble, but here's the downside, their housekeeping crew should better understand the word privacy and cleanliness. They will just enter your room while you're still asleep with the pls don't disturb  tag hanging by the door knob . Cleaning the mess which the maintenance people left took 4 days to get cleaned.  Not coming back here even if they'll offer a free room, thanks but no thanks!!
I'm going to go against the grain here and give this place 4 stars. . . Over the past couple years, this place has been working hard to make modern upgrades. They have completely redone their food courts, which now even offers a Tropical Smoothie! This alone was a $4 million dollar renovation. It is actually the largest food court on the strip today.. . Our tower was renovated and new. The room was really quiet. We didn't have any issues with noise or cleanliness, which is actually more than I can say for some of the nicer hotels on the strip. We had a great view of the strip as well. after reading some of the reviews on here, I guess we lucked out.
I was so scared reading the reviews.  Not sure why people gave it 1 star.  I had an absolutely amazing time and I will definitely come back again.  I arrived around 1030am so I thought I was going to have to wait around till 3. Not at all. $20 for early check in?? heck yeah I'm in and I got a $20 food or drink credit. As I walked through the halls I was  a bit scared looking at the outdated decor. Oh My, when I Walked in, what a beauty.  Huge flat screen tv, ( forgot what channel it wad but they had done great information)nice view, plenty of space and clean room.  Oh, my bathroom was huge and bed was comfy with lots of pillows.  . . Pool- 5 decent size pools with 2 hot tubs to relax in.   what more can you ask for.  Chairs weren't the best but it worked.  They close at 7pm fyi.  There was a lot of garbage but that's bc us humans don't know how to pick up garbage and throw it away. So if its dirty, its bc YOU DID IT.  People would just leave the beer cans laying around.. . Casino- it was nice But didnt bring me any luck.  There was a starbucks located in the rear by the exit.  Go early since there was always a long line.  Make your way upstairs for some pretzels yogurt mcdonalds and much more.  . . My experience was a good one and the price was right.  Definitely can't b compare it to the bellagio, but it was a good,.smart choice for me.
I've been coming to vegas once or twice a year since I was 6 months old.  My grandfather purchased a condo out here which is now under my name 28 years later.  I've always been a fan of the Excalibur and always wanted to stay in a vegas hotel.. . My fiance said I should stay in a hotel so I can experience a true tourist vegas lifestyle.  Hands down I agreed and decided to stay at the Excalibur.  . . Let's start with WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIIFE!    . . I requested early check in since I drive from SoCal at 6am to get here.  When making the reservation the lady said they could probably get me in one hour early w/o the early room fee.  I was find with that and booked the room.  I get to the front desk around 10am just to ask about it.  The Lady at the front desk was RUDE, cut me off and didn't even attempt to listen to what I was trying to say.  She told me the Excalibur NEVER checks ANYONE in before 3pm without the fee.  My fiance and I decided to check out bags and just walk around.  1pm comes around and we are walking past the front desk to see a long line.  We ask an employee to ask if they are checking people in now and the man saidyes.  He said they do check people in early.  Now i'm upset because the RUDE woman said they NEVER check people in before 3.   So I finish what I was doing, get my bags and check in at 2:30ish.  The doors for the rooms are around an inch off the floor.  I can hear everything going on outside my room and I'm sure people can hear what's happening in my room.  I call the front desk to ask a simple question (where is the ice machine).  The lady was very rude and tried to get me off the phone.  . Another thing I hated about this hotel was all the agents trying to get me to sign up for a timeshare.  I couldn't want 3 minutes without being harrassed.  . . I was supposed to stay 5 nights here but I can't handle the quality and the rude employees.  I called from desk to request next day check out and then I called to make reservations at the Paris Hotel.  I will never stay here again.  This hotel only got two stars because I like the Medieval style.
Stayed here just this past weekend for two nights . The price is decent, i guess for a hotel on the strip. Needs a little renovation. I liked how the security checks your card key before entering the elevator. Make sure you belong and aren't an intruder .Very comfy beds and fluffy pillows.  Overall , i liked it .
You get what you pay for. In my books this place deserves 5 stars because it is cheap. If it were to cost me 150 a night to stay here it would not deserve 5 stars. I have stayed here 5 or 6 times. I come to vegas to gamble and party cheap rooms means more money to spend elsewhere. Being on the strip it also has great location! Thankyou excaliber I will most likly be seeing you again soon!
The Excalibur is good for an upgraded premium room, the other rooms really show their age. The casino and pool area are both large, well maintained and fun. The buffet however i would run from if i were you....seriously its THAT bad! Dicks last resort, however is worth checking out. The bars in the casino are very expensive, but you're on the strip what do you want? The pool is worth mentioning again because it really is very nice....the hot tub feels like youre sitting in a small box in the middle of the pool deck.
Oh Excalibur...your castle exterior is quite quirky but we didn't exactly get the royal treatment inside. . . Came here with a few girlfriends for a long weekend of bachelorette/birthday festivities. Since our bridal friend & family was already staying at this hotel, the rest of my girlfriends booked a room here as well (we split one room w/ 2 queen beds b/w us 4 girls). We ended up in Tower 1.. . The perks: . + Large beds. + Plenty of towels & bedding upon request. + Decent pricing. + Strong AC. . Things to note:. - No free wifi! Only an ethernet hookup (booooo). - Thin walls. - No food amenities/vouchers with booking. - Rather far from other destinations on The Strip. - Not enough wall outlets. - QUESTIONABLE CLEANING...found some sticky pieces of caramel popcorn between my sheets...gross!. . Bottom line -- if you're on a budget, Excalibur can be an acceptable deal. But you must remember to factor in cab fares & driving through traffic if you want to check out other places on The Strip. There are limited amenities here, but this hotel may work out if you just need an affordable place to crash during your time in Vegas.
Not a fan. I knew going in that it wasn't going to be luxury from the price but it really was not enjoyable to stay there. The room was standard, but the bed was super uncomfortable with no comforter, just a sheet that felt like a curtain and we had a view of the roof. The room reminded me of my Grandma's house. I tried the $20 trick and it did not work! Ha I put $20 in between my credit card and ID and asked if there were any complimentary upgrades available. The man said well you can upgrade your room for a fee and then handed my $20 back and said I could give him that as a tip afterwards. So I said no thanks. Also, there is someone trying to sell you something every 30 feet! It became unbearable to simply walk in and out of the hotel! And our $20 drink and food credit was only available to use at the bar or the incredibly overpriced steakhouse. There's also no wifi anywhere! What kind of a Vegas hotel doesn't have wifi in 2014! Overall, just a bad experience.
I have yet to stay here, I stayed across the bridge at the Luxor Hotel & Casino. But I'm here to review Excalibur Just by spending time in the Hotel/casino. When you first walk in to the hotel/Casino you get a overwhelming smell of smoke, which is obviously what to expect in a casino. .BUT it was extremely hard to breather, it was very stuffy. They need more ventilation. The selection of gambling choices is very nice, better than the Luxor I must say. && for FOOD there is a huge selection of different foods to choose from. I probably would not stay here though, due to the fact I had a hard time Breathing.
YELP! I really wish I could give 2.5 stars on this one. Let me start by saying that for the time period I was staying for work. Previous years for the same trip I had stayed at the Luxor (feel free to check out my review of that dump) but this year the Luxor was about $200 more than the Excalibur... so I had no choice. I have stayed at 5 various Vegas hotels and the clientele here is... interesting... dirty... smokey... not my type. Some great people watching for sure - but where in Vegas isn't!?. . Of all the casinos I've stayed in, walked through, gambled at... this was the smokiest I'd ever encountered. Grossed me out. Thankfully I got a non smoking room and the rooms were QUIET! This was a welcome surprise considering the walls were so thin at the Luxor I could hear EVERYTHING going on in the neighbors place. I got stuck with a 2 queen room rather than a king, so that was also a bummer. Oh and the view...or lack of a view I guess. I was looking right out into the rooftop airconditioning units. there was an old beat up chair on the rooftop that moved every night. I started to wonder if they were filming the next installment of the Hangover there. . . Mostly everything in the hotel is outdated (rooms, games, carpet) and not anything that truly appealed to me restaurant wise. I did spend time at the pool which was fine. It was day 2 of pool season so might have been cold for some people but I was ready to feel some sun after a harsh midwest winter so I enjoyed a beer or 3 out there. . . Overall though, I mean, I got decent sleep, the hotel was easy to navigate, the staff was nice when I encountered them and I had no true problems, so I can't give less than 3 stars on this one.
I had stayed at the Excalibur from 5/13/14-5/19/14 and everything was great. I had booked it for the great price but was somewhat hesitant due to bad reviews. I had gone to check in around 5-5:30 and had a wonderful customer service experience with a young man named Alex. (***Management please note***: I had asked him for a last initial to give him the credit he deserves - I review everywhere I go - but wouldn't give it to me and stated that was not necessary he just wanted me to be happy. Please give him credit if possible for doing a fantastic job!!) He was beyond friendly and made sure that I had everything that I had asked for accommodation wise!!!. To make this review easier here is a list of them at this hotel:. . Room- We had stayed in a tower 2 room which was very nice (I did not see the tower 1 rooms during my stay so I cannot comment on them). Clean, comfortable beds (a little firm but did not bother me.) Stand up shower - no tub. No problem whatsoever with the room. I wish they had a fridge/full length mirror but other wise no complaints.. . Pool- Very nice. Much nicer than most other Vegas hotels I've stayed at. I was always able to find a seat and they played good music.. . Restaurants- I did not eat at any sit down places here but not because I wouldn't but because I prefer to spend my money on other things than restaurants. I had ate at Baja Fresh a few times and it was excellent. They also have a "mall like" food court located upstairs that has several options. I did have a drink at Buca di Beppo (italian sit down) where the food looked delicious from what I saw.. . Casino- A bit dated compared to others but suitable. I'm not much of a gambler though except a few slots here. Also I noticed in quite a few reviews that everyone had complaints about the "smell" in the casino. While I did notice this smell it was no more overbearing than any other time you walk into a casino/hotel that has a particular scent. Unnoticeable by the time you kept walking in further.. . Employees- Every one was always very friendly from check in to bell hop to maintenance to bartenders to pool staff.to when I was checking out.. . Location- South end of strip but still walking distance to all. I've usually stayed more center strip but didn't have any complaints. Easy pedestrian access to NYNY & MGM. Free tram to Luxor & Mandalay Bay along with indoor walkways.. . I had also seen Thunder from down under (which I will review seperately) but had a great time. Definitely worth it if you're looking for a fun, easy, girls night out and you've never seen it before.. . All in all I will definitely return to the Excalibur, between the excellent customer service to it being the cheapest resort hotel on the strip, I have no complaints!!!
My husband and I were just there over the Memorial day Weekend.... was the worst experience..... we were put in a room looking a walls, and we were told it was an upgrade??? and the beds were harder than rocks..... The hotel was noisy and not very clean..... and the people that try to get you to do the shows..... they are the most unprofessional dishonest people . They should not be there they are really running people away.... as far as playing your machines the waitresses were no where to be found.... We did have a great time in Vegas however we will NEVER return to the Excalibur.........
Was at the Excalibur for Memorial day weekend (5 days total). Check in easy enough, however we were told we were getting a free upgrade! Lol carpet stained, smelled bad, beds were hard as rocks! Could have sworn it was a box spring. Sheets and pillows were filthy stained as well as the towels.  View was of the roof. Staff still enters room with privacy tag up to change linens with more stained linens. And no wi-fi had to hit up starbucks to get a signal. Who doesn't have wi-fi? Everywhere else had wi-fi.. .     Leavin tower every day we were harassed by people trying to sell time shares and dicount show tickets that were crap. (They say free but they are not.) Big scam. Every day it was same people and same pitch. Unrelenting. .      We did breakfast buffet,  unimpressive. And way overpriced. Had upset stomach the entire day after eating that food. It was all bland. Would have been better off eating mcdonalds every day. .     .      Gambling in Excalibur cocktail waitresses we're non existent,  but when you got one they were abrasive and by comparison of the other casinos very old and unattractive and rude to match. . .      The large pool was closed all but one day! But they kept the adult pool that you have to pay $10+ to get into open with 3 patrons (4 lifeguards). I would say bad idea. Drinks were super expensive bring at least $40 cash with you to drink at the pool. . .      I will probably never stay at the Excalibur again it is out dated and under staffed to keep up on the hotel and casino. This will contribute to further deterioration of the casino. (Resort fee?) Ha what resort? Small uprade to motel 6 but with a casino inside.
