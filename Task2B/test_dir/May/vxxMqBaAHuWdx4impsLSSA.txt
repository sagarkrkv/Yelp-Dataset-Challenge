Used to be best in Las Vegas but quality and taste has gone way down. Make Cesar's look like a deal. Friday-Sunday dinner is $40 Caesar's is $50 with a lot more choices and better tasting food. ..  I won't be back
Paid $40 and I only ate $20 worth lol. Ok so I don't eat too much normally but I know how to go HAM at buffets... . Let's start with what I remember:. -sushi: gross don't even try it. Taste worse than costco sushi. . -egg rolls: how the hell do you mess up egg    rolls? They tasted so old and bitter, yuck. -crab legs, oysters, and shrimp: delish. -ceviche: ehh no, just no. . . -The Italian stuff was on point tho! You can't fuck up Italian food.. . Desserts:. Gelato- pretty bomb. Cheesecake-good!. Fruit tart in a cup- 5/5 stars, delicious !. Green cookie- yum!. . Mimosas! All drinks are free, just tip!. . All in all, I wouldn't be back, too expensive and not enough quality.
When we first moved to Vegas in late 2011, we were obsessed with the Studio B buffet! We would bring anyone who visited us here and pretty much any excuse to come. Even until now this is our all-time favorite buffet place, ever!! They offer unlimited free beer and wine, although I'm always too full to really take advantage. On certain nights they offer crab legs. Their prime rib is THE BOMB, as well as everything else! The sushi is decent even though there isn't too big of a selection. The workers are usually good about refilling the food right away so you're never standing around waiting. It is a bit pricey but SO WORTH it! You won't get a nasty stomachache like you might get from other places... You'll just be extremely full! Oh, and the desserts are sooooo good too! . . I recommend this buffet to anyone and everyone out there!
Food was better when they first opened.  But since then, food has been going downhill. But I do love the wine. My parents always go here when they're in town because we live like 5 minutes away. Love the differant salads and there is always something for everyone. U always have to save room for dessert though.
Free alcohol! For the crab legs, they will cut it for you. Sushi is a little dry and small. The rice is also too dry. Their dessert is the best among wynn and wicked spoon. There aren't many creative dishes as wicked spoon but they offer many choices.
I personally believe this is the best buffet in Las Vegas. Fresh foods Great selection of beer and wines. They have great staff and the wait lines are fast as well. lots of food to choose from and also you can see the chef cooking so thats a plus.
Went at 6:30pm for a Friend's Birthday! The food was horrible. I've been here before with out of town family and the food was good. This time the food was dried out, a lot of the bowls were empty. I would ask how much longer and the chef just kept saying it's coming out I waited 10mins I had a glass of ciders while I waited. The only plus is that they have a really good free bottemless house cider.
Best buffet ever! All you can eat crab legs,. Shrimp, prime rib, steaks AND the include alcohol!. . What else can you want? Perfect way to end an awesome Vegas weekend.
Studio B did satisfy every craving I had from BBQ to seafood (delicious) and they provide FREE beer and wine for dinner. However, their line is ridiculous. Not because of the alcohol, but because their dining room is small. My family and I waited in line for about 3 hours to be seated. We do not have to wait this long in the other buffets on the strip. Each time we attempted to give up and leave, the line started moving, so we decided to stay. There are 3 lines after you pay. 1 is for VIP, 1 is for parties of 5 or more, and the other is for 4 or less. My advice is to keep track of the groups around you because people like to take advantage of the line just to be seated asap. Parties of 3 were in the 5 or more line and were going to be seated before us (party of also 3) and we were there before them. My mother was livid and blew up on the seating hostess because they are not paying attention to the amount of people in the proper lines. We were sat before the other party of 3, but still! How many other parties did they do that to?? I do not recommend Studio B if you are starving because the wait will make everything worse.
Decent buffet place. Stopped by on our trip back home from Vegas. Food is all right , but not in the vicinity of the Vegas big boys.
Best buffet in Vegas! They have a huge variety of entrees and different types of food! The view, the ambiance, the decor is what makes its AWESOME, and the dessert tops it off. The dessert is what makes the buffet so unique.
Seafood buffet is offered during the weekends (Fri, Sat & Sun) for $39.99 which also includes beer and wine. There are lots of different varieties of food, but I came for the seafood so that's all I tried.. . The oysters on the half shell were disappointing. They were stacked on top of each other in a huge pile over ice so bits of grit and shell were mixed into the oysters. . . The crab legs were split open for easy eating and served over ice. They weren't salted enough during cooking so they were a bit bland. . . Baked mussels tasted spoiled, but the steamed mussels were good.. . Pili-pili shrimp was cooked well and  the sauce was tasty.. . Clams and salmon were decent. Fried shrimp tempura was crispy and good. . . The buffet also had Prime rib which was well seasoned and delicious. Served with au jus and horseradish cream sauce, yummy!. . All the deserts were sooooo good. Little bite sized pieces of everything were perfect after stuffing myself with all that seafood.
Came here cuz I heard all the rage about this place. I must say it was just OK... The line wasn't even that long, well inside the setup barricades, but I had to wait 2 hours!!! When we were seated I want to say at least 50% of the tables were still open... that is so ridiculous! The food was decent, but nothing blew my mind. I did like that beer on tap was included with your meal price, Over all, good bang for your buck.
Flies flying around ... Flies inside the salt shaker... And the food not replenished as used to be... It's Friday night dinner most exp$$$$ and when they add the crab legs . They would drop on top of the new batch the left over from the previous badge ( non edible )...----taste and quality way less then used to be .... What a disappointment
