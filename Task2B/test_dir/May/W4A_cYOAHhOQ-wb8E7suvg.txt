Amazing show!!
The most exotic experience I had in Las Vegas. There were moments when I felt I was in heaven. Great mix of circus de soleil and musical. If you are into broadway shows, you don't want to miss this one :)
First off, 5 stars for the athletes who make the show special. Their fetes of strength are outstanding as well as the acrobatics. The stage and settings are beautiful and fascinating. Again 5 stars. The drawback for me, I'm 6'2, was the severe lack of leg room even though the seats were very plush and comfortable. The lack of cup holders also seems odd as they sell beer and drinks in cups.. I highly recommend and feel it's one of those must see Vegas shows.
This show has it all. A must see in Vegas!!! We sat in VIP where they have small tv screens near your feet that show you shots of backstage and underwater live. It could be distracting if it's your first time seeing the show but I found it wonderfully insightful. VIP seats or not this show is great!!!
Omg where do I start this show was extraordinary I was in aww with the things they did and high they jumped it had a wonderfull story and the seats were great everywhere I think since it's a 360 theatre it had water fire and wind it's a must see
Show was incredible! We've seen O and mystere and liked this just as much! The performers, costumes and stage are amazing!! There's not a bad seat in the house. We spent a little more and sat in the VIP section at the top and loved it. The seats are bigger with a lot more leg room, and you get a waitress. We would definitely recommend the show!
The talent of the performers dancing on the stage in the water, diving from the platform or from elevated positions or the gymnastic wonders that took place throughout the performance was impressive. . . Like some others, I did not know the story of the performance, found trying to track the ideas challenging and did not care for much of the music.  But the talent of the cast, the feats of strength and coordination they displayed and the staging and special effects were captivating and despite my ongoing questions about what was the message or story, I was trulyawed. . . I think it would be wonderful if the production included some form of intro narration to lead the audience into understanding concepts that will be presented.  They provided a free program; but I had neither my glasses nor light to use it during the show.. . I recommend the show.  Read up on it before you go and then you will not be distracted by trying to figure the story line and you can simply be amazed by the  finesse, the grace, the endurance and strength of each of the performers!
What a fantastic show. I loved that it focused on the physical talent and the choreography of the performers and creative staff and was light on the cheesy costumes that pervade so many other of these cirque type shows. This show simply featured beautiful bodies doing super human acrobatic and water feats. It is a great show and I would go see it again. The combination of the synchronized swimming and high acrobatics was thrilling to watch.
