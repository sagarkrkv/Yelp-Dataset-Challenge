Fantastic little hot pocket. I really love the crust and the stuffing inside. I have ordered a few and I think my favorite is the one with the steak. Forgot what it was called. But u can't go wrong. It's delicious! Don't be fooled by the entrance. Once u go inside. It's like another world.
Awesome place. I tend to stick to the more basic and traditional style pasties now, as the more unique ones just seem a little odd to me. I can't say I've ever had anything I didn't like though. Great beer selection as well.
We've been here a few times now & the pasty's have been kind of hit or miss. Each time we've tried sometime different to change it up. The chicken portobello mushroom & the curry chicken were pretty good whereas the rosemary chicken & the lamb and mint weren't all that great. I was told no substitutions can be made (nor can anything be eliminated) because the pasty's are already made. I guess that kind of goes against my personal preference. The atmosphere at the restaurant is very laid back & it's a good place to go with a group. It's definitely unique which is one of the reasons we keep going back!
Food is the same but this location has greatly expanded.  Although it still gets crowded sometimes, you can now come at 6:00 on weekdays and probably get a seat.  I was a bit concerned however about the outside area which is poorly maintained and dirty.   I know it's outside, but you can still clean tables get the splinters out of the wooden seating.  Are the portions a bit smaller?  If so, all to the good.. . This still has a college handout ambiance but most of the patrons are not college students, so perhaps Cornish Pasty could encourage their servers to dress just a bit nicer and act a bit nicer.
The chicken tikka masala pasty is great. The ambience and every thing is excellent. You can also try chicken pot pie here
This is one of my favorite restaurants in AZ, and a great place to come with friends for great food and beer. The best pasty is the chicken pot pie, it's to die for! And the staff are all friendly and efficient. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are large, so we always have leftovers to take home. Cornish is the best!!
Best place in tempe
So my friends from ASU had mentioned this Irish pub place that served what was called a "Pasty". From the sound of things, it was a hot pocket/pie sandwich type deal. They mentioned an array of options from pepperoni to peppered steak etc. All that being said, decided we should go there for dinner the night before I left Arizona. Especially after I saw 860 reviews with 4.5 stars up here on yelp. That's virtually unreal. Never had seen such ratings with as many reviews. Any who, drove up to what looked like a dead shopping strip with a bunch of stores/restaurants that looked closed due to the dark tint of the windows. When we opened the door though, it was actually pretty mind blowing. Walked around from what I guess was the front door to the bar side. Honestly, first thing I thought coming around that corner was that this place looked like something off the set of man vs food. Can't really explain it but if you're familiar with the show and happen to make a stop, you'll understand what I'm saying. So we sat at the bar and got our orders. I wanted something spicy so I looked out for something that I thought would match my liking on the menu. Found the Cajun chicken pasty which was spicy marinated chicken, ham, bacon, with chipotle sauce. My girlfriend ordered the bangers mash which was mashed potatoes, meatloaf and gravy. My Cajun chicken was amazing. Spiced to perfection as was hoping. My girlfriends bangers mash was ok. Not as much flavor as my Cajun chicken but still pretty good. All in all, I would highly recommend this place. It definitely lives up to the 860 reviews and 4.5 stars, a rare occurrence. Only mishap, which really isn't a mishap, is that if you decide you want to add any custom pieces together in your pasty, we were told you would have to make such request 24hrs in advance. These guys make the sandwiches hours in advance so that it's just put into the oven upon order. So if you're the type to want to customize your order, I suggest you call in advance but you likely won't make the a wrong decision with any of the available options.
So I love this place, been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about it. Great food, great beers amazing, personal service and I never wanted to go anywhere else for my afternoon beers and food. Recently, however, they have formed a new policy where there is no smoking on the patio area, fully outside, ventialted patio. I do not smoke, never have never will, but that idea is ridiculous. If you want to go to a non smoking family style restaurant, and there is an applebees in every town in america period. If you want a fun, hip atmosphere with the product and staff to back it up, you come to the Cornish pasty and if smoke bothers you, you stay indoors and thats that. Dear pasty: dont give in to these high horse, internet terrorists. Your fan base loves you and will stay true. Go corporate like.everyone else, fine, someone else will be more than willing to stay local and real.
Mmmm mmmm DELICIOUS! I had the carne adovada pasty and the BF had the cajun chicken pasty. We were both in love! Stuffed with meaty awesomeness! Fresh ingredients and fresh out of the oven. They are cut in half and one should probably eat the other half as a midnight snack or meal the next day, but why stop when it's just so darn good!? The oven chips and other potato option was also amazing! Great outdoor area with giant tables. Lovely beer list. Friendly service. Can't wait to go back!
Say it with me... PASS - TEE.  These do not go on your nips.  They are delicious pastries stuffed with meat and cheese and all manner of amazing things.  It's also one of the few places in phoenix where you can order a draft Boddingtons to wash it all down.  I like sitting at the bar and watching them make the pasties while you drink and eat.
Love Cornish Pasty. First time at this location. . . Our well mustachioed server was very quick with drinks and very attentive to our questions. . . We had the mushroom walnut soup to start. Piping hot and very flavorful. I liked the crunch from the walnuts and the bread was really fresh. . .  Lovely Bit of Salmon and the Reuben. Both very good. And still our favorites. Our server also brought out dessert very fast, as requested. Very great meal. . . Non-smoking patio was a plus. There was a lot of out door heaters ready for colder nights too.
This place is ALWAYS GOOD! Haven't had a pasty I've been disappointed with so far! My favorite is the chicken portobello ! Their oven chips and meatballs for appetizers are great as well! The pastys and made and baked fresh, so it can take a little time to get your food, but it is so worth the wait! Great prices on alcohol! And their desserts are SO good!! My fave is the chocolate bread pudding! A MUST everytime we good!      The only con is the staff/service ! Sometimes we get great servers that are very attentive and keep our drinks filled.. Other times it takes forever to see our server and to get the bill to pay!
The food here is all right, the atmosphere better.. . The lady and I got a couple of pasties, the shepherd's pie one and the cheese steak deal; they were okay, kinda bland, but hard to dislike something in a pie shell.. . The atmosphere was about perfect for what you'd expect a British pub-type place to be. Dark, with lots of gregarious riff-raff and guys with beards about. Probably doesn't sound too appealing, but I found the authenticity to be nice.
