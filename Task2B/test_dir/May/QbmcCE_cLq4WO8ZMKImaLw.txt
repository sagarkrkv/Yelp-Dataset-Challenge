Alright, so here's the deal with this place. My husband and I have a hard time finding restaurants that will please us both. I am. More of a foodie. He hates anything pretentious with small servings. This place is our happy medium. Good food , LARGE servings and a hipster ambience. Love the one in San Diego. Vegas location has a totally different vibe...kinda trashy and in a crappy casino. Food was still good though.
Waited 45min for a table with half the place empty and then when finally sat no one came to our table for 20 min plus....we had to get up and leave! Really if you are too busy and under staffed just say so and don't waste my time!
Very good food made from scratch... And man do they sure give you a ton of it!  The menu had so many options, it was really hard to decide.  The servers were very friendly and attentive.  Breakfast hit the spot and I saw a handful of items on the menu I still want to try, so I'm going to attempt to get back here again soon!
Diverse menu, friendly staff and busy atmosphere.. . Go early, if party of two, sit at the bar - lots of good small talk and action going on. As well as delicious bloody mary's (they make their own mix and it shows).. . Get the sage-fried chicken and whatever, this is the best, most moist chicken. Food portions are large and overeating is easy to achieve here.. . It's crowded because it's an affordable and delicious breakfast spot. Get a bloody mary while you wait!
Food was over hyped and nothing special.  THE WAITRESS STOLE MY CARD AND FORGED MY SIGNATURE AND CHARGED MY CARD FOUR TIMES!! After speaking with management they acted like they didn't care and would not even comp a drink or meal for my troubles.
Excellent Brunch in Vegas. . You won't be leaving here hungry, the portions are massive. With prices ranging from $10-$20 you definitely get your moneys worth. The food is delicious and the service is excellent. While they don't have any omlettes on the menu (what I was planning to order) they more than made up for it with their scramble style plates. I had a avacado, onion, bacon, and swiss scramble which consisted of the aforementioned ingredients with approximately 4 eggs scrambled into a delicious cheesy egg mixture. This included a side of fried potatoes, fruit, and a delicious biscuit. Overall it really hit the spot and I didn't leave feeling terrible about myself. . . However, some of the other items people ordered were absolutely too big. A huge mount of eggs, cheese, meats, and gravy, over a biscuit... at least 2-3 times the size of the entree I ordered. While this was amazing it made me sick just thinking about eating it. So I would recommend ordering a smaller entree if you plan on moving the rest of the day. . . Overall, a great experience well deserving of the current 4 star status.
My wife and I just went to Vegas for a quick getaway.  We were staying at The Quad (formerly Imperial Palace), and we went here four times during our stay.  The first time, we went for brunch and both ordered a meal.  The blueberry pancake was the size of a steering wheel!  My wife got the chicken and waffles.  The portions are enormous, but worth it.  The prices are great for the portions that you get.  The next time we ordered sandwiches thinking we could eat half of it and save it for later, which worked.  The next two times, we split a starter and a meal.  It worked out real well.  Especially since my wife is an employee of The Quad's parent company, so she gets a discount!  I would highly recommend anyone that is going to Vegas, regardless of where you're staying, to check out this restaurant.  Well worth the time and money.  Great service by all the servers we had.  Julien, Al, and Rochelle were fantastic!  Thank you for making our stay at The Quad much more enjoyable!
I came here yesterday after a great weekend celebrating a friend's bachelor party. With 4 of us left, it only took about 20 mins to get a table.. . The portions here are huge and the prices to match. If you don't want to leave in a stretcher or get a doggie bag, I would recommend sharing a plate. Two of my friends go the chicken and waffles, which were 2 giant chicken breasts with 4 bacon waffles. and we're not talking fluffy light waffles, we're talking batter dense waffles. I got the Chicken, potatoes, eggs, and bacon with a biscuit.  that was also very good.  the chicken has a great seasoning on it and lots of moisture, especially for the breast meat. potatoes had (I think) grilled mozzerella in them, which was cool.  The biscuit was surprisingly a little on the dry chalky side, but they had some nice jam and butter to help that.. . If the portions were smaller and prices lower to match, it would definitely be 5 stars, but the portions and prices were just a little to ridiculous for me. But I guess that's Vegas? or maybe the expanding waistline of America.
Really really big servings, so make sure you come hungry. . . Service can be a little slow, but maybe that's how they work up your appetite. . . I got the fried chicken salad (yup I'm an oxymoron), omg the fried chicken was the best I've ever had.  I'm usually not a fan of fried chicken breast, but man this place prepared it so tender and juicy I'm drooling just thinking about it again. . . The fiance got the grilled chicken hash which looked really good, but again, huge!. . Other things ordered at my table were the sage chicken and waffle, the cornbread, a scramble, and a hash with sausage and asparagus... Everyone left happy :)
After getting so drunk at the Flamingo pool the day before, getting escorted out by security (nice guys btw), and then passing out the rest of the day, I was in need of some serious breakfast the next morning. After reading many positive reviews on this place, we have it a try and I'm so glad we did! The food came out in epic proportion! The servings were HUGE and tasted great (my opinion may be slightly swayed by the fact I hadn't eaten in almost 24 hrs but still). The service was excellent and the pricing fair for what we received. Great breakfast spot!
Delicious! Staff is friendly, coffee and food are delicious, and the portions are huge. That's my only gripe - I had to stop myself from cleaning my plate of eggs, potatoes, biscuit, and fruit or I'd have exploded. . . Service and quality was far superior to that of the hotel next door, where I stayed.
Amazing breakfast! . Went in for a very late breakfast on a Wednesday about 2pm. I ordered the French toast. My husband ordered the eggs, bacon and a pancake the size of a hubcap. My French toast was amazing. Pecan nuts and banana. To die for. Best French toast I've ever had. We got seated right away and our sever was very friendly. We never had empty glasses. Next time I visit vegas I will definitely get the French toast again.
We had a decent wait for Sunday brunch--- but it was absolutely worth it!  It was fun to  look at all the celebrity photos and what they ordered in the waiting area in the mean time. . . Once we were seated--- it seemed busy with a lot of hustle and bustle and typical diner booths.   We went with the chicken and waffles based on reviews, and I have to say-- they were the best we've ever ordered!!! Will definitely return here.
Chicken and waffles!  I was so excited to try this place out after seeing it on tv. It is inside the Quad ( formerly the imperial palace).  Go all the way to the back, away from the strip entrance.  There is a escalator with signage.  No wait at 8 am on Wednesday.  Plenty is seating booths and tables.   They are open 24/7 with a full service bar. The portions are ridiculous.  Definitely enough for two meals.  It was so good.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful.  The waffles had a hint of vanilla with bacon cooked right in.  Is it better than Roscoe's in L.A. ? No.  But , it is legit. My only criticizim is not enough syrup.  Definitely ask for extra right off the bat.  Our server was great and attentive.  He even offered to give us to go cups for our coffee. I look forward to coming back next trip.  P. S.  I brought the leftovers with me on the plane.  Too good to waste.
This restaurant is amazing. Expect to do a little waiting because it was packed in the morning. However, the wait time was only 15 minutes for my group of 4 people. I ordered the waffles and they were great but the portion was so huge that I could only eat a quarter of my plate. My friends got the flapper jacks in the banana flavor and that was so good. It was a perfect balance of soft, crunchy and sweet. I would expect everything on this menu to be delicious and when I go back to vegas, I know I'll be coming back here again!
I highly recommend going here for breakfast! My husband and I stayed at Caesars and didn't like there options for breakfast. We searched yelp and it came up for a hot breakfast spot. It is about a ten minute walk from Caesars  and worth it! We had the French toast, eggs, bacon, home fries and biscuits! Yum yum yum!
My wife and I had the salmon and asparagus eggs Benedict and the Dave's chicken Benedict and we were very disappointed.   The servings were huge but sometimes less is more.   I don't write many negative reviews but I don't see what everyone is ravings about.  Our bill was $57 with coffee, two breakfasts and one bloody Mary.  I'm sorry but wouldn't eat there again.  McDonald's actually sounded good after that meal.
Had dinner with my four sisters from out of town, on 4/27/14. Entrees included the Meatloaf, Chicken Alfredo, Chicken Skillet, Guacamole Chicken Salad, and a Corned Beef Reuben. All the meals came luke warm, closer to cold. Food was lacking in flavor. I have not heard one positive thing from my sisters about that meal. So I guess you could say it was a night to forget. Definitely do not recommend this place for anyone with a discerning palate. Also, the food came fast, like it was already plated and then barely warmed up. The waiter then more or less disappeared, had no knowledge of what he was trying to sell us. Acted more or less, like he could care less about our dining experience. This was my call since I am the local. So it is my fault for not researching further.
The food for brunch is good. I had the chicken with eggs and bacon. It was different and very good. Huge portion, absolutely huge. Service was great, solid place to try once for brunch or lunch
Quality of food has dramatically gone down. Been here 2 times in the last 3 months and was deeply dissapointed...have in mind that you make line for an hour and then another 45-60 mins for the food. They wont quote that when you give your name. And sadly you cant get any appetizers or any food because they go in order of ticket. Wint be back.
Came here last month for brunch with my friends on a Sunday morning and our wait was an hour long.. . We didn't know how big the portions were, so when we got our food we were in shock. One of my friends and I got the Andy Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and two of my other friends got the original Sage Fried Chicken. If we knew how big the portions were, I think we would have just shared. Yea, not sure what I was thinking, I had this place bookmarked (SD location), i should have read the reviews right before going in. Oh well.... . I also tried their spike kiwi watermelon lemonade drink, it was so yummy yum-yum! Knowing this place is open 24/7, It is a good place to go after clubbing and drinking all night. . . This place is known to have a long wait, so it's best to come early morning. Also, they get so busy that the service is really slow. It took us a while to get our drinks... overall experience I would come back here and try something different and share with someone.
I was disappointed overall, especially given the rave reviews. Maybe we just came on a bad night.. . Pros. -Staff was nice. -Beautiful, fantastic presentation of food. -Freshly squeezed tangerine juice  and lemonade good. . Cons. -I got crab cakes, and there wasn't enough crab in it. It was mostly bread. Even though it was savory, there was no crab or seafood taste at all, and no chunks of crab at all. Disappointing for its steeper price of 24.99.. -My husband got the chicken and waffles. The skin was crispy and the food beautifully plated. However, it was very bland. The syrup was not sweet enough, the chicken not flavorful, nor the waffle exceptionally freshly warm or tasty or freshly slightly crispy on outside. It was cold and very ordinary tasting. In chicken and waffles, not all 3 elements can be bland and ordinary. One must be more stronger or flavorful, either a sweeter syrup, or a well flavored and marinated chicken, or a great waffle. It is possible for the other 2 elements to be ordinary if one element is done well. It was bland. To top it off, the chicken still had its bone. I usually don't mind, but on top of everything, another minus. . . Overall, a disappointment, especially when the final bill for 2 of us came out to $69 for beautiful, but bland and ordinary tasting food.
this place is disgusting. the food is gross - both in terms of how much they give you and how it tastes. the windowless interior adds nothing to the experience. I don't know why anyone would give this more than one star. i would like to give it negative stars if i could. it's a house of gross gluttony.
Just awesome. Huge amounts of food, great people working there, great people watching. Great drinks. . While eating here I ordered the safe friend chicken Benedict. So good, it came with mashed potatoes, biscuits, bacon, eggs, friend chicken, tomato, and spinach. IT Was HUGE. next time I will get one and share. . The boyfriend had their pancakes, which was ok. Dense and eggy. But there syrup was very good. . . This is a place you just need to try! . . Oh and the drinks were awesome too.
Ok, so we went here on the recommendation of a travel website. Everyone raved about the large portions of good food. Well, they got the large portions right.  . If you like huge amounts of greasy, heavy food this is the place for you. My hubby and I like quality over quantity, so not really a good fit for us. Even the mimosas were not good.  . Add to that the fact that the waitress was almost non existent and we will not be back.
My go to restaurant for breakfast when I visit Vegas. Always good food, service and drinks too! I always order a scramble...one of these days I will venture out! But I love the griddled mashed potatoes and the biscuit it comes with. My friend enjoyed the french toast. You will leave here with your stomach very full and happy!
Went here last summer during a bachelor party. 4 strapping young men carbo loading for a 5 day grand canyon hike, we could not have asked for a better spot. There was a wait, but we got there early so it wasnt too bad. The hash skillets were great and andy's fried chicken benedict was also really good. Service is what you would expect from a jam packed brunch place serving the only decently priced breakfast in vegas. I took my Buffet loving dad here and he hasnt stopped talking about it since. Strongly recommended.
Everything the world needs to know about us fat Americans can be found at the Hash House A Go Go.  Vegas is a city of sin and this is Gluttony at it's finest.  Hash House describes their concept as Twisted Farm Food.  It's American comfort food taken out of it's overalls and dressed up.  I came here for one thing.....The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  I saw it on Man vs Food and knew someday it would have to be mine.. . So many times when a place "creates" a tower of food all combined together on a gargantuan plate, it's not well thought out.  This is different and the key here is each ingredient is great on it's own.  From the bottom up we have mashed potatoes, nicely seasoned and thrown on a griddle to get them slightly browned.  Then why stop with one starch when you can have two?  The mashed potatoes are topped with a couple of fluffy buttermilk biscuits that are some of the most tasty I've ever had.  Followed by fresh spinach (it's great that they don't cook it so it doesn't get mushy) and slices of Red Beefsteak Tomato.  This is topped with a couple of slices of hickory smoked bacon and then it's namesake....A half pound well seasoned fried chicken breast.  Corn flakes are used as the batter and it keeps it's crunch well.  Top this with scrambled eggs and cheese.  The cheese is fried up on the griddle so it's melted prior to going on everything else.  This also creates a nice browned skin to the melted cheese.  I forgot to ask what cheese they were using, but it wasn't too strong.  It seemed it's main job was bond itself to the chipotle cream sauce that is poured on top and create one cheesy gooey chipotle sauce that seals everything in.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!  I hope they never open a Hash House near me because I could see myself craving one of these life ending creations often.  5 Stars all the way.. The masterpiece... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#4MG6MmBLXIl1kwp_ucw3kg. . And here's a nice cross section of it to fully appreciate all it's glory...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#50iLIS2poMhauloTh8so2w. . I also got a chance to try the Big O' Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin Sandwich.  We all agreed while impressive to look at, it wasn't on the same level as Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  It was a tasty deep fried pork cutlet but I found it needing more than just the sprinkling of ketchup on it as it got a little dry.  I did love the pickles as the vinegar flavor worked well with the pork.  Perhaps some kind of creamy BBQ sauce would have been better.  The bun was a whole wheat bun, but was a throw away here.  Why whole wheat?  I have no idea.  3.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#sMJihbRjw3f9nOLeumyMPQ. . My wife for some reason got the most boring burger on the menu.  As such I found myself saying....just a burger.  Their burgers are two half pound patties stuffed with a few different options.  Well it doesn't seem that they are really "stuffed" just things are put between the 2 burgers.  She got bacon, cheddar, and avocado.  So to me it was just how they layered everything, big deal the bacon, cheddar, and avocado was between two separate patties.  There was also no sauce?  Just ketchup.  We asked for some mayo, so it wasn't so dry, but this place should really come up with their own sauce.  If you want a burger, there are better more creative options in Vegas, such as Burger Bar or Bachi Burger.  3.5 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#hjjZMDOZjlfQE0GSgrp17A. . I'm sure there are other 5 star dishes here as I saw a lot of amazing looking things.  My daughter's plain pancake was one of the best I've ever tasted.  They do them all kinds of ways here.  Of course the pancake was the size of a medium pizza and a good 3/4 inch thick.  For sure I'm trying one of their hash dishes next time.  After all they are called Hash House.  The Meatloaf and Smoked Mozzarella Hash sounds great with a couple of over easy eggs on top.  I can recommend the banana latte.  It was excellent. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#V1jbFFDhdWldAaGeyBHHWg. . Expect at least a 20-30 minute wait as the word is out on this place.  They told us 45, but we were in in 20.  It's a huge restaurant and they move them in and out fairly well.  Open 24 hours!!!!
I arrived at 11 a.m. on a Monday and was able to avoid the 15 minute wait by sitting at the bar.  The food is cooked to order so it takes a while to get served, but it was a pleasure to have a seat with a/c that was not in front of a slot machine.  The bartenders were great and the food (chicken pot pie) was very heavy.  I need to go nap now.
The portions are hefty (man vs food), but also come with a flavor of fireworks. The brown sugar and banana flapjack, wowwww! The servers were pretty attentive, which is great because this place was packed, and for good reason. If you have a bite card, you get a discount here. Definitely will be back next time I'm in town.
I literally can't think of anything wrong with this establishment. From food, to customer service, to overall look andfeel of the restaurant, it definitely warrants 5 stars. . . Quality and quantity are the key words here. The portion sizes are fit for kings and queens. HUGE! My husband and I have yet to finish a full meal here. The waffles, chicken, pancakes, eggs, potatoes, french toast and many other dishes are so large that they could use their own individual plates! The meals are also vertical, literally. The food is piled on top of itself as you can see in many of the photos. The presentation and plating is stellar. As soon as you see your food, you're amazed! . . The quality of the food and seasonings are top notch. One of their little catch phrases is "twisted farm food", which definitely holds true. They even tell you when you order that everything is made to order, that they don't use any heat lamps, and that your food may come out in separate pieces and separate times. This is so awesome to me and ensures that my food is fresh. Even the juice is fresh squeezed when you order it, so it may take a few mins to arrive. . . The setup of the restaurant is really cool, roomy, kind of dark, and overall has a great vibe. We haven't had one bad customer service problem here. The wait staff is fantastic, and they all look genuinely happy to be working there. The main thing I noticed is that there are a million and one employees here. You see them zipping back and forth the whole time you're there. The staff is also VERY diverse as far as appearance and ethnicity. . . Be prepared for somewhat of a wait at this location. Eating at a restaurant such as Hash House A Go Go is definitely a priority for MANY people when they come to Vegas--myself included!
One star is being considerate....... . Went @ 5pm on a Saturday & sat @ the bar. Bartender was restocking the bar @ the other end & never greeted us. Whilewe waited patiently for her to come over, 4 people walked in wanting drinks to-go & she served them before even greeting us. I had to stop the Manager to take our drink order & food order after waiting about 10 minutes. . Only about 4 tables were occupied in the restaurant, yet it took about 40 minutes to get burgers for the 3 of us. The food was decent but customer service was horrible.
We had a favorable experience here. It was later in the night when we went and all my friends were drunk and obnoxious, so kudos to the staff at HHAGG to put up with drunken patrons night after night.. . I got their well know chicken and waffles. Its $15 -18 I think (can't remember) but its ginormous. They chicken was delicious but their waffle was a bit soft for my liking, but I have a preference for crispier waffles. The bacon inside the waffle was a nice surprise and I must say, was definitely the bonus in the meal. It is definitely a shareable plate and I would love to come back here again for it.. . If you haven't been, you must try.
If you don't mind getting a heart attack eat here! food is pretty amazing but the portions are HUGE! they place was pretty big and very busy so plan ahead for a bit of wait.
This is perfect breakfast to recover from an amazing night! They serve large portions of food and I was stuffed after finishing my meal. I highly recommend this place. I'd definitely come here next time I come to Vegas!
I did a search on Yelp last week about the best breakfast in Vegas and this place came up. Since it was located next door to my hotel we were eager to try it. . . Thursday morning - line out the door, so we skipped it. Saturday morning - line down the stairs, so we skipped it. Monday morning - line out the door, but decided to stay.  The line moved surprisingly quick. . . There were 4 of us at the table and the server was really great. I asked her what she recommended and she went through some things and gave great input. She even suggested that each couple could split a meal and there would be plenty of food to spare. . . But being the gluttons we are, we wanted to try many things so we each ordered something different. What ensued was maybe the best breakfast I've ever had. Everybody loved everything and there was indeed too much food, but it was worth it. . . I also feel it's one of the finer values on the Strip as far as cost. ~$15pp for the best breakfast you're likely to ever have is a bargain
Delicious food! Great portions of food.. . Cons - Had to wait 40 minutes to sit and another 40 minutes for the food but it was worth it. . We also had trouble finding the host stand with all the other people waiting.
must go stop in las vegas if you are a foodie! no need to writea long review just go that's it!
This place is amazeballs!!! The portions are HUGE so go hungry. The pancakes are bigger than the plate and if you're not pork eater like my husband and I, the chicken sausage is to die for. Be prepared for a little bit of a wait but once seated the service is pretty quick. Pics definitely will be visiting the Chicago location real soon!
The food was delicious. I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which was around the 13-20 $ range, I can't remember exactly. Portions were large and came out in a fairly decent amount of time. The only thing that ruined my experience was the rude redheaded host. We asked to be sat in a booth and she refused telling us that she absolutely could not. Now I could understand this if it was packed and busy, but it was 5 AM, and there was plenty of seating, not even half full!  I had to ask to speak to someone else and then we were seated 10 mins later in a booth. What really irritated me even further was that a party of three (same as ours) was seated in the booth in front of us by the redheaded host not even 5 mins later! I'm not sure if she was talked to by her managers. I shouldn't have to argue for a seat in a half empty restaurant.  . . I will return again to try some different dishes since the first dish I ordered was delicious. I heard the chicken a waffles are a must here. I hope next time I get a polite host! What good is a restaurant if the food is good and the service is terrible! Especially when it's the host, the first interaction I have when entering.
Food was amazing portions were great,  waiters were awesome only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the hostesses were very rude it's a very busy place so you'd expect them to be able to be professional and nice to there customers no matter what is going on
So the first time we tried come here, the line was out the door and down the stairs. An hour wait they said.... Nope.. . So we came later around 7 pm and there were maybe 3 other patrons. Which was great because we were on our way to a Vegas show after and we couldn't wait long.. . Anyways I ordered a mojito, fried green tomatoes and we split the Chicken and Waffles.. . The waiter was enthusiastic and I really liked him. I told him I didn't really enjoy the mojito and he was really cool about it. . . The fried green tomatoes were really beautifully delivered. They rate great too. But if I had a particular critique I'd say the batter the tomatoes in were flavorless and it kinda brought down the dish.. . The wait to get my main entree was insane. Especially since there were only 3 other customers. I mean how long does it take to throw some chicken in a skillet and put some waffles in a waffle maker? Not 45 minutes.. . But honestly the wait was worth it. Those sage chicken and waffles were amazing. Really.. Really... Amazing.. . So yeah. I'll come back and I'll bring patience with me.
This place is pretty good. The food amount was overwelmingly hugee!!!! I highly doubt that most people can finish their food. .  The wait was about 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 mins.. but felt shorter because they were calling names pretty fast and often.. sucks to go when you are really hungry cause you have to wait and there is also cooking time so by the time my food came out i wasnt hungry as i waa before :( but all in all everything was good and our server was also good. Very friendly and checked up on us often. :)
Large portion of disgusting food. Pancake was bigger than my face but not fluffy at all. I'm really not into large quantity of food that lacks in quality.
You definitely need to order the chicken ceaser salad! It's beyond flavorful and delicious! Also, they serve very large portions!
Love this place.i  First went to San Diego then when I found out there was one in vegas well here I go.  Always a line.  Bar is small but we always try to get in and dine at the bar. Don't miss out.
The wait was quoted @ 40mins around 1 in the afternoon but it seems as though we were seated quicker than expected. . . The server was above par. He was attentive and definitely aware of the his customers orders. I give him props because he looked as though his feet were aching but he kept pushing through. . . Seating arrangement is tight especially if one has long legs. . . Now the food, the waffles were just okay (3/5) without the syrup but as soon as I added the syrup my taste buds were pleased (5/5). . . The sausage was great. The eggs tasted as expected. The biscuit was good with the strawberry jam (oh so yummy). I would definitely go again. Last comment: the coffee is nothing special kinda watered down.
I sat up at the bar so I didn't have to wait.  They were serving up very tasty looking drinks like Bloody Mary's and everyone sitting near me enjoyed what they ordered. I had biscuits and gravy with potatoes and eggs which was awesome. I could only eat half of it.
Sage chicken Benedict was awesome! Large portions and good prices for Vegas. The smores hot chocolate was soooooo freakin good. i was so full but couldn't leave until I finished it! Going to San Diego and definitely going to try that location out.
I heard a lot of good things about this place so I thought I'd give it a try. Went about a week ago with one of my gfs and we loved it!!! I wanted to try the fried chicken and waffles and she wanted an eggs benedict dish so our waiter suggested we share Andy's sage fried chicken benedict and get a bacon waffle on the side..and let me tell you it was delicious, filling, and HUGE!! We couldn't even finish it between the two of us...def glad we went and I will be going back!!
Great food, the portions are awesome.  The wait is kind of long and the service is decent
Being a chicken & waffle connoisseur, it was a given that we were going to partake of Hash House's fare. And after perusing their menu, the mouth-watering descriptions of their food certainly fired up my imagination. I could barely wait to see what exactly they would serve up. We showed up to the Quad, and saw the line was already building even at the early hour we arrived. We were quoted a 40 minute wait, and waited exactly that long.. . We were seated quickly, and our server was friendly. I ordered the chicken & waffles, and she ordered the fried chicken benedict. For some reason, our server warned us saying it would take upwards of 30 minutes to produce my dish. Not sure why -- she said it was busy. But come on -- it's fried chicken. Doesn't take that long to cook, and if a freaking Vegas restaurant that specializes in the stuff doesn't have it dropping in the fryer every minute, well shoot. . . Thirty minutes pass, and our server produces two massively towering plates of food. Four waffles (with bacon in between), two chicken breasts, stabbed with a knife to hold it all together. Lots of sage garnish (of course, sage-fried chicken and all). It looked impressive. Unfortunately, the impressions ended there. Mediocre waffles -- even the bacon couldn't save them. Even more mediocre chicken -- flavorful and seasoned, for sure, but undercooked. Not raw undercooked, but rather, the breading was still doughy and not fully crisp. It was fine and all, but considering I paid $20 freaking dollars for it, totally underwhelming. I spent the entire time looking on at her dish, which looked and tasted considerably better than mine.. . If you're a fan of Roscoe's and the like, don't expect the same here. It's all glamor and glitz, and no substance at all. If the dish were half the size and minus all the garnish, it could've actually been decent. Even more so if it didn't take so freaking long to serve. If you like long waits, high prices, and deeply mediocre southern-style grub, then sure, come on down.
