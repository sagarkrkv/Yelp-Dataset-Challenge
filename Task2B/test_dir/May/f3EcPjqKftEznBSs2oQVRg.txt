Ugh this club is damn ghetto!. . As a local, I am pretty sure I have been to all the clubs/lounges in town, few are good most are whatever. But Pure Nightclub is pretty bottom of the barrel when it comes to nightlife in Vegas. This place is really showing its age now. I decided to stop by for a UNLV event and noticed how miserable the exterior was. If you didn't see hordes of people waiting in line in the sports lobby, you would have no idea there was even a club here. . . The bouncers here are here more stupid that usual, but we got in in less than 10 minutes. Walking around, the place looks incredibly tacky. White cheap porcelain tiles, and bare walls are flanked by long hanging curtains. There is a small outdoor patio which is rarely open, only when Pure is packed to capacity. The layout is pretty standard, 2 bars, main dance floor, tables for bottle service everywhere. The club itself is pretty big and Pure is one of the few Strip nightclubs to consistently play hip-hop instead of EDM.. . With the way nightlife is here in Vegas, I am surprised Pure has been open this long. Its old, boring, and overpriced. . . On a side note for my out of town peeps: the people handing out "VIP Passes" on the strip/inside Caesars are liars. You will get in free if you are inside before midnight, but the guest line is usually an hour long anyways. If they make you pay cover JUST LEAVE, its not worth it at all.
Super fun place to celebrate a 21st bday. Just make sure to go through VIP or else it might be too packed and crazy. They treat VIPs very well ;)
After joining freevegasclubpasses from a promoter, we chose to check out Pure in Ceasars.  Now Im not a 21 yr old college girl anymore.  The crazy partying and drinking days are over!  So hubby and I just wanted to go to have some drinks and dance.  The bouncers were cool and we got in for free through the GA line.  The club is nice and because of the winter season, they had the main part only open.  I took advantage of free drinks.  We had a good time and danced till my feet hurt.  Im sure this club gets packed in the hotter months.  We were ok with the smaller crowds because I have done that already.  Next time we come up..we will hang here again.
This review is long over due. We went to Pure in January with some friends celebrating anniversaries and birthdays together and we ordered bottle service. They put us on the roof (without warning us when I made the reservation) and it was ice cold (we would have brought jackets if we had known). While the offered individual drink service, it was highly discouraged since the bar was downstairs. The bottle service was exceeding expensive for what we received because the service was terrible. We were basically ignored. Jessica, the person assigned to us out-right lied to us a number of times, and when we called her out on it, she just shrugged us off. The main dance floor was so crowded you could move. While we there with couples, the dance floor was primarily filled with men (8:1 men to women). My wife got hit a few times with me staring right there (it was somewhat entertaining). The music was good on the main dance floor, but they had different music upstairs (without a dance floor) that was not as good. Not doing this again.
