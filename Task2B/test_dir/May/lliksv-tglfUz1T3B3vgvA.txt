This place is a sleeper. From the outside you wouldn't think much but when you go inside the food and service are great! Very packed when I went so be sure to eat early.
There's not a lot I can add to all the rave reviews about Lotus, except to echo them - go give this place a try!!  There is more to Vegas than the Strip..... . I had to laugh at the descriptions of the location  - yes, it looks like you could be arranging a drug deal or two - but inside nirvana is waiting, so just ignore the shady neighbourhood.   . . Favs for me were the curries, but I'd love to return on my next visit to Vegas and try things that are new to me from their extensive menu - or maybe leave it up to the waiters to surprise me  ;-)
This place was incredible, and totally lived up to the hype. It is a distance from the center of things, but well worth the trip. Be careful with the heat of things--what is mild to you may not be so much in their kitchen!.   The place was spotless, the staff super-friendly, and Chef Saipin even took a picture with us. .   If you are feeling extra-adventurous, order from the back of the menu, for some of their Northern dishes.
Came to this place ready to be impressed after all of the hype. Maybe it was the high expectations but we were not too impressed. Great wine list but the food wasn't too impressive. Had the yellow and coconut/tomatoe/duck curry. Food was fine but did not live up to expectations. Veggies in the curry were raw.
It's all about the garlic prawns! Cooked to perfection and very sizable :) for $21 it better be.. . Also ordered the soft shell crab drunk noodle which was good but I've had better sauce on the noodles before but the soft shell crab tasted good and cooked well.. . Overall good dining experience.
Terribly overrated in almost every aspect. People will then ask: "Well, why is it so busy then?" Busy does not translate into a "quality experience" - hence the case here at Lotus of Siam. This is a tourist trap since it is close to the Strip with cabbies parked all around. This was also my third and final trip to "Lots of Siam". The food lacks flavor, and the Tom Yum soup is virtualy tasteless. The staff fouled up our orders and seemed indifferent to our needs even after it was quite obvious that we were unhappy / displeased. There was a complete lack of care and comfort / concern as well as management presence. Of all the Thai restaurants in town, this may very well be one of the worst I have been to. We will never return.
Always a great meal.  Probably the best Thai in Las Vegas. It's off the beaten path but worth the cab ride to get there if you are staying on the strip.
Are we even talking about this?!?! This place blows my mind every time. Those garlic prawns are a steal at twice the price. . . For a truly incomparable experience come here for dinner.
Ordered soup not spicy, it came spicy, we returned it and the same pot, with the  floating chillies came back and the waiter informed us it was just diluted, indifferent wait staff
Absolutely love this place. The food is amazing! The pad thai is to die for. Service is good. There's always a lot of people waiting but it is definitely worth the wait. I'm so glad I found this place.. It's become a tradition to eat here whenever I have friends in town.
I am new to Thai food and I love it so much!!! Great food and great prices. Never had a bad experience.
04/10/2014:. . This place is a must for Thai food lovers visiting Vegas. It is a bit off the strip, but, worth the drive. And you'll likely have to wait a while unless you were lucky to get through ahead of time to make a reservation. The cab drivers will also vouch for the popularity and demand of this place. . . We had the usual Pad Thai and Papaya Salad for appetizers. The grilled shrimp, green, red, and yellow curries are all good. The squid salad is excellent. The basil and garlic eggplant dish is excellent. You can substitute green beans if you're not a fan of eggplant. If you like your food spicy and your guests do not, make sure to ask for the fish sauce and fresh Thai bird chillies. That gives it a nice kick. Just be careful, it can make a grown man cry. One if our guests tried some and had tears run down his face as he grabbed for the Chang beer. . . Chang beer is the best pairing for Thai food - IMHO. They have a huge wine cellar and it sure looks impressive behind the glass room. However, I just can't seem to muster up the taste buds to pair this amazing Thai food with wine. . . I have been to this restaurant several times before. Finally making the time to recognize this place for the fine food it produces. I've turned a few business clients on to this place. They are hooked too. Always a must for me when in Vegas. Some reviewers describe this place as the best Thai food in the US, it's hard to argue with them.
Did I miss something? Food was fine, nothing special. I heard about this place last spring during a trip to vegas and have been eager to try it ever since. Yesterday was finally the day and I was sadly disappointed. I'm not sure if I inflated my expectations to Hugh or what. I ordered the chicken green curry since its my favorite thai dish and the fried rice sausage app as recommended by the where as a specialty. So excited to have my taste buds blown away, I sat eating with sheet boredom. The app was just crunchy and sour tasting and the curry was runny/watery not creamy and the spice didn't kick in until I bit a pepper. . Perhaps I didn't try the right thing but my thinking was everything should have been very good. Oh well.
This restaurant was recommended to us by a local friend. He said it was the best Thai in Vegas, hands down. It's located in an economically--and otherwise--depressed strip mall. (There's a bedraggled "Adult Day Care" two doors down with a flickering, half-lit neon sign. Love you, mom and dad.) I'm not complaining about that, though. In my experience if a local tells you that something's the best and it's in a terrible location, you're usually in for a real treat. So I was actually getting more excited. . . A few of our party were under 5 minutes late and the staff acted like they were doing us a favor by seating us. They were very busy, but we *did* have reservations. . . When the waiter came by, he was very much in a hurry. As a NYer, I don't generally have a problem with that, but I rarely see a waiter rush like that, with no effort to be hospitable at all. The guy who filled our waters was far more personable and helpful. . . I ordered the Massaman Curry, which is a standard/classic dish. When I got it it wasn't hot, but warm verging on room temperature and it sat there cooling more as we waited several minutes for the rice to arrive. When I tasted it, the flavors were great, but there was no spice at all. The waiter didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it and I didn't ask because usually at a Thai place, they just give you 'medium spice for an American' if you don't specify. . . The prices were very decent and more inline with their location than their apparent popularity, which is good. . . Locals seem to love this place, so maybe I just had bad luck. It happens. But based on my experience, the place gets two stars.
Saw this place from Anthony bourdain's tv. Show. Place was packed on a Thursday afternoon. Got seated right away, avoided the buffet, went straight for garlic prawns and the back menu. Husband at a spicy curry with extra rice and I decided to go for the drunken shift shell crab. DELISH! Thai ice tea was amazing too. Now I see why this place has good reviews, authentic thai food made with amazing spices. Portions were large, and service was nothing to complain about. Just thought it was in a weird strip mall location. Def worth a shot if you're in Vegas and like thai food.
This place is definitely delicious... As long as you aren't ordering take-out.  The prices are a little steep to begin with, and ordering to go is a huge mistake because they become INCREDIBLY stingy.  . . This place is right down the street from my home, and after ordering take-out too many times to count, I just can't do it anymore.  Most recently I ordered a tofu curry that was almost entirely sauce, and literally had two pieces of tofu, two pieces of potato, and two pieces of carrot.  THAT'S IT.  My boyfriend and I and a friend had planned to have a family style dinner at home, and ordered several items that ended up being comparably limited (a shrimp dish with two shrimp, etc.).  It's just unforgivable I'm afraid, especially since we spend about $70 on take-out each time, and tip 20% despite eating at home.   I'll probably go back if I decide to spend the night out, but from now on, I'll be ordering my take-out from Le Thai :/
Had the garlic prawns, they were good.  Red curry was ok.. . Service good. . But not all that people make it out to be!
The food and service was excellent! The waitor recommended the crispy duck in pagnang curry and the seabass and drunken noodle and both were excellent. The restaurant is in a small strip mall that's a bit shady. And, we waited about 10 minutes to be able to hail a cab back to the strip. I'd go back again for the food when in Vegas.
We usually watch Anthony Bourdain shows for food ideas when we are traveling to exotic international destinations. We don't consider Vegas in that set but we were glad we saw the recent Season 3 show just before a quick weekend trip there.  When our hotel, the Las Vegas Renaissance, also recommended Lotus of Siam, we knew we had to make a visit. . . We took a taxi about 2 miles from the hotel (which is near the convention center) to reach the strip mall -yes, it looks a little unexciting from the outside on a Monday morning at 11:45 am. We met two other traveling friends there, and focusedon the Northern Thai food (near the back of the menu) that is Lotus of Siam's specialty. . . Between the 4 of us, we enjoyed Sai Oua (northern Style Sausage), Northern Larb, and two orders of the  Khao Soi, described as a typical Burmese influenced dish is served with egg noodles in a curry base with a touch of coconut cream, with your choice of meat. (We tried both the pork and the chicken versions.). . All were excellent, and very spicy, although you can request spice levels from 1 to 10. See photos here: http://www.travelingwiththejones.com/2014/05/10/anthony-bourdain-knows-good-food-northern-thai-in-las-vegas/. . Take the short taxi ride. Order from the Northern Thai specialties. Enjoy! Perhaps Las Vegas is an exotic international destination after all.
Bad experience at Lotus of Siam. Food not taste that good. Food come out at room temperature more on the side of getting cold. Service was ok. This is my second time. First time was 4 years ago and it was ok. Anyway so disappointed!!!
Yeah, it's everything it should be, and more. Food has spot on flavor, nice and hot. I've gone three times, each time I've left satisfied. I'm big on soup and this place masters at them, I recommend the coconut chicken soup. After that venture out and try anything because I'm under the impression that everything they serve is delicious. One of the best if not the best restaurant in Vegas.
I came here with a large group of my employees and we had an outstanding time. We were able to have a fantastic array of items and each person walked away spending a little less than $35 with tax and tip included. . . There was this one prawn dish with a spicy chili verde-like sauce on top (picture included). It was unreal delicious. Unreal. . . My one gripe is that the start of service was really slow and that's after we waited almost an hour to be seated.
Just finished dinner. Heard about this place on Top Chef. It is totally worth it! We arrived an hour early for dinner. It would not look like it from the outside but this place is very nice, the service is very good, the atmosphere is so comfortable, and the food is exploding with flavor! We had what the waiter recommended was their most top rated dishes. He was spot on. The prawns were huge and cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and so juicy inside. The soup had many levels of flavor but everything worked together. I could have a whole pot of Tom Kah Kai. The servers were so polite and quick. I can't wait to come back.
About half the menu here is legitimately some of the best Thai available in the US, but that being said, there are some holes/disappointments in the menu here.. . First: avoid the soups, especially to go, but even fresh, I think both the Tom Yum and Tom Kha Ga were pretty disappointing.  Second, there's nothing particularly wrong with eating Phad Thai or other basic noodle dishes, even if I skip them in general, but it's a huge error here, there are so many things on the menu you cannot find elsewhere, you are really missing out.. . Highlights:. . Larb, sour crispy rice, drunken noodles (found the sea bass to be over cooked and disappointing, the rest of the proteins I've tried with it have been fine), panang curry (GET THE SHORT RIB), thai beef salad, pork blood soup.  . . Keep in mind they have a pretty high heat tolerance, if you order something as a 5 on their 1-10 scale you will have quite a bit of heat, and I don't see a 10 as being enjoyable by any rational person including people who self-profess to never be able to get food hot enough.  I love spicy in general and wouldn't order anything much higher than a 6 or 7 here with the possible exception of the beef salad where the crisp vegetables compliment the heat very nicely.
What did I missed  ? . Seem to be a lot of hoopla about this place, so we were a group of 3-4 Thai ( born / raised in Thailand ) checking this place out.. Boy, American people are so easily pleased. . Don't quite understand the dilapidated  location compare to the strip and vast openness of Las Vegas, Is that mean the owner can not quite get it together? . People seem to be begging to eat here, some came in Limousine. . We agreed that mass majority of street food in Thailand can beat this place by far,  Price and food test. Pretty sure MSG. is a main corporate of these stars. ( I away get real thirsty after yummy MSG. of a good food ) . Next day we went to Chinatown ( Spring mountain & Valley road something ) There were 2 restaurants facing each other. We tried one of them which is pretty much same or better by $5- $10 a dish. . Still not sure what I missed. PS. notice that sugar  and star rating goes in the same direction for most Thai food in America. It does not work that way in the real Thailand.
YES!. . finally - good food in las vegas!  it seems fitting that you need to take a cab to a random-seeming strip mall to get some good food that won't cost you 100's of $$$.  this place is authentic thai food, which i really appreciated bc i hadn't experienced any authenticity the entire 2 days i'd been in vegas.  . i dragged my brother away from the casinos on the strip to come here, he was annoyed that we had to wait an hour for a table, but once we were seated and he saw the wine selection he started to come around. the service was really fast, and the dishes were delicious.
Top Chef Masters definitely gave me high expectations. Yup, Lorena Garcia, I have one brow raised at you right now. . . I gave in to the hype and put it on my "Places to Eat At" list when I recently went to Vegas. Mind you, I was with my family and, my step mom is Thai. I thought it would give me bonus stepdaughter points so I was pretty excited to bring her to Lotus of Siam. . . The Crispy Catfish Salad was great! The catfish pieces were fried crispy perfection and the salad tasted light to me. The dressing wasn't too salty nor too sour. I definitely loved it and was excited to have our other orders come out. . . The food sure did start to come out one by one and sadly, I got disappointed. I don't know if it was because maybe what we ordered weren't their "stellar" dishes but oh, boy. I wasn't a happy camper. We got the Tom Yum Goong, Panang Curry, Pad Thai and my dad got an extra bowl of noodles in soup with meatball type things floating. . . I'm sorry, but my go-to spot in Thai Town in L.A. does a better job at preparing what I had ordered. That Tom Yum Goong was just pure sourness with no kick whatsoever (my stepmom asked them to make it spicy in Thai). The Panang and Pad Thai were both on the sweeter side as well. My stepmom agreed to what I had to say as well and, she's a straight-up, legit Thai lady herself. I only have the privilege of saying that I've been to Thailand but she's got it all in her blood. Her opinion has to count as something, right?. . I'm not ready to cross them out my list just yet. Everyone definitely deserves a second chance and I could have made a mistake in ordering Thai staples but, that's what scares me too. If the staples aren't even close to amazing then what more the dishes they're known for? I guess I'll just have to wait and see.
This place really strive for quality versus quantity. Unlike most Thai restaurants that I've been to, the portions are quite smaller. . . Arriving at 5:30pm on a Saturday( right when they open for dinner), the place is already super packed. Lines start to form inside & outside the restaurant. This place isn't at all located in the nicer part of town. . . Finally able to seat, we immediately order a round of Moscato, my favorite!! And oh my goodness best moscato I ever tasted. They do have a large selection of wines. As for foods we ordered-- garlic chicken wings, shrimp & chicken pad Thai, That beef salad, and duck drunken noodles. All pretty tasty. I'm usually used to having Thai food that is burning my tongue, so the lack of spiciness in the foods really surprised me. But I can not complain. The food was beyond delicious. The Pad Thai is one of the best I ever had. I love when my noodles come out cooked just right & not mushy and stuck together. . . The service was pretty slow but the place was extremely packed. Our food cameout periodically and not all at the same time which we appreciated, so the table wasn't so cluttered. . . I definitely would return.
Lived up to the hype. Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you. Very plush yet minimalist settings inside. We had the spicy green beans, khao soi w/ chicken, crispy duck w/ panang curry, and deep fried crispy shrimp. The shrimp was so crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. Interesting presentation: they separate the shell from the body but they are still attached at the tail. The shell is equally edible w/ great texture.
I'm partial to Anthony Bourdain. Fond of, even. I imagine him narrating my dishes in his poetic prose. Hearing he visited Lotus of Siam put the place in my head, and over I went with the family! It was a 40 minute wait for a table, but we were so very excited.. . The menu is large. Too many choices. "Quality over quantity," as it's said. I would have appreciated the server spending more time recommending traditional Northern Thai dishes, but perhaps I'll have to go when they can spare the attention. . . We ordered quite a few dishes, but not one came out at a temperature that didn't lead you to believe it was sitting in front of a fan on a hot summer day.. . Spicy Chicken Wings. Issan-style Beef Jerky. Tom Yum Kai. Seared Scallops with Chili Basil Leaves. Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab. Garlic Prawns. Braised Short Rib with Panang. Crispy Duck with Panang. . I don't like to request my dishes be brought back for any reason, but I find the taste of cold fried food incredibly off-putting. The prawns were the only dish I asked of. It would have felt exhausting to request every dish be reheated. And then there's the question of "how?" How are you warming my dish? In a microwave, or are you sparing a few precious minutes in a wok?. . Business is good for Lotus of Siam thanks to the celebrity visits. Maybe with some extra funds they'll invest in better warming lamps for their dishes, or teach their chefs/runners how to better coordinate the timing sending food out. There's so much potential; I know it and I want to believe it. For this reason I'll go back and try again.. . (In a perfect world of temperature-hot foods, I would definitely order the drunken noodles and garlic prawns again; everything else was uninspiring)
I have had so many people tell me about this place and finally convinced someone to go with me! There were so many options to choose from the menu seemed overwhelming at first - but the food was sooooo good! I will definitely be back for awesome Thai food since I played it safe by just ordering Pad Thai. Also was surprised at how big it was once I walked in - who knew? Totally a hidden gem in Vegas and deserving of all the exposure it's gotten in media and from my peers!
One thing I really didn't like about this restaurant is that their portions are SMALL. Between four people we shared four dishes and from each dish we didn't even get the size of our hand (serving size). Another thing, our waiter didn't come around as often as we'd like. Our waters and teas were emptied out and he came around to fill them when we were done. Work on your service skills, you're in Las Vegas. Better service = bigger tips.. . On the outside, this place looks like a true hole in the wall. On the inside, could use a little more remodeling/repainting. Maybe some statues. The wine cellar is pretty cool though.. . We ordered papaya salad, curry, pad thai and pineapple fried rice. All delicious but I wish they gave more.. . Will be returning, skeptically.
Oh my goodness!  We drove here under recommendation of a friend.  It is amazing!   Non descript little strip mall on the edge of town.  When we pulled into the parking lot at 12pm,  patrons were doing nothing short of running to the door to claim their table.  The crispy rice appetizer was a rocket fire explosion of flavors.  We had the Tom Kah Kai soup, Pad Se-Ew with chicken, Crispy Duck with Chili Mint Leaves, all washed down with Thai Iced Tea and Singha and finished off with the delicious banana roll with coconut ice cream for dessert.  As my dearly departed father would have said, "this meal was a religious experience!"  Highly recommended!
Took two tries to actually eat here. First night (Sunday) I tried to make a reservation and they told me after the waiting list gets long enough, they stop taking reservations - you better just show up and get on the list. So we tried again Monday. This time we showed up in person and got on the list. Not too hard to spot - if you're travelling eastbound on Sahara heading away from the Strip you'll eventually see the backside of a dingy mall and LOTUS OF SIAM quite visible on the wall on the south side of Sahara. You then make the next turn and find a parking spot in the mall close to the restaurant. Shouldn't be hard at night since most of the businesses are either closed or not anywhere near as busy as Lotus Of Siam. We had about an hour's wait and the waiting area only has a few chairs so we decided to venture the mall outside. The rest of the mall is mostly Korean bars or restaurants plus a few sketchy "clubs." None of the restaurants seemed to be "hopping." Lotus Of Siam probably had more people in it than all the surrounding businesses combined. There were lots of shuttered businesses - perhaps this was once a thriving Koreatown in Las Vegas but this mall's best days are definitely in the past. Maybe it's a lot more thriving during the day but walking around there at night gave me a kinda creepy vibe. So we circled the whole place and came back and were seated not long after. I guess some folks couldn't wait any longer and left as a few names the hostess called out did not produce any acknowledgement from the people still sitting and waiting. There were so many people in the restaurant that when we finally got seated almost elbow to elbow next to the people at the tables on either side it felt like we were in a crowded diner. Couldn't they just buy out one of the bigger empty lots around and expand? So anyway, we ordered the crispy duck in Panang curry, the crispy garlic prawns, and our squeamish pal ordered the Panang curry with chicken. The crispy duck was awesome. So were the prawns - you eat the whole thing - shell and all - as we were instructed by our waiter. The Panang curry with chicken was rather lackluster in comparison but that was pretty much eaten by our unadventurous buddy who won't eat seafood and for whom duck was too exotic. Based on the first two dishes I'd say this place lives up to the hype. Portions weren't overly huge and the price was a little steep but we left satisfied. We'll probably be back one day. I'll say it would probably be worthwhile to check this place out if you're actually quite familiar with Thai food. Especially if you flew in from out of town - paying a king's ransom for cab fare from the strip and back as well as the long wait will seem much more worth it.
Delicious........ This's Thai food, taste same in Thailand, by Thai girl.  . I love lotus of Siam.
I never post reviews on yelp. This place is worth it, came twice in 4 days. Amazing food, come early or late as it is always full. . . Order the #14 (crispy rice) lime cilantro crispy delicious. . . Order the crispy duck with panang, perfect.
Simply the best Thai I have ever had!  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Be prepared for some waiting to get a table though.  There is a bar to wait though.
I was in Vegas over the weekend and came to Lotus of Siam two days in a row. After seeing several articles, an Anthony Bourdain episodes, and a James Beard elect (2011) award- I could not wait to try it. . . So I was lucky enough to go twice here over the course of the weekend. I went Saturday (5:30PM- opening time) & Sunday 6PM, both without reservations. At opening, you may see a massive line, but it moves fast and you get a seat almost right away. If you wait a half hour, the wait bumps up to 1 hour. So either get a reservation or go right when it opens. . . After coming here twice, I have to give Lotus of Siam all around compliments:. . 1) The staff-  they are very friendly and amazingly fast.   If you are in a rush , you can go from seating to check in 30 min. But at the same time, if you are enjoying yourself and chatting, they do not rush you. . . 2) The management's ethics- While I was waiting for a table on Sunday, about six 60+ year old customers (not sure which European country they hailed from) came in and seemed highly annoyed about an hour wait. Those of us patiently waiting (which included grandparents and children) watched as one man in the group pulled out a wad of cash,and tucked $40-60 dollars in his palm to bribe the staff for a table. This guy continued to haggle with the staff for about 10 minutes. But the staff continued to decline his bribe and did not let him skip ahead of anyone. They gained a huge amount of respect from me and the the other dinner's who saw these events play out.. . 3) The food- Delicious and extremely well priced. Now I enjoy a really spicy meal and want to roll my eyes when people ask me "are you SURE you want spicy...it's really spicy!"  I usually like it as hot as it comes. But something made me feel like the food was going to be authentic here so I went "medium spice." For me this was perfect, enough to tingle the lips and make the nose run a little, but not too much to make me chug a glass of milk. If you cannot handle spice, go well below medium.. . Appetizers I tried: . -Golden Fried Tofu (like any other place, good but nothing unique). -Nam Kao Tod (Small dish but packed with spice and flavor, really loved this). . Dishes I tried: . -Chili & Basil Seafood combo (delicious with rich basil flavor, good kick to it too). - Pad Se Ew (basic dish but well made). -Thum Ka Noon (Rich, spicy dish with jackfuit but not heavy at all, one of my favorites). - Kang Hung Lay (sweet and spicy pork curry, heavier dish but packed with flavor). . Dessert: . -Mango and sticky Rice (basic dish but really fresh mango and rice was not dried, delicious!). . . This place was great and will be a must on future Vegas trips!
This place is crazy busy.  If you really want to go here and eat without a reservation, get there early.  I was there right when they opened and the restaurant was packed in about 10 minutes.  I heard about this place for their crispy shrimp and it did not disappoint.  They even fried the shrimp shell that was delicious.  Their other dishes didn't knock my socks off, but not bad by any means.  The ambiance is very nice and they have a great wine selection.  Their portions are definitely along the lines of a fine-dine with a higher prices and smaller portions.
Time for an update since this is the second time I've been here (technically 3rd time but 1visit we did the buffet.... which reminds me... don't do the buffet). . So once again we ordered the garlic prawns and tom yum koong. Both above average in the scale of deliciousness, i mean WAY ABOVE!! Be warn about the spiciness level on the soup. We did the 7 and would have probably fared better work a 6, and that's coming from people whom normally can spice it up with the rest of em. We also ordered the pud se ew which was great as well. . . This is my personal favorite thai spot now. Too bad i have to cross state borders for it.
went for lunch since dinner is always packed...lunch buffet was nearly over but hostess kindly asked us if we wanted to do the lunch buffet. we decided to do a la carte though. crispy garlic shrimp, duck panong, and soft shell crab drunken noodles. each dish was roughly $20 but they were all the signature dishes, so not even mad about it at all. all of them were bomb. crispy shrimp literally tasted like chips just like the menu description says. so much flavor in that dish. can't handle spicy things too much since I'm japanese but didn't care that these were medium on spice, they were so good at that point it doesn't matter, just wipe the sweat out of my eyes and keep eating. one of the best things about lotus is the amazing wine list...like seriously tons of wines under $50 that are amazing. off strip and kinda in the lightweight ghetto i guess they don't kill ppl with prices. texted one of my go to wine guys and he picked a bomb bottle of riesling for $30 big ones. it was amazing, fresh fruit, crisp and light, perfect for spicy food. . . the only thing that kills me abut that place is the decor, like seriously rip up the 10 year old green stained carpet please!!!! put fake hardwood floor or re due the carpet please. it makes the room so dark and puts a downer on the experience. service was a little slow that day due to the room being busy but every one was apologetic and friendly, and thats all i need. not expecting 5 star service at this type of spot. . . so happy with lunch that day and def going back. heard about this place so many times and been here for 9 years, such a mistake not going way back when i heard about this spot. big menu so if you are going for the first time i would recommend the last 2 pages which is the chef selections. a little more $$ but totally worth it.. . $30 bottle of riesling + 3 amazing entrees = a great start to a day...
The service was good, didn't make a reservation and they sat me although they were slightly busy for a Tuesday evening.  I can imagine how busy this place gets on weekends.  I kept it simple had the chicken wontons which were great with the sweet and sour sauce, The crab fried rice was good maybe use more visual crab, and the Garlic prawns which were very good however good have been better if they came with a dipping sauce or something.  It looks like a hole in the wall from outside but pretty nice inside.  I would come back again.  They have a very large menu so be prepared to have a lot of decisions to make.
The food here is great, but hype doesn't mean you can slack on service. We went for lunch for the first time and arrived at 1:20. They sold us on a buffet they closed 20 minutes prior but did not mention it. We paid for a half full buffet they had no intention of re-stocking and didn't care when we asked about why they didn't tell us. . . We paid $30.00 to not eat here.. . So disappointing!
Add another rating of outstanding to the pile.  . . We've eaten Thai in the depths of Thai Town in Hollywood and some really great places in Long Beach, and this--I have to say--exceeded in quality and authenticity.  . . Three and a half days on the Vegas Strip, we ate at Lotus twice.  Yum.  . . A note on comparison to SEA (another of our reviews):  Lotus is better, if you will take the short drive to it (and look beyond the scary strip mall it's in).  SEA is good, and has other non-Thai dishes.  Given a choice, Lotus wins easily.
I don't really see what the hype is all about. Yes, it's good but the way people rave about it. EH, I wouldn't wait hours on end to eat at this restaurant. When we called in today to see how long the wait would be or if we could make reservation, the girl said nothing was available till monday. WTH? We took our chance, walked in, and only waited 15 min. We ordered the Issan sausage, crispy duck w/mint, nam kao tod, and the tom kah kai. I felt like a lot of the food was overly salty, but maybe its just my taste pallet. Everything was okay, not super amazing.
Garlic prawns and crispy duck curry are the best. I could eat this everyday. . . The place was so packed when we went for dinner Friday night. Our reservation was for 7:30 and yea, full house.  Great service and tasty food.
