We stayed here with a group of friends this month. This was my second time here, and the second time was just as good as the first one. . The food is amazing here, and the rooms are great as well. My husband was pretty irritated at the fact that they wouldn't upgrade us. He booked four rooms the weekend before- then came back with our group and we had booked 3 rooms with them. They wouldn't give us any incentives or perks for the returned business.. Overall the hotel is nice, rooms aren't huge. It's a boutique feel. The location is great- and my favorite is the Buffet.
Base room with city view is great.  Bed is super comfy and bathroom is spacious and luxe.  City view is really nice.  The electric drapes are cool once you figure out how to work the !@&$!? controls.  Check-in is relatively quick for Vegas standards and the check-out is a breeze.   The casino is nice, the restaurant options are great and location is convenient to Cosmo, Monte Carol, Planet Hollywood, Bellagio and Caesars.
Horrible check in process. So slow and over 100 people backed up on a Monday in May. They should plan staff based on arrivals. Huge waste of time and no apologies or comps for over an hour to check in
This review is strictly about the sports book and the sports bar right outside of it!!!.   The sports book here is awesome!!! Love the comfortable chairs and the atmosphere!!! The staff inside the sports book is really friendly!. . Now about the bar outside....  We decided to go to this bar to order drinks. After sitting down, we inserted money into the poker machines and not long after was approached by the bartender John. He informed us that to have drinks comped, even if you were gambling, you needed their MLife cards. So we told him that we would like them and he radioed the information to someone that sent two hotel reps to get us signed up! They explained that you had to accumulate so many points while gambling that would later translate into how many comps you would receive. I didn't really understand all of it but figured I will get on the website when I return home to read it over. Mean time, our 2 beers were comped... We continued playing for awhile longer and my boyfriend ordered another beer, also comped. Now comes the reason for the three stars... There were two older men playing the machines to the left of my boyfriend. Apparently they were under the assumption that they would not be charged for their drinks since they were playing the machines. So the man on the far left was extremely upset when he was presented with a bill for the grey goose drinks he had ordered. This is when John, the bartender who had been joking with them earlier turned on him. He was completely rude when telling him that it was hotel policy! The man got up and left right after. The man sitting next to my boyfriend said something to John and received the same treatment and left. When we asked if everything was ok, John's response was " they aren't my friends, I don't know them and I am not going to lose my jobs for them. .  A couple minutes later, we decided to order a couple of shots of Patron, indicating to John, that we knew that we would be charged for them! And when we received the bill, we soon realized why the men were so upset!!! 2 shots of Patron $32!!! I am a bartender and this price is ridiculous!!! Still not his fault, he doesn't make the prices.... However my boyfriend decided that he wanted one more beer. John looked at the machine in front of him and, pretty nastily asked" are you still playing?!!! " his tone was extremely rude and I felt my boyfriend, who is pretty even tempered, tense up!! His reply was yes and while John went to deal with some people he obviously knew or had waited on before, my boyfriend inserted a few more dollars into the machine!! He got his beer and when John turned away we moved over to the casino!!! .  We will probably be back in the future, but if John is the bartender, we will probably drink elsewhere!
the aria was nice but I wouldn't say its the best hotel in vegas.. . its pretty big nut not nearly as big as some of the other hotels that require a mile hike just to get in and out of. . . there is nothing spectacular about it. the decor is nice and chic but kinda minimalist in comparison to the other vegas greats.. . the rooms are large and the smart technology is great. I wish the bathroom would've been a little bigger (and it would've been super cool if the wall was glass in the shower to be able to see out of the room floor to ceiling windows).. . the service was good but check in was a LONG wait. about 30 minutes standing in line and it was only 9 am. they did have a great feature where they gave us room keys and text us the room # when it was ready so we wouldn't have to wait in line again.. . overall it is a nice hotel in a great central location on the strip, I would stay there again especially with the awesome rate we got 155/night.
After going to Las Vegas 10 times, I finally found my spot.  This hotel just had a different feel to it, and the location is great right next to the Cosmo and Bellagio.  The rooms are very modern and spacious.  I love closing the blinds with the remote control.  The servers and staff at the pool were attentive and fun.  There are only two things I would change, the elevators are in the center of the buidling and since the building is long it might be a 10 minute walk to your room.  Also, the check in took way too much time.
To me the bed is the most important part of a hotel. If you have a great bed, I love it. The Aria's bed is better than mine. I do have a very nice bed as my wife works at a bedding company and we get awesome deals on our beds.. . As for the rest.......... . The room is huge and the view is awesome. The cool gadgets and tech options are interesting but really not needed. The housekeepers are awesome don't forget to leave them a little something for their service.. . Things I liked:. Security, free parking, valet, doesn't smell smoky in casino, pool, lots of food choices, not as expensive as you'd think, people are very helpful. . Things I didn't like:. Everything is pricey, can get crowded, can be a long wait to check in (we've stayed here 3 times. 1st time it took 10min, 2nd time was about 30min and last time was about 2min), sports book and restaurant outside of it.. . You can save a lot of cash if you sign up for their offers on the website. They will send you texts. The last time we went it was 150 total per night with a 50 per day resort credit. It was great! We selected the last week of January and stayed M-F. The 150 included taxes and resort fees!. . Shop around for the best dates and deals. You can stay here for the same price as an off strip Holiday Inn. This is not the best hotel in Vegas but it is awesome! The hotel decor is very chic.
My sister and brother-in-law were visiting without their kids so it was a perfect time for me and my husband to take them to Vegas.  I chose to book at Aria because it's relatively new, and we've never stayed there before.  . . When trying to find Aria's self-park garage, use the Mandarin Hotel as your landmark.  Once you turn in that corner, you will see the signs to Aria's parking.  We were able to park close to the elevators but the walk to the check-in desk was really loooong....it was on the opposite side of the parking garage hotel entrance.   Upon entering the hotel from the parking garage, walk to your right to reach the lobby...it's a relatively shorter walk.  There was a long line at the check-in desk but it moved pretty quickly.  We were assigned a room on the seventh floor.. . The website claims the hotel room greets you as you enter the door -- the lighting and the window shade open, the music starts playing.  Unfortunately, none of those happened when we entered our room.  And it truly was unfortunate because we didn't realize the blackout drapes didn't work until we were getting ready for bed at 2am.  We called for service and were told somebody will come shortly.  We fell asleep waiting for service that never came.  Come morning, I couldn't go back to sleep because it was too freakin' bright!  We called for service again.  Someone from the service department immediately called us back and apparently, it was the first time they received the work order!  A technician came a few minutes later.  He was unable to repair the broken mechanism on the spot, but he offered to manually close the blackout drapes so we were still able to sleep some more.  He also arranged a time when they would come back to fix whatever needed to be fixed.  Tohis credit, he was very polite and professional.  And they did repair it as promised.  They even gave a courtesy call to make sure we were still amenable to the scheduled time.. . The room itself was spacious. There was a mini fridge which we couldn't use for our personal stuff (unless we pay extra!) because everything in it had a sensor that if you so much move an item, it automatically charges your account.  They had plush robes provided but it would have been better if they provided slippers as well (especially since my bro-in-law forgot to bring his own!).  We brought our own toiletries so it didn't bother us that they didn't have toothbrush and toothpaste in the bathroom.  I was surprised that they didn't have a coffeemaker available in the room.  I guess they wanted people to buy coffee from the in-house Starbucks where the line was always loooong.  The beds were comfortable, and I totally loved the pillows!  . . My husband's hip injury got worse with all the walking we did in Vegas so he called the Fitness Center to inquire if they had foam rollers.  They had them so he went there to do some floor stretching using those rollers.  He didn't bring any workout shoes but I appreciated the staff's flexibility in still allowing him to stay when he indicated he just planned on doing some floor exercises.  .   . We were also able to use Aria's pool facilities.  We were surprised they didn't have shower facilities in the pool area.  There were plenty of available poolside lounge chairs.  I wasn't happy with the poolside food and drink service though because come lunch time, I only saw 2 servers serving the entire pool area, one on each side.  It took me over 30minutes just to flag someone down.  My husband said earlier in the morning he was approached a number of times just to ask if he needed anything. I think they should assign more staff during peak hours. . . I was able to print our boarding passes through the Concierge.  I had to wait in line a bit because there were only a couple of staff members available, but the person who assisted me was genuinely nice that I couldn't help but not be mad.  . . I wanted to try checking out by text but I remembered we had some resort credit so I opted to check-out over the phone to ensure all charges and credits were accounted for.  We didn't encounter any problems with check-out. . . Overall, our stay at Aria was just okay because it fell short of my expectations.  With so many hotels to choose from, Aria needs to get things right the first time every single time if they want repeat customers.  And since they didn't quite get it right, I'll be looking else where on my next visit to Vegas....unless they have an unbeatable deal price-wise.
My husband's favourite casino.
I've stayed in just about every hotel in Vegas . I'll tell you this is the best. Best restaurants , coffee shops and rooms. . . People are right no coffee maker in your room and you can't fill you min bar with your food. If that's how you roll stay at Luxor. . . Go and enjoy the food in drink in the hotel. Who wants to have coffee in the room with powder creamer eating subway. Get your $$$ out !!!enjoy !!'
By far one of my favorite hotels and casinos!!!. . Seriously as good as it gets.  About six months ago I had some friends in town and we stayed here.  The rooms are beautiful as can be.  Everything is remote operated, which made for some laughs trying to get the curtains closed and the lights off at bedtime.  . . The place is clean and beautiful and I love the decor.  Very classy, very Asian inspired without being overwhelming.  They have a beautiful water fountain wall near the Valet that is worth seeing, even if you don't valet a car.  . . I love everything about this place!
I've stayed at Aria over 10 times and always find myself going back. The level of customer service I receive and the cleanliness of the hotel/casino are always perfect. I love the selection of restaurants especially the new 550 pizza. Highly recommend over Cosmo and Planet Hollywood.
Nice room. Nice view. But, I was expecting more. I appreciate that I was able to skip the insanely long check in line to use the "invited guests" desk - due to my M Life Platinum status - but that's the only special I received. The receptionist was all business and, as far as I could tell, I wasn't given a room upgrade.
Nothing to dislike about this place. All if the pools, restaurants, and activities are above and beyond.. Rooms are clean and very welcoming!! I would suggest this place over any of the big names on the strip any day..
Loved all of the modern amenities, the service/staff, and the bed was amazing! Onl downside was that for me, the location is not ideal.
I was staying next door at the sister hotel, but I wandered all over this Hotel.  There are beautiful gardens and art works all over the place.
Sunday on April, 13-14. I went to a high limit baccarat room at about 3-7:15am, (4+ hours of play). Then I "color up" chips. Within 4 hours I had "color up" chips. total $10,750 chips. I was tired and did not cash out then went back hotel room to rest up. That afternoon (Sunday the 13th of April). I went to a different Casino called Wynn Casino to watch a show. Before the show started in that Casino. I asked the dealer if I can play the chips that I used in the other Casino because I didn't have cash in my pocket. The dealer said I could cash out. The dealer also said to me that I need to go to the cashier to cash out. I went to the cashier and ask for sure if they accept these chips. The cashier said they accept these chips from Aria Casino. The cashier called by phone to Aria Casino to verify the chips for about a 15 minutes. After the phone call, the cashier told me to go back to Aria Casino to cash out. The cashier offered me to cash out my two $25 chips here. I told them I didn't want to cash it here. The next day at 8 pm ( Monday, April, 14-14). I went back to where I stayed at (Aria Casino) to cash out from the chips I played before. Some manager told me that I cannot cash out with these chips. I asked why I couldn't cash out. In reply, the managertold me that I couldn't cash out because that manager said that he did not see me play at Aria that Sunday morning. I called my friends that I went playing that Sunday morning to give that proof that I did play. My friend came and talk to the manager and still didn't believe it and told me that I still couldn't cash out. Then another manager Jennifer came up to fine out what's going on. She asked if I had tried to cash out at the Wynn Casino Sunday night. I told her yes, she was very upset when she asked me that. Jennifer told me that she saw me buy chip about 1-2 grand to play, but didn't see me "color up" Jennifer asked if I remember if I had  "color up" at that time. I said that I didn't remember. I straight up told her that I played 4 hours which is from 3am -7:15am and asked her to check the cameras from around that time I gave her. At first she said that she won't check the cameras. Jennifer asked if I remember the time I play, then she will check the cameras. So my friends was also with me and help me try to remember really hard what time I had "color up". I told her Jennifer that  about 4-5 in the morning I had "color up". Jennifer went to check, but she still didn't see me play there. Jennifer asked me one last time to really remember what time I had "color up" or she won't check anymore. So  I asked Jennifer since I can't cash out anymore can I still use these chips to play. In reply, Jennifer said I still use these chips, but cannot cash out. So I went back to my room with my friends to really remember what time I had "color up" because again she told us to really remember one last time or she won't check anymore. My friends and I really try to remember, but nothing came out of out minds to what time I had "color up". Then I called all my friends to tell them about my story. After I talk with all my friends. We went back to the cashier and try to cash out again. The cashier called the manager Jennifer. Jennifer asked me why did all of  my friends went with me and came all at once this time because it's all going to be the same story. My friends asked Jennifer if these are the chips are actually from this Casino and she approved that these chips are from this Casino, Aria. Jennifer keep saying that she still didn't see me play. My friends asked Jennifer  to check the cameras to see if I did play which she says it may take about 4 hours. She asked to give her some time to take a look at the cameras. I agree to give her time to take a look at it over. After at about 4 hours period of time she called me and say that she still didn't see me play. So now all I can think of is to call the police. At about 2:30am, I use the phone at the hotel where I stayed to call the police. Security of the Aria hotel came instead of the police. I ask the security why did they came instead of the police. The security asked if anything is wrong. So anyways I told them same story. I said that if this problem cannot be solve then I will just have to call the police and the news to tell them my story. The security took photos of all of my chips, myself and my friends for evidence. Security asked that if they can cash out my chips, then will I still call the police and the news. I reply, if security can cash out my chips then I will not call. The security asked me to give them an hour to solve this problem then they will call me back. About 1 hour later there's another person called me to ask me to come down to the cashier to cash out. I'm really angry and frustrated about all this happening at this Casino. I can't imagine what kind of Casino this big would do something like this. I've gambled at other different Casinos for years, but never seen a Casino like this.
The hotel rooms were nicely sized and clean.  The casino was a good size and some places to eat and go out, but not like the other casinos on the strip. . . Good central location on the strip, but you still need to take cabs everywhere unless you are a big walker.
Let's start by saying I am not a huge fan of Vegas. I don't smoke and I don't gamble. My husband had to present at a conference and wanted me to come with him. The resort is very beautiful and we had a very lovely view from our suite on the 33rd floor. . . The resort got my name incorrect on the account despite my husband put it on the reservation. My name is Kimberly and they listed me as Kira(?) not even close. This did cause a problem when I tried to charge my breakfast to the room the day my husband had to go to conference early. Luckily I had my Military ID that listed him as my husband because I had not brought a purse with me (no charge cards).. . The room has all of these high tech toys, that just never worked right. I wouldn't want them in my room but they came with the suite. If you give me a toy and it doesn't work you just lost points. . . Our TV located in bathroom did not work for the three days we were there despite turning it in every morning as "not working at all" to the front desk! Do I need a TV in bathroom? Not really but you have it in there so it should work, am I right?. . The volume on the living room TV did not work when we got there and they sent a nice maintenance guy up to look at it. The cable had broken off in some black box thingy that provided the sound. He said it happens all the time but he could put the sound back to the TV and they could replace the cable the following day. If a problem can be described as "it happens all the time" then you have a system failure and the problem should be addressed as such. Different cable, different sound box, educate the cleaning staff, or whatever makes the "all the time" stop! The cable might have been replaced but the sound continued to come out of the TV and was at a good level of sound - this was great because after that the sound could not be adjusted with the TV remote anymore. Now this is becoming a bang head here moment. . . The light switches at our bedside tables were reversed. I control my reading lamp and my husband' s table lamp. I turned this in as a problem the first day but it was never fixed and I had other things to do than sort out their mechanical mess ups. . . It is essential when travel to have a coffee pot in our room. We wake usually very early as we live on the east coast and wit the time difference- we can be up at 6am no problem. They call my husband back and said they have no coffee pots??? really? A resort your size and the price we are paying per night for our room and no coffee pots! Someone should go shopping for a few Keurig coffee pots and have them for guests who ask for them!! That would be a very small investment which would quickly provide a great ROI both in good will and giving the customer (remember us) what we want -coffee if we wake up at 6am. My husband woke at 6:30 our first morning and went to the Skyview suites' lounge and was told he could go out to Starbucks or another coffee place. My husband had his robe and slippers on??!! Who trains these people?! Did he look like he was dressed forgoing out in the main area of the hotel. It was bad enough you were making him come down 33 floors for a cup of coffee.. . The casino area was pro-ported to be a special area that even if someone was smoking the indoor air quality would be just fine. I am allergic to cigarette smoke - it was most unpleasant and cigars are always the worse. They should confine all cigars to a cigar smoking area, don't let them just walk around with them. . . Housekeeping did a wonderful job - everything was spotless. The turn down service was excellent. The furnishing were nice. The bed was very fluffy and the pillows were comfortable. The view was breath taking. The water and apples were nice in the Skyview Suite lounge. I don't drink soda and they had no limes for the Sparkling water. . . Maybe I am just getting spoiled in my old age but I have stay in as nice or nicer suites for a lot less money. I want coffee when I want it! And in my room, not 33 floors below me. I do not like cigarette or cigar smoke period.. . They escort you to your room -this is a frequent comment that people are impressed by. They need to get out more often, most places we stay do this. I am turned off by people who have to try to impress you. . . I wouldn't stay here again and I won't be back to Vegas. For the Aria our room number was 33022 so maybe you can get the problems with the TV and bedroom lights fixed before you put anyone else in there.
Just got back from here. Stayed Thursday-Sunday and would NEVER, ever stay here again! . Terrible service. Extremely rude employees who obviously hate people and their jobs. And the longest lines ever, everywhere and for everything!!! Oh, and there was a blood stain on the wall in our bathroom and gross stains on the carpet in our room. Unacceptable for the prices they are charging. You can stay in far better hotels in Vegas -- Bellagio, Venetian, Planet Hollywood...  anywhere!  . . A snippet of some the terrible service we received:  . . 1.) The taxi line took over 30 minutes- unacceptable. I ask the "director" if it usually takes that long (so we can plan our days out) He answers so rudely "uh yeah sometimes. i don't know. whatever" are you fucking kidding me??! And you still want a tip. It's ok. I called him an asshole. Which is what he is. a RUDE ASSHOLE.. . 2.) At Jean Phillipe Cafe, where an egg sandwich is $10 bucks (its fine, I get it everything is over priced in Vegas)  I asked politely "what sandwich doesnt have mayo." I don't eat mayo- it's a pretty simple question and request. The MANAGER rolls her eyes at me and says "It's all pre made. They all have mayo. If you dont like it you can eat somewhere else" Uhhhh ok. Way to take pride in your job!!. . Same manager at Jean Phillippe throws a sandwich on the ground, swears, and kicks it through the restaurant (no joke!) after my friend says she won't accept it because it didn't have egg inside it (like on the menu) and was not acceptable for her. WHO DOES THAT?????!!!! She literally kicked it all the way across the back counter and was visibly angry. . . GET A NEW MANAGER!!!! She is terrible. What an embarrassment. She should be ashamed of herself. Yeah, the MExican lady with long fake blonde hair. YOU ARE TERRRRIBLE. You have NO business being a manager or working with people !. . LONNNNGGG lines for everything. Line for taxi (over 30 minutes EVERY time). Line for coffee. Line for food. Line for bell desk.  Line to pick up baggage. A line For everything!!!! What the helll are we paying for??? Understaffed and over priced.. . Never again. . Isn't this the hospitality industry???  Be hospitable. This place blows. Total ripoff
Was in Vegas for a week for a conference held at the Aria.. . I stayed in 2 different rooms during my trip because the last half was for my birthday, so I can say that some rooms with the better view actually felt older...maybe just the color schema. Updated technology, comfy beds and great service. . . The 24 hour restaurant is pretty good. The bake shop has some scrumptious selections including chocolate croissants. . . The pool has a day club if you like that kind of thing. . . Right on the strip. Easy to get everywhere. The next conference a few months later I stayed at another popular hotel...I missed the Aria.
Let me start out by saying that my room at Aria Sky Suites was incredible.  We had a Aria Suite on the 54th Floor with a view over the pool looking towards Red Rock Canyon.  The layout, size, decor and technology in the suite was awesome.  Lots of automated lights and curtains for the floor to ceiling glass.  The bathroom was easily the nicest bathroom I have had in a hotel room.. . The restaurants in the hotel that we tried (bar Masa, American Fish, and Javier's) were all excellent (I highly recommend the happy hour bar menu at American Fish).. . The casino is a little cramped, but I never had a problem finding a table to play blackjack at, so it wasn't an issue.. . We spent two days by the pools, which are very cool, quiet and laid out nicely.  No complaints there.. . Here's where we get to the fatal flaw with this hotel, and why I almost certainly will never stay here again.  Service.  Like I said, we stayed at Sky Suites, which is like a hotel within the hotel.  It has a private driveway, private check-in, and private bars and elevator access.  You have a personal concierge, so the expectation is that you are paying for access and impeccable service.  Unfotunately, none of that is delivered.. . I booked dinner and brunch and car transport reservations a month in advance on the phone with the concierge to ensure all was perfect (anniversary trip).. . Upon arrival at McCarran, our driver that was supposed to meet us was nowhere to be found.  After three calls to the concierge, who each time swore he was right there, we finally met up with the driver, who proceeded to grunt at us, not offer to take our bags and trudged like a 10 minute walk to where he was parked.. . At check-in, the bellman took our bags and disappeared, not giving us a claim ticket, so our bags were AWOL for an hour and a half, requiring two callsto the desk to get our bags so we could changed to go out.. . I had ordered flowers and champagne to be in the room at check-in for my wife, they were there, they were beautiful, and the card was made out to me; not my wife.... . I had made specific reservations with the concierge to have brunch at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris and I wanted a outdoor table guaranteed.  I was told; done; taken care of.  When we got to our reservation; no reserved table outside.. . During the stay, every place in the hotel felt understaffed.  Long lines at everything.  Two days by the pool for several hours each day, and we not once could get a cocktail waitress when we needed one, instead needing to get up to go the bar every time.. . Lastly, and to me, most annoyingly was our experience at the end.  We reserved the car to take us to the airport.  We make a point to get In and Out Burger drive through on our way to the airport when we go to Vegas.  It's literally 1/4 mile from Aria and on the way to the airport.  The transport captain refused to let the driver stop, and told me the only way he'd approve it is if I had a casino host approve it.. . In essence, the hotel is beautiful, the rooms are amazing, and the service is not close to it. For the price point and the way they market Aria Sky Suites, I expected Ritz-Carlton like service.  I got the exact opposite.
HORRIBLE customer service. NEVER staying here again. I was SCAMMED AND OVERCHARGED at Aria.. .  Basically the Aria's policies were made up by incompetent people who have no way of ensuring that their guests aren't protected against wrongful charges on their accounts.. . Let me start off by saying, I NEVER order room service at hotels. Why would I do that when there are thousands of restaurants across the street? I never ordered room service the ENTIRE time I was there, but that didn't stop Aria from charging me room service! Not at all!. . They knew I did not order any food directly to my room. But apparently a person, two floors below us, ordered room service and told us to charge it to OUR ROOM. HOW IS THAT EVEN LEGAL OR POSSIBLE? How can you just tell the hotel to charge your room service to any random room who isn't even receiving the food? . . So at the end of our stay, we were shocked to see charges of over $200 on our account. We called Aria, and they explained to us SOME RANDOM PERSON charged room service to our room, even though it was delivered to a room two floors BELOW us. . . They said they would not transfer the charges to the OTHER room because some random stranger told them we would be paying for everything. LOL. AMAZING POLICIES!!!! If you would like to scam someone and get away with it, you should stay at the Aria! . . We would not let them go on the phone due to this absolutely ridiculous policy, and they said they would get BACK TO US TWO DAYS LATER. Yeah, right.. .  Management is disgusting and they should know better than to let their guests be scammed.
Horrible hotel. Oh god this place is awful. Will never ever stay here even if someone paid me to. I almost died staying at this hotel. Literally!. . This place is cheap, disgusting and dirty. It has disaster written all over this place. 2 years ago, their water was contaminated with some bacteria. Effing disgusting. I do not need to cite this because there is thing called google. Try typing "legionnaire bacteria and Aria" ! Effing disgusting!
Stayed at Aria on the 24th floor in a king suite with city view in April of 2014.. . We drove in from the Grand Canyon and my GPS brought me to the back of the hotel which also had a valet. Happily there was no wait at  all and the valet was just standing there waiting. It was a short walk across the casino floor to the check-in. The check-in lines were long and moved fairly quickly. It would have been nice to have some kiosks for guests who have visited the hotel beforehand, although not for me because I needed a map! I was surprised by the amount of money they hold on your credit card for each day stayed. I specifically book hotels on a credit card that has a low limit in case my CC number makes its way into somebodys pocket. This unexpected charge nearly put me over my limit and there was no mention of it when booking the room online thru their website. . . The room was fantastic. One of the nicest I have ever stayed in. The technology integration was great, there was basically an A/V wall for the TV so you could plug anything into it. Bathroom had a tub separate from the shower which was just lovely. The mini-bar was full of fancy items that were set on timers. I wish there was just a little space in there for a bottle of water. The major downfall of the room was the fact that there is no in-room coffee maker. Every morning I would wait on a loooong line at Starbucks for morning coffee and tea.. . We dined at Starbucks, the patisserie, Todd English PUB, and the buffet. . . We always found chairs at the pool however Friday we got there early, and it filled up by noon. The one pool that is close to Liquid their day pool club had way too much noise. The music from the club overflowed and mixed with the music from the normal pool which made things very annoying. We prefered the pool nearer the bar. The poolside service was good during the week but on Friday it felt under-staffed, hopefully there are more staff on Saturdays and Sundays.. . The gym was really great. Just like any gym it gets packed in the morning. Plenty of machines and kept very tidy with towels, water and sometimes apples. The key here is to grab two bottled waters when you leave for your hotel room. Their free!. . The spa was very lovely. Even though it was busy it didn't feel crowded. The co-ed areas were nice and the separate areas were even nicer. The mineral pool could have been a little bigger but it had a good view of the other pools as it sits on a ledge. The sauna and steam room were really big and the hot and cool tubs were a nice touch. My massage was great and the masseuse was very professional in accommodating my requests. . . The bell service helped us out big time. Our flight was a red-eye back to NYC and we had checked out of the hotel 9 hours before that. They checked our bags at the bell service so we could go to the spa. When it was time to get a cab to the airport they retrieved our bags and hailed us a cab. Even better was he let us skip the line of people waiting for cabs at the cab stand and hailed us one right in front. I gave him $5 and wrote the website about their great service.. . The Wifi... it     was      slow. Painfully slow. Of course you could pay more money for an upgraded connection. That is some balls. Net Neutrality took a punch to the gut at the Aria. At a 5 star hotel you expect the WiFi to be included and halfway decent. What am I paying the resort fee for?. . Overall there are very few flaws, having to go to Starbucks, sound pollution from the club pool, and holding money on your credit card were my biggest peeves. I came here on a personal recommendation, and I would suggest you check it out.
Our stay at Aria was entirely too short due to an issue at Chicago's O'Hare airport that shut everything down for a couple of hours and caused us to miss our connecting flight. As a result we were "stuck" for a couple of (fabulous) days in Chicago, and got in to Las Vegas late in the afternoon on a Thursday. We had to leave Saturday morning. What was supposed to be 4 full days and nights turned into 1 1/2 days and 2 nights...but we made the best of it.. . Our room was gorgeous. We were on the 19th floor and looked out onto the traffic circle with Vdara and The Cosmopolitan. The furnishings were contemporary and plush. I slept so well on that big bed! The bathroom was beautifully designed. I really liked how the key cards worked - you just hold it up against a circular reader above the door handle to unlock the door. No more sliding the key card into a slot and waiting for a green light.. . In fact, everything about Aria was gorgeous, well designed and tastefully decorated. . . We enjoyed the cafe and the buffet (those are reviewed separately), and had a very nice time at the Lift Bar on the casino floor, sampling cocktails with silly names (a "Monkey Gland") and watching people go by.. . We really enjoyed playing the slots. Lady Luck smiled down on us, but then Mr. Greed showed up and made us pour those winning into another machine. Oh well. Still, we had a good time.. . I'm shocked by some of the other reviews that complain about the service. I have no doubt that they had issues, but we didn't. Everyone we encountered was helpful and pleasant and there weren't any screw-ups like some others have had.. . This was my 6th trip to Vegas and I've stayed at a different place on the strip every time. Aria is the only place I've stayed that I would seriously consider revisiting on my next trip.
I have been here 3x and love it.  I play poker and wife does the pool with the girls.  Great poker room and no shortage of donkeys (me included) .  Love it and will be back
Me and my family goes to this hotel every time we go to Las Vegas and the rooms are just so stylish. They have great restaurants and their Cirque Du Soleil, Zarkana is just so much fun to watch. The pool is sometimes a little too crowded but it's really nice after all, and the casinos are a tad bit smoky and I don't want to breathe in cigarette smoke.
The Aria has done what many businesses fail to do - effectively deal with a complaint from a customer and then turn that customer into a loyal lifetime client. A few years ago I had a very specific issue with the hotel and wrote a complaint to the VP while highlighting all of the positives. I was extremely impressed with the response and it kept in the back of my mind. . . Fast forward 2 years and I was back in Vegas for a Bachelor Party and while most of the guys were staying at the Cosmopolitan I reached out to that VP to see if they could win me back. Did they ever.... it was an amazing 5 days at the Aria. As expected all of the restaurants were amazing, the room was beyond expectation and the service on all levels was what you expect from a top notch hotel. They have earned my trust and I will stay at the Aria from here on out. . . Now big deal you might say. Well I do go at least once per year and more importantly, the entire bachelor party group was so impressed with the Aria that we slowly started spending more and more time there instead of the Cosmopolitan. End result - a large group of professional men who all mentioned they'll stay at the Aria the next time they are their with their partners - pretty impressive work Aria andMr. Berry!
We previously stayed at the Aria when it initially opened and had the opportunity to revisit earlier this month and both times have enjoyed our stay. When you walk in, the open hall welcomes you and you feel like you stepped into a modern world. Outside the hotel there is a gorgeous waterfall that runs along the walls and the hotel exterior is surrounded by other hotel/business and lots of architecture.. . The slots don't pay out much and we lost a lot more compared to what we won, I'd say 10 times more. Tables are pretty pricy compared to the older hotels like Paris and Harrah's (which start around $10-$15 a hand) and start at $25.. . The one thing I do wish is that the hotel created an environment that would encourage guests to explore more with visuals or signs. We spent the first 3 days at the "front" of the hotel and had no idea there was an upstairs until we decided to eat the buffet on the last day. . . We enjoyed the buffet much and it wasn't overwhelming and had a good variety. Next time we will order the "inclusive drinks package-all you can drink" that is around $15. We were too boozed out to drink anymore on our last day as you can imagine.. . They do have a nice late night cafe that stays open but be WARNED! The night club in the hotel is very close to that cafe and you can hear the bass of the hip hop/techno/dance music as you eat, it can be distracting but hey, its Vegas.. . Great rooms, lovely bathroom, and a little too high tech for me with the gadgets but still a great room. They charged us $35 for a tequila bottle we didn't use and then reversed the charges when I called them to tell them we never touched it nor opened the bar. The bottle was still there.. . Tip: Try not to arrive on a Friday or Saturday as the front desk for check in gets busy.
Whatever happened to customer service? . . After driving for nine hours in traffic due to an oil and carrot spill on the I-15, I finally arrive. I get out of my car, and it turns out there's no luggage service on this side of the hotel. Great. So I walk my tired and sober ass over to the other side of the hotel, only to be greeted by a pissy front desk girl, whose time I'm obviously wasting. She barely makes eye contact as she curtly tells me the city view room I had booked is not available. But for the inconvenience, I'll be credited $50. Fair enough. I make my way up to the room, where the control unit is not working. I call front desk, and the same ray of sunshine answers. . . Me: "The control unit is not working.". Sunshine: " Siiiiiiiighhhhhhh...did you try the remote control?". Me: "No, but I think someone needs to fix this.". Sunshine: "Ok, siiiiir. I'll send someone up. Can I be any more of a rude *unt this evening?" Ok, I made the last sentence up. But you get the point.. . I've never had a front desk person be so enthusiastically rude like this, so I called a manager. But of course, he/she is not there and I can only leave a message. Probably one of a few thousand they ignore on a nightly basis. And as you can all guess, I never receive a call back. Oh, and the room was a disabled access(?) room, so you can't stand under the shower head without bumping your knee on the little chair. So that was awesome.. . Next day, I get moved to a city view room, which actually has a worse view than the standard room. And I also call hospitality to see if I can get some utensils. They wanted $1.50 per utensil. Nickel and dime, much? . . On Sunday, I finally check out, only to find out the $50 credit had magically been forgotten. So I complain, and find out that it was applied towards food and beverage. And I had also been charged $43 and tax for a Grey Goose bottle I moved in their fridge. If I had that credit, shouldn't it have been applied to the Grey Goose I didn't drink? When I mentioned that Sunshine never mentioned the $50 being a food credit, I was given my money back. And I also asked to speak to a manager in person, and all I got were a few disingenuous sorrys and nods. Worst $600 ever spent. Whatever you do, please do not give them your business. They do not know the definition of hospitality.
Update: Aria finally did give us a refund for the extra $200 on our account. However, I'm still shocked that something like this could happen in the first place and how they were reluctant at first to remove the charge.. . I'll now go on to review my stay at the hotel. . . First of all, check in line is LONG and looks like a line in Disneyland. Never in my life have I seen a hotel with such a long and slow moving check in line. Fortunately we went to the "invited guests" desk where there was no line, but they informed us our rooms were NOT even ready. It was 2pm. What the hell?? They said wait would be at least 3 hours. This was absolutely ridiculous because it's not like they weren't expecting us. I've never had to wait to enter my hotel room. MAJOR red flag.. . After eating at the awful pastry cafe in the Aria casino to kill some time (we were starving as well) we decided to gamble a little bit. The machines are nothing special and the casino is pretty small. . . Finally, after about two hours we were notified our room was ready. We had a room on the 26th floor. There are 3 elevator sections you may enter to get to your designated hotel room and the set up must have been created by someone who did not pass high school. The FIRST elevator section is for 1-15 (something like that) the SECOND is for 40-49, and the LAST is 16-39. It doesn't make sense?? Why are the numbers out of order??. . When we got to our room, i thought it was a pretty standard room for a 5 star. Beds were big, bathroom was nice, and we had a great view of the strip. Disappointed that they no longer provide slippers though! . . Also, the one thing that I truly was annoyed about was the TV!!! The remote would NOT work unless you nearly walked up to the tv. My relatives in other rooms also had this exact same problem so it wasn't like my tv was faulty. They need to update their systems. . . The gym was very nice and they provide you with towel service, cucumber water, and there are also lockers for you at the front desk. They charge you automatically $25 everyday for the gym whether you go or not (yeah, I know..) so you better make it worth your while!. . All in all, the Aria could have been a lot better than it was. I don't think it's deserving of a 5 star hotel title and I'd rather stay at somewhere a little pricier for better service and amenities.
Hotel is a rip off and will post bogus charges to your credit card!! I booked travel through a discount travel agency. While checking in, I was informed that they could not find the reservation, but would take care of it. After returning home and reviewing my credit card charges, I was shocked to see that hotel charged their room charge on top of the charges that I paid through the discount travel agency!! I never authorized these charges!! I have been charged more than double the posted online rate. I was told my credit card was only being swiped for incidentals and never signed for anything!! After calling the hotel they refused to refund the money. I am disputing the charges and filing a claim through the BBB!
Not sure it was worth the money.  Let me first start off the rooms are the bomb! Probably one of the nicest in Vegas with everything in the room being controlled by computer.  Pretty cool being able to open the curtains to look at the view from your bed.  Speaking of the bed...incredible....haven't slept so well in Vegas ever.. . So why the two stars?  Price gouging everywhere.  Our plane was delayed so we ended up getting in really late...to late to go looking for restaurants so we ended up eating at LemonGrass.  Food was okay but not worth the price. Great service but the food tasted like PF Chang's....sorry but true.  We walked out 100.00 later and not super impressed (do not mind paying for a good meal).. . Next day we went to spend the day at the pool.  There are 3 pools so we did not have a problem finding a chair and it was reasonably quiet (it is vegas) but when I asked for a pool menu I about lost it at the prices.....Most inexpensive sandwich was 18.00 without anything with it....drinks were out of control as well.  I know when you stay nice places food/drinks are expensive but to me the prices they ask are not in-line with the experience you get.. . It was a Saturday so as the day went on the pool behavior was enough to make this red-head blush! I know it's Vegas but there are some things I just do not need to see in daylight (especially if I am sober because their drink prices are ridiculous).  Decided to go up to our room about 4 before I saw things my eyes could not unsee....and seriously questioned if I wanted to get into the pool the next day remembering what I had just witnessed.  We were on the 23rd floor pool-side and I could not take a nap (it was going to be a long night) because the pool noise was so loud.. . We didn't eat there any other nights after the first night but had some cocktails inthe lobby and again WAY overpriced.  In the end I will say this the rooms are fantastic...no problem paying for them but keep the prices down everywhere else....no reason to gouge your guests.  The atmosphere outside the rooms just did not justify the costs.
