We stayed at this hotel in December 2013. The reception line to check in was the slowest ever; it took us two hours to meet the receptionist to start the check-in process and then had to argue for another hour to get a non-smoking room (although we had reserved a non-smoking room in advance).  We had to come back to the reception twice to exchange the keys, because the keys were faulty.. Overall, the room was clean and comfortable but the customer service was horrible and the staff were unhelpful. Also, they charge resort fees for the most useless services!
We were there for a conference in April 14. Our room was filthy. Trash behind furniture was from St. Patrick's Day. Rug was in need of replacement. Wouldn't stay there again.
Bally's was a nice enough spot to stay for our trip to Vegas for my 30th birthday.  We chose Bally's because the rooms had been comped by Total Rewards, and the location on the strip is good.. . The pros on staying at Bally's:. . 1. Easy access to other properties: Paris, Caesars, Bellagio, Cromwell, Tropicana.. 2. The room was comped, can't complain about that!. 3. Staff was friendly and helpful throughout our stay.. . The cons:. . 1. Our keys did not work the first time we tried to use them.  We had to have security let us into the room for the first time and get re-keyed.. 2. There was some miscommunication when it came to credit-card holds and pre-authorizations.  When we booked the room we were told that the pre-auth was $100.  As it turns out, it was $100 per night, which for us, was $300.  Additionally, because my boyfriend asked that I have charging privileges, they authorized an additional $300, plus some other charges we did not authorize.  We were able to get it straightened out with the front desk, but an up-front explanation would have been better and led to less frustration on our part.. . That's really it... other than that, it's a place to sleep and shower.  I did enjoy gambling there, the dealers and pit bosses were friendly and the casino was spacious.
Room is decent, spacious, clean.. I came here with my wife for our 5 year anniversary. We had a good time seeing Brittany Spears. . . No ironing board, for me I was pissed to find they charge for just about everything, gym yes you have to pay, safe yes please pay, WIFI should be WTF really I have to pay,. Oh and you gotta be joking me, room service stops at mid afternoon 1:00 PM.. Deal breaker will never stay here again.. The Orleans is off the strip but hell it's nicer, and easy to get comps for rooms.
We stayed here since the location is right in the middle of the strip. The front if the hotel is under construction so you had to walk around it and go along barriers to get out to the strip. When we came to check in for early check in like a ton of other people they told us the rooms weren't ready yet in our tower (we stayed in the jubilee tower which is recently remodeled) and they took our bags and told us to come back in a couple hours and then the lady gave us a coupon book and said we have an 'excellent' view. Well when we check in later to the room it's a view of the construction which was horrible. When the bell person delivered our stuff I asked why the view was so shitty. They told me to request to be moved to an odd number room since those face the paris pool, Eiffel Tower and the strip. I called and they finally transferred us and the view was great. Oh the coupon book they have us was 2 months expired btw. So the room was nice but there was dirty underwear in the corner and some weird marks above the bed which I don't even want to know about. The casino is ok, has keno and waitresses are good at bringing drinks if you play table games. Not fancy though, pretty old. Planet Hollywood is a couple casinos down and it's WAY prettier. Also some casinos must use a scented filter or something because they smell so good and ballys does not have that. It's was a decent stay all in all though.
Went here for a girl's weekend and was looking for something middle of the road and cost-efficient but not off The Strip.. . We got there early and had the option to pay $30 to check in early but there weren't any rooms available so we just dumped our bags with the bellhop (for free).. . When we did get into the room, it wasn't great. Asked for non-smoking room and it was like a cave of cigarette smoke and there were burn holes on the sheets on the bed. Totally tacky and gross. We called down and got a new room fairly quickly and it was MUCH better.. . THE GOOD. *Bed and pillows were fantastic!. *Room is huge, bathroom is huge, shower pressure is nice. *Location is really great--close to everything and there's a bus stop right in front. *The gym is FANTASTIC! Huge! Nice equipment! It's worth the $20. *The pool was really nice and fairly low-key. Still the party atmosphere but not totally douchey and it was never so crowded we couldn't get chairs. . *Casino was small but it was nice and looked newly remodeled.. . THE BAD. *The drinks at the pool are SUPER expensive and I don't think they actually put alcohol in them. WASTE OF MONEY. *The lady at the front desk was kind of rude when we were checking in but everyone else that worked there was super nice, so not sure where to rate this.... . I would stay here again for an affordable weekend trip. If I was looking for something a little fancier, I'd probably stay somewhere else.
Only positive is location..rooms old & smelled smoky, even though asked for non-smoking. Room was missing an iron & bathroom faucet had a broken handle. Rude check-in personnel & total rewards guy was no help & even ruder than check-in staff. So many other choices on strip, don't waste your money. Won't be back!
Early check-in fee was 25% of the daily cost of the room. Desk staff is unfriendly and surly. Room service: The continental breakfast was terrible, the turkey and avocado sandwich was huge and quite good.  The hotel amenities are just okay, nothing special, particularly when paying a $20/day resort fee. The only good service I received over my entire trip was from the bell staff. They were friendly and helpful throughout my stay. Fast forward to check out. I was overbilled at checkout for an upgrade for which I never agreed. After 20 minutes, yes I timed it, he comes back and says that the person who checked me in isn't there and they can't find my check-in record (sorry, but isn't this the digital age) but that they go through a very detailed check in procedure and he doesn't understand what happened. I believe I was just called a liar. Then, instead of apologizing for their mistake, he says "Sorry this is taking so long, but we're very careful when we're giving away money." Wow. Giving away money? How about rectifying YOUR mistake? Fortunately, I had a good cushion before my plane left. And fortunately I was too tired to make a scene, Needless to say, Bally's is off my list of future Vegas stays. This people is what happens when you cheap out. Actually, that's not true. I've had better service from a Motel 6.
Alright so me and my boyfriend stayed here for 4 nights! On a Saturday we checked in at about 2 pm. Everything went smooth we asked for a King bed got a room in the indigo towers, nice clean room, quiet the whole time. No complaints wish they had refrigerators but then again like WIFI that everyone is complaining about they obviously don't want you in your rooms playing on your phones or computers, bringing your own food they want you out on those floors spending that MONEY! Vegas doesn't get rich by giving free stuff away!!! But anyway the Casino sucked small & no winnings. Other than that staff was nice, security was friendly front desk just did there job, not going out of there way to be a smiling happy clown or anything but for the price and experience id recommend it to another!
Great hotel for the price. Much more affordable than other hotels, but you sacrifice some of the glamour.. . We arrived to Vegas at 9am. Check-in isn't until 4pm, but they will hold your bags for you for free if you arrive early. Watch for timeshare solicitors right when you walk in. If you want some free tickets, have 3-4 hours to spare, and can give a firm no, you could talk to them. If not, avoid wasting your time.. . You can get a mini-fridge for the room if you ask when checking in. We upgraded our room for $50/night, but we didn't really need it considering we never really spent time in our room. In retrospect, it was a waste (though might be something others would want). Room was clean and spacious. Safe was included (someone else wrote that they had to pay extra?). . Good central location on the strip. Drinks ARE a little expensive, but if you are gambling, they are generous with their comps. All in all, it balanced out. I wish night time room service was an option.
when you're in vegas, you think of two things for the hotel you stay in, does it have a moderately tolerable bath facility and bed to snooze in and where it's located in the strip. . ballys meets above criterias with a cheap affordable price, done deal, see you in vegas
You know when airlines started taking away all the little things that you didn't realize were little things that you appreciated before. Well, Bally's is like those airlines that has taken away all those little things that you didn't totally appreciate before.. . 1. Room service is only served from 6am to 1pm. One o'clock. In the AFTERNOON. In LAS VEGAS!! WTF?!?!. 2. Got back to the room at almost midnight my first night there and realized we were out of toothpaste. Most hotels, you can call the front desk and they'll send up a travel size tube of toothpaste. Not Bally's! My super-tired fiance, who'd been working a convention all day, had to go downstairs to purchase toothpaste. . 3. My fiance needed our last night there to be charged to his personal card since the other nights he stayed were going onto his company card to be expensed. The guy at check out made it seem like it was all taken care of but today, my fiance found out that they charged ALL the nights to his personal card. He's now been on the phone with them for 2 hours trying to get the issue resolved. . . This place should really just call itself a MOTEL.
Recently stayed in Ballys for my friends 30th birthday.the hotel is located directly in the heart of Vegas.Lovely clean rooms close to all the nightlife and great restaurants etc.Walking distance to everywhere you need to go.. I would stay here again as the staff and hotel is just perfect.The pool is very clean and has a great atmosphere.I need to Mention TJ the concierge he was amazing at booking us a trip to Grand Canyon ,letting us know places to see and do.TJ is for sure a valued key employee of Ballys and because of his professionalism and amazing advice we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday.Thanks TJ
Ballys is brilliant. It has the friendliest dealers of anywhere we went. It's really affordable, especially mid week. The rooms were nice and all the staff were friendly. . . If you're doing Vegas and don't care about being 5* Ballys is the best bet!
This is a review based mainly on their Hotel:. . First of all, don't expect to be ordering room service once here. The room service is open 6am-1pm. ONE IN THE AFTERNOON! I got here at a later time starving and tired, and I was basically forced to go downstairs to simply get food. Almost everything is overpriced on their menu as well. If 4 guests are eating, you gotta pay an EXTRA $5. If more than 4 guests are eating, it's an addition of $2 per person. Seriously. Once I got to the point of ordering room service the lady claimed some items weren't available until 11am, when clearly on the menu it states 6am. There were other people around me and the lady on the phone for room service was RUDE! She got all grumpy just because there were people talking in the background. . . Secondly, they practically make you pay for everything. The internet is $13.99 per device for 24 hours a day. For people who don't own a hotel room here, it's $9.99 for 2 hours. What a rip off. To work out at the gym, it's $20. Just to exercise. *sigh*. . Now to the actual rooms. The rooms itself are pretty gigantic. But, if you take a closer look at things it's EXTREMELY unsanitary/not cleaned. I found half eaten chocolate strawberries as well as a bag of pie in the fridge. It seemed like they were there for quite a long time... Random areas on the carpet were wet when I walked on it, which was a little awkward especially not knowing what it was. The furniture was covered in hair (not mine) and had stains throughout the sofas.  I sat on one of the chairs and there was crumbs of something on it. Ew! Also, this isn't really a big deal but the bathroom toilet paper and the trash cans weren't even changed on arrival. Ehh... . This IS my first time experiencing Bally's and I'm pretty sure it'll be my last. One star for this. I definitely would recommend any of the hotels around this such as Bellagio though.
I was pretty impressed with my stay at Bally's. We booked using the Hotel Tonight app, and my expectations were not high. One downside is that they share a parking lot with Paris. So if you self park you'll have a bit of a walk to the check-in desk. Checking in was the roughest part of the experience just because it took so long. We arrived at 10:45 pm and I didn't expect there to be a check-in line. I waited for about 40 minutes and everyone around me was becoming super grumpy. They did not have enough staff to check everyone in. There were only 2 people tending to the regular line, and 3 tending to the Platinum Member line. One I reached the counter though, the woman was super pleasant. She was able to quickly give me a room with 2 beds and add my friend's name to the room so that she could come pick up a key later.. . They did a very good job with the remodel. I was surprised when I saw our room! It was nicely decorated and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was all new and clean. There was a good amount of floor space, 2 plush chairs (that someone can combine to sleep on), mirrored table, a long dresser, and desk. BONUS: the room comes with a mini fridge! Our room had a view of the new Linq. There is a cafe downstairs by the elevators if you need something quick to eat. Bally's name doesn't hold a glamorous connotation but once you're inside you will be surprised. Plus, it is right in the center of the strip. You can easily get to any other hotel by a short walk or cab ride. I felt that the price here was fair and I will stay here again when I am on one of my non-extravagant Vegas trips.
