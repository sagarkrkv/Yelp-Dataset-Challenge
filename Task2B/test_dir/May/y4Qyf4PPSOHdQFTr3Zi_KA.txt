for me, personally, i'd give it 3 stars.  but overall, it's a 4 star property.  i've stayed here 3 times now...and very much like the guest staff and room itself.  and like others say, FOR THE LOVE request a room near the freakin' elevator.  unbelievable long walk from elevators from room.  my last visit a couple weeks ago, we were at the very end.  we paced the walk as 200 yards.  OH MY!  this is a conference destination, so many conference attendees are floating around.  best part of this place is the Starbucks just outside the elevators.  the room has an excellent bed and bathtub.  shower is a bit squished, but not the end of the world.  housekeeping staff didn't seem too friendly, and never said "hi" when you passed them.  which being 200 yards from the elevator you pass a lot of housekeeping!  would i stay here a 4th time?  ummm...we'll see.  if i get comped again, maybe i would.  this place can get pricey, on certain dates.  but for free?  i guess you can't beat the place.
Red Rock is quite sleek and modern for an off-strip casino.  The casino staff are friendly -- both the people at the tables and the ones that monitor the slots.  They have a good variety of games here, though not all of them.  The food court has the usuals -- nothing fancy.  I can't say I've tried any of the sit down places.
Terrible customer service!  NOT military friendly!  In - room service came 45 minutes late with our breakfast when we had to attend a conference in 5 minutes. Incompetent front desk that will give you a run around. We tried to speak with manager, but he was in a "meeting". Said he will contact us, but never did. Very disappointed.
Check in was a breeze and the front desk associate was very friendly.. . I was disappointed in the room.  The bathroom door slides open like a closet door and did not have any type of latch.  It just didn't feel private.  The sink and tub faucet has burning hot water, but the water in the shower doesn't get hot enough.  Weird.  The soaps smelled good.  . . The Wifi in the room sucked (11th floor)!!!  We called numerous times because it kept going down.  Each time the staff was friendly and resolved the problem, but within a minute of getting off of the phone it would go down again.  It felt futile to call more than the 5 times that we already called.  Wifi seemed to work fine in the rest of the casino.  . . This casino does not have an adult pool area.  Which stinks, because not only was the pool full, but we were only able to find chairs next to a pool with kids splashing away.  The chairs and cushions could use a facelift and the music was tired.  There was a employee stationed at the pool entryway that looked through your bags to ensure you did NOT bring in any open bottles of water, or any beverage.  No outside food was allowed.  I bought a pina colada that was was not good.  It was not horrible, but it was nothing special and I wouldn't buy another.  Also it was $2.00 more expensive than pina coladas that I have bought at the Wynn.  Even Redrocks's quesadilla was more expensive than the Wynn, and not half as good.  The service was slow.. . Lucilles and Yard House staff were super nice and the food was very good.  The free shuttle to the strip was also nice and the driver was professional and friendly.  Heck even the doormen were very attentive and polite.. . The new pit boss at 1 am was not nice and should probably be reminded that while he is there to protect from loss, he also works in the hospitality industry.  An hour and a half is a long time to wait between drink offers when you're gambling between $10 - $100 a hand.  Just say'en.. . Probably all of the employees I came in contact with were pleasant and accommodating, with the exception of the new pit boss.  The pool entry bag checker was friendly too, even though I was offended by the hotel policy of having bags be checked.  But hey, that wasn't his fault.. . If I had kids and was on a family vacation, maybe I would have been more pleased.  However, for a romantic get away in Vegas I would prefer to spend a few more bucks  for a hotel room on the strip and have access to the entertainment, and restaurant and shopping choices.  I don't believe Redrock was a value.
We had an enjoyable visit here and our experience with customer service was good. If you have little ones - this is a great place. . . For the kids:. The Kid Quest ("baby sitting") was wonderful - large, lots of toys and a fun play area (slides and stuff). The staff was very nice. They called to let us know that our little guy had a potty accident so I ran over there with diaper bag and change of clothes. When I got there - they had already cleaned him and changed him, they just needed a fresh pair of clothes. How's that for service! :) Additionally, it has a full bowling alley, and Regal movie theatres. The arcade wasn't impressive (it was okay for our little guy but would probably bore teens in less than a minute). Pools were nice. . . For the grownups:. Casino nice - the smoke wasn't too bothersome for us nonsmokers. Pools were nice. Lounges were nice. Only complaint is that they should have a band/entertainment in the Rocks lounge every night (not just Friday/Saturday) for those of us who would rather sit and listen to music with our drinks - not gamble or watch sports. . . Overall:. Nice restaurants, nice food court. Nice place.
Love this place and go every chance I get.. . I do have to admit I have never stayed in the hotel because I live locally, but the casino itself is beautiful, it has good restaurants: Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ, LB Burger (Delicious), The Yardhouse, a sushi place, I can't remember the name, and they have a lot of quick eating places too, such as Fatburger, Panda Express, starbucks, etc.. . Its a great place if you have kids.  There is a bowling alley, arcade and movie theater like most of the local casinos.  . . The Salon is awesome.  I have had my hair done by Jean Marc Levy several times and he does an amazing job.  You should know they only do one client at a time it seems, and they do an amazing job.  For me, I am kind of uncomfortable being the only one they are working on because I feel like a bug under a microscope, but they do an amazing job.  As far as color goes, he is the best.  He has also been voted the Best in Vegas, so its not just me.  The Salon staff is super friendly.. . The buffet is okay.  I have been there once and it is better than a lot of the buffet's I have been to in Vegas, I will say though that if you want to do a buffet correctly, go to the Wynn.. . I absolutely love the Red Rock.  It is one of my favorite places, and an interesting side note, the MIT Card Counters were eventually caught and taken in at the Red Rock.
This is one the best places to go if you don't like all the traffic on the strip. They have bowling and a Movie theater besides the normal casino things. There are a couple fair places to eat plus a huge food court. The gaming is your normal fair with all the games you could think of.
A nice place but they shut down Hachi. Restaurant. Went to have drinks at a bar that was suppose to be open but didn't have a bartender. It appears management in this place is questionable.
This place is awesome. The pool is awesome and the service is great. Resort Fee is now 27.95
Good place to stay if your not looking for the Vegas experience. After 11 pm it's dead and the waitress with curly hair at the "lucky star" bar is slooooooow. Waited 30 minutes for a drink in a dead bar.  Would never come back here if it wasn't where my company hosted an event.
I love it here. Went to the adult pool next to Cherry. The Dj was incredible, waitresses and staff were great. Loved their cobb salad and burgers. Mango mojitos were off the charts!!! Great place to rent a cabana, chill, drink and even play at the casino. Definitely would recommend the adult pool though!!!
This is a great hotel to stay at. The rooms are fantastic, modern, minimal, cool vibe to them. The square footage is good and the bathrooms offer both showers and tubs which I prefer. There is also a little tv above the tub which is cool. The beds are super soft and comfy, the pillows are amazing, and the linens must be at least 500 thread count or soaked in some sort of fabric softener. The room service menu is phenomenal and I swear you can get better burgers from room service than any restaurant downstairs in the casino. They are timely and bring the food in on a table like I prefer. This resort has multiple pools outback and a lot of seating but apparently others know how amazing the hotel part of this resort is as it's a pain in the arse to get 2 lounge seats together by any one of the pools. And there are usually too many kids... gggrrr... Other than that, love the hotel, the spa is nice as well and has a great little shop with lots of girlie goodies and spa products. If you're in this area of Vegas it's the ONLY hotel to stay in.
Highly recommend Red Rock. Beautiful resort off the beaten path. Outstanding service everywhere!  Clean and spacious. Hidden gem. Definitely check it out.. . Here are two examples of outstanding service:. We were a large group and wanted $10 blackjack on Saturday night of Memorial weekend. Pit boss let us play $10 minimum at a $15 table. Very cool of him. We played a long time; lost (ha), but had a great time!. . And the real test of A+ sercice... My husband locked me out of room, by accident(!), at 2 am. He dead bolted door and used safety latch. Front desk, security and engineering could not have been nicer. Number one concern was my safety. They ended up having to cut the latch on the door to get me in and as embarrassed as I was, thesecurity guard and engineer never made me feel bad. They were awesome and definitely went above and beyond!. . Can't wait to return this summer.
Haha! Well Red Rock rooms are simply the best in the west (side of town). Beautiful marble bathrooms, pretty much everything about the rooms were 5 star. The pool area was big, relaxing and unique. The Casino is nothing special. although it is also beautiful.. . They have a great selection of eateries as well......Id have no qualms about recommending this Hotel
if you have a family with little kiddos, this place is great.  they have restaurants, a bowling alley, movie theaters, pools all in the resort making it incredibly convenient.  also across the street from the resort is a shopping area with a Marshalls, Best Buy, Bed Bath and Beyond (etc).. . we only visited for a short time, and spent a few hours at their pool.  their pool is legit.  they have a shallow pool with a fountain smack dab in the middle for the lil ones.  they also have deeper pools towards the back as well as hot tubs.  cabanas and daybeds are also available at a first come first serve.  apparently, they started a day club as well.  not sure how well that would do considering the resort is more catered for families, but again, even without the day club, the pool area is on point.  really clean and maintained!  only about a 25 minute drive from the strip and if you're heading to from the strip you pass the premium outlet as well!. . would definitely stay here if going with the fam bam!
Red Rock is a beautiful casino/hotel option located outside of the strip. I often compare it to the M Resort, as it maintains a high level of cleanliness and customer service. There are a few very good restaurants located in the casino, as well as a bowling alley and a movie theater. The pool area is very nice, and the rooms are beautiful. Another bonus ... Red Rock Canyon is a hop, skip and a jump away. Great sightseeing if you didn't come here to black out the entire time.
Horrible customer service, didn't see anyone winning at all. Total waste of money and we didn't even have fun :-(
