I was with a group of about 12 so I was able to sample a few things on the menu. . Onion rings- melt in your mouth. . Brussel sprouts with bacon- tasty. . Fried rice (yes, fried rice)- was different with great flavor. . Calamari- cooked just right. . For the finale, the Kiki burger which was completely different than any other burger I have ever had and it was great. . The waitresses were efficient and friendly. Just make the drive off the strip, you will not be disappointed.
I was never into burgers until I tried this place, now I want to try every single one.   I've tried the Ronin, Kiki, and two others that I forgot the name of but they delish as well.   . . The OXTAIL FRIES are yum-to- ok, I think it's the sunnyside up egg that makes it special.  . . I'm very excited that they are opening up an L.A. location.   WOOT WOOT!. . The PORTUGEUSE DONUTS with COFFEE ICE CREAM are amazing!!!
First, as Southern California gal, I've had my share of vegas visits but I've only gone here three times and I think whenever I come to vegas, this place has to be a staple. Service is impeccable,  especially this last visit. . . There's nothing really more that needs to be said. Every visit comes with a wait but that just means that it's THAT good. Worth the wait and their cocktails are just good! Especially the katsu shiro! Can't wait for the next time I go, going to try another new burger.
This was an accidental find while looking for sushi, and I could not be happier. So good that we went back again! Service, food, and prices I thought were 5 stars. Fresh food, cooked perfect! If you are nearby, it is a must go!
Great service, AMAZING food, totally worth the 35min. wait for a table. . . Had the Parmesan truffle fries while we waiting for our burgers, they were fantastic. Perfectly and evenly good and excellently complimented by the condiments. Must try. . . Had the Ronin burger; it was superb. Perfect combination of sweet and savory. Full of flavor without being too rich to finish. The bun was fresh and nicely toasted, the patty was charred and delicious while still juicy and cooked to my specification, toppings were on point. Literally nothing to complain about.
I'm in love with this spot!. . Great food, great atmosphere! Although our last waiter didn't seem to thrilled about his bosses.... . Nevertheless I have spent many afternoons an evenings here enjoying wonderful food and will continue to do so along with recommend this joint to everyone I know.. . Get the black and green burger with oxtail fries. You're welcome.
Fancy burger joints are part of the Vegas scene these days.  One, in particular, is known not only for its gourmet burgers w/ an Asian twist, but also for its local ties:  Bachi Burger.. . Owner & Food/Beverage Director, Lorin Watada, is a transplanted local (Iolani grad) who now lives in Vegas. His cooking stints included Alan Wong's, Sheraton Hotels, Kahala Mandarin Hotel, & some 7  1/2 years as Corporate Chef w/ Roy's Restaurants, before opening  2 successful Bachi Burger locations in Vegas. The 1st location, just south of the Strip, opened in May 2010 in what was formerly a Dunkin' Donuts location in Windmill Plaza; the 2nd location opened in April 2012 in Summerlin, western Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=fIhDPCnCFfkcOHHi-jOJ3Q . . Having local ties, it is then not a surprise that the reasonably-priced burgers & food are prepared w/ Pacific Rim/Asian influences. Quality burgers are made from Wagyu & Angus beef (price range from $7.50 for an Angus beef burger to $26 for Wagyu beef/foie gras); steamed sandwiches (Peking duck in bao, pork belly); fish sandwiches; & even a Vietnamese "ban-mi" sandwich.  The sandwiches are served w/ Asian-inspired flavors & ingredients commonly found in Hawaii, e.g., miso goma dressing, shiitake, kalbi marinade, kimchee, furikake, lemongrass, hoisin mayo, mizuna, lup chong, unagi, & others. There are also appetizers & salads, w/ one of their popular dishes being the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries served with chili aioli & a fried egg. As much as possible, ingredients are natural, organic, & sourced locally.. . We loved the delicious burgers, as the flavors of the various ingredients just complemented each other. We had:. . - Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13.50). Came w/ chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, carmelized bacon, crispy onion rings.  There was no way you could eat this burger, or any of the other burgers, w/ the sandwich in your hand. I had to slowly dissect it to make it smaller; the onion rings were perfect crispy w/ a flavorful batter. The Wagyu beef just melted in my mouth & was so delicious w/ the egg, bacon, & furikake. The hamburger bun was also a winner - fresh Taiwanese sweet bun that is rich, buttery, & chewy w/ a nice shiny glaze on it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=ca3W5wdhrSem8ERFXnjI3g .  . - Spicy Miso Burger ($10.50). Came w/ red onion, Shishito pepper, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, fried egg, apple vinaigrette. Lots of flavor in this slightly spicy burger from the sweet, green, &slightly spicy Shishito peppers; bold & salty flavors from the miso; & a sweet, tangy oil/vinegar flavor from the vinaigrette. The same Taiwanese bun was used to make it even more flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=6pgTs0isXtKI5nXRLSfe3g . . - Salt & Pepper French Fries ($4). Garnished w/ slices of hot Jalapeno peppers, Maui onion sea salt, & garlic chili aioli & served in a classy stainless steel cone. Thin fries that are perfectly fried, crisp on the outside & moist on the inside, & seasoned perfectly.  The aioli was perfectly spiced & creamy for easy dipping; we also enjoyed dipping them in a tasty pineapple-tomato ketchup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=I6fySTopYSja57efTht35w . . The restaurant's name, "Bachi," takes on a dual meaning:  a shortened version of the word "hibachi" which is a style of grilling; & a Japanese term meaning karma, i.e., to treat others how you would like to be treated & implied in a negative way. (I assume the name is more in line with the grilling aspect rather than negative karma.). . Service was adequate for this clean, contemporary 75-seat restaurant w/ exposed pipes on the ceiling to give the decor an industrial look. There are stylish recessed & track ceiling lights hovering over classy dark wood tables. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=KJAhWE22AH5ShHamqwWWOQ.  . Bachi Burger was featured on the Food Network on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives w/ Guy Fieri. This stint has helped to generate the crowds that it has been attracting.. . I would love to return to try their other burgers/sandwiches/sides. Hawaii residents will love the Asian twist to these burgers/sandwiches, as the ingredients are all too familiar here.  A must-do for Hawaii residents traveling to Vegas or better yet, maybe a Bachi Burger in Hawaii?
Bachi burger is worth the wait if come to this location.  I order the Kim Chi Burger. I love this burger and stick with it! ordered with the Garlic fries. The Burger Is Meal By Itself. Nice Thick And Juicy!!!!!
We ALWAYS take our visiting friends here, without fail. Asian fusion burgers never tasted better. I love their taro bun burger as well as the banh mi burger. My husband's go-to order is kiki's burger. Since we've started going there about a year ago, they've added a multitude of appetizers and desserts, probably due to the hours extension and additional bar. For the exotic beers they offer, I can see the draw in that. My family and I, however, have only eaten their for lunch or dinner. . . We've never had bad service. Beware of wait times, though!
Let's just say I'm from San Francisco and I make a trip to Vegas 2-3 times a year and it's now going to be a tradition to go to Bachi as part of our itinerary. THAT, or I'm not leaving until I get my Bachi fix!. . It's SO WORTH the trip away from the busy strip of Vegas. I've always loved Asian fusion burgers mainly because of the execution of pairing Western ideas and concepts with Asian sauces and marinate. I love the Ronin and Banh Mi burger; both had distinctive flavors but was not overwhelming! The burgers had key ingredients that were so proportionate and was just perfect with the moist patties and soft baked buns. I also tried their oxtail fries; yay for the topped fried egg. What isnt better with a fried egg?!. . I wish Bachi expanded to Norcal. It would be a HUGE hit! Until then, I'll have to order two burgers each visit in order to try all their burgers. I said it Bachi -- you guys are worth the calories. I'd get fat for ya. . . Bachi Faithful! :P
Alright, I will say the food was very good. However, the problem I had was with the drinks and the price.  I ordered a 5.00-7.00 bottle of beer.  The server recommended the "special" which was a glass (about 16 oz) of Japanese draft beer.  I took it. Well, I got the bill, and it was $10.50 for that glass of draft beer. The server failed to tell me it was 10.50 and I would NEVER in a million years think that a draft beer was going to cost me more then the burger.  I think the server should have communicated that the "special" was as pricey as it was.  Its things like this that will keep me from going back, as I feel I was mislead by the word "special."  Also, my friend was eating from a second plate and they came up to the table about 3 times while she had food on the plate asking if they could take it away.  Slightly annoying being interrupted several times when food was on the plate and not pushed away.
Waitress could have been more knowledgeable with the beers and items they did not have that day. JUST LOOKS BAD ALL AROUND. BUT FOOD IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great job kitchen staff! If the patio was wiped down daily I would be there more often. In windy dusty Vegas I understand, but it really should be done BEFORE opening. It gets very very busy and it's NOT a large place. Off hours I DO suggest! ENJOY, i do! . I WISH THEY OPENED an hour earlier!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't be like everyone else. GRAB that extra hour!
Great food and service!  Amazing is all I can say.
We were told it was going to be a 15 minute wait but waited at least 30.  My overall rating is highly satisfied.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and cannot wait to go back to Las Vegas just to eat at this place again.
My hubby and i love the kiki burger
Our first stop and Vegas and what a disappointment. We had 12 people total, but decided to get seated separately so we wouldn't have to wait as long. First party got seated in 40 minutes after writing our names down while the other party waited outside anxiously. I was in the 2nd party. I was walking in and out to check on my friends and I saw plenty of tables leaving and clearing up. After like 20 minutes, I asked how long the wait will be and the hostess didn't know.. . I see my friends got fries but no burgers yet. After another 10 minutes, we see so many EMPTY tables so we ask if we could get seated. We even pointed at the empty tables and they told us we will get seated when they were ready... 10 minutes later, we still didn't get seated and our friends that were seated earlier didn't even have burgers yet. . . We all left and went to the Subway next door. What a joke
I love how this place is open until 2AM! It's a great place to satisfy those late night cravings for foie gras! *. . We ordered:. . 1. Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries ($11.50). Oxtail is so good! The braised oxtail fries come with garlic aioli sauce along with a fried egg. The fries are very savory. Some people might not like it because there is a hint of sweetness. My defense is that it's supposed to balance the overall taste and not make it uber salty. A must try! (5/5). . 2. Shogun Burger ($25) . I only got this because of the foie gras! Get it while you can since who knows when the government wants to make it illegal as wellin Nevada! The burger has delicious Wagyu beef and unagi (marinated eel), pan-seared foie gras, miso butter, and poached Asian pear. . . The server told us to eat the Yamamomo Peach first (it's in a little cup) because it's supposed to cleanse our palates to fully taste the foie gras and burger. Neat! Overall, I really liked the foie gras. However, the combinations of the other elements made the burger taste too sweet for me. I felt like they could do without the pear and the unagi. The foie gras was the saving factor. (4/5). . The place is located way off the Strip, so be prepared to make a bit of a drive (not too bad though). The service is friendly and there's cute art decor around the restaurant. There are other yummy burgers on the menu that I would like to try again next time. =)
I love love love this place!  My parents also love this place!  Every time they visit Vegas, we have to go here to eat to fix their cravings!  . . So here's a little scoop on Bachi burger....the owners are from Hawaii so they know what flavor is all about!  Their burgers are not your ordinary burgers you find at some plain old American place....no, they add some Asian essence into each of their food items!  From the Miyagi burger topped with a fried egg and furikake to a kimchee kalbi burger that is to die for!  . . Not only are the burgers BOMB, but their appetizers satisfies each and every one of those taste buds on your tongue.  A few of my favorites include the oxtail fries (which is a MUST order), the arabiki and kurabuta sausages, and even the duck skin and pork belly buns!  . . I was born and raised in Hawaii, and us Hawaii peeps know that food in Hawaii is the best!  Living on the mainland sure makes you crave things you can only get back on the islands. Bachi burger is the perfect place to fix someof those cravings!   . . I cannot wait to go back and try a new burger!
I was disappointed by my visit to Bach Burger for the first time. We took out of town guests here telling them how great it is. We waited 45 minutes for a table. I m so confused what happened to the Spicy Miso burger. I have had it a couple of times at the Summerlin location and loved it! This time the burger was smothered in a red sauce that tasted very similar to the sauce on the Kalbi burger. My friend got the Kalbi burger and although I love spicy, kimchi, and kalbi, that burger just did not have a good flavor. The sauce was something like a Sriracha sauce but overpowered the entire burger. . . Also, I have tried the Truffle fries here and don't like the taste. The salt and pepper fries have a strong pepper taste and among 4 people we did not even finish 1/3 of the fries. The sweet potato fries are the best among the fries choices but the dipping sauce it comes with is gross. Way too sweet and strong of a taste, not complimenting it at all. . . I don't know if it was an off night or the chefs are just not as good or ingredients used were different. I really don't know why the experience was so different from the Summerlin one. We are big Bachi Burger fans and tell people we meet everywhere to try it and it's too bad this was a bad experience for the high price.
Our Canadian cousins LOVE this place and definitely put this place on top of their list to visit. My first time -- and I already want to come back! Excellent burgers. Truffle fries. Oxtail chili fries. Superb!
I have a confession to make..... . I ended up here because of Guy Fieri.... . I think that automatically makes me a douchebag and I ask your forgiveness.. . Finished off our quick 2 days in vegas with a trip to Bachi burger before driving back to my beloved city of angels.  45 minute wait on a Friday afternoon...could have been worse.  In terms of service...they must have been having a bad day...because it was gawdawful...I was mildly annoyed when I saw other diners getting ALL of their food even though we were seated before them..and we sat there with nothing...the wife was furious..staff was semi apologetic at least.  Anywho, on to the food.. . OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtg#O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtg. . Quite simply amazing.  These are 5 star chili cheese fries...ridiculously over the top oxtail chili topped with cheese, jalapenos, cilantro and chopped scallions, garlic aioli and a fried egg.  Delicious Insanity.. . MR. MIYAGI BURGER. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtg#Y6ftK1iLFQuSN5gC0VF2-w. . Incredible burger!  Chili Mayo Fried Egg Furikake. Caramelized Bacon Crispy Onion Rings...I made the wife uncomfortable with the moans of pleasure emanating from my food hole.. . CLOSEUP. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=O1CpKjHzM2VT5N2R7dwGtg#Dnd1xg9xjuwD5C2MD6xG_A. . yes.. . I don't care how big of a douchebag Guy Fieri is....if the food is this damn good....consider me an honorary douchebag for life.
Ok, so I love a good burger...so the fact that his place has an EXCELLENT burger? Wow. Drooling. Every special burger is mouth watering. They don't skimp on toppings and the quality of the meat? Winning.. . I added a sunny side up egg and avocado to my burger and it was amazing...I am currently drooling and itching to go back at this very moment. All you need is the burger, although I do want to try to the pork belly!
Hurray for Bachi.  Love the shogun burger here.  What kind go wrong with Foie Gras, Eel, and asian pears topping?  Nothing.  Especially enjoyable after two huge misses at Caesars Palace (Gordon Ramsey Pub and Serendipity 3).  We stopped here for lunch before heading back to Los Angeles on Saturday.  Service was fantastic (from a super cute waitress).  The only drawback was that the unagi was a bit "chewy".  So, I am wondering if that was undercooked.  But, I was so greatful so such yumminess, that I am upgrading my rating to 5 stars.. . Food:  4.5 stars. Service:  5.0 stars
Being in a strip mall didn't make this place easy to find. Google has it facing the street but the entrance is on the opposite side. The lunch crowd was in full force when I get there. I was seated in a table for four. They don't allow eating at the bar! I felt guilty of taking up all this space when people were waiting to be seated. So I sat not facing them. Screw 'um. At any rate, I ordered a Japanese beer I've never heard of. I forgot the name but it came in a 17oz bottle. Very good beer, sorta hoppy between an ale and an IPA. Then I had the Spicy Miso burger. Wasn't spicy at all. Maybe they missed something. But was cooked perfectly (med) and had the miso taste just right. It comes with an egg so prepare for some messy eating. I didn't have any frys and stuff but I'm sure it'll be just as good as the burger. Next, I'm going to try the Hotdog. The guy next to me had one and he said it was great.. There's a Ramen place next door. You can actually order Ramen too! The Ramen place wasn't nearly as crowded as Bachi so I wonder if I can order the burger from the Ramen place. This place beats BurgR and B&B in my opinion.
Everyone must try this place.. .  My friends told me about this place, because they couldn't stop talking about how great their burgers and fries and pretty much everything on their menu were. I must admit I am one of the biggest fan. After dining here, I've been telling everyone they must come to this place.. . From truffles on your fries, Foie Gras, and Delicious mouth-watering Burgers and so forth. I can't say enough..  . Their quality of food is top notch.!!! I am in love with this place. . . this place has also been on the Food Network Channel Dine-Dinners and Dive In with Guy Fieri
I am sorry, if I am dining here for a $26 burger, then my order should be taken in less than 15 minutes after being seated. This place is going through changes again by incorporating  the Ramen  next door which is not good. It wasnt busy at 1015pm on a Wednesday night, come on at least Inn n Out burger consistently delivers. Also, bad lighting in this place now.i
Don't waste your time.. . Tons of great reviews inspired me to try this overpriced burger joint.  I should have known from all the reviews from tourists saying they came here from the strip.  I suppose if you're used to boring overpriced food in Vegas casinos, this place is a step up, but with so many great choices in Green Valley just 5 minutes away, this place doesn't even make the bottom of the list of places I like to eat.  I won't be back.. . The oxtail chili cheese fries, meh, I've had better.  What's all the hype?  Mediocre chili heavy on the beans and light on the meat.  Fries were run of the mill boring fries, and the jalapenos not spicy at all.. . My wife had just a plain burger with mayo and onions for $16.  She liked it, but it definitely was not a $16 burger. . I had the Shogun burger...it was gross.  I removed the overly sweet pears and it was moderately better.  Not a $26 burger for sure.  Way too sweet.... . But that seems to be the recurring theme: every single thing on the menu it seems has a sweet flavor.  So if you're craving a juicy, meaty, savory burger, avoid this place.
AWESOME find.  One of those,  how did we get there? Im so glad we found this place, kind of experiences for my group of 4.. . Service was great- our waiter was funny, attentive and CRAZY fast.  We shared a few plates including the shishito peppers, ocotopus balls (not the best but not bad), onion rings ( AMAZING, we should have ordered 4 orders instead of 1) and we each got a noodle bowl or a burger for our mains.. . Borth was delish of my noodles and the noodles were good, but the chewier ramen from the dish with the XO sauce had better texture.  Pork belly pieces were like bits of porky heaven- honestly it was very memorable and delicious.. . Cannot stress enough how good the onion rings were.  As a bit of a onion ring connoisseur I have to say they rank at the top of my lifetime list, and they were incredible inexpensive.. . MUST GO BACK!  You need to go and try this place out, now :)
Tried this place for the first time and what a horrible experience. Got there at 640pm and there were 4 to 5 names in front of us. I asked if it would be alright to hang out at the bar area and they come and get me when my name is called. I ordered at the bar and the guy asked if I was eating there or waiting for a table and I said table. While waiting the bar guy who served us went over to the hostess to let her kno and we all made eye contact at that time. While waiting i noticed people we saw who came after us were seated before us. I went over to see what what the deal was amd everyone ahead of us were crossed out and seated and my name my crossed out too and re-writtten on the side. I asked why i wasnt seated and she said they were about to call me now. I wasnt seated until 725pm. There were about 13ish tables and we ordered the salt parmasean fries, the duck bao, and the spicy miso burger. Fries didnt come out until 35 min later followed by the other two 10 min after. Fries were whatever, the burger was okay (meat was bland without all the additives in the burger), and duck bao were good.
Damn this place is da bomb!  I wasn't really up to trying it but when I did, I was glad I went with my friends.  It's a small place but has tons of options to choose from.  Came in hungry left full and was still thinking about it a week later.  My friends and I want to get back to Vegas just to get back here.
I had the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries as featured on Diners, Drive-In's, and Dives. Awesome!  The burgers are super delicious as well and really great service.
Came here for a quick lunch with my fiance between meetings. Wish we had time to enjoy the place more. Great vibe and excellent food. The Ronin burger was awesome. A better burger than Umami in LA, which GQ votes the best burger in the country a few years ago. Will be back. Maybe this week.
Food was pretty good, but service wasn't. The hostess looked like she hated her job. We were not greeted or even given a smile. She barely even made eye contact. As for the food:. . - Kalbi Burger- 5 stars. I got it without the kimchi and it was amazing!!. - Banh Mi Burger- 4 stars. It was pretty good, but the combination between hamburger and Banh Mi was a little too weird for me. . - Truffle Fries- 3 stars. Nothing special.. - Duck in steamed bun (forgot what it was called) 1 star. Tasted like all of the nasty parts of the duck were used. I could barely bite a piece off. It was chewy and bland.. . Back to the service, it was a really long wait for our food to come out. There were a bunch of empty tables, yet the the wait to be seated was about 30 minutes. It looked like there was only one waitress on our half of the restaurant. For a weekend, they should've been more prepared.
Love to eat here.  Friendly service and good food.  Veggie gyoza is very tasty! Of course the burgers are awesome!  Make it a destination when you want something different!
I've been here several times now and constantly come back every time I'm in Vegas! I always have a hard time deciding which burger to get cuz they're all good but I think my favorite is between the Kiki and Ronin. The truffle fries are DELICIOUS too!. . I honestly was not too fond of the oxtail fries... It was a more heavy dish. Their version of a chili cheese fries. But they have soooo many great dishes I still think they deserve a five star! ^^
Food is good but the service is not . . I love their Bahn Mi burger . My son likes the  pork belly in a bun.
This is a great place, especially for the price. It rivals Holsteins and BurGR for quality, but at a better price. Our server was very friendly, patient, and answered my multiple questions about their different sauces. We shared the egg onion ring burger and the mushroom burger. Theywere both awesome - even my son's burger was surprisingly good for a kids' burger! My son scarfed his whole burger, and he is usually a slow eater. The truffle fries were great with the mushroom sauce and sun dried tomato aoli. The spiked milkshake was good too, a little strong, but who would complain about that?! What's not to love about grass-fed wagyu beef, funakoke seasoning, Vietnamese mint... It was a blend of happy ingredients having a party in my mouth.
Bachi Burger is a staple in bringing flavor and culture in Las Vegas.... . This was a to-go order that consisted of the Miyagi burger and the infamous oxtail chili fries.... . Miyagi Burger: teriyaki glazed medium rare grass fed wagyu beef, chili mayo,  fried egg, furikake (seasoning you put on rice), bacon, and crispy onion strings...plenty of flavor in this burger...you have the sweet, salty, and savory...excellento. . Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: honestly I have 5 stars in this review when I really mean for it to be 4.5...The reason why are the fries...it probably has everything to do with me taking a to-go order however the fries weren't as dank as the other times I had them...since it was a to-go order they separated the chili in a different container from the fries, jalapenos, cheese, fried egg, and cilantro. ..The fries for some reason were dry and hard...The chili is great as usual...very sweet and savory...These fries definitely taste better if you have them at the location...I forgot to mention the order size seemed smaller than usual. . All in all if you never been to Bachi Burger I recommend trying it at least once...I know fusion cuisine ain't for everybody but for the majority, it is..
Came in after searching Yelp for a burger place. And WOW! GLAD WE DID! We had the build your own and added an egg which was phenomenal!  From the patty to the bun everything was fresh and tasty! We also had the pork belly sliders and some truffle Parmesan fries which were also amazing. Then we had the Portuguese donuts which were.served with coffee ice cream!  Yummy little fried dough balls rolled in cinnamon sugar! Be heading back there in a couple days..it is that good!
Burgs! Nothing better than a good burg. Bochi produces a pretty notably good one too. I enjoyed the oxtail fries more though. Those things are nuts...it's sweet and spicy and meaty and cheesy. Everything you could ever need to make your taste buds dance! It's a huge portion too. We split it between 3 people and were stuffed before our burgs even came out. . . I don't recall the name of the burger I got but it was one of their popular ones with onion strings, fried egg, and ca realized bacon. Oh that bacon! So good. They cooked it medium rare perfectly, which I always appreciate. It was super juicy when I cut into it. In all honesty though, it didn't have a ton of flavor. I thought the spicy mayo would come through more. The bacon was the best part. And the bun was super good too. Really fluffy and slightly sweet. . . Definitely a place to try! Everything's got a bit of a Japanese twist so it's interesting.
Went here after seeing this place profiled on one of Guy Fieri's programs on The Food Network.  This is an out of the way place for me.  The drive wasn't particularly worth it for me.  When we got there, the wait wasn't that long, considering it was a holiday.  Service was ok.  The burgers were spot on...very tasty, but I wouldn't drive here again.  Still deserves a 4-star rating, though.
Arrived at Bachi Burger and waited 15 minutes for Saturday afternoon lunch.. . Sat down and declared that I saw their episode on DDD and was fasinated with their menu. . . Started with. *Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11.5 (With Garlic Aioli ,Fried Egg) [5 of 5] - Wasn't expecting much from putting stewed oxtail over fries. I was so surprised how delicious the oxtail was. I under-estimated how different and tasty this dish was. The oxtail actually had really nice heat flavor and by far, one of the best chili fries dishes ever.. . Finished with. *The "Banh-Mi" Burger $9 (Angus Beef ,Pork ,Shrimp ,Lemongrass,Pork Pate ,Fresh Herbs ,Curry Aioli,Pickled Vegetables ,Nuoc Mam Sauce) [5 of 5] - Wasn't expecting this to taste so good, but blown away at how well all the meat flavors blended so well. And dipping the burger into their housemade fish sauce, took it to another level.. . This place can brag about their burgers all they want, because it is all that. I think this is probably the best and most creative tasting burger places by far.
It was so bomb I had the kiki burger and truffle fries!!! Apple lychee soda was good too..our server was really nice..I wish I had gotten her name.. The AC wasn't working but I won't let that affect a review.. My main thing is good food and service.. Mechanical glitches happen...
My first experience at Bachi was no fluke.  I came back for another Bachi-style lunch on my most recent trip to Vegas, and every expectation was exceeded -- all thanks to a friend named Miyagi-San.. . Who exactly is Miyagi-San, you ask?. . Only the BEST DAMN BURGER IN THE UNIVERSE.. . A perfectly cooked, grass-fed Wagyu beef patty.  Fried egg.  Caramelized bacon.  Onion rings.  Chili mayo.  These glorious ingredients are what you can find on the Miyagi-San burger.  They come arranged in a vertical tower of architectural splendor.. . The Miyagi-San burger pairs perfectly with a plate of Bachi pickles.  The umami of the burger plays in perfect harmony with the sour tang of the vegetables.  Every bite is heaven.. . Meals like this are the stuff gastronomic dreams are made of.  If burger-induced ecstasy happens to be on your bucket list, a visit to Bachi is a must.
One of the best casual places I've eaten at in recent memory. When I heard "Asian-inspired burgers" I was scratching my head, but man, does this place knock it out of the park.. . My husband and I shared the pork belly buns - sheer perfection with an absolutely addictive dipping sauce. We also split the Kiki  burger, which is topped with a garlic chili aioli, caramelized bacon, sauteed shitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, a sweet onion marmalade and melted Gruyere cheese. The burger is glazed with a delicious coating and came together beautifully. . . The food was so good, I was still thinking about it the next day and craving more. I would love to go back next time I'm in the area!
Discovered this restaurant from Triple D on the Food Network. The burgers are fantastic and I woudl highly recommend the Oxtail Chili Chesse Fries...YUM YUM!!!
Cool twist on burgers! Most of the specialty burgers have some Asian influence in the ingredients. We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries topped with a sunny side up egg that were off the hook but a tad bit on the salty side. Can't go wrong with all the ingredients but put together YUMM!. . Ronin Wagyu burger: onions, Japanese cole slaw, fried egg and Katsu BBQ. Great burger with a Japanese twist and the buns seem like the bread used in a Chinese baked pork bun. . . Miyagi Wagyu burger: another burger with Japanese influence. Fried egg, furikake, bacon and onion rings. C'mon that sounds good right?. . Both burgers have some sweetness due to the sauces they add so they are a little sweet and savory. Kinda reminds me of the Fathers Office burger joint in Santa Monica, Ca. Gotta try when you come to LV.
BY FAR THE BEST BURGER PLACE EVER!. Came here because a friend of mine told me this place was a MUST. And it sure is!!!
Great way to end a Vegas trip, limited selection for Vegetarians, but they have a delicious Veggie Burger, that is SO HUGE. I could barely finish half. . . My friends started their meal with the oxtail fries & I have never seen such a happy trio! They devoured the fries. . . The veggie burger flavors were fantastic! The actual patty tasted fresh and one of the best I've had.  It wasn't too dry, and the flavors were a great mix! There were bits of red bean & walnuts tucked inside the patty as well.  The patty was paired with fried eggplant, fried tofu, fresh greens and lemon aioli. The bun itself was so fluffy & light!
Solid lunch/dinner spot for all burger lovers. The wait can be pretty long during peak times, but that's because there aren't many seats in the restaurant. However, the hostess gave us great comfort by constantly checking on us and giving us frequent updates. I greatly appreciated that and wanted to make sure I called that out. The wait staff is also very good. They are constantly coming around and turn tables as quickly as they can. No complaints there.. . In terms of the burger, it's a mixed bag. I got the Wagyu Burger & it was tasty. You can tell the beef was high quality. It was tender, juicy, and filling. My brother and father had the Ronin Burger & Kim-Chee burgers. Both were interesting as "must-try once" type of entrees. The Ox-Tail Chili Cheese Fries were average. They were standard chili cheese fries, but we couldn't really taste the Ox-tail. Nevertheless, this is a great place to try if you can venture off the strip.
Looks great. In reality, not so great.. . My party of 8 didn't enjoy it. And we really wish we did given the long wait we had to endure. Overrated and overhyped -- and not to mention far!. . Next!
Bachi Burger is easily THE BEST custom burger restaurant I have ever been to, and I miss it dearly now that I live in the Bay Area. I've had dreams about this place, and the withdrawal levels are running high, at this point.. . My wife and I used to live pretty close to the Windmill location, and we frequented this location about a dozen times. We've tried a number of the burgers there, as well as the oxtail chili cheese fries ($11.50) as an appetizer. These oxtail chili cheese fries are amazing. They have garlic aioli and a fried egg on top of fries with oxtail pieces on top of it... incredibly tasty, even if you aren't traditionally an oxtail fan.. . With regards to burgers, my personal favorite has always been the Kiki's Burger ($10.00). I recommend this burger if you are a big mushroom fan. This burger is packed with sauteed shiitake, enoki and eryngii mushrooms in it with caramelized bacon, a sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, with a garlic aioli spread. One of the unheralded parts of their burgers is the amazing bun that they use for the burger. It is toasted just perfectly, and it complements everything in between the buns. The patty is always cooked and seasoned so well. Extremely juicy, and it blends perfectly with the mushrooms, cheese, garlic aioli and the rest of the amazing ingredients. The Kiki's burger is to die for.. . A lot of other people also love the Ronin Burger ($10.00) because it has a fried egg in it, along with caramelized onions, some sort of Japanes cole slaw, and a Yuzu citrus aioli. This is the one that my wife and my cousin always order and they absolutely love it. This one gets a little messy though becauseof the egg, but it's all a part of the experience. . . For side dishes, I always recommend either the Truffle Parmesan Fries ($4.00) or the Sweet Potato Fries ($4.50). Both are served with an aioli dipping sauce. It is a generous portion of fries served in a large cone shaped serving container, and 1 order is more than enough to share among 2-3 people, unless you are a beast when it comes to fries, and can finish the entire order by yourself!. . I don't really have any complaints about Bachi Burger, other than the fact that the wait can be a little long, but when it's worth the wait, it doesn't matter how long the wait is! I've waited an hour before, and it made us savor the meal that much more! The only other thing that I wouldn't recommend are the boba drinks that they serve. Just wait to get a real boba drink from Chinatown after you have finished your burger. I wasn't too thrilled about the taro boba I tried once, so I never ordered it again. Other than that, everything else is flawless. . . We can't wait to get back to Vegas so that we can visit one of the two Bachi Burger locations. I don't rate very many places 5-star at all (check out my reviews), so when I give something a 5-star rating, I am not joking around. Haven't found a burger place here in the Bay Area that comes remotely close to the quality and taste that I miss from Bachi Burger!!
Possibly the best burger I've ever had and definitely the best chili cheese fries I've ever had. Got the Miso Burger and Oxtail chili cheese fries. Both are phenomenal. Beer prices are decent too. Eat here an you'll be thankful you did.
Have been hearing good things about this place so naturally I had to try it! However sometimes we don't get around to much eating in Vegas ha.. On a recent trip we decided to do take out so we wouldn't waste any time! My gf and I split the Spicy Miso and Miyagi-San burgers. SO BOMB omggg. I can't remember exactly what's in both so look it up! I def liked the Miyagi-San burger better but both were good! A couple gf's got the Oxtail Fries.. also to die for! Chili and fried egg ahhh *salivates*.. . They made our order quick too and there were 7 different phone orders! They didn't seem irritated bc man I would be lol. They have a bar inside. I wouldn't mind actually sitting down to eat there one day. Looks like they may happy hour too. Check it out! Two locations for your convenience ;)
I was pleasantly surprised by the food here.  Asian inspired burgers doesn't appeal to me(and I'm Asian).  When I want a burger, I want a burger with ketchup, mayo, mustard, tomatoes, onion, lettuce, and maybe an avocado.  But this place was nice. although I won't be getting any hankerings for the burgers here(personal preference) there is nothing bad about the food here. Not over salted or over seasoned the flavors are mellow and easy.  It's clean, staff is friendly, food is fresh, and they are creative.
