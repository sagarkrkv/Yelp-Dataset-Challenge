A trysting place, Tryst! For your information, the vocabulary means a private, romantic rendezvous between lovers. This term perfectly describes the venue. . . Eclectic venue with the rocky waterfall! The lighting to the waterfall were very celestial and richly colorful discharging a calming atmosphere. Not a bad club at all, but the venue itself is very romantic and magnificent. Their drinks are high-priced but strong! I didn't spend much time here because we were just browsing out this club. . . Nonetheless, it's a nice, bijou club and I wouldn't mind coming back here if there is nowhere to go.
Free nightclub plus! I came to Tryst before they moved it 5 years ago and had a great time then, they really changed it up and for the better! Had a great easy experience. The moment we got there: very organized, other clubs just let a crowd build up, even for guest list. My party was a half hour into guest list entry time and we waited 2 minutes, very smooth walk through. The ladies got 2 free drink tickets. We were helped by Katelyn, this lady hooked it up! Our free drinks were really strong that by the time we opened a tab we were buzzed (arrived there sober), so we actually saved money. Haha! Great experience, great atmosphere, saved money!
Very nice little club. I came here for a evening reception, and the whole club was booked. I was told this place is very similar to XS in style. They had dancers dancing on the platforms, and there's an outdoor area with a water fall. Really nice view. They also had couches all around to sit on, which I assume are for people who book tables on regular nights.
Definitely had a fun "tryst" with friends for a bachelorette party here at Tryst! Since we went out on a Thursday night (XS was closed), Tryst made a worthy backup. I was able to get onto a promoter's list beforehand so we did not have to rush through our dinner at La Cave to make it into the club. . . The bouncers kept everything organized by keeping people in a single-file line and multiple staff members moved down the line to check people in. As soon as I told them my promoter's name, I was able to get drink tickets for my entire party and we moved to the front and into the club (gotta admit, that felt a little A-list). We arrived at 11pm and it was still a little slow, but everything picked up around midnight. For the first half hour or so, we were able to explore the club. It's a bit smaller (more table space compared to dance area) but we really enjoyed the patio outside with a sweet view of the huge waterfall in the middle of the room. . . The music was good mix--a bit of hip hop, Top 40, and some EDM made dancing fun. Since we dressed up my friend in her bachelorette tiara and sash, we were able to get many people to dance with her and buy her drinks. ;) The bar is fully stashed and we redeemed our drink tickets for any combo of well drinks or champagne. The drinks were delicious and strong! I had a Jameson & ginger ale and a Sex on the Beach which kept me warm and fuzzy for most of the night (although I had to help my bachelorette friend drink some of her cocktails too...). . Bathrooms were consistently clean and I noticed there was always a staff member on hand to give out paper towels and and keep the area neat. For girls, there are many floor length mirrors around if you need to check your outfits or do any touch-ups. There is also a a sizable collection of soaps, lotions, hair spray etc. along the counter to keep you looking andsmelling fresh all night long.. . I believe Tryst matches the classiness of The Wynn and would highly recommend this club for any bachelorette or birthday debauchery in Sin City.
great atmosphere and set up.. been here once. was dope but come back couple hears later last night and first off guest list ends at 1230 so we r near the front and they say its closed all of a sudden so..so much for a list. so I was ready to pay so I'm close to the entry I ask a bouncer what's the cover? 30 guys 20 girl..OK cool. get to the entry and she says hello guys 100$ guys 20$ ladies.. said excuse me? she said 100$ guys 10 min ago ur bouncer said 30 and he's ur employee.. and she didn't want to hear it. so waited an hour to find out no more free entry no more reg price.. now making up prices. crazy!!
