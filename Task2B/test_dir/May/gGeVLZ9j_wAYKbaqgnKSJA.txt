Ok here we go.... Things to consider on this review:. This is a restaurant that claims to be one of the finest Asian Fusion bistro in the US so I should be rated accordingly since they are charging you accordingly.. Looks: the place is beautiful, ambiance is perfect, they get a 10 here. Service: started good, I was greeted and assigned a table right away, restaurant was near full, once I sat it took 15 min for my waiter just to show and every time I wanted a drink I had to wait much lore than usual just for him to get my order, once ordered the drink came fast, so it was my waiter the cause of the delay.. Food: I started with a Crispy tuna roll, it was ok, fresh good flavor but too simple, I've had much better tuna rolls in Fort Worth. Then no had the ginger salmon, first I expected wild salmon not farm raised, it was well cooked though it came in pieces, one large a a couple around, not like broken but as if I got the bottom of the pile, again I am rating this restaurant accordingly to what they claim to be.. And charge. Flavor was good, i love ginger, but it was too intense, not even half through i couldn't finish it, it was too much ginger and garlic.. Dessert was vanilla ice cream with apples, the apple part was old and hard to chew, the I cream was perfection.. Drinks: i ordered a beer, I was surprised they brought me the beer in a aluminum bottle and not even offered a chilled glass, made me feel like a red neck . Would I return ?? NO specially with all the options in Vegas.. Hope this is useful !!
This review comes after my 3rd trip to Tao in the last year while visiting Vegas on various occasions.. . I made my reservations on Open Table each time.  No issues, and the restaurant called to confirm on the morning of...unusual for an Open Table reservation in my experience, but not out-of-line in my opinion.  We have never waited for our table...always when we have arrived we are immediately taken back.. . Food, and drinks each visit have been exceptional.  My husband has had the Hot and Sour soup with Shrimp Toast, Jasmine Rice, and the Chilean Sea Bass.  He LOVED them all.  I have tried the Orange Chicken (before I was GF), the Jasmine Rice, the Pad Thai rice noodles with chicken, and the Satay of Chicken with Peanut Sauce.  If I could get this food from home, I would be eating here once a week...without a doubt!  . . We have had great service on each trip with an offer of a stamp to enter the club as a VIP after it opened for the night (bypassing the line, and the cover).  The Club is a different review, but also a definite must-see at least once while in Vegas.. . HINT:  To address the "which is which" that people seem to have trouble with at the bathrooms entry... there is a statue outside each door.  One has boobs, and one has a penis.  This seems pretty self-explanatory to me, and I figured it out for myself on my first visit, after a few drinks.  Seems like it shouldnt be such a big question?
Outstanding food quality and customer service by the waiter.
Went to Tao for dinner and then when there upstairs opened into a night club later on... We were on vacation for my fiancees 30th bday. Food was delish! Loved the sushi. Got the lychee martini--- amazing, not too sweet but had a real nice kick to it. The ambiance was everything!
we went late so we could get into the club for free. i like the restaurant better than the club. but it was loud and busy. definitely loud on a weekend night. our server was not very attentive but it was very busy. the food was great. my fish just fell apart in my mouth and my buddy loved her food too. we had a great time! you are close to the other diners so... never mind! talk scandalous. what happens in vegas...
Not often do I give 5 stars, but the food, fun and service was exceptional. I came here because Kim K had her birthday party here and couldn't have been more happy! Shanna provide excellent service to my party of 7 and we had an amazing dinner. We dined at 6pm, so there was not too long of a wait and the host even chatted with us while we did. This customer service from host to waitresses will definitely have me bring back my service here! Also, they do professional cakes right after your dinner!
Loved the decor, the drinks, beautiful people, good music... wonderful experience all around
I stopped in here on a whim after being unable to find my original destination. . I give the drinks a 4, very good, but not the best. . I give the food a 2. It was edible but my pad that tasted like watered noodles. . I give the atmosphere a 3. Had pretty cool decor, but was really loud and unpleasant for me. Couldn't really carry on a conversation. . The fortune cookie was tasty but the fortunes are terrible attempts at dirty humor. . I give the service a 3. My boyfriend had a soar wrist and wanted a fork. 5 minutes later he gave up and ate with a spoon. Eventually he did get his fork. I pretty much sat drink - less for the 2nd half of my meal. But I know the staff has a lot to do here so I'll do my best not to be a bitch. . I would give this place a 3, but after 2 drinks and 2 entrees I ended up paying 100 dollars. I have to say being completely overpriced has costed a star in my review.
Oh, TAO - I so badly wanted to give you 5 stars, but your over-hyped restaurant had some sever issues we need to address. 3 out of 5 stars for delicious food but terrible customer service. Word to the wise: TAO = a place where the customer is always wrong.. . Here's the skinny: we dined 11 deep Saturday evening while in town celebrating my 32nd birthday. It's Memorial Day weekend and expected to be a madhouse in Vegas, so I made every precaution to secure reservations, be on time for said reservations and ensure my entire party was on time with me. I may not be Kim Kardashian, but perhaps the manager failed to note that my reservation was made by someone who works directly with them and asked for my party to be taken care of. I'm also assuming they didn't know that I am a celebrity publicist in LA and have sent numerous clients to spend thousands of dollars at their establishment. Maybe if this was noted my party would have received better service. . . Food: my boyfriend and I split the chicken dumplings, the spicy yellowtail sushi roll and the chicken pad thai. More than enough food! The pad thai seemed to be in a never-ending bowl! It alone would have fed the 2 of us easily. The dumplings were the best choice out of our order. Fresh, steamed and flavorful. I only wish there were more in anorder! The roll was good, but nothing special. My friend had the BBQ pork and it was phenomenal. I'd look into that if BBQ meats are your thing. The pad thai was pretty standard. It was also good but nothing to write home about. Nonetheless, I was pleased with the overall good experience. The crowning glory was the giant fortune cookie that was sent out for my birthday (it is filled with both vanilla and chocolate cream - oh hey ying yang!) - which was the only good move by the restaurant the entire meal.. . The service: this is where things get rough. We sat down for our 8:30pm reservation around 8:45pm. We didn't mind the 15 minute wait. We're a large party and it's Saturday night - reservations can take some time. I get it. We sat down and didn't see a waitress for nearly 20 minutes. When she finally came by the table she took our drink order and bounced for another 20 minutes or so. My friend asked for an iced tea that 40 minutes later had never made it's way to the table. When we asked about it, the waitress took another 15 minutes to bring it claiming that they had to "brew a new pot". Ok. Then when we were an hour and a half into our dinner order waiting for more beverages the waitress was M.I.A. We finally called over the manager and asked if we could please get some drinks (one of which had already been ordered and never brought to the table). His response was "what? Are you trying to get something free out of this?". I'm sorry? No. We are trying to get our drinks and spend more money in your establishment. Wow. The next epic failure of this restaurant/nightclub comes from the security guard/staff. My boyfriend got up from the table to take a work related call. It was noisy inside so he stepped outside to take it. When he came back in a security guard grabbed him by his shirt and said "where do you think you're going?! Get in line!" To which my boyfriend responded - "I've been sitting with a table of 11 for nearly 2 hours. I just stepped outside to take a call." The guard then responded "yeah right" and grabbed him by his shirt collar. When he turned around to radio someone my boyfriend just yanked himself free and walked inside. The final straw was when the waitress asked if we'd like to divide the tab. We said yes and tried to be fair by making a few groups so as not to create 11 separate checks for her. Tik-tok - 1 hour later (literally) she plopped down the checks with a look of irritation and left. . . Total time in restaurant (due to slow service) - 3.5 hours!! It was nearly midnight when we finally left!. . The club was hopping but we were not interested in that. We just wanted a nice dinner in what seemed to be only a mildly busy restaurant. A party of 11 would have left a much bigger tip had the service been respectable. I get that everyone wants to dine here, but that doesn't mean you have to stop creating a great customer experience for those choosing your restaurant. There are MANY other options.
After eating here a couple time this last experience was lack luster. The beef tarter rolls were so disgusting we didn't even eat more than 2 bites. It was slightly warm, mushy, and the texture made my skin crawl. The signature sea bass is why I usually like coming to eat here and it's been always great in the past but the combination duck fried rice was hard and seemed like it had been sitting out. The fried whole fish was pretty good, I ate everything from the tail to the eyeball and was pretty pleased with it. The duck rolls were bland and our lobster rolls were tasteless and chewy which wasn't good at all. During this last dinner at Tao we ordered $240.00 worth of food between the 2 of us and was only happy with the snapper, miso soup and sea bass. The appetizers were all a disappointment and even our 4 drinks weren't made to our liking. .  Although I've had a good experience at Tao before, this last one wasn't good at all. Not sure if we will return again but who knows what will happen while in Vegas right?
I wish I had gone to PF Chang instead (for an Asian, that's already a big compromise). . The interior design was cool, hmmm, I think that's the only I appreciated while dining there. The food? Hmmmm, I have to be picky when it comes to Asian food, especially Asian Fusion. But this is beyond my tolerance: I never had such overpriced and terrible Asian/American in my whole life.. . My bf ordered Kung Pao chicken and I ordered Salmon sashimi special...When the waiter brought them over, we were like....THAT'S ALL??? Salmon Sashimi($16): It's literally four slices of Salmon with some guacamole underneath. Kung Pao Chicken ($29): it's a small bowl of rice, with some swee. t n sour chicken around it, and some chopped onions and bell pepper. YUP, THAT'S ALL.. . UM, THAT'S ALL. WE WERE SPEECHLESS.
Pretty much all you need to do as a white person to determine if an Asian or Asian fusion type restaurant is worthwhile is to simply glance around the room at your fellow restaurant goers. Are they mostly Asian? If so, the food will be delicious at an appropriate dollar-per-dollar rate. If not, you are either probably getting crappy take out or are about to get food-fleeced.. . Don't get me wrong: the cuisine my fellow Bachelor Party-Goers and I had here, from the admirable sea bass to the wasabi crusted filet mignon was incredibly well-executed and tasty. But while I still enjoyed actually eating the meal in a flawlessly decorated room with its truly hip atmosphere, the ever-present knowledge that I could have had everything we ordered for a fraction of the price at many places in the San Gabriel Valley still sunk the experience.. . That's just me though. I think if you're keen on unloading a boatload of money and you also happen to want Asian food in a super-cool environment, Tao could fit the bill. If you want something that's just as special and more reasonably calibrated, price-wise, there are a ton of other places in LV you might want to visit instead.
