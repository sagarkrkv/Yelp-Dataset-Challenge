Stayed at this hotel for a work trip because of the location and for the price. It looked like a pretty nice place, however, once I checked in and walked up to my room, I realized I was very wrong. Upon pulling down the sheets to jump into bed after a long day, I noticed that there was a giant blood stain all over my sheets. I called down to housekeeping to see if they could change it, and they laughed and said  "oh it's probably just a rust stain, but would have someone come up and look." Even if it was just rust..disgusting. After the woman came in to the room she noticed too that it was indeed not rust. How the person cleaning the room didn't notice this when changing the sheets will forever be a mystery to me. Who knows what else is not actually cleaned in this room. Highly suggest you think about staying somewhere else.
I guess it depends on what your style is...Cancun all inclusive versus Maui pool side. If you like less expensive and can deal with the poor ventilation and average customer service this place is decent. The pool up top was nice and is worth the $20. RESERVE EARLY BECAUSE IT WILL SELL OUT AND YOU WILL BE PISSED THAT YOU didn't. The strip is just so much cleaner and the restaurants are so much better and by the time you take a cab over there you might as well as paid the extra $ to stay at Caesars. I've stayed at Caesars, Palazzo, Venetian and the Wynn. My recommendation is to stay at one of those! Enjoy your vacation.
Golden nugget in down town Las Vegas is amazing hotel casino, nice and clean. Live the shark tank.
I didn't stay here just gambled in the casino. I was very surprised on how nice the staff was. This casino had the nicest cocktail waitress, casino floor supervisor, security guards. It really caught me off guard how friendly everyone was. I liked the free black jack and craps lessons they gave in the morning. The craps table was a lot of fun as the dealers have a lot of personality.
We stayed at The Golden Nugget for three nights two of those did not contain sleep. The first night the fire alarm went off at 3:30am and everyone had to climb down stairs and out of the building to be evacuated because an idiot had access to a fire extinguisher and set it off on a fire alarm. Luckily after twenty or thirty minutes the elevators were reset or many people would have been walking back up the 22 flights of stairs... The  third night  a real jerk two doors down starting kicking or punching the door while yelling, he forgot a key. Security was called and they tried to deal with him but it still took a good thirty minutes for them to get him out of the hall. . Paying for the coffee in the rooms that are no frill to begin with is greed its coffee standard in any hotel I've stayed in. It seems they charge for everything and anything.  I will not stay here again, as much history is here Management has really let this slip away...
We stayed one night in the Carson Tower between a few days on Lake Mead and a few days at the Grand Canyon. I am a fan of the refurbishment they, and really, all of downtown, did. The last time I was in Las Vegas, downtown was dirty, run-down, and it certainly wasn't anyone's idea of a destination. . . The Golden Nugget has managed to maintain it's Old Las Vegas feel with New Las Vegas amenities. The addition of an awe-inspiring amount of Dale Chihuly glass lights and sculptures doesn't hurt. Neither does the pool area with plenty of lounge chairs and a three story water slide through their shark tank (which in and of itself, does nothing for me.). The hotel opens onto Fremont Street and all that it has to offer.. . The rooms were clean, the beds were new, and the shower was hot. Our room was far away from Fremont Street so we traded a view for peace and quiet. (Good trade.). . There is no concierge, so getting any questions answered quickly is impossible. The front desk couldn't even tell us how much the buffet was, so we went elsewhere for dinner. On the other hand, the valet and bell services folks are top-freakin'-notch.. . All in all, a great experience and I would stay here again without hesitation.
If you are a non smoker pass this one by. Smokers everywhere including common areas. My nonsmoking floor has smokers. Upon checking out, the desk clerk double billed for the room, so myself and my friend were charged extra for the crummy experience. Watch your bill!  I won't be back.
My absolute favorite hotel in Vegas. . The restaurants are awesome, the gaming floor is clean and big, the clubs and bars are great.. . I stay in the suites in the Rush Tower -- highly recommended.. . TOP NOTCH PLACE. . The Tank is awesome too.. . You can't go wrong here.  It's better than the Strip
If it weren't for the great location right on Fremont Street we likely would look elsewhere, but for the price you can't beat being this close to the action.. . Room was clean and updated.  Pool was over-crowded.  The walk to the check-in desk then to the tower was longer than desired, especially with a lot of luggage, but there's only so much that can be done.. . Chose not to gamble there.  Too many better places to do that.  And standing in a smoke filled room didn't sound like fun.
We were here for our honeymoon, and I could not be happier about where we chose to stay!  We were in the Rush Tower, all renovated and non-smoking!  Very pretty, clean rooms, I was super impressed.  The pool is awesome.  The casino is HUGE.  I wish we could have stayed much longer.  Can't wait to go back. . . 100 A+++++
First off, it is Vegas, so I realize they charge more for stuff, but let's be reasonable. . The BAD:. - $10 for coffee you brew yourself in your own room. - $13 a day for WiFi (even though there are free ones intercepting theirs). - They do not assist you with public transport. - The pool closes at 5 pm. Seriously. I'm barely drunk by then. I get off of my work schedule and cannot even enjoy a swim.. - One bath robe. The one place I ever wear a robe and we had to share even though we had multiple people in the room.. - No noise control. 6 rooms down a bachelorette party was up all night screaming with an inflatable penis.. - No shuttle service to the airport.. - Broke my finger trying to push the buttons on the remote. . . The GOOD:. - Location. It was right in the heart of downtown next to the RTC stop which takes you everywhere. - Not a very rowdy place.. - Housekeeping was awesome. They were always a few steps away and were very quick and did not ask questions when the BF and I had an unfortunate flooding incident in the bathroom. What happens in Vegas really does stay there.. - The pool when it is open is pretty awesome. They have live sharks. . - The buffet was a decent price and the food was good.
We did not stay here but visited on a trip to Fremont (first time seeing it). I was expecting it to be shabby and old but it looks like there's been some recent upgrades. The place was surprisingly nice! . . We ate in the Cadillac bar and the food was good (terrible service) and then walked around. The pool is amazing! We both wished we'd been there during the day to check it out. The shark tank looks cool too!
Just arrived today and I had high hopes for the GN Rush Tower but the relationship between us turned sour as soon as we tried to check in. Room not ready? Sure we'll wait - and thanks for the offer to call us when it's ready. I love great customer service. Three hours later? No call. Boo. Ok, I let that pass. Checked in our room and it's cool - much more modern than the old tower for sure. Nice. Unfortunately safe was broken when we tried to use it, but it's ok, per front desk, housekeeping and security - maintenance will fix it. Thirty to forty five minutes later? Nada. Okaaaay. Patience. Finally just left the room and cancelled that request. Decided to sit outside at one of the hotel bars to relax and people watch, and I think you can write the rest of this review. Hello, Haydee - we'll complete your first day with us by introducing you to our prize Super rude waitress. And this is coming from an ex bartender and hospitality worker. I know customers can be arse-wholes - I get it! But come on Golden Nugget. Get your shit together. I'm here two more days! . . Will update review after I check out.. . And now...I'm breathing. :)
HAD BED BUGS. The room we stayed in had bed bugs.  We did not realize we had been bitten until we got home.  My friend and I came from 2 different states on 2 different planes.  Now I realize this isn't necessesarily an indication of cleanliness however was NOT impressed with how their "RISK" Dept. handled it.  After they verified the room had "bug activity" in both our beds,  it was insinuated we could have brought them.They claim they only found one bug but that's doubtful as my friend and I both had over 100 bites.  Never once did Richard from the RISK Dept. apologize that this happened but even after I called back twice there was never a return call.  At the very least they could have returned our $ from the stay.  We both put out several hundred $$'s in prevention methods ie; bed bug covers ect..... And we still live with the fear we could have brought them home because it's just been a month.  Avoid this place like the plague!  There are plenty of nicer places to stay in Las Vegas.  Have stayed at the MGM Grand twice and can guarantee this would have been handled differently there as that's a classy place unlike the Nugget.
Still a favorite, but...". . We got a comp upgrade from the Gold to the Rush Tower, as there were no rooms available in the Gold Tower. As I've written before, the Rush Tower needs lighting help. The rooms are too dim even in the daytime, and the light switches are difficult to find because they blend in with the dark decor. I also suggest that persons with flexibility problems in their legs will have difficulty getting in and out of the tub, as it is quite high. As a value, it is still tough to beat the Nugget, but the Gold or Carson Towers are the best bet. . . Room Tip: Request Gold or Carson Tower
AMAZING HOTEL, AMAZING SERVICE, AMAZING FOOD!!! However the pool staff can be a little less lazy and pick up te trash. Its's such a beautiful pool, but I was saddened for how poorly it's cleaned.
I went here as a staycation on New Years of this year. I could have had a free room at the Plaza but I chose here since the room included tickets for the Fremont Street celebration and I've always wanted to stay at what everyone says is the nicest place downtown. I was disappointed. The room was run down. The bed was an adjustsble mattress but it wouldn't flatten all the way, they offered zero discounts to any of their facilities, there was no view and the walls were thin so you could here every word of your neighbors. We had coffee in the room but they did not refill it on the second day. There was a mini fridge which was nice.. . I'll stick with the less expensive more recently renovated properties.
Absolutely the cheapest hotel i have ever stayed at. The rooms have terrible chanels they charge for internet and coffee, they wont even let you in the pool area with a beverage unless it is purchased in the pool area. I actaully bought a drink from  their shop and they still would not let me bring it it even with a reciept.  So dont stay here unless you enjoy pulling out your wallet for every single thing. And being treated like a theif
This is a great hotel, I guess they've been in business that long for being above average. The pool is great, the rooms are nice and it clearly is a great experience every time.
I was really rooting for this hotel. I came up for Memorial Day weekend for Punk Rock Bowling and was expecting much more based on reviews from my friends.. . I originally booked a double and when I checked in I was given a king bed, just one. I was told that they would "graciously let me have a roll away bed for free for this night only". Um, so they were doing me a favor? No shit it should be free, they already messed up my original reservation. After arriving to the king room, there was blood in the bathroom. 2 large splats on the door. I walked downstairs to talk to the manager to just let him know how disappointed I was within the hour I had arrived. He said there was nothing he could do but said he could send someone up to clean the blood. So wait, did they not clean it before? I laughed. He then said he could give me 2 free buffets even tho I was with a group of 4. He said he could move me the following day in the afternoon to which I agreed.. . Following day, we moved to the double. Yay, we're happy. Then we decided to order some grub. If you look at the cover of the room service menu, it clearly says that if there is something you would like that is not on the menu they will do their very best to accommodate your needs. My sister who did not want any red meat, asked if they could make a chicken sandwich for her since it's not on the menu. The lady replied no but they had chicken pasta. Not the same thing at all. My sister then asked, "Well can you just make a chicken breast for me and bring me a bun?" The lady replied no. At that point it seemed like the employees there were intentionally trying to piss people off or just be rude.. . The next day, we ordered another round of food, late night. We called around 4 am to order food and within a second of hanging up we decided we wanted to cancel. We called and asked the lady to please cancel the order and she got very angry with us and told us the order had already been placed and there was nothing she could do and then hung up.. . Overall I was VERY let down. I had high hopes for this hotel. The pool is super cool, although small, it has a cool slide through the shark tank and good drinks, but, I will never reserve a room here again. Ive stayed at the el cortez and the D and the customer service at those hotels far surpassed my expectations. I felt like everyone at the Golden Nugget hated their lives and those of the people staying in their hotel.. . DO NOT STAY HERE! . STAY AWAY!
