Really good bbq! Generous portions and decent prices. Outdoor seating has a nice ambiance. My favorite meats were the baby back ribs and brisket. Seems to be a very popular place as it can get very crowded at times so make sure to make a reservation!
The brisket and Mac and cheese..... YUM! They slow cook the brisket for, I believe, 18 hours and it's so incredibly tender and flavorful. The Mac and cheese also has  quite a few different cheeses... Including velveeta? YES PLEASE.. Personally, I think the cornbread is a little dry and the steak sandwich was just a huge disappointment. I really don't think that one slice of garlic bread and a hunk of steak makes a sandwich. And yes, it's ONE slice of garlic bread... I just don't see that as a sandwich.. The mashed potatoes are great, make sure you get extra gray cause that's the best part.. If you want something as an appetizer, happy hour is from 4-8 and their 50% off... The brisket quesadilla and spinach artichoke queso dip with garlic bread are the best ones on the menu if you ask me.. Give this place a shot, it's got great reviews for a reason. Just don't get the steak sandwich. Hahahah
Best ribs. Pecan coleslaw is to die for as well. This is where I always come if I want unparalleled too quality BBQ. Service and staff are always on point and friendly. I usually go for the platter and get a little of everything.
The brisk was tender and juicy. The cornbread was sweet and the baked potato was cooked perfectly. The service from Sara Hendricks was stellar. By far, the best bbq joint I have been to in a long time.
This place is amazing! I had the best BBQ ever....the ribs were do tender, the brisket melted in my mouth and the Mac n cheese was so good too! Highly recommend this place. The staff were attentive and Donny, the manager,  really cared that we were happy.
First time here it's an awesome place.. food is amazingly good.. service is outstanding.. a must place to eat.
This is without a doubt the best BBQ place I have ever had the pleasure ofvisiting! Lucille's at Tempe Marketplace had been my favorite, but Bobby Q's is even better, and that's saying something! From the time you are seated, the staff are friendly and attentive, even when the restaurant is packed (which is always). The food is to die for, I've tried their ribs, and the pulled pork sandwich, both were superb! The cornbread is amazing, I have to remind myself to save room for the actual meal. Also, at the end of the meal, they bring you freshly-made, warm cinnamon-sugar donut holes to enjoy. It's a bit far out location-wise, especially if you are in the Tempe/Mesa area, but for the best BBQ in Arizona, it's worth the drive!
Bobby Qs. Bobbbbbbbbby Qs. Where do I start. The service, always great. Manager/owner always stops at your table at least once to see how it's going. They don't even give  a second thought to fix the smallest complaint if one exists. The ribs are number one with the smokehouse burger(no salt) a close second. The shoe string fries love accompanying both(again no salt). The corn bread nicely introduces you, then the Q rolls or pizza with brisket fully loaded helps fill a section of your stomach up, and the entree knocks it out. This place has made it so that every other bbq place sucks lol. Go here order the ribs or burger and tell them to hold the salt. Enjoy
I came here with my wife and daughter for Mother's day. I gave my wife the choice of where to go and since she'd seen the interesting looking building countless times and BBQ sounded good, she chose Bobby Q's.. . Upon our arrival without a reservation, we were greeted well by the hostess. I was told the wait was 30 minutes if we wanted to sit inside, or immediate if we were ok on the patio. I found this to be very reasonable considering we didn't have reservations. The weather was good, so we chose the patio.. . We chose their Q Rolls - brisket wrapped in some kind of pastry or roll. Either way it was delicious. The corn bread is amazing!. . Unfortunately the table we sat at only had one set of silverware and a single plate. More plates and silverware were not made available until we asked for them a second time right and right as our main courses were being brought out to us.. . The menu was full of delicious sounding entrees. The best option to my wife and I seemed to be the Whole Hog. We chose brisket, sausage, St. Louis Ribs, and Beef Ribs. All were good with the exception of the sausage. Next time we will opt for the chicken or pork. . . The quantity of food was generous. I had leftovers for lunch the next day and it was quite good reheated as well. . . About midway through our meal the waitress kept coming by an offering us to-go boxes for our leftovers. It was clear we were still eating and this repeated many times. The feeling of "get the hell out of here" was a bit unwelcome. Refills on drinks were also slow to come and required stopping the waitress as she attended other tables. . . I wish the service had been better, but the food was good.
We ordered the myriad of meats platter, and it was so much food we couldn't finish it just the two of us. The flavor of the meat was super delicious so was the barbecue sauce. The beer and cocktail menu was just the right size and had great options. The vibe and ambience is very cool and unique. A little bit of a corporate restaurant feel, but I like all the different size tables and chairs and the lighting was very nice at night.. The service was great and very attentive, they were helpful and polite. She boxer our food, which is always nice, and gave us epically delicious, fresh cinnamon sugar mini donuts at the end. Loved them!
Well I was very excited to try this place based off of reviews and recommendations from friends. All I can say is meh. The food was extremely bland from the cornbread to the cloe slaw and even every meat on the sampler platter everything lacked any kind of flavor. This was extremely suppressing based on all of the raving reviews this place has. Maybe the cooks had an off day. There were two exceptions though the Mac and cheese was hands down the best I have ever had at a BBQ place and the Q rolls were amazing. Service was okay, but there was one thing that really made me uneasy about the place while eating I was watching the bar back cutting limes. First he wasn't wearing any gloves which is gross seeing that those limes go straight into drinks. But he then cut himself on the slicer, I could tell by his expression, he looked down at the cut and then continued to slice more limes. This really disgusted me so I decided to tell a manager. She came right But when I told her what had happened I really felt like she could care less. When we were finished talking she didn't even go remove the limes from the bar but went off to do something else. The food was definitly a dissapointment especially for the $50 price tag but again everyone has an off day, but I definitely won't be back because of what I witnessed and how little was done to fix it.
Love the food. Always fantastic. Service is hit n miss. Met my hubby here 18 years ago, when it was Bobby McGee's so it has a special place in our hearts. Bobby Q's should follow the Ray Kroc motto- put your money on the talent(service).
This place rivals the Memphis rendezvous!!!  Some of the best BBQ, slaw and beans we have ever had!!. Impeccable service from the minute we walked in the door straight through to the end with our very satisfied bellys and tastebuds. And thank you Emmy for the wonderful service!!
Best BBQ in the valley!  Always great service too.
Love this place!! The pulled pork and the brisket are above average. That said, I couldn't find a smoke ring on the brisket. The sweet sauce is very good. The "tangy" is excellent. IMHO, the best sides are the Ranch Beans and the Mac n Cheese.... . . But, the St Louis Ribs are the reason to eat at Bobby-Q!! These baby back ribs are succulent and the meat falls right off the bone. They have the right balance between rub and sauce. The sweet and tangy flavors are what barbecue is supposed to be. I couldn't find the smoke ring under the rub and the heavy sauce. Sauce-less is not an option. Order an extra cup of the tangy sauce.... . The cornbread is moist; a remarkable achievement since most places it's dry as a bone. Bobby-Q's cornbread is excellent and complimentary (Hint, hint to those from Nebraska who believe in charging for dinky little miniature cupcake-sized portions). It's even better with the whipped butter and/or honey on top.... . Our waitress was knowledgeable and her service was top-notch. Our iced tea glasses were NEVER empty and she refilled the corn bread basket TWICE. (Hint, hint Nebraska...). . My only REAL complaint is the handicapped parking situation. The handicapped parking spaces are a couple hundred feet from the front door. I try to park out back near the "Take-Out" door. There are six spaces there. These spaces are approx 75 ft from the dining room doors, but are NOT reserved for the handicapped.
This place rocks! The food really is great and the atmosphere is so fun. We tried the catfish, salmon, roasted chicken and the pulled chicken sandwich. Everything was excellent, maybe the salmon just so-so. The service was OK. Don't order dessert! Free homemade donuts for everyone!! Free cornbread as a starter, too.
While we were in town, I had a hankering for some ribs and thought I'd try this place based on the many positive reviews it garnered.. . Location & Aesthetics - Located just off the I-17 somewhere I believe in the Glendale area of Phoenix.  Lots of available parking in an enclosed private lot. . The place has a rustic look and feel to it.  Very spacious inside, clean including the bathrooms, and well lit.   . . Menu - menus were quite extensive though my wife and I already knew what we wanted as we had a chance to review their menu online before meeting our friends there.  Menu was self-explanatory and easy to find what one needed, not too overwhelming.. . Service - The staff was very friendly.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and was shown a large table to accommodate my wife and I including our friends who had two boys with them.  . I did have a gripe with the table we were seated at as it was a bit wobbly and thankfully my wife noticed too.  It wasn't too bad to shift our meals around so no loss on the ratings.  . Before the meals are brought, they do serve some cornbread with butter in the meantime and though I didn't try it, my wife said it was tasty, delicious, and not too dry or too greasy.. . Food - I ordered the full rack of baby back ribs with vegetables and roasted corn.  Initially when I first saw the full rack of ribs I thought I wouldn't be able to eat it but I surprised myself.  My ribs was well cooked and was practically falling off the bone.  It was soft, tender, and juicy and you could even taste the smokiness to the meat.  The roasted corn was well seasoned, more than enough and came in a bowl.  The roasted vegetables that I ordered was lacking and only consisted of a few vegetable that looked like it was about a tablespoonful.  (-1). My wife ordered the three-meat dish and it was so much that we had to take a bag back to the hotel.  She did comment on how well and delicious it was. . . Rating - 3/5.  The restaurant loses another star/rating based on a small issue.  . After the bills were brought to the table and the waitress ran my credit card, I asked if I can use my Yelp coupon and she stated that I couldn't do so as "the card had already been run" which I don't believe.  I couldn't see why she couldn't cancel it and re-run the card with the coupon. (-1). Despite the 3/5, it's definitely a place I'd like to come back to try some of their pulled pork sandwiches which is what my friends had and looked absolutely delicious!
hmm.. well Bobby Q didn't put a Q on my face ? what? sorry that doesn't make no sense... . . This BBQ joint is way over rated. and not worth the calories nor the money. . . Customer services is awesome, fast and quick. They have a full Bar with awesome beers too. I mean their starters were a lot better than their main dishes. I enjoyed some of the starters i.e. . . Corn bread . Onion block . and . Q-rolls (amazing) . . We also of course ordered their famous pork baby back ribs, a full one with fries. It felt like the ribs were cooked before smoked and just didn't deliver the taste I once had back home (san diego). That is the problem once you taste the best ribs, its hard to accept others. People might find Bobby Q the best ribs and thats fine too, but for me being some what expert rib maker and fan, found it to be just average.
Awesome BBQ, good ambiance and great service. One of the best happy hours also... Love this place.
