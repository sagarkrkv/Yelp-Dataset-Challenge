What could be better in life than a German inspired beer hall smack dab in Vegas?!  Thought of anything, because I couldn't!. . First of all the atmosphere here is amazing.  You are swept into a huge hall adorned with long tables where you are seated among strangers - who you will soon become best friends with!! Clinking your beer filled steins and singling along to the live music.  Simply amazing.. . It doesn't stop there!  The food is phenomenal.  Start off with a homemade pretzel with their various dipping sauces, you'll be glad you did.  It's enough to share - especially if you want room for more beer and your main course.. . I had the Schnitzel Wiener Art, a breaded pork cutlet with cranberry (on the side) and a side dish of bavarian potato salad.  Delicious - portion is huge!!! I ate a good half and enjoyed every last bite.. . This is a must for any Vegas trip!  Order your friend a shot and hilarity will ensue.
I honestly wouldnt even give this place a one star! To check out took over a hour. We booked this place for 17 people for our wedding dinner rehersal. When ordering we told the waitress to put our orders on seperate checks and each couple or person told her that as well when she took their order. When we went to check out she was all flustered and confused. She didnt know who ordered what?! At one point she saidthe more bills you want the longer it will take. Come on, every resturant can seperate their bills, what is the big deal! We asked for the manager several times. But he did nothing to help when he came to our table. Not sure we were really dealing with the manager. The waitress kept lying to the so called manger saying we all said it was okay to do one bill. During all this we kept being ingnored so she could help her new tables. When she needed to finish with us. I finally told my friends and family just leave your cash and lets go. Some people paid and left. Than my husbands parents got their bill for $200 bucks when they only ordered 2 pretzels and a meal. They were trying to bill them for peoples food that already left. So again I told them leave cash for the correct amount and lets leave. My best friend ended up yelling at the so called manager as we left telling him we know the bill is $200 but that is not correct and you need to get it right. Its crappy they disappointed 17 people that will never be back to that place. I also emailed the resturant directly the day after and have not heard anything back. Bad customer service all around from that place.
Was here this weekend and we had a great night until I saw a guy harass a waitress. And the managers didn't seem to care. When the waitress talked to the group, she was loud enough for us to hear, even over the band! That's one hell of a feat, but she played back and forth with them and they were loving it. When she brought the shots she brought them to our table and tried to spank them on our table cause there was a giant pole in the way. One of the guys grabbed her and she smacked his hand away and he got in her face. She tried to make the situation better. Giving them different options on where to get spanked but he was so mad she pushed him off he just screamed in her face. I was in the service industry for four years and how she dealt with those assholes was nothing but professional. She offered to give them to another waitress and whisked away. The other guys in the group giving him shit for ruining their night. The manager came over and I didn't catch everything but I know they were lying. After they left I called the server over, I can't remember her name it was different. I talked to her about it and asked to speak with her manager. A guy manger came over, the woman had already left. He seemed disinterested in what I had to say but he wasn't the manager who took care of it. Beer was delicious but I wouldn't want my gf to work here so I probably won't be coming back.
Mediocre at best and highly overpriced... If it was half the price I would have been satisfied but absolutely nothing was fresh!
Well that certainly was mediocre. Granted, I wasn't there to eat a full meal. Just wanted a beer and a pretzel. The waitress immediately laid into her upsell from the gift shop. 30 seconds to order, 5 minutes of sales pitch. . . She brought out our beers. Hofbrau Hefeweizens. Beer was good but nothing special when you can find good beer pretty much anywhere nowadays. Pretzel was a pretzel. A couple of jarred sauces for dipping. No big whoop. . . After we finished the waitress came back and was really pushing us to buy gift shop merchandise which I declined. She got all butt hurt like I killed her cat. Sorry, not into pressure from a waitress. . . Funny thing is, before we sat down I was looking at the t shirts in the gift shop. I would have probably bought one if the waitress hadn't tried to shove one down my throat. . . Sorry Hofbrau. In a world of tourist traps you win the grand prize.
Food was boring and the quality of Hometown Buffet. The price was ridiculously expensive. I will never come to this restaurant again.
Located within a short distance to the Las Vegas Convention Center. This place is great if you want to hang out with large groups of friends, family or colleagues.. . This themed restaurant is really spectacular. From the outside the facade appears to be multi-storied but inside is a large open hall similar to the Hofbrauhaus in Munich. . . The restaurant offers lively music and entertainment for patrons to order large pints of Hofbrau Munchen hefewiesen and excellent Bavarian foods.. . We got the daily specials  -. . HB Brewmaster Combo . Fried bratwurst schnitzel and a sausage kabob in BBQ onion sauce served with mashed potatoes and cole slaw.. . Pork roast - "King Ludwig". Pork roast topped with onion beer gravy. Served with roasted red potatoes and glazed candy striped beets. . . We ended up getting some shots and received some spanking with the wooden paddle from the lovely fraulein.
Yeaaaa!! This place is truly wierd and fantastic! The sausages were exceptional, the beer was standard and the atmosphere is totally bizarre.. . If you're into the kind of experience where you're not sure whether you're in on the joke or just witness to a very strange happenstance of awkward...this is your place!!
Wow.  I've been coming to this place for over 10 yrs and it is definitely going downhill.. . So, I'm realistic and I know this is Vegas..........granted, the food at Hofbrauhaus has never been German.  The music....not German.  The atmosphere....not even remotely close to a German Festhaus.  What was originally a pretty fun and laid-back beer spot has become another avenue for ridiculous frat parties and bachelorette night-outs.  Besides the fact the music is turned up to 11, for the price of a shot you can get your ass paddled by a "woman" who probably has a Y chromosome in addition to being 7 feet tall.  . . If you want a more authentically German experience, it would be more fun to drive 1200 miles to San Antonio.....yes, San Antonio.........and sample real German fare in Gruene, Pflugerville, Boerne, or Fredricksburg, TX.  That's right....you read that correctly.. . Otherwise, if you prefer to hang out here have fun with Helga the Dominatrix and all the other waitresses that make Betty White look like Kate Upton.. . PS:  One star for playing the National Anthem.
The service was ridiculous, took about 20 min before our server attended us after being seated in what felt to us like a high school cafeteria.  After the food was finally brought out it was cold and didn't taste like eatable.  I would never go back.
It was okay, beer was great though. The food, they clam to be authentic German but the food was kinda authentic. I know some authentic German food takes time to cook so I understand the short cuts. However, I wouldn't mind waiting a little bit longer for a true authentic German dish. This is the reason for three stars. BUT, still go here, it is a lot of fun a good music
Went there to celebrate my nephew's 30th per his request.  The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the food.  Go there for the beer and the entertainment, not the food.... all of us (five) were disappointed... order the shots.
Like the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich - just 1/3 smaller. All German signature dishes and very tasty! With live music and sing along sheets. Imported beer from Munich and the mustards also. Von einem echten Munchner geschrieben.. Anja from Germany is a caring server and although the food took a little bit long it was like home..  Reviewed by a Munich native.
I love the German cuisine. I really wanted to try this place. I never got that far. This place was pretty empty when we got there. We were seated and then...25 minutes later, we left. No waiters with any sense of urgency. Piss poor service and management.
Being of german decent I had to try this place I was a bit skeptical BUT we loved the food the atmosphere the beer and watching everyone get spanked after a shot. Too funny! The beer Garten was awesome we will definitely come back! It was loud but a great place! The seating was cool too! The dessert was amazing!
