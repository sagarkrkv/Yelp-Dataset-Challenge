The food is mediocre and so are the drinks. I don't drink beer but this seemed so popular. Worse then the food & watered down drinks was the horrible horrible service. My food took forever only to find out it had been given accidentally to another table who ordered the same thing. And had recently arrived. It happens,  but my waitress didn't seem apologetic and my food didn't get to me until over an hour after I arrived. I had ordered their garlic cheese bread which was just a thin crust cheese pizza with no pizzaz. . . I really wanted to avoid heading to Yelp about my awful experience as I contacted them directly two weeks ago right after my experience. Needless to say I got no reply, no apology, nada.. . Will never go back.
Four Peaks is an example of a place that DOES live up to the hype surrounding it. I recently visited and ordered their famous chicken roll and beer batter fries. The chicken roll is delish, and the sweet jalapeno sauce that comes with it really completes this dish. It's filling. I could only finish one of the two rolls during my sitting. The fries are awesome too. I ordered them with some sort of smoked chipotle sauce. Good choice, perfect match. Our server was sweet, and I really enjoy the overall atmosphere and vibe. Five stars for Four Peaks.
I am enjoying the special of seafood curry. It is one of my favorite meals to try at different places and I wasn't disappointed. I will definitely be back. Good food and good service.
Very good beer and very good food! Service was great, don't get intimidated by all the people outside, the place is huge on the inside. Seems more like a young, college bar-scene, and we took our parents there and they were glad we went with them or else they wouldn't have gone in. There were vegetarian options. If I'm in Tempe again, I will for sure come back!
I really like the food here! The beer is decent, and the atmosphere is fun. Ambient lighting inside, some seating outside (although I've never eaten outside). Burgers are good, I like the Southwest Burger the best, nice combo of sweet and (somewhat) spicy. For appetizers, don't skip the spanakopita. It's delicious!
Their beer is consistently good. Not great, but I'm never disappointed and it's a good fallback brew co. The appetizers seal the deal for a quick lunch & beer, but the portions are always so large. . Love the environment. The servers can be a bit quick and to the point when it's busy. Might come off as rude sometimes, but they're always helpful and attentive. . Overall, it wouldn't be my first choice but it's always a good choice.
Great place for a weekend night with with guys. It may be fun for a first date, although I think it's too noisy and not private enough for that.

Great food, atmosphere and beer...great prices as well!!! And it's great for big groups!
Best hangout spot around tempe. The beer, food and ambience is great. Try French fries and peach ale beer.
I think that this is basically your typical brewery restaurant ... nothing special that can be raved about. I'm not much into beer but have tried a few from their selection - the Hefeweizen & Sunbru are two I've liked. As far as the food goes, after going there a couple of times now and having tried a burger, some of their appetizers, and the fish & chips, I'd have to stay that if I go back, I'll stick to the fish & chips! I tried the popper burger made which chicken breast & it was extremely huge & messy/hard to eat. The fried onions were really oily & the chicken wasn't grilled well so it ended up being really dry. Their nachos & spinach artichoke dip aren't bad.. . Keep in mind that at this location, parking is a little bit of a pain. They don't have much of a private parking lot so you'll have to find street parking. Plan on taking a little bit of walk to the restaurant because it's almost always ridiculously busy. Additionally, if you're going there as a group, they don't take reservations and require at least half of your party to be there before you can be added to their list to get a table. Even though they're busy, I do have to note that every time I've been there, the service was good and they were accommodating and offered to do separate checks if we wanted.
Awesome little brewpub I went by while in town for work. Was a little surprised (in a good way though) how busy it was for a Monday night, especially considering I didn't get there til nearly 9pm, but was glad it added to the "festive" atmosphere.. . Some very good offerings on tap that they brew and the service from my bartender was very good (even if she did tell me the wrong order to drink my flight of beers). . . Food was pretty tasty as well and didn't take real long before being brought out.
This a must stop for folks when they come to AZ and the phoenix area.. . Awesome beers that are sold everywhere (Kilt lifter, oatmeal stout) and great seasonals (pumpkin porter).. . All food is great, pizzas, fish, sandwiches. I usually get whats on special and it never disappoints (ie: duck confit sandwich). . Place can get crazy since its next to ASU campus but that's part of the fun as well. It is also in an odd location it just kinda pops up on you.. . Parking blows but you get over that after a few beers.
I love their selection of beers, and the artichoke dip is highly recommended. Never really had the opportunity to order an entree, so hard to speak to that. This place is the ultimate hangout at Tempe and is often crowded at all times of the day. Service is always as efficient as it can get in an atmosphere that busy.
I ordered a peach ale and it was gooooood. I should have gotten a growler but I didn't. So I'm regretting my life choices right now. It was a light beer with a sweet subtle flavor of peach. When you get a mouthful, the peach isn't overpowering and the body is light. It is definitely something I would want to drink all the time. Well done, Four Peaks, well done. Claps for you (:. . I also ordered the garden burger. It was topped with pepper jack cheese, spinach, roasted red peppers, and a jalapeno sauce. It was soooooo good too. I shoved everything in my mouth. It fell apart in my hands and the juices were dripping down to my wrist but I didn't care. I was too busy devouring one of the best vegetarian burgers I have ever had.. . If I'm ever in Phoenix again, I will definitely come back here and get a growler.
Went on a Saturday evening and didn't have much of a wait. Sat inside which gave a great behind the scenes look of the brewery. . . Great service by an attentive waitress. Waters were immediately refilled without asking and she checked on us an appropriate number of times to make sure our food was as ordered and to see if we needed more beers. . . I ordered the peach beer which was light and crisp, almost like a cider. Very easy to drink and not super filling. The person I was with got the sampler ($10) which gave about a 4 oz portion of each of the 8 beers. He then ordered a sunbru to go with his meal. . . Food was pretty good as well. I got the chicken beer bread sandwich with a side salad. The beer bread is awesome - soft, chewy, and flavorful. The chicken was juicy and the addition of the artichokes and mozzarella was a yummy combo. However, I was looking forward to the cucumber sauce being like a greek tzatziki but it was pretty bland. The side salad was nice and fresh and the homemade balsamic was delicious!  He got the salmon Blt with beer fries. Fries were crispy but a bit under seasoned. Salmon Blt was great. Flaky salmon and crispy bacon but the star of the sandwich is the multigrain bread. . . I would definitely return here!
The food left much to be desired, particularly the nachos. I've made much better nachos at home. The Reuben was pretty good, to be honest.  This place was packed inside, so the outside seating was a nice reprieve. The beer is great, of course, and it's fun to people watch. Parking is acomplete pain, but this is near ASU after all.  I'll probably be back, but only because my friend likes this place.
Since moving to AZ about 9 months ago, I had their beers on tap at other bars. The RAJ IPA became my go-to, so I was excited to try the restaurant itself. I hadn't been to a Phoenix area brewpub yet, and I couldn't have been more pleased. It was a nice happy hour patio outing. We only wanted to get beers and split appetizers, and the server was accommodating and attentive. I went for the Hop Knot IPA. It's probably the best AZ IPA I've had so far -- and I had been craving a hop head fix -- with light citrus notes and a refreshing bite at the end. My friend went for the Peach Ale, which she claimed to love, and I could see why. I normally can't stand fruit or sweet beers, but I would be happy with a glass. It's not too sweet, and it has *notes* of peach, not a full on peach assault. As for the food, I would love to go back and try an entree. The Thai hummus we split was delicious -- creamy with a few chunks, and the right amount of spice to quench with their well crafted beer.
It was awesome! I see why it had such high reviews. Our waitress Danny was very attentive, knowledgable, and nice. We ordered the peach ale and my fiance ordered the kilt lifter, 8th street, and the raj he liked them all. The food was delicious I highly recommend the shrimp bruschetta and the pub fish and chips. We also got the spicy garlic fries. It was all so delicious. We look forward to going  back.
I came here with a friend for drinks and appetizers before a night out on Mill Ave.  I have to say, for being in such an unusual location, this place is packed!  With a huge outdoor patio and even more seating inside the warehouse style brewery I can't imagine you'd have too much trouble finding a place for a small party to sit on most nights.. . We ordered a pitcher of the Kilt Lifter, which seems to be famous down here in the Valley.  I can see why it won so many awards!  It has a great malty caramel sweetness and is very smooth.  It would be a great pairing with one of their burgers.  I also enjoyed their 8 Street Ale for those interested in a lighter beer.. . We also decided to start with some of their Arizona chicken rolls, as my friend had all kinds of recommendations from friends to try them.  I couldn't believe how big these things were!  They're basically small fried burritos stuffed with chicken, anaheim chiles, and cheese.  The sweet jalapeno dipping sauce it comes with is ridiculously good!  These are best split amongst 4 people.. . We both loved the atmosphere and can see it being a great place to catch a game or simply enjoy some great beers on the patio.  Next time I'd like to do their beer sampler.
Best place for beer, pizza, and wings! Love the atmosphere and the food is delish. Besides pizza and wings everything else I've tried before has always been very good. Oh and the homemade beer is the best part :)
One of the oldest local breweries in AZ, I love this place.  Their food is great, the AZ Chicken Rolls and jalapeno aioli are amazing, the carne adovada is awesome, be sure to get the fried eggs...  And of course, the beer!  Hop Knot will forever be one of my favorites, and the cask-conditioned Hop Knot is probably the best beer I have ever had.  Their oatmeal stout is one of the best stouts around.  Also, SEASONALS!  Seasonals are the best, from Pumpkin Porter to Hop Squatch to Short Hop, I love them all!  Oh, parking's a B*#CH, so stretch your legs and enjoy the walk from the bus stop you'll probably park near.
Loved every beer on the flight! Homemade pretzels w spicy mustard and edemame, yum! Had a great time visiting family and found many places I love in and around Tempe :)
