The Lobster Rolls are the best we have ever had! Lots of chunks of juicy lobster stuffed inside this crispy buttery bread! Waffles fries were amazing as well as the cole slaw! And also the bloody mary was completely flavorful and perfectly spicy!
One of my most favorite places to come in Vegas it's part of the "Aria City center"  Always packed,  always loud  and always plenty of beer to choose from.  I almost always order the prime beef with blue cheese fondue but in a place like this you can't go wrong.
This place was my neighbor when i lived at Veer Towers. I really tried to like this place but after 4 or 5 visits i did not once leave there impressed. It is just another overpriced vegas strip restaurant lacking in impressive food. The wait staff is severely lacking in attentiveness, the food is not bad but i was expecting much better for a high dollar restaurant. It is a nice location and they keep the place very clean which is important to me but i would much rather spend my money somewhere else.
A good place ruined by mediocre service.. . Food - good. Lobster roll was very tasty.  Came here with my wife and two friends and all four of us liked what we ordered. . Price - good. A little expensive by 'normal' standards but definitely reasonable by 'Vegas strip' standard. . Atmosphere/decor - very good. A very good looking place, lively, cozy, with a nice outdoor area.. . Service -  Inadequate. We went in for brunch and the inside space was half full; as most people wanted to sit outside (there was a wait for the patio) on this particular sunny day.. Our waiter was lacking energy and perhaps lacking proper training.. . The food was extremely slow.  I'm not sure whether the kitchen was backed up (doubt it, asthey were only half full) or whether there was a mistake.  . Anyways, as 15 minutes became 25, 35, and finally 45 (I knew for sure since I checked in on social media when we were seated) the waiter never came by to explained to us what was happening.  We even had to flag him to get more water.. . As patience was running thin I finally confronted him about the wait.  He then said 'oh yes, your ticket is next'.  I replied 'can you bring something for us to nibble? I'm really hungry'.  He said 'well, do you want bread?'.  Yes, please, we responded.  He went back but never came back o bring back bread.  No bread, no apology.. . As we were walking out he called me and said the charge didn't go through.  Upon double checking my name and room number I realized at this point we were already 1 hour past my checkout time (we were there 1 hour 45 minutes).. This was finally, the first time he apologized about the wait.. . Las Vegas strip perhaps has the highest concentration of high end restaurant West of Manhattan Island.  Get your act together, customers have plenty of options here.
BEST BLOODY MARY EVER!!!!!  The only reason we came here and we were not disappointed! This one was the Something About Mary. Slider, chicken wing, corn dog bite, cheese etc etc etc! So yummy
Good drink selection and service,  The a prime Rib Chili was good, not great.  If it were chunky style - with someway to tell he meat was actually prime rib, it would have been better.  Campbell's Chunky Steak chili is as good, if not better. Overall, a good experience.
The lobster roll was so yummy I actually finished the whole thing! Had a bite of the sliders my girlfriend ordered and it was also very tasty.  My fiance ordered the prime beef, he didn't enjoy it as much as he has hoped.. It was a little bland and chewy. Standard quality cocktails, nothing to write home about. Overall satisfactory dining experience.
After seeing pictures of the bloody mary "meal" online we made it our goal to visit this establishment.  It is difficult to find if you are coming from the strip.  We searched for 30 minutes.  For those of you looking, the restaurant is right outside Aria going into the city center.  . . My group was participating in an event all day which prevented us from making the trip to the PUB in the morning.  Our goal was the bloody mary and when we arrived there around 11 pm at night...extremely hungry...we were told that the bloody mary's were for brunch only.  I pleaded with them and they kindly made us a round.  They were amazing and we loved them.  . . The rest of the food was good, our waitress was pleasant.  The restaurant had a great atmosphere.  Here is a tip...bring a dollar to the bathroom as there is a bathroom attendant who is quick to squirt soap on your hands when you leave the water closet.  She deserves a tip just for sitting next to the bathroom at the back of the restaurant let alone giving you good smelling soap and a towel.. . We will most certainly return to this restaurant now that we know where it is.
I would go back! The food was good and we were there for happy hour so it was well priced. Also the 7 second beer challenge was fun to watch. We got fish tacos, and sliders and lots of beer!
We had a great time here last Thursday night.  I joked on my facebook page that this place serves "upscale" pub food, which I believe is oxymoron.  Upscale pub food.  Ha.  Anyhow, the mussels appetiser (substituted the spicy tomato sauce with the white clam sauce instead), was fantastic.  The mussels were tender yumminess.  We ordered the recommended Fish and chips and the Lobster rolls.  The fish was crispy and juicy.  The lobster rolls were quite delicious (my only beef was the the lobster was actually the claw meat rather than the tail).  Service was great.  Very friendly.  Atmosphere was fun. . . Oh, we also did the $2 oysters.  First we ordered 3 of each oysters from VA and Baja California.  Then we chased it with another half dozen of the oysters from VA.  Delicious.  Not bad for $2.  Our bill was over $150 tax and tip.  Not cheap; we are in Vegas after all.
We love the relaxed yet energetic atmosphere that Todd English's P.U.B. resonates with us. You feel like you're really in a British pub...huge selections of cold draught beers pair well with Chef Todd English's flavorful takes on some English "classics". British classics such as Bubble and squeak, bangers and mash, pot pies and expertly roasted until tender meats and poultry. . . Our waitress, Diane V., was friendly, effervescent, and attentive. Our water glasses were routinely filled and beer refills were offered. We're "fans" of Chef English's carvery so this time, it was no different than previous visits. Today, I ordered the 8 ounce portion of roasted beef brisket that was so tender that you didn't need a knife to cut it. It was seasoned well and you could taste its "beefiness", in a good way. At my urging, my husband ordered the lobster rolls. Oh boy, these lobster rolls were kicked up a version from those that you'd find at Bar Harbor, Maine! First of all, the rolls are brioche-dough based and secondly, the lobster claw meat is sauteed in browned butter, mixed with seasoned mayonnaise and STUFFED into the rolls. The lobster rolls were complemented with a bag of fresh house made potato chips. . . As we finished our lunches, we promised ourselves that we will return, again, to this restaurant to try other menu items like the Grichebactom and more beer!
We got to the restaurant around 9 pm on a Thursday night (5/8/14) and were seated promptly. There is apparently a different hostess for indoor seating vs outdoor seating. Note that the outdoor eating area is not gated, so every once in awhile, an obnoxious passerby will walk through the dining area.. . FOOD. . Hand chopped ahi tuna burger- served rare and comes with wonton chips and some kind of wasabi or dijon dip. I ordered the avocado on the side since I'm allergic. OMG. This was sooooooooo good. Although they spread the wasabi aioli on a bit unevenly and I teared up on some bites into my burger, it didn't distract me from the amazing taste and texture of this unique burger. There is a layer of black bean puree that brought everything together. The buns were lightly toasted and the arugula marinated to complement everything else.. . Brown butter lobster rolls - came with kettle chips and coleslaw. We split our entrees so I got a whole lobster roll to myself (it comes with three). My goodness, this was one buttery and rich lobster roll. The browned butter is such a genius idea. The lobster pieces were generous and not heavily saturated in mayo. I love how they kept the chunks of lobster big instead of dicing them smaller to make a filler out of mayo. It really kept things fresh and gave me nice chewing action. I tasted the coleslaw and it was pretty good. My mom is not fond of coleslaw, but she polished it off. The chips were just kettle chips, nice crunch, not overly salted.. . SERVICE. . Service was okay. It's what I expected for a bar/pub type restaurant. Nothing great, nothing bad. I don't like servers to check up on us too often; I don't think she checked up on us at all which can be an issue if I needed something, but didn't.  Definitely try out their tuna burger since this type of burger is rarely on the menu at other restaurants.  It's hard to choose between the two entrees we ordered though, so either order both for yourself and take half home or bring someone to share with.  Although there are a lot of homeless people there, so you can always order both for yourself and give the remainder to someone who needs it.
Dear Todd English,. . Your son is gorgeous. You make beautiful babies. He was even more delicious than your delicious French Fries. And they were delicious! However, your sliders are dry as hell . Good wings, good french fries, great service (funny short haired girl was our waitress- you got my back, girl!) Dry ass sliders. But I forgive you. Your son made up for the lack of moisture in my sliders.. . Oliver English, you are one tall drink of water. . . Sincerely,. Silly school girl :). . Me likey. Buh bye.
Great beer & great service! Anthony was by far the best bartender we saw in all of our trip to Vegas. He was attentive, extremely knowledgeable of the beer offerings, & even let us sample some before deciding on our orders. We came back twice more for drinks here due to such great service. . . Also, the 7 second beer challenge adds to a really fun environment & experience.
Just like any pub, it's loud, the best food is fried, and the alcohol is plentiful. . . We visited this pub twice on our visit. The fish n' chips was very tasty! Everything we ordered was pretty good. It's worth a visit if you are looking for pub food in a pub atmosphere.
My favorite place to visit for a pint and appetizers while in Vegas!
Great service. Perfect menu for a pub. Really good beer selection.  Fish and chips; okay but fish was a bit soft to start and complete mush before I was finished. Mushy peas on the other hand were perfect all the way. Others had the burger and wings and both were on the mark.
One Word - Amazing..... . We came here for lunch to start the day off. First thing is that they have an outside seating area which is great for getting some air and catching a few potential rays without being overbearing. Also there is a lot of people traffic which is good for those wanting a more exciting spot to eat. . . Now for the food - I had the fruit waffles and they were outstanding. Absolutely done to perfection, very fresh fruit. The gents I was with had a mix of food and all of them raved about their dishes. Now is this the best place in Vegas to eat? No... but it sure is a great place to have a nice Brunch in Las Vegas.
This is a great spot for happy hour. They have great beer specials and an extensive beer menu that will make any beer lover smile. And if you think you have what it takes to slam beer like a pro you can take the challenge at the bar race and against the mini hour glass to win a free pint! I have actually witnessed a girl who won three in a row!
Mediocre food and service. I probably would have given three or four stars, but the coed restroom (complete with pushy attendant) kills the experience for me.
