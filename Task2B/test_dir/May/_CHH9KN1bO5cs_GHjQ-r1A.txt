SO SAD that this place closed.   . . WAFFLE FRIES were bomb.com and their different kinds of sipping hot chocolate with the rice crispies were truly one of a kind deliciousness in their "hug mugs".   Hot chocolate will never be the same.. . I hope they are opening up another location.
Amazing waffle fries, perfectly crispy and fluffy on the inside. Mozzarella Tomato add avocado Panini, perfect. Chocolate Hazelnut shake with an add shot cake vodka (per server recommendation), delicious!!! Love their theme, presentation, and service.
