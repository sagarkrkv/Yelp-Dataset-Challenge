WAY TOO LOUD. WAY TOO CROWDED. Went on a Monday night in December; only 1 level was open; outside was boring. I will not be returning.
Everything here is a "NO".. NO you may not take the elevator, we'll make you climb 7 flights of stairs in heels! If you're a guy, then NO you may not enter unless you come in with a group of ladies. Exiting Marquee, NO you may not leave the same way you came in.. You must take a longer route to meet your friend, the staircase. Ridiculous stairs to enter the nightclub; 4.5 floors to the hip hop room & 7 floors to the main room. Elevators are supposedly reserved for staff. (*Note: we were VIPs.. Can't imagine how non-VIPs are treated)
Marquee and XS are by far the best nightclubs in Vegas. This was the first nightclub I went to since I turned 21 and every time I go to Vegas (which is often), I always try to go to Marquee. The nightclub itself is just like the Cosmopolitan...beautiful and mesmerizing. Not to mention, it's huge unlike the new clubs like Hakkasan and Light. The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because I'm not overly excited with some of the DJs they have playing there. I am a huge EDM fan and I feel ever since Hakkasan opened, Marquee doesn't have great DJs playing there a lot. Regardless, the other clubs are over hyped and I would recommend this club to any person who goes to Vegas.
If you've been to Encore or Rehab's day party, Marquee's day party is pretty unimpressive.  . . For one, the place is super small.  Even with purchasing a cabana, its pretty cramped for room and we even had people asking us to pay for beach chairs, just so they could have somewhere to sit.  Its a huge pool dead in the middle and a few smaller pools surrounding.  But the biggest thing is almost the DJ booth (how absurd is that).. . Price wise its basically like everything else in Vegas, extremely pricey.  But I think this place is more ideal for bachelorette parties and things of that nature.  For those looking for more fun and more importantly more room, I'd definitely go to Encore and Rehab.
***Review for nightclub***. . I LOVE MARQUEE!. . I LOVE MARQUEE!!. . I LOVE MARQUEE!!!. . Ok I'm done being annoying now. But one more time I LOVE MARQUEE! I've been here about 6 times and each time was a blast!. . I love the fact that there are 3 different levels and each level plays different types of music. Sure there are stairs, but you have two options: use the elevator or walk up/down the stairs slowly while holding on to the railing lol. . . I'm usually downstairs in the Boom Box Room and yes it's small but the music is usually on point! I also like the Main Room and The Library too.. . The pool area is nice especially when you need some fresh air after dancing.  . . Drinks are typical Vegas prices meaning they are overpriced! . . The question isn't IF I will be back it's WHEN will I be back...soon hopefully : )
Whenever I'm in Vegas, I really love to hit up Marquee because of their friendly service, and how organized they are!  I've been to their Daytime Pool Party as well as their Night Scene--both equally awesome!  The environment is very welcoming, cozy, and decor is very me: Modern and the Mgr Terry is just wonderful!  He always takes care of me and my people whenever we're there.  Kudos, Marquee!!
The club is actually pretty small, and like all other vegas clubs, no seating unless you  get bottle service.
After giving this club a terrible (much-deserved) review, I was contacted by Jennifer Kuehne, Guest Relations Rep for Marquee, and she told me to email my complaint to David Long. I emailed David and let him know that my reservation wasn't honored and that they pretty much ruined my 30th birthday celebration. I never heard back from David. I'm sure they really don't care about me and my one bottle reservation but clubs like this don't deserve anyone's business. Clearly they don't value their customers unless they spend excess amounts of money. I have a lot of yuppy friends who I'll definitely tell to stay away from this club. There are plenty of other boojie spots in Vegas for clubbing. The fact that I still haven't got a response from anyone shows me they don't care about customer satisfaction. People who give this club 5 stars are those fist-pumping douche bags and/or gold diggers who love throwing their money away on stupid shit.
Been here for both the dayclub and nightclub, but to break it down & make it simple...The nightclub sucks, but the dayclub rocks!. . Nightclub:. -overly crowded like most have said. -music in hip hop room was good, but you will barely have room to shake your booty. -the guys w/ table service here are too cocky and will try to pull you to their table and dance w/ you. -bar for nightclub sucks. -it's pretty outside the pool area if you wanna get fresh air, or at the balcony. -don't come here for the nightclub if you're claustrophobic. -takes forever to get in. . Dayclub:. -easy/hassle free entrance & when we went, I got access to open bar. -crowd isn't as rowdy as other dayclubs & they're more friendly/chill. -very laid back atmosphere. -bar service is awesome and the drinks were bomb. -gambling tables available to play. -needs more open space for people to lay & tan, or at least bigger pools
First thing you need to know about any place in Vegas on the strip, DRINKS are EXPENSIVE!!!  . . Marquee Day/Night Club and pool was super clean looking.  It's not the biggest pool in town but the cabana's looked nice and even had their own hot tubs right in front.  ANY seating that you might want, you have to pay for.  So you would be looking at about $100-$200 for a typical lounge chair or chaise and everything else is up from there.  The drinks were delicious and the people were really friendly and the service was quick during the daytime (it wasn't very busy though).  There was poker and blackjack going on and the dealers are super nice and want you to win money.  Drinks were $16 a pop but if you gamble they are always free....so gamble!  . . Onto the nightclub.  First order of business is dress code.  ALOT of places we went to require some snappy dressing.  Dress shoes for men and heels for women.  My friend was denied for wearing all black nice Nike's so he had to come back with diff shoes.   When we walked in the dance floor was crazy fun and they always had some stuff dropping from the ceiling with crazy lights, confetti and this AWESOME cool air smoke machine.  It felt amazing after dancing and sweating like crazy!  The best part was when a huge platform dropped from the celing and four GORGEOUS women appeared on it.  They were dressed in crazy sexy space suits with lasers, changed to sexy police officers and so on.  They choreograph danced the hearts out and everyone had their eyes glued to them, it was some serious entertainment.  Drinks flowed pretty quickly too but was definitely pricey, as is everywhere else.  . . I also left my card at the bar that night.  TOP NOTCH service when I called and asked about it.  They have their own lost and found and it took me 2 minutes to reclaim my card by showing ID.  I actually did this twice that weekend and both times they located it in their data base and told me where to go.
The crowd is expected but the workers and and their rudeness is not cool
Where do I start...I must say the vibe was great from the get go because we were on a guest list and celebrating a bday, 1 male/1 female. The bouncers recognized the bday from checking age dates on IDs and congratulated us, as well as overall having a friendly staff leading into the club (arrival time was 10:30). (This itself is a rarity from personal experiences). . We met with our party up in the library, and what a great hideaway that area is to get your night sort of ramped up before the headliner comes on. Our bartender Roland (sp?) was awesome. Friendly, would have a conversation with you, pour some amazing drinks, and mainly just help you keep a good vibe going. The library has it's own pool table and decor that makes you forget for a second that you are in a huge club. I recall like that area.. . As the headliner (Kaskade) started we made our way down to the main floor. Yes, as others say it does get packed like no other. We kept ourselves kind of on the outside and was really there to listen to good music. Kaskade is such a great dj and crowd reader and can keep the energy going past 3am.. . Really had a good time and was fortunate enough to have a superb staff experience. I can't say you will get that often anywhere else, and would bank on that towards the lucky side. Can't wait to come back againsometime.
Indoor/Outdoor club was awesome.  Highly recommend getting a table to avoid the hassle of waiting on line, but expect to wait unless you know someone.. . Waiting on line outside is pretty overwhelming, but don't step on anyone's toes to rub them the wrong way and they will get to you sooner or later.. . Music was good, service is standard for a club and try and get a table outside to get some fresh dessert air!
This club is nice because it is indoor and outdoor. Warning HELLA stairs to get in.. . My friends and I started off on the first level because we had to take a break from all the stairs we climbed just to get into the place. The music was Hip Hop and the bar was easy to access and had decent prices. There is a door that leads to an outside balcony type area that has a great view of the strip and is nice to escape when you're too hot from being inside. The resident DJ Lisa Pittman was playing all the jams we liked and we had fun all because of her! We took a break to see the upper floor which was an open patio area for House music, but we didn't enjoy the music as much as downstairs so we retreated back down. . . One time we were inside and it just began to smell really bad. I'm guess the staff noticed because they burned matches or something to alleviate the smell which I think is great and it worked!. . I would definitely come back here. My only reason for 4 stars is because there was just one club that we went to that was better than this one.
My first Vegas day club experience was pretty awesomeness! This place is pretty nice, clam, loud and definitely worth going back. If you don't want wait a long time to get inside, buy your ticket online and you get in within 10 minutes. The drinks here are pretty pricey, being Vegas! You should definitely drink before heading here. The service at the bar is pretty bad. You can wait up to 10-15 minutes for a drink! The pool is very crowded too. The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 stars is because, I had fun but, not relaxing!. . You can't sit anywhere and lounge at this pool. Unless, you have a cabana reserved. This place doesn't have chairs or sofa to just relax and listen to the DJs! If your planing on doing this, it's not for you. Stay at your hotel pool instead. :)
Over hyped and priced, the main floor played EDM which I love, however the play list lacked energy and did not drive the party.  Entrance and drinks are over priced, even for Vegas. The bouncers antagonize the guests, probably due to the steroid induced testosterone high. Bottom line, go to another club.
Don't go to the marquee unless you have a table. Even though I purchased a ticket to the event, I couldn't enjoy Kaskade's set. It was so packed that the bouncers didn't allow anyone who didn't have a table to stand in the same spot for more than 20 seconds. This is probably because it would be hazardous to a crowd if something were to happen, which is understandable, however, I wish that the club could be designed so that people who are not forking out thousands of dollars for a table can enjoy the DJ. I think if you are willing to spend thousands of dollars on one night at a club it would be a great place to go to. Everyone who had a table seemed to be having the time of their lives. The bathroom had a separate room where there are plenty of mirrors for girls to hog. i didn't like climbing like 6 floors with heels to reach the right one. The elevator guy was way cool though... a free style rapper. . . I understand that Vegas burns holes in everyone's pockets, but I think that it needs to be more accommodating to people who don't have a table.
My favorite club in Vegas. I actually care about the music so I come here for the trance djs. Everywhere else is house music. . . The patio is a nice place to hang out. It's less crowded and since it's Vegas it's not freezing. . . The inside is extremely crowded. I prefer not to be in there. . . There's also a hip hop room and a library. Check it out! . . Go early to avoid lines.
I've come here a few times already to see:. Avicii. Kaskade (1 day, 1 night). Armin Van Buuren. ATB. . Let me tell you the major cons I have about this place. . It is super super packed. It will be extremely hard for you to get around here, with the way this place is laid out. The dance area is in the center, enclosed by this circular area. You cannot even get in there. The security won't let you in at all unless you have a table, or if you bribe them. How lame is that! Depending on the night, the outdoor area can be fully packed as well. . . Now during the day, it can be a bit better. It is not as packed, and you can still get around in the mob even if a good DJ is performing. It's nice because you can chill outside in the sun if you want, or inside if it is too hot. They have couches around the edge of the club where you can chill out, although sometimes the remove them. . . Drinks here are a bit cheaper than other clubs in Vegas. Roughly 15-16 a cocktail, similar to LA clubs. . . Lines are long to get in. I would just buy a presale and go in with barely any wait. I got onto a promoter's guest list, and wasn't even able to get in quickly. I still had to wait in the regular line and pay. Might as well buy a presale.
This club is different depending on what day you come really, (this applies to both the nightclub and dayclub). . dayclub: very chill, nice open area on Fridays a bit more chill, good music, pool is pretty nasty but when is it not at a pool party? good place to come hang out and chill, on Saturdays the partying is bit more "hardcore" and people are dancing a bit more, Friday is a bit more "lounge-ish". . nightclub: 3 floors and an open area, each floor plays different music so you can choose, edm, hiphop, or top40s (not sure about this last one) i enjoy all the floors about the same but I'm a edm fan so that's my favorite. It can get pretty crowded on the edm floor but it's not as bad as Hakkasen or XS since this club is overall larger
I was here yesterday for Porter Robinson's set at the Dayclub, I haven't been to the nightclub. Overall a good venue, but from what I've seen in Vegas this pool area is rather small. Unless you purchase a daybed or cabana you're probably better off checking out a different pool party. I liked the stage setup; I was able to walk right up to the side of the DJ booth without too much trouble even though it was pretty packed. If you're a fan of the DJ it's cool but otherwise I'd check out some other pool parties with more square footage to offer.
The club was amazing. The floor we stayed played the best house music. We were told that the 5th floor played R&B and the 7th floor more of the pool/lounging area. So far the people that worked in the club were very helpful an they really tried to accommodate everybody. They charged men 120 dollars  for the ticket at the door but they can get 75dollar online. For women only 40dollars. Thank God. But still better if you are on the guest list, then you don't need to worry waiting on the long line and paying for the charge. Taking a cab is the best idea after party.all in all, it was a good experience and will come back here next time.
What's a great place to celebrate your birthday and your first time clubbing in vegas? This place! I don't usually go partying, but my brother insisted we should check this place out. Turns out this night happened to be PARTY ROCK MONDAY! Guess what that means? A guest appearance by the man himself "REDFOOO"! They usually have this every month on a monday. So lets put our hands up in the air and start waving them in the air while I start this review.. . We called this place and they told us that the entrance fee was $50 dollars for guys. My brother looked at me and said.... Yo... this is your first time, i'll cover you and happy birthdayyy!. As we were walking towards Cospolitan, this promoter looking person told us he got tickets to the Marquee... all he asked for was a tip. So we were like lets give him $5 and see what he does...  he took our money and gave us the tickets and the night was on!. . The venue was very nice! It had a outside patio and a pool for decoration! There's  a dance floor also, but it got full really quick. I had a nice time and met some nice people. Some of the residents of Las Vegas said that locals get in for free to most clubs in Vegas. Lucky Ducks! This club was a little different from what I'm use to. So you wait in line and then after awhile you are allowed inside a elevator that leads you up to the club. Let the dancing begin! Danced with this on girl, but after awhile she pulled out a cig and started dancing and smoking at the same time.... Reaaaaally.... who does that?.... I guess apparently she does. I guess the no smoking policy doesn't apply here. Total buzz saw... People were looking at her like... what the heck is she doing??? After that I needed a drink! Drinks are expensive here, but that's what is expected when you go to clubs in vegas.. . After awhile, I told myself you can can't let one incident deter you from not having fun. Everything started to pick up again after RedFoo made his entrance.  He did DJ'ing and singing some hits from Party Rock! Night was saved!. . Gosh... Don't know when i'll be back in Vegas, but if I do I'll make another clubbing stop here.
this club has a great line up of djs but the venue is completely off. its not a multi level club so you will have a hard time seeing the dj. There is quite a mixture of a crowd , the employees are extremely ghetto and unprofessional. Although there was a great DJ spinning just like any other club on aFriday night, we were not allowed to go to the dance floor so we went outside and soon we realized that they didn't even have a great surround sound to listen to the music like the other clubs do. stick to XS, Hakassan and Light. . . . a complete disaster, the party at my house was at least entertaining
Dayclub beats nightclub. Suns out guns out bro. The day club has everything you want, beautiful people, cold drinks, a decently clean pool. great music, and none of the bane of night clubs like the crowd, pretentious pricks, and ruined faith in humanity. People are friendly and when the bass drops the pool gets rowdy rowdy. It's the highlight of the Vegas club experience.
This pool/day club is too sick!! Dj booth is hella personal and place has a great set up!! Went for Cedric Gervais for my birthday on March 15th and I'm looking forward to returning EDC weekend!! I used a promoter Brian i found through Instagram (@brian_t_at_marquee_lasvegas) he's legit! I bought my ticket because i know some promoters only get the girls in for free. When i got there i was good on the guestlist as well as my girlfriend, so i just gave my ticket to someone in line and saved them some cash :) He ended up bumping into me in side and bought me a few drinks. What goes around comes around :)
