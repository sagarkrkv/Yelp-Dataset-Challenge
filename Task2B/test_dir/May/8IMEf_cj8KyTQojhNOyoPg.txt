We're here because of a convention. First bad thing is the location. It's far away from everything else that is fun. We walked back from the Strip and it's a full mile of rather dangerous and unpleasant walk on a sidewalk that smells of sewage next to speeding cars and a walking bridge that is befitting of a ghetto.. . The novice black jack dealer was a little cute and mildly entertaining. She almost gave us push on a lost hand which the whole table laughed about.. . In the morning it took 7 minutes for a hostess to acknowledge us in line to be seated at the half empty breakfast restaurant. We weren't allowed to bring coffee from their own restaurant to the pool area. Some guy didn't like us moving poolside chairs into a shade.. . It's not one thing, but a collage of a bunch of wrong things that paints an ugly picture for this resort. We won't be back.
It's been a few years since we've stayed at the Rio.  The MU received an offer for three nights/$375 in slot play so we decided to give it another shot.. . The rooms are called "suites" since they include a sofa, coffee table and a chair.  Our room had seen much better days.  The carpet was frayed, the furniture was saggy, dirty and old, one of the sinks barely drained, there were strange stains on the ceiling and the mini bar fridge wasn't cold.  The view of the strip was fantastic, however.. . We called down to housekeeping to complain about the warm mini bar.  No one ever showed up to fix it.  We requested extra pillows since the ones they provide are more suited for children than adults.  They would only bring us two.. . I've never enjoyed gambling at the Rio.  Fortunately, we spent very little time in their casino and didn't waste our money.  The rooms are in desperate need of renovation or a thorough cleaning.  I did not want to walk on the carpet in bare feet for fear of catching some type of lethal foot fungus.
While I loved the past 3 stays at The Rio, last week was worse than I could have ever expected as.. . We were there 4/23 - 4/27 and I was so disappointed. The bench at the end if the bed was filthy. And shame on me for not getting a picture of it. . . I did get a pic of the sink missing a stopper and I was terrified that my rings would slip down in there.  . . Also, the room door would not automatically close. The second night, security woke us up around 5 am to make sure we were ok cause the door was open. Imagine what could have happened!!!  . . I know it's an older hotel but they seriously need to invest in upkeep!
I was very happy staying here. They took care of every need. The pool was great as well as the service. Skip the buffet, they need one or two more restaurants here and perfecto!
I stayed at the Rio for the first time this past weekend and my boys and I had a great time. .  We went to the pool party and kicked it under the water fountain macking chicks and straight up got rad as fuck for 3 days. .  It was clean. The service was great and the room was impressive. . It was tidy, spacious and the bed was comfortable for the 3 hours total that I slept.. . I would definitely come back to get rad and party like chow again.. Thanks for a great stay Rio.
I have stayed here 3 times now and I love the Rio! My husband and I booked a room for a 5 day stay and we were very happy with our experience. Rooms are spacious, clean, and well furnished. We had a great view of the pool and the strip which made things even better. . . The hotel as a whole is great, the only reason why I feel it is 4 stars and not 5  is because the food selection is very slim. There is only 1 real "fast food" place (BK Bar- which is terrible!) and the Sports Deli is next in line for a quick bite (I only had a pizza slice there- it was okay). Everything else there is a sit down meal or the buffet. I think this hotel would do well with some sort of food court. The best food we had during our stay would definitely have to be Carnival World buffet. . . We will definitely be staying here during our next trip. I love that this hotel is close to the strip but far enough away to where you are away from all the craziness. Shuttle service is great as well- 10am-1am every 30 mins drop off/pick up at Harrah's or Bally's.
The only reason we come here is for the room price -- less than $25/night, including wifi. The rooms are spacious, but the carpet needs to be stretched.  Better, it needs to be replaced.  There are no night lights, so a midnight trip to the bathroom can be tricky.  If you leave the bathroom light on, it shines through the window onto the bed.  The grout on the shower tiles need to be cleaned or replaced because of mold.  The coffee should be free, but it's not.  Rather, it's expensive!  The automatic door from the parking garage into the casino is broken, as it only opens one set of the double doors, making handicap access difficult, if no dangerous.  The bed was comfortable.  The Vietnamese restaurant is good, but expensive -- especially without table service!  Penn and Teller happened to be on vacation when we were there, and I had really wanted to see them.  Generally, we eat and play elsewhere -- and there was no show in the casino, as they used to.
my husband and I stayed at the rio over the past few days and it is one hotel that we will not be returning to, First off we check in and they ask one bed or two I said 1 and when we got there we had 2 beds, whatever. The toliet was acting up the whole time we were there and the shower had no pressure. There was a mini bar there but we didnt realize that once you picked something up you were automatically charged and they provided a keurig machine but did not provide coffee, you had to go down to their convenience store and buy some. My husband tried connecting to wifi on his phone and they wanted to charge 13 dollars to use it. The air conditioner sucked too, I was sweating every night unless i slept at the foot of my bed. I was excited for the pool but when we got there right when it opened the sand on the beach was filthy i was disgusted. We tried the sand pool and it was extremely cold, not enjoyable at all. We tried the "jacuzzi" the 1st was out of order, the 2nd was cold and the third was lukewarm. We tried the fish pool they had it was like a pool you would see at your neighbor's house, nothing special. I was also excited for the buffet  we went right when it opened, some food looked like it was sitting over night. We also took the shuttle to and from harrahs, it was a time sucker, not convenient at all.
Worst hotel I ever stayed at in LV. Not very clean, rooftop music going until 2 or 3 am, got a sewer smell several times, parking garage was filthy, could hear tv, conversations, and other stuff from neighboring rooms. Check in took 45 mins (line got even longer, friends took 1.5 hrs!)... less than half the computer stations had a staff person. Had to pay for wifi (even Motel 6 offers free wifi). Food overly priced and not that good. Slots were extremely tight. Moved to another hotel.
Overall it was OK but really dislike no free coffee in the rooms. I accept paying $5 for a Pepsi from the vending machine but how cheap do you have to be to not have coffee free to your guests in the room. Little thing but with so many choices I will never stay here again.
The Rio is not a bad hotel however, they could definitely use some upgrades. . . My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 days back in March of 2014 for pretty much free since he had racked up $400 worth of points to use for Las Vegas from one of his credit cards. One of those really nice perks. He was able to get this great package deal from a Christmas/Holiday Special Vegas was running back in late 2013. When he called back in February to check on the hotel to see if everything was still good, I believe it was stated to him that the deal could only be used in the month of February. He explained to customer service that he was never told that and booked the room for March. When we arrived to check in, we were told we were upgraded to I believe the Master Queen Suite after realizing there was a mistake on their end and which is how we got the free room upgrade, free internet and $35 room service voucher. GREAT perks! We would have been upgraded to the King Suite but they were all booked. The room had double beds and was huge! We had so much space to lay out our belongings. . . The place was very clean. The room had a TV, area for lounging, a huge vanity mirror, two sinks, spacious bathroom with a tub/shower and granite counter space. Also, there was a large closet, more than enough drawers, small fridge, Keurig and a safe. Everything you need for a hotel stay. We had a FANTASTIC view of The Strip. We could see all of Vegas. Our room was high up and located on the side of the highway. The view itself sold me. At night, it was a site to see.. . We ordered from room service which was very expensive. We shared some fries and chicken strips and had two drinks. It was over $30. Again, because we had so many points stocked up, it was essentially free. Also, we used the $35 room service voucher we were given as an upgrade. When we needed towels, we called down and they were sent up immediately. It was unfortunate we couldn't utilize the pool more but it was OK. The Casino was paying off very well. in total, my BF and I won $1500 our time there. . . Also, they have the Voodoo Lounge on the rooftop. WOW! The view is breathtaking. I was however bothered by the fact that if you wanted to sit on lounge chairs/couches that were by the window, you had to buy a bottle of wine. I think that is was crappy. You already had to pay to get into the club and then you're told if you want to enjoy the view of indoor seating, you had to pay an additional charge. That was crappy but at least the drinks were decent. . . Where there was room for improvement was the carpet. It's old and outdated. Also, the toilets are VERY loud when they flush. I am not sure if this is due to piping or what but it was noisy. . . Overall, I really enjoyed my visit. It could certainly be because we practically stayed there for free but even if we did pay, I cannot say I complained much if at all with the hotel other than the smoke ( which really can't be controlled).
This place is great if you have no problems.  . . problem one, the batter of the door key pad died.  Went abck and forth thinking i was the one that de magnitized the card.  After the fourth trip up and down, stated the i thought it might be the door so was told I would be greated by security.  The security gaurd (wish I remember his name but he is from Hawaii and really a very nice gentelman), meet us at our room.  Used he key and said...yup it is the battery so he called down.  I knew it was the batter being that there were no lights when i put my key card in the slot.  The "lock smith" showed up 25 minutes later.  So me and my friend had a very nice chat with the security gaurd about how he goes and visits home about once a year, blah blah blah, lol.. . the lock smith should have come with the security gaurd...to not have their guest waiting. . problem two, i called for a wake up call at 445 am as might flight was at 7 am (stupid i know, but then again, missed all the security lines).  At 330 my friend came back (his flight was at 2 so he was still rocking the vegas night).  He being drunk, woke me up and thus i called to cancel the wake up call and reset one for 1030.  The operated cursed and said the computer was broken/down and nothing she could do.  I asked they she write it down and that when it was abl eto be done to make ti happen.  she said she "can not promise" that being done.  . . The greatest part of the weekend were the card dealers and pit bosses.  They scrambled to make everything right.  Boun (sorry if i butchered your name) made my trip so much better.  thank you for make me laugh really hard before my flight left.  until next time. this from the guy with one piece of glitter on his face.... . not sure i will ever stay here again but if they make some customer service changes, would really like too.. . oh and $125 per person for a cabana is insane.
DISGUSTING. this hotel is sorry excuse for a good clean time in Vegas. As a Vegas regular I try to change up staying places but my heart stays at the MGM and Mandalay bay but after receiving total rewards discounts for the rio I decided too try it out the newly "remolded" rooms were nothing more then trash it looks like a blind person decorated and the pool was Fing gross hair band aids and sludge can be found in the jacuzzi and middle heated pool  checking out I happened to leave my swimsuit on the bank of the door Handel I called within the hour of leaving it thinking the maid would have turned it in to later find out no such was turned up. This hotel is gross no remolded and obviously they hire thives.
I am really disappointed. My first time starting at the Rio and it is so run down.. . We get to the room and the first thing I notice is duct tape holding the carpet down. So then get comfortable and take my shoes off and the carpet was wet everywhere. I wondered if they just shampooed a crime scene or something.. . The beds are made so badly the sheets do not look pulled straight or tight. The good thing is they are not like sleeping on the floor or a sheet of plywood.
Where do I even begin? For starters, this was my second time in Vegas and after staying at The Palms and having such a great experience, I expected about the same from The Rio. When me and my girlfriend checked in, we were offered an upgrade if we wanted to pay extra so we took it hoping to enhance our experience. When we got up to the room, I could have thought it was a joke. It was one of the ugliest rooms I had ever seen. It did not look like a classy hotel as they make it out to be at all. They told us it had just been renovated, yet the furniture was old, stained, chipped. There was poop on our windows and they were so dirty we could hardly see the view. It was not very clean and it smelled of smoke even though we requested non-smoking. . . After complaining, the only thing they offered us was a DOWNGRADE. How is that any better? After some pushing the subject, they allowed us to switch rooms, but even though this one didn't smell as bad, it was still not very nice or clean. In addition, the shower pressure practically rips your skin off, you can hear the pounding music at night from the club above, the walls are paper thin, they have poor customer service and somewhat rude staff. The maid service was also poor. I left a good tip and all she did was make the bed. Two separate times, she came in before knocking and one of the times I was naked. She proceeded to then walk into the room (after saying hi) an then check something in the mini fridge and then left. I couldn't believe it! And after we complained, the staff just looked at us like we were being divas. The only good thing I can say about this place is the pool is nice and the restaurant, Hash House A Go-Go was great.. . I will be coming back to Vegas, but I would not waste a dime to stay here. Don't expect a nice hotel. Its more like a motel with poor customer service.
I stayed 2 days for a conference.. . Rio isn't horrible, but after staying at hotels on the strip I feel like Rio's heyday was in the 80's. This is what you have to expect from some of the hotels off the strip.. . My room happened to be right above a kitchen on a high floor. I was able to smell food in my room during the night. . . The rooms are spacious. The hotel itself is old-school and is in need of an upgrade.. . I came here on a different conference visit just to eat because a colleague swore by the buffett, but the buffett was just as good as any other casino buffett IMO.. . The other restaurants in the hotel were just okay. There's a burger king available as well if you feel like saving some dough.. . Rio isn't a bad choice if you are getting a REALLY good deal...especially if you are going to spend most of your time outside of the hotel.
With all the new casinos popping up on the strip, not many people want to stay at the older casinos like Stratosphere, Palms, Circus, and Rio. Rio is pretty old & is off the strip, but their suite rooms are a lot cleaner than I expected. For the price you'd pay at Luxor, you can get a way bigger room at Rio w/ a free fridge inside for use! Hooray for no more filling the bathtubs up w/ ice to keep the drinks & alcohol cold lol. Plus the fridge helps when you've got ton of leftover food or need to keep snacks cold.. . The pool area is really nice (there's about 5-6 different pools?), but the jacuzzi is small and is sort of unappealing after seeing it be crowded w/ a bunch of fat hairy men. They've also got a kid pool area w/ beach sand on it (no, sorry it doesn't look as nice as Mandalay Bay w/ their  man made beach wave pool).. . The only con about the rooms here though is that there's a random circular window that shows the head of the person taking a shower. The suites have such a huge amount of space you can easily fit 10 people in it. Sofa is comfy enough to sleep in and the beds weren't too bad either. Their room service and customer service were really top notch for an old casino. If you're too lazy to drive, they have the monorail that takes you back to the strip. Overall not bad if you wanna get away from the crowds on the strip.
Okay, so I got a free room offer as a total rewards member.  So free offer you can't refuse from Las Vegas right.  So here is my review and experience at the Rio:. . Goods:. *  Rooms are very nice and comfortable.. *  Casino has a big variety of gaming options.. *  Very nice spa and the service in the spa is A+. Bads:. *  Maid service ignored my service request when I called for room cleaning at around 3 p.m., came back at 2 a.m. and room was still not cleaned.  Had to wait 45 minutes for them to bring me towels since I was checking out early the next morning. . * Night club located on the top floor of the rooms,  heard the bass late at night from the music. * Pool bass was loud and couldn't enjoy the movie in my room during the day.
So far my experience has been welcoming and my room rocks it's very nice and cleAn and may I add modern ! Love it
I stayed in a suite here. The suite was huge and ran almost the lengthof the building. The one thing I noticed is that the room showed its age. It was a good experience none the less. check out the buffet while you're there. The pool area was pretty tropical and above average!
Best roof top in Vegas!!!. Amazing rooms ,big, cleaning, beautiful view, spacious bathroom and complementary coffee and the.. Superb swimming pool.
Great price for a suite which includes bed and sitting area, a couch and a very large vanity that most ladies will love! The room itself was great! Very spacious. Perhaps the furniture is a little old or scuffed here and there but definitely not a deal breaker.. . My only complaint with the room we had was that the plumbing was very old. When you washed your hands in the bathroom sink, it would make some weird back up noise in the vanity sink outside the bathroom. Again, not really a deal breaker, just annoying. And please management, please update your shower heads!!! They are so dated and old and don't even spray properly. Living with that for 4 nights made me come home and analyze my own shower situation. Hub and I replaced our own shower head the next day.. :  ). . It's not as exciting as the hotels on the strip but it does the job. There are a  few restaurants and a Starbucks even. And the main gift shop seems to be open 24 hours but not positive on that. It's great for your morning Tylenol or to get a quick snack. . . I think I would come back to this hotel. It was a great deal and didn't make me feel dirty.
The Rio is a relatively nice place. It's comfortable, and the property is large with good amenities. Pool area is good. Staff is friendly. Why 3 stars?? Although the property is nice, there are some repair needs that seem to be blatantly avoided. Management should step up and put in some repairs and updates to make this place competitive with the newer hotels.
This review is specifically for the graveyard craps dealer team:  Joe C, Jeff K, Jon H., Hee Chi, and Mike Angelo.  We are regular craps players, living locally in Henderson.  We have played almost everywhere.  This particular team of dealers was by far the best group we have ever come across.  They work together seamlessly efficient, while maintaining an approachable, yet professional atmosphere.  They were welcoming and pleasant.  The thing that stood out the most for us was their  comradery and supportive team dynamic.  This, we have seen nowhere else.  Thank you, guys for a great experience. We will be back.
