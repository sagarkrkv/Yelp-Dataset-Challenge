Super hot fire Hangover Omelet w/ Avocado! Eggs were fluffy (probably 4 eggs) enough mushrooms, onions, and the cheese was on point! . . My friend ordered chicken and waffles and they were a win! . . Frozen hot chocolate for table of 5 burned our tongues with so much flavor. It was the large size. Must order whip cream is right too. . . Other friend enjoyed the white omelet and he scrapped the plate.. . Judy Booty was our waitress she was a sweet heart!
Frozen hot chocolate=yummy, worth the $11, not even close.. . Ordered the veggie burger. Reading it on the menu it sounded delish. When it was served= there was chicken pieces in the sandwich! what the heck?! Manager apologized but there was no explanation as to how chicken and veggie burger could be served on one plate?!. . Told it was a 15-20 minute wait=reality it was closer to 45 minutes. Awful service. One server quit that day and just stormed off. As a customer I should have done the same.. . Famous for being recognized in the movie but other than that, not worth the hype. At All!
Over priced and over hyped. You'd be better off going to a high end fancy restaurant if you want to spend that much money on ice cream and desserts. At least you know you're paying for the quality.
The food is good... I knew that from previous experience. But I'm now waiting almost an hour and a half empty restaurant for food. This is crazy - what kind of service is this? How long does it take to cook a few burgers?
Very good place for breakfast. Had the balsamic strawberry waffle and split it. Awesome flavors for all the food my group got. I would recommend this place for breakfast people!
Well, everyone said you have to go to Serendipity 3 when you go to Vegas. So I went. The menu didn't exactly strike my fancy, so my friend and I decided to get the lucky 7. It's 3 eggs (nice and fluffy ), 3 pancakes( nothing fancy), 2 huge sausage links (very tasty). We split it, and still couldn't finish it. Customer service was very nice.  The waitress even bought me a lovely chocolate covered oreo mouse dessert for my birthday on the house.  I'm giving 3 stars because the restsurant was nice. But not exactly 4 stars material.
The only thing I've tried here are the frozen hot chocolate (signature) and the carrot cake dessert, both of which were delicious. Expensive, HUGE portions, but yums all the same. Decor is hot pink and the like. Quite memorable!
3 words: Frozen Hot Chocolate. SO DELICIOUS! I didn't give 5 stars because the wait was over 45 minutes- BUT they have a to-go order window and you can get a lot of things that they serve in the restaurant to go.
I'm definitely a fan! It is always crowded  here, so I do recommend making reservations, if you do plan on dropping in spontaneously, expect to have AT LEAST a 30 minute wait. The atmosphere is loud and upbeat on the inside, but out on the patio things do sort of calm down (as long as they have the misters and fans/heaters on) As far as the food goes, I've pretty much had everything on their menu by now, everything is delicious! Of course, like any restaurant on the strip it is pricy, so if you're planning to stop by on a budget, make sure to put your pretty penny towards dessert! They are expensive, but the portions are huge, I'd say able to feed 3-4 people.
Good dessert, but not worth the hype or the price. Plus this was the 3rd time we had tried to go, but got held up the other two due to crowds and horrible hosts at the door...this time we were finally able to get in. Overall not a fan.
Went with a group of 7. Food was overpriced for what it was and our service was not good.
Finally had the opportunity to try the famous Frrrozen hot chocolate.  Long wait for the restaurant, but thanks to a tip from fellow Yelpers, I just ordered my drink from the To Go window.  Took about 5 minutes before I was able to enjoy this chocolatey, creamy goodness. . . It's pretty much an icy chocolate milk drink with whipped cream on top - or with mini chocolate chips sprinkled on top.  . . A wonderful treat on a hot Vegas day.  Definitely worth a try.  $11 worth...?  Dunno.  I'm glad i tried it, don't know if I'd go back for another one honestly, but it's worth trying.
It is not all that. We didn't enjoy their food hence the didn't care to order desserts. I do not mind paying the price if its awesome! Alarm went on while we're eating and no one came to apologize for the inconvenience. Ambience was better than the servers or food. . . We will not be back there. I would however try the New York City's Serendipity.
Love this place and I'm and old guy. My daughter took me here great food bizarre scene (crazy) fun and I'm coming back
Let me start off my review by saying this: the desert here is amazing!!!  Order desert!  We got the banana split and loved it!. . I'll give the place 3 stars for their wonderful desert.  Service and table quality was a bit average (ours was wobbly).  The food was decent, but a little pricey.. . However, you must try their desert!  Anything on the desert menu will do.
Mmmmmmmmmm  Mmmmmmmmmm delicious!  Do I really need to say more?  It's ice cream and other sweet treats.  They are GIANT - learn from my mistake and share!
I have to wonder who are these sheeple who think that garbage, as long as it's famous garbage, is actually good food.  Sure, Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate was all over the Food Network and perky little Rachel Ray slathered it all over her body or something like that.  But let's get down to brass tacks: it's CRAP! absolutely friggin' CRAP!!  For $11.89 (with tax) you get Swiss Miss, ice, and milk thrown into a blender with a little whipped cream on top.  If you think that Swiss Miss, ice, and milk could possibly amount to anything worth that kind of money, not to mention the sugar-packed empty calories, then you're a sheep, an idiot lobotomized sheep who oohs and aahs over anything featured on the Food Network.  Enjoy your 12 bucks of crap.
Super pricey. But that's the Vegas Strip for ya. Mother's Day brunch. Glad they took our rsvp. Decent corned beef hash & potatoes but nothing to write home about. Hubby liked his huevos rancheros. My guess: The giant desserts w/a ton of straws for all to share are why people come.
I gave it two stars because of the waitstaff and food, otherwise it would have been one star or less. . . I went in with a large wedding party (24) and we were treated like crap by the hostesses and the manager. We were split up at three different tables and separated from each other. Then we were lied to about why we could not sit at the multiple open tables next to one another. They did not care to try and accommodate us; even with us making reservations days prior. . . The manager was obviously on an unnecessary power trip and she did not need to display the attitude she did. A separate manager, Sam, was very apologetic and wanted to make it right when I spoke with him later. However, the damage had been done and it left too bad of taste in all of our mouths. None of us will return solely due to the way we were treated by the frontline staff. . . With that being said, the waiter was amazing and it was obvious he understood our frustration. He went above and beyond helpful to try and make us feel welcome. In addition, the food was very good.
A girl friend and I stopped in on Saturday afternoon between bachelorette parties and shared a fried oreo sundae. It was so good; we left in a sugar coma. haha. We'll definitely have to come back with our men sometime!
Went here in fall of 2013 and the French toast log I got was so phenomenal that when I came back to Vegas this past weekend serendipity was the first place I came to and I got the exact same thing.  My friends got other various brunch items which all looked good but I didn't want to try them because I had my hands full with my own plate.  The frozen hot chocolate is delicious too.  I'll admit, the service is not that great.  Especially this past May visit when my plate was delivered 20 minutes after everyone else at my table got theirs.  They were done eating by the time I finally got mine.   Somebody majorly screwed up there.   There were no problems the first time I went though and the food was great both times.  I will go one more time, when I bring my daughter to Vegas, just because I talked this place up so much the first time I went and now she wants to try it. But probably not again after that.
the frozen hot chocolate is worth trying.
The best part of this meal was the frozen hot chocolate (which was comp'd by Caesars).  The food was so so at best.  My sliders were burnt, which I send back and did not want a replacement since I don't have some 3 second rule to happen with the replacement.  The tomato soup was delicious, but probably all canned.
The oreo frozen hot chocolate and the cookie sundae were both aaaaamaaaazingggg! I literally cannot wait for my next Vegas trip just to eat here again. It was super busy, but the service was great- attentive and fast. We left with a massive brain freeze/sugar rush combo, so you know it was amazing :) Was also happy to see more adults than kids here, as we were not sure if (in our 20's) we would be the oldest people in the room.
This is somewhere you should pop into once just to say that you've been there. . The Frozen Hot Chocolate is fairly tasty but way overpriced. I would suggest sharing it, just so you can get a taste and say that you've tried it.. I do love the atmosphere, but the service is mediocre. . Check it out, but don't expect anything amazing.
This place is delicious.... yet you need to be off weight watchers or eat zero points before or after going here for the day!  The food, from the appetizers, to entrees, and especially to desserts is super yummy and fun! Breakfast here is excellent!. Their sundaes are ridiculous!. The bad side: service could be improved and it is over priced. Great for kids!
Waited 15 mins only to be seated outdoor when we specifically requested indoor.  Looking around in the restaurant there were plenty of empty seats. Not sure who or what they were expecting... We came for some dessert but our stomachs turned when our desserts arrived - massive portions and sloppy presentation.  The taste and quality of food was mediocre.  They get away with overcharging on this garbage made from cheap ingredients.  As well, the interior decorating and ambience was a disappointment too, certainly far from any "Vegas" standard.  . . You'd be much happier and satisfied by going to Dairy Queen for dessert.
Went for breakfast very delicious burger unlucky with the server
Today was a bloody mary sort of day for me.  My husband and I stopped off at a high end restaurant first where I ordered my usual bloody mary with extra olives.  The bartender gave me an average drink with three little anorexic olives on a pick.  Later in the day it was hot and we wanted to stop for cocktails again.  We sort of stumbled upon Serendipity.   The a/c was going and the Dodgers game was on TV so we chose to sit at the bar.  Jesse was our bartender and I placed my usual order.  His Bloody Mary was top notch!  Full of flavor, fresh delicious and he by the way heard my request for extra olives.  I got six firm extra large olives (2 picks of 3 BIG olives!)!!!!!  I asked how did he get so much flavor in there.   He said their vodka is infused with peppers, onions & celery and pointed to the large decanter with fresh veggies floating inside. Delish!  Great job Jesse, we will be back!!!!
Service getting worse and worse each time we come here. The food has always brought us back but that probably will not hold true much longer. Too much of a wait to even be acknowledged by a server.
Serendipity has a great location to people and city watch while you munch on their patio. Their frozen hot chocolates and desserts are great & guaranteed to put you into a sugar rush. As for the rest of the menu that aren't desserts, I find them completely mediocre & not very flavorful. The chilli is good (can't mess that up), the alfredo lacks sauce & thickness, the abc burger is okay with unimpressive fries, and their fish tacos are cute. I recommend their oreo or white chocolate frozen hot chocolate! . . Service is slow and seemed understaffed but didn't forget or mess up on anything. . . Request to sit outside before it gets too hot in town :)
I couldn't see what people are raving about this place? Oh I take it back. Perhaps it's the crazy portion of the banana split? Or the fudge sundae. Otherwise, it would just be a regular diner's style treats. We waited too long for a table and didn't have any good memory of it. 1 star goes for the cool venue in Caesars Palace, and the other star goes to the cool looking menu.
I have heard people rave and rave about Serendipity Frozen Hot Chocolate so I had to go try it out for myself. We wanted to sit inside, but the wait was long; we had a choice to order from the Togo window or sit outside at the bar. We opt for sitting at the bar and it was nice because the strip was to the back of us and it was a warm day out. . . First we ordered the hot chocolate, i got a appetizer pizza and a Sunday to share. Sad to say that the hot chocolate was just OK. Maybe people over hyped it for me, but i'm a chocolate girl and I felt as if i could have just made that at home and make one that tasted better. I will say that the Sunday was really really good and all it had was vanilla ice cream and chocolate fudge. . . Overall this place was OK but nothing to go crazy for.
I am a hugeeee sweets lover so I was pumped about this place...unfortunately I was let down. Me and my girlfriend split a big ice cream sundae surrounded by cookies. The ice cream was nothing special and the cookies were so stale!! What a let down. Should have done there famous frozen hot choc I guess
Serendipity was okay. Had a great lunch with the homies. We ate outside the patio and it was pretty cool especially the time we went, the weather was awesome! Service was less than mediocre. The food was filling. I feel this is the place to check out at least once while in Vegas, especially if you haven't been here. I didn't try the specialized deserts because I was so full from my meal. Next time I come i'll definitely try it.
Seared Ahi Salad and Frozen Hot chocolate. .to balance out the caloric intake I start with the Ahi Salad and so my trip here is memorable I always follow it up with the frozen hot chocolate love this place....
The only thing I give this place is for the location it's a nice place to visit. But the service and food was horrible. I would rather spend the money at a nicer place with better customer service. The waitress her name started with a "p" she was dismissive and she didn't really have a lot of tables (I've been a waitress before). It looked like everyone else was serving her food, she forgot things we ordered and bad customer service. At the end of lunch we decided to have dessert- but she ignored us and gave us the bill. I guess we won't stay dessert- both worth eating here. Please try to visit tatorria bakery service is fantastic and food is great!
Everytime i come to this place it seems like they don't have enough servers or just simply don't want to serve us. If i was blind maybe i would believe they don't have any tables available. The place is half empty for crying out loud. Maybe it's my race or maybe my luck but it always happens. I would not recommend coming here with a group. The servers simply don't want any business. Maybe that's just my opinion. Rude customer service is not a good example specially when you bring kids here. Don't even bother if customer service is what you're after.
I hade the steak sandwich,  its huge,  and  tasted great. The  frozen hot chocolate is really good too.
Overpriced, slow, and mediocre. We waited in line for a LONG time to get milkshakes that were just ok.
I've heard a lot of good things about Serendipity 3 from my friends who came to Vegas on vacation, but I never had a chance to eat there until recently. Since this place was close to the Linq, a friend and I decided to eat here.. . There was a helpful banner that said that the restaurant was open which was nice since it looked like part of the outside was under construction. We entered from the side and the hostess greeted us warmly before directing us to a table. The decor was a little goofy looking, but I liked it.. . The menu was huge and it took a bit for me to figure out what to order. It finally came down to ordering a portobello mushroom burger with fries because I love mushrooms. My friend ordered a salad with a crab cake.. . The food arrived and the first bite of my burger was amazing. My friend took a bite of her rather large crab cake and was pleased that the crab was fresh instead of frozen. Our waiter kept coming around to ask us how we were doing and refilling our water, which I like.
Tried this place for the 1st time and looooved it! Had the fried Oreo Sunday... Amazing!! The service here was on point also! Totally worth the price!!
Long wait and they aren't even busy. Brunch is served till 2 and they don't let u order off the lunch menu... Waited an hour and all they offeris a cup of coffee for free NEVER EAT HERE
Poor experience overall,  rude hostess, poor waitress / terrible table side manners.   No refills - had to ask for our check twice.. . Food was cold or over cooked - sent back one item and it was never brought back fixed.  Requested for a manager assistance, never came to the table - . . Never again - Daughters Birthday was superiorly ruined.  . . Good Luck with that sort of business procitices
I had the abc burger and the Oreo fried Sunday! The food was okay but definitely recommend the dessert!
Hands down the BEST place in Vegas! They have a really great selection in food and the biggest, richest desserts you'll ever have. The frrrozen hot chocolate is amazing! Great breakfast too and they have a takeout window if you're in a hurry
They suck at helping their customers. They forgot about us and I had to wait 1 hour just to order my food even after hollering at multiple waiters. Their 45 minute wait was a waste of time and this is my second chance for this restaurant. HIRE BETTER STAFF.
Overpriced. Overhyped frozen hot chocolate was not what I expected. Actually it was quite disappointing. It tasted very watery and half of it was whipped cream. Also the food is extremely overpriced. Not coming back here.
i love their frozen hot chocolate, but over this memorial weekend (we went on 5-26-14), the floor crew namely THE HOSTESS/manager who was on duty around 4pm was a very rude person, said we had to have a reservation if ur party is more than 10 peeps (we were 11), they dnt have enough servers and if we decide to stay they have to split our party, we say "ok"  i asked to have our table next to each other , she said "NO" bcoz we'll have diff. servers, what??? why could'nt she just tell us that they cant accomodate our party instead of giving us d run around, AND my friend was even told that if ur undecided "go outside"!!! crappy hostess, i believe we were dress accordingly ( shorts/tops/flipflops since it was in the 100's). Obviously, shes got issues. Got the hell away from her, took our business to noodle beijing!! HIRE a Better person pls
Honestly, the service sucks here. . . It does. They seat you, get your order, and hand you a check.. . However, I cannot pass up their frozen hot chocolate. It's perfect. Especially after a day of walking in the sun and shopping. . . So I'll take my check and my frozen hot chocolate, and I'm happy.
Had dinner here to celebrate a special occasion. The service from Marnie was fantastic! She is very kind and genuine and a keeper if you ask me. I'll be returning just because of her. . . The dish I had was great, Seared Ahi Tuna Salad. Yum! But the other dish, the Steak Sandwich would've been perfect but the bread it came with was thick and tough to eat as it wasn't very soft. I definitely recommend you get the Red Wine Sangria  . . Overall it was a nice experience.
Food was pretty good, especially the frozen hot chocolate. Although, the server wasn't very good. Tried charging extra for my "meal" (froz hot choc and cheeseburger for $26 deal) by saying oh you ordered a double drink not a single, yet it was the small size and I was only charged for the small. Gave me a hard time about removing the $4 extra and when I asked if a manager could remove it since she couldn't, she told me no they won't want to. How rude. Too bad this ruined my first experience at #3.
Best hot chocolate ever, I highly recommend this place as the food is very good as well!
