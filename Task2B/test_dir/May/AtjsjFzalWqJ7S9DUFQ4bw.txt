On a recent trip to Las Vegas we stayed at The Cosmo for two nights. I had stayed there once before and wasn't a fan but had a much better experience this time around. Our room was beautiful. It had a balcony and a huge tub over looking a great view of Vegas. The room was very nicely decorated with a Jonathan Adler feel. . . The gym had great equipment and a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. But they did not offer bottled water, only a water machine with cups, which is not easy to drink while working out. . . There aren't that many breakfast options, which I found frustrating. The main breakfast restaurant had a long wait each morning and the grab and go food only consisted of pastries and coffees. Nothing healthy or fresh. . . The restaurant options in the hotel are quite vast for lunch and dinner. Milos is by far my favorite for lunch and dinner. We also had a nice lunch at China Poblano. . . *Tip: Milos offers food to go, so if you want to eat dinner in your car on your way back to LA get Milos to go rather than having to stop for fast food!
We got there Thursday before valentines day. They got us to bite on a room upgrade.  From first look, it was amazing. We get to the room and in the bathroom I step on an earring the cleaning crew missed. Hurt pretty good, but anything could be missed. Later that night tried to use the tub (the main reason we were sold on the upgrade) and the drain was broken. After 30 mins of filling it was nowhere near full, but after playing with the drain, we Got it to hold some water with a face cloth as a plug, but we had to keep water going most of the timeto make up for it and keep it reasonably full. At midnight it is not worth calling them to fix it. . I Used the iron in the room to get ready for dinner and sure enough it transferred white paint to my clothes (someone put it back on shelf while still hot I imagine and melted the paint onto the iron). . . Day two we came back late at night after a wedding and found housekeeping had not cleaned our room. No towels no nothing. We called down and they brought a few up for us . . Awoken on our checkout day at 9 am by housekeeping. Doesn't make any sense to come into rooms on checkout day when checkout is 11. . . At checkout we were told they would comp our room upgrade and resort fees to make up for it. We found it to be a nice gesture and left feeling ok about our stay. . . A Few days later, sure enough we get charged. Call them up and they say they have no record of saying they will comp us.. . The woman made us feel like idiots hinting that we had no idea what we were talking about and no on would have told us that. I have reviewed several hotels in Vegas, and we have been there about 15 times in the past two years, so we know what we are talking about. . After fighting for it, they ended up refunding our room upgrade and our resort fee. They told us it was "the least they could do". Had it happened at the beginning it would have been a nice gesture, but at the point it occurred it was unimpressive. I would expect more from the premiere hotel on the strip. . . To be fair, there are good restaurants in the hotel, DOCG is great. And if you go to the vesper bar get yourself an espresso martini. Best in the world. It's also a great casino. Does not smell of smoke and the roulette tables light up from underneath, which we found to be ver fun, but those things can be experienced without spending the money to stay there. t's nice it doesn't stink of smoke in casino.
Excellent rates, excellent room, had the villa suite just for $1100 for 3 nights 4 days pictures speak for themselves, will always come back to Vegas to stay here love the buffet as well best in Vegas
Parking is really bad. 30 min only one car moved. Never coming here again. Parking lot is very suffocating to be waiting for ever to get out.
This is a review on my experience in the lobby and the bar only, I didn't get a chance to book a room here.. . My friends and I were celebrating a 30th birthday.  We were able to get three seats at the bar on the main floor.  We had great service from the bartender, Hakim.  He made us fun and special drinks and provided great conversation.  We really enjoyed our time here.  I also enjoyed the fact the people were dressed a lot nicer here than they were in the other hotels.. . I hope I get the opportunity to stay here sometime in the future!
Stayed here for my late birthday celebration with my girrrrrrrls :). This is like my 4th or 5th time heading to the city & we've stayed at many hotels but lusted after staying at the Cosmopolitan because it's GORGEOUS & so fab :). . We weren't disappointed when we checked in. Our bathroom had a huge tub & huge shower. There was a little partition that covered the little opening they had between the room & the bathroom. Our balcony had the BEST view of the strip. We got to see every single Bellagio fountain show from the afternoon to late at night. Our suite had two TV's in it & a dishwasher, lol.. . Now that we were in the middle of the strip all the clubs we went to were on the Mandalay Bay side which is where we stayed many times.... Not Cosmo's fault though, just simply stating the obvious :). . FAB hotel that didn't disapponint :)
Our first time to this hotel, we really enjoyed it. We booked a suite with a fountain view and it was spectacular, nothing like it in Vegas. We booked many months in advance and got a great rate. Our flight arrived early, but they were able to get us into a room before noon -- a big bonus, very efficient at the Front Desk.. . Having stayed many times at the Wynn and Bellagio, we were apprehensive about the Cosmo being too hip and trendy for us, but we were pleasantly surprised by the nice mix of old and new to the property -- there is fun modern art sprinkled throughout as well as many great old photos as an homage to "old Vegas", which we appreciated.. . We loved that you could mostly avoid the Casino level if you wished -- for the most part the restaurants are on the 2nd and 3rd floor, as well as the upper level of the Chandelier Bar. The other two lounges, The Vesper and the Queue are very nice and comfortable. The Queue was more private and secluded and had the best Cosmopolitan I have ever had (appropo!) You had access to the Strip via a walking bridge from the 2nd floor (and the Walgreens across the street, which was very handy). . The hotel room was very nice, with some oddities: there are no bureaus for clothes, just the closet with a few shelves. BUT they provided robes and slippers, which was great. And hubby like that they had a suit valet, classy touch. The suite was lovely, with sliding doors from the main area and the bedroom out to the balcony and great sound-proofing.  The balcony is ridiculously fabulous, with the view of the Strip and the Bellagio Fountains. We spent a lot of time out there, and even when it was windy, we were protected. The bathrooms were lovely, spacious with good amenities (and a whirlpool tub, which was enjoyed throughout the stay!) There was a small kitchen, with a full-size fridge, so you could actually fit your own beer/wine/food (just be careful not to touch anything else or you will be charged!). . Two requests called into Guest Services were handled almost immediately, which was a nice touch.. . The pool areas were nice, but small (from what we are used to) but we managed to find a good spot at the more quiet Bamboo Pool. There was a pool bar at each end, very nice. The other pool was more hip/noisy so we stayed away.. . The Spa was lovely, as you would expect -- and ridiculously expensive, as you would expect.. . The only complaint we had was housekeeping. When we arrived into the room, it didn't feel complete, like they had not totally put the room together. This theme continued through our stay, housekeeping was very inconsistent in how they cleaned/prepped the room (sometimes a full set of towels and bath mats/rugs, sometimes not; not always emptying the trash, sometimes not coming at all.) It was odd, considering the caliber of the hotel. We did share this feedback in a survey we received when we got home.. . We would absolutely recommend the Cosmopolitan, there is something for everyone -- young and hip, or older (like us! ;-)
OK this is the place to see & be seen. A much younger crowd than the other hotels & casinos on the strip. A really cool hip vibe to it, lots of lounges tucked away from the casino areas, lots of "brides to be" with their party regalia on strolling through. Its a sight to see. Stopped at one of the lounges, had some drinks, dont know the price, because someone treated, but Im guessing it was high. Maybe overpriced for what you get, but you have to check them out. The lobby itself is a show to be seen, and if you happen to be there you are part of it.
Handsome and I stayed here last June and we had the best time! When we first arrived our rooms weren't ready yet. We waited and waited and we kept checking in and they kept telling us it wasn't ready. It was almost 3 hours later and we had had enough. We went and asked them about the room and they apologized and gave us a large credit that we could use at the hotel. This made us a lot happier and got our trip going in the right direction. . . We got to our room and it was absolutely gorgeous and we had the best view! The room was very clean and art deco like. Very gorgeous . Our room overlooked The Bellagio Fountains so we got to see the show every half hour/hour.  I have pictures of our view. We had a huge shower and a deep jacuzzi tub. The bed was very plush and comfy. Even the couch in our room was very comfy! Such a great place! I would love to come back here and wish to soon!
Superb experience from beginning to end. The staff is extremely willing to cater to your every desire. I will definitely be returning each time I am in the area. Thank you to the entire staff that helped provide such an outstanding experience!! Highly recommended.
If you are 12 years old you will probably love this place but as an adult you should probably avoid this place. The 12 year olds doing the face plant at the pools and in the lobby would normally turn every one off but when the cocktail waitresses bring you a drink and try and fool you - what I don't know what I drink??? This place is lame and any serious person who comes to Vegas as I do should avoid this place like the plague  - Steve Wynn still doesn't lie to people and provides a greats service. Cosmo SUCKS!
If I could give this place 0 stars I totally would.,.. I had soooo many ppl recommend me this place and I ended up having to check out at midnight and look for a room at the tropicana.. First off when I made the reservation I specifically asked for a room with a nice view got the keys went up to the room and was super disappointed that my terrace faced the freeway and all I could see was the aria what a waste.The room was nowhere near spotless seems like they just took a rag and wiped everything down real quick.so not only was i disappointed but I had to walk all the way back to registration to switch out my keys and get a New room mind you with all my luggage in my hands not to mention the east tower is on the other side of the world from the registration  This room was nice great view just what I asked for and this one was actually clean.thanks to Joey (the bellman) we got to take a little break from our luggage he happily helped us up and made friendly conversation with us.in order to use the elevator u need to insert a room key..retarded .not to mention the elevators take foreverrrr.I even had someone warn me "don't go in that elevator we were just stuck for 30mins" so after wasting about an hour to check in finally got into my room.11pm knock knock guess who security and the "director"5 effin guys at my door acting like I just broke a law or something...it was not that serious.. So considering I'm paying 800 for my room I expect to be able to do whatever I want with it right? Wrong .. I booked this room for my birthday and had a few friends over 10max we had literally just put some music on and were just hanging out no one has getting crazy or anything hell no one was even drunk yet.but all of a sudden there were noise complaints...BS!!  My bro in law said when he came up to the room you couldn't  hear anything,so here come all the security asking if they can look around I'm over here thinking oh well we're doing nothing bad so yeah go ahead.i should of said no ..idk wth I was thinking total invasion of privacy.so they say I have to many ppl in my room that the max# of ppl who can stay is 4 uhmmm I'm the only one staying I kept saying and they just kept saying they have a zero tolerance for parties so they wanted me to ask my guest to leave and literally stayed at the door till I basically kicked them out..well if my guest were leaving so was i..I asked if it was possible to get my money back and the only thing the director was so worried about was how he had already lost value in this room until one of the guys pulled him to the side and told him to just do it .so I ended up getting half of my money back but I still thought this was totally unfair.i understand if we had the room trashed and were being loud but that was def not the case I ended having to go check in the tropicana at 1am I even told them I had a few guest and they were totally ok with it never even came once to bug us... I felt punching the director in the face for not even feeling bad about how unhappy I was whatever happened to the customer comes first,. I kept asking them what kind of room i could of gotten that would be ok to have my friends over not stay just have over i was willing to pay extra and they just kept saying nope nope.ha what a joke so much for upselling . Screw you Cosmo first and last time I stay here. Thanks for making me waste my time and money.btw no party policy my a** ppl throw parties in ur rooms all the time.hell the ppl in the room next to me were smoking weed its all good ill be sure to NEVER recommend anyone here that stay was a joke.
These 5 stars goes for the reservation process! I had such an easy time booking through Deborah from reservations. She really helped me book at the best price and room! Definitely going to go back soon!
We have stayed at the Cosmo 3 times as of February 2014, all in a years time.  . . I love the wraparound terrace rooms.  Trust me when I say it is WELL WORTH the extra cost to upgrade to one of these suites.  Try to get one on the side where you can watch the Bellagio fountain from your balcony.  Awesome!  . . Room service (food and cleaning both) has always been phenomenal...the food is excellent and the staff friendly.  I have always felt like a VIP at this hotel.  They have always accommodated me fully.
Awesome place to stay. My room was beautiful and I won good money on the slots! Will stay there again. Great place
One of the best hotels in Las Vegas. The customer service is first class. If you are gambler or non gambler you will be treated with great service. I love the hotel VIP customer service and fast room service. If you are looking for a location on the strip that is steps away from all the attractions and main casinos you found the place. . . If you are person who enjoys gambling and looking for an excellent casino host I would highly recommend Mickey Petkus. Mickey has been my casino host for over 16 years and Mickey is really an excellent host. . . If you are just coming here for a night or a weekend you will love it. The hotel has excellent restaurants to clubs. It all depends how what your evening brings you.
The Cosmopolitan was the site for my buddy's bachelor party. We had access to a penthouse suire... the wraparound deck and a butler's touch was amazing. Of course living room was spacious enough to entertain the guests.. . We had access to a Bungalow at the Marquee pool. This really made the trip. All day/night access to Marquee. Top floor had a jacuzzi overlooking Marquee. Middle floor, a bathrrom and bed w same view. Bottom floor, a kitchen and living room spacious enough to host the entertainment. . . But what really, really earns my 5 star: in all that mess I left my tablet after I checked out. A day or so ago, lost and found contacts me and sends it back, 2 day priority, for only $10.. . Ive got a new favorite place to stay in Vegas.
Just a big cluster f@!#, over priced in everything, the concert venue SUCKS, the location, the rules and once again pricing. . Just not a pleasant experience.
Awful hotel . Don't plan to book if you plan to have a party that Is more than 4 people since they have a zero party policy . You will be kicked out . Should of stayed at the Venetian or the mirage.
great view!  very neat place.. service was good.. some of the items were moved around in the fridge and we just had to tell them that we accidently knocked it over.. very convinient.. went to the day club and the service was ok..
Beautiful and great for conventions. Ingress and egress is a bit complicated; the driveway is way long and difficult to navigate by foot or in a car. Would highly recommend. Good place to lose your money.
Very chic hotel with a cool chandelier bar! It's right across the street from the shopping mall (planet hollywood) and next to Bellagio, so the location is great!  We stayed here 2 nights for the Bruno Mars concert that we in the theater and loved it! Tons of casual and fancy restaurants to choose from too!  China Poblano was one of our favs that was casual and oh so delicious!
I enjoyed my stay at the cosmopolitan up until check out. Check out was a horrible experience. This is due to the fact that I incidentally placed a stack of money on to my room service cart and noticed I did that after they took it away. Not 5 min after room service took the cart, I reported it and it took the cosmopolitan approximately 2 hours to respond. So when we located the cart of COURSE it was not on there any more. It just breaks my heart how un-loyal, disrespectful and dishonest the employees of cosmopolitan were. I wrote a report, but still have not heard back from them and I don't expect to hear back from them considering they have already shown me their true colors of dishonesty.
Didn't stay here but we got stuck in their elevator for an hour. Had a terrible experience sitting in an elevator with a bunch of ladies who were freaking out and we got comped dinner at Milo's which took forever to bring the food out. I will never stay here nor will I ever come to their restaurants or shops ever. Should of called the fire department as soon as the elevator stopped.
This place was okay. We stayed in a suite and had to request room service three times before they finally came at 11pm. I was sleeping. The staff is very nice and respectable.
We've stayed here a lot over the last few years and just got back from our 8th stay at the hotel.  We've never been disappointed.  Yes, there are minor issues from time to time -- just like there would be at any Vegas strip hotel -- but overall, the Cosmo is great.. . This time, we stayed in a wraparound terrace suite (definitely do this if you can, because the room can't be beat).  If you go on a weekday, the prices are reasonable ... especially if you're a frequent guest who gambles there like we do.  We got a promotional offer for a free terrace studio, but when we arrived this time, they had an upgrade to a wraparound terrace suite available for $100 a night.  That's a great deal when you consider these rooms can sometimes go for $600, $700 or more on a busy weekend in season.. . Check-in is always smooth.  We had one glitch with a delayed check-in when we arrived on a late Friday afternoon once, but I kind of always expect that in Vegas.  Know your surroundings.  If you're going on a holiday weekend or a late Friday, it's not going to be as easy as on a Tuesday afternoon.. . The hotel skews on the younger side... 20s, 30s for sure.  And it's a goodlooking, hip crowd for the most part.  Some d-bag types, yeah.  But isn't that expected in Vegas?  One thing you don't see here:  a lot of families.  And that's good in my eyes.  This is not one of those hotels with kids everywhere or prudes from the midwest on a tight budget.. . Staff has always been friendly on our multiple visits -- and again this time on our most recent trip.  Rooms are always top notch, and we've stayed in all sizes of rooms here.  Even their terrace studios are very nice and comfortable.  Bathrooms always exquisite and modern, and the decor inside is hip... even down to the wallpaper in the closet.. . Wicked Spoon buffet is great.  It's not at all like a typical Vegas buffet... interesting selections, a lot in individual containers (a big plus).  It's pricey (over $40 per person for dinner), but oddly enough, it's worth it.  The desserts are little works of art.  We've tried most of the restaurants here over the last couple of years and have been disappointed in only one of them -- China Poblano, which is very overrated.  Avoid that one, but the others are all good.. . We're not Marquee visitors and not the "club" type, per se.  But you don't have to be to stay here.  The hotel is upscale, fun & hip without being all that pretentious.  And it's one of the least smoke-filled casinos on the strip, we've found... plus all rooms are non-smoking.  For those who smoke, nearly every room has a balcony (rare in Vegas, but the views are amazing!).. . I figure if you're in Vegas, treat yourself.  The Cosmopolitan is the way to go, in my mind.  We'll see if it changes now that the hotel is being sold, however.   They're undergoing a transition so hopefully it won't change too much.
Stayed here for Memorial Day weekend. By far exceeded my expectations and service. Everything from the room to the view was exceptional. It's by far the trendiest hotel on the strip, high caliber, and has a younger customer base. The bars and clubs are very tasteful and and modern I especially enjoyed the Marquee and Rose.Rabbit.Lie, the chandelier lounge ( which is the focal point of the hotel ) features a nightly jazz band that everyone is welcome to enjoy. The rooms are on point from details to furniture, featuring deco art, hues of blue/silver/white/black coloring. The casino is kept clean, this is also the only hotel with exception of Aria that doesn't hit you with the smell of smoke upon entry. I wouldn't stay anywhere else.
I've had to call back easily over ten times trying to get my $150deposit back..this last time they told me it was posted on the14 but my account activity shows nothing I asked for an emailed copy of something saying that they sent out my deposit and they said they didn't have anything they could send me but to still call my bank and figure it out i stayed at the tropicana and recieved my deposit the next day,. I didn't even end up staying at the Cosmo and I still have to deal with their BS
I stayed here for a bachelorette party in the beginning of May and they were very accommodating! We got a suite with an awesome balcony view of bellagio's water show.  Very pretty!  We emailed beforehand and worked with a couple of reps for the best prices.  They even gave us a really good deal on cabanas (bottle service) for Marquee day club.  Our cabana was inside the pool and we had so much fun!  Their prices were better than any promoter's prices!
My favorite hotel and casino! So clean and entertaining, really good drinks and I love the Henry!!
The hotel gives the air of sophistication and luxury, but there are gaps in the service levels you would expect from a luxury modern hotel.  . . Overall, loved the room. The one-bedroom suite was beautiful with wrap around walk-out balcony looking out on the strip and Bellagio fountains.  Two bathrooms with the master having a large tub, walk in shower, and two sink areas was perfect.  The furnishings and lighting were what you would expect in a well-appointed suite.  But, the power outlet at the desk did not always work leaving mobile devices and laptops out of juice when you expected them charged. The full kitchen was large enough if you wanted to cook and stay in - but no cooking equipment or dinnerware was available.  Not a big deal on this stay, but if you have a kitchen, make it useful.  Couldn't find the coffee pot, which was a big deal.. . Maid service was inconsistent.  Towels weren't always taken away if put in the tub or not restocked.  Toiletries were randomly replaced.  Turn down service was inconsistent.    Trash was inconsistently emptied. (stayed for 4 days).. . The room service was excellent.  Quoted 1/2 hour and they came in 20 minutes.  I ordered something that wasn't on the menu and they easily accommodated me.  When it came, it was delicious.  They also removed the tray the next morning without me having to call down or put it in the hallway. . . Attended a conference and the service was sub-par.  They couldn't keep up with the demand.  Buffets ran out of food and drinks.  Coffee centers weren't replenished quickly.  Napkin and silverware removed when getting dessert and was told they would come back with fresh ones - never happened.  Internet bandwidth couldn't keep up in session rooms and hiccuped during keynotes.  . . Tried to use the online check-in service which never worked after several attempts.  Ended up checking in at the desk where the clerk seemed to struggle a bit with the system.  I was also told about how little sleep she got the night before and why.  TMI for this level of hotel.. . The Henry is a great restaurant.  The bar was perfect to watch the games and talk with friends.  Breakfast was really good - especially the hashbrowns.  Service in the dining room was a bit slow and they didn't bring butter for the toast, but overall it was a good experience.  Went to several of the restaurants in the mall area and all were excellent - good wine, good food.  But again, service was always a bit lack luster.. . Wanted to go to the pool to swim, but it had too much of a dating scene feel and passed.. . In general, nice hotel that has the potential to compete with the other luxury hotels on the strip.  But, if you are expecting the high level of service, it is a bit of a miss.
Shoe fetishists welcome! I enjoyed a fun, intoxicated evening finding all of the stilettos in the Cosmopolitan and taking photos with them. I also enjoyed the random pool tables and sparkly chandeliers. The price isn't so bad for what you get, especially considering the location and the newness of the hotel/casino. I would stay here in a heartbeat.
