Very small store front, looks like a hole in the wall greasy spoon but acts like a mid range place. Prices were not bad. I would not do nachos again, very dry and bottom chips were bare. Salsa mixes were on point.
You want cheap eats and delicious food and be full for around $12 for two people? Come here. No, really, don't, because the parking lot is small as hell. It's tucked away in a tiny plaza with the smallest parking ever. Not bad at all during the weekday and off-hours though.. . The place itself is tiny. There's only one big group table for 5+, but there's about seven-to-eight tables for 4-people. So if you plan on coming with a big group on a friday/saturday night, it's ideal to call ahead and make a reservation. Komex also does pick-up orders. . . I've been here several times and it never disappoints. . . Chips, salsa, and guacamole are complimentary starters here. . . First-timers ought to order their fusion tacos! Tacos are about $2.25 each and you get 3 choices for meat: spicy pork, chicken, or beef (pork is the best!). If you're hungry, 3 is enough for most people. They load that taco up with lettuce, tomatoes, and meat. What makes it fusion? The way they prepare their meat! Korean-style supposedly. The meat isn't fatty or overly greasy. The tacos are balanced well with the overflowing sliced cabbage and rich flavor of the meat. . . For the health-conscious, they do offer the taco on butterfly cabbage instead of your normal flour/corn tortilla on the menu. Trust me, somehow it's bigger. You want kimchi too? They offer it as an extra cost as well.. . If you're ordering their fried rice (kimchi/regular) or bulgogi fries, they offer both half-size and full-size orders. Their half-orders are formidable! Split-worthy huge. Their full-size are just gut-expanding, self-loathing, raid-your-fridge-at-night huge. Both dishes are loaded with toppings and flavorful. You won't really get "tired" eating either one.  My friend and I get a couple of tacos each and split the half-size fried rice normally. So filling that we have argue who has to get the last bite.... . At the end of every meal, they come out with a nicely cut split orange as the perfect ending to all that heavy food. . . Out of the many times I've been here, they've gone through quite a few servers. For such a small place, sometimes they do neglect refilling my water, especially when it's super busy. But, on most of my visits, it's consistently attentive. . . Downside? Not open late nights (they close around 8pm daily) and they are closed on Mondays. Nobody likes mondays anyway.. . This place is awesome. I'm not always wowed, but this place deserves five stars in my book. Will it blow you away like five stars might suggest? Probably not, but you can't beat the price, service, consistency, and the solid food.
Def as good as it gets.. Remember, it's a hole-in-the-wall with limited seating serving common-man food.. If you want haute cuisine, go elsewhere.. First night in town, "Gotta try something new and different." We're from Burlington, Vt and while the quality of food ingredients are second-to-none, there are lot of options when it comes to ethnic cuisine. And it can't really get weird, it is Vermont, after all. . Anyhow, KoMex Fusion sounded adventuresome. Having spent time in Seoul and being a big fan of winter-style kimchee, was looking forward to reacquainting myself. . First of all, do NOT order a full order of the nachos unless you're sharing with four or more. Half size nearly did me in. I had it with the bolgogi beef. Hope I spelled that right. Good chips, fine bolgogi, way enough cheese. Had the bolgogi beef burrito as a main course.. . Let me tell you, one of the finest burritos I have ever had. Ever. Lots of beef, lots of slaw, great flavors. I am not ashamed (well, maybe a bit) to admit that I hurt myself finishing it off. Kept dipping into the hot sauces, little of this, one bite. Well, how about a little of that. Ummmm. How about a little of each. . . Another sign, I did not try the wife's tacos. She might not have let me. . . Looking forward to a return visit.
I've had my fair share of Korean-Mexican fusion food back in California, but I wanted to try this out after hearing about it from friends. Overall, the menu has decent variety of Ko-Mex selections, ranging from burritos, tacos, fries, rice, etc.. . We ordered:. . 1. Fusion Burrito ($7.50): You can choose from beef/chicken/pork as your meat. The burrito comes with Mexican rice, green & brown onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, and lettuce. Overall, the burrito was delicious and the flavors were great. This is great for sharing between 2 people. (5/5). . 2. Fusion Flautas ($8.00): They come in 3 pieces. You can choose between beef/chicken/pork bulgogi, but we opted for one of each just to get variety. The flautas are rolled in flour tortillas and deep-fried with guacamole and cheese. YUM! The chicken was our favorite as it was tender and juicy. We thought the pork was a bit too spicy for our taste, and the beef was all right. (4/5). . KoMex is off the strip and more of a hole in the wall place. Locals love it and I am a fan! The service is pretty friendly too.
I was pretty disappointed in the place after reading son many good reviews and hearing so many good things about the place. I for one wasn't impressed at all. Everything was so so. We ordered the chicken flautas, spicy bulgogi chimichanga, bulgogi enchiladas, quesadilla, and pork belly tacos. The pork belly tacos were the stand out. I would order that again, the rest, just ordinary for me. Not great korean food and not so great mexican food combined....just ok.
Love love the Fusion Fries and Tacos. Next time we are in LV we are coming back to eat!
I love this place... One of those hole in the wall type place with the best food... If you have not tried it please give it a chance..
Great service, great food!  What a unique blend of flavors and artistic interpretation.  Best burrito I've ever had!  Fired Kimchi unbelievable!  Keep up the good work!
Short: Surprisingly great fusion place. Reasonable prices, great flavor, in an older part of town.. . Long: Came here with a friend. Ordered three tacos with the three types of meat (there are more, for extra). Came with cabbage slaw and some "salsa" on top (not spicy, but wouldn't call it pico-de-gallo). Afterward, was served chips with salsa and guacamole (kinda watered down, though). . Food was great. All the meats had strong flavor, the slaw on top contrasted with them nicely. I think I liked the beef best (forgot which one was which). What really surprised me was the side-sauces that were a real treat for someone like me. Nice touch.. You do pay a small premium though. $2 for each taco is a bit much when they're not full sized, as you can get around the same size in other places for $1.25/75. . . Come here if you want to try a different spin on mexican food. There's better places out there, but not as unique as this one.
Komex is a Korean/Mexican infused restaurant. Hence KO-MEX. . . I love Mexican food but as for Korean I'm still debating if I'm a fan. But together they make some pretty good dishes. . . My usual order is the Bulgogi fusion fries. Bulgogi is beef that had been marinated Korean style. It kind of has a sweat taste to it. You can also get the fries with any other meat that they have like: carne asada, chicken, etc.. . They also have spam masubi w/ fried egg which I think is pretty cleaver. Because we all eat spam and eggs together anyways so why not in a masubi! . . Also when you order a soda they bring out a bottle soda & not a can or from a fountain.. . Last visit took a while for our orders to be taken and for water to arrive. But, other times I been here service has been steady.
My overall review 2.5/5. Service 5/5 (but...had the nerve to charge gratuity 20% when we were the only table in the restaurant ?!). Food 2/5. Ambiance 0/5 . . 4.5 stars review from fellow yelpers, but the food just wasn't up to par.. Something's not adding up here... . *note for the cook, not every dish needs black pepper, less is more sometimes! Not sure if you have tried your food lately but most of your dishes are missing something !! This is Korean Mex fusion , here's a clue, add some creamy sauce to your Mexican inspired dishes*. . Now .. My Background ... I'm from California so maybe the fusion here . just can't beat it. Most of the dishes seemed to be missing just a little something... I was not impressed. We came here from Utah after hiking all day. Our group of 7 was hungry and ready to chow down.. . I'll start with the best and go down the list. Here is what we ordered.. . Kim chi fried rice 5/5. I'm a sucker for kim chi fried rice, some people like it, some don't. Me, I love a good kim chi fried rice. This dish packs a moist and flavorful punch in every bite. This is a must order!. . Bulgogi cheese steak 4/5. Docked one star because you need to put sauce on each bite to taste the fusion. The "bulgogi" was not very seasoned. In general it was a good sandwich for you cheesesteak lovers.. . Bulgogi chimichanga 3/5. Hey, where's the meat? Totally just a few scraps in my chimichanga  ? This also needed much sauce with each bite... And why was there black pepper poured all over the top? There is never black pepper on chimichangas or bulgogi!! Why did you put it ? It totally threw off the taste!!. . Kimchi side dish 2/5. Hmmm, flavor was good, but $3 for kimchi.. And it's served warm and mushy.. Wttthhhhheck?? This should be cold and only served cold... . Spicy pork fusion nachos 2/5. Oh Koja kitchen, you've ruined me for eveyone else. There was no white sauce on these nachos, and this dish too was missing a certain something .. At least there was no black pepper on this one. Also just a few crumbs of meat accompanied this dish.. . Wonton 1/5. Don't order it. Wonton skins soft and soggy, meat filling one dimensional, dry and lacking flavor. Again, heavy handed chef with black pepper overload in the soup but forgot to season the meat in the wonton.. . Bulgogi plate 1/5. Dry, super plain and bland presentation. Doesn't look Korean/Mexican/Chinese/American ... Don't order this here !!!. . Burrito 1/5  I didn't try it but it looked dry and standard.. Very plain..., I asked my friend who ate it and one word. "Meh" Nothing special here to try folks!. . I dropped my fork and our waitress heard ,( probably due to the empty restaurant and the cling of my fork falling broke the sound of the crickets in the background ) she quickly came over and replaced it right away. Although I rated this 5/5 service, I suppose she earned the 20% gratuity we were never informed of.. . . Overall, I won't be back. I was wondering how my experience food wise can differ so much from other yelpers. Apparently, another yelper pointed out a change of ownership. That would explain it.. . The restaurant was empty during dinnertime, new ownership, you should probably be reading these reviews and stepping up your game.. . . Btw most people like meat.. And with the little customers your have trickling in now a days, you should probably give people more meat to make them happier with your sub par food, unoriginal menu and dull flavors. . Note for hungry yelpers, my ballers on a budget.  If you are hungry and need a cheap bite off the strip, you don't need to come out here! Check out all the Asian restaurants off spring mountain. It's a 2-5 min drive from the strip and you can find anything you want there.
I was skeptical ... however I went with a few friends that had already been a few times and swore by Komex - so I had to see what the hype was about - overall I was pleasantly happy and surprised - small location - good luck with the parking - however everything else was great - . . Great service, great food!  What a unique blend of flavors and artistic interpretation.  Best infused "burrito" I've ever had!  Fired Kimchi unbelievable!  Keep up the good work!
I was really looking forward in trying this place. I have to say I was little disappointed in the the value. The tacos where priced well but the other items where alittle pricey. They should spend some money on the decor and the sign in front of me reminding me that it's going to take longer should be not be blasted of front of me. I recommend a simple sign or simple verbal reminder. A quick cleaning goes a long way. But try the lettuce pork belly tacos.  The asian guy was not really happy to see us! A smile goes a long way:)
It was my first time and will be my last visit. I don't know where and how this place got 4.5 stars from yelpers. There were 8 of us dined in tonight. We got separate bill and 20% tip was added to each bill. . . My friends ordered chimichanga, burrito, kimchi fried rice, and pork sliders. I was the only one ordered pan fried fish. I asked if the they deep fried or breaded. The waitress told me they grilled the fish. What? But I'm an adventurous food lover, so I went ahead and gave it a chance anyway. What a disappointment! My dish was the last to came out. The fish fillet was cold, bland, soggy, and felt apart as soon as I touched it with the fork, so I asked for a chopsticks instead. The vegetables, mostly broccoli, with few pieces of onion, and green bell pepper were also tasteless. I couldn't tell if they were grilled or pan fried. Standard Korean sticky rice came with it, nothing special. I barely eaten my food. Most of my friends didn't finish their neither. . . I was going to get the Calypso Lemonade, but decided to skip it after how disappointed my food was. . . My advice: spend your money elsewhere. This place doesn't worth the drive up to North Las Vegas.
Sweetness overload.. . Ordered the bulgolgi fries and taco. Everything was soooo sweet, I barely got to half of my meal. The sauces were sweet too!  It's suppose to be a spicy sauce, but there was no hint of spice.. . When I think of Mexican and Korean food, I think of spicy & this was none of that. . . My friend had the bulgolgi cheesesteak and she said it was alright, but also claimed that it was sweet.. . Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place, it's nothing near to Mexican or Korean when the flavor of everything was just sweet and nothing else.
Bulgogi all around! Those who have gone to KBBQ with me know of my love for bulgogi. Take that love and throw in a blend of Korean and Mexican style cooking, and you've got yourself a winner! I love this place! Each bite I took was an explosion of deliciousness that had the right amount of spice and a perfect balance between Korean and Mexican flavor.. . I think my absolute favorite dish are the kimchee fried rice. I went with my family and we ordered two plates: one with spam and and one with beef bulgogi. They were both equally good and despite having our own entrees, we cleaned up the fried rice because it was just irresistible. It's as good as any of the best kimchee fried rice you'd have at, thrown in with meats that were cooked to a savory excellence. The fried rice was definitely more Korean so you won't find much Mexican fused into this dish.. . For my own entrees I split fusion tacos with my cousin. We had beef bulgogi (duh) and pork belly. These were definitely a split balance between Korean and Mexican style. I couldn't decide which one I liked better but I certainly recommend going with the fusion tacos because you have a lot of choices depending on what kind of meats you like.. . I felt really bad because we showed up at 7:30 (they close at 8) and I was worried we might encounter some annoyance with showing up so late, but we got none of that. I really appreciate them being very welcoming, not showing any annoyance with us and still delivering quality food. Can't wait to come back here!
A great place to check out if you happen to be simultaneously craving Korean food and Mexican food. It's a small restaurant with decent fusion menu items. Came here the other night about 30 minutes until closing so I was a bit nervous about how we'd be treated and the quality of the food. Once we arrived,  however, we were welcomed with all smiles and my worries were gone. The service was awesome. Our orders were taken and brought out in promptly fashion. . . We ordered two plates of Kimchi Fried Rice (spam and beef bulgogi) and being a such a sucker for kimchi anything, I loved both. I prefer a little more of a spice factor, but it was still delicious. I also had the Fushion Tacos; one beef bulgogi and one pork belly, which were also quite tasty. The meats were well-seasoned (not too sweet or salty) and cooked to perfection. They were also very generous in filling the tacos. Whoop! Regardless of being close to closing time, all of our dishes were made fresh, which definitely made our experience with the food so enjoyable. I'd recommend any of their fusion items and most definitely the kimchi fried rice! Yumm.. . If you're in the area and looking for tasty Korean-Mexican fusion with good service, check this place out!
Their food is delicious!!  We have never had Korean/Mexican fusion before.  We are so happy we tried this place out.  We ordered bulgogi fries, bulgogi nachos, bulgogi sliders, and fusion burrito.  The portions are HUGE.  Next time, we will just share an entree.  The prices are very good for what you get.  The staff is super friendly.  We will definitely be back for more.
That moment when the food and the stars don't match up. For me fusion is Kogi, because it's literally two different types of food coming together: synergy. This place is more like segregation, the food just doesn't mix well. It's quite literally Mexican food and Korean food, served like a layer cake, none of it is combined in any culinary way. The burrito I got was dry, it was just bulgogi and lettuce in a wrapped, me choking with every bite on the way down. I won't continue, it just didn't do the job of fusing. Best part of that meal was my Mexican coke, which was what I got when I ordered a Mexican pepsi.
Over charged!! 7 dollars extra for pork belly instead of beef, when the plate itself is 10 dollars!!! Dingy dirty place!!! Cheaper at a nice korean or mexican resturaunt... should not call this place korean or mexican food its a really bad version on both! Nothing authentic nor fusion about it!! Not going back
Got the Beef Fusion Burrito that is filled with lots of flavor.  Expect to wait because seating is small..
Fun new place, very low key, good prices and I like how they mix cultures and foods from around the world. Very unique flavor, great taste. Very friendly staff too! Love it.
The BOMB!!! One of the best fusion spots I've had the pleasure of dining. The tacos, pasta, burritos...it's all good!!!
