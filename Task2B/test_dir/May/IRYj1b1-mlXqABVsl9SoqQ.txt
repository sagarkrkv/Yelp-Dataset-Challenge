HOLY FUDGE!. . Best TACO EVER. I am a native Texan and I haven't ever had a taco as good as El Gordo. Honestly I wasn't even drunk when I ate here. I came here around the dinner hour and it was busy but not slammed. I ordered the adobada based on the Yelp recommendations. SO SO SO SO GOOD! The meat is roasted on a spit and carved off with a huge knife. It is served on two small corn tortillas, topped with onions, cilantro and an avocado cream sauce. I also ordered the asada which was good too, but not amazing like the pork. . . So yeah, I came here twice in one day. Both times got tacos and the 2nd time got tacos and  tostada. NOT EVEN SORRY. At $2 a pop El Gordo won't break the bank and will fill you up and leave you wanting more. Just remember they are smallish so don't feel bad if you have 6. lol. . . Come here sober the 1st time and most definitely come back if you are drunk.
The tacos were ok. Be sure that if you order take out for a large group, that you specifically ask for utensils, napkins, etc.
I came  here with my kids and wife yesterday. They have amazing food and the best service . Best taco restaurant in Vegas . Go check it out .
The closest you will get to real authentic tacos from mexico.  Best tacos in Vegas!!!!
This place has some of the BEST tacos in Vegas! And I've tried pretty much every place in this town! Tacos El Gordo doesn't even compare!! This is my favorite place to get a fantastic taco! They are incredibly packed with flavor and served traditionally but with a great little twist. I don't know how they do it, but they are consistent every time. . . I always order the tacos Al Pastor with everything on it! Thee most incredible flavor in a taco you will ever try! It doesn't matter how packed the place is late at night, they are quick, consistent, and above all very friendly people! Ask for the grilled veggies too!. . What else is there to say...THEE BEST TACO JOINT IN VEGAS!!!
I am a big fan of this place. They have really good tacos and mulas. Every time I come to vegas I stop here for a bite to eat. Prices are resonable and the employes are all pleasant. It can be very busy at times but it is worth the wait and I have recomended this place to friends and family ...
Really good authentic tacos..I have tried every kind of meat and they are all great. Good price.   Im never dissapointed when I come here.
Their al pastor tacos are ridiculous...best I've ever had!!  Be prepared to wait though.  It took me around 45 minutes to get my food :(
Exellent tacos all around.
Very good flavor, cheap tacos $2.00 , so good my husband order twice definitely going back to this place.
Erin es gordo.  Amazing tacos at $2 a pop makes this a must visit when in vegas. I tried the spicy pork, the beef shoulder and the steak with all the fixings.  The meat is tender, the topping are perfect (different salsas depending on the meat) and the price can't be beat.
Extremely impressed. My asada tacos were amazing and my husband said his asada sopes were ridiculous good like they are at King Taco in LA. Lines were quick and short, took us a total of 3 minutes to order, wait for our food, and pay. Will be back for sure!! Just get lots of napkins!
Love the tacos here!! They are authentic tacos they have taco meat we like to eat asada lengua pastor and more! Best place to go at the end of the night! This place also has carneasada fries and lengua fries not to mention mulitas!
First off...there's only two cities that have this restaurant. Las Vegas and Tijuana. I came to this location once & I'm in love!!! So happy my boyfriend recommended it!! Their tacos are totally delicious!!! The real deal; very authentic, if you want GREAT Mexican food. $2 a tacos too!!! Can't beat that. More reason, to rent a car, just to go to this place, because it is a little out of the way, even if your taking the duece. I don't want to waste any time getting there. I just wanna EAT!! I understand why this place gets so crowded. . . Inside, obviously gets packed, so its best to sit outside in the patio area. Ya......EVERY visit to Vegas, I'm definitely eating here...no doubt. You just have to check it out yourself!! I can't wait to try their other stuff!! =D
This was mine & my boyfriends first time here. Aaaaaand, it DID NOT disappoint. This place is amazing. The service was super fast & friendly. And the food was of amazing quality and taste. The prices are perfect..$2 for an authentic Mexican tasting taco?! That's unbeatable. Definitely coming back when I'm in town again.
Are you having a dry spell. Are you in need of a food-gasm? This is the place to go for some authentic food south of the border!!
I have to say it is the best taco in town. We stopped by this taco shop at 2am after clubbing. It is a good hang over food! The only problem is long waiting line.
Was really expecting to eat some delicious tacos. We stood in line for a good fifteen minutes while I pondered my choices and schemed how I would force the others to get more things that I wanted to steal. But just when we had moved up a bit in line, some worker came around and informed us that our line (which was one out of like fucking five thousand or something) was ONLY for al pastor tacos. That's about the most retarded system I've ever heard of. If you want to try more than one thing, you either have to pick some special super-secret line OR spend a few hours eating tacos while waiting in various lines. I'm not even sure where you pay. We ended up leaving, along with a bunch of other angry drunk people who didn't want to eat only al pastor tacos.
Just like it's a good sign when you go into a Japanese restaurant and all of the workers are Japanese... you know you're going to get some good Mexican food when you walk into a Mexican place and all of the workers (and most customers) are Mexican!  And this place rocked!  The menu is simple - think the taco version of In and Out Burger menu.  Just tacos, fries, and that's pretty much it.   The adobado tacos, $2 each, amazing!  Pork marinated in a red chili sauce with vinegar and oregano.  There is one line for all things abodabo, so make sure you're in the right line.  We also got the abodabo fries - the same pork over fries with a bunch of yummy sauce all over it!  And the half order is HUGE!  The other line is for all other tacos - we also got carne asada tacos.  Those were good too but I'm an abodabo fan!  You can also get a side of grilled veggies.  And then there's a jalapeno, lime, and radish bar... to garnish your tacos.  Salsa is behind the counter where you pay so you have to ask for it.   Definitely a must do when in Las Vegas! The only other place you can experience Tacos El Gordo is in Tijuana.
Bomb tacos!! Better than the ones I used to eat while living in Tijuana!!  Adobada with pineapple was delicious with lots of flavor!
Very frustrating ordering process (check out signs and lines......gotta get in the right line for different types of meats, fries, drinks).  Weird.  But awesome food.  Wow, and I know real mexican taste and this is it.  Well worth the effort to get your order places and paid for.  Will go back, for sure!
Two Words: Adobadas Mulas.  Pricier than the other tacos but my goodness, it tastes like nothing you'll find at any Mexican restaurant.  We've been to restaurants in Mexico, San Diego, Texas, etc.  that don't offer food as tasty as Tacos El Gordo's Adobadas Mulas.  If you are into healthy eating, don't order this but if you want to indulge, stand in the Mulas line first.  The Tripas tacos is also great if you like offal like I do.  Tried the Cabeza but was mild tasting compared to the Mulas and Tripas.  After we finished eating, saw another customer with a large grilled green pepper and green onions and read later it is free but not on the menu so you have to ask for it.  Definitley returning when in Vegas.
Taste: 4. Creativity/Authenticity: 3. Atmosphere: 2.5. Service: 2.5. Bang for your buck: 3. . Now best tacos in vegas very bold statement but as of right now best tacos I've had in vegas. Came here cause it was cinco de mayo!!!! and well I love beef and all but where are the fish and chicken tacos man??!! came with the wife and well i had a bad night after that cause she wanted to eat something a little less beef tongue and stomach haha. I love LENGUA if i could eat it everyday i would but the lengua tacos and the asada OMG fucking amazaballs!!!!! the beef shoulder not so much very salty. Service here well think its cause im not hispanic or of any hispanic back ground so the language barrier was def a factor but the set up here is def weird was in one line for asada than they told me to go to another line for asada?! i know each line has separate meats but i was in the right line!!! anyways love the tacos but hate the eating setup outside in vegas when its summer are you kidding??!! yeah i dont think so on the plus side i saw little john there yeah!!! overall this place is good the best so far but i am on the look out for more hidden local spots acutally my local friends told me about this spot so
their taco al pastor of choice is abodaba, if you want good authentic tacos in vegas, this is probably your only way to go, it's not bad, it's amazing, it's the best thing ever, it over shadows that lengua (tongue) taco that i got by miles...i can see why they need two separate lines for it and i still had to wait over 20mins cuz some ppl in front of me just ordered like 20tacos . . they have horchata soft drink machine ;d
My one regret from living in San Diego is that I didn't go to the original Tacos El Gordo in Chula Vista more than once in the three and a half years that I lived there.  Seriously, what I did was practically a crime against humanity.  Because as I mentioned in that review, you're not going to get better tacos anywhere other than Mexico itself.  So when I realized the Gordo opened in Vegas...of course I didn't bother going here either until now LOL.  Yeah, I should just quit on life.. . Same deal as the original.  Different meats at different stations, line up and go get some.  If you come here and don't get the adobada, you might as well just get back in your car and drive away.  This adobada is easily some of the best in the world and is the #1 reason to even come here.  Carne asada was just ok in my book, but at least it was prepared with the proper ingredients (aka HELLA GUACAMOLE), so it gets a passing grade in my book.. . And since I figured I needed to make up for not coming here who knows how many times, I came for the tacos before going to XS and came for the super fries after going to XS.  Because quite frankly, nothing beats drunk food like drunk Mexican food.  And nothing beats drunk Mexican food like super fries topped with carne asada, adobada, cheese, and guacamole!. . I think I have an excuse to go to XS a lot more now.  When the joint is across the street from Encore Las Vegas, there's really not much choice.  Secret Pizza, you have met your post-clubbing food match!
A friend suggested Tacos El Gordo when I mentioned Las Vegas so I came on yelp to check out the reviews. I read that the wait was crazy long. We were here the first week of May and not sure if this is a slow month for Vegas in general but we walked right into Tacos El Gordo and there wasn't a line- both times we went. It was great! I was expecting at least a 20 min wait. I love lengua in general so of course that's what I ordered and it was delicious. My husband ordered carne Asada and he loved it. We came back again for lunch the next day. I would eat here everyday if I could. Don't forget the horchata drink for just $1.50!
Delicious and cheap open till 5 am yum we went everyday in Vegas it had a bit of a line but it goes fast the food is great yum
In an ideal world, this is how it supposed to work out: . . Wait in line for few minutes, order tacos as one order, pay at the cashier, and enjoy delicious tacos.. . So much for the ideal world .... . Once you walk in, you will see separate lines for different types of taco (two lines for adobada, two lines for asada, one line for fries, and ..... ONE line for beef tongue / tripe / beef shoulder). . . So I lined up and waited to get one beef tongue taco and one beef shoulder. So I waited ... and waited ... and waited .... . Why did it take so long? Oh I see, everyone was ordering at least 10+ tacos for each order. Taco El Gordo, how can you only have one line for beef tongue / should line? Anyhow, and so I waited for 30+ minutes ... . . Finally it got to my turn! And guess what? THEY RAN OUT OF BEEF SHOULDER -_-! Dude, not cool at all. I only ordered beef tongue and beef tripe tacos. . . In the end, I basically did not want to wait in another line and I just simply overpaid for a $10 carne asada fries because there was no line. Oh, did I also mention it took them another 10 minutes just to get the fries out?  . . Well, these tacos better be amazing right?. . tacos de lengua (beef tongue - $2.25 each) and tacos de tripa (beef tripe - $2 each): For $2 tacos, they tasted okay. Is it worth 30 minutes wait? Hell no!  . . Taco de adobada (spicy pork - $2): Probably the best taco out of all three that I've ordered, but it wasn't crazily good. . . Carne asada fries ($10): Not like it was awful, just not at the price that I paid for. I still can't believe I paid $10 for somewhat average fries ($5 would be a better price). . . I will stick with my East LA tacos ... they are still the bomb and my ultimate taco standards.
There street tacos are super good. I could eat like 6-8 though before I am full! So they add up price wise. Really good al pastor! Right up there with taco y taco as the best two Mexican joints around.
Nothing beats their Carne Asada Fries and their Abodaba (spicy pork) tacos. Its pretty cool to see the Abodaba chef strip the pork from the hanging meat thing. They work pretty damn fast too. Grab a tortilla, strip the meat onto the tortilla, put some lettuce, add some sauce. BAM. Repeat.. . The one thing that threw me off here was that there were so many lines for different things. Whoever organized this.. didn't organize this. Theres a line for Asada. Theres a line for Abodaba. Theres a line for fries. Theres a line for beef tongue/tripe/shoulder. And... once you thought that was all done theres a line for the cashier. If I came here drunk/hungover I would not have the capacity/patience to take this all in. Which is probably some of the customers, since this is Las Vegas.
Despite having been to Vegas at least 100 times, I never made my way to Tacos El Gordo until just recently. It's located in a strip mall about a 5 minute walk past Encore on the strip. The tacos are $2.00 and the carne asada fries are $10.00. Portions are pretty good - don't expect anything too fancy. There's limited seating inside but plenty of tables outside. The way it works is you go to the corresponding booth for what you want to order, put it all on a tray, and then pay after. Food is pretty good but I had a terrible experience.. . One downside to this place is that it may or may not have gotten me food poisoning. Considering there's close to 1000 reviews on this place, I may have just been an oddball but I was in a sweaty, chilly pain a few hours after eating here praying all night long to the porcelain god in the hotel and vomiting 16x. Since this was the first thing I had in Vegas, I subsequently didn't get to indulge myself in any other food or alcohol for the remainder of the trip. . . You've been warned.
This is one of those places that I like to stop by right after I get to veags when I'm not in the mood yet to start partying or going to a nice restaurant.. . very cheap and quick food, that tastes pretty damn good as well! lines can get a bit long but they move fast, outdoor and indoor seating, parking lot faces encore/wynn
I love this place so much! There meat are just juicy. The price is defiantly worth it, I crave this every month, and is defiantly a place I would bring my family and friends to try out when then come from out of town! The restaurant seem just like no other Mexican restaurants , when you first walk in, everything just seem simple, nothing special for first impression, but once you got those tacos on your hand, everything about the restaurant don't matter, the food are just great, I went there for lunch time today and bought some Togo for my sons snack ! I defiantly recommend tacos lover to try out this place, just right near the strip!
I went through 3 different emotions from the moment I placed my order to when I received my order. First I saw the prices. $2 tacos, $4 burritos, $10 for combos. Yay, cheap food!!  So I ordered one beef taco for $2 and one beef burrito for $4. Next I saw the portion. The burrito wasn't a "burrito" I am used to eating. So I was a little confused. And I thought the portion was so small. Once again, not what I am used to. So sadness came over me. I sat down to eat my meal. OMG, these people know how to make tasty Mexican food! Pure joy and happiness began to take over any past emotions. The food was very tasty. And it turned out the portion wasn't small at all. I got full on just those two orders. The point is, this place is awesome! Sooo good! 4 stars instead of 5 because they don't give you utensils when dining in. I literally sat down and had to get up again to find the forks. And it was so crowded in there, getting the fork wasn't easy. I saw that most people were eating with their hands. But they should offer utensils during when the customer is up at the register paying for their meal. I don't mind eating with my hand but when I've been sightseeing all day, I know I do not want to touch my food with my dirty hands. Hence why they need to automatically offer utensils rather than assuming the customer will locate the utensils and take one.
My apologies to every taqueria I hold near and dear to my heart...this place is hands down the best I have ever been to.  Our office goes to Vegas a couple times a year and we all CRAVE Gordos.  Cabeza tacos are my favorite but there is one thing so ridiculously good that we never see even in California...mulas.  For God's sake make sure you get mulas, they are heaven and you'll be hard pressed to find them anywhere else.  Go here and make it part of your Vegas experience, be sure to thank me later...
Great tasting tacos al pastor, tripas and asada a lil.pricey but gotta be realistic there on the strip will be back next time im in town...
If you like pubic hair in your Sauce go ahead And eat here. All these reviews are not accurate these tacos are not the best. The place looked really dirty and the cashier lady was rude when helping costumers! BAD SERVICE. If I could give 0 stars I would
Delicious Adobada Tacos and asada/Adobada fries. Crowded, order first then Pay. Find a seat if you can.
Late night eats for cheap. Tacos, tacos and more tacos really help soak up all that drinking you've probably been having. The carne asada fries are delicious and I'm not sure why this hasn't caught on here in NY.. . You just get so much bang for buck and after spending for all that booze and gambling, this is a much welcome reprieve from it all. It's a dessert oasis here, offering sustenance and a break from walking all over.
Best. Drunchies. Ever. . . Came here after a great night at XS, love how its located right next to Wynn!. The lines do get pretty long, i mean, cheap delicious food after a night of dancing is a must!. . All their tacos are great! esp. carne asada!! Juicy and tender, I love how they cook it right then and there so you know its fresh! You can also ask for grilled veggies! Don't forget to ask for their hot sauces when you're ordering because they don't have a hot sauce bar. . Their sopas are also superrr good. Would really recommend it!. BTW, there are different lines for different kinds of meat, and dishes so make sure to stand in the right line!
Was so glad to see this next to my Hotel Encore! The Al Pastor Tacos hit the spot 3 am in the morning .  We back the next day and this time had one person on another line getting different tacos .  They need to figure another system. U can wait A LONG TIME just to get one type of taco.  Different lines different meat.. Very inconvenient.
I love how they make their own tortilla  and their meet is all soo fresh and juicy.   . . I cannot believe I have yet write a review for this place!. This place is unforgettable; from the long lines to cooking in front of customers, they are as good as it gets! I've eaten numerous Mexican Foods in Arizona; but to me, nothing is ever comparable to them. Every time I go back to Vegas, I have to at least get a horchata there.  Okay, that's a lie! I have to get at least one taco...no, make that two!!. I totally recommend the Adobada (spicy pork) Fries because not only is the line shorter, but....it is roasted on a metal rod!! All their meets are cooked to perfection in front of everyone; that way, they have to stay even if it's a long line. . Their workers are pretty nice; I've heard they are actually from main Mexico so their techniques are directly from there. This explains why they are so authentic, at least in my opinion. . I get so excited for places that are super delicious and this place is definitely worth the lost of water coming running out of my mouth. *drools!*
This place was suggested to me by one of the hotel staff.  Boy was it delicious and very affordable!  I had lenga, al pastor and sudaro tacos.  Meat was tender and very tasty!  Service was fast and prices affordable!  If your in Vegas you have to try the tacos!
The worst taco I ever had in life. This place is so dirty!! The service is horrendous : different lines for different items. You get your food first and then you pay. Some people just walk out without paying. Kind of hard to tell who pays and who doesn't because it's so packed with drunks and smelly musty people inside. The lines are out of order--- not worth the wait and $$$. I came back into the room with my friends asking why I reek like onions--- damn you el gordo nasty crap taco!!!!
i'll admit, my expectations were rather low.  everyone kept raving, and i was like "whatevers, it's just tacos".  and "my gawd wtf is up with this line!" "do we REALLY need to wait here and eat this... we can get mexican food anywhere".  . and then.... the adobada happened, and my mouth was way too full of deliciousness to whine any more.. . there are 4 lines you can order from.  each line is designated for specific items, so if you want the adobada and you're standing in the carne asada line, you're shit out of luck.  better go to the back of the line, pronto!. . we ordered 4 adobada tacos, 4 carne asada tacos, 1 carne asada sope, and a bowl full of chilis and all that jazz.  for all 9 items and a horchata (self serve) our bill was 23 bucks.  upon receiving all our food i really thought we were in over our heads and had ordered way too much... but we finished every single bite... and was left wanting more.. . the carne asada was nothing special.  in fact, i've had better.  king taco's asada trumps el gordo any day.  but man, oh man, the adobada... the green sauce.  mind blown.  was so delicious.  . . they have another tacos el gordo in chula vista, but none close enough to OC.  definitely will be going out of my way to get more hopefully soon..
Once I got over my shock that they didn't have chicken, I was ready to order!!  I picked the Mexican Shwarma ( as another Yelper called the pork).  So glad I did.  It was delicious.  Not spicy( I got the sauce on the side) and very moist.  The corn tortillas had the perfect corny tasty to them.  I only wish I would have discovered this joint sooner.  My wife waited on a different line and got the carne asada taco.  She thought they were really tasty too.  As good or better than a taco in Socal.
Despite difficulty locating this place (don't use the monorail system, you won't get very close!), we drove to it because we had heard of its greatness. It has good parking and really isn't that hard to find once you know to drive, and it was well worth it. . . The tacos are not big, but they pack more authentic flavor than any Mexican restaurant I have been to so far. I got two taco adobadas, a taco tripa, and a taco asada. They had some good horchata in a fountain with some soda as well. . . Needless to say I am impressed. Two dollars a taco. Super quick, friendly people, clean but fun tidy environment, and incredible food. Only drawback was walking back outside into the 100 degree heat. . . If you visit Vegas, you must stop by Tacos el Gordo!
This place has the best adobada tacos!!! . The flavors of the meat and the delicious green sauce that they have over them is to die for!  You gotta try them, you'll be back for more!!
I was really skeptical when people were telling me that these we're the best tacos they've ever eaten.  I have had some of the best tacos all over California and these are hands down the best pork adobada tacos period.  . . Our group also ordered carne asada quesadillas and asada fries.  The "quesadilla" comes out as a 3" round?  It was odd size and small but tasted delicious nonetheless.  Their carne asada fries, tasted fine and the portion was huge.  But the star of the day was the adobabda tacos.. . It's a great spot for lunch or for a late night eat after a bar or club.  It is within walking distance from Encore/Wynn.  Be careful if you want multiple items from the menu.  There are different lines for the multiple items offered so be prepared to wait in multiple ones especially if there is a wait.
Came here cuz of the fantastic reviews on Yelp. I was sorely disappointed. There is no AC and its super hot and sweaty in here, that already diminished the dining experience. The meat slowly spins over a small fire and looks fantastic when the guy cuts it fresh on to your taco for you. Thats about where all the frills end, the meat tastes just OK. The sauce is refreshing and a nice complement, but overall everything was just.... meh. I'm glad I only had to wait 5 minutes or so in line.
My current favorite taco place on planet earth.. . There's something about a finely crafted taco. All of their meat is hot and delicious. It comes straight from the grill onto your plate, so you know that it's good. The carne asada has this smoky flavor that is so unlike anything else I've ever had. Tacos Al Pastor are my hands down favorite and you need to get them with everything on top, including the pineapple which sits at the top of the spit. You'll want to make sure that you get some grilled onions and peppers to complete the experience. If there's a line, get in it as soon as you can because this place is worth the wait, and the drive.
This place is weird....there are 4 lines for different meats. If you want a lengua taco wait in the lengua line...if you want Assad go wait in the Assad line. The men who prepare the food talk to you like you're special needs. They're so rude and they don't understand how confusing their entire set up is. It was so loud in there with one man butchering crane Assad that was full of fat...I couldn't hear the man asking me questions all the while he was behind the counter rolling his eyes at me. I understand people come in there drunk however all your patrons aren't drunk and I clearly wasn't. I wanted to throw the below average and expensive taco in his face. The place is cramped, dirty and the tacos are $2.00....in LA the most we pay for an incredible taco is $1.50.....I don't even pay that when I go to tacos Leo or chato. Some yelpers have nasty taste buds or something. Don't believe the hype for this place or earl of sandwich.....gross!!!!
I would say this place would of been great if their tortillas weren't so rock hard, dry with razor sharp edges and if they offered hot sauces or fresh salsas. I'm way too much of a sauce snob and I admit it. I was very disappointed that there was no salsa bar or sauce for that matter. The tacos could of used a nice dollop of moist and flavorful salsa.. . Granted the carne asada (beef) and the adobada (pork) were marinated well and very tender, I needed a spicy kick in my life! Even the grilled jalapeno pepper they offered us wasn't spicy. . . I favored the adobada over the carne asada, it seemed more tender. Also, the taco de cabeza (head) was really oily, we took a bite and couldn't eat the rest.. . The vampiro, had a sopes masa cake bottom and a crispy fried tortilla tostada-like top. It was filled with carne asada (or any meat you choose), a dense piece of rubber-like cheese, and topped with lots of their guacamole sauce and cilantro and onions. It was tasty, hard to eat, and extremely filling! . . Their avocado sauce that they put on everything tasted good, but it was very thick and filling. It's not made of 100% avocados and they may of added some type of filler in it. . . Make sure to ask for a complimentary plate of grilled green onion and peppers, they don't offer it unless you ask for it.. . 6 small tacos, 2 vampiros, and a soda totals $23.02
This is the Northern branch of TEG de Tijuana, B.C.  I caught the Strip bus up from my convention at The Sands for lunch, and was glad I came!  TEG is just past the edge of  'Turisto Vegas' and firmly planted in the 'Residents' Vega's (all the surrounding store-fronts seem to Hispanic, or Korean, or Lebanese- oriented.).  If you love tacos, then this place is for you.  A little confusing at first, there were snaking lines of Mexicans and Haole all queued up inside the door, for different ordering stations, where incredibly speedy preparers hammer out the variety meats for the tacos and tostadas. After you pick up your order, you take your tray, pay the cashier lady at the front door, and then take your tray outside to a canvas & mylar tent, and grab a seat on a picnic-style bench.  I skipped the more authentic organ-based lines (tripas, cabezas, sesas, etc.) and  just went for an assortment of tacos in my comfort zone: carne asada; lengua; chorizo; adobada.   All were hot, a little greasy, and served on these great little thick, 4" diameter Masa tortillas, with lime wedges, and nice crunchy radishes.  Delicioso!   I'd probably give the place  5 ***** -- if they could only serve a nice, cold beer ( I settled for an icy can of Coke, which was a good choice for the chiles!)  Skip the flan, which is the standard Industrial article, a thick gluey disc that is squirted into those little plastic cups. .  After eating, it is a short walk back South to the Wynn Hotel complex, where you can enjoy wandering around the waterfall park complex, and watching all the rich folks do their thang before heading back to the heart of the Strip.
Authentic street tacos with tons of meat options from the standard carnitas to organ meats like brain. The spicy pork was amazing and the best taco I've ever had. This is a quick service operation where you line up in front of the station that is serving your taco of choice then you pay at the register. Additional condiments to are available near the drink stand. The sodas include horchata and cream sodas. We were there around 2am on a Monday and the line was very reasonable at about 10 minutes for both the tacos and register. They have plenty of seating options both indoors and outside. The location sits at the top of the strip just north of the Wynn and walking distance from Circus Circus and Rivera.
Different lines different meats but worth the wait...al pastor tacos are some of the best I've had in a long time
