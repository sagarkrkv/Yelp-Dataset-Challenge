I've stayed at the Wynn a few times in the past but it's been a few years since I had the opportunity to return. We got a great deal set up for our Vegas vacation this year and we booked one of the king sized rooms with panoramic view. . . The Wynn is a pretty amazing hotel! Our view overlooking the strip was beautiful, our room amazing (omg I love the sheets), and bathroom was just as amazing as I remembered it (large, two sinks, separated watercloset, *HUGE* tub). The service is great and we were well taken care of.. . Two of the things I love about the Wynn: the pool/resort area (those pools are beautiful); and the mojitos with a sugar cane stick! I was able to take advantage of both and we were treated to a very interesting (and strange!) music show/display at the waterfall area. We also visited two restaurants in the Wynn (The Buffet, which I've attended before, and Red 8). . . I would happily stay at the Wynn again, it's one of the more enjoyable and nicer hotels along the strip. One of the only drawbacks is it's located at the far end of the strip. There's a mall across the street from the hotel with quite a few stores for shopping, as well as some corner store options, but I didn't manage to locate a drugstore in there (not saying there isn't one, I just didn't look very hard to locate one).
The room was great the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the slow service...   Room service..  Extra pillow.  All took way too long.    LOVE this hotel though!!! One of the best!!!!!
Very nice classy Hotel/ Casino Resort. . Won the most here I've ever won at any casino.. 9 out of 10 Vegas Cabbies recommended this place. . . Great drinks, fast service. Somewhat of a higher minimum on tables than most places ($25). Maybe that was just because it was the weekend though.. . Had dinner at the luxurious SW Steakhouse, sat outside on their terrace and enjoyed a water show about every 15mins. . . Food was delicious, presented perfectly and again service all around was nice! Had a great time. This place is on my the top of my list anytime I visit Vegas!
Stayed here recently for a business trip. I live locally while the rest of my company is in CA, so it wasn't much of a "trip". But staying at theWynn made it feel like a real vacation! The rooms are beautiful, especially if you can get the golf course view. The amenities are great, service was excellent. . . My favorite part about the hotel was the bed! Most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept on. . . I didn't gamble at the Wynn, so can't comment on the casino. If you can afford it, it's definitely worth staying here!
It's so beeeeyooootiful! I loved it here (and I really, really liked the sheer lotus curtains in our room) and loved how it was close enough to xs to just walk indoors there, but far away enough so you didn't have to hear all the noise if you didn't want to.
The Wynn is by far one of the most beautiful hotels in Las Vegas. It's very grand and makes you feel like a King or a Queen. This was our first time to stay here and we enjoyed the room and the level of service provided the entire stay. They work to make you feel really special.. . The casino is not that crowded so it's easy to find a slot machine or table to gamble. We tried a few of their amazing restaurants and were pleased with all of them. Everywhere you look there is beautiful, fresh flowers. It's absolutely breath taking!! . . I visited the spa and was amazed by how beautiful it was. It felt very European. Their services are first class and absolutely one of the best massages I have ever received. I highly recommend the spa and hotel. . . The pool area was not my favorite. It's not that big and it felt crowded and the food and drink service was lacking for such a nice hotel. . . Overall I feel like the entire experience was really good. I just don't know that it was totally worth the extra money it takes to stay here. We have stayed in other hotels that are less expensive and have enjoyed them just as well. Needless to say we did have a great time!
Just lovely...if you are a local or visitor go check out the flowers in the lobby and other areas. He does an amazing job with these. Great rooms, restaurants, and other amenities.
Wynn Sweet Wynn...Personally, I feel It's the only way to do Las Vegas right. Your one stop destination that offers only the best of Vegas (Luxury, gaming, entertainment, dining, day pools, spa treatments, nightlife and beautiful people.). . . It's worth the splurge every now and then. If you're on a budget, join their Red Card membership and take advantage of their frequent specials. Weeknights are affordable. Weekends rates are definitely eye openers, if you're not a so called "baller", but if you book smart online it's attainable. . . This world class hotel sets the bar by far and will lead you to wanting more of that Steve Wynn experience.
Sexy people everywhere
This hotel isn't a good place for someone who doesn'tdrink or gamble, it's confusing and it was difficult trying to get our bags up to our rooms or to find the check in counters from the self park. The rooms were large and comfortable,  the view was of the car park so was pretty crappy, you can't use the fridge to keep any drinks cool as they will charge you if you do (I guess they want to encourage their customers to use the bars). The resort fee is a ripoff we didn't even use the pool because it closes so early so $75 for 3 days of internet (an hour a day of actual use) is a joke.. . The hotel seems to care more about it's encore and casino guests rather than the wynn guests. Service is not great and the buffet breakfast is of low quality (more about variety), not worth it, save your money and go to a cafe outside the hotel.. . We wanted to use the bathtub on the last night but when we filled it we noticed gross things floating on top like body hair and fluff! So disgusting and when I  told the reception at check out he just said sorry, not good enough for a $300 a night room! Educate your staff to deal with issues better. I didn't enjoy my stay and I'll warn anyone against it, so hyped up over nothing. Maybe it's enjoyable if you are drunk or have never stayed in a nice hotel before.
We went to this hotel just for the brunch because we stayed in a different hotel, which was, unfortunately, not the best.  I would like to commend the people here for a job well done.  I thought my wallet was stolen somewhere when we were shopping but it was found by someone in this hotel.  He could be anybody, a guest or an employee there.  But whoever he is, God bless his heart.  . The service here is so great and employees are well dressed.  Thank you for your great help.
Come check out the show La Reve! It was cool. I would definitely come back and watch it again.
Stayed here once when I went to Vegas with my bf the first time. . . The room is superb.. nice bed, huge window with strip view, iPad/iPhone speakers (not for recently models though), spacious bathroom... . . It's the best.
The Wynn is a true high end hotel and casino. Built where the old Desert Inn used to be, they still have the golf course, it and it's sister property the Encore  make up a high end vacation destination.. . They have several bars and restaurants off the casino floor and an awesome buffet.. . This is a full amenity resort with a great show, wonderful spa, and golf course.. . My favorite place to stay.
my family stayed here for a business trip may 12-16.  wow is worth 5 stars!   when we finally made it to self parking we had no problem making our way to the registration desk.  why?  i'm sure we looked lost and the wynn employees with purple jackets were more than helpful.  they directed us to the front desk.  amazing!. . the staff at the front desk were amazing.  i loved the service.  my only issue was deciding on not paying $15 per entry for the fitness center.  i ran up and down the strip every morning at 5 am for free.. . the room was amazing!  it was almost too nice for a family with 2 young boys to stay in.  lol.  the room was amazing.  the huge window view of the strip was amazing.  the bed was probably the best part of my business trip!  i loved how with a push of 1 button we were able to turn everything on or off.. . the restaurant choices in the wynn was amazing.  we are able to enjoy the buffet too.  . . we don't gamble and even if we did we probably couldn't afford the minimums at the tables.  lol.  we lost our car keys and had no trouble being directed to the lost & found and we retrieved our keys.. . the pool was amazing for the family.  and for your information european  sunbathing is available at the wynn.  lol.. . the wynn is probably not the best place to take the family with small kids.  i'm sure there are far better options for young families.
