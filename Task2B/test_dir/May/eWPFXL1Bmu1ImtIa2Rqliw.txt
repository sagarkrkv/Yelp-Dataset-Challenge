I enjoyed my stay here, very nice room. Has everything you want all in one spot.
The hotel is nice. It's gigantic. . The rooms are great. Recently done over and good sized.. There are great restaurants inside, I've never seen the shows there but have heard  good things. . The pool is awesome. Great area. Huge with a large lazy river and several other pools. . . Down side is the casino smells like smoke more than some of the newer spots. It's a great party hotel, awesome for a bachelor party more than a romantic weekend. But overall, a great spot.
TOP HOTEL. Wir waren das erste Mal im MGM -  letztes Jahr im Ceasars und ich muss sagen das MGM steht dem in nichts nach. Preislich ist das MGM etwas hoher aber die Zimmer (neu renoviert) sind deutlich besser. TIPP: Falls mal der TV ausfallt nach 2 Sekunden Bild ist der TV schwarz - einfach unter dem Schrank die Microsoft Box mal killen (vom Strom nehmen) damit war das Problem komplett erledigt.. . Die Lage des MGM ist am sudlichen Ende des Strips aber direkt aus dem Hotel fahrt die Monorail damit erreicht man den kompletten Strip die Mitte in ca. 2 Minuten fahrt. . . Super Pool Anlage, der Lazy River ist nett, Riesige auswahl an Spieltischen und Automaten.. . Ich wurde auf jeden Fall wieder dieses Hotel buchen!
10-508 suit. The MOST uncomfortable bathroom/WC that I've ever seen!! The "view" is disappointing too. Don't take it.
I stayed here during my first visit to Vegas. We picked this place based on a referral from a friend. Our view from the room was not that great since we saw the roof next door; but the mountains could be seen in the background! . . There were tons of notable restaurants inside like Top Chef's Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak, Emeril's Seafood & Creole Cooking and many more. . . Of course they have the buffets, restaurants for a quick bite, clubs, lounges, casinos and other attractions.. . All in all, I slept well, the room was clean, the concierge desk was helpful and they had a shuttle that took you to and from the airport.
This has become the hip hop hotel on the strip. If you're into that you'll love it here, otherwise stay away. I had dinner at Hecha en Las Vegas. That was about the worst Mexican I ever had. Rooms were nice, pools were fine, not too crowded. . . It seems MGM is trying to brand itself toward a younger, high energy, party crowd. So there is constant loud tween music in elevators, casino floor and pool area. The clientele have become a bit more low class.. . Not to mention the stampede after an alleged shooting right after the Mayweather fight.
This isn't the greatest of Las Vegas hotels but it isn't the worst.  It's a nice end of the strip location easy to get in and out of and also held the annual ACM awards which is why I was here at the casino to begin with.  Really enjoyed all the festivities around that weekend!
Stayed here for a couple of nights last week and was very disappointed. This place is an suppose to be an icon on the Las Vegas strip however its more like the icon that was. My concers are:. . 1. Check in:. Its a 45+ minute wait to check in regardless of when you arrive. Lines are 3 deep. Once I got to the front I walked over to the open teller and expected welcome to Las Vegas sorry about the long wait. Instead he started with you are suppose to wait till you are called. Nice welcome!. . 2. Smoke:.  The smoke in the casino area is so strong that 4 in our party started to get ichy eyes and throats the second day. You cant avoid it since you have to go through the casino to get to the resturants and conference center, pool etc. We played on the tables and then went looking for a better casino. . . 3. Pool:. Sat by the lazy river pool and around 2 pm decided to order food. Asked the waitress if we could and she said she cannot take food orders only drinks. Went to the pool side resturant and was told they were closed for lunch. (at 2 pm mind you) Was directed to a food take away bar and tried ordering food however to order food you have to have a photo id with you. You dont need said photo id to order drinks 2 feet away from this bar. Our bar tab was over a hundred but we cannot get a $14  burger without id even though I am staying in the hotel and have a room key on me. . . Decided to try out the lazy river and it jam packed with people standing in it. So as your tube goes by they make it a game to push you around. Not very fun. . . Overall this hotel seems unequipped to handle the number of rooms it has and its staff is crumbling. There are way better hotels and casinos to visit in the area. Stay far away.
MGM is actually a very nice hotel and one of my favorites when I come to vegas. All the rooms are great, lots of tables and the pool is amazing. There is even a lazy river. Definitely recommend when visiting vegas.
My friends and I do a big annual trip to Vegas, booking multiple rooms at a time. We figured we'd give MGM a shot since they just had their grand renovations. And I have to admit I'm disappointed. . . The rooms were pretty standard. Nothing grand about them. The only two "luxurious" things about the room were the black out blinds and marble in the bathroom. . . The door to our room wouldn't even lock behind us! I've never been in a hotel where you have to push the door so it latches, so I'm not sure if the hinges just aren't as powerful as they should be. . . We could also hear our next door neighbor blow drying their hair, and we thought it was coming from our room. That's how close they were. Several times we would hear someone knocking on a door, opening or closing a door, and it sounded like it was our door again. Not to mention the hallways are FREEZING cold! . . I've heard people talk about how awesome the lazy river is here, but honestly it was disgusting. The water was so dirty that my group and I only made one lap around the river and jumped out. Never to return to the pool again. . . I'll personally never return to the MGM as a guest again and will certainly not book our annual group event there either. Totally disappointed, I had very high hopes for the MGM Grand.
Definitely the bench mark in Vegas.. . Vegas' largest hotel can cause you to become slightly lost within it's friendly confines. My girlfriend and I were no different. And on that hot Tuesday night we were feeling parched. . . In true Vegas fashion.. a bartender when asked if we could have a glass of water, instead offered to fill our keeper glass that my girlfriend had from the Rio with ice and water for us.. . I wish I remembered his name, but he was a God send.. . MGM is a clean, huge, beautiful hotel with plenty to offer guest and visitor alike.
I lost my car keys at MGM...and I cannot express enough how helpful and absolutely wonderful the Lost & Found staff were as well as security.  They comforted me when I was an absolute wreck, and were such a support as I was panicking.  They were completely professional but also very compassionate and so willing to go out of their way to help.  Security Officer Marcus Morrison was the best help I could ask for.  He did everything he could for me and seriously gave me the best service I've ever had at any hotel.  They ultimately found my keys the next day and Officer Morrison was able to give them to me himself.  I was so thrilled...not just with the find but with the overall experience and how the staff especially Officer Morrison treated me and my situation.  . Officer Walker in Security also was such an incredible help to me and truly assisted me with such professionalism and a genuine will to help me out.  . I live in Vegas...but if I were to use a hotel I would pick MGM just based on how gracious the staff was to me.  I am truly thankful.  THANK YOU Officer Morrison, Officer Walker, and staff!!
I come to Vegas a lot and I've stayed at many different resorts. MGM has been by far one of my favorites. The location isn't the best, personally, but it is a very nice hotel. . . Checking in went fairly fast. We had made a reservation for 4 people. The receptionist was very nice. Not once did she mention what kind of room we were in. I figured we would get 2 beds since the reservation was for 4 people. We walk up to the room and one of the keys didn't work. I've had this happen to me at the Flamingo and it was a nightmare. The other key worked and we walked in the room to find that they gave us a King bed. How the hell are 4 girls supposed to fit in one bed? I called downstairs and they said they could do nothing about it. At this point I was furious as they wouldn't even give us a roll away bed because they don't have any. . . Later that night we were crammed and irritated. I went down and spoke to a very nice gentleman who was a night manager. He was understanding that I demanded another room. He moved us to a 2 queen bed room. Seriously if it wasn't for that manager I would be writing a 1 star review. . . The room was pretty nice and really clean. It was also really spacious and had plenty of room for 4 girls to get ready. The resort is beautiful. I'd recommend this place overall just make sure you know what type of room you're getting  before you drag your stuff up to the room.
My first trip to vegas, we stayed here in the west wing rooms, they were gorgeous, quiet and clean. The hotel is huge, but very easy to navigate, and the west wing provides quick and easy strip access while bypassing the casino. this end of the strip is less heavily trafficked so it's a great spot to get a bit away from the crowds after hours of dealing with them further down the strip.. . The food court and shops are convenient. The pool area is huge and lush. The staff are friendly and very accommodating. This is more a mid-priced hotel, and my only complaint is the rose air freshener they pump into the lobby, it smells like old lady perfume.
Just so you know - I have stayed at the MGM at least 10 trips and have found it to be a 3-4 star experience.  This last trip was different and not good. They put me in the WEST TOWER and it was terrible - tiny room, bad lighting, bathroom mirror build in light was blinding, safe was locked in the open position (unusable) lounge chair had large rip in seat fabric. Stayed 4/6 thru 4/10 during a convention. . However - the rest of the hotel is great, great restaurants and best of all - they have a direct MonoRail station at the MGM.  Stay at the MGM - just don't allow them to put you in the "WEST TOWER".
I'm coming back don't worry. Trip was planned out for Fresno, but I had the option of a 4 hour layover in Vegas and took advantage of it by putting $100 on black and winning a horse race (thanks Lindy!!) I can't WAIT to come back to Vegas!!!!!!!! #letsgetit
Keep in mind, that hectic things make me nervous, but the MGM was nice.  I didn't mind the ridiculous amount of people packed in here.  They had everything available, slots, blackjack, what ever you can think of.  Ventilation is pretty good too, and there is a Starbucks.. . I just love how the building is designed inside, and out.
I may be partially bias in this review because I stayed here during the World Championship Rodeo, so you may want to take that into account a bit. . This place is uh-mazing!!! There are a plethora of restaurants, entertainment options, and so much more here! You can even go watch TV shows and get paid for it! HAKKASAN is the bomb.com here as well! That was probably the best night club in vegas willing that Pure was not having a party or famous DJ there. I will definitely stay here again! I used to stay at the Cosmopolitan, mainly because of past referrals, but MGM knocks the Cosmo out of the water for a far less price! If you want more relaxation go to the Cosmo, but MGM is where the party is!
The lines to check-in was long and it was 20min wait to get the room. I stayed at executive queen suite on Mother's Day. The room is like a suite w/ living room and includes sofa bed. It's very nice and updated suite. The bathroom had a shower and tub w/ shower faucet kinda weird and 2 double sinks. Its a nice size bathroom. Our view was the rooftop. The queen beds were kinda soft. The best thing about the room is the wifi. Also, our room was a short walk to elevator. The casino floor looks different since they got rid of lions den (now a sports bar), less slots and tables, Starbucks in middle of floor, redo of food court, added hakkasan club. It's across from New York casino and Tropicana. The self parking is long from parking to reservation desk. Otherwise, I had a nice pleasant stay at MGM Grand.
Hello,. . My husband and I recently stayed at the MGM Grand, we had a wonderful time while we were here. The only thing that was disappointing was the shock when we checked in that we would be temporarily charged $200 just in case we trashed our hotel room. We understand why you have to do this, if we would have known this was going to to happen we would have been more prepared. Because of this hidden cost we had $200 less to spend on our vacation. I asked why we were not told about this fee the man replied "because you booked through a third party." This is very inconvenient and upsetting. Because of this we would think twice before booking here again.
Hotel and staff very nice.. Bartenders. ..need to be friendlier maybe.. . Casino is always clean.. Not very smokey. . Pastry place is so good with very friendly :). . I want to always stay here when I come to Vegas.
We come to Vegas every year for my Birthday. This year we decided to stay at the MGM Grand. The reviews were pretty good, as I understood it was one of the newer and nicer hotels on the strip, and I was also excited to check out Hakkasan night club, since I knew Tiesto was the resident DJ there. We arrived on a Wednesday around 3pm. Check-in line was about 10 mins, which is not unreasonable at a large hotel. The guy who checked us in was polite but notwhat I would call friendly. I mentioned we were celebrating my birthday which didn't get any reaction out of him, not that it's a big deal I mean it's MY birthday so I'm the one that gets to be excited. We booked a pretty basic room in the west wing tower. The room was comfortable, very average. Lighting was dim in the room but great in the bathroom. We did have automated blinds and a huge window that provided plenty of natural light, yet there were windows of the other rooms close by which eliminated privacy with open blinds. The mattress was not uncomfortable, but did give me shoulder pain for 3 days after we left. We were there for 5 nights, and I am spoiled, taking into consideration I sleep on a Tempurpedic at home. I enjoyed the pool, although the lazy river is not the cleanest, but a few Coronas will make you not care. Wet Republic was disappointing. Long security process to get in which I thought was silly, and on the inside is a very warm shallow pool and a bar with unusually expensive alcohol. And no of course you can not bring your drink in there unlike everywhere else. We thought we were going to a "pool party" but I wouldn't really call it a party at all. Although maybe it was a bad Saturday. Hakkasan was amazing. We got to see Tiesto, and it was a great way to start my birthday celebration. We got on the guest list and in for free, of course the line to get in was an hour and a half but we got in right before he came out. HE was worth the wait. Overall the staff and security at the hotel was polite yet once again not friendly. We did ask for fresh towels and toiletries since we keep the "do not disturb" sign on the whole time during our stays, and it was brought up quite quickly. There was an issue with our sink being clogged when we first got to the room, it was addressed right away, although the lady which answered the call said she's not sure when they can get up there because she wasn't sure how many other tasks they had to perform, once again not friendly. What bumped this review from a 3 star to a 4 star one is the guy who attended us at check out. They take a $200 deposit for the room if you are paying with a debit card and not a major credit card, but you can use that to cover things that you charge to your room during your stay, so I wanted to make sure to do an in-person check-out to look at the bill and what I had spend. I'm pretty sure the guys name was Nui. I overheard the lady in front of us giving him attitude and speaking rudely to him, and despite that he greeted us with the friendliness I did not experience throughout the hotel during my stay. He was cheerful, chatty, asking us about our trip and how it went, advising us about luggage storage and asking us if we needed transportation without us asking. He inquired about our stay and we mentioned the cable going in and out every 15 mins, we were quite nice about it. He was apologetic and explained that they upgraded their system and its possible there's an issue with the wires not being all the way in. Because of that and him seeing the plumbing issue in the beginning of the stay he gave us a refund of $136 although we had used the full $200 charging things to the room. It was unexpected and such an amazing gesture to compensate for our small inconveniences. It's very seldom that everything goes 100% perfect when you are staying at such a big hotel for a period of 5 nights, but it is service like that that separates a 4-5 star hotel from the other ones. I wish you guys could clone Nui. Customer service is so important and he really did made me feel like the MGM is a place I would like to come back to. This review was written solely because of us running into Nui, and although it ended up very long, its all really a compliment to him for his great service.
If I were a twenty-something gansta player, I would have thoroughly enjoyed MGM.  Alas, I'm a 40-something midwesterner in town for a business conference.  And this demographic is not catered to at MGM.  MGM is a solid resort; the rooms were very nice, and except for the 2-inch shard of glass my bare foot discovered by the bed, the room was tasteful, clean and altogether pleasant.  Check-in was relatively fast & courteous.  (My conference was at Mandalay Bay but I've been there before and wanted to experience someplace new.). . The clientele were generally friendly, provided each sentence included at least some level of profanity and the topic of conversation revolved around the latest DJ spinning at Wet Republic. Not knowing any DJs, anywhere, I was quite the old square.  (Notice all the reviews here mentioning DJs?  I rest my case.). . . MGM provided free wifi which is nice.  This was appreciated by the groups of young zombies who sat together, each staring into their respective smartphones rather than conversing.. . The pool is truly amazing and has something for everyone.  The lazy river caters to those re-living spring break while the other pools were excellent for lounging or getting wet.  The bartenders around the pools were friendly and helpful but the young ladies in short-shorts carrying beer buckets to the loudly inebriated were not.  I'm reluctant to call them servers or waitresses as I spent 2 days by the pool and lazy river and was not once asked if I'd like a drink despite waving my arms like a maniac.. . The casino was clean and inviting.  I'm a craps guy & the tables were good with a mixed crowd that was generally fun to play with and only occasionally interrupted by the obnoxious clientele.. . The night life at MGM generally caters to 3 demographics; a) the young, fat ghetto chick stuffed into a tiny dress that barely, but not always, covered their butt; b) amazingly beautiful 20-something women waiting for someone to notice them so that they could ignore them; and c) hordes of young, loud gangsta wannabes trailing after either group.  (I am not a club goer; this is merely my observation from the clientele parading thru the casino to wait in line for 3 hours outside of Hakesan. This had the unfortunate affect of transforming Centrifuge from my hope of an upscale lounge into a kiddie waiting room.). . The women I didn't speak with were either category A or B as described above, and neither would give you the time of day, even if you were innocently just asking for the time of day; the very definition of pretentious.  (Lest you think I'm just an old fatty, I'm a former collegiate athlete & ran the Tough Mudder just for kicks before my conference.). . Whisky Down was a great little side bar that made outstanding cocktails; well made with fine ingredients.  The clientele here were generally retired, which though not my generation, was a welcome relief to the hip-hop.. . The restaurants were outstanding.  The beef tartar and lobster bisque at Craftsteak is worth killing for...which was nearly the case because if that 25ish chap in the ill-advised suit had slumped any further from his stool & spilled my soup.... . The Tap sports bar did what sports should do, provided a good burger, beer and a couple hours repose to enjoy the game.  A couple of pilsners helped improve my disposition despite the 2 surly "ladies" next to me at the bar.  "Excuse me, is this seat taken?"  "Hmmph" with eye roll.  Despite their obvious inebriation, they were able to cheer on the Blackhawks with a very colorful vocabulary.. . I must add the disclaimer that Vegas is a late night town and most of my experience was before midnight.  That said, returning to MGM about 12 on a couple nights, the demographic I mention previously did not diversify but simply multiplied.. . MGM is not a bad place at all, it simply was not a place suited to my tastes.  If you're a twenty-something, hardcore partier, rock on! & enjoy the MGM.  If you're a 30/40-something professional, pay the extra price for a more upscale, mature locale.
This is one of the best hotels to stay at in Vegas. Location is perfect, right on the strip close to all the other iconic hotels - New York New York, Monte Carlo, Caesar's, Luxor, Monte Carlo, among others and it's got everything you could want. The rooms have recently been renovated and even their "basic" room is comfortable and let's be honest you just need a place to pass out because you can't sleep in those nice comfortable chairs at the sports book! The pool area is fantastic too, we've rented a cabana here before and they seriously take good care of you and you can't beat the lazy river. . . The MGM can get busy on holiday weekends, or even just a usual Friday afternoon/night check in, but there's a reason for that, it's popular because it's one of the best, and you can usually find good deals online making it an affordable experience. I would recommend the MGM for anyone making a trip to Vegas.
Amazing! There for a business Trip with Arbonne International! Treated like royalty! Love it.
I liked a lot about the MGM Grand. The room I stayed in was updated and very comfortable, which is probably the most important thing to look for in a hotel. There were a few minor flaws with the room, including the ridiculously bright bathroom light (it was a migraine-maker, and it was the only option. Nothing like getting up to pee in the middle of the night and flipping on a floodlight). And there wasn't a fridge, otherthan the mini bar, which you can't store stuff in. But the beds were comfortable and the decor was stylish enough. . . In addition, the staff was excellent. Everyone I spoke with was very friendly and more than willing to help with any request. This was true across all job titles, including the hotel itself, casino, pool, and convention center. We had an issue with the tub, and they sent maintenance up immediately to check it out. Seriously, it was like 5 minutes. When he arrived, he was great, fixed the problem, and left us some chocolates! . . But there are a few big problems here. The wi-fi in this hotel is abysmal. Wi-fi is important to me, and the fact that this huge hotel with a conference center can't provide it adequately is shameful. It's 2014. I felt like I was trying to use dial up in 1996 but mom kept picking up the phone. And when you arrive at the hotel, an employee hard sells you on checking your bags in case your room isn't ready yet. Don't cave, there's no need to check your bags before you try to check in. If the room isn't ready, the front desk can hold your bags. But my only real qualm was with the wi-fi, and that is a huge qualm.
My boyfriend and I just stayed here Tuesday-Friday. . . The AC: sucked! I like for it to be cold. We never turned off the AC from 65 degrees our entire time there, and I was STILL hot. . . Room service: is ridiculously expensive. I ordered shrimp Alfredo. I wanted extra shrimp, until they said each shrimp would be $5 extra. --SERIOUSLY?! . . Front desk: NEVER answered. We called to ask if we can get a later checkout. Out of the 4 times we called, nobody answered. . . The shower: expect to be in there for a while. Feels like you're showering a 1 month old from how soft the water comes out. . . Valet: super friendly. . . Housekeeping: prompt. . . Guess we'll be staying at planet hollywood next time.
HORRIBLE experience!  We requested a non-smoking room and were directed to the wrong elevator on the opposite side and finally after numerous hotel employees giving us wrong directions we found the room.  The room wreaked of cigarette smoke and looked completely dirty.  We called to request a room transfer because I have asthma and the hotel employee stated that our key would be automatically activated to open the non-smoking room. When we walked again across the hotel to the new room the keys did not work.  We called the front desk and have been waiting for 30 minutes locked out of our room so far after a 6 hour drive.  Very POOR customer service.  Please save yourself a horrible start to your trip and book elsewhere!!!! Still waiting locked out with no one coming to let us in our pre-paid room:-(
Our room was fairly awesome.  I was a big fan of the blackout shade you can drop to make your room impervious to sunlight.. . The big drawback is the smell.  As soon as you walk in, you are hit with a wave that smells like old lady perfume trying to cover smoke.  It's highly unpleasant.. . The casino is spacious and smoky.  Should I deduct stars because I lost badly both nights I played here?  Nah.. . One must-do activity at the MGM is the Television City pilot-rating thing.  You watch a TV pilot and rate it while it plays.  Afterward, you get some coupons for discounted food.  But it's awesome to share your opinion on new TV shows.. . The buffet is decent, but avoid the disgusting Avenue Cafe.  . . This is an awesome place to hang your hat during your time in Vegas.
Decent casino, once you actually get in. Single turn lane to get onto property from the Strip and a gigantic and confusing parking garage situation turns this into a time-consuming process.. . Good selection of dining, snack, and drink options, including a Starbucks on the floor, a pie dessert place, Fat Tuesdays for frozen drinks, and a wok/sushi place that looks rather upscale.. . Floor of slots is kept clean and has a lot of variety, but I played and was in the area for over three hours and was never approached by employees or offered a drink. Found that very odd.. . Bathrooms were very clean and well-located, lobby is palatial and check-in counter features giant screens behind them playing music videos, which is pretty fun. This is definitely a place for young partiers to stay, the floor was constantly congested with girls whose breasts were falling out of their tops and women who were flat-out falling as they made their way back to their rooms. Not my kind of place to stay, but I will visit.
Come stay at the MGM Scam. Seriously worst hotel experience ever. For the money, it's just plain robbery, and we've had better service at a Motel 6.. . Long story short, we made a reservation, but that didn't matter. We were put in the South Tower, and told it was an "upgrade" by the attendant from the West Wing. Afterwards we found out where we reserved our room was better by far, so we were flat out lied to. Then in our crap overpriced room, there was no fridge, no storage, and no lights in the shower. We were surrounded by college drunks sharing rooms, with garbage and empty pizza boxes in the hallway.. . On top of this, be prepared to pay a $28 per day fee, which was explained as mandatory for all guests. This is for spotty wifi service. Yes that's $28 a day for wifi. We also paid $43 for a quesadilla from room service... A single quesadilla.. . This was also our anniversary. We explained this hoping to get a little better treatment, or at least a discount, but no, just a $75 dollar voucher which didn't even cover the wifi.. . If you want to come to Vegas, don't stay here, and don't come longer than a day. It's fun for about 5 minutes, until you get puked on, both figuratively and literally, by apparently the finest Vegas has to offer.
Mgm is a huge place! The hotel is very nicely appointed with larger than average rooms. The casino is large (Grand) and has many things to offer
The first important thing about a hotel is the bed. I love the bed here. . . The second important thing about a hotel is safety.. Not so sure about this one since our door was open by a worker randomly when we were taking a nap inside. . . The third important thing about a hotel is service. Our room was not cleaned during the two nights we stayed. We were a little disappointed.. . Well.. four stars for the nice bed, reasonable price and nice river pool.
Got a good deal for a few days after Memorial Day weekend. Hotel is nicely appointed, clean, comfortable and the non-smoking rooms don't have that lingering smoke smell you might find elsewhere. Great pools and a good selection of restaurants. It's super convenient that you can charge back to you room from other MGM properties like Aria, New York New York, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, and Mandalay Bay. If you plan to spend/gamble a lot, get an mLife card for points and comps. Biggest downfalls were a long check-in, weak a/c in the room, and forget about trying to get a down elevator during check-out time if you're anywhere but the top floor. After having 5 full elevators pass us by, we had to catch an up elevator and ride it back down. I'd recommend for anyone looking for a good deal and easy access to nearby hotels.
Stayed here for 2 nights and it was fun!!! The Buffett was really good. Excellent customer service. Very neat and clean. Seen David Copperfield show. It was cool. I really had a blast!!! I would come back again
24 hours in Vegas and 1 reason I wanted to stay here was the pool. Aside from their dayclub,  this hotel offers several other pools including a nice size lazy river with an amazing waterfall. MGM also allows guests to bring in your own alcoholic beverage as long as it's not in a glass container, awesome! One hotel room key is good for you and one guest.. . Service was a little slow for checking in at 3 am and surprisingly the line was pretty long. We originally booked our room for 2 nights but were only charged for one night...I'm assuming for the late/early check-in. We were also upgraded (for no extra charge) to a 2 queen suite. Bonus!. . If you're looking for glitz and glam this hotel isn't for you but this hotel has a lot to offer in their pools alone.
I have been a guest of the MGM Grand since it opened. I left about 3 years ago to stay at other hotels for a lot of reasons. We are gamblers and have never had to pay for our room or meals. So this review is to help management and those who have never stayed there. The rooms have been remodeled and new bedding. . Even though the temperature out side never got above 100 before memorial day. The room never cooled off enough to sleep under the covers. We had to keep the black out down to keep out some of the heat. . The provided refrigerator was full of things that were way over priced. and had a $50.00 restocking charge? I wondered if I took a bottle of water if it was going to cost me $58.00?. . I ran my hand over the top of the mirror in the bath and dust poured down. I let it hang for a week and it never went away. Not a lot of attention to detail for a high end resort. The ceiling above to sink had stains and  built up grime. .     The pillows were very big and hard. We called and received smaller pillows that were low quality foam. .     Everything at the hotel is way overpriced for what you get. It was a holiday weekend so I expected a crowd. The problem is the layout of the hotel and surrounding area cannot handle the traffic. The valet was a really long wait, as much as twenty minutes  as was the taxis.  Bringing our car back from an outing we had to wait to just get to the valet drop off. . Lines to all of the food service was really long. Lines to everything was to long. When the foot traffic was slower, there were less people to serve you. So if you wait for off peak hours you don't save a lot of time because the staff has been cut down. We had a lot of room service so we didn't have to stand in line for 45 minutes to an hour. Room service was faster and pretty good for the price by comparison. . We had VIP passes that allowed us to go to the head of the lines and that earned us a lot of stares that were not friendly. We chose not to use the passes because it made us feel uncomfortable. I really don't think I will stay there again even though I have made friends over the years with a lot of the staff in the gaming area. 5034 rooms plus convention and concerts are to much for the floor plan. I was knocked down in the restroom. Bumped into countless time by drunks. Stepped on in the crush of the people running . .      Cost is not a factor for us, but I come from humble roots and even though I have the means to pay for anything I want. I will not be robbed in the name of a resort. I don't see MGM lowering their prices because they have a line waiting to pay. . Good luck, You'll need it.
The men wanted to see the slot machine that hadn't hit in like 20 years, or something like that.  Fine, whatever you guys want to do, the ladies are going to go shopping.. . Parking is crazy, huge parking structure.  Take a picture of where you park, it's just so much easier that way.  We started out downstairs, where some of the restaurants and clubs are.  Very nice area, super clean.  Oh and there's a Fat Tuesday there, which the men were super happy about.. . We come up into the lobby and HOLY CRAP...the line to check in was insane!  This was on Monday--- Memorial Day!  The line snaked around the huge gold lion in the middle of the huge lobby. Crazy.. . So we left the guys at some video poker, and we went and did some window shopping.  There are some cute stores, with an assortment of goodies to purchase.  . . The Wedding Chapel was pretty, if you're into that kind of thing.. . There's a Starbucks down where the candy store is, and it was pretty good.  Didn't have raspberry syrup though, not that that's a deal breaker.. . On the way out (a couple of hours later) we passed through the lobby again, and the check in line was all the way out to the lobby doors.  WOW!. . Didn't get a chance to see the rooms or anything, but what we did see was pretty nice!
