First time there and I must say it was extremely good.  Such a variety in every thing being offered.  Next time in Vegas I will  go back.  Desserts were amazing!!
First time at this buffet and it's now our favorite. Food was delicious and very good quality. Would recommend this buffet to friends. Nothing but good things to say! Bone marrow was delicious!
Look guys... this is the best buffet on the strip.   There can be only one.. . First things first, this buffet has the most interesting choices and flavor combinations.  Aside from that, each dish is pretty fucking magnificent.  You can tell care went in to preparing and presenting each one.. . Favorites: risotto, paella, chicken wings, and the salmon.  Also, try one of every dessert.  Just do it, nerd.. . Waiter was a little slow, but I went an hour before they were closing shop so I can forgive that. I'm a Vegas local and this will be my recommendation to all friends visiting.
Best buffet I've been to. The food is different which makes this place unique. Not the typical buffet where you find the same food. Some of the food that are placed on plates are small, but they're good! Probably because you end up getting seconds. They are known for their desserts, which are delicious! The white chocolate mousse cake was divine. Definitely coming back when I'm in town.
Manuel is great!   Fantastic food and service unheard of at a buffet.  Mimosas and bloody Mary's endless.  Sweets, sweets, sweets
Good choice
Came here for brunch. I tried a lot of food but none seems to stand out. Although the heirloom tomato salad with mozz cheese tasted fresh, firm and well balanced. I liked the availability of the quince paste, cheese and cold cuts.  The Kale salad was too vinegary and killed the kale.  Had a shredded beef eggs Benedict and thought the hollandaise had no life. The watermelon sriracha was interesting.  Not impressed as of now but they have the resources to be much better.
This was once my favorite all you can eat spot in Vegas - but like all of the other places, the quality of the food deteriorates as it gets more popular. The food isn't worth it at all - none of the dinner items are decent. If they are consistent with anything, it's how dry all of the meats are (fish, prime rib, chicken, pork).  The only thing that saves this place is the huge chocolate dipped strawberries. But why would I come to a buffet just for that? They really need to work on their individual dishes and redeem their former glory.
A tapas centered buffet, with lots of good quality small plates; perfect for me who just wants a taste and HATES wasting food.  You don't have to waste food here. {Accolade #1}. . HOT TIP #1 - They have sorbet in dessert section which I found to be a perfect pallet cleanser between courses. I did the blood orange.  . . {Accolade #2}  - Pulled pork tacos with homemade guacamole.  Awesome meat/carving stations. I went back twice for the homemade bacon that I could possibly marry.  They slice for you in thick slabs. Yumm, yum. . . Complaint #1 - Not a lot of green vegetable options.  I did enjoy the asparagus salad and the kale salad but that was pretty much it for "real" greens.  The wedge salad had sad lettuce.  Abundant potato options.  . . HOT TIP #2 - Drink happy hour: $5 before 7:00 PM.  They're strict. Don't sit down at 7:01, you will be denied.   We were sad to miss out on top shelf margaritas, but refused to pay $12 at a $44 buffet. . . Complaint #2 - Fishy salmon. Boo!  I love salmon. . . {Accolade #3}  Desserts that actually taste good, and a gluten free dessert station!
I have to admit, this buffet offers an interesting selection of food choices...however I dont think Chinese roasted peanuts should be one of them. For the buffet price, I would have expected a food choice I could not easily find @ Trader Joe's or a baseball game.
I don't understand what all the hype is about when it comes to Vegas Buffets. Admittedly, I have enjoyed Le Village buffet at the Paris, so I was looking for this one to blow me away, seeing as though it's rated higher than Le Village.. . The buffet items looked great upon first inspection, but when you glance closer, it leaves much to be desired. . . I went at lunch time, and they still had breakfast items. They had yummy crispy bacon, the most scrumptious banana walnut pancakes I have ever had and excellent eggs Benedict. Now everything else... Just plain mediocre. . . They tried to do a play on Polenta by adding peas and shredded Parmesan on top, but it completely missed the mark. So did the "spicy" Mac n' Cheese. It didn't even resemble Macaroni n Cheese in the slightest. Then I thought I would try the "Chile Lime Watermelon" (a piece of watermelon cut into a round the size of a quarter with some chili sauce on it), only to discover that it's the same exact flavor that I get with the Mexican fruit carts that add chili and lime on the corner of my street at home! Ummm... Yeah... real innovative. Other dishes just looked plain unappetizing, such as the squid ink pasta. . . I wish I could say the desserts were amazing, since that's what they're known for. The only thing amazing and worthwhile in the dessert section was the gelato station. Great chaitea and chocolate gelato flavors.. . Save your money and try another buffet. This one was a huge fail.
Better than the bellagio buffet! Amazing meat and yummy desserts and gelato.
Wicked Spoon.. TAKE MY MONEY!. . Came for their brunch buffet and thought $39 was a little pricey compared to other buffets on the strip. For $12 more you can add on unlimited mimosas and bloody mary's.. . Their presentation is so cute! Fried chicken served in mini deep fryer baskets, mac and cheese in baby pots, and chow mein in tiny Chinese to go boxes. . . It's a bonus plus that they serve their food in small quantities. So you're easily able to sample all the foods without feeling guilty of wasting.
Hmmmmmmmmmm. Went here to celebrate my 40th birthday with my aunt , uncle & new wife , and was seriously disappointed . The quality of the food is excellent , however the selection was not as vast or as good as I had expected it to be. I have bland tastes so it wasn't quite for me.. . There is plenty of curried dishes and seafood. . . However I recommend the Nutella ice-cream
I vote the Wicked Spoon as the best buffet. Having dinner the next day at the Bachannal Buffet, it was a let down. Although the Wicked Spoon has less quantity of options it still is the best as far as quality and a little cheaper. Just the little touch of bottled water gives the Wicked Spoon a touch of class. The unique entries and better flavors rate them the best buffet in Las Vegas.
ehhhh I wasn't too impressed. we ended up here bc of the awesome yelp reviews and we arrived in vegas at an off hour so most lunch places weren't open and we had had breakfast hours before in Miami.. . we figured we would have plenty of options. and while there was a lot of variety, nothing really impressed me all that much. my favorite was probably the French toast - it was REALLY good. but everything else was just alright - mac n cheese, pizza, sushi, pork loin, kale salad and a variety of desserts - chocolate mousse, coconut cookies, brownies, chocolate covered strawberries. . . they do have an awesome deal $12 for bottomless mimosas, champagne, or bloody marys for up to 2 hours!
Yes wicked spoon IS A MUST, its one of the best buffets I've tried. Came here on my last day in Vegas for dinner and for 1 person is about $50. Yes a bit pricey but you will be eating some very delicious food. . . Presentation is taken to another level at wicked spoon compare to other buffets I have tried. They serve some dishes in little pans or pots. For Chinese dishes they have them in little take out boxes. Very creative.. . Service is what service should always be. Friendly, accommodating staff. . . I tried everything I was able to eat lol there's a pretty wide selection of food. . . Things I can remember trying are..... -artichoke salad it was very light and good.. -the pizza is a must try and addicting. -the covered chocolate strawberries with Oreo crumbs yummmmmm!. -fried chicken was crispy light and tender. -the ceviche was fresh and tasty. -ribs are tender and juicy. -bone marrow yes there's bone marrow and unlimited lol it was delicious. -gelato is a must try!
The service was fine but nothing over the top. The food was not fine. In fact it wasn't even good. I would not recommend this place to anyone, even if the price wasn't astronomical. . . I created a yelp account just to review this restaurant and tell people how awful it is. They try to be  a fancy buffet but the food was just not good. Do not go here.
Wicked Spoon is not your average buffet! . . Before our trip to Vegas, we had seen a special on the Travel Channel featuring buffets and Wicked Spoon was on the show - since we were staying at the Cosmpolitan we were interested (although we are not "buffet people"). We liked what we saw on the show and we were not disappointed when we tried Wicket Spoon on our trip to Vegas.. . We went for dinner and wow, we loved all the "small bite" choices, you could try a bunch of things and not feel like you were totally pigging out or wasting food, it's almost like a tapas buffet. If you didn't care for what you tried, you could go back for something else.. . The room is beautiful as well, and the $50/pp cost seemed reasonable to us, considering the variety - you could have a 4-course meal, and the desserts were out of this world -- again, small and manageable to try a bunch.. . Service was good, plates were always cleaned off the table by the time you got back from another round.. . They also have a "take out" option for $20, which is kinda nice if you are staying in the hotel and just want to camp out on your fabulous balcony and enjoy the view of the Strip.. . We would go to Wicked Spoon again, regardless of whether we were staying at the Cosmo, definitely a nice dinner option, or maybe we will try for brunch next time.
I finally got to try the amazing buffet at the Cosmo. I had it bookmarked for over a year. We came on our last day which was Sunday night for dinner. It was a little bit over $50. Since for me that was expensive I decided to go all out and stuff my face!. . Before I start talking about the food lets talk about the atmosphere there. It is very nice and elegant in there. Also they provide 2 big thing of bottled water. The crowd is very relaxed dressed casual. . . Now lets talk food. I tried the following: . . BBQ Shrimp- it came in a tiny pan. Comes with 2 shrimps smothered in what said was BBQ sauce but it was like a BBQ/cocktail sauce. . . Crab legs- the beautiful part about these is that they are already open so you don't have to struggle trying to eat them. . . Artichoke salad- delicious and fresh if you like artichoke. . Asparagus Salad- Absolutely a must try. Fresh and the dressing on it is really good. . Salmon with crunch on top- lemony and buttery and so tender. Cooked to perfection. . Greek Salad- favorite salad of the night for sure. The combination of the vinaigrette, olive oil and lime juice was perfect. . . Caesar Salad with tuna mackerel- had a weird taste didn't really like it. . Shepherd's Pie- it came in a cute little pot. It was delicious. I had never tried Shepherd pie and I thought it was delicious. . Spinach Cream- So good with a side of bread. . Pork Loin- WOW! I wish I would've gotten a few extra slices but since there was an employee slicing it I was a bit shy to ask for more. It was so thick yet tender and full of flavor. . . Bone Marrow- Personally I did not like it. It was my first time trying bone marrow and probably my last. The texture and flavor I just didn't like it.. . Dirty Rice with dried fruit- also didn't like the combination of this. . Risotto topped with parmesan cheese- another one of my favorites of the night. Great taste and combination. . Sushi Rolls & Salmon individual sushi- I love sushi and I was a bit disappointed because they tasted like 7-11 sushi rolls. . . Asian Noodles- by the time I got to this section I was already full but I still gave them a try. The noodles were great. . . Beef Teriyaki with veggies- So good. The flavor was intense. . . Green curry Rice- maybe I am not a fan of curry because I didn't really like it. . . Dessert- Carrot Cake and chocolate covered strawberries   were really good but that's about it. They need to improve on their desserts.. . Overall, I got my money's worth. I will definitely recommend this to friends and family. It is a bit pricier than other buffets but it is worth it.
Last week my friend birthday and we went to eat at wicked spoon buffet at Cosmo , we don't like it because the employee at seafood section was so rule and mean ,we never coming back and eat there again
I finally went to Wicked Spoon, meh. I waited in a line with only 10 people in it for 20 minutes just to pay $100 to stand 5 more minutes waiting to be seated. The waitress who took our beverage order was painfully slow and the two top tables were way too close together. There was a lot of food. Mac n cheese bar, if you're in to that and lots of pretty desserts. Nothing was amazing. The best thing I had was the espresso-$6 on top of the $50 per person. There is no specialty, just a cool sign and address. For that kind of $, you could eat almost anywhere else!
My parents don't want to eat too much for dinner so I can only choose their lunch buffet. I know they won't have too much seafood. However, all the dishes tastes really good. They make really special/creative combination of ingredients to make dishes. I tried Wynn lunch buffet twice and Wicked Spoon lunch buffet is much better. The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is the price. But it's still really good choice for lunch buffet.
Really really good , Nothing like any other buffet !! Highly recommend !!! They have a Macaroni and cheese bar ... Custom made amazing !
I still think the Mresort buffet is the best with free beer,  wine and cider. We were staying at the Cosmo and didn't want to drive Sat. to the Mresort.  Dinner here starts @ 5pm. and is almost $50 including tip, tax. The prime rib sucks, Mresort's is better.. They have bone marrow, pork belly/I got a cyst from that. Desserts are ok. I'm not into purple dye but I ate the French macaroons. Ice cream is alright.
Stopped here for a dinner buffet.  The choices were amazing!  The highlight for me was probably the mac n cheese station.  Sat and ate, and ate, and ate some more.  Everything is in nice small portions, so you can try everything.  The small portions made it nice so that you could try new things without wasting too much if you don't like it.  A lot of the food came in trendy packaging or serving vessels.
This review is for the BRUNCH only. After reading so many raving yelp reviews I couldn't wait to try this place out!! We were even lucky enough (or unlucky because we lost so much money) to get 2 free comps from the hotel! We already had dinner plans so we came for brunch. The food was good (I used the word "good" on purpose. Not bad, but not excellent) and there was a fair amount of variety but surprisingly not many universal options. For example- no berries at the fruit station, only 4 types of very basic sushi, a whole row devoted to toast (I didn't come to an expensive buffet for toast), and a whole lot of weird stuff like octopus salad and lamb sausage (which was flavorless) and a bunch of dried out meat carving stations. Nothing spectacular except for the French toast-which actually was spectacular. Maybe my expectations were set too high, But from other Yelpers reviews and photos it seems that the WOW factor would come from the dinner buffet which we did not have the opportunity to experience. . . Short story-save your brunch money and go for dinner.
I love the french toast! The layout is nicer than Bacchanal, but Bacchanal has a wider variety. It's still my favorite buffet though.
The presentation here is absolutely gorgeous. The items are all plated in individual portions, and are visually stunning. There is a wide variety of unique and exotic dishes. Unfortunately, the flavors of the dishes don't justify the $50+ pp price tag. The food was mediocre.
Delicious!!! The asparagus cream, bone marrow, and paella was delicious (to name a few). Variety was amazing and ample. I think this buffet is way better than Caesars. 4 stars because the dessert was pretty bad...like grocery store bad. Otherwise, home run.
This review was due for months.... . . We went to this buffet because it was supposed to be one of the best gourmet buffet.  They did have a lot gourmet food but I was disappointed that they did not served any filet mignon or lobster tails. It was over $40 per person.. . Food: 3.5/5    Plenty of food choices, they did have a good beef ribs, mac and cheese stations (to make your own) , asian food,  limited seafood selection, appetizers, sushi, and limited desserts selection. . - Quality of food was pretty decent. Some of the presentations were great, some were just horrible!  . . Atmosphere:  4/5 great atmosphere ! took us a while to sit us down because their bottle is their cashier set up.  Other than that, the place was nicely theme with nice furniture.  . . Service : 3/5  way too slow. Took too long to clean our plates up, to re-pour our water.  We did not see the waiter for a span of 20 minutes.  We had to look for him a few times.  . . Overall, i would consider to come again but just to try other food. However, my expectation are low now. There are other gourmet buffet that I will try first over this place.
I cant even write a review, your just gonna have to trust me. Place is GOOD!!
Best buffet in Vegas...and one of the best restaurants.. . Forget everything you've heard about buffet food. Get thee to Wicked Spoon for a dining experience comparable to any of the fine dining establishments in Vegas. You have the ease and convenience of buffet-style dining, but the food is so much better. My personal favorite is the sweet pea risotto, served in miniature cast iron skillets, but you'll find something to suit every palate here. . . Service is great and food is fresh- the opposite of what I usually find at most buffets. Wicked Spoon is a can't-miss experience.
THE best Buffett I ever visited. Everything is just different and great. The waitress we had was super nice and helpful. So friendly. . The food comes in little nice container like a small frying basket for the chicken wings. They offer out of the ordinary food items. Everything in small portions so that you can try more things. The roasted bone marrow is very tasty. But make sure to leave room for dessert. I am usually not a huge fan from Buffett style but this is a must try.
This was THE MOST FUN I've ever had dining out!!!   What a great concept, small plates/bites so you can sample amazing, different foods.   If you're a foodie, this is your place!!  We had the dinner buffet as well as the brunch and both were amazing.  To call this a buffet doesn't do it justice, it is, as they call it a 'dining experience'.   So glad we checked it out, best meals of our vacation!! Well worth the money.
I went to this buffet with three other people and none of us liked it. The buffet presentation was great, as stated in pervious reviews. The actual menu was the problem for me. I don't think I was cultured enough to enjoy their offerings. The item that stood out to me the most was the shrimp that still had eyes and legs. The dessert was very mediocre and looked better than it tasted. I spent most of my time walking around the buffet with an empty plate because the food was totally different from what I would normally eat. I'm glad it worked for some, but it's just not for me!
We came here for dinner (cost $41/person) with our 2 year-old. All of the dishes were non- suitable for her because they were designed for adult tastes. Even the pizza wasn't the usual kid-type. . . Some dishes were good, such as the risotto. The Asian dishes were not good and pretty salty. The sushi was poorly made and I could tell by looking because I am a sushi expert. It also tasted bland and crumbled upon taking my first bite which should never happen with real sushi. The desserts were plentiful but I only like one of them. The gelato was too sweet for my taste. . . Service was good. Our server kept bringing us drinks and clearing our plates. I liked the atmosphere and our booth was huge. I would probably go to another buffet next time instead of this one though based on solely the food.

Having not attended a proper Vegas 'buffet' since September of 2007 it was actually an inquiry from a blog-reader regarding my recommendations for an upcoming trip that led me to 'discover' The Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon, a brief e-mail to the hotel's concierge landing me access to the VIP line plus an eye-opening tour of the facilities by the culinary team.  Located in the West Tower with ornate chandeliers, ample glass, and plenty of shine it would be easy to say that Wicked Spoon is the 'nicest' buffet in which I have dined but with expansive size as well as selection - over 150 items offered at $38 for brunch - it would be equally fair to suggest the immaculately clean space also represents one of The Strip's biggest "bangs for the buck" as a team of chefs spread across several open kitchens work diligently replenishing each station with ornate small plates at a speed that would put all but the most seasoned short-order cook to shame.  Expeditious and friendly in service with purified water on the table and good coffee refilled nearly every time a plate was cleared it was with a focus on variety that I explored the various stations of Wicked Spoon and although not every dish was a success I'd say 85% of the sixty-six items I sampled were at least good while a few far exceeded expectations.  Starting sweet then veering savory and subsequently switching back-and-forth as new plates emerged from the kitchen items such as the fresh fruit pastries immediately showed the strength of the pastry department and while chocolate options proved a touch heavy handed the gelato selection was stunning, the 'white chocolate coffee' and pistachio both on par with Art of Flavors in terms of texture and nuance.  Moving past disappointing Italian and Asian fare aside from swoon-inducing sweet polenta, well accompanied congee, and caramelized pork belly as well as duck it was on to more brunch-oriented offerings that I turned and while both the benedict and slab bacon shined the macaroni and chicken were merely decent - clever titles aside.  Largely skipping salads aside from the impressive beets but impressed by fruits, cheese, cereals, and charcuterie it was finally at the three-hour mark that I'd finally filled up and having already once sampled the delightful custard soaked Pullman it was to creativity I turned; two slices of the buttery cinnamon bread buried beneath a mountain of house-whipped Chantilly cream, Maple Syrup, Dates, and Granola far outperforming any 'designer' French Toast you'd pay $15 for elsewhere in the city.  . . Unable to compare Wicked Spoon to other Vegas buffets given my relative inexperience with the genre I can only say I was stunned by not only the quality of the food but the passion behind the project.  In a world of "China Buffets" and Golden Corral's where neither presentation nor preparation seems to matter, let alone freshness or sourcing, Wicked Spoon chooses to function like a proper small-plates restaurant with sparkling cleanliness to compliment a trained Chef's vision.
We had breakfast at the wicked spoon included with our expedia booking. You can have breakfast from 8am to 3pm which is great especially if you enjoyed Vegas` nightlife the night before. The breakfast buffet was awesome! You can have everything here: French toast, chicken Wings, salat, icecream....
We kicked off our bachelorette party weekend with a brunch buffet at the Wicked Spoon in the Cosmopolitan. I wish I could remember every single item I tried, but sadly, I lack a photographic memory. I do remember the following:. . Angry Mac n' Cheese, spicy salmon roll, bone marrow, polenta, black squid ink pasta, a passion fruit and mango(?) shooter, HUGE cocktail shrimp, French toast, goat cheese in a mini cone, wheatberry salad, goat cheese panna cotta and a ton of desserts (white chocolate citrus cake, baba au rhum, raspberry white chocolate mousse, lemon custard tart, chocolate pistachio cake, chocolate-covered strawberries). My memory of the desserts is much better since I snapped a photo :). . As with any buffet, some items are hit or miss. Some I devoured, some I only took a bite or two. Same story with the dessert. I loved how everything was presented in small portions. Sometimes you had to scoop stuff out of a tray just like a standard buffet,  but other times they served the items by the dish. . . The dessert bar was insane, though. It was hard not to get one of everything. If only they had macarons that day! I was too full to partake in the gelato bar, though that looked amazing.. . Service was good. Non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary, so I definitely washed down my meal with some hotgreen tea.. . The price for brunch was $27 before tax. Not as steep as I was expecting. Make sure to come on an empty stomach and wear stretchy pants.
One of the best buffets I've eaten at yet! The French toast was amazing, the salmon eggs Benedict makes you want more & the kale salad is refreshing! The quality and selection will be bringing me back!
Wen't for Sunday brunch.  I guess I can see why this is the highest rated buffet in Vegas, although it has some tough competition from the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars.  . . The strong points were definitely the breakfast foods and dessert.  Don't miss the french toast and banana pancakes!  Egg scrambles and made-to-order omelet bar are awesome too.  Did not spring for the bottomless mimosas ($47??  no thanks!). . Generally a great brunch buffet.
We went for dinner as it was my first time, but not my friends. We went at a great time as we did not have to wait to be seated. There wasn't a large dinner crowd yet. . . Food: the food was decent, however not a lot of seafood choices. Would have like to have a lobster dish, scallop dish something. The desert options were decent + gelato options...great.. . Service: our server was good. She kept checking on us repeatedly. That was a plus.. . Atmosphere: cool little setting. . Overall: I'd eat here again
Sunday dinner review  from May 18, 2014. ..   Avoid this buffet if you want food that is quality without being distorted by added crap that masks that flavor.   I'm a meat and potatoes lover, not a "foodie" so I found very little to eat here.  I took a slice of the "prime" rib which certainly was not prime grade meat.  I tried the wasabi mashed potatoes since my other potato choice was fingerling potatoes with duck fat.  I would have appreciated simple plain mashed potatoes no additions.  The wasabi was too spicy for me..   I thought I'd have fried chicken since the beef roast was just ok,  only fried chicken was wings in a little wire basket, I only eat breast pieces, so that wasn't an option.. .  Tried a roll, it was stale and dry, after 1 bite I was done.. .   As others have said there are no salad greens to make a simple salad with dressing.. .   Desserts nothing special I haven't seen at Mirage, Bellagio, Harrahs, buffets.  Their sorbet/gelato section does have a wider variety of choices than other buffets.. . So here's what I was able to eat for $41. 1 slice of rib roast, 2 small scoops of raspberry sorbet.  Iced tea and water.. . My server was good, kept the water and iced tea full and removed plates quickly.
nothing to eat for lunch! I rate 0 star. do not be fooled by reviews. This one is far worse than Bacchanal in Caesars. never come back here again
The best brunch buffet I have ever had. Far exceeded my expectations. I like that they "encourage" you to take smaller potions - allowing the focus to be on the quality of the food. Wow!
Went to the Wicked Spoon for dinner tonight, on the Friday before Memorial Day weekend; we arrived early so we wouldn't have to wait too long.We were seated by our very polite and pleasant server, who took our drink orders and gave us a quick tutorial on the different food stations. She was attentive throughout our meal, clearing plates, checking in on us, etc.. . The Wicked Spoon is an excellent choice for those who like food with flavor, and enjoy a variety of cuisine. The salad section included individual wedge and caesar salads, and a variety of other cold foods. Again, if you are expecting a traditional salad bar, you will not find it here. There is, however, an excellent selection of comfort foods, many with a twist!. .  There is an excellent selection of hot foods, and as several reviewers have said, many are presented in creative ways; the creamed leaks, for example, were in individual tiny saucepans. The desserts were substantial in my opinion; a very comprehensive sorbet and gelato bar, along with the obligatory selection of pastries, etc. I recommend the macarons (not a misspelling) and the chocolate covered strawberries.. . Our entire experience at the Wicked Spoon was top notch, from the welcoming staff to the excellent food choices, to the ambience. We might even go back for dinner tomorrow night!
There wasn't a huge selection of foods like some of the other Vegas buffets such at the one at theWynn. It's also a bit out of the way to get to. I definitely wouldn't go back.
Hands down the best buffet in Las Vegas. It wouldn't be a stretch to consider this place one of the best overall restaurants in Las Vegas either. You see, this place isn't your traditional Vegas value buffet (think Griswold's Vegas Vacation). No, these guys serve quality dishes with superior ingredients. The dishes look attractive too. I loved the southern fried chicken served in a mini fry basket. The various Chinese dishes served mini Chinese take-out boxes were cool too. The Korean short ribs and the shrimp and grits are both must tries. You can't get bone marrow at your local Golden Corral ether. Again, get the traditional "buffet" picture out of your head! This is high quality stuff served to satisfy your appetite and then some. Be sure to hit up the dessert bar afterwards. The chocolate covered strawberries and french macarons were very rich and flavorful!. . Highlights:. Beef short ribs. Crab legs . Shrimp and grits. Southern fried chicken. Prime rib. Dessert bar!
A meat lover's dream! All you can eat buffet with ham, beef, chicken and more! . If you're a seafood lover, you are in the wrong place! . . We came for brunch around 10 am, it was very crowded already and about a 15 min wait. . . Food selection included breakfast, omelet station, meat and cheese and a small Chinese station.  There is a dessert area, catering to your sweet tooth. . . It is reportedly the best Buffett here in Vegas, and all you can drink can be added for total price of 51 dollars per person. See pics forfood selection.  . . Service was attentive and waiter brought us 4 rounds of drinks.  He did try to add extra on our drink but we said this is the wrong bill and he corrected it. He admitted he pressed the button too many times and that was the cause of the error. . . Food was tasty and not too salty. Plenty of selection for the most picky. However more seafood selection would be an improvement.
Very disappointed over this place, heard such great things about their brunch. Food quality was equal to a place like Texas station, lines weren't too long and service was good. Just poor food quality and selection was average at best, walking through the entire casino was a hassle but anticipated it being worth it, couldn't valet park as they were only taking hotel guests. Definitely tell the clientele of this place are the flashy, stick up their behind type even though you can tell most of their crap is knock offs or cheap sterling silver or zirconia but too materialistic of a casino and for the price, bellagio, the m, Caesars and even Rio and the Silverton have this buffet beat hands down.
As I get older, I realize I'm not that into buffets.  Especially with buffets in vegas, there isn't that much that would really justify the high price for the quality of food.  A great entree for the same price will satisfy.  . . We approached this place not wanting to stuff ourselves but to taste all the things we normally would not.  Some tasty dishes like octopus salad, bone marrow, and chinese duck legs make for a yummy experience.  Wish they had alaskan crab instead of snow crab.  This is one the pricier buffets on the strip, and it's definitely worth trying.  Their coffee torte is the best dessert I've had.  I would not choose Wicked Spoon over Bachanal.  Bacchanal is still king of them all.
MEH. 40 for brunch. I've been to numerous las vegas buffets and fir the price, I expected a lot more. Wynn and rio seafood top this when it comes to price comparison. However people probably pay this for the experience. Wicked spoon is different because they serve SOME of their food on individual plates to make it look more appealing. Also expect a really long wait.
Don't go!!  Worst buffet I ever had last night. $56.75 per person including tax and tips for few main dishes which are not very testy. Not worth it.
In my six trips to Las Vegas, I have made it a point to try as many buffets as possible. Some are great because of a low-price and others are great because of the variety. What most buffets lack, however, is the ability to serve high-quality food for the masses. . . Despite the challenges of serving thousands of people from what amounts to a trough, the Wicked Spoon does a tremendous job. It holds the distinction for me as the best brunch buffet I've had in Vegas, even better than the Bellagio. In fact, the only buffet at the Comsopolitan's level is the Aria Buffet, but that's for another review.. . The Cosmopolitan has better, newer and more modern ambiance than places like the Bellagio, Monte Carlo and Planet Hollywood. The waitstaff is more attentive as you would expect for an expensive place.. . The Wicked Spoon is great down to the details. The juices are fresher the desserts are better, the menu is more unique and even the presentation is just better.. . Here are a few of the unique eats the Wicked Spoon had to offer: braised pork Benedict, chicken apple sausages, angry (spicy) mac and cheese, breakfast pizzas and more.. . Overall, I was very impressed with the menu (the food on it, not the way it was typed). In fact, there was a type-o on the menu and a missing comma made me order a mixture of cranberry and pineapple juices that didn't exist. But they made it for me and it was amazing.. . Best Bet: Weekday brunch is cheaper than the weekends.
This buffet is hands down the best in Vegas right now. It gets 5 because of the location (Cosmopolitan) and for the food. Be sure to be there at 5pm when they open because the wait can get long. My favs are the fried chicken wings which come in these mini French fry baskets, safron shrimp rice and the desserts. They have everything from hot lava cakes to French macaroons.
Hands down the best buffet I've ever had in Vegas !!!!!. If you don't eat here you're stupid !!!!!!!!
Definitely not your typical buffet. Brunch included pancakes, French toast, bacon, sausage, spicy mac and cheese, beef/pork carving station, chicken tandoori, bone marrow, pizza station, fruit and salad, an Asian section, mashed cauliflower, several egg dishes, and a dessert/gelato bar. The line on a Tuesday was a good 45 minutes... First waiting to pay, then waiting for a table. The meat was dry, but otherwise the food was delicious and fresh. I'd recommend it, but definitely would rather try some other buffets before declaring it a favorite.
I was quite disappointed with this buffet after reading all of the high reviews. If you are serious about food quality and perfection, The Buffet at the Wynn is exceptionally better than the Wicked Spoon.
As a local, I have ate at many buffets and this is the buffet I love and recommend.  Food is fresh and a huge selection. As a gluten free and vegan, I am often limited.  Not at Wicked Spoon.  . . You cannot get any better than Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo.  I love their vegetable section. And for my meat loving friends, they rave about the meat.. . My favorite is the presentation and the cleanliness.
Although I've only been to Wicked Spoon and M Buffet (a good drive away from the Strip), the food at both are good in my opinion. Also, the interior is nice.. . It's not cheap, but this is Vegas. There's a variety of food and desserts to choose from and their alcoholic drinks were not bad ($5 mojito/martini/etc) and were rather strong (good if you like that).. . The first time I came here with some friends we had lunch and stayed so long they started transitioning to the dinner food! We were excited to see the crab legs and were a disappointed when we tasted them---they were very salty. However, on my second visit here they were fine so I guess it was a bad batch?. . I loved their little salmon plates as well as the kale salad and fried chicken. Lots of other tasty things offered, including good meats and bottomless soda and juice.
This was my favorite buffet out of all the ones on the strip. Love the decor and the ambiance in general. The bathrooms (located in far left corner when you enter) are also pretty nice as well. It's also $41 per person for dinner, which is not a bad deal at all for the selection they have.. . Now for the food, I'd recommend:. (+) chocolate covered strawberries (I made the mistake of filling up on the savory foods and unfortunately didn't get to eat as much of these as I'd like). (+) crab legs. (+) spicy tuna roll. (+) calamari skewer. (+) bone marrow, of course . (+) prime rib. (+) watermelon with sriracha. . Foods I'd skip:. (-) asparagus moose. (-) tako salad . (-) most of their asian food selection .  . Service was okay, but servers behind the counter seem pretty irritated. I'd say Bacchanal at Caesars tops Wicked Spoon on this.
Hands down the best and most fun Buffet in Vegas. This is the hipster buffet.. . All the food comes in little tiny pots or frying baskets and isn't served trough-like at similar style places on the strip.. . A staple is the carnitas, bone marrow, crab legs , short rib panini, and the outstanding dessert bar.. . Come hungry, bring your camera, and be ready to #foodporn all night long on Instagram.
Awesome buffet- exceeded every expectation that we had- which is hard to do! Well priced and everything we had was delicious! It was creative, had a great variety and each item seemed like you had ordered it a la cart. Loved the desserts- especially the molten chocolate cake with raspberry sauce. We will be back!
My first time here and they have all you can drink mimosas and champagne! :D For $14 more...that's a pretty good deal ;) The food here is okay at best.. . For brunch it was around $35 per person. . . PROS: . -very friendly and exceptional customer service, especially because one of my friends persistently asked for more drinks and our server was more than happy to accommodate my friend. . -various types of food that will satisfy any palate. . -made to order omelet station as well.. . CONS:. -I was eating a chocolate covered strawberry and I noticed they didn't fully wash the strawberry. I don't think they washed the strawberry at all because I saw some bugs crawling all over the strawberry. Lost my appetite right there and then.. -Some of the food like risotto was really dry and not cooked well because I could still taste the crunchiness of the rice . -I also tried lox and bagel. The lox had a really bad fishy smell. To me that means the salmon is long overdue. . . Overall it was an okay place to eat brunch. Dishes besides the ones I complained about were okay. Also, you can't really screw up eggs so I chose to eat that instead. . . It was a good place to try but I think I'd go to Wynn for the buffet. Maybe the dinner or lunch at Wicked spoon is good but brunch was okay at best.
