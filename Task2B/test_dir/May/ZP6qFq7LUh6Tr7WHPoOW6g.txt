My girl friend and I dig their Huevos dish. The staff if friendly and helpful. Service is always great. . We need more places like this in Las Vegas.
My friend and I stopped in here after the Komen Race and we were so happy that we did! The ambience is great, neat, upbeat and the counter that we sat at felt like the Chef's table. We could see how seamlessly and positively the Cooks, Servers, Plate Finisher and Runners worked together! Plus, the food was AMAZING (BLT and Killer Grilled Cheese), the kitchen was spotless and our waitress was fantastic! We also met and spoke with the manager, Scott, and he was super friendly! My friend and I will definitely be back and I will be bringing my Fiance, too!
Eat is special.. . The food is outstanding! I've been here numerous times and have never had a bad meal. . . This trip I ordered the truffle egg sandwich with taters. The pair of fluffy scrambled eggs were nestled with two thick strips of bacon and feta and sauteed mushrooms that tasted of truffles. This all rested between warm soft chiabata bread. For $12 I was winning life.. . I also had a cup of Guatemalan coffee, creamy smooth and perfectly brewed for $3.. . . This place is often packed. Be ready for a long wait if you come at peak lunch hours. Today we arrived at 11:45 and happily only had a 10 minute wait to be seated. . . Come try Eat. You will be glad you did.
I had a wonderful meal at Eats, The potatoes were great, the coffee was good, and I really liked that they got all there greens from a local farm and not some GMO infested place. They were busy when my friend and I walked in, so we went back to our parking meter to put some more time on it. We walked back in and I told the young lady that my name was on the list she said just give her a second and she would seat us, which she did. Our server, who never told us her name, was apparently not in the best mood. I mean I've been working in the hospitality/serving industry pretty much my whole working career, which started at 14, and we all know, in order to make it, sometimes you have to put on a smile and Fake it. I didn't know their breakfast stopped at 11, which is my fault as a new patron, but eggs can be served all day, 2 eggs anyway you would like.... does not mean anyway you would like... its ok though. i got some truffle oil egg meal that was alright, but i wanted to be healthy and i wanted breakfast and they said that they could only do scrambled eggs, not an omelet.... i couldn't even get veggies, which again, my problem for not reading more into the place but since they had gotten some really good reviews on here (yelp) I was like screw it lets go its probably awesome, which again, the food was, but not the service. When the server got to our table with our food, she asked if we needed anything else, my friend I was with just said her toast, which was sitting in the window i saw it, and i watched it sit for about 10 minutes. We also wanted to split our check at the end of our meal, which one young lady said they couldn't split it, but they could put a different amount on each card, which they did. We then received a letter in our check about splitting the check, saying they were slammed and next time only one credit card per table, Well, this place is not that big, there were 4 empty tables, I'm gonna say 5 servers and a manager there. which some were just standing around, our server who was having not the best day also moved about as slow as molasses. She also snapped her fingers at a line cook, and the restaurants I've worked at, if she would of done that to them, when were "slammed" they probably would of chopped her finger off. lol.... anyways, i suggest that you go there for the food, just don't expect the best service and remember ONLY ONE CREDIT CARD PER TABLE. If we pulled that at my old job in florida which is a fast pace tequila bar and Mexican restaurant, you would get fired. not trying to be snobby or anything like that and sorry if i come off that way but i feel like when I'm serving a guest or anything i usually act pretty hyped because if I'm nice and they're too "in the biz" I'm probably going to get tipped over twenty percent and will probably make new friends, wether I have the time or not, I always wear a smile. I don't know, maybe I'm just a people person. again though the food was EXCELLENT.
I'm visiting Vegas with my girlfriends for a few days. We went to EAT yesterday for breakfast and it was amazing. The atmosphere was relaxed and the service was great. It was so nice that the entire staff checked in on our table. I had the granola/berries, scrambled eggs, and wheat toast (basic only bc I don't eat meat; just seafood). I loved every bit of it. I also had the herbal tea which was refreshing. I will definitely come back if I'm ever back in town!
Everything we have tried here has been spectacular!  Eat is a truly special place with exceptional food, service, and ambiance!
Eat was quite good. i had the corn hash and toast and it was pretty good. My friends and i went there for breakfast and we were impressed. The atmosphere is pretty laid back and it feels and looks clean. The food amazing. You will like it. It would be a nice breakfast date place too :)
It was a long wait to get seated but it was well worth the wait. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs, it was a big ass steak, very good ... I'd recommend this place
We have been coming to EAT since they opened the doors. They have the best pancakes! By far the best breakfast and lunch in the Las Vegas area
Came here on Mother's Day.  Bad decision.  Overall, the menu & food were good, the service was good as well.  However, I ordered 2 eggs over medium and got 2 eggs over barely easy.  The smoked bacon had great flavor but was served lukewarm and wilted.  The coffee was bitter.  Also, they had a loud 2-piece band playing in this small, acoustically challenged restaurant. Without the music playing, you could barely carry on a conversation.  With the music playing, forget about it.  And I'm sure the mothers here loved that they couldn't talk with their children during brunch.  What were they thinking?  However, I will make a 2nd attempt (sans coffee) because the service was good and my wife's cornedbeef hash was good.  Big ass pancakes looked good too.  I think I just happened to get a bad meal this time.  Shit happens.
Sat at the counter ... started w cinnamon biscuits which are very light and finished w a strawberry topping blackberry s ... Soo good.  The best was the huevos motulenos. Eggs perfectly cooked and with a great blend of sauces and the plantine mixed in.    Wife raved in her Eggs Benedict as well.  Probably the best breakfast experience I have ever had!!
We just happen to go on Mother's Day. Walking in and was greeted very nicely and seated promptly. After much research I saw the owner overseeing the flow of the restaurant which I thought was cool. Soon after we got there they had nice LIVE smooth jazz. The atmosphere is nice (love the art) and despite it being busy they were on there game with service! Alright now with FOOD: I started with the biscuits with strawberry compost, not overly sweet, moist, yummy starter. My mom got the eggs,bacon,potato dish. She enjoyed it!! I had the shrimp and grits which was very good! Never had it before and the flavors all blanched nicely! The bacon was especially good. I had a great experience and defiantly will be back!
It's a shame that everyone doesn't get an automatic tweet when in Vegas to check this place out. Thanks for a recommendation from a fellow tweeter I found my way to eat. Skip the buffet and try this out. Had the poached eggs on hash with sourdough. Perfectly seasoned, usually reach for salt and pepper at these places but not this time. Good portion size not too much and not too little. Friendly staff, clean and quaint atmosphere.
We tried this place yesterday based on the number of votes Eat has.  . Frankly, I was most unimpressed with Eat; here is my review:. . Food:  I ordered the chicken fried steak with gravy, toast, scrambled, and potatoes.  For starters, the meat itself wasn't the greatest; it was tougher than expected and didn't cut well.  The batter/breading was strange; it wasn't hot (temperature), crispy, or crunchy....it was just lukewarm and flavorless.  The potatoes had a great "potato" flavor but that was about it...they were advertised as chive potatoes; we didn't find or taste any chives!  The gravy, for myself, was the worst part.  The gravy was too heavily flavored with smoked paprika; it's way obvious!  There was so much smoked paprika in the gravy that it became overwhelming and I could only eat 1/4 of my chicken fried steak. The scrambled were scrambled...how can that be messed up?  I feel if the toast weren't sliced so thick, then it would just seem like ordinary toast; it's just regular thick-sliced toast...no butter which was irritating; every place butters the toast, unless the customer declines.. . Customer Service:  We didn't receive our drinks from the bus person, instead, we waited until our waitress came to take our order...very lame; especially seeing as how there's at least a dozen staff running around the place.  They were very nice and pleasant.. . Atmosphere:  Divey.  I didn't really like our seat.  Right next to my head was another solid-wood table....pushed directly up to ours, only the edge of the table was right next to my temple the whole meal!  I don't know who planned the floor space but would have rather sat outside.  I like their open kitchen.. . Price:  Not bad.. . Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but I was really disappointed with my experience in general.  There's way too much hype for a place with such a scant menu...there's nothing special about anything; where's the locally sourced ingredients, organic?  Only a handful of ingredients were labeled as organic.  Honestly, I didn't find simple complexity in their food, i found simplistic, bland food prepared in a hurry.  I love the downtown area but I don't support restaurants that thrive on overrated reviews and underperform as a result of their oversized egos.
I am in love with this place. From the minute we walked in, it felt comfortable and warm. The servers and guests alike were smiling and obviously enjoying their morning! We were sat immediately, and our drink order was taken in moments. We had the perfect amount of time to peruse the surprisingly diverse menu and when our drinks arrived, the gal who delivered them took our order to streamline the process. . Speaking of our beverages: best cup of coffee I've had in a long long time! Mothership Roasters just gained a new supporter! When I asked another employee about it, she was friendly and knowledgeable. She referred me to where I could purchase it for home (there at eat. or Sunrise Coffee) and showed genuine interest in my curiosity. The OJ was also exceptionally good, the fiancee could not stop raving about it. . Food arrives very quickly and very hot- exactly how I want my breakfast! I had shrimp and grits which were so good I almost cannot even put it into words.. creamy grits, perfectly over easy eggs, crispy mapled bacon, tender butterflyed shrimps, savory creamy sauce andfresh lively pico de gallo. I almost cleared my plate, which is a huge feat for me. Man had chilequiles, with fresh crispy tortilla chips, delicious vegetables and fluffy eggs. The habanero sausage was the best part for sure, though it was all amazing. . Not too pricey, worth every penny no question.. We will be going back and often!
Eat is FANTASTIC! I don't understand why they aren't open for dinner or why breakfast ends at 11am (on weekdays)....their food is so great I want it all the time. . . Highlights:. Huevos Montulenos: amazing breakfast/brunch dish that feels relatively healthy. Basically a more exciting huevos rancheros with over easy eggs, two delicious salsas, black beans, feta, and bananas (they were a little surprising at first, but added an interesting element of sweetness).. . Bahn Mi Sandwich--this dish is no longer on the menu, but it was super delicious and sometimes available if they have the ingredients in house. . . Downtown Benedict--classically amazing in every way. . . perk: super comfy seating. . . Don't order tea or orange juice, it's crazy over priced.
Great food, stylish interior, professional staffs.  This is very good restaurant overall.  I had shrimp and grits, and ginger ale.  I really love the shrimp and grits!  In downtown area, I am kind of feeling a beautiful hope and pride of the people and the community.  Sure, I want to come back here!
Where the place is located can feel a little sketchy. Parking is only on the streets with paid meters. Once you're inside the restaurant, you'll forget you're in downtown LV. Food is really good. Service was great. Can't really go wrong with the menu. I was a bit disappointed when they didn't have beignets. The waiter gave me a weird look. Lol.
The food at eat. is fantastic. The food, even despite the fact that it's a little pricey, might get 5 stars by itself. . . My issue with eat. however, is how unwelcome I feel when I go there. I work nearby and have stopped by for lunch on a handful of occasions, never really loving the service, but my visit yesterday was the last straw. First, our table was given away after the hostess failed to step outside to call my name (the waiting area inside was full). Second, our order was never put in by the waitress and it wasn't until another server checked on us 30 minutes later that the food was finally prepared. Finally, when the food did arrive, one of our orders was wrong. At that point, we had both already gone over our allotted lunch hour, so my companion gave up and just ate what she had received. . . The server who noticed we never got food did apologize for the issue, but the original waitress who took the order never bothered to come by to apologize. Over an hour and half after our arrival we finally paid and left. I'll probably avoid going back with co-workers in the future - I can't keep taking such long lunch breaks. And I can't justify paying so much on a lunch at a place that doesn't seem to appreciate my business.
Shrimp and grits... nuf said!
Wow if you are in Vegas and want a great breakfast or lunch this is a must! Fantastic sandwiches and soup. I split a Rubin and it was just the right amount, I also split a Lettuce wedge. The blu cheese dressing was fantastic.  Please do yourself a favor and stop in for some great food!
Great food a must try while in Vegas!  Excellent breakfast! Everything here is fresh and it's a great escape from the buffet's or subpar food you will have while in Vegas.
I wanted to give this place a fair chance.  The food is good and  tad expensive,  $11 for a BLT with avocado a pickle and a choice of chips, potato salad or tomato soup.  Now I don't mind paying for the experience and food if it gave me that WOW factor.  However,  it is doubtful that I would make the trip down here again.   As a single diner I was passed up on a table that sat four people even though I was waiting prior to  the couple that was sat before me.  Apparently that  area is reserved for "larger parties" which I get, if it was in fact being made into a table to accommodate a large party.  However a two top was sat there instead of me.  Making me feel discriminated against.  I was then sat about five minutes later at a table that seats three.  When I brought the subject up with the manager I was told that is whatthe owner wants.  As another customer service individual I can be more understanding of a guest's feelings since it is all subjective and sometimes taken out of context.  But I will say this most of the other reviews are spot on with regards to poor customer service.  Guests make your business and to treat  a patron the way I was treated left me with a bad taste in my mouth that even the wonderful food could not take away.. . Just at add insult to injury as I left,  there was a single diner sitting on the side where the "large parties"  were supposed to sit!
By far my favorite place to eat in Vegas after living here for 8 months and trying so many new places. The vibe is cozy like a Seattle coffee shop, the food is divine, and the owner walks through the small dining area talking with guests. I love everything about this place. 5 stars all the way.
Delicious! Fantastic service. Came here MDW 2014 Saturday morning at 9:45am, seated for a party of 2 within 5 mins. They were already busy when we arrived. Right when we sat down, they asked if we wanted to ordered our drinks. Maybe less than 10 mins, waitress checked back to place our order for food:. . large orange juice- $6, it taste fresh, so I'm not sure if it's freshly squeezed or pre-made. . chicken fried steak- $14.  . Downtown eggs benedict $13-. . Side of turkey bacon $4. . Coffee $3
Iarrived at 2:24 and the new host told us the last seating was at 2:30. He made it seem as if it was already 2:30 and could not seat us. I asked for the high top table and he said that area is closed. Then the manager looked straight at him and said it's okay to seat them there. So minus one star for the new host. . . I ordered the free range chicken sandwich with a side green salad. The chicken was juicy, lettuce/tomatoes very fresh, and the bread was thick and tasted homemade. Only complaint was that I could not taste the pesto flavor in the pesto mayonnaise. . . The manager Marisa gave us a sample of their biscuits with strawberry compote. The biscuits were made well and had the right amount of sweetness vs saltiness. Marisa is a great manager and you can tell she enjoys her job.. . I wonder why they close at 3 on weekdays and 2 on weekends. I would think it would be the opposite because of the weekends being busier. . . All in all I can tell they take pride in their food and I can't wait to come back and try them for breakfast.
Excellent breakfast and lunch spot off the strip near downtown Las Vegas. This place has a very cool urban vibe. . . Showed up at10:45 on a Saturday of holiday weekend and the wait for two was quoted at 20 minutes, but really we were seated in about 10-15. . . Other reviewers mentioned that the chicken fried streak is only served until 11, however our server said it was available all day on their brunch menu. We had the chicken fried steak and the huevos montulenos. Each came with a hearty portion of country potatoes and the chicken fried steak came with toast. Do yourself a favor and ask for jelly. The strawberry jelly they brought was delicious and fresh. Both dishes were good and totally different so it's hard to pick a favorite between the two. I was surprised that I did enjoy the sweetness of the banana in the huevos montulenos. The banana and the peas are what made the dish unique. . . Overall a good meal and I highly recommend.. . Tip-the container park is right across the street and makes for a fun walk after your meal.
We usually eat breakfast at Egg & I but deciding to try this place.What lured us in were the pic of the beignets which we found out are actually no longer on the menu! WTF!..Talk about false advertising. ..Then what breakfast place worth its weight in gold doesn't serve freshly squeezed orange juice..Especially after a long night of dancing and drinking. THIS is essential. ... Small yet quait with indoor/outside seating and decent decor and ambiance but who really cares about that at breakfast. ..Good food, Freshly squeezed juice options and great service is how we judge our Breakfast  spots. Whats saves this joint is The Food...fresh ingredients and righteous spicing are key... So if you're ok with decent service, no freshly squeezed oj but good food (without the beignets). Definitely give this place a try, at least once..
FANTASTIC! In from out of town and saw the great reviews so we had to try it. The food and service was perfect. Don't miss out!
Dear hostess at Eat, thank you for wasting my lunch hour due to you incompetence. I gave the hostess my name and party size, shetold me it would 15 minutes. 30 minutes later I realize we still haven't been called. I go ask her how much longer and come to find out she never wrote down my name or party size. I left and will not be coming back.
Go a little joint in the new becoming artsy area in Downtown Vegas. it was cool to see the owner enjoying talks with her customers and since i read an article on her and her business i felt that was cool. i enjoyed there huge pancakes and food. totally recommend.
Breakfast time and it's time to EAT! . . Huevos Motulenos: hard tortilla base with beans, feta cheese, bananas and topped with over easy eggs smothered in a tomato base sauce and accompanied by potatoes. A dish that has a good balance of sweet (bananas) and savory. . . Shrimp and Grits: pretty much self explanatory, served with bacon strips, butterflied shrimp, topped with over easy eggs and homemade sauce. The eggs were something different but a nice touch. . . Biscuits with strawberry compote: biscuits that seemed to be baked with sugar and cinnamon for the crispy top smothered in a strawberry compote and topped with strawberries and blackberries. This was the highlight of our meal and it's a must get! It's usually served before the meal arrives. . . Overall great place to satisfy your breakfast hunger.
I was excited when I saw they had shrimp and grits! The grits werevery runny and then mixed with the egg it was a slimey texture that I couldn't handle. My shrimp and grits are so much better. The chicken posole was amazing! Seriously as good as it gets. The ruben was good but it didn't have that bite you would expect from the  sauerkraut but the bread was really good and the sandwich was HUGE. I'd go back for the posole and to try something else. I hear they have the best pancakes in town. I just need to get there a little earlier for that.
I would have given this a five stars because the food is beyond very good. The only drawback is the noise level inside if not too hot sit outside in the shade. We split the Eggs Benedict and the cinnamon biscuit strawberry capote, both great taste and flavor. I'm not a big fan of breakfast potatoes but these were great my wife didn't want the iced tea because it was flavored. I like it really well.. Paid parking on the street. Don't let this part of town scare you away from a great breakfast.
Jeez. Slap your momma good Mac and cheese and being from georgia that is comes with a lot of test trials
