This review is only for the lounge and not the restaurant. We stumbled upon this hidden lounge after coming out of the Michael Jackson show, loved it! We were initially thought it would be a little too pretentious, but we were so wrong.  The servers, bouncer and bartenders were all nice... either that or we were just too intoxicated to notice. The view is beautiful. The crowd tends to be on the older side of 30. Loved that the bartender was giving us girls double shots! Even the bathroom has a view...
Fantastic views and great service.  Food was good, but not the best I've had for the price.
This probably wouldn't have been a 5 star when we first sat down. As one obnoxious patron sat immediately behind us, loud, rude and nonstop yapping about how much money he spent. OMG!! there were two other outdoor tables, we all agreed, to throw him off the 60th floor!  Thanks to our wonderful server "Jonathan" who saved us. Got rid of Mr. Stupid...so everyone can enjoy the ridiculous gorgeous view of Vegas. Not a cloud in the sky, staring at the pyramid, etc...It was picture perfect with "THE Hotel" glistening in the back. The ride up and down the elevator was just as fun but if you are afraid of height, hold your breath! and i def do not recommend sitting outdoor.. . Some food porn:. Seared Foie Gras (yes, first thing on my mind the moment i landed in NV!). Charcuterie Sampler (everything you expect and love from cured flavors and pickle). Slow baked Halibut (HUGE portion and it's sooooo tender and sweet, buttery veggies). Endless pour of Pinot Gri and S. Blanc!!!. Had two glasses of the yummiest, sweet mix flavor of coconut and strawberry mousse cocktails. Biscuits dipped in hot melty chocolate!. . Can't wait to return....
Came for the View stayed for Service!. . I had some friends in town for the weekend so we decided to go up to The Mix for some drinks and to check the view. We ordered a round from the bar and took a walk around to find a seat. . . We were promptly approached by a well dressed young gentleman by the name of Richard. He was presentable, professional and well spoken . He sold us a bottle of Grey Goose vodka in the VIP section of the balcony with the best view in the house. . . Not long after we were seated the bottle came out with all of the mixers of our choice. The lovely cocktail waitress Amber took care of us and was always on hand to make sure our drinks were topped up and to take photos. . . Richard dropped in and checked on our group periodically throughout the night to talk to us, make us feel welcome and make sure we were taken care of. An example of his fine Hosting skills came into play when one of my girlfriends felt a little cold. Richard went out of his way to get her a blanket to throw over her legs so she was comfortable. . . I can't say enough about the way we were hosted by Richard and actually treated like VIP's. It's subtle differences I noticed that made a big difference in our experience. From creating an atmosphere where we felt like we where special, important and comfortable to genuinely taking an interest in our conversations and catering to our needs, we were all very impressed to say the least . . Words got around about our experience. I now have some more friends coming into town over the next few months and have requested to hit up the Mix for a night out hosted by Richard. We will be back for sure!
What happened to the top 40 dance "fun" music????   Mix was a go to favorite on the weekends to party with friends and dance the night away!! The vibe was great the bartenders are fun and energetic!!  Now the mood is somber and the new music is no Bueno.  The go to favorite is a "go to SLEEP" not so favorite ANYMORE...  . . PLEASE DON'T STOP THE MUSIC!!!  . . As the saying goes... if it ain't broke... don't fix it!!
Went to MIX about a month ago, been going there for years.  I still had a good time, but the new music was awful.  It really brought down the experience.  I used to really like everything about MIX - great views, awesome bar/service, and fun music.  It made more of a difference than I thought.  It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth...
Very pleasant experience.  Service was awesome and very very friendly.  Food tasted great.  prices are high, but work it.  The ambiance is superb and the view from the top of The Hotel is amazing.. . Highly recommend for a quite night of fine dining.
A wonderful dinner experience at this beautiful restaurant! Everything was PERFECT! We have been to the lounge before, it was fun, and the dining experience this time was even better! . . The elevator to Mix restaurant and lounge was scary, it was meant for dining people to see some amazing views on the way up, too bad I am scared of height. Passed through Mix lounge, lovely host girl let us choose a window booth or a bird nest booth, was it a bird nest? Or half egg shell? Either one I guess, I liked the bird nest, it was more private, comfy and fun.. . We brought our own Perrier JOUET champagne, our server put it in the ice to cool it down. I ordered a raspberry lemon drop martini to sip on while we were looking through the menu, very clean and simple menu, I could tell every single item on the menu must be so good. And I was right, the dishes we tried were AMAZING! . . Starters: . Complimentary bread basket: assorted breads with butter and peanut butter, very delicious, loved the peanut butter! . . Shrimp cocktail: non traditional shrimp cocktail, it was like a salad, jumbo shrimps were so fresh and tender, they tasted so good with the tomato sauce on the bottom, the sauce was so flavorful and delicious! . . Broccoli soup: clean flavor, with a hint of cheese in it, it was yummy. . . Entrees:. Lobster curry: one of their signature dishes, our server's favorite, he said he didn't even like curry, neither am I, but the curry flavor was fantastic! It was not heavy, just rich and flavorful, small amount of coconut to add a hint of spice, tender lobster meat with exotic flavors, it was MAGICAL, I loved it so much! . . Filet mignon with jalapeno pepper: the first cut came out overcooked to medium, they changed another one for hubby, the second one was a perfect medium rare, bloody and juicy, exactly what hubby liked. The red wine sauce was so good, the jalapeno was extremely spicy, server said it was from Santa Monica, most of them aren't spicy, guess hubby just got lucky to have a super spicy one on his plate, but both of us love spicy flavor, we didn't mind. Hubby loved his steak so much. . . Sauteed mushrooms: with housemade creamy sauce, delicious mushrooms, the flavors were so strong. . . From appetizers to entrees, the food was amazing! The flavors were heavenly delicious! Chef worked magical exotic flavors on each dish, how did he do that?! Just WOW!. . Drinks:. Our Perrier champagne was so tasty, loved it, the raspberry lemon drop was strong and yummy, Chef's complimentary coconut and passion fruit souffle was very very tasty, I usually don't like coconut flavor, what happened that night, how did I come to like curry and coconut flavors? . . After so much rich and flavorful food, I had no room for desert, the portions were big, both hubby and I got so full. Chef made us mini cakes with hot fudge as a little treat, just to apologize for overcooking hubby's steak, they were yummy. Hubby had double shot of espresso to finish this lovely dinner, I had the rest of the champagne by myself as usual. . . Definitely one of the best dining experience I have ever had for a very long time! The restaurant was beautiful, the views were amazing, the food was spectacular, the service was flawless, it was just PERFECT! Worth every penny of the $300 tab! The cork fee was $35. . . Mix has just become one my favorite restaurants in Vegas, along with Comme Ca and Circo. I think I've just had my next Vegas trip dinner dates lined up, that's awesome! . . Ps. The lounge next door offers champagne bottle service on the patio, it's a great place to enjoy the night views of Las Vegas while sipping on champagne, very romantic and relaxing.
This review is just for the lounge... . Ladies called and we going out for dranks! Came for a comp bottle and the views are gorgeous from the top! There is outdoor seating however we were seated inside. There were about nine of us so it was a tight squeeze for the table we were at.. Ended up just taking stools from the table next to us. . It wasn't very busy either but it was great. Loved it!. . Update: I did come for HH one evening with a couple of coworkers. We were seated outside a d enjoyed the great views and sampled various foods off their HH menu. Everything was really good especially the Shrimp Cocktail thingy! I highly recommend it!!
Beautiful restaurant!  Nice ambience, great view, & wonderful service.  I got the Seared Bass with a side of cream spinach which was pretty good, 4/5 stars.
