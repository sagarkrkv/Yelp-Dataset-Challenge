Wow, what a meal. To top it off, the service was excellent. Loved getting popcorn instead of bread as I was waiting and the burgers. The burgers! They were out of this world. The combo of real good beef, cheese, fresh bread and all the goodness was awesome! . . Was here for a work conference and had to go here twice. I could have gone to the wicked spoon but who wants a buffet and you can get a wholesome real burger!
This may seem strange getting a 5 star review to a burger joint from a vegan. They offer the best house made vegan burger I have ever tasted. It is called the Urth burger and vegans and non-vegans alike will love the flavor and texture. I also ordered the vegan raspberry coconut bamboozled shake. It is just like it sounds, a delicious shake full of booze. The shake was so large that it made almost 2 whole shakes so I shared it with my sister.I will absolutely be back on my next visit. All you vegans out there need to eat here!
Holsteins is a must visit when anywhere near the Cosmo.  The burgers are lovely and the beer selection will please anyone looking for "something light and different" to go with the heavy-ish fare. . . I've visited the place three times now while in Vegas on business and have not been disappointed. As is the case in Vegas... the service is efficient although slightly oblivious in that  the wait staff will put their own priorities in the busy restaurant, above interrupting you mid sentence to "check if everything is okay"... but they do check - and the place is always nuts... so I can't really fault it.. . I've tried a couple of the burgers and they were quite artful. Had the sliders and milkshakes after an exhausting four day conference and they totally hit home. Yum!. . Two of my visits were with large groups and everyone was pleased with their meals. This was all a few months ago so I don't have specific recommendations for the food for you... but our orders were pretty diverse.. . The place is super loud and it's a kind of upper-mid-scale-Vegas-Tourist atmosphere. I use the word Tourist because the clientele diversity ranged from families with kids, to frat boys... and despite that, the meal was enjoyable and while the slightly lower scale service was a slight annoyance... It was forgivable given that I was on a business trip with colleagues.. . Good for groups of friends looking for excellent burgers, beer and interesting soft-drinks.. . Not somewhere I'd ever bring a date to... but that's just me. ;)

Another concept restaurant from Block 16 Hospitality that has generated raves since its inception at The Cosmopolitan I'd frequently entertained a visit to Holsteins but it was not until nearly three and a half years after first visiting the property that I finally sat down for lunch, a $130 meal for two at a casual 'shakes and buns' place rather absurd in retrospect even though much of the experience was admittedly quite good.  Large, loud, and sceney on its own and all the more so with Marquee launching its dayclub across the way it was amongst the sunkissed and scantily clad that we entered Holsteins at the eleven o'clock opening hour and led to a large table with views of both the televised NHL playoffs as well as the crowd our meal began promptly with buttered popcorn and water as effusively friendly and efficient service guided us through the new spring menu.  Not particularly fond of burgers myself but willing to share in the setting of other selections it was with a duo of creamy, boozed-up shakes alongside four underwhelming hushpuppies that tasted neither of shrimp nor spicy pork that our order kicked-off and progressing at a good pace as the dining crowd swelled it was not long before the second wave arrived; the $17 pasta hilariously overpriced given the dearth of lobster and small size but both the belly on bao and burger truly delicious - the later a perfect medium with great balance and texture derived from impeccable accoutrements including the melting avocado.  Never one to skimp on sweets, particularly in belated celebration of my friend's birthday, it was with the new "Un-Birthday" cake that our meal concluded and featuring layers of dense cake juxtaposing smooth frosting in a portion large enough for four suffice it to say that the $15 charge is warranted, a rarity on any Block 16 menu.
This place was great!! Handsome and I came here during our stay at The Cosmopolitan for lunch. Handsome got the Oreo Shake and I got the Fat Boy Shake. Both were so yum but really filling! I ordered the Nom Nom Burger and Handsome got the Gold Standard Burger. They were just delicious! Cooked perfectly medium rare. So juicy and tasty. The fries were crisp and wonderful. I am so happy we decided to go here it was a perfect choice for lunch.
Love this place! We are local and eat here weekly if we can. The Fungi burger and Steakhouse burgers are killer. The meat on that Steakhouse is just unparalleled. These were my staples until I tried the Rising Sun, which was the best burger I've had in my life. The Oreo shake is good. They have really good sweet potato fries and onion rings. Good for a kid-friendly place on the strip. Good service. Also, you never have to wait too long.. If you're debating between BurGR and Holstein's, BurGR has much longer waits, not as good service, and it's harder to get to (if you drive your car). The burgers are comparable with a little more refinement going to BurGR. However, BurGR has better fries (truffle) and shakes - OMG BurGR has good shakes, really more like dessert.. If you want a quick bite or have kids, Holstein's is your best bet.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!. Super fun, relaxed atmosphere- great place to stop by for a late lunch after an afternoon at the pools. Even better if you fit in a morning workout, because the food is even more glorious without the food-coma-associated-guilt. . . Service: Attentive and very helpful. . SPIKED SHAKES: Amazing. Can personally recommend Birthday Cake, Cereal Bowl, and Drunken Monkey. What's even more amazing is how good the vegan cinnamon pecan shake was. . You really can't go wrong with any of the burgers (and as far as the sides go, I'm usually a sweet potato fry fan, but their onion rings came out on top!). Our group also may have ordered a second round of the crispy pork belly buns to take home.. I can't wait to go back and try a few more of the "nosh" items (small plates/apps)- poke tostadas or buffalo chicken dip, anyone?
Burger was dry and my bun was soggy which they fixed after I flagged down another server.  Missed my free beer in the four square checkin (my fault for doing it after I paid).  Fries are greasy and limp.  Seats were dirty with crumbs.  My gf loved her farmers salad though.
Burger lovers rejoice! Holsteins combines American flavors with a twist of creativity. I tried the Drunken Monkey shake which was delicious but extremely thick. If you plan to have a full meal you may want to share the shake, there is only so much room in one's stomach. . . An added bonus was the movie style popcorn for free. I ordered el machete burger which I definitely recommend. I wish I could have had more of the side french fries because they tasted like salty goodness. . . I also couldn't help but love the cute cartoon pigs dressed as cows!
Awesome beer selection, delicious boozy milkshakes, tasty/meaty burgers, and lobster mac n'cheese! Service was quick and friendly. Prices were reasonable. I definitely will be back here.
I love this place! This is located near the Marquee Day Club, so it's a perfect location to grab a bite to eat after an afternoon out in the sun. And if you had a couple drinks already, it makes the food here just that much better.. . Their burger was really really good. I devoured it just like that. We also got the bacon wrapped peppers, and some tacos (I forgot off the top of my head what it was exactly), but I remember it was really tender. Super yummy! They also had popcorn for us too. How sweet is that? . . I will definitely come back again, and I'll update my review after.
Anyone who knows me, knows how much I'm a sucker for burgers. Ever since I moved to Vegas I've been on the hunt for a great burger joint. Holsteins comes very close to hitting the mark. I've tried about 4 different burgers from here (Rising Sun, Gold Standard) but I must say the Nomnom Burger & Billionaire Burger were my favorite. So tender and tasty. Now that's a burger! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. So the fries, meh. I could do without those. Funny, it seems difficult to find a place that has great burgers AND fries. I mean come on, you can't really enjoy one without the other. Am I right? Before my visit, I scrolled through some pictures on yelp I noticed the thick cut fries. Mama like! Imagine my disappointment to hear they no longer have those on the menu, boo! Anywho, the onion rings are good and the shakes are pretty standard. Order a bamboozled shake if you need a little "pick me up" Hey, it's happy hour somewhere. :) The service has always been great, even with larger parties. So bring your friends, appetite and don't forget your wallet! These burgers are not for the frugal foodie.
Delicious vegan burgers and amazing flavors!  Went here twice during my Vegas trip :). . Delicious vegan burgers! I also loved how you can still get the vegan patty (or whichever patty you want) and then you can go with the other toppings. I tried the Urth burger and it was yummy but my favorite was the truffle mushroom burger with the vegan patty. Yum!. . Definitely come by. My friends who ordered the regular burgers LOVED them. One of my friends got the banana cream pie shake and we all tried it. One word: WOW!  If you plan on getting one, leave room...it is large and they give you the extra that won't fit in the glass in a separate steel cup.  I was impressed that they gave my friend the rest of her shake in a plastic cup so she could drink it later.  Gotta love Vegas!  . . Excellent food and location.  You can't beat that! Two thumbs up!
I was skeptical in trying Holsteins because of the mixed reviews, but after eating at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR so much, I wanted a different burger place. Originally we came here around midnight Fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11PM. They offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers/shakes). No biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at Marquee's dayclub...Spoiler alert: We also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was SOOO GOOD!!. . The decor is so cute here w/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w/ the Cosmopolitan. Our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt/sweet popcorn. My bf killed that thing, talk about drunk munchies. . Bamboozled Shakes:. Drunken Monkey - I added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! The description/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. It was like a cookies n cream reese's coconut shake. This was my fav out of all the other shakes. . . Tiramisu - They had me at mascarpone ice cream. I LOVE mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. This tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso/coffee flavor. . . Banana Creme Pie - My bf go this 'cause he loves bananas and I would say this was my 2nd fav shake. It tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w/ chocolate. I liked that they topped it w/ white chocolate covered bananas.. . The shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. I like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w/ a spoon (yum!) I also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!. . Apps:. Surf 'n Turf Quesadilla - DELISH my favorite app! This ain't no taco bell quesadilla. It was crunchy and not oily at all. The lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w/ flavor. MUST ORDER!!. . Soft Shell Crab Bruschetta - For a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. The softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshing. . Crispy Calamari - big enough portion to share, I couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. I like that they don't overbread the calamari rings. . Maine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster. . . Crispy pork belly bun - Tasted better than the ones at Ramsay's BurGR. The steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot on. . Burgers:. Rising Sun w/ onion rings(normally comes w/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - THE BEST BURGER EVER!! Most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. It didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. Everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. THIS IS what a burger should taste like! The whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. I am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. The tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. You could taste each item in the burger and they all blended well together. The KOBE beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. Onion rings were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! They were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR BUTTERMILK RANCH TO DIP THE ONION RINGS IN!! It tastes so divine. . Fun-Ghi on WHEAT BUN w/ salad ($2 extra) - Healthy combo huh? My 2nd fav burger, but my bf preferred this over Rising sun because he prefers the truffle flavor. Again, patty was cooked perfect along w/ toasted wheat bun. I actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. The burger wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! The gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. Salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w/ lemon). The only negative is that we added a fried egg to the burger, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(. . Gold Standard w/ sweet potato fries- Everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to Rising Sun. Sweet potato fries were bomb!. . I would have to say that Holstein's outranks Ramsay's BurGR. We were so pleased w/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. We were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. The food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. Don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!. . Note: Try and get a girl server. The first day we had a girl and she was totally on top of it. The 2nd day, we had a guy and he seemed easily overwhelmed
Holsteins shakes are like a spiked milkshake ! They have really great creations and they were so good ! I recommend the Frozen Grasshopper or the Drunken Monkey. These are delicious !!! . . From there, we went on and had a few apps on the menu. The Lobster Mac and Cheese, Lobster rolls, sliders, and the bruschetta. Everything was AMAZING except for the crab bruschetta. Took a small bite and passed the plate. The only think I would say about this is that the bartender didn't take it off our bill. We did state that it was not good and shouldn't be recommended to people but it's an $18 app so I guess upselling is where this came in. I'm going to continue on how great everything else was though. The Lobster Mac and Cheese and Lobster Rolls were dynamite ! The size of actual lobster in these small plates were terrific and so so good ! The mini sliders were great too ! The staff and bartender we had was really nice ! . . Highly recommend this place ! At least if you're passing by, just go for the shakes !
Been there twice and LOVE it.  What more cold you want? Awesome burgers and alcoholic milk shakes.  Plus, you get to enjoy the Cosmo too!  Win-win!
As a vegas local, I love trying new places... I took stars away mainly for service. I booked a reservation for 2 at 8:15.. showed up a bit earlier and they quickly seated us. I asked for a water with lemon and a few moments to look over the menu. Water came back with no lemon. I got a very weird vibe from our waitress, like we annoyed her. I ordered the classic medium rare with American cheese and onion rings. My burger came back and when I cut the burger in half.. blood came out of the patty.. Definitely not medium rare, this was rare beyond belief. Since i was starving I did not want to make a commotion and send it back. Despite the patty being undercooked, the onion rings were delicious. My date had french fries and those were so good. If this review was strictly based on food I would give it 4 stars, minus one for the undercooked beef patty. The portions are enough to fill you up, and it had a casual atmosphere. I will go back, probably just ask for a medium cooked hamburger instead.. . **reading other reviews, we did not get the complimentary popcorn either, that's a little disappointing.
Damn good burgers although the service isn't the greatest. Even after a half hour wait I would have given the place 5 stars if the server hadn't had such a bad attitude. Luckily that was changed after I spoke with the manager and suggested that if they couldn't supply the customer a Cosmopolitan due to their "being out of supplies to make one" (!?!), they might want to allow the customer to bring their Cosmopolitan that was purchased 50 feet away from the door at the Chandelier bar for $15 into the restaurant that is located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel and casino without a complaint that it's "against policy to bring outside beverages into our establishment".
Went the lobster mac and cheese, and the lobster rolls. . Both were perfect sizes to have both, along with a massive glass of coke with lots of ice in my hungover vegas state! . . Service was pretty good, there was only one other table when I first got in (at open at 11am on a Thursday).. . Only problem is the price - like everything in the Cosmo it's pretty privy for what it is. I'd still go back though it was that tasty!. . Fun Fact - also like the rest of the Cosmo, the art in here is really cool!
My husband and I have been to Holsteins before and while on the strip with out of town friends decided to head over for a good burger. We knew that Memorial Day weekend would be busy and were  prepared for a wait. What we were not prepared for was the horrible service and attitude from our server. I can say without thinking twice that it was the worst service experience I have had on the strip ever.  . . We sat in the bar area to circumvent the long dining room wait time. A busser came by and immediately wiped down the table and set it up. Another 25 minutes went by without our table getting waters or being acknowledged by our server. The busser came by and noticed we hadn't been helped and decided to take our orders and get our drinks.  We got our waters and then the server finally decided to come to our table only to tell us with an attitude no less that they did not have most of the things required for our drink orders. This happened twice more before we all resolved to sticking with waters. We did not see our server again until it was time for the check. . . The busser, Eric, was basically our server.  He took our orders, brought our orders, and checked on us in between. He went above and beyond his job description. The 2 times we saw we saw our server (to tell us they couldn't make drinks and to drop a check ) Emily, we were subjected to her non-apologetic, horrible attitude. Accordingly, our whole generous tip was given to the busser who actually worked for it and saved the experience from being a complete disaster. . . The food was very good but was hard to enjoy given the lacking service.  It was a disappointing experience in a city that resolves around the service industry. I highly doubt we will return or recommend Holsteins to friends.
The sweet potato fries get a thumbs up, Holstein's special lager was nice. Wayne loved his Urth burger. They pushed the gold standard burger, which placed a distant fourth. I'd advise sticking with Kobe beef. Service was meh.
I ordered the blackened salmon po' boy, which ended up being a mistake. I should have ordered a burger. My wife did and it looked delicious. The po' boy was unfortunately dry and extremely messy. The fries that accompanied it were OK. I'm not a fan of steak fries due to their sogginess. Instead, I prefer crispier, thinner fries. I  wish there had been a second option. But, if you are a fan of soggier fries, you will probably like these.. . The service was actually quite good. I was drinking water like crazy, and my glass was always refilled promptly before I could even ask. My only regret is that I did not take the waiter's recommendations, since my meal was somewhat lackluster.. . I'd give this place another chance. My bad for trying to opt for something healthier at a burger joint, I suppose. . . Also, being next to the entrance to Marquee, this place can get pretty loud. So, if loud crowds bother you, you should be aware for that.
I've stayed at the Cosmo several times and I always stop by here, it can get pretty crowded around peak times, but anything worth doing in Vegas is the same. . . The Food:. The last time I was here I had the philly eggroll and the Nom Nom burger. The Philly eggroll was actually really tasty and flavorful and I would definitely get it again. The Nom Nom burger (burger with chips and cheese inside) was on the salty side for me.. . The Highlight:. The highlight of this place every single time is the milkshakes. Whether you get them alcoholic or non-alcoholic, they are absolutely delicious. I tried the drunken monkey, the banana cream pie, and the fat boi, and they are all soooooo good. I only wish they were only 24/7 so I can grab one after leaving the club. Thumbs up!
OMG THE ABSOLUTE BEST! If you're ever in Vegas and on the strip, stop by Cosmo and GO TO HOLSTEINS. . . Our waitress was impeccable and the best. I wish I'd gotten her name because she deserves a raise!! Best customer service ever!. . PROS: . -burgers were cooked to absolute perfection and to the way we wanted.. -shakes were to die for. foodgasm to the max. . -fries were crispy and perfect.. . Overall, it was one of the best hamburgers I'd ever tasted and the best experience all in one. No doubt whenever I'm in Vegas I will make a stop at Holsteins!
Food is phenomenal hands down one of the best burger places. We go here every time  we come to Vegas . . However I don't know if we will ever go back. My wife got a big ass hair in her burger bun...which was just the start. Then our waiter Fabrizio (yeah that was his real name) decides to overcharge us on our credit card, and luckily one of us caught it. When we told the manager he simply said "sorry it happens" and revised the bill. All in all super unprofessional staff and shotty service outweigh the delicious burgers.
Quick little spot next to marquee! Good food and good service-- let alone our server is kute!
