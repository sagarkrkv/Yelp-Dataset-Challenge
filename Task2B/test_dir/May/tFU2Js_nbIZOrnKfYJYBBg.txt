I have been wanting to dine at Bouchon forever and a day. Didn't get reservations at the Yountville location when we visited Napa Valley a couple of years ago. I guess with the availability of ample restaurant options in Las Vegas, it is easier to find a reservation at the Las Vegas location.. . We stayed at the Venetian during our visit to Las Vegas and while strolling by, ran into Bouchon. I didn't even know there was Bouchon at Las Vegas until that time. With no second thought, I immediately went inside and made a reservation for dinner on the very same day.. . There is both indoor and outdoor seating area; each is beautiful in its own way. The indoor seating area has dim lights and very subtle and classy decor. The outdoor seating area is next to the pool.. . We were served complimentary bread and butter. So delish. We skipped the appetizers and went straight to the main course.. - Steak Frites (It comes with fries by default; since I usually like mashed potatoes with steak, I asked them to substitute my fries with mashed potatoes. - Gigot d'Agneau. . Both the dishes were delicious. Especially, the sauce that came with the lamb dish, ahhhh! Mouth watering. Al though we wanted to wind up the meal with a dessert, there was no room in our stomachs.. . A classy dining at Bouchon. Loved it!
Seth was my server he was the absolute best! Extremely attentive and super friendly, he made my first experience dining here excellent! I had the crab cake Benedict off the brunch menu it was SO delicious I definitely recommend getting. I can't wait to come back!
Our second Thomas Keller experience. Absolutely lovely and delicious. The food and presentation was perfection. I had the crab cake benedict, my husband had the baked chicken and waffle.  The service was great, we had a table of 9. Everyone was delighted.
I have stayed at the venetian several times and have never passed by when this place was open, but today it was and we had breakfast there and I am so glad it was open. The restaurant is beautiful it's nice and open, the service is great and the food is the best. My husband had the omelette of the day which had a nice spicy bacon in it. I ordered the quiche du jour which was just spinach but this was the absolute best quiche I have ever had. And it came with some nice greens on the side. I also had a Bellini which was good and we grabbed some macarons after which are huge and a good solid macaron, the caramel and coffee are my favorites, after eating them I immediately found myself googling how close the bouchon is in Beverly Hills so I can send my husband to get me more of those two on his way home from work one day.  The best part is the prices are not completely outrageous, so if you're looking for a great breakfast experience, this is the place.
Really bad food. We ordered their "special"  of the day which was the lobster hash and a quiche. The lobster really chewy and smelled really fishy. They wouldn't accommodate a fried egg on top of the hash instead of scrambled either. The quiche was cold in the center and seemed like it was reheated in the microwave. We asked to get something different instead and ordered a cobb salad and blueberry muffin which we hoped would be safer choices, but alas, they were not. The salad was really small for a $17 dollar salad and really gross chunks of bacon fat in it. The blueberry muffin appeared as if it had been microwaved as well and was dried out. Lunch was practically inedible and with all of our complaints a manager never so much as looked out way. We were extremely dissapointed!. . Oh also water is $7 and they won't tell you there is a charge until you get the bill!
The madam croquet was absolutely delicious. You absolutely must try it, brunch or dinner!! Our waiter, Jeremy I believe, was wonderful. He was attentive, helpful and went out of his way to help us. I wish more servers were as good as him.
I just realized I had not reviewed this place, our visit was from 2010 for dinner and 2013 for breakfast. Breakfast was blah...my toast was burnt to crisp and when they burn brioche it is like eating dust! My son in law had croque Monsieur and liked his but my daughter did not like the hash at all. . Dinner was too long ago to remember specifics but one funny thing happened on the way there. We always dress nice for dinner and we were coming down in the elevator of the Paris hotel and there was a guy in there dressed casually in jeans and button down shirt. He commented on how nice we all looked and when we said we were going to dinner he said oh must be some fancy place. We just smiled. Well a little while later when we arrive at Bouchon who should be in the line in front of us but the same guy from elevator dressed in jeans ready to eat!!  So don't bother dressing up for this place! . Service was excellent both times we were there.
Love the tuna melt with apple bits in it. My go to breakfast place in SF!
So delicious!. . The wait staff there is very knowledgeable about the food and the cooking process and you get five star service.  . . This place is a dream for foodies.  Seriously, if you are a foodie and you don't go here while in Vegas you are missing out.. . Its fairly expensive but definitely worth the experience.  The food is really a work of art and so delicious.
I am really disappointed in you Buchon! I've dined here many times (at least 6+) while staying at the Venetian and the Palazzo, never a problem. . . During my trip to Vegas in March I was excited to go back to Buchon, and to bring friends who had never been before. After hearing me rav about the great food and service, the bar had been set. We had an 7:30pm reservation on a Wednesday night, showed up right on time, and it was packed, not to mention LOUD! I honestly do not remember it ever being so loud here before, we could barely hear the hostess when we were talking to her. . . Our table wasn't ready, and we asked for as quiet of a table as possible, given the noise level. We had to wait about 10 minutes and when we were finally sat down, we had to have been placed at the loudest table in the restaurant- we were a table of 2 in the middle of 3 tables of 6 each. Needless to say, we were not happy, but we were hungry, so we stayed. . . Our waiter was much more interested in the larger groups around us, than in paying any attention to us, so because of that we had no less than 4 different waiters through out the night, one of whom I think was actually a manager. We were served water and bread/nuts right away, but waited about 25mins for a server (not the one that introduced himself to us) to finally took our drink order. Since we were afraid this new server might not come back, we ordered our drinks, apps, and entrees all at the same time- also worth mentioning, after a long day of flying, we were famished and told the waiter we would like to eat as quickly as possible! . . I ordered an Absinthe (my go to pre-dinner drink any time I'm at a decidedly French establishment). I should've changed my order to wine when the server (now possibly the manager??) asked me to repeat my order ("Absinthe please. ABSINTHE! A_B_S_I_N_T_H_E!!") 3 times, including spelling it once, and she still looked REALLY confused. . . It took 30 minutes for our apps to arrive, and they still arrived prior to our drinks, which is a big service flaw for me- drinks ALWAYS first, not to mention the crazy wait times. Terrible. The apps were terrible escargot with puffed pastry that was super dry, oily, and flavorless followed by flavorless onion soup. It literally tasted like warm, oily water and the cheese was rubbery.. . The drinks finally came (my friend had a glass of Merlot, and then of course my "Absinthe"), and the Manager lady prepared my drink for me- water, sugar, absinthe- you know the routine. Well, apparently she didn't, because her ratio was way off, and when I told her to stop adding water, she admitted that this was her first time serving/mixing absinthe. And it showed. . . It was by far the worst drink of my trip, and hands down worst absinthe I've had anywhere in the world. Just nasty. I took two sips and didn't bother to finish it. Had we had a good waiter, or ANY waiter, they would've surely noticed, and asked if there was a problem. . . We finally got our entrees about 1.5hrs after we sat down (An hour after our apps were cleared- no servers checked in with us at all during that time). We were so hungry at this point, that we literally lost our desire to eat. It was just a running joke- you ask for a quiet table, you get the loudest one there. You ask for quick service, you get the worst service ever. . . Then we looked down and realized we never got replacement silverware after our appetizers, so we couldn't eat our $50 entrees even if we had wanted to. Since we had no waiter to check on us, it took another 10 minutes to flag down the water guy to bring us silverware. Such a debacle. . . So by this time our entrees were luke warm at best, and we forced them down. We had such a sour taste after the terrible service all night, we literally just wanted to get out of the restaurant as quickly as possible. . . It took another 35mins once we were done eating to flag someone down to bring us a check, at which point we were so frustrated we couldn't help but start laughing. Luckily we had cash, because we were afraid paying by credit card would take another hour of our night. We paid and ran out of there, totally disappointed by what used to be a GREAT restaurant. I was totally embarrassed as I was the one that suggested Bouchon, and I can guarantee you I will never be back, nor will I ever recommend this place again. Terrible evening, and a waste of WAY too many hours.
A few years ago when I ate here I would have given 5 stars but tonight the place was just OK. The service was so off that our cocktails came after our salad and the wine didn't arrive until my husband had finished his meal. Add to that - my salmon was overcooked and the leeks were raw. Thomas  Keller should be ashamed to have his name on this. I know I would be.
This is one of those places that it really pays to ask the waiter for suggestions rather than agonizing and sort of guessing at what's best.   Weekday seating is fairly easy to get a table without much fuss.  You absolutely need to make a reservation on the weekends, or you will likely wait an hour or longer.. . The highlight's here are definitely the pastries and the corned beef hash, which is fantastic.  The pastry basket is very reasonably priced for a set of four nice pastries, and they let you choose. ASK THE WAITER, they know which are the freshest/best and will make some nice suggestions, even if you decide there are a couple you don't want to miss.  The specials and some of the other items are hit or miss.  Recently, they had a lobster hash which I found to be a little underwhelming with the scrambled egg, I think it might have actually been better as a cheaper crab hash, to be honest.   A few of the other items (I've eaten here 4 times):. . Quiche:  This is a rotating flavor of the day/week.  I'm always in a group of 3-4 and we split one of these,  twice it was Florentine which was underwhelming and fairly boring, tbh. . . Bourbon French Toast: Just think bread pudding, not french toast, because that is what this is.  This was solidly good but not spectacular.. . Corned Beef Hash:  Order this.  It's awesome.. . Pork Loin:  Another highlight, I know you're going to read this and think "ham and eggs" basically, but the smokiness of the loin was fantastic with the eggs, and you probably haven't had a piece like this.. . Mussels:  Really good thing to split if you have a group.  . . Pastries: They usually have a special pastry or two (apple danish last time I was there), the plain croissant is better than the chocolate croissant, but really you can't go wrong in general with what you order here.
I was really not impressed when I ate here.  The restaurant is set up really cute, with the raw bar on display.  I thought the food was going to be good, but I was really pretty disappointed.. . I got the steak frites cooked medium rare.  The steak wasn't particularly well cooked, didn't have much flavor, and my biggest gripe about it was that it didn't have any sort of sear on the outside of the steak, it was just kind of mushy all around.  It's really pretty expensive which makes sense considering it's in a nice hotel in vegas, but the food was just not good.. . I would definitely not come again, and I expected much more from a Thomas Keller restaurant.
Food was 3.5 stars. For the price I would expect far better quality and larger quantities. I ordered the leg of lamb and it came out as three small 1/4 inch thick slices of lamb, probably 5 oz total. I asked the server if that was the leg of lamb since I would expect an actual leg, and she said yes, would I like anything else. Not impressed for $35, although it tasted good. . . Service was 2 stars. They were too busy to really serve our table. We had a fairly large group as there were 10 of us, but we did make reservations so they obviously knew. Servers were flustered and several times said, yes they would be right there and they wouldn't come back since they either forgot or we're too busy. Starters came out at different times, took forever to take our order, didn't get entrees for two hours after we sat down. People kept saying, where the heck is our food???  . . Overall I give Bouchon a 2.5+ so a 3 on yelp. Food tasted good but nothing else was up to par.
Great food and especially great service! We had the brunch special, lobster benedict, great but a bit too spicy for my taste. Also their cocktails are great but on the small side. Eat on their terrasse if you can!
Food was delicious, best meal we had in Vegas - fantastic bread, salads, and steak frites! Great atmosphere, private setting away from casino. Would have given it five stars were it not for the service - our waitress was so constantly pushing us to add pricy additions to our meal. When you're already spending $70 a head, you want someone professional, not someone trying to squeeze more dollars out of your wallet. Overall, though, highly recommended dinner spot
I am the biggest fan of Bouchon Bakery. Their food is high-quality, unique, and very decadent. However, when dining at the Bouchon Restaurant at Venetian, I was disappointed in my meal and will not be returning.. . The staff was nice, as expected at a higher-end brunch spot. However, the food is incredibly sub-par. My party ordered: . -Cobb Salad: completely ordinary; the chicken was fairly dry, the dressing was very standard, as if out of a bottle; the avocado was extremely limited, and the portion was quite far from generous (even for a higher-end restaurant). -Mixed Greens Salad: once again ordinary. -Fruit Salad: fresh fruit, can't go wrong!. . Unfortunately, the food did not spark my interest at all. And despite the polite staff, their menu was below expectations.
I had a craving for French cuisine while in Vegas and Bouchon did not disappoint. I was excited to see that the Croque Madame was available on the dinner menu, since I had seen the pictures on Yelp and had hoped to try it. The Madame was delicious!. . Among the other dishes we ordered, the salmon appetizer stood out. The service was very prompt. We never had to ask for more bread to go with the salmon spread, it just continued to arrive. . . While I felt the wine list was a bit small, I was happy with the Chardonnay that we ordered. It was rich, buttery and paired well with the dishes we ordered. . . I would definitely return and recommend Bouchon to others.
There's no shortage of pricey, delicious restaurants by big name chefs in the Vegas.  So what makes Bouchon so special?  Your partners in dining are there on purpose.  It's not right off the strip like many of its restaurant peers.  At those places, you could be dining near people who are a fan of the food, people who just happen to walk by or people carrying an oh-so-classy yard glass.  Not Bouchon.  You have to work to get to Bouchon.  It's deep in the Venetian.  But it's worth every wrong turn you might make on your way there.. . If it's not horribly muggy, sit outside by the garden pool.  The ambiance is a 10.. . Also.  The service?  The best I've ever had.  In the history of ever.. . And do yourself a favor and don't bother getting the pommes frites sans truffles.  Upgrade and you won't be disappointed.
Holy camoly.. . I booked a large business dinner here (7 people).  I figured it would be pretty good but kinda touristy and celebrity cheffy.. . Day.Um.. . Dayum.. . I guess Keller is the greatest chef in the Western Hemisphere for a reason.. . This place is blow your doors off, make you weepy, please don't make me leave amazeballs.. . My dinner crew included 4 spaniards and a Frenchman.  Which are the two countries that are most proud of their own food and look down on American food.  All of them said it was one of the best meals they ever had.. . Seafood. Charcuterie.  Pigs ears (yes, DO IT, THEY ARENT WHAT YOU IMAGINE).  Steak frites.  Roast chicken.. . Absolutely killer.  Do this.
I was in the Venetian for business and decided to try Bouchon for lunch.   Maybe my expectations were too high but it if I had to describe it in one word it would be "disappointing".  My server Douglass was great.  Long time Las Vegan and fun and prompt.  I rarely send back food but the escargo was so bad I did it.  Bad escargot in a french place is a sin.. . I might give it another try but with so many other places to try n Vegas, it's unlikely to make the top of my list.
