so my husband had high expectations of this, he's never seen cirque b4, (i have but just 1 other show 'drallion'), so i had an idea of what to expect and i knew i'd be blown away, but i didn't think my husband would love it as much as he did lol, so that was a great surprise for me.. so we walked into the theater and found out we had front row center, AMAZING! (we bought our tix on vegas.com so we didn't know where our seats were til we got the tix and were directed to our seats). i was worried tho cuz i know w/ a few cirque shows, having front row means u don't get to see 'everything' like u would if u were further away lol and can see the whole picture.. but even tho that was partially the case a few times, i must say it was wonderfully memorable to see and hear the cast so up close. i could see the girls' hair styles being so intricately done, and u can't see that from the back of the theater! i could hear their whispers and see the details of their costumes up close! i got 'snowed' on and brought a souvenir 'flower petal' (tissue paper lol) home to forever remember this visually and emotionally captivating experience! we got to have the cast run right by our feet (the staff tells u b4 the show to keep the legroom to a minimum cuz the cast will be running thru at any given moment lol), they were coming from every angle and appearing suddenly outta nowhere constantly lol. u really have to keep looking around the whole scene lol. the whole walls of the theater were a bunch of mini balconies for them to be on and move around, swinging back and forth sometimes.. it was a lot of gravity defying action.. there was at least 1 free fall to the floor lol, but yeah a lot of them were wired to cables and whatnot. the 'stage' moves on all angles, even straight up vertical and just WOW... there was just 1 segment where i wasn't thrilled. one of the cast is on top of the stage while it's vertical and it's a digital image fight btwn various characters.. really, it would've been SO much better if this was real ppl instead of digital images lol.. but i guess they needed a break and to set up the next segments so it was a time killer.. but man, having the cast inches away from me was just mind blowing on so many levels.. our heads were darting every which way to try and catch everything, it was really hard to choose what to look at lol, so much was going on! btw, after the show ended (i was dreading the end lol), i took a peek at the 'under stage' where all the magic happens lol, it goes down DEEP! i wish i could've taken a pic of the under stage and the balconies lol... so 2 cirque shows down, a bunch more to go! cuz i'm def making it my life's mission to see every cirque show in existance b4 i die! :)))) the husband was so thrilled by the show he was *eager* to buy a souvenir from the gift shop lol, i thought was so cute.. days later and he's still hyped about the show lol :) so thank u KA for being the absolute highlight of our whole vegas trip (our official honeymoon/1st wedding anniv!)
Ka is one of the most innovative, creative, jaw-dropping, and mesmerizing Cirque de Soleil acts that Vegas has to offer! The reviews aren't lying, as this is voted as one of the top shows on various tourist Vegas websites.. . Unlike other Cirque de Soleil shows, Ka has a driven plot, in which it narrates the coming of age of a young man and woman through their encounters with love, death, and hardships. The show itself is absolutely amazing with the creative use of a moving stage and CGI effects, that will keep the audience at the edge of their seats.. . I thoroughly enjoyed Ka's creative uses of certain characters (that turtle, starfish, and crab!) as it will elicit laughter and warm responses from the audience. Not only that, but the music score is amazing and appropriate for each scene, bringing seamless transition between acts and highlighting the climaxes.. . This is a great show for families and friends. The audience will fall in love with the cast (don't forget about the long-haired Tarzan adorned in body glitter!), pyro projections, martial arts choreography, and gravity-defying performances. . . TIP - Ka is doing a spring promotion where tickets are 50% off, with prices starting as low as $50! Take advantage of this deal as it is supposed to end through June 2014.
We came here last night 5/10. Paid relatively huge amount for this so we were expecting a spectacular show. I came out disappointed. We were advised to seat after the 8th row since we were told there will be fire but there were only one scene with it and didn't even last long. . . Now that I am reading other reviews, it was really unfortunate about the fatal incident that they needed to change the last scene with projections. It was a very long part and it was the climax. Given that, they could've at least lessen the price. . . 2 stars for the amazing acrobats. I wasn't impressed with the storyline or the martial arts.
Dear KA, thank you for replacing the scene where the unfortunate performer lost her life with a 16-bit video game montage that lasted for nearly twenty minutes without lowering the price of your production by a cent.  Certainly not my 'style' of performance it was as a gift to my mother and aunt during their visit that we attended the show at The MGM and truly impressed by the athleticism throughout the show along with the costumes I cannot say the storyline did much for me at all.  Admittedly awe-struck by much of the show and the acrobatics suffice it to say that any semblance 'wow' factor was completely undermined by the lackluster penultimate scene and although I was unlikely to ever pay for a Cirque performance again even before that it is a veritable guarantee that I'll not do so again now.
This was a ok show but don't pay full price. I wish we had seen it before they changed the last part of the show. The change just made the show drag and didn't  really fit in with the rest of the live action. As for the live part it could have been  better. I think it's time they took a step back and re-worked the show. The sets are great they just need to freshen up the show to match the amazing sets. . It's  best if your not a night owl to see the early show because it's slow in places and you might fall asleep.
