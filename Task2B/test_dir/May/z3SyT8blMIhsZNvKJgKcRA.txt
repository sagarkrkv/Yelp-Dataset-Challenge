Had a less than enjoyable stay at Caesars Palace. Smokey room, dated everything, and poor customer service. Gambling odds were not great, but that is to be expected at any casino. Just so happens, won elsewhere, lost here. The shops are nothing to write home about. Rather stay at a Wynn property.
ok after I wrote my last review they offered us 2 free nights . it was like the one we had long ago so it was pretty good. but was getting pretty old.but we had to fly out there again round trip.we stayed the 2 days there and stayed the rest of the time at rio.
Number two isn't a bad place to be, and Caesar's is my 2nd favorite hotel on the Strip. . . I stayed here for a conference a few years ago and had a great room with a terrific shower.  The pool was awesome as well and staff were friendly.  There were a ton of dining options, lots of shopping and the place was clean and didn't stink like smoke like some of the other casinos.. . If I came back on personal vacation, I'd definitely stay here.
Worst casino ever. I book a comp 5 nights at Lauren collection tower , I even check in on email on date of arrival.  When I arrive they did a switch and bait and gave me the old tower which is dirtier than a motel 6.  I didn't fly from ny to get this type of service n quality. I ask them next 2 days if they can switch room , they can't help. So I cxl my rest nights and got myself comp room at MGM. Even the cheapest room at MGM looks 10x and update them Cesar.  At Cesar casino the valet is a mile work from the room or check in so having kids with stroller is terrible experience. I would never go to Cesar again. They will lose customer
Le Caesar Palace est autant imposant par sa taille que par sa prestance.. Ses services sont multiples: casinos, hotels, bars, restaurants, gogo danseuses. Tout est fait pour que vous n'ayez pas a quitter l'hotel, vous y trouverez tout a l'interieur. C'est clinquant de decadence, mais apres tout, c'est le strip, c'est Vegas! . . CONSEILS. - Si vous jouez au casino, donner $2-$5 de pourboire au serveur/serveuse pour un service de boisson + rapide et commandez des $1 margarita toute la soiree (excellent qualite/prix). - Le service de l'hotel est au top. A votre arrivee, au check in, demandez poliment un upgrade ou une chambre en hauteur (renovee) et ils essaieront toujours au mieux de vous accommoder
I WAS ROBBED WHILE IN THE ROOM!!!  Caesars Entertainment  They have still. not explained or cooperated to help with an investigation!!!  Here's the. latest letter I sent to them.... . CCMSI - Caesars Entertainment   Incident DL20140545435. Las Vegas NV      Metro Case LLV140318002623.       5-6-2014. . To whom it may concern,. . I am writing this in regards to a stay we had at the Quad Resort on. 3-18-2014.  Our locked room was entered that night while we slept.  Suitcase. and many other items were taken, all which can be replaced.. . The real issue here is that someone must have had a Master key to get past. the lock.  This is a scary fact the more you think about it.. . Security took a report, I filed a police report and they asked if there was. any video surveillance.  Well I called and have asked that 4 different times. with no answer to this day.  Do you really care about getting my stuff back?. . I was sent a letter from CCMSI, called as requested to Barbara Humphries, I. was told that an adjuster would call me within 48 hours.  A week later I. called back that they still hadn't called.  Barbara said that rarely happens. and that they would be in touch in a day or two.  I did get a call finally. and was asked the same questions as security had reported and was told they. would send a letter in a week.  . . Well it had been at least a month so I called 4-30 to Barbara again, she. forwarded the call and I left a message.  As of 5-5 still no call back, so I. left a message where we started with the Quad risk management and of course. RT Germain passed it on to Michelle Stackland which has not gotten back to. me.  What's new.... . You know the personal property that we lost is not the problem, it's the way. you have gone about handling a bad situation.  No explanations, no help,. nothing but avoiding and passing the problem on.. . I've been a Diamond card player at Harrah's for well over 10 years. consecutively and will certainly not attempt to play at any affiliated place. very much in the future.  I deserve to know how they got in the room, was. there video and what was done to try and mitigate the problem.. . You have definitely lost a long time customer and I have already told. friends and associates' what happen in Vegas and how it's been handled.. . Obviously you don't care!. . SWK
Huge hotel! It just goes on forever! Loved the shadow girl lounge. Had myself a Cosmo and watched a great show. Haha servers weren't too bad either ;p
Cesars is a nice hotel & they sure has grown over the years. The mall is a big attraction for shoppers. Can't say that its one of my favorite casino's to hang out & gamble in. There's not a lot of tables or slot machines compared to other hotels on the strip. . They have some really nice rooms, more in the newer towers but it's gotten so expensive to stay there. Room rates are ridiculous!! . It's a great location on the strip where there are other hotels & attractions within walking distance. . Not sure if the buffet has changed over the past several years but when I went with some friends in town I was so embarrassed!! Smallest buffet I've ever seen & couldn't believe it. Was soooo disappointed with it!
The whole start of this get-together with friends was a disaster, but was vastly improved by our experience at Caesars Palace! When my friend called me to tell me that he had missed his flight (mind you he had already had to cancel five days of this trip due to a very important job interview that came up at the last minute), he was freaked out because 1) the room was under his name, and 2) one of his friends that was coming up (whom I didn't know) was already in the air. Upon calling Caesar's, they said that I could simply add my name onto the room so we could check-in on time, provided that I give them a credit card of mine upon arrival. Perfect! So everything goes as planned until I get to the room ... As soon as I open the room door, a rather funky odor hit me hard ... upon entering, I find that the room they had assigned me had not been cleaned from the previous guests' stay, and the odor was really bad in there, the vent was hanging open, there were bottles everywhere and towels were strewn everywhere, so I called down to the front and calmly informed them on the situation. They placed me on a brief hold while they tried to make sense of everything because apparently according to the system I wasn't even assigned that room, or any room! The woman helping me told me to go back to the front desk and ask for a supervisor. I did so, and they were also confused when they looked in the system. They asked who helped me earlier, and of course the gentleman that initially helped me wasn't in the front, so Alex (shout-out to the young lady who was assisting me) apologized for the inconvenience, and proceeded to upgrade us to a room with two queens as well as upgrade us to the Palace Tower. This tower and room were MUCH nicer than the original (and spoiled us for the rest of the trip!). Everyone there was very pleasant, courteous, professional, and helpful! I will definitely be staying here again, as the location is good, the hotel is on the nicer end, and the staff just made everything that much better. I will admit that this will be a little more expensive than some of the other hotels along the strip, but honestly, when we switched to another hotel for the last few days of our trip, we wished we had been back at Caesar's, and we actually DID spend more time at Caesar's and the casinos near there than the places on the south side of the strip, which is where we relocated to (the Monte Carlo to be exact, which I will be posting about as well). Check-in time was a bit long, but upon reading reviews on all the casinos, I know that is inevitable. A little patience and courtesy goes a long way. I had to do A LOT of walking back and forth during this ordeal, but that was just good exercise. I wasn't impatient with anyone helping me, as I know customer service very well. Again, Alex at the front desk was VERY helpful. I've read reviews where guests gets angry and hateful at people and places, but that negativity is just unnecessary in this world, and sometimes people need to chill out, step-back, and just relax. All I know is the service here was top-notch and because of that, this hotel will be at the top of my list next time friends are in town.
Beautiful hotel. Superior service. Great restaurants. Just a bit crowded. But loved everything about it.
Worst experience in a hotel ever. First, they nickel and dime you about checking in early. Once we did checkin, we were greeted by an unclean room. We found an Advil on the floor and a dinner roll under the TV stand. Also, the bell hop had us carry our own luggage off of the luggage cart. Then we discovered that the sink was clogged. When we complained about the shitty room, nothing was resolved after 6 hrs. Then when we got back to our room, a couple was given our room. They freakin' had key cards that could open our room!. . Update: Guest services was not understanding at all. They kept trying to put us onhold or tell us that they'll call back. But we had already lost faith since the plumbing and dinner roll situation had not been resolved over an 8 hr period. They also invalidated our existing room keys while we were in the room before giving us a new room. We did not pay this much money to be homeless in Vegas.
Oh, the spendor! Oh, the shameless decadence! Oh, the near-nudity! I love this place and all its debauchery. I like to spend hours marveling at the decor, shopping, and high-stakes gambling. My less-than-ever-impressed buddy was disgusted with Caesars, which made me like it even more. I would live her, if I could. Its that fun.
So we came here for a very short visit to check the place out. We stopped at the bar and the bartender was awesome. I wanted something with blueberry so he got creative and concocted a drink with blueberry stoli, st germain, sprite, and probably a few other things. It was great! The hotel itself was gorgeous. I loved the architecture.
Caesar's was recommended by a member of our group. He stays there often when he goes to Vegas. After this stay he apologized profusely and never wants to go back.. . We arrived around 1pm and were given the option to pay $25 to check in immediately or wait until 3 for the room to be cleaned. We waited.. . We checked in at 3 to find our room hadn't been cleaned and the bell hop had us carry our bags from the service elevator. In the room, we found assorted trash (medicine and old key cards) and food left under the furniture. The front desk offered us a $50 drink comp and promised to clean the room. We gladly took it and headed to the pool.. . At the pool, we found toilet paper and other assorted trash in the water by the blackjack tables. Be extremely careful entering the pool a member of our party slipped on the stairs and about 30 minutes later another  hotel patron slipped no the same stairs. Luckily, neither was severely hurt.  . . After 1.5 hours we returned to the room to find the assorted trash removed (we had piled it next to the tv stand) but the old food remained. We again asked the front desk to help. First, they asked if it was our food (we'd spent less then 30 minutes in the room at this point) and then asked for the exact location so house keeping could remove it in the next 10 to 15 minutes. They also offered to comp all our drinks at the pool. Over the next 1.5 hours while we prepped for dinner, house keeping never arrived.. . While prepping for dinner we found that using one sink would cause the other sink to fill with dirty water. Again they assured us that maintenance would be right up (10 to 15 minutes) to correct the problem. Maintenance hadn't showed when we left for dinner an hour later. . . When we returned they told us we were changing rooms. The old food was still in the room and the sinks were still clogging. Again, we were told the bell hop would be right up. The bell hop never came. While we were waiting, another group had been given keys to our room and our keys were deactivated. . . 1.5 hours after we were told the bell hop would be "right up" the room change actually occurred. The room change occurred at 1230 am after a visit to the front desk when we needed to be up at 7 am for flights. . . . For the trouble, we were promised that all our drinks would be comped, a $50 food voucher (for breakfast), an upgraded room, and $50 off our original rate.. . Supervisor Jonathan Grant was extremely helpful in finally remedying the situation. If the story ended here, this would likely be a 3 star review. However, our problems continued the following morning.. . When we tried to use the $50 voucher for breakfast we were told we couldn't charge anything to the room as Caesar's had listed the room as cash only, even though there is a $200 hold on my card. We ended up paying for breakfast ourselves and headed back to the front desk to fix the situation. . . At the front desk we were promptly told by Supervisor MacKinzie Sherlock that Caesar's would not be honoring the comps we had been promised and would only remove the drink charges and $35 of our breakfast. Having spent roughly 1/3 of our stay speaking with the front desk and needing to leave for the airport we simply checked out.. . All in all my Caesar's experience was way below my expectations. If you're looking to stay on the strip near Caesar's, just stay at the Bellagio where I've stayed multiple times with no issues. Chances are I'll never go back to Caesar's and have already changed hotels for a large bachelor party in September.
