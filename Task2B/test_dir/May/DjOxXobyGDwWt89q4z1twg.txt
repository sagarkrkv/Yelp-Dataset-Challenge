So great! The ramen is great and everybody should get the fried rice! So great!
3 1/2 stars. Came in for lunch during the week. I sat at the counter due to the full house and went with the Tonkotsu shoyu ramen with egg and extra chashu.. . Sitting at the counter I was able to watch them prepare the ramen and noticed there was a chef in training. When I received my bowl all looked decent and tasted good with the exception that the ramen was overcooked and soggy. The patron next to me received his bowl and he ordered double meat and they only give him a single serving also which wasn't cool either. . . Service was decent, but lets get it together in the kitchen!
Well a co worker and I decided to go here for lunch. ( she frequents this spot).. The wait at lunch time was not horrible and the service was speedy. We got in and seated and ordered food within 5 minutes.. After ordering the food was up about minutes later ( everything is already ready to go in the back it's just noodles and pork essentially). The food was pretty tasty and and at a good temperature.The texture was great and he serving was large for the price.. The reason for the low rating. I am have never had such an upset stomach after eating any other food. I will try again, maybe a lighter dish and see if there is another reaction. However this did make me awfully ill.
I had the pork & chicken broth & my husband had the miso broth . The noodles were the perfect thickness the char siu was soft, the egg was more of a hard boiled instead of soft boiled. I like when the yolk is runny in the soup. . The pork belly bowl is a must have full of flavor! Must get the large size!
We were there at 5PM and restaurant was getting full.  For good reason, as there nothing bad to say about this place.  . . Ramen is extremely reasonably priced around $7 or $8, portions are not enormous but filling.  Low use of msg, as I'm not thirsty at all after the meal.  Noodles are cooked perfectly.. . The star is the black sesame ramen, very rich flavor, one of the best ones I've tasted.. . This small restaurant can be easily missed on Spring Mountain Road.  Best thing to do is use the GPS for first timers.. . Highly recommended!
Honestly, I don't think this place is as good as I expected. Ive tried some other ramen place tastes much better,I don't know why it's always packed, service is ok.
Been in the neighboring stores and always saw a line running out of monta ramen. There are lots of ways you can do ramen, they have a limited selection.  The ramen choices they do have all delicious. But I'd have to say their fried race stood out the most to me
Extremely friendly service like a sushi restaurant. But you have to really like Ramen because that's about all they have. And it just didn't seem like the food was easy to get excited about.
Legit ramen spot in Vegas!! . . The tonkatsu broth is so clean and flavorful and the noodle are just perfect! Sometimes they have a spicy tonkatsu special and that's my favorite since it adds a little kick! The only thing is the egg could be better. . . Very small place inside so go early.
best ramen in LV
So delicious, and I've had my share of tonkatsu ramen.  Perfect balance between the stock and that back fat :D. Served with thin noodles and cha shu.  The cha shu melts in your mouth however I think it competes with the fattiness of the soup. Personally I prefer a more meatier cha shu but this is pretty damn good.. . The gyozas were delicious I definitely recommend them.. . I would probably skip the pork belly bowl though. While it is still good, I've seriously had better. .  . Oh and if you're really hungry $2 will get u an extra portion of ramen. Good deal.. . An all around solid choice!
Best Ramen in Vegas,  no kidding. The soup base is authentic.  A friendly atmosphere place to eat
We've been back since our unfortunate incident and I'm happy to say that it's back to being our favorite ramen spot (:
The food was toooooo salty!!!!!! It is not bad but I couldnt finish it just simply because it is too salty!!!!!!!
This year, we've seen influx of new Ramen establishments in Las Vegas. Yet, Monta holds on to the throne. Sure, the long wait can be daunting, but it's for a reason.
First tried Monta at one of the Japanese Ramen festivals out in Torrance, CA. There were maybe several competitors but not one jazzed me. Except enter Monta. Small booth tucked in a corner. No heavy signage just three folks sweatin in the polstering heat serving up what unbeknowst to me the best ramen showcasing. Found out that they have a location out in Las Vegas and decided to take some family members out there to give it a try.. . Got there 30 minutes before they opened. All of us hungover from the night before, only to see that there is a line about to form! We turned off our engines parked and snagged in front of the line. in 30 minutes I kid you not, at least 40 others joined. Luckily we were in front. . . Starving and dehydrated. We ordered. I settled for the Spicy Tonkotsu with the added green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage. Added additionally the Nori + Nitamago. (dry seaweed and hard boiled egg, respectively) some corn, etc. My gal got the Tonkotsu BLACK. and whoa. I've never had a ramen to that degree ever in my 30 years of life. What is this? A smoky flavored broth? almost like a bbq tang? THIS was my highlight. It was unusual. It was weird. But in the most gnarliest of ways a ramen can be. I highly recommend that one. . . fyi: their Chasu Bowl is one of the better ones I have experienced in all of CA. Definitely worth it as a side dish. . . As a matter of fact. I am visiting MONTA again for MDW (Memorial Day Weekend) I am coming back. It wouldn't be a successful Vegas trip without a visit to Monta. Seriously best Ramen in town.
This place hands down is a much if your in Vegas. A little pass Chinatown you find yourself in a tiny hole in the wall but the wait is all worth it. Daily fresh noodles and broth to sip up.
Compared to Sora Ramen, I like this much better.  We had the thin noodles and they were al dente. The broth was also thicker and tastier. Try the takana fried rice (with mustard greens). It was also very tasty!
First Las Vegas Ramen I tried and I liked it.. . Had their spicy tonkotsu ramen bowl and it was quite good. Also tried their fried rice and gyoza, both were not bad. No complaints. I actually the price was cheaper than bay area places.. . Will go back to this place when craving ramen in Las Vegas. Maybe try their Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen next time.
Great overall!!!!
Keep in mind, a 4.5 would probably be spot on. I went here on my last trip to Vegas in Fall of 2013 and hadn't had time to review it.  I just came back from a Vegas trip where I made 2 trips here it was that good.  Keep in mind, this little food shopping plaza is a gem in general if you have a car to drive off the strip.. . My first time on this recent trip, I went with one of their specials, Kuro Black Garlic Oil Ramen.  There was this amazing, but not overly powerful garlic flavor. I somewhat wish it was more noticeable to be honest.  But everything else in terms of the noodles, chasu and broth was spot on.  I  have a soft spot for corn and an egg... and extra noodle of course =D. . My second visit on this recent trip was... right before my flight actually.  I went with my sure bet, the delicious Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen.  Again, the broth was very tasty and flavorful.  The spice is OK, but not as spicy as I probably would have liked/tolerated.  . . Until I can find better, my go to ramen/hangover spot.
Comfort food in a bowl of heaven!  We lucked out and got a seat at the counter within 5 minutes.  Which was fine with me! I love to watch chefs in action. I got the Tonkotsu Ramen with Chashu Pork and Nitamago.  The broth was smoky and out of this world!  The portions were huge!  Our server was a sweetheart!  Another great place for my late night cravings!
The ramen is okay (not as good as I thought it would be). The fried rice is better than the noodles.
