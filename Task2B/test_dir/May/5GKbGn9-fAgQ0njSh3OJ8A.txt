Terrible experience.    They lost our reservation for an Anniversary dinner .... we ends up seated between multiple other couples...music too loud to hear each other talk...he salami plate was one of the weakest presentations we have had....Caesar was over dressed and salty and the main course of veal parm was overcooked and salty.  The only highlight was our server and the wine.   So many better options for Italian in Vegas!
My wife and I were in Vegas for our 10 year anniversary and looking for somewhere with a nice atmosphere and view for dinner.  I read some reviews and decided to make a reservation at Lavo.  We were not disappointed. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the view of the strip and beautiful evening weather. The appetizers were excellent and main courses too.  The best part was the fried Oreos that our waitress recommended.  They may be the best thing I have ever tasted.  Be sure to save room for desert.  There was music playing, but it was not nearly as loud or distracting as some of the reviews made it sound.  Everything about our experience was top notch.  Will definitely be back on our next trip
Amazing! Have to try the Sunday Brunch. Great food and atomsphere!!
Get the meatball! Seriously, it is so awesome! We had some chicken Marsala as well, but I could have easily eaten meatballs all night.  The drinks were really good as well, and we sat outside so we could people watch on the strip. We will be here again soon!
3.5/5 for me. . Make sure to make reservations, as it was packed!   The food was good and service was very attentive.. . I recommend the flatbreads - Magherita and Porchetta. . Pastas were all good and everyone in my party was happy that they were cooked al dente but maybe just a bit too much sauce on the rigatoni alla melanzane and ricotta cavatelli.. . Buon appetito
This review is for the brunch at Lavo on a Sunday. We were a large group of 10 ladies. While service was OK and understandably so due to the large number of similar all-woman tables, the biggest problem wasn't the service, it was the food. None of the dishes we ordered were any good. No one at the table was pleased. My chicken in my caesar salad was dry and tasteless, the eggs benedict was undercooked, the steak was dry, and the rest was mediocre. The decor is great and the club is worth it. The brunch, not so much!
little disappointed with the waiters recommendation of the sea bass.. quite citrusy and unimaginative overall  with just those sliced cherry tomatoes, red and yellow.. the fish was not fresh.. I have to say the the large meatball appetizer was really nice..
Absolutely delicious and great service.. . The garlic bread was delicious and probably the best I've had at any restaurant.  The linguine with mixed seafood was also amazing- with the spicy sauce, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and clams!  The truffle fries are also delicious as well. . . Must try.
Nice and swanky!. The food is good also. It's pretty much a bar scene, but hey, it's Vegas!. It's loud so probably not the best place for a romantic meal or a business meeting. . You go here to have fun, eat good food and drink until you black-out. Ok maybe that's a bit extreme, but the place could do it to you.. Oh and the selection of food and drinks are enormous. You will find something here to satisfy you.. Don't forget to try one of the delicious desserts. Yum!
