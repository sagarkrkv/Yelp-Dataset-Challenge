We've stayed at the Encore several times. Just going to list everything to be quick. . Le Reve- awesome. There are better shows though. ie Absinthe is amazing. . The Buffet- not as many options as I expected. Basically salad, pasta, seafood or imitation Asian. . Casino- we spend a lot of time here. Staff is nice. Drinks come around sort of often. . The Room- everything looks clean and smells nice. Never had a problem with theft or service. Bed is uncomfortable. Seating area is always freezing compared to sleeping area. I don't understand why the towels are like sand paper.... Fridge space for $25 is stupid. Hello... Where's the coffee!?. Oh. The lowest floor we've stayed on was the 27th. We've never had a noise problem. Not from neighbors or the clubs. . Xcess- very nice. Felt out of place in my flats. Really out of place. Ha!. Society- yum. I eat here often.. Botero- wow!. Spa- smelled good. Awesome massage. Salon- Waxed my eyebrows for the first time. The lady was very nice and knowledgeable. . . Overall, we love staying here. But will probably try something new next time. Just because it's time. I think we've stayed here at the very least 5 times.
Great hotel, but be cautious of the hidden fees. They will charge your credit card without your approval and dislike children staying there.
Stayed here in Feb 2014 at the King Tower Suites. Note..... You have your own driveway with security there, own elevators away from regular hotel lobby, no resort fees, free hot beverage before 8 am in tegu cafe, and in room breakfast every morning.  Service was fantastic at the front valet, check in lady was a bit snooty, casino staff was good, servers for the casino floor didn't remember what you order although we tipped. Experience was good except the few negatives.  Wi Fi is free in the Tower Suite rooms as well and no extra resort fees
This was my first time staying at Encore and I was not disappointed. We have been to Vegas a dozen times and have stayed at many of the hotels but Encore has to be my favorite so far. . The rooms were comfortable and very spacious. The bed was amazing. It was like laying on a bed of clouds! The bathroom had enough room for multiple people to get ready with enough mirror space for everyone. The Desert Bambu bath products are some of the best! I am tempted to call the Wynn and see if I can buy full size bottles of the stuff! It was also nice having the sitting area. . We didn't leave the property very often but that was not a bad thing! The pool was fabulous. Servers came around pretty frequently. The staff also came around quickly to clean or the lounge chairs when people left. The area was clean and it seemed like someone was always around to help if you needed it.. We were on the 37th floor and there was little outside noise that could be heard. We couldn't even hear the rooms next to us if they had their TV on. What a nice change!. The only hiccup was that we were there for a wedding and it was requested that all the guests be inthe same area. This delayed getting our room a little bit because it was not cleaned when we checked into the hotel. This is no fault of the hotel. I actually thoguht it was great that they grouped us together...and even upgraded a few of us. . Overall we had a wonderful experience. The service was top notch. For example, do you know any other hotel that will check into your flight for you and print the boarding pass at no charge? They do that at the Encore! Yes, it does cost a little more money overall, but it is money well spent! We did end up visiting a few other hotels/casinos during our stay and that just solidified that we would be back to the Encore. It is just a different standard of service.. This was also the first time that I didn't want to leave the hotel for any reason. Everything I wanted was on the property. Job well done, Encore!
My favorite hotel in Vegas.Encore and wynn.All the restaurant are amazing,is classy ,the spa is AMAZING!The bed are so confortable.
My wife and I enjoyed the Encore for it's luxurious rooms. We had a great time with all the amazing amenities. I kind of like details and the electric curtains were so cool and made it so easy to be able to control them from across the room. The only thing I didn't like was that the internet wasn't free. Usually there is a free option and upgrades you can pay for but not here. Great location for a hotel and it's at a great spot on the strip.
I've been to Vegas at least 100x in my life. To be honest, I prefer staying on this side of the strip, as it's close to the mall and many of the clubs/restaurants that I really enjoy going to. Wynn/Encore is located right across the street from the Fashion Show Mall and next to the Venetian/Palazzo. Encore is the newer tower of Wynn.. . My absolute favorite hotel on the street is the Palazzo. The parking garage at Wynn and Encore is small and confusing. The service, in my experience, hasn't been as pleasant even though they go out of their way to attempt to say your last name at every place you go to in here and print your name on your room key card. Decor wise, I would say it's most like the Bellagio. All rooms are suites, and if you are facing the strip, you may be able to hear noise from the clubs downstairs even if you're on the 23rd floor.. . Despite all this, this is a truly beautiful, clean, and wonderful hotel. If you're looking for luxury on the strip, this is definitely one of the best hotels to stay. . . Also: points down for no reception and spotty wifi. $25 resort fee will include wifi.
DO NOT waste money.  I am 40s and have been a couple hundred places.  I had bad food, bad service, bad room and hall way flood.  When asked what was being done felt like I was a discount ally motel.  This is not the place to go if you think Steve Wynn will give you his time.  I have tried it twice and had friends go through the same thing.  NOT SURE STEVE CARES.. . NO NO NO run
For the ladies, beware if you are staying here for EDC week.... . I wish I could stay at the Encore each time I came to Vegas. If you want to be treated like a King/Queen, they definitely do their best to make you feel like royalty. . . Aside from minor personal complaints, I must say this is a classy place. As I arrived for my 9 day stay during EDC week last June, the bell boy was making a few remarks that I wasn't too thrilled about. He mentioned, "I can tell you guys won't be eating at any of our restaurants". After explaining that we were staying 9 days and the fact that we did NOT bring any food with us, he said okay. Yes I had a big cooler to hold all my alcohol and to my surprise, they almost did not allow me to have so much due to the fact that they didn't want us to be all crazy in the hotel. Come on! I didn't pay so much for my bf and I to be hassled left and right. 9 days is a lot, it wasn't like I wasn't going to purchase anything there. . . Check in can be hit or miss with the lines. Just be patient, the place is worth it! The casino is quite lively at any time of day and everyone is extremely helpful when you need anything.. . Our suite was lovely! Very comfortable, very clean, and was better than the pictures online! We had a crazy schedule where we were asleep during the day and up at night. I really wish the maid services paid a little more attention to the DO NOT DISTURB signs. Every now and then we had to yell through the door to go away. They do, however, send someone to clean your room at whatever time you ask so we were grateful for that at least.. . I am aware of the class this place has, but I had issues each time I entered/tried leaving to EDC. Security stopped me each day and told me to go back to my room to cover up or wait outside until I cover up. WHAT? I'm just trying to leave/return to my room, not hang out and parade myself for the hotel guests! I thought this was incredibly rude especially since my outfits were not something out of the norm. I saw girls on the floor but I am the one being scolded? Please..... . The food here is glorious! Beware, there is nothing cheap here or at the Wynn! Dinner for two at some places were $300+ no alcohol! To this day, we still think all our expensive meals were worth it. Room service is devine! I was sick one day and ordered soup to the room. Best soup ever! I can't forget how amazing it was.. . Due to my personal complaints, I'm not sure I want to stay at an EDM friendly place and get picked on when I just want to leave/enter my damn hotel. Also, if you are looking for great rates, buying a flight+hotel is the cheapest way to go. . . I wanted to give the Encore another 9 days of business this year, but for EDC, I think I'll go to friendlier EDM hotel. I'll make sure to come back here during a regular week instead no thanks to those security guys.
