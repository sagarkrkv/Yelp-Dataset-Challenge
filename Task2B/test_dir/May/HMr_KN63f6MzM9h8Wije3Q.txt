This was my first holiday to Vegas travelling from the UK. For the price paid the room was large with 2 big comfortable beds and a 40" TV, I thought it was excellent value and it's in a great location.  I had no problems with the hotel WiFi on my iPhone 5, I was required to log in each day though.. . Plenty to do inside the hotel with the casino, shops, bars, gym, pool, restaurants, food outlets, amusements etc. overall I was very impressed.
Such a fan of this hotel. We saw Zumanity during our last stay and loved it - scored tickets at a great price and enjoyed the show immensely. . . Actually staying there this time was even better. We stayed in the Player's suite, and it was huge. The four of us had plenty of room to get ready to go out, relax, and have a little privacy if work called or we needed a nap. . . The room was clean, and it's about a 15 minute walk to the Bellagio. We definitely appreciated the location. The pool was also excellent. We weren't looking for a wild party, just a chill place to relax in the sun. The music was a nice variety of classic rock, techno, and pop, so there was a little something for everyone.. . There was a slight hiccup with processing credit cards, but as soon as we pointed it out, the manager was all over it. . . Would definitely stay again.
As you walk through the different casinos in Vegas you get a "feel." Some are snobby, some are skanky, some are high class.  NYNY definitely has a laid back feel.  There were a mix of folk, from seniors, to 20 somethings partying it up.  The play great music.  Only complaint is the smell.  PU!  It's like a combination of smoke and fabreeze. Not pleasant.  Staff is very polite and eager to help.  Rooms are clean.  Pool was nice, good vibe, not a party pool.  Loud music, lots of folks having fun. Fun casino.  Nice hotel room for the price.
I have never had the experience of staying at NYNY yet, but vow to. . . It's my favorite looking hotel from the outside and in out of all the hotels on the strip. Bar none.. . On this visit we didn't spend an incredible amount of time in the hotel. I did lose 10 bucks to a Judge Judy machine (a small kick for this fan of her no nonsense TV show).. and I did check out the Coney Island Arcade that was a source of much enjoyment and fun for myself and my cousins years ago when our families stayed at the Monte Carlo. . . It's a gorgeous and fun themed hotel that is always clean, and tidy with a great feel of class and excitement sprinkled in. Count me as a fan.
I came to Las Vegas with my wife and her nephew to celebrate another of her Nephew's birthday.. . We stayed at New York, New York Hotel and Casino on this Vegas Trip. On the night that we had arrived, the winds were extremely strong.  I took about 5 minutes for someone to come to our Vehicle from bell services while we were standing in what seemed like hurricane strength winds.. . Arriving inside, we had no trouble with our room, considering it was 15 minutes until Midnight (we were on the verge of loosing our reservation due to heavy traffic on the I-15 from L.A.).  Once in our room, we wanted something cold to drink and we noticed there was no Mini Fridge in the room.  Bell Services arrived about 10 minutes after we were in our room with our bags from the car earlier...service here was faster than what it was at the Valet.  . . On our 2nd day were were out most of the day with our Vegas out of town Family, so we didn't spend much time at the hotel enough to continue this review. . Day 3, I left to run  a few errands and my wife had decided to order room service, but we had no Menu in our room, so after I had come back a few hours later we decided to go eat at the America restaurant down stairs, instead.. . Over all, our stay here was great and I would not mind spending another Vegas trip here...considering I never got to ride the Roller Coaster.
Stay here with my wife for 2 nights over a birthday weekend.  The views were great but the room was so hot even after calling for maintenance.  Not sure for the price I would recommend it to anyone.  Casinois small but nice.  Location on strip is good.
Love the Roller Coaster. One of the big reasons to visit New York New York is that awesome coaster. I have not played on the tables, so my rating excludes the casino floor for the most part. It was a bit dark, as the lighting remind me more of what I may come to expect walking down the streets of new York at night. Its a neat touch, but may annoy me if I were trying to roll the dice. Definitely worth a visit if you happen to be in vegas, and don't forget the awesome rollercoaster.
This hotel has always been a great experience.  Ive stayed here many times. The rooms are nice, everything is clean and the pool is at the perfect temperature.  Its a keeper! There was a night front desk agent named Jennifer that was really rude though.
They charged a $20 convenience fee per day and provided mascara stained sheets, no in room coffee maker, an undersized pool (not enough seats for everyone), and weak restaurant options.  I'd recommend staying elsewhere on the strip for the price.
I thought the hotel was quite charming, aside from a few flaws.  . . Wifi is decent, with capable speeds able to play video.. . The gym (in a separate part of the complex in another TOWER) should have been placed a tad closer to the other rooms.  The gym itself is quite small at any rate; though, there weren't a lot of people using it (probably for fear of people having to sweat profusely and then take the long and embarrassing trek back to the room).  . . The atmosphere and the amenities in the main floor are pretty fun.  Huge selection of a variety of restaurants to spend boatloads of cash on.. . The roller coaster is decidedly awful.  I must have banged my head five times on that hard seat--they should really consider remodeling that thing for a smoother experience.  They certainly make enough cash from it.
Otimos custo-beneficio e localizacao. Bom pra familias, casais, turistas em geral. Talvez n seja a melhor pedida para os solteiros que estejam atras do glamour das baladas. O clima aqui e de Vegas sim, so que mais confortavel. Me senti a vontade e recomendo! ;). . It's affordable and well located. Ideal for families, couples, tourists in general. Maybe it's not the best option for singles who are looking for fency & glamour of Vega's nightlife. Anyway, I felt free there and recomend it. ;)
This casino is fun to wander around it. It isn't the nicest place in Vegas, but it isn't the worst either. Anyone who is a fan of the real New York will get a kick out of the details that are truly reminiscent of the Big Apple. I liked watching the rooftop roller coaster. This is also the spot to see "Zumanity" which is really fun (for adults). I won't likely stay here, but I will likely stop into the casino or go on the roller coaster again.
New York New York is a fun casino. As far as variety goes, it offers a lot of things besides the usual drinking and gambling. You've probably noticed the roller coaster, which is pretty good for what it is. The ride is slightly rickety, but it's an option, so why the hell not? There's even an arcade if you brought the children along to party. The restaurant/bar area is unique, decorated to resemble no other than the streets of New York City! Okay, maybe the city in its infancy (because I certainly never saw it look that way in my lifetime), but you didn't really come here to see the Statue of Liberty, did you? New York New York is also the home of Zumanity, absolutely the best Cirque Du Soleil show in town. Not for the timid and uptight. I've only stayed in the suites here, kind of an odd setup with the jacuzzi at the side of the bed, but I suppose if you are going for romantic that might be ideal. I don't know, I don't find there to anything romantic about drunkenly stumbling out of the bathtub and passing out in my bed wet and naked after a long night in Vegas. Some of the rooms received a face lift during the last couple years, but others may still be aged like the casino itself. Overall, a fun experience.
Just stayed in a spa room at New York New York for 3 days. The giant jacuzzi tub in the room was awesome. The price of the room was incredible as well. The only downside? The wifi was terrible. TERRIBLE. To have it included in the daily "resort fee" was just insulting.
