This buffet is pricey ($38 for dinner) but it is so worth it! There are so many different stations and types of food:. -Carving (ham, turkey, free range chicken, roast beef). -Seafood (crab legs, assorted fish). -Salad. -Meats and Cheeses. -Soups. -Desserts (Cookies, cakes, sugar free, gluten free, frozen custard). -Asian (Flank steak, stir fry, rice). -Italian (Pastas). -American (roasted potatoes, vegetables). . The line into the restaurant was pretty long. We waited about 15 minutes to pay and be seated. The wait staff was foreign and didn't really converse or understand too much but they were attentive. . . If you are visiting from another hotel or staying in The Bellagio this is a great eatery if you don't mind spending the dough.
I went to this Buffet a few years back and I really enjoyed it. It was pricey for a buffet though. We didn't drink because the mimosas were expensive and we were hung over anyway. So on to the food. I loved the pasta selection. It was really good and the sauces were delicious! I'm picky about Chinese food so that's not something I would eat at a buffet. The crab legs were delicious. The selection of food and desserts were good overall.
I have eaten at the Bellagio buffet about 7 times over the past 5 years and have usually enjoyed the food and service. I normally would have given the buffet 4-stars (easily), but my last two visits (one today and once this past April) have changed my mind and rating. The service has slowly degraded to the point that the staff seems rushed/impatient, while the tables aren't very clean. As far as food goes the variety is still there, but it tends to be drier, flavorless, and lifeless. When I return again in a few weeks I'll be looking for another place to eat.
Eines der teureren Buffets in Las Vegas, aber wir wollten uns mal das Bellagio mit seiner wunderbaren Blumenwelt anschauen und sind dann auch zum Buffet. Die Auswahl und die Qualitat der angebotenen Speisen ist wirklich hervorragend. Ich habe mir ofter von dem wahnsinnig zarten Kobe-Rind geholt. Das war leider so gut, dass ich mich entgegen meiner sonstigen Gepflogenheiten nicht durch alles durchprobieren konnte, da meine Aufnahmefahigkeit bereits vorher zu Ende war.
I'm not really a buffet person, but everyone says you have to go to a buffet in Vegas. I'm a foodie; buffets completely turn me off. Despite my reservations, this was my third trip to the strip and I decided to give it a shot. . . We were lucky enough to visit the buffet during Mothers Day weekend, so we had the holiday dinner option for about $50/person.  The dinner had some additional items that could have been special for the holiday, such as beef Wellington, snow and king crab legs, prime rib, etc. so keep that in mind as you read my review. . . The waitstaff were extremely hospitable. You don't have to get your own drinks here, they bring them for you. My refills were done before the liquid hit the bottom of the cup. I asked for coffee with my dessert and he brought me an entire pot. Unlimited alcoholic drink options were available for an additional $5 but honestly I wanted to save my calories for the expansive dessert table. . . The only item I was not impressed with was the paella. There was bits of sand in the mussels.However, the rest of my meal was epic. I won't gross you out with the details of my pig-out session, but the seafood was especially good and nothing ran out or emptied. The dessert table was phenomenal. The creme brulee was just as good as a quality establishment.  . . I had similar dishes at the buffet at The Mirage and was unimpressed. See my review of that one, if you like. If I could choose any buffet on the strip, it would be Bellagio.
Everywhere in Vegas is expensive. So....I think this is actually one of the better deals out there. It's $35 per person (roughly) for dinner. If you drink alcohol it will clearly add more to your bill, so stick to water and get the free booze while you are gambling. Is everything at the buffet amazing? No, but there are literally a million options. The best things- pesto tortellini, squash bisque, crab legs, tiki masala, and roast chicken. The line can be long but it moves quick, but it is worth the wait.
We love this place, been there 2 times in the last 4 months!. . Great food, pasta, salad, delicious meet (beef, turkey, chicken, lamb), great sides, sushi bar, shrimp and crabs... Huge dessert selection!
Sunday of Memorial Day wkd, 730pm. Plan B after Bacchanal at Caesar's gave us a 2-hr wait.. . The Buffet at Bellagio has soooo fallen off it's allure and pedestal of being one of the top, high-end buffets in Vegas of years ago. The first sign was that we (party of 2) only had to wait 15 minutes.. . Their carving station meats were not plentiful and selective. Meats did not taste all that good. Ribs were dry. Steaks were dry. Turkey tasted like cardboard.. . Turkey gravy was super salty. . . One of the carvers took his sweet @ss time slicing every single piece of prime rib and turkey. Makes for an even longer wait! arghhh!. . The layout is horrible. . . Not much main dish selection. . . Food was very tasteless.. . Everything seemed so "bulk cafeteria" made.. . They close at 1030, but at 9pm, the dessert station was "all out of chocolate covered strawberries". So lame.. . Desserts did not taste good. The cheesecake was so bad. Didn't even have any chocolate cake selections!. . A sign of a buffet that is not high-end? When the ice cream station is NOT manned by a human being. More of a sign that a buffet is actually low-end? When the ice cream station is a crappy soft-serve, manual, help-yourself dispenser! This is a severe contrast to the manned, well-decorated, well-presented gelato stations at the Rio Carnival, the Aria Buffet, the Bacchanal, etc.. . To top things off, it was a "holiday weekend", so they charged "holiday prices". $47.99+tax pp. Yet, the selection, the quality, and the experience was barely better than that of cross of Hometown Buffet and Souplantation!. . Sorry Bellagio Buffet. Never again until you renovate, reinvent, and rejuvenate!
Average food. I used to like it more when it was less expensive. Good options of sushi and brunch food. It's a good buffet overall .
My friend and I came here during Memorial Day Weekend. We came during the transition between brunch to dinner time (but we paid dinner prices) so it was really nice to be able to eat a bit of everything. . . I remember thinking it was a very decent price for a Vegas Buffet... but then I was not too impressed when it came down to the food. . . I just gathered a bit of everything to take *a bite* and the only thing that I really enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese, shrimp cocktail & crab legs!! After the experimental plates, I just filled up on the expensive stuff to get my money's worth!! . . I also wanted to try the prime rib, but my friend said her slice was over cooked even though she asked for a medium/medium-rare cut. I saw all of the meats and it DID look too over cooked so I passed on the prime rib. What a disappointment... . . I was especially unsatisfied with their dessert selection... I gathered all the pretty desserts that would fit on a plate: macaroons, eclairs, tarts and a chocolate covered strawberry... but it was all so mediocre... Most items only got one bite from me. I took a double taste on the flan, but I was still not impressed. The only dessert I finished was this Cappuccino shooter (minus the whipped cream on top).
I really liked the quality of food. And it is weird that I liked the coke they provide.. . There were so many choices of food and I wished I had bigger stomach so I can eat more.. . The desserts were absolutely delicious and not too sweet.
This was the best out of the 4 buffets we tried out (the others were Le Village, Cravings and Spice Market). They have both king and snow crab legs, which were awesome. Their ribs and prime rib are delicious. They have a whole variety of other food for those that aren't into their big ticket items too. They do not clear the dining room between lunch and dinner so you can catch their dinner items with lunch prices by going for a late lunch if you're so inclined. There's usually at least a short line to get in but it's not too bad as long as you don't go during peak hours.

The sushi selection is great here!!  Their poke is delicious as are the special rolls.  This part of the buffet and the plentiful crab equals 4.5 stars.  Another good dish was the lobster mac n cheese.. . The rest of the buffet is just mediocre.  The pastas taste bland.  Everything is overcooked, sitting under heat lamps.  The turn over on the food was very slow.  The desserts looked delicious, but failed to taste that way.  The restaurant is a bit outdated and we felt like we were eating in a cafeteria.
