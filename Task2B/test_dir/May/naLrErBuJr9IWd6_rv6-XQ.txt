Just went last night and its the best steak house I have been. Service was great, always very attentive and there to clean up after you, giving you many assortments of breads, and 5 different assortments of sauces for the steak. We got the porterhouse , brussel sprouts and the polenta. All of it was excellent!!! We didn't order dessert but still got these small bites of a lemon and a chocolate pie which were good. Love this place.
Service, food, ambiance...all five stars. I have eaten at all of the best steakhouses across the country and Cut is still a cut above. . . Started with their version of a chop salad shared a porterhouse, had mushrooms and peas and finished it off with a banana creme brulee inspired dessert that was all the happy ending anyone could want. . . Yum!
Every year our company goes to Vegas and we have one special fancy-schmancy dinner. I chose Cut  in 2013 because I am a carnivore and wanted a really good steakhouse. It was amazing. They bring the cuts of meat to your table and explain about the marbling of each cut and type of beef. Our waiter, I wish I could remember his name, was the most wonderful waiter who was very knowledgeable and able to give us great recommendations. When our foodarrived there was a cadre of servers, it was like an army descended  upon our table. We had one little mishap where one of the servers knocked over a wine glass and splashed some wine on one of my colleagues and his appetizer. They immediately brought him a fresh appetizer and the manager came over, gave him club soda and fresh napkins for dabbing at the spots and offered to buy him a brand new shirt and gave him his card. I think it was some of the best customer service I've ever seen. And of course, the food was phenomenal. Most of our party got Wagyu of some kind and one got lobster. They all thanked me for picking Cut and we rolled ourselves back to our hotel to begin our food comas.
Most of what I ate was very good, but at these prices I expect it to be excellent. Some of our groups' sides were served warm instead of hot. My steak had parts that were medium rare and parts that were medium. A filet should be consistent throughout. . . The presentation was so-so. Ambiance was ok, but not what I consider a classic steakhouse feel. The music was a bit all over the place - a although I like The Chemical Brothers, I don't expect to hear them in a restaurant like this. . . There are better options for an expensive steak dinner on the strip.
I've gone to a lot of the higher end steak houses in Vegas and this one is my least favorite. Service was 5 stars, the sides and the dessert we ordered were really good, however, I had to knock my rating down two stars because the star of the dinner, my wagyu filet, wasn't as good as I expected.  I was a little turned off when oursever brought out waxed examples of the different kinds of beef and explained the differences between kobe, wagyu, the marbling, etc.  To me this felt like they were trying to upsell me, I've never seen this before at a steak house, only when a place brings out their waxed trays displaying their desserts.  I would've been more okay with this if he asked us if we'd like the dog and pony show, because I already knew all the differences and already knew I was going to order the wagyu.  When my steak arrived, it was completely crusted with a blend of salt and other seasonings, now to me, a fantastic cut of wagyu shouldn't be covered in salt and seasonings, the meat should be so good that you need to add very little to it.  When a place salts as much as this place did, I question their quality of meat.  On top of my wagyu filet being super salty, they brought out three more little cups of different salts.  Holy saltiness, I couldn't even consider adding any more salt to this meat.  My wife's regular filet that she ordered was way less salty and tasted better than my wagyu, which made paying the extra for mine a very sad tale.  Most likely I won't return because there is plenty of competition in Vegas that will indeed not make me regret ordering the wagyu.
It's all about ambience and service here.  I am usually more impressed by the these aspects of a posh Vegas restaurant but I expect premium food when paying top dollar.  . . The location is ideal and the place is happening.  The service is attentive and the sommelier is knowledgeable and precise.  However the bread apps weren't even warm, the sides were not impressive and the steak was over salty and underwhelming.  The sweat beans felt like they were drowned in sugar. The other sides very salty. The steak was an adequate texture slightly undercooked and very very salty.  . . I would give it another chance but would probably expect much of the same.
We usually don't go to steak houses. My husband is great on the grill, but tonight we ventured out to Cut, and Wolfgang Puck did not disappoint. Room inspiring, modern and trendy. Food and service top notch.Ben and Preston made our evening complete. Even the bread sticks are to die for. Fine dining all the way.
