I never have complaints at this place. Always nuce n spicy.  Customer service is usually on point. In my opinion far better than the other guys. If you havent chevked them out please do. It is worth the coin.
Well, we waited outside for about 20 minutes because it was so crowded. That's okay, the weather was nice. After we were seated And ordered, it was kind of a long wait but they were busy So I expected it. They brought out my husband's food first,and I had to wait for mine. When mine finally came out the sauce was delicious. I ordered the hot and juicy shrimp. The only thing I didn't like was having to peel the shrimp. But overall had a good time . . I would go back on a less busy night.
Whenever we come here, we are usually never disappointed. The sauce is amazing. I wouldn't be eating seafood if their sauce wasn't included. The crab legs and live Louisiana crawfish are the best items on their list. The price is surprisingly not that bad either. We ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish with a bowl of rice and paid 27 bucks. The crab and lobster are obviously more expensive but even then its worth it. Hot N Juicy medium sauce is the perfect heat and flavor. There are other sauces but Hot N Juicy sauce is a combination of all sauces and just has a much better flavor than competitors sauce such as Boiling Crab. Parking is a bit on the downside but they have 2 other locations in vegas with more leg room and car room if you prefer more space.
Saw this place on Man vs. Food and HAD to try it out during our vacation. It's noisy and fun, great service and great food. I'd never been to a place like that so it was fun to get messy. The crawfish were very tasty and filled me up just nice. I'd recommend trying it out at least once for the experience if you've never had it before.
I've driven passed this building thousands of times. I never really noticed it, until I went to New Orleans, and fell in love with crawfish! Then I saw it featured by Adam Richmond, on Man VS Food! I've been wanting to try it, ever since.. . Tonight, I was able to try it. I must say my favorite dish is Crawfish Etouffee! I was disappointed that they only offer it, as a side dish.. . I had a pound of Crawfish, which was fresh, tasty, but very hard to eat! I found myself struggling to get some meat! . . They serve it in a bag, with no utensils, so don't wear a long sleeve shirt, because it's messy. With that said, be prepared to freeze before getting your meal... I'm not sure why they run the AC so high, but once you dig in to your meal, it will warm you up.  . . I would suggest going in there with at least 3 people, and sharing. They offer more than crawfish. They have shrimp, lobster, oysters, and many forms of crab.. . They need to clean the bathrooms more! My wife told me the Women's bathroom was a mess, and when I went into the men's room,  I had to stand way back, to not step in pee.. . I look forward to going back. Although a few negative aspects of the place, the food is well priced, and delicious. It's the only place in town I've had fresh crawfish... So I have nothing to compare it to. I believe it's the only place in town that has crawfish flown in daily!
Hot n juicy doesn't disappoint,  what's best? Consistency...That's rare in this town. No it's not fancy, but that's what I like, nice place to let loose with the fam. The customer service is decent, as the restaurant gets busy almost every night at around 8pm. . I recommend the soft shell crab basket and obviously the shrimp, spicy is the way to go!
Food here is mediocre. Nothing special, had the shrimp with their seasoning that has everything (forgot the name) and it was bland. . . I also ordered a fried catfish basket and when all the food was brought out that was missing. Waitress said it'll be out soon. 10mins later I see another waitress give that order to a table that had come in AFTER we did and the waitress still said it was coming. She comes back 15mins later and says it was given to another table by mistake.. . Each time I asked her about it, she just seemed to ignore me. . . Only good thing that came out of the meal with my mom was that they didn't charge for the fried catfish after having me wait 30+minutes. Basically, I didn't get it until we had finished our meal.
I searched the food network and found man versus food. I searched for this restaurant. The shrimp was fresh and it was actually tasty. In regards to the cajun fries, it was in "pika." I had ordered the clams and they met the taste the I was looking for. . . I stayed here back in April and the service was inviting since the store closed and they still allowed me to pickup my to go food.
This place really Hits the spot when I am craving well season spicy shrimp with a side of corn. My whole family loves this place. I agree sometimes service is not all that great but it's a hit and miss just like in any other restaurant.
The workers here are very nice and their food here is delicious. We wanted to dine in but unfortunately we got to-go because it was too packed. I was disappointed that it took 45 to get our to-go orders. My advice is to call in and order and just bring it to-go.
