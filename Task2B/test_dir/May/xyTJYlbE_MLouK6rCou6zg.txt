With the price of food in Vegas this restaurant was very reasonable. The staff was extremely friendly even with our party of 35!! The food was pretty decent. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a decent priced and a pretty good burger.
Thanks to Rod U. for pointing out this place, his review is spot on.. . Perfectly executed burgers, right temperature, not too moist to make the bun soggy or too dry.  Quality ingredients - no fillers, good quality beef, steak fries are huge and crispy but soft inside.  They pay attention to details: the peppercorn sauce is separated.  After you finish your burger, you don't feel thirsty like the other places (don't know the reason for this, use of msg perhaps?). . Their milkshakes are classic, high quality ice cream is used, not too sweet.  Very smooth, that you can drink from your straw, no lumps at all.. . The only reason why it's not five stars is that it's a bit pricey for a burger, albeit it a perfectly executed one at that.  Expect to pay between $15 to $20 for one which includes fries.
a little pricey but its pretty good
The gluten free bun was actually worth the purchase/calories! Side note: Blue cheese was so good too! Highly recommend going here.
Hubert Keller was a visionary, all of a sudden burger places are the buzz.  Well this gem for years has been flipping fantastic burgers!  Even a vegetarian will enjoy, because they have a great veggie burger.  They even have a burger that can break your bank account which includes foie gras.  I can't forget to mention the great beer selection.  Their list is extensive both domestic and international.  It's location between the Mandalay Bay and Luxor is surrounded by fun shops, so if you have to wait for a table you can stay entertained.  Worth the visit!
Amazing burger in the shopping mall at Mandalay Bay! What a find. Sat at the bar, no wait, was a little noisy, but it was a bar with food in Las Vegas. Enough said.. . Worth the trip!
I am only giving this place a 2 star because our waitress did her best. It started off ok with putting in our names. we were told we would have a 10-20 min wait, I'm ok with that.it turned out to be 30 min with people who came after us being seated before us. we were a party of 2, pretty easy to seat. I got a migraine while waiting outside so long so when we were seated at a table in a noisy area I asked for a booth because they were a little enclosed, I was told we would have to wait another 10 at least. I told them I need to order a drink to take my medicine and couldn't wait any longer. we were told once we received something we couldn't change seats. so when our waitress came and I expressed my opinion she went to find the manager whom I told what happened. they gave me my drink then let us move tables. the food was just ok, the prices a bit high, I liked the burger bar at NEW YORK NEW YORK much better. we went there twice and perfect both times!
this was one of the first "gourmet" burger places I tried. well worth the visit, I am glad it has stood the test of time. . I must admit, I still enjoy a good in-and-out double double, but when you want to sit and have a good burger and a beer....or two or three, this is a place well worth the trip. . I usually have the lamb burger, and they do it well here. very nice and flavorful, not too gamey. and please, if you enjoy burgers, don't order them well done!. ruin the pleasure and taste of a great burger!. . the classic or Hubert Keller burgers are also a nice choices. . they do great fries here too, although to be fair, didn't care for the wings. but this is a burger place, right?. . there have been a number of burger joints that have opened up recently, but this one still remains one of my favorite choices!
Excellent burgers, great fries, exceptional selection of toppings and more types of milkshakes than one can imagine. The only problem I had with this place is that they have little TVs at each booth, which makes it too easy to bet Oklahoma City in the under only to watch the Clippers put up 100+ points on the road and kill my bet. Other than that-- great. . . Also, service-- from the friendly hostesses to the patient waiter-- was excellent. We spent $65 for three people (including tip) and had a great time and meal. Would have been better if Oklahoma City knew how to get some defensive rebounds, but so be it.
There are so many burger places in Vegas and my favorite is still Bachi Burger.. . So burger bar is a not too trendy burger joint located in Mandalay Bay. They have build your own burger concepts but we decided to be safe and ordered the hang over and the lamb burger. I've hadgreat lamb burgers in the past and this has got to be one of the most disappointing lamb burgers I've ever had for $20. As for the hang over, it's decent but it made me crave for in-n-out because it is the exact same burger except it is $13 versus $5. Everything was just underwhelming and lacking in bold rich flavors. At least the portion sizes were decent.. . They do have a build your own milkshake, but since I'm lactose intolerant, I'll pass on liquid death. :(. There are so many other options which makes it hard for me to recommend the Burger Bar.. . Overall, meh for me.
The Spicy Lamb Burger is phenomenal! It's funny how hard it was to decide which burger to get when they really only had about 6 to chose from. Everyone in our party ordered a different burger, and all were extremely happy with their choices. I will absolutely be going back here next time I'm in Vegas. The service was equally as great as their food. They also have small TVs in their booths playing sports which is a nice change from constantly having to look around at the TVs on the wall. Good place to have a great burger and enjoy a game.
GO BIG OR GO HOME!! Can you say it with me? GO BIG OR GO HOME!!. . When I came here for a late lunch and comparing other Yelp reviews, I have to say that to make one's visit more worth it here is to just try their Rossini burger, which costs a whopping $60. I am always looking for a better deal, so if you try their Build-Your-Burger and use the same ingredients, it actually costs about $6 more. Overall, the Rossini burger is your best option to try their foie gras, because it contains the best ingredients to make that burger POP and taste OH SO GOOD.. . So what did I think of it?. . We ordered two orders of the Rossini burger, which comes with Kobe style Wagyu beef with sauteed foie gras and shaved Black truffles and Black Perigold Truffle sauce on an onion bun. Frankly, I chose this burger only for the foie gras feature. Considering that duck liver is considered illegal in CA, I might as well make my trip to Vegas worth it and get it while it is still legal in Nevada!. . Let me just say that it is absolutely delicious! The patty and truffle were solid and flavorful with the foie gras. The foie gras was SO GOOD! Absolutely creamy and what one expects foie gras would taste like! We substituted our skinny fries for fat fries and ordered the Truffle Mayo dip - definitely try it! It's so good and the server gave us free extra Truffle Mayo dip! GREAAAT PLUS!! **. . As for desserts, we had the Pumpkin Spice milkshake to go. It tastes just like pumpkin pie. Yummy for those who are fans of pumpkin!. . Looking back, I would say that $60 is probably a bit too much, but I think it was more worth for the experience and to try the foie gras. So if you haven't been here, try this place at least once! When one is in Vegas, might as well go BIG or go HOME!! =)
Had burger bar for lunch, and was very underwhelmed. Got the build your own burger, ordered a chicken patty with avocado on a ciabatta bun and that is literally all i got. The chicken was way too big for the bun, and it was totally flavorless. Not to mention the wait times. It was a good 30-40 minutes after we ordered that the food finally came out. Service was good, but the kitchen needed to speed it up!
This place is cool! It was our first time on this restaurant, and the waiter suggested to us the buffalo burger. He said its lean and good for you. "Why not?" So that night, we ordered the buffalo burger with ingredients of Monterey Jack, red onion, and potato bun. It was our first time eating a buffalo meat. To me it tasted just like beef but lighter or not heavy in the stomach. The meat was medium done, so it has a little bet blood in the middle. It was very good but gamey.
Burger Bar has the best gluten free burger and fries I've eaten in a restaurant, hands down. I even checked with my server to make certain the bun they served was actually gluten free. (Hint, it's made with potato flour.) To finally enjoy an amazing burger with a soft, delicious GF bun and GF steak fries after a grueling day at a work conference was absolute heaven. The fact this restaurant is part of Huber Keller's culinary universe made it even better.. . Mid-afternoon, the joint was comfortably empty, and service was quite good. I had a booth all to myself, and was able to relax and watch the most recent episode of "Game of Thrones" on my iPhone via HBO GO, thanks to the free Wi-Fi at Mandalay Bay. And I enjoyed an O'Mission GF pale ale with my feast. The pickle and house-made dijon mustard were added bonuses and a nice complement to my meal.. . If you're not GF, there are so many more options! I highly recommend checking out Burger Bar if you're in Las Vegas.
Every second is a highlight. When we touch don't ever let me go. Dirty dancing in the moonlight. Take me down like I'm a domino at BURGER BAR! - Jessie J (domino). . Hubert Keller and burger...what? I think it's an excellent choice for either lunch or late afternoon. There's a 'build your own burger' option that appeals to many people. The milkshakes looked good too, but didn't feel like it that day (summer approaching!). . . I very much enjoyed my burger here at Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay. The bun was especially well done and all the condiments that it came with were crisp. The burger came with shoestring fries, but I would probably substitute and try one of the many other fries options. I was sort of in a rush so yeah, I kept it short and simple and had a satisfying burger without any fuss.
I met an out of town friend here for dinner before the Michael Jackson One show.  I've been wanting to try the Burger Bar and it was convenient for having dinner and getting to the 7 o'clock show.. . I had read reviews of friends on Yelp and had decided what I was going to get before I got there.  Then I looked at the menu there and I changed my mind.  While we were studying the menu, our server brought our drinks and he kept my iced tea refilled during the meal.. . I opted for the Hubert Keller burger which is ground buffalo meat.  It's topped with caramelized onions, bleu cheese, and baby spinach served on a ciabatta bun.  Finally, it's served with a red wine and shallot sauce which the menu states is Keller's favorite sauce.  I ordered the burger rare.  The server asked if I wanted it cool inside and yes was my answer.  . . It was served exactly the way I wanted it--red, cool meat.  The burger was very tasty and very juicy.  It was better buffalo than I've had in the past.  I also got a side of skinnyfries which were good but nothing special.  It was also a small amount for the price.  As for Chef Keller's favorite sauce, I didn't find it all that flavorful.  I poured some on the burger and some on the bun but I got no flavor of cooked wine and shallots.. . This is a good burger joint.  The place was crowded and noisy when we got there, but the crowd thinned out as we were there.  I guess I know how to clear a room.  I'd like to try his foie burger.  Had I known that when I went to the casino before the show I'd hit a $120 bonus, I'd have gotten the foie burger.  Oh well, another time.
Food was amazing! Large menu with pretty much anything you could imagine wanting to put on your burger and even bigger beer menu! I ordered just an angus beef burger with proscuitto, truffle mayo and parm and for not having many ingredients it was hands down the best burger I have ever had! My boyfriend got a burger with many more items on it and also thoroughly enjoyed it.  Service was great also and a fun atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back!
Our first night's stay in Vegas landed us at Burger Bar for dinner.  With so many options for great/gourmet burgers, we chose Burger Bar for it's location between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor (where we were staying) and were not disappointed.  My wife ordered the sliders and I built my own burger - Lamb on ciabatta, with spinach, grilled onions, and provolone.  Our burgers were delicious and cooked perfectly.  My wife commented on how impressed she was at their ability to cook sliders to medium well.  . We sat at the bar and had great service. Atmosphere is casual and fun.  Definitely recommend.
Kobe beef burger....mmmm mmm good! I've had that burger both times I've eaten here as well as a side of sweet potato fries.  I usually load my burger up with cheddar cheese, blue cheese, onion, bacon, and the basic lettuce/mayo.  . I was first told about this place from a friend who thought I ought to try it since I had expressed my love of burgers and lived in Las Vegas for so long.  Although this place is pricey (it's costed between $70-$100 each time I've gone with one other person) it's well worth it if you're craving a fabulous burger and it's a date night!(:
Great selection of beers get this place it's 2 stars but that's where all the fun stops... . -Waitress was less than enthusiastic . -ordered slider trio, comes with fries.. With all these good reviews about how good the burgers are I thought this place would be perfect but these were definitely the worst sliders I've ever had. Dry dry dry.
Great burgers - really high priced though. My burger was huge and cooked to perfection. The fries were decent and the onion rings even better. We ate here for lunch and the place wasn't overly busy for a Monday afternoon. We didn't order alcohol but from the looks of things there is a good drink selection.
