One of the cheaper hotels for our group to stay in, so we picked this place. I have always enjoyed European decor, so I fell in love with this place. We had two double queen rooms, which were more than enough room for all of us. The view from our room was beautiful, the room was cleaned, the bathroom was very pretty. We didn't stay very long in our rooms, really only to sleep, so it did the job for us. I really enjoyed walking downstairs, as it mimicked a French road. We dined at the buffet, at the pizza shoppe, and at the cafe. Free alcohol when you gamble (so I went as slow as I could in order to get some free drinks). Pool was beautiful and clean. All of the service women and men were very nice and attentive toall of us.
It has quite the atmosphere lot of things going on around you A couple things I don't really like are the root pit bosses and the cocktail waitresses seem kind of rude not very friendly for such a Great atmosphere I've I'm there often and I'll keep checking up and update this review but as of now I was just there on Thursday in May Will also be returning on may 9, 2014 so I'll check it and see if any attitude has changed the great thing is is a very gay friendly hotel the pool and Jacuzzi are very clean and meet the lifeguards and the host outside are very friendly I wish it would take that good atmosphere and friendly staff on the pool area and bring it on in to the main floor but don't want to be too negative it's not a good thing I would try again but don't let that discourage you go check it out for yourself once again that this was only my opinion but my group that I was with absolutely agrees with everything I'm saying so check it out for yourself and let me know,
The check in process was not only confusing, (when you get there and see the way the lines are set up, you'll see) But, whatever.   . . The issue I really had was the attitude of the check-in staff.  We wanted to check in 2 hours early.  But, apparently, even if the room was sitting and ready, this calls for a service charge. I literally felt like I was dealing with a cold hearted stripper.  (No joke) No smile, just a demand for my credit card for services not even rendered yet. . . The toilet overflowed and we had to ask them to mop it up.  The Paris didn't even offer to pay for the items destroyed by it.  We had to insist they do something about it.  Grudgingly, they took off the service charge for arriving too early.  Gee, thanks guys.. . Again, there was no apology.  What the heck?!  What kind of customer service is this?  I believe they're taking this 'French theme' to the extreme here.... . Well, it looks like I'll be crawling back to my first love--Bellagio! My husband and I have never experienced attitudes and service issues there.  They've always treated us very well. . . Bellagio, WHY did I ever leave you in the first place?  Oh yeah.  The rates.  . . Well, sometimes (especially in this town) it's worth paying a little more.  Lesson learned.
Top Highlights and Lowlights. . 1) super friendly and accommodating staff. 2) hotel is a little dated. 3) great location on the strip. . I stayed at the Paris hotel for a week for business. I booked a king standard room but when I arrived they were out of that room style so they gave me a room with two double beds and an Eiffel Tower view. I also had to leave about 15 items at the bell desk for co-workers and the staff was really accommodating. The view was great! The room wasn't anything super special and a little dated but nice overall with a pretty big bathroom. . . There are a few good restaurants and bars in the hotel including Mon Ami Gabi and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. There is also a piano bar, Napoleans, that had some really talented pianists in the week I was there. There is also a club, Chateau here. The club is probably not a top club in Vegas but the view from the "rooftop" deck is great and the DJs were great the few times I went.. . The location of the hotel is great, it is in the middle of the strip so you can walk almost anywhere. The hotel is connected to Ballys so you can get to monorail station withouthaving to walk outside. . . I really enjoyed my stay here! Less expensive than some of the other hotels on the strip but still good service and amenities.
Ugh.. . 40" to check in (and check out).. . $20 charge if you want to check in before 3 PM.. . You'll be asked to pay even if your room is vacant and available.. . You'll be asked to pay even if you attempt to check in at 2:45 (PM not AM). . Clueless, indifferent staff.. . Worn carpets, dirty public bathrooms and claustrophobic elevators.. . Loud, poorly maintained rooms.. . Activities fee added to each bill, regardless if you use their gym or crowded pool.. . $5 charge to print your boarding pass. . . Really??. . Save yourself from endless aggravation, stay in a hotel where management and staff take pride in customer service.
Awful. Really just awful. . . -Staff members were extremely rude. For example, we were standing by the bar waiting for drinks for 15 minutes. Not one bartender acknowledged us. So, I politely asked the bartender who was cleaning glasses, if he could help us. He told us he was busy and we should go to the other side of the bar. . -Rarely saw a waitress in the casino. So, we had to go back to the bar and get our own drinks. Lame.. -The rooms felt like a cheap chain motel, rather than a Vegas experience. The room really wasn't clean. When we opened the armoire to watch TV and found old food and snacks. Gross! Super loud at all times of day or night. Old room service trays sat in the hallways for more than 24 hours. I even watched hotel employees walk right by the tray and do nothing about it.. - Their activities fee is lame. You pay to use their gym and pool through this fee. There is not an option to skip thee fee by not using the gym or pool. . -Overly aggressive sales people every ten feet. After we checked in we had to walk through the casino/shopping area to get to our room. I was hassled by this woman (who had a leathery wrinkled face) trying to sell me a makeover and her anti-wrinkle products. I said no thanks and walked away. She followed me, yelling how I should get this makeover. She just wouldn't let it go. I swear I thought she would follow me to my room.. - Their internet is a joke. It only somewhat works in the room, but mostly not. Plus, you can only use it one one device. I just used LTE. . - Hubby got bad food poisoning from the mussels he ate at one of their restaurants (LaProvencial) . We ate and drank exactly the same things except the mussels. I was fine. Just a rotten way to end a vacation.. . Will never, ever be going back here again for any reason.
First of all, if you do not smoke do not even consider the smoking optional floor. Our room smelled like the inside of a coal miner's sock. . . They moved us to a nicer room which was ok, the young lady at the desk, Amber I think, was very sweet and helpful. . . The bar inside the Paris, not sure of the name just look for the empty bar, has the honor of having made two of the worst drinks I have ever tried, and they were quite a bit more expensive than other nicer bars. . . We moved to the Mandalay Bay so all is well. Don't go to the Paris.
I've been to vegas I don't even know how manytimes, too many! but I've never stayed at paris until my most recent trip, for some reason I always thought of it as a "ghetto" hotel. I decided to give it a shot this time since the prices were so low and I really didn't care much for the hotel on this trip. . . to my surprise it was actually pretty nice! I would put it in similar level as TI, of course this isn't as nice as venetian/wynn/ecore but if you can get a great deal this is definitely a great place to stay, rooms were roomy and clean and the pool is actually really nice! (the Eiffel tower overlooks the pool). . my biggest complaint is the staff, checking in and checking out, SLOW AS HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL honestly the lines were all the way to the casino, and they aren't the nicest either. I highly recommend checking in and out at non-peak hours so you don't have to wait
I had no problem checking in. The lady who checked us in was so friendly and patient. So good customer service so far. . . The wear and tear for 14 years around the hotel is noticeable so taking a star away for that. . . The hotel room smelled like flowers so that was a nice touch. . . The furniture is descent and goes with the Parisian theme. . . The view is spectacular from our room. I can see the people in the pool and enjoy the architecture of the Eiffel tower. I can also clearly see the Bellagio water show. . . I can hear the music from the pool area all the way up to the twenty fourth floor. So that kinda sucks. The insulation needs to be better. . . The shops in the lobby are fun to explore so that's a plus. I can always grab a crepe or strawberry daiquiri and be pleasantly pleased. :)
For the price, I have nothing to complain.. . Room is okay, you can sleep there with no problem. The one we got probably was on a club side or something.. we could hear club music until 3AM, which is not so good.. . Their buffet was nice. I got the Groupon, so it was a good value.. . The casino is old looking. I can imagine it was one of the coolest casino on the strip at one time.
My husband and I decided to stay an extra night at the last minute and we found a deal for $42.00 so we couldn't pass up the chance to stay here.  Although there was a long line at check in (expected) the line moved quickly and all available check in windows were open. The lady who checked us in was very polite and friendly. The hotel itself is very nice, the decor is beautiful and it was very clean. The bartenders were super friendly and fun. When you step outside the Bellagio is right across the street and the water show is visible.  The location of the hotel was great. . . Our room was really nice, the bed was comfortable, the AC got nice and cold, there was a refrigerator and a TV on the wall. The bathroom had both a shower and a tub which was nice. . . Overall we really enjoyed our stay here. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the walk from the garage to Registration is kind've far and not fun with bags. Every time you want to go to your car it's a pretty long walk. I would recommend using valet when you check in. If your there for a few nights use the garage and then valet again the night before you leave so you can take your bags straight to the front. Much easier!
Gustavs bar smelled so bad we had to leave-disgusting--Very bad moldy/sweaty/stale beer smell: the 'dancers' at the tables were so lame and acted like they didn't want to be there:  I expected a higher class in this casino-but it was as low as you can go. May as well go to Fremont street
UGH NEVER AGAIN. . . We stayed in a "supposedly" suite. YOU CALL THAT A SUITE?! Paris, you need to get your eyes checked and redo those rooms. I will never stay here again. . . CONS:. -terrible customer service. -no view whatsoever. -boring, small casino.. . . The only ONLY good thing about this hotel is that it's right across Bellagio and smack dab right in the middle of the strip. The only good thing. Sad really. . . oh yeah, no free wifi. terrible.
While both the outside and inside of the hotel is very nice (let's be honest, it's no Venetian or Bellagio), the problem I have with this hotel is their very shady  "e-upgrade" policy.  . . They sent us an email for us to optionally get on an e-upgrade standy list.  Who doesn't want a better room, right?  However, at no time during check in were we informed that we got an upgrade - even the nightly rate card that I initialed did not indicate an updated room.  The room itself was fairly average size, double queen beds and one regular chair for a sitting area, with some obvious issues (stains on the carpets, rust in the bathtub, old soap stains in the shower, non-working TV remote, terrible view of a parking deck).  But then, during check out, we noticed that the bill had some "upgrade fees" totaling about $50 per night tacked on seemingly out of nowhere.   To me, this is completely DISINGENUOUS, bordering on downright  fraud.  If you're not told you're getting an upgrade, how can they charge you for an upgrade?  . . Well, this experience at the check out desk totally ruined this hotel for me and I want everyone who reads this to be aware of this shady business practice.  Beware the e-upgrade!
