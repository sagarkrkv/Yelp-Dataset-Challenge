Place is to cramped. Food is not great, Jesse silva you ruined my life with this place. Service was ok.
AYCE sushi for $25. As good as can be expected.. . We started with the seafood salad prepared spicy which was our favorite dish. There's a heaping portion of cubed and sliced sashimi of tuna, yellowtail, and salmon. The spicy sauce was slightly tart and did not overpower the fish. . . We also had some sashimi, Harry potter roll, hamachi kama, wet dream roll, and the soft shell crab appetizer (which was overlooked). . . You can have one mochi and two icecreams per person with the all you can eat. We enjoyed a chocolate mochi, vanilla mochi, and a plum ice cream.
WARNING!  Horrible!!!  My boyfriend has been talking about this place since his visit to Vegas last year.  After our party of 3 was sat at a 2 top and asked to deal with it I was already annoyed.  After ordering and having our drinks brought to us, we were asked to stand up and move.  We initially thought "Great! They are moving us to a larger table!"  Too bad that wasn't the case.  Instead they had us move to another to a 2 top table!!!! Are you kidding me?!?! Then after my boyfriend got his food he and finished 3 pops he found a dead fly embedded into his lemon.  They tried to claim it came in from outside and landed on their food therefore it's not their problem.  WTF kind of thinking is that?!?!!!! They refused to comp his food, and only offered to take it off his drink order.  Calling Health Department now!  We canceled my order before it even got to the table.
Overall, great place to go off strip for sushi as long as you arent expecting Michelin star quality food.  . . Fish is fresh, and often times cut right in front of you if you sit at the sushi bar!  . . Always a stop for me when in vegas :)
I was trying to come here last year with some of my colleagues from out of country but they were too impatient to wait and went to the place next door which we regretted big time.  Anyways we came here Sunday May 4th around lunch time ending the weekend for my cousin's 21st birthday bash.  It happened that he found this restaurant using the Yelp app and I remembered that I tried coming here before.  I knew it must have been a good Sushi spot since there was a line outside the door when we tried coming during dinner last time.  There were 6 of us and the hostess was quick to get us seated even though the place looked pretty packed but no line outside the door this time.  They ended up seating us on the left side near the front.  It kinda looked like a mini room and there were 2 sets of tables in that little area enough to sit the 6 of us and these cute Korean ladies on the next table.  There was 1 small TV in there..it was playing Inception and I remember another TV in the larger dining area airing the basketball game.  I didn't get to see the other room since this is our first time being in there.  Our waitress' name was Ellen I believe.  She was quite the comedian.  She was quick to give us the popular rolls and side orders.  The name of the special rolls are hilarious...One Minute Man, Man Whore, Wet Dream, Son of the Beach, Happy Ending,   I freakin love the names.  We decided to do A.Y.C.E. just as the ladies did next to us....my brother asked them that's how we knew.  We ordered the Sashimi Salad for an appetizer.  I would recommend that to anyone.  There was almost 0 greens in that salad.  It was mostly just the sashimi and the special Yama sauce that they wouldn't sell to us even if we begged them to.  We ended up ordering 4 more orders later on of that deliciousness.  We also had the special rolls I mentioned above and some nigiri as well.  Uni was nice and fresh.  We'll definitely hit this spot up again and again when we come to Vegas.  Only thing I regret is not opening my mouth when the ladies next to us talked about visiting San Diego soon...lol.
This place is very small and cramped but LOVE the food and the all you can eat sushi. I've been here more than a dozen times and have never been disappointed. Service is great and so is the food. If you are looking for great sushi and not ambience, this place is perfect.
If you are looking for AYCE go to Yama.. lunch is $22 and dinner is $25, I  HIGHLY recommend the seafood salad as a starter! This place is a little hole in the wall on flamingo but it is worth the drive! . The place gets busy and they do not take reservations so if you have a big party make sure most of your group shows up together or they wont seat you. They recently expanded so there is more seating and they have two sushi bars instead of one. They are usually pretty quick with making your orders, like I said they get really busy it might take a little longer during dinner and weekends. Plan accordingly. Worst part is the wait, ive waited upwards of 30 minutes, but the sushi is worth it!
This is my favorite sushi place in town. The Sun of a Beach and Wet Dream roll are to die for. I'm a sushi fanatic and haven't found many places in town taste-wise that compare to Yama. I would totally give them 5 stars if the wait times weren't so long :(. Seating is extremely limited and you could sit and wait for over an hour without a reservation.
Prices: (AYCE). Lunch 11-3pm $20.95. Dinner 3-11pm $$23.95. . For a very cheap all you can eat sushi and GOOD quality fish, this place is the best place to go! It's a hidden gem away from the strip. I have to say this is my second favorite spot.. it would be my first if they had  all you can eat sashimi, but it toes very very close to Hikari.. . Service can be a little better, but I don't blame them. This place is always so busy! A very, very popular local fav! . . I love the sushi roll names! Some examples: One Night At Yama, Yo Sexy, Man Whore, Dancing In The Sheet, Strip Tease, Oh Dam!!!Harry, Kiss The Ass... just to name a few! Do you see their style and theme of sushi roll names? Haha it's very funny when you order them out loud. It is definitely a topic starter and a fun way to entertain your group at the table!. . Their sides are amazing. I can't stress enough how fresh the fish is. I LOVEEE IT! Everything here is amazing! Must try place in Vegas!
This place serves delicious sushi. They are expedient with orders too. My only issue is that they are so incredibly busy, that the servers rushing orders take away from the dining experience. It almost feels like a "factory" Get in and get out. And you're rushing in between.  The space is really small so go somewhere else if you want an intimate meal because you are less than an arm's length from the table next to you.
The Wet Dream roll. That's really all I have to say. Ok so the all you can eat deal is excellent, plenty for the price, the spicy seafood salad and soft shell crab is fantastic. We enjoyed more rolls than I could count, and they do offer them in smaller portions so you can experience more of the menu. Strawberry mochi was delicious! Maybe we were there at the right time or it was just a good night but the fish tasted fresh and service was quick. However, they do lose one star because service is...I hate to say it...horrible, to the extent of nonexistent.  Very rushed, impersonal, and it did feel like they wanted us to hurry up, eat, and get out. Bummer when you're paying $25 a person. The only person who appeared to not hate their job was the busboy who was extremely friendly and helpful. But the sushi was excellent, and because of that I'll be back.
Totally worth a visit.  This is the best AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas!  . . For a relatively cheap price, you get good quality sushi.  They even have Uni here (one order per person).  We really liked the salmon nigiri here.  They do put a lot of rice in their nigiri though.  :(. . Service:  Service was okay.  I can't say they were friendly or even nice...but they were efficient.  They don't give you a piece of paper to mark your orders like other AYCE sushi places.  You just tell them what you want.  It's a smart system because it prevents over-ordering.  The food comes out really quickly. . . Ambience:  Decent.  Nothing special.  All the sushi chefs were wearing mouth and nose guards which increases cleanliness (huge plus here!!).  . . Location:  Located in a strip mall near the strip.  Plenty of parking!. . My new favorite AYCE sushi place in Las Vegas!!  I can't wait to come back!
Oh, Yama. Where do I even begin. Every time I am in Vegas, I absolutely HAVE to eat here. It's that good. I realize that being from Texas, it's not exactly a sushi mecca, nor do I claim to be an expert by any means, however, Yama deserves a solid 4 stars from me for everything from their sushi to their service.. First things first, you're almost guaranteed a wait when you go here. Note that I've only gone for dinner, not lunch, so I can't comment on that. I'd suggest venturing to the questionable yet ever so fun Dottie's next door, where you can play slots/video poker until your table is ready, and the hostesses will actually come and find you there. Awesome. Speaking of table, I've never sat at one. I've always opted for the sushi bar. If you can, head to the bar in the new addition over on the right. Trust. . After sitting down, order the AYCE. Because why would you do it any other way. The AYCE includes all of their rolls, specialty rolls, hand rolls, sushi, etc, PLUS, the seafood salad that you absolutely must try. Get it spicy. And thank me later. I think my favorite rolls are the Wet Dream and No Name. I also love getting the white tuna, when they have it, and you have to end your meal with some mochi. . Love Yama. Love everything about it. Definitely give it a shot if you're in Vegas. You'll be happy you did!
Excellent service and great food!. The all you can eat has a huge selection and if you want more than 2 specialty rolls then it's more than worth the cost.
Been here before, sat at the bar, and it was good.  Tonight we brought family and it's terrible.  We waited for 30 min for food and it's not good at all.  Edamame came out last and it's over cooked.  Nigiri is flavorless and the cooked rolls took forever.  On top of that, service is terrible.  Our waiter is very nice but clearly spread too thin because we haven't seen him in about 15 minutes.  Probably not coming back unless we're desperate.
Great experience here food was great second time coming here from cali and best sushi I ate so.far brought the family  and everybody was pleased with service and food all you can eat is definitely worth it started with soft shell crab ,sushi , bbq ribs ,and finish of with delicious mochi vanilla & mango ice cream you will enjoy
Orders are slow, tasting is good but not amazing and is so noisy, you need order all at time because is very slow .... Waitress forget the order .... i don't understand how have a four stars ....
Crowded but there a reason,  fresh sushi and good. We had a large group of people and had a great time. It will be a regular eating spot when iam in Vegas. Would have given fuve stars if the waitress spoke better English.  Few mix ups with orders but it was crowded and they were genuinely trying their best.
Great service, great food. Lines can get long and the area is a little sketchy looking. Really nice inside the restaurant though
Not exactly one of my top five choices comes too AYCE sushi. But am always willing too try restaurant once with open mind. I had friends visiting ones that not so much yelpers yelpers but enjoy reading reviews and notice the four stars never been so wanted too give it try. Hell yay! Really all about hanging out with family/friends in life. . . We went early since it was holiday weekend plus went on friday night. My friends arrived earlier since it on the opposite town for me. Talk about making first impression is that they let my friends sit down before I arrived. I know some of my favorite sushi spots they won't let you sit down if whole party not together. Once we got sat down looking at the menu really not much different then any other AYCE. I am not much into the speciality rolls more of nigiri. Talk about nice size portion of fish on the nigiri. My taste actually not good thing or my sushi spots non of them cut the fish that thick. I understand people thinking more fish getting better deal looks better. The thing I found at Yama is bigger or thicker cuts not always mean better. I felt like the quality of the fish, and just the overall freshness very blah average at best. The sushi rice was really sub par for me. It lacked any kind of vinegar or just felt like plain rice. Since I had no idea that the fish was cut on the thicker side ordered 12 orders of nigiri too start thinking good kick start. Our waitress like yay that lot. True cause after that had no room too try more of the menu more less any speciality rolls. I did get in green tea ice cream. Good. Again had better at other sushi restaurants. Overall since such competitive market of AYCE and Yama on the opposite side of town stick too the ones I like best.. . The service was great definitely four stars comes too never have empty glass. Talk about bringing out the sushi. I was surprise how fast our first round came out between the three of us ordering good round.
I came here with a buddy from the navy cause he wanted to try it out. he kept saying it was authentic sushi due to reviews but hey heres what I think.  Theres only one place I have tried with authentic sushi that ships their fish from japan but ill save that for another review. . . Here at yama the food is good. They make lots of different rolls and when you order something else besides rolls its probably a wrap thats similar to rolls.  inside out roll. .  . If youre here, you have to order the seafood salad and the "palmjob" or handjob something like that =p. These are the only two items that stick out in my mind that I now its good...so try those!. Our recent visit was not a good experience because they were closing. And when theyre closing, they also close the kitchen forcing everyone else to order so much. We ended up ordering so much also that we had to pay extra; but on the positive note we got to take the rest of the rolls home lol.. . My advice to anyone that would like to try it out is to make sure you order those 2items I mentioned above and also be there before they close.
Very good AYCE place. The service is very attentive and welcoming. This place is BUSY!!
Love the AYCE of the entire menu, including drinks, apps, dessert, everything! And love their specialty rolls, particularly "sex on the beach" and "wet dream".
We found Yama sushi from a yelp search. It east of the strip and NO TOURIST.  A very local place.  We are not from Vegas and took a cab for $15.00. We paid $24.00 for all you can eat. Very fast service and great wait staff.  I was very happy with the rolls.  There might be a wait but it's because it's a great place. . . Save the $200 that you would spend at Nabu and go to Yams Sushi
