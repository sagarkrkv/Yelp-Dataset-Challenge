The only bad thing about this place is that I can't afford to go every single day! EVERYTHING on their menu is soooooo good!  Was so god we went back 2 nights in a row.
After a fun, alcohol filled night, my friends and cousins decide to hit up LoLo's.  I hadn't been here since they were just a back room to somebody's kitchen so seeing the expansion gave me high hopes because it presented itself nicely...the interior is the ONLY thing that presents itself well.. . We walk in and the unenthusiastic hostess asked how many was in our party and I told her 8.  Being that the rest of the party live further, it would take them a while, so she informed us she can't seat half of our party until the full 8 showed up. Ugh yeah, right. I'm hungry and I'm not waiting so we just asked to be seated for our four. So after letting her know it would just be us for, she writes my name and instructs me to "scoot"  to the side and sit down. In slow motion, I turn around and all of the waiting benches are taken soooo where the hell am I suppose to sit, on the older ladies lap that was already sitting there?! She could have easily said "it will just be a few moments, if you'd like you can take a seat that's available behind you". Was that too difficult?! So I say whatever, they sat us within the next two minutes.. . Our waiter/manager of the restaurant takes our drink orders and he seemed pretty cool cuz he was joking a lil with us.  So my cousin asks if she can put in an order for someone who was showing up a little later and then that's when things went down hill.  We were informed we couldn't do that because it would be cold by the time he came and blah blah blah.  Brotha, that's another order which results into money into your business' pocket.  So we order our food but he let's us order for our cousin who would show up late.  So we place the order and literally 5 minutes later, a different server comes out and says "UM this is for someone showing up late or somethin".  Ok, so you mean to tell me there was a discussion about this tiny little request in your kitchen amongst several servers.  Not to mention our order hadn't even come out yet, so the "complicated" order was first to come out when our orders were the smallest.  My friend asks why my cousins order came out so fast and why we haven't received ours, so that's when the title of this review comes in "ma'am we cook chicken and waffles all day, some orders will be quicker than others". Huh?! I know I didn't major in computer science but this really wasn't THAT complex.  So luckily my cousin walks in just in time to eat his food so it didn't get cold like Mr. Manager/Waiter/Host/Fry Cook (he seriously wore many hats) mentioned. . . I don't wanna come to a place to eat when there's all these rules and instructions beginning with who and how many people can sit with me.  Being a California native, Roscoe's will always be THE Chicken & Waffles place that dominates any other competition.  Compared to Roscoe's, this place is amateur.  At least with Scoes they seat you no matter what time your party arrives, your food comes out within 5-10 minutes from the time you place your order, and you have a server who is just that...a server.  Not the building instructor, valet attendant or whatever our so called 'server' was to us.  This place will never get my business ever again.
I've grown up on Roscoe's Chicken in waffles but I enjoyed this place so much more. Plus you don't smell like chicken when you leave Score!
4.5 stars! . . To borrow a phrase from George Takei, oh my! We finally tried this place out after hearing about it from several of our friends and coworkers who have lived in the area for quite some time. We read a few reviews, liked what we saw, and made it a point to go. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and shown to our table. The decor is sort of a modern meets rustic look.  . . Our waitress Leslie came right over and took our drink order.  The menu is huge, and we wanted to try everything on it. Needless to say it took us a few minutes to make our decisions, but then we were ready to bring on the hurt. We knew then that this was simultaneously going to be both the best and worst decision ever for dinner. My wife ordered the Lo Lo's chicken and waffles, I ordered the 8 double D's chicken breast and waffle, and we got an order of fries and corn bread to share. We also ordered two drinks off of their specialtymenu, a Keep it Simple for my wife, and the tropical drink for me. Sadly, I can't remember the name of the drink. . . The fries and the corn bread came out first.  The corn bread was good, but not the best I've had. The fries are hand cut with a glorious seasoning.  Anyone who knows me well knows my unhealthy obsession with french fries...It's rivaled only by my love of tacos. The fries never stood a chance. Every now and then I would pause for half a second to dip one in ketchup, but they were so good they really didn't need it. Shortly thereafter the rest of the food came out.. . The main course came out on large dishes that were roughly the size of trampolines. My inner fat kid was practically leaping up and down at this point. The amount of food piled on the plates bordered on unnatural. It was about this time that my wife and I realized we may have ordered too much food. We didn't care. We were too busy staring down our plates like two gunslingers before a high noon showdown and furiously snapping photos for our future Yelp post. Our stomachs grumbled with anticipation.. . The chicken was delicious, juicy, and breaded and fried southern style. The waffles were soft and made to order with their special batter. I went all out, ripping my chicken breast off the bone and stuffed it in the waffle, loaded it with butter, syrup, and hot sauce. With a big grin on my face, I folded it up like a giant delicious taco and ate it like it was my last meal on earth. My inner fat kid was getting worried at this point, because he knew there was more to come. Syrup and butter streaming down my hands, I enjoyed it to the last crumb. The waffle split and threatened to spill its contents all over the table several times, but I'm no amateur taco eater. The hot sauce is medium, with a little bit of a kick but not too much, and a nice spicy offset to the sweetness of the syrup.  . . Throughout the course of our meal, our table was visited several times by our waitress and other staff members. They kept the drinks filled and cleared away finished plates. Everyone was friendly and made for a great service experience.. . To finish it off, we ordered the banana pudding for dessert. No true Southerner can pass up banana pudding when given the choice. I grew up on my grandma's banana pudding, so there was a high bar of expectations set. I was not disappointed. The style was different from that of my grandmothers, but it was still very good. They use crumbled vanilla wafers as both a base and a topping. As with the drinks, it comes out served in a large mason jar. Be warned, it's a big serving, so come hungry or be ready to share.  My wife threw in the towel about a quarter of the way through. Rookie.  I tore through it like a Serengeti Lion devouring its prey.. . My hunger sated and my inner fat kid crying for mercy, I lay down my fork and napkin in victory. I'm fairly certain I ate the equivalent of two days caloric intake. with a smile on my face, I thought dreamily of the Tums sitting on my nightstand at home.
Im from Atlanta Ga , and we know good down home cooking. When I tell you this food is good.... it's a understatement. The food and the people are outstanding! The only thing I can compare this food to is "family reunion food" and if you're from the south you know what i mean ....
This is for sure a must have if you're new to phoenix! The thing is that the remodel is beautiful. They do have another location in Scottsdale,however this one I would say is the better one. Its very clean. The servers are great and friendly. . . You cannot go wrong with any thing you order here. It's really all good. You will find something for everyone.
Love the food, but they changed to mandatory valet parking.. fail x 100. . Really? Why? . . Fix this! At least one of the two lots should be self parking.
Enjoyed the yummy southern food, waitress was very hospitable and the family love Lo-Lo's chicken & Waffles. Busy but worth the wait. Ordered the Tre-Tre and sweet candy.
Having been a bookmark on my Yelp account for some time now, we finally got the chance to try this place out! We headed in and were greeted right away. We didn't have a reservation, but we lucked out and got there earlier than the rush, so we were seated in a nice booth up front.  The place filled up pretty quickly after we arrived, so I would recommend calling ahead if you have a larger party (and they only seat your party once everyone has arrived, so keep that in mind, too).. . Our waitress was Leslie and she was wonderful from the very start.  Friendly and accommodating she allowed us a bit of time to look over the menu and made recommendations based on our preferences, which worked out nicely.  I had the Lo-Lo's meal and he had the Double D meal, we shared an order of cornbread, cause...who turns down southern style cornbread?? We opted to try out a couple of their drinks which I cannot remember the names of, but they were good! . . The meals came out quickly an were exactly the way we ordered them and they smelled amazing. Chicken was cooked nicely and the breading was really well seasoned. Waffles were fluffy and perfect. The cornbread was gone within seconds of hitting the table. . . Despite being way too full for it, we shared a banana pudding for a dessert, which was worth every agonizingly over full bite! I highly recommend this if you from the south and like a good banana pudding with real slices of banana and wafer topping!. . Overall: A+. Great service, great southern food with hilarious names (amazing dessert for a bonus), and fun ambiance make this place a "will absolutely return" venue!
Everything looked and smelled great. Unfortunately, everyone around me got served (even those that were seated later). After leaving (lunch break was up), the manager on the phone said it was because I ordered chicken breast. Note to self, order what they have available, not what you really want to try. The manager DID apologize, but only after I asked him to acknowledge that they were wrong. Although I'm not a dentist, I feel like one having to pull teeth to get some courtesy out of Lo-Lo's Chicken (thighs) and Waffles.
Lo Lo chicken and Waffles will be removed from my "places to eat while traveling" list forever.  The first one I went to was in Scottsdale, I happily gave it 5 stars and told my friends and colleagues about this place and that Lo Lo's is a must visit.  A couple of months later, I went back again and OMG!!! What happened???!!!! I got the game hen version.  The drumstick was 4" long and not even 2" wide (I've posted pictures) so wrote a scathing review considering I looked at the other people chicken and it was twice the size of what me and my family got!  . . So my husband and Are in AZ for the next couple of days and I decided to let Lo Lo's redeem themselves.  We went to the Lo Lo's on Central Ave. AlI can say is that Lo Lo's have been removed from my list!
My significant other and I came on a busy weekend around lunch time. There was a free valet. The place was packed, so we waited around an hour or so for a table. While we waited, there was a comfy seating area outside and water. . . Once we were seated, we ordered the famous soul food platter to share (where you pick an entree and two sides, and this includes cornbread), along with a red koolaid. We picked the 3 pieces of chicken smothered in gravy & onions for the entree, along with a waffle and mac & cheese for our two sides.. . Chicken smothered in gravy and onions:. Maybe it was because I was so hungry by then, but this tasted absolutely delicious. Hot, savory, and crunchy, this chicken lived up to the hype. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and the gravy and onions added a nice salty (but not overwhelming) complement to the crunchy chicken. . . Waffle:. The waffle was great, and also lived up to the hype I expected, as this is one of the signature dishes. It was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The actual size of the waffle looks bigger in photos, probably because the plate is smaller than I imagined, but one waffle is still quite an adequate amount for one person. My SO said this was the best waffle he's ever had. . . Mac & cheese:. This was disappointing. The mac and cheese tasted grainy to me, and the sauce was lumpy rather than smooth. The cheese sauce didn't taste very cheesy to me either. I would not order this again. . . Cornbread:. Warm, slightly sweet, and soft, this cornbread hit the spot. Great supplement to the salty chicken. . . Red koolaid:. This came in a large mason jar and was sweet, but not too sweet, making a refreshing quencher to the savory foods. . . Service:. The complimentary valet was nice, as there were a lot of cars and people around. Our waiter was friendly and prompt with taking our orders, despite the very full restaurant. . . Overall, I would like to come back and eat here again, but not on an empty stomach if it's busy.
This place is insane, great food, service was phenomenal (thanks Chris) and we need one in Seattle.
I came here for lunch and it was packed so there was a half an hour wait but I was craving the chicken so I patiently waited the 30 long grueling minutes. The wait staff was very nice about it and came out frequently to seat people. There were outdoor seating areas that were empty that they should convert to dining spaces.. When we were finally seated, the waitress was perky and ready to help. We ordered our Jar of Drank first. The koolaid was a bit warm with lots of ice and the lemonade had a crystal lite flavor to it. I ordered the 3 piece chicken with two waffles and eggs with cheese and onions and a side of grits. I do not like grits so I traded it for fries but they gave me rice instead... (must have been the loudness of the place). The chicken skin is so delicious and crisp with the perfect amount of salt. When you add their hot sauce the flavor is divine. The waffles have cinnamon and are nice and fluffy. I can't say much about the eggs and "fries" (rice) because they were pretty standard. I loved the foods they are known for but I would skip the extras. The price is not bad for the amount of food and the experience was nice.
I would highly suggest coming here, granted there are only a few locations. However, the price is right, and their sweet tea is sweet! I love their corn bread. The service is real good too, just be sure you come sooner than later because there's usually a wait.
So I finally got in this place. It was hard to find parking but trust me it's worth it. I waited 45 minutes to get a table. Once again worth the wait. Finally got seated. This place would have gotten five stars but unfortunately I got a server on her bad night I guess. Sharay was her name. I was there to eat and drink. I was open for anything. I asked what she recommended for a drink and she replied anything. Now I would have offered the most expensive drink they had. I was open for it. So I just ordered kool-aid. Which was the bomb. I once again asked what she suggested as far as the food goes. Once again anything was her reply. I don't even remember what I ordered but it was big portions. I eat a lot so I knew it was gonna take some effort. As soon as my food arrived not even five minutes later she was asking if I needed a check and a box. In my mind I was thinking I just got started. Now I was stuffed. I ate everything. Still had room for desert. But she didn't even offer so I was like well I better find another place to get some dessert. Even though I got crappy service I still tipped her 20% because I understand it's tough work. I look forward to going back and requesting Sharay again because everybody deserves a second chance.
Visited Lo Lo's for lunch last week and absolutely loved it. We don't have a soul food/southern spot near us so we definitely had high hopes for our stop here. The service was perfect, polite & quick. . Everything extra requested was responded with a "no problem" and a smile. I in no way was looking forward to the waffle, not knowing any better, but I was surprised about how good it was, especially with the fried chicken! Every trip here in the future I won't be passing them up. Our food was so good that we finished every last bite!. (Use the complimentary valet since parking in the neighborhood is practically impossible.)
LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I came on a Friday afternoon and got a table right away since it wasn't very busy. The service was quick and everyone was super friendly. I got the Lil Amadi with fries, and lemonade. Chicken was crispy and the WAFFLE was amazingly tasty. The menu made me giggle. Contemplated on coming back on my way to the airport but didn't have time :(.
I was so excited to eat here that I headed to Lo Lo's directly from the airport. I had 1 waffle with 2 thighs and I added cornbread and fried okra cuz they looked soooo good, but all of it was just average. That being said the food was hot and fresh and that's important to me, so I would eat here again but I'd try something different. The waitress was nice but it took 20 minutes to be seated and there were empty tables, I'm not sure why we had to wait, but eventually they decided to seat people. There was no toilet paper in any of the stalls which was frustrating and unsanitary. Kinda wish I had tried the Scottsdale location. . . Maybe my expectations were too high :/
This has to be the best fried chicken I have had since I had my grandfather's fried chicken growing up back in the hills of Kentucky. I couldn't go the waffle (just too much food) but the chicken was great as were the mac&cheese and the string beans with red potatoes. Paid extra to have a breast to take home the next day - it was even better the next day! And the bottle of beer served in a brown paper bag was a nice touch.. . The place is BUSY so plan for that. We were a large group and service was still very attentive and made sure we were pleased with everything. If you have to wait for a table, do it, it will be worth it. This is about an hours drive for me but I plan on making this at least a monthly date.
