Came in from California for the week and was interested in trying something new. I had the corned beef hash but was disappointed in there take on one of my favorite morning meals. The born beef was shredded and just mixed in with large chunks on potatoes and shredded cheese Very disappointing. The biscuit and grave was un impressive the biscuits were good but the gravy was poor. The coffee was good but all in all I will not be returning the Hash a go go. The name it self should have been a clue.
Great breakfast A+ service
Hash House is great. They serve large servings of farm inspired meals. We like taking out of town guests here b/c they always get a kick out of the industrial atmosphere and interesting menu choices. We used to eat here more before we evolved our diets to be more plant-based. There are only a few vegetarian options here and no vegan options (last we were there, which was probably over 2 years now). But... we would still recommend it. We've always been happy w/ the food. The service is just ok. We prefer more guinuine personalities and one waiter in particular seems like he's putting on a play. But sometimes you put up w/ that for some good food... sometimes you don't. Depends on the day.
I'm disappointed by a lot of breakfast joints, but this one was AMAZING.  If I could I would eat here everyday.  . . I ordered the Sage Chicken and Waffles, the portion was literally bigger than my head and was the best tasting chicken and waffles I've ever eaten.  Also, the waffles were stuffed with full sized strips of bacon.. . Disclaimer : Everything brought to the table was dressed with a sprig of sage, so maybe sage is just their thing, but it's delicious.
Way more Hype than quality and taste.
It's good and not very expensive but be prepared to wait and over eat. Do not eat the jelly, not good.
Great food! Love this place.
The food was good but the service at the front of the restaurant was terrible. I walked in with my friend and at least three people saw me and didn't greet us or get us seated. The girls just kept talking to each other and walking away from us. After 5-10 minutes of being ignored, a man asked if we've been helped noticing that I looked annoyed and I said no so he finally seated us. Mind you we were the only ones waiting to be seated and they weren't busy. After that the dining experience was fine and he waiter was nice,but I wouldn't go back. I can't stand when the service sucks! Especially when the girls were too busy talking and being rude. Do your job!
Great experience!  Food is exceptional, plentiful, and reasonable.  WARNING!!  Unless you are absolutely starving, share a meal.  We shared Chicken and Waffles and still couldn't finish it all.  The place is clean, the servers compentent, and the food is first class.  My only recommendation would be for the young lady who answered the phone when we called about a reservation... lighten up.  You were curt and cold.  We almost decided against going there because of you.
Great I'm not a carb guy too many hash browns otherwise luv everything about this place MUST Stop in if going to vegas
The biggest, best breakfast ever!
This place has great food. I took my two girls for breakfast on Mother's Day. We got there right when they opened, so we didn't have to wait long...but it was quite busy by the time we left. . . I ordered the chicken and asparagus hash. It was well seasoned and the potatoes and asparagus were perfectly tender. It comes with two eggs, made to order, a large biscuit and some fresh fruit. My oldest daughter ordered the grilled cheese, and my younger wanted the bacon waffles. Both were pleased, and I was happy that their prices were reasonable. No more than $5 for a kids meal (which were also generously portioned). . . A few things threw me off a little. First, I ordered my kids a bowl of fresh berries and whipped cream (it was an extra $1 to have the cream whipped...). There were two strawberries but mostly melon and orange slices. If I had known it was fruit and not berries, I probably wouldn't have ordered since I know my kids don't like cantaloupe. Also, I saw a bunch of fun looking drinks getting served to all of the tables around us. No one ever offered us a drink menu and I had no idea that they had so many fun drink options. It would have been nice to enjoy the juice I ended up ordering BEFORE my meal. I also wouldn't have wasted money on an iced tea (which wasn't great. I'm a bit of a tea snob though). So if you're not offered a drink menu, be sure to ask for one. The fresh kiwi watermelon lemonade was delicious! It came served with a big slice of watermelon on the glass. . . With the exception of my server, who wasn't rude but wasn't excited to be working, everyone was warm and pleasant. My girls had a good time tasting all of the fun food, and we will be back.
Pros: Awesome presentations, large portions and a unique concept.. . Cons: Service is usually sluggish and the presentation outperforms the taste of the dishes.
AMAZING place to try!! Large portions and reasonable prices!!! AND DELICIOUS!! I love myself some delicious brunch food and this place definitely serves it up!! Has delicious fatty brunch which is just what you need after a night of drinking!!
Been here multiple times, and they never fail to wow. Gorgeous cocktails, huge portions, tasty food, great service, and fun atmosphere. A bit of a drive off strip, but totally worth it. Try a BLT Bloody Mary!
Interesting menu items, well prepared
Great place to bring out of town guests. There is a lot to choose from and the portions are enormous. You may want to share with someone. Our waiter wasn't the most helpful...he told us the scramble we wanted was more of an omelet but didn't offer any recommendations. Our friends got pancakes with some sides and the hubs got some chicken dish. Everyone liked what they got. Would definitely go back.
Always liked this place in San Diego, good to see in LV.  The view is stunning (huge windows show-off the desert) and service is very friendly.  The food is the same so expect huge portions!  .  . Try to save room for the Bread Pudding!
Best breakfast place in Las Vegas.  The coffee gets this place the 5th star.  The food (especially the scrambles) are fantastic and priced very reasonably.  Best of all is the outstanding service, every server I have ever met here is knowledgable and customer focused.
I am surprised by all the accolades and 5 star ratings that this restaurant is getting. The Sushi chef is apparently from the strip from a top sushi restaurant (Social House?)... sounds impressive... yet I was not impressed. I was told that this can give Nobu a run for its money.... Fact: this restaurant's food does not come anywhere close to the quality and excellence of Nobu. . The food was okay... the sushi was good, the sashimi was just ok and in fact, the yellowtail sashimi was very disappointing. I did not eat much as I did not find it all that appetizing, and I love sushi and sashimi. . The ambiance is plain and boring, which would likely have been overlooked if the food was really good. . It was not bad, yet it was not great. I will not be going back. There are WAY better sushi restaurants off the strip in Vegas.
Hash house is always amazing... Try the Chicken and Waffles of the Meatloaf sandwich...
Amazing!!! Chorizo Hash is great.  Chorizo, jalapenos, red onion, cheddar cheese and tomato.  Very flavorful and the jalapenos add perfect heat.  The bacon waffles are also great.  Four strips of bacon mixed in a waffle.  Are you kidding me?  Great staff.  Great food.  Must try.
Brunch win! Others seem to know this too so expect a wait (ours was over an hour but it was Mother's Day).. . The food is very good and the offerings have some creativity which is awesome. Everyone mentions the portion sizes but not everything comes out as a serving for 3. But some things do...holy cow! That's cool though....split it or take if home for leftovers. Just please don't be the person that destroys a plate that will feed a small family (i.e. Chicken and Waffles). I witnessed this and it was gross. . . I'd recommend the Sage Fried Chicken - it comes with a biscuit, some eggs, and a bunch of bacon mashed potatoes, which were rather unremarkable actually. But remember...doggy bags, people!
Overrated. . . My boyfriend and I were so excited to go here because of the great reviews they had. Sorry to say that I do not feel like the reviews lived up to my expectations.. . The line was extremely long and we waited a good 20 minutes for a table. Not a problem at all. We weren't in any rush. We were seated and the waiter came about 5 minutes after which was also fine. It gave us time to look over the menu which I wasn't impressed with. The menu was large, didn't offer anything to me that appealed to me. I ordered a vegetarian option since everything had with meat included pork which I do not eat. I must say, it would be nice to have turkey sausage or turkey bacon on the menu for those of us who doesn't eat pork. However, having a vegetarian breakfast wasn't a problem. . . I order an egg scrambled with veggies and cheese added. It came with fresh fruit, potatoes and a humongous biscuit. This biscuit was bigger than my palm! Sadly, that was the highlight of the meal. The potatoes had no flavor and were kinda cold. You can tell that they were cooked in large quantity earlier in the day and served out of pot. The fruit was sweet so I didn't have any issue. My eggs and veggies again lacked flavor. I had to add a nice amount of salt and pepper to give it some kinda "umph". The food was just OK. . . I was very disappointed with the food considering all of the hype including chefs like Rachel Ray. I have experienced MUCH better brunch/breakfast food.
This place is good but the portions are way too big it just turns me off I like my breakfast simple and delicious not over the top.  Good food just way too big portions
This place was amazing.  Came to the Rio for the weekend and arrived early enough for breakfast.  Was directed to the Hash House a Go Go and thought, crap here is a glitzy place with a a name for enticing people...i was gladly disappointed.  Got the cravy and bisquits with scrambled egges.  The price was about 15 which is decent for breakfast in vegas.  The only negative about the meal is that i was not abl eto take it to go being that i had not yet checked in.. . the only down side is the service was very suspect.  but you are so involved in eat this huge plates of food, that you just seem to nto realize you are out of coffee until...
A Must place to eat if you are in Vegas. Great staff; very friendly, very good customer service. The food comes out fast and tastes great! Huge portions for a good price- would recommend it to anyone.
Went here with my friends and I do think that the place was overrated. The food does look good but the taste is a different story. Everything here was massive so I got a tad bit intimidated with the food. I decided to order the Crispy Cornmeal Salmon Sandwich (the healthiest food I can find in the menu) and was quite disappointed with it. The texture was weird. I felt like I was eating tiny rocks with my fish. It was just bad. I also tried my friend's meal which was the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower (most popular one!) and nothing too special about it. Overall, I wasn't satisfied with the meal. I think they should make the food a little bit smaller. It was just too excessive IMO...
amazingly delicious! awesome every time!
We had brunch here a couple weeks ago and let me tell you this place was AMAZING! I had the sage chicken and waffles. The plate was huge. It also came with fried leeks which I had never tasted before but became an instant fan. The dish was a nice twist on a southern classic. My husband had the blackberry pancakes with a side of biscuits and gravy (we are serious about our biscuits and gravy). Everything was delicious. The service was quick and very friendly. I recommend this place to everyone because of their diverse menu and wonderful service.
We had high expectations when we got there as we had never been before. We were seated within a few minutes with no wait. The service was fine and real complaints there. I ordered a mashed potato burger with bacon and my wife had the vegetable soup. Her soup was served in a very small bowl that looked about the size of a small measuring cup. It was packed with mushrooms and no visable other vegetables. She didn't enjoy it and didn't finish it. I had the double meat mashed potato burger with bacon. The bun was huge and looked great but was too hard to even bite into. I had to take the meat off the bun and use a fork. The meat and potatoes worked week and tasted good but all in all I was let down because when you want a burger u want the whole thing and not without the bun. It was over priced and over hyped.
So I checked this place out last weekend.  It was mad packed with a waitlist and all.  The atmosphere was very boisterous with a full bar , people gathered both inside and outside the door waiting to be seated, as waiters/waitresses zipped through serving patrons.. . My wait wasn't that long considering how busy the restaurant was.  I was seated in the bar area at one of the "high-tops".  It was fine because I had a great view of the bar, the patio and the front door area.  There wasn't really anything special to see but I still enjoy people watching.. . Ok, so I had to order the chicken and waffles everyone raves about.  Must I say, it truly did deliver.  I have to admit that I was a bit awe-struck on just how I was going to attack the towering monstrosity that lay before me.  Needless to say, I had to request a to-go after on eating about 1/3 of my breakfast.  . . Specifics:  . The crunch on the chicken was to die for.  The waffles were very good and I think they would be good with or without being laced with strips of bacon.  The dish comes with a drizzle of syrup which was not enough for me so I requested a side of syrup.. . Service was quick and efficient.  Like when asked for a clean fork instead of the one with left over stuck on food that was waiting at the table for me as I sat down.    My order came out way too fast which is always  an eyebrow lifter.  I mean just long was my food sitting under a warming light before it was plated?. . Overall, I enjoyed the restaurant and the food (good atmosphere, good food).  I would like to visit again when it is not so busy.
Nom. Nom. Nom.  Great service, awesome food.
The plates are huge and their food is delicious!! its a casual place, would go back soon.
Hash House is amazing! Great food and always great service. I've been here with groups ranging from just my husband and myself to 20 people and never had a bad experience.
I enjoy this place, the food is always good. Very crowded on a weekend so get there early. The portions are huge, only drawback, but you can share.
I've gone to two locations. The food is good with nice size portions for the price. Always busy so it's a little noisy and a lot going on. The only thing that is horrible is the wait time. If you're really really hungry you might want to rethink it because you'll be waiting at least 20 mins.
This is one of those restaurants that is truly an original. Their dishes are unique, delicious and visually awesome. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, there are many options that make this establishment worth a special trip. Come hungry! Portions are generous.
Just because a portion is large, doesn't mean it's exceptionally good. The food was alright, but this seems to be more of a novelty place. It can get pretty packed with people who saw it on TV, so a wait is something to consider. . . It's fun to check out once, but I would rather have a normal portion of a really good dish, than a giant portion of something that's more around a B- or B.
This place is insane! Gut buster status. Great comfort food that is over the top. Not diet food. Bbblt has like 9 pieces of bacon. Bacon bloody marys. Bacon waffles. My goodness. Huge portions.
Biggest portions of mouth watering food that is not only flavorful but filling also.. Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's are to die for.
This is one of th ebest places in town, big meals! Food is really good. Thank goodness they have a location San Diego!
AHHHHHHMAZING!!! the portions are HUGE & prices a bit steep, but the food is delicious!!!  We shared the tower o' chicken and waffles, the crab cakes and a pot roast hash.  Everything was to die for.  We also had a round of mimosas that were put in a to go cup so we could enjoy them on the walk back to our hotel - gotta love Vegas! . . Definitely make this a must stop on your next trip, you won't be disappointed!
Everything is huge here! the plates and food is overloaded and I really like it. It's like back home food with a kick and turned up a couple notches. I got the chicken and waffles which was delicious.
My wife and I ate there on 5/28/14 at 745 pm .I had a stuffed blue cheese burger ,I have owned a meat packing for 35 years.in my opinion it was the worst hamburger I have in a very long time .we use to eat there every other week never again. My wife had chicken benedict the chicken was like jerky .Sad to see it go down hill.
This place is awesome. Probably the best prices in Las Vegas for what you get. Everything is monstrous, share! We shared two things, the bread pudding and a salmon hashbrown, bad combo on our part.
Breakfast was great, service was fast and friendly, only problem I had is there really wasn't a health option but I can't wait to go back on my next cheat day!
been to 2 of 3 vegas locations. totally delicious. the eggs are so fresh. i never thought i'd be able to tell the difference between grocery store fresh and farm fresh but there's a HUGE difference. good size portions.
I heard a lot about this place and unfortunately, I didn't try this place out until a lot later on. As long as you end up doing it, it's never too late in my eyes.. . There are a few locations around Vegas, and even one that recently opened up in the Rio if that's closer to you. I heard a lot about this place and their portion sizes, that's what everyone always raves about, and that got me interested. When I got there with my family, I could just see the large plates they served their food on. Their food was looking really intimidating before I actually sat down with my food, but I quickly learned it wasn't so bad.. . The menu isn't too complicated at all, they have a decent selection of food that can fit the taste of many different people. If you aren't a big eater, I would recommend sharing with someone else, but if you have a big appetite, you should be ok with finishing one dish by yourself.
