This place is huge, as every place in Las Vegas is, but it did the trick for a single night in town before we headed out to the Grand Canyon. Conveniently on the train line, so easy to get to the strip, but nice to get a little away from it at the end of the day. Room was clean and fine. No more or less smoky or crowded than any other place in Vegas. Check in and checkout were quick and easy. My husband and kids enjoyed the pool, though it was really, really crowded. Only warning is not to waste your money at the "diner" restaurant in the hotel - WAY overpriced.
$14 for internet after $20 resort fee per day.  Happy hour at pool was fun, 4 to 8.  Loved the shows, rock revival and mo5iac.  Some employees complete assholes.  Got hosed on crystal-light tasting Margaritas at vince Neils place.  Dirty shower, white grout was black. They recommended a cab service, we used them, and were charged $45 for a ride from airport.  Cabby named Soliman, avoid this dick wad. Quite frankly all of Vegas seemed like a rip off.  Probably not going back.
Just returned from a long Vegas weekend.  This place was AWESOME!  I was honestly worried after reading the reviews, but this place ROCKED in every aspect of accommodations that affected me.  . . Check-in was smooth and they accommodated my early arrival.  There were 20 or 21 check-ins ahead of me and it took exactly 22 minutes for me to reach the counter.  I stayed in the East Tower on the 10th floor.  AWESOME ROOM.  Furniture still smelled new, carpet was new, view was incredible.  Bathroom remodel was rather plush, with nice furniture grade fixture and marble floors and shower walls.  Hot water instantly, great drainage, and plush towels.  Nice shampoo, and conditioner, and lotion.  Nice soaps, too.  Closet had real hangers.  Nice 37" flat screen and a little refrigerator.  Staff everywhere was ridiculously cool-  Randy at check-in, housekeeping (sorry, I forgot your name!) and the various restaurants.  Everyone was way, way nice.  . . Yes, there is a $20/day resort fee that sucks.  You do get in-room WiFi for a single device.  I couldn't log into it-  seemed overwhelmed with users when I tried using it.. . If you are a sports bettor, the Superbook is AWESOME!  Whole staff there was fantastic!  Even the drink service was plentiful.  (Judging from my waking condition, one might say too plentiful...)  . . Don't be too skeptical-  They've emerged from their BK period and pumped a lot of cash into the place.  I recommend finding the many discounters and giving this place a try.  Priceline has decent deals there, as do, I'm sure, all the others.  Monorail is right there.  Use the multi-ride discount if you need to get to the strip a few times.  Note the cab ride in traffic cost me $27.50 from the airport but only $18.50 returning.  Their deli closes intermittently.  This place is four Yelp stars.  Give it a shot!
While the location of this hotel is great, the beds are incredibly uncomfortable, my bathroom had hair in it from a previous guest, the tv reception appears as if it's coming through an antenna, their banquet servers for a conference I'm attending are incredibly rude, and my laptop has acquired a virus through the wifi connection. I'll return to Vegas, but will never stay here again! . . Thank goodness the other casinos are close by, as the one here is depressing and outdated. Take your hard earned money andspend it elsewhere.
I stayed here for a conference recently. The conference rooms were decent, but the hotel room was a disappointment for me. The rooms are dated and not worth roughly the $100 per nightI was charged. I would not stay here again. Thanks, but no thanks.
Great hotel and casino.. Hotel rooms are mediocre, beds are very comfortable, room service is great!. Hotel bathrooms are not very nice and dark.. Resort amenities are a 6 out of 10, and your options are limited.. . Casino: I would say its nice, but the atmosphere can be improved by some live plants on the casino floor,since everything is so artificial.. . Prices are great for what you get, and for that reason I would recommend LVH to others.
This hotel and casino is great and good priced. The monorail goes along the hotel and is we'll worth the day.
I have been to the LVH several times and the last time I was there, last week, I was sitting at a game and a guy comes up to me and asks for a cigarette.  I say no and he gets in my face.  I hit the service button on the machine and again tell him I'm not giving him a cigarette.  He stands there and stairs me down.  By this time I'm pretty sure he's gonna hit me or perhaps pull a knife, but finally he walks away.  Five minutes later an attendant finally comes and asks, "What's the problem?".  It tell them my story and apparently they know about "this guy".   Deviant crackheads are everywhere because the "hood" is just down the street.  I know this isn't exactly LVH's fault though.  . . The gaming is difficult at best, the drinks are overpriced and seem to go up and down in price, depending on which bar/bartender you visit.  I've been charged $4 up to $7.50.  What is the real price here?!?!?  . . The only thing positive I can tell you is that the buffet is great, the sports book is really nice and a great place to make your bet.
Loved it. Nice location OFF THE STRIP, but real close. Catch the Monorail to the strip. Pool area was fun. Went to "Old School" by the pool enjoyed live R&B Music, as well as a DJ spinning classic R&B. Room was wonderful. I think people who give this hotel a bad rating are part of the 1%. If you are expecting billionaire service on a Hundredaire budget, then  all I can do is laugh at you.
worst place I have ever stayed.  What a dive. Food on the floor when I checked in. Asked to have it cleaned but to no effect. It is like daylight in the room at night. Black outs where removed and the remaining are worthless  The bed is hard as a rock with a worn out lumpy torn mattress pad. Desk chair is broken cannot lean back or will flip you.  Needs a major overhaul.
Stayed here simply because we got a deal that we could not pass up. The hotel itself is ok for the pricing. You get your standard nice size room and you may have a view depending on the side you are on. There are a couple of food places that stay open all night in the hotel. The hotel is a tad bit on the older. Its about two miles from the strip but there's a monorail that will take you there. All in all i can say not to bad.
Two and a half stars and going down, I suppose. Lets start from the beginning. The check-in was user unfriendly, and the staff seemed oblivious that a line was forming and seemed more interested in conversing with each other than help the guests check in.. The hallway smelled old rather a Las Vegas hotel even if it isn't one of the more pricey hotels.. The room smelled the same. On first tour of the room, one thing stood out even when compared to the Motel 6's and Super 8's across the country. The charged you for the coffee. $2 a cup. I almost thought they were offering complimentary bottled water, but nope... it stated that it would charged to your room if you opened it. I started to pull back the sheets when I noticed that you'd be charged extra if you used the bed. No, just kidding, but I am serious about the coffee and water. Strange. . The water pressure was almost nil. The TV was missing ANY paid cable station (HBO, Showtime, etc). . The only thing that I DID like was the view as we were on the 20th floor, and the morning view was awesome. I'm looking forward to moving on!
Recently stayed at LVH for Baker to Vegas weekend.  I was very disappointed to learn they charge $3/day for the use of the safe and rooms were adaquate at best.  There was even wall paper coming off of the wall in the bathroom.. . Upon arriving home I learned that LVH FROZE my account for the entire amount of my room TWICE plus incidentals.  Upon calling them, they did not fix the problem and stated it may take up to 5 business days to get my money back that they locked up.. . Don't think I will be staying here again.
LVH....DO NOT STAY here!!! Very poor customer front desk service. Took us an hour and a half to check in. They overbook people and make promises they can't keep. Why note remarks in your computer if you can't honor them....Very poor business. They told me I would get a double bed, adjoining room with my sister. They gave up that room and then said they would put us on the same floor at least. They gave that one up too and then they put us in the "parlor room". Basically made it seem all fancy but when we get there all they have in the room is a Murphy bed, a 2 person love seat.  I requested a Rollaway bed for my kids and they said it may take 4 hours...it's 3am now and nothing. The couch doesn't even pull out. TV reception is fuzzy for all stations. My son had to sleep in two chairs put together because they overbooked and gave up my reserved room. The manager then noted in my file that I would get a new room the next morning. She even gave me a new room number...I called 2 times for my new room and they gave that specific room up too. I spoke to the day manager on the next day who was able to rectify the situation needless to say, I wasn't going down without a fight for fairness. She offered mea new room that still needed to be cleaned and couldn't give me a time when it would be ready. It turned out to be the handicapped room with a wheelchair accessible shower that made the bathroom floor wet the whole entire time of our stay.  So...I repeat... Save yourself the hassle....DO NOT STAY AT LVH!!! WORST hotel EVER!!!
So I stayed here because the event I was attending was here and they offered a great price for Memorial Day weekend.  That is where the good stuff ended.  We waited close to an hour to check in...at 1am!  Then to help us feel better about that we got an "upgraded" room.  Got to the room and there was a dressed up Murphy bed that folded into the wall.  To be fair it was comfortable...however if that was an upgrade, I really do not want to see the regular rooms.  Next the Internet was $14 per 24hrs.  When we went to use the safe it wasn't working.  To their credit they did say it would take 30 min for someone to come look and it only took 10 and he fixed it within five minutes.  Just felt like if the room price wasn't so great on a holiday weekend I would have been extremely upset.  Know you are not getting super customer service...just getting basic stuff without the class even if they try to say it is classy.
What an iconic property, The casino looks so classy. It seems the owners of this place do not realize its potential. No money has been pumped into making this a better place. The Casino is large, the buffet is good but pricey, and it has the biggest sportsbook in the city (if you like sports--i dont). . The Rooms are better than averageand although some rooms received upgrades, some other areas of the property could use a refresh too.. . The LVH is connected by monorail to the rest of town so transportation is no worries here. You can expect a good room and good stay
As a prerequisite to my review, I would like to add that I did not use the casino, bars, pool, or shops. I was here for my siblings' basketball tournament over Memorial Day weekend, and it was my first time in Vegas. . . The rooms were nothing special. The beds were pretty comfortable, the TV offered a few channels (though some were pretty fuzzy), and the room was spacious enough for the 4 of us. However, I seriously disliked the bathroom. It was extremely outdated with pink tiled floors, a toilet seat stained yellow, and a shower head that was much too small to accommodate to my 5'8 frame. Unless you are 5'5 or smaller, you would have been too tall to take a comfortable shower. Our water pressure seemed to spit out like bullets, but my parents claimed their shower next door barely trickled the water out. I'd like to add that as a woman, I was slightly irked that there wasn't a trash can in the bathroom. Who wants to carry a used genome product outside the bathroom to a trash can in the sink area? The room offered keurig coffee for $3.50 a pop, $4 water that I got for a dollar across the street, and wifi for about $15 a day. Completely ridiculous. . . One of the worst parts about the hotel are the elevators. We would have to press the button two or three times because the elevators were always full. If you want to make 12:00 check out, go early! It's a madhouse. . . I'm not too familiar with Vegas, but if you come for an experience, I would pass on LVH.
I was at the LVH for a family wedding May 23-26, 2014.. . 1.  Hotel Rooms.  Hotel room was very nice.  Mostly all new carpet, fabrics, etc. Very clean, very nice.  Comfortable bed.  My whole family had rooms there so I got to see various rooms and they were all equally nice.  . 2.  Hotel check-in.  Ouch! There was a terrible line for check-in -- probably 150 people -- but they handled it quickly.  This was probably to be expected on the Friday of the Memorial day weekend.  All the staff was polite and helpful.  We had ordered a wheelchair for my elderly father and they had it ready to go.  LVH is run well, from what I experienced.. 3.  Property.  This hotel was formerly the Las Vegas Hilton.  It was one of the very best hotels back in the day.  Now there are dozens of fancy, themed hotels, so this hotel is showing its age.  It's just not exciting like the others.  The guest rooms were recently refurbished and quite nice but the building in general is showing its age.  It's still nice but just not at the very grand scale of the new places.  Elevators were a challenge -- sometimes a 5 min wait during peak times.. 4.  Pool area.  Great!. 5.  Cost.  Very low.  $79/night.. 5.  Location.  Location is off the strip but there's a monorail to take you there.
This was the worst ever to stay for Memorial Day Weekend. Did not know that they would be lots of kids staying due to the Baskeball & Valley Ball Touranmant! UGH!  I reserved a double bed room 1 1/2 in advance. Stood in line over 30 mins to get a dirty room with 1 king side bed, that was all they had left. WTF! Shouldnt I havent gotten what I paid for? . Went into the room, plopped on the bed, we were so tired considering we just drove 4 hours. As the day went on we notice the tub was dirty with hair it the tub. And the tub facuet would not stop running, we had to close the bathroom door. Gross. Left the room to go to the pool. Came back and heard a piecring noise. Me and my sister couldnt figure out where it was coming from. I picked up the alarm clock, messed with it for 2 mins trying to turn it off. Here is the kicker it was UNPLUGGED! I opened the door and placed hte damn alarm clcok on the floor. An employee was walking by so I ended up giving him the alarm clock. Of course there was no way in hell we could of gotten another room due to it being sold out! The next day, Sunday found an eyelash on the ground and gum under the bed. Ice machine was not working on our floor, we had to go up one level to get ice. The ac/heater is noisy!. . Nice shops. Buffet alright. Coffee tea place decent. NIce employees. Good drinks at the pool 4pm-7pm, 2 for 1 drinks. . Never again will I stay here. Unless Im accomodated really well!
I"m pretty disappointed in Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. I definately don't remember   Las Vegas Hilton, previously named, being this unattentive and responsive to one of their guests. I decided to write their customer relations dept, who it seemed to be emailed to a "TPIXLER but still have not received any type of acknowledgement of receipt. Won't ever be staying here again....no matter how desperate I get that for sure. . . Here is what I emailed on 05/05/14 if you guys want to read. . . LVH consumer relations,. I stayed  at your hotel on 05/XX-05/XX, this last weekend visiting Las Vegas. I used to stay at your hotel alot in the previous years in which I had great memories all around. I'm glad to see that it is still the same as when it used to be Hilton but with new rennovated sections, but also some servicing concerns. I am a long time patron of your hotel even if it was during the Hilton days. I am writing you today to address an issue directly instead of "yelp"ing it or "trip advisor"ing like everyone else does because I would really like to stay here again. . Upon my arrival, your hotel's check-in was easy and gentlemen who helped me was very pleasant. He gave us a regular size smoking room near the elevator on the 12th floor. When arriving into our hotel room, it was as I remembered it with some upgrades such as the Keurig coffee maker...very nice. The bathroom seems to be decent but noticed some things that seemed to be not up to "LVH" standards i'm sure.  When taking a bath, there were two different porcelain soap holders, lower near the tub and higher up the wall about eye level. The higher up one had crusty dirt and grime that could be caked on from possible old soap residue covering about 1/3 of the holder along with a string of long hair. The lower soap holder was clean. Since i wasn't sure what that residue exactly was it was unpleasant to try to avoid my hair/body parts from touching that area while showering. It's not normal to get dirty when trying to get clean right?  . Another concern was the shower head and surrounding area. The covering/drywall area around the shower head was cracked and unprofessional looking. It devalues the entire room..almost like it's just a motel and not the vintage hotel as I know it as. The water pressure of the shower head was very low. Not to sound so negative but if I could fit into the sink, that would've been a more efficient shower honestly.. So those are my concerns from my stay. I hope you can forward my issues to someone who could help this situation and utilize them to better your hotel for your guests..possibly the hotel maintance manager and the specific maid of that room and floor who prepared the room for me. . Thank you for your time.
