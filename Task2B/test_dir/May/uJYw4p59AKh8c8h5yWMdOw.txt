I'm NEVER staying at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino again... I left this morning FIVE HOURS ago and realized I left my favorite dress (that I bought in Australia) was in the closet. I called and I get a "There's no log of a lost item from that room number." So I call back and I get a "check with lost and found" and I get nothing. Then I call the front desk again and at this point I'm crying because there's no f*cking reason they shouldn't have my dress!!!! You are REQUIRED to hold on to it and TRY to get it back to its RIGHTFUL owner. So then I am on hold because the front desk guy who I call said he'll try to find someone who can help me, and eventually the phone reroutes to someone else. She gets me in contact with security so I'm filing a stolen item report. Truth is, the dress isn't worth much in cash but I got it 8000 miles away and I'll never be able to replace it. I'm supposed to go back to this hotel on May 30th for another concert, but knowing they have staff who steals from people? Screw that. It's the principle of it. What if it was a diamond ring or something of more value? You guys are THIEVES and you have shitty people working for you and I'm NOT going back to this hotel. Ever.
Pros: Great location, attached to the miracle mile shopping center and it houses Britney until 2015! The staff is nice and the casino isn't bad. There is a decent 21+ pool. . . Cons: Slowest elevators ever. They charge $25 to use the gym. Keys deactivate pretty easily. Terrible taxi line. . . Not bad for the price but if you want nicer amenities, look elsewhere!
One of the worst hotels I have ever stated at. Dirty, terrible pool, NO WIFI. I would never stay here again and I would recommend that no one stays here.
I wouldn't stay at Planet Hollywood again. From the moment me and my three girlfriends arrived I was annoyed. They charged us $16 to check in early, which I've never heard of a hotel doing if they have a room available. Then, when we got to our room it reeked of weed. I called the front desk to complain (it took about 15 minutes to even get through) and they said they couldn't give us another room, but could send someone up to spray it. Well, that never happened. The room smelled like weed all weekend because the room next to us was blowing it into our bathroom vent. We called again to complain Friday night that it was an issue, so the hotel comped our $16 early check in fee (something I feel we shouldn't have been charged in the first place) and sent Security up to look into it. Nevertheless, every night weed blew into our vents and smelled up our room. Planet Hollywood's inability to remedy the situation left a bad taste in my mouth. On top of that, the rooms are really so-so, almost outdated even. I was surprised that they didn't have iPod docks as most hotels do these days. Another thing that was super annoying was how bad the water pressure was in the shower, it was so light that my showers weren't even pleasant. All the water pressure went to the sink faucet instead, causing water to splash everywhere every time you turned it on.  I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Vegas over the past 14 years (Wynn, MGM, Paris, Hard Rock) and this is by far the worst room I've stayed in. There are better hotels for the same price or less. All Planet Hollywood has going for it is a great location on the strip.
This place was over priced given it's age, lack of updating. Everything was worn, slightly dirty/worn/torn state. However, since the majority of the crowd was 20-30years old and just drunk or looking for a hookup, I don't think the average customer minded. The upholstery in the lounge was torn, the elevators dirty, the furniture in the rooms missing doors and peeling off etc. you can do much better for the price range. The buffet was ok, even though our waiter was overly friendly In a creeper kind of way. We were here for a convention but should have moved to another hotel after the conference. My friend had a suite and there was no bathroom door to the shower area...only the toilet room had a door. Besides the privacy issue, the bathroom window flooded the bedroom area with lights from the strip. It had an awesome view, but made it difficult to sleep well she said. Our garage roof view at least meant the room was dark at night. We were across from the elevator, which meant we were awaken many times each night by happy, very drunk people about to get lucky. Will not stay here again.
I wouldn't stay at Planet Hollywood again nor would I recommend anyone to stay there. From the second we arrived to the hotel, service was slow. We waited for valet and for a bellboy to come get our belongings. When I got to the front desk to check in the lady told me they didn't have anymore 2 queen size beds available but had a king size available, (yea with four girls, sure), I paid for TWO QUEENS !! The lady finally found one and, after she did they had the nerve to charge us $16 to check in early, which I've never heard of a hotel doing if they have a room available. I've stayed at 5 star hotels and NEVER been charged for an "early check in." . As soon as my friends and I walked into our room it reeked of weed. We called the front desk to complain (it took about 15 minutes to even get through) and they said they couldn't give us another room, (which they could've because the lady at the first desk asked us if we wanted to upgrade) they also said they would send someone up to spray. Well, that never happened! The room smelled like weed all weekend because the room next to us was blowing it into our bathroom vent. We called again to complain Friday night that it was an issue, so the hotel comped our $16 early check in fee (something I feel we shouldn't have been charged in the first place) and sent Security up to look into it. Nevertheless, everynight weed blew into our vents and smelled up our room. . Planet Hollywood's inability to remedy the situation left a bad taste in my mouth. On top of that, the rooms are really small, almost outdated even. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Vegas over the years, from 5 stars to 3 stars and this is by far the worst room I've stayed in. The only thing PH has going for them is Britney Spears!! The star is for Britney Spears.
First time in Vegas and I stayed here. Decent room loved the set up of the gambling floor. Awesome restaurants and friendly staff. I would come here again.
Even though I have never stayed at Planet Hollywood, I absolutely love this casino. This is my favorite place to gamble. I also love that they have a Fat Tuesday around. Oh and they now have the QUEEN of POP Britney doing her own show. This place is WINNING!
My Wife and I spent 4 days, 3 nights... Room was nice and quiet. Casino was average. The staff, for the most part was courteous, with the exception of the Helpdesk attendant who was rude when we needed help connecting to WiFi. . . I would rather spend my time and money at the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay, the are MUCH nicer.. . Won't be back.. It's no worth it.
Booked a night at Planet Hollywood to watch Britney's Piece of me with my best friend.. . Paid $180 and change plus tax. And $20. Something for resort fee( which we did not use anything in the resort) . . $200+ for one night of stay only to find out they have put us into the corner of the corner of their hotel. The sidekick room of the suite!! And on top of that  the water pressure for the shower felt like I was showering in a 3rd world country... . . My suggestion for everyone is this. If you don't have to stay here. Book else where. Totally not worth the $$$
This was our home away from home while we were in Vegas. We came for the Britney Spears show, and it was really nice to be able to walk down and then come back without having to drive or take a taxi. . . I got a suite upgrade upon check-in. We were there for a sort of whirlwind weekend, and so spent an entire day here in the resort without ever having to leave. There are so many stores and restaurants that you can walk around forever and never see daylight. The rooms were relatively comfortable, and we enjoyed the upgrade on the suite we got. . . This wouldn't be the first place I thought of as romantic, but we went with a group of friends, and part of this weekend was to celebrate that I got engaged. The rest was my friends' birthdays. I did tell them I was there for a romantic weekend, so I imagine that's why I got the big sexy tub and the Showgirls themed decor. It was fun and ridiculous. I do have a couple of complaints. Obviously, this being Vegas, there is debauchery happening at all hours in the hall, and you are going to hear that. People running down the halls and yelling at each other isn't unusual. We might have contributed to that noise with our pre-going out, getting ready parties, so I can't hate on that too much. But that brings me to my next point. It's fairly common for hotels to have some kind of speakers where you can hook up a phone or laptop to listen to music. Planet Hollywood only has a basic clock radio with no AV hookups. We also couldn't hook anything up to the TV. That would be a really basic upgrade that would infinitely add to the comfort of the rooms.  . . We were required to pay a "resort fee" for $22 a day that includes one device per day internet and two gym passes. We did not use the gym, and would've preferred to pay the $13 (still steep) for internet instead, but we were told it was mandatory. The cell service for both Verizon and AT&T were really awful in all of our rooms, and the conspiracy theorist in me feels like they throttle it some way so that you'll buy the internet. I had a really difficult time accessing data or getting texts in the hotel, and then once we hit the Casino and Miracle Mile, it was at full strength. . . On Sunday, the pool had a DJ spinning, and there was fun in the air. But it was also really loud. Like difficult to hear each other talking even though we were on the other side of the pool. Most people didn't seem to have a problem, because people were mostly just sunbathing. The service was good, and the servers came by several times to check on us. . . It was definite Vegas experience, and we enjoyed every boozy minute of our celebratory weekend. It's not the classiest place, but if you're looking for an easy, very stereotypically Vegas experience, this one is convenient and right in the middle of the action.
Stayed here for 3 nights due to a free room offer received in the mail. The room was just standard, Nothing special, and there was a broken lamp. Also the TV was messing up. As far asthe casino itself, it clearly caters to the 30 and under party crowd. The one highlight for me was the Miracle Mile shops. So three stars for that alone. Overall I don't see myself staying here again.
I had the worst experience staying in this hotel. . . First, upon arrival, in the checkin in valet area, nobody even bothered to help us. We had so much luggage and i have to get the bellman for help, they were too late, my poor hubby already got our heavy luggages on his own. . . 2. Front desk- the person who checked us in doesnt seem friendly and accommodating. He placed us in a "non-smoking room" but unfortunately the room smells like smoke. . 3. We are going up to our room and reached the 15th floor. We could smell cigarette smoke everywhere. Upon arrival to the room, the room smelled like a mixture of cleaning product and cigarette smoke. I was upset because all we thought is they are putting us in a non smoking room. I complained and asked to be moved. The front desk said theres no available non smoking room that they can offer. . . I was fuming mad because i cant stand inhaling the cigarette smoke in the room so I went down to talk to the supervisor. The supervisor did not even seem apologetic and instead became defensive saying. Those rooms are non smoking room. But people can smoke in the hallway. We saw cigarette butts in the carpet and 2 ashtrays close to the elevator. . . I complained about the A/C vent smells like cigarette smoke as well and they said they cannot do anything about it. . . I wanted to get a refund and leave. I cannot stand staying in this hotel with such bad service and rooms that smell like cigarette smoke! (Non smoking they said) with all the commotions of going back and forth and getting too upset i had bleeding so i have no choice but to calm down and stay there for a night and decided to leave the next day. . . What we found out is several customers also complained about the same issue. The hotel management was NOT apologetic and said different reasons such as vent issues etc. . . I finally get to talk to their manager named Roberto and accused my dad of videotaping him. He is so paranoid. My dad is not even on the video and just browsing over the pictures we got from the room that we are complaining about. He seemed very defensive and again NOT APOLOGETIC! . . 4. Housekeeping- it took 1 hour to get our request for extra towels. We called 3-4 times! Such a slow service.. . I am warning all of you. This place sucks! They give the worst service, worst experience... All they will give you is problems. . . If you want to have a better experience go to Aria! Or any other hotels than this hotel. It will just give you problems. Never book in this hotel!!!'
DISCLAIMER:  This review is for the POOL only.  I did NOT stay at the hotel or anything else.  I just visited the pool here.  That being said...... . I was out drinking til about 10a.m. the night before.  My friends and I woke up around 3pm to chill out at the pool.  I felt like death.  All I wanted was a nice pool to lay out at and a sweet cabana to chill in.  Luckily, even though we arrived late to our cabana reservation, they gave everyone the cabanas for free.  I thought, WOW what a start to the day.  THen I enter the seating area and notice it looks extremely dead and not nearly as nice as lets say Marquee's pool.  THEN, I go to sit down on the cabana couch and I instantly get a Charlie horse in my butt.  The cabana couch was so outdated, crusty and old and not to mention had NOOOO cushioning to it.  It was like sitting on concrete.  I tried to convince my friends to leave and pay for a real cabana but they weren't down to move so we took a slightly more comfortable seat on a chaise type couch in the sun.  They need to seriously renovate their pool cuz compared to the rest it is god awful!!!
The hotel was very nice. They checked us in quickly & was very nice at the front desk. We requested a fridge and got one right away. Would have been nice if there was a coffee maker & a microwave in the room. Anyway, the casino was ok. It was clean & not to smokey. While there, we ate at Earl of Sandwich several times because it was quick and cheap and good. There was one girl there that had a bit of attitude, but it was my last night there, so I didn't care. . We stayed there because we were going to see Britney!  We got upgraded to the front of the stage!  Thank you for that cause it was awesome!!  I would stay there again.
I love Planet Hollywood! I stayed here my first Vegas trip and had a great experience. I didn't have any problems with the costoner service and the staff were accommodating and great! The location of Planet Hollywood can't be beat because you're centrally located right in the middle of the strip so you can practically walk to any place on the strip. I like the feel of Planet Hollywood a lot- the decor is nice and our room was spacious and great! The Miracle Mile shops has got some nice stores as well! Planet Hollywood also has some nice places to eat- like the eateries in Miracle Mile and their buffet. Their buffet was great! Another plus is that you can watch the Bellagio fountain show from the hotel- I sure did! I got a good view of the fountain and you could hear the music too! Overall, I think Planet Hollywood is a great hotel and would recommend it to anyone because it's very affordable too!
Well, another hotel in Vegas down. Will I return? No. . . The rates were totally inflated and I'm sure that there was probably an event there this past weekend as well as a Canadian holiday however, totally not worth it. We were there for 4 nights. . . Blaring Britney Spears was enough to kill me - all weekend long in all the common areas. . . We went to 2 restaurants, 1 club and the gym here - as well as the Starbucks. Underwhelmed is all I have to say. . . And lets not forget the pool - full of garbage, murky as a milkshake and generally lacking any cleanliness on the entire rooftop scenario. Garbage, human hair and fluids everywhere - disgusting. The pool actually glowed ORANGE at night it was so dirty. Like another reviewer said - feels like you're in a parking lot. . . The gym was in the spa area and only open until 7pm. Equipment was old and looked like something my grandpa would've built in his own basement - the photos online are NOT what their gym actually looks like, do not be fooled. . . At Koi nightclub we got bottle service and had the equivalent of rocket fuel served to us - we were both very sick from the poor quality vodka - I can't remember if we were offered anything of a decent quality......we gave 1/2 of our bottle away to strangers. . . Rooms were relatively clean, but our $70 per night upgrade got us a minute view of the pool and the bulk of the view was their rooftop satellites (we were on the 9th floor).. . All this glory for about $250 per night. . . Decent location - would never stay there again.. . We were told we would have complimentary wifi - it was $14 per day!!. . Someone's POOPED IN sheets were sittingin the hallway all morning. . . Elevators took at least 5-10 minutes at any time of day other than around 8am.
Regular rooms. Not much to complain about. The self parking is kind of far so keep this in mind when you decide to valet or not. . . I really do like that Fat Tuesday and earls is here. . . Be sure to check out the miracle miles shops. Convenient location.
You enter Planet Hollywood through a very modern-looking lobby, but don't expect that style or modernity to be found elsewhere in the hotel.  Our room was clean, but the armoire that housed the TV and the ironing board had a gaping spot where a mini fridge used to be/should have been. There was obvious wear and tear on the furniture and the door (who wants to stay in a hotel room that looks beat up?) The fixtures in the bathroom were leftover from the days when the hotel was the Aladdin (the shower faucet even said 'Aladdin' on it!) Our phone didn't work - they sent one guy up to inspect it and said they would send another to replace it, but never did. They also forgot to take our credit card at check-in, which meant that we couldn't charge anything to our rooms for the first day/night. There were loud mechanical noises going on throughout the second night making it difficult to sleep (plus we could loudly hear the shower and bathroom noises from the adjacent rooms). Service at the pool (we paid for a daybed in the 21-over section) was lacking, and the spa, while great service, felt very old and out of date (and was still reminiscent of the Aladdin days). I wouldn't stay here again.
I stayed there this weekend May 16- May 19th and received the worst service I have ever received. I'm in the customer service industry and this place is lacking many many practices.. . The first night I arrived to find that the room I booked and the room I was getting were not the same I received a resort room with one king size bed for 3 people. There was no rooms available with 2 beds and I was given no other option but to wait until the next day. They could not even provide me with a cot! . . The next day I called in the morning to see when my next room would be available I was told it would be by 1230. Come 1230 it is still not available and I am told that they don't know when it would be available because a diamond member was staying in it. 2pm checked again nothing 3pm nothing 4pm they finally had it available but would not release the room keys to the persons I had listed that were also staying in the room. They told that person that I had not added them as occupants which he had clearly seen me do the first night. Finally we get in our room with 2 queen size beds (in what they called their resort room). . . In the new room the bathroom smelled like sewage constantly. . . In both rooms there was no refrigerator.  . . Housekeeping did not make the  bed because there was a suitcase next to it. . . There was no free wifi. (That's a big deal nowadays guys and a pretty standard practice) . . All in all no one was helpful. No one could provide me with better options for my inconvenience. And the staff lacked friendliness, eye contact, and problem solving skills. . . At 350 a night I could have gone anywhere else fairly comparable and next time I will.  . . The only plus was the size of the bathroom was great and the miracle mile shops are attached.
After reading a number of the yelp reviews before my stay I was very worried about what we might get as people seem to either love or hate their stay here. I went down to LV for 5 nights on a girls trip and we had reserved two rooms. We had requested adjoining rooms, which for some reason they were unable to accommodate (as one of our rooms had a door to adjoin to it's neighbour (who checked out the day after we arrived). That wasn't a big deal because we were on the same floor so it was fine. . . As other reviews have said, there is often a long line when you arrive for check in, so be prepared to wait. Though as we walked the strip and checked out other hotels there also appeared to be long line ups to check in (and for cabs too!). Customer service was a bit lacking - and sometimes there representatives were just plain unhelpful - I would expect more from a town that basically runs on customer service. . . Rooms: They rooms were fine. We had reserved the standard room with 2 queen beds. Great size (especially for 3 ladies with suitcases) and the bathrooms were a good size as well with lots of counter space. There is no mini fridge or coffee maker in the rooms - those are an extra charge. WiFi is a total pain at the hotel - and only includes one device per room though we were told they are in the process of changing their policy to include 2 devices per room. . . The Pool: The pool area is fine. Can be quite busy on the weekend, but not a terribly relaxing pool area. Seems like a bit of a wasted opportunity especially when compared with other hotels. There are two small pools on either side of the area (one is 21+) and there is this massive cement area with lots of loungers set up between them. There is no shade and no landscaping to add any ambiance. If you want to lounge by the pool and relax go elsewhere. If you want to party with a bunch of frat kids you might be happy.  . . Overall: I would stay at PH again if I got a great deal (our average price was ~$120 night) though would prefer to pay a bit more and stay elsewhere on the strip.
After checking out of the biggest nightmare of my life ( The QUAD which is NOT renovated). We checked in to Planet Hollywood which was amazing as always. So clean, the beds are so conformable , the service is great. They have us a late check out for free because of our horrible experience at the other hotel.The casino is great and the location is great. Take advantage of the PF Changs happy hr specials its defiantly worth it. The room service was  great and they have the late night option you can order anytime of the day or night. . . I highly recommend it!
Slow service and understaffed, Planet Hollywood is running on west coast time. Sub par amenities. The rooms were dismal.
I had my wallet taken during my stay and was in a state of panic this morning when I only had $1 to my name and 2 hrs til my flight. To the awesome gentleman working at the luggage check out front: I didn't catch your name, but the $5 you pulled out of your own pocket changed the course of my luck...right after you gave ne the money, I ran into a couple people taking the same flight home, and all I needed to get to the airport was exactly $5 since we split the cab fare. You savedme from missing my flight. Thank you - it was refreshing to be touched with a stranger's kindness, and I will make sure to find you when I'm back next month.  I've always liked this hotel, but you've officially made me a lifelong fan. Thanks again!
The worst experience ever. My friend booked this hotel for her birthday weekend. We arrive, with a reservation of two queen beds and we received one. They holed us up in a ADA room. Basically refused to do anything about it or even apologize for the change. . . No mini fridge. Took over an hour to get a cot. Lots of attitude from the staff and managers. Water wouldn't drain in the tub, so you end up showering in a few inches of water by the time you are done. . . Do not stay here! For what we paid, you should get top notch service and the room you reserved? Right?
My friend and I went to Planet Hollywood expecting good things. We were unpleasantly surprised.  When we checked in, Miles did not bother to mention the 2 queen room we booked was unavailable for the night. We had to lug our stuff all the way to our room before we saw that we were stuck in a king room. We had to lug our stuff back down because the phone didn't work in the room, and we couldn't call the front desk. When we walked back down, Miles assured us we could move the next day, but we were stuck in the king for the night. I asked for a rollaway. He said they were sold out. . . Knowing Miles wasn't good for much, I spoke with Royce. He was friendly, but also said the queen rooms were sold out. Royce checked, but found no history that we were supposed to bemoved to a better room the next day. He did notate it, however, and get me a rollaway. Sold out, huh? Guess not!. . Got a queen room the next day: vomit on the door, hair dryer broken, remote didn't work, leak in the bathroom, broken shower head and chipped furniture. . . Redeeming factors: Royce & Techa at the front desk were stellar, & the housekeeping staff was friendly (although didn't seem to notice the vomit on the door?!?). The casino was also very nice. . . You're paying for location at PH. That is all. The rooms are gross (the two I've seen).  If you're going for Vegas to relax in your room at any point, stay elsewhere.
The worst hotel experience ever. I will write a longer review later about my horrible experience. I DO NOT recommend this hotel at all. DO NOT stay here.
I'm actually shocked by all the terrible reviews Planet Hollywood seems to have received - we had a wonderful experience here!  We came with two other couples specifically to see Britney Spears and were pleasantly surprised with how great the hotel was.  The staff was all really helpful and friendly, we checked right in and found there was so much to offer right in our area.  The restaurants are all amazing inside, the shops are great and it certainly helped that Brit's concert was right downstairs!  She was pretty much ALL over the hotel so it made the experience that much more fun for my girlfriends and I. . . We stayed in February, but was shocked at how warm is was even then so it was really convenient having tons of stores in our hotel allowing us to purchase tank tops and sundresses so we'd be comfortable walking the strip!. . The room itself was really nice and clean, bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was gorgeous!  Seems like a funny thing to say, but as a girl spending 5 days in Vegas, you want a nice bathroom to get all dolled up in!  It was also super affordable which is obviously a plus!  Getting cabs were a breeze too because the staff was all so helpful.. . I'm looking forward to trying out other hotels next time we head to Vegas, but I would definitely stay here again!
good location and mid-low priced but i wouldn't come here. it's a refurbished/reskinned aladdin and they didn't put much effort into making it NOT aladdin. The rooms have a crazy weird layout.. a standard double queen room have the beds facing the tv.. that makes sense. Upgrade to a double queen suite for more space and a bigger bathroom and you have the two beds face the window that overlooks the pool/strip.. and the tv is off to the side. Ok so who cares about tv when you're in vegas, right? But still, it's a dumb floorplan. Not to mention, the tv unit is also the closet/dresser drawer unit. wth? LOL. okaaay. I would imagine the closet area should be near the bathroom, but whatever. . . wifi and internet is $20 a day. toiletries are generic crap. . . the miracle mile shops that are attached to the hotel are crap stores that you can find in any low end mall. fitting as the high end mall is across the street at Crystals anyway. . . The crowd here is perfect for the location, and for the star headliner of the ph Axis.. but i personally would avoid this crowd at all costs. . . i won't be back again.
I think this place lives up to it's 4 star rating! Yes, it's not as frilly as the 5 star reviews, but it's definitely nicer than some 4 star resorts that I've stayed at in Vegas (cough, cough, Monte Carlo). . . Everything looked very new. They have great quick food choices in the lobby and mall area. I asked for a room upgrade, and got a strip view for FREE! The pool isn't amazing..its just a huge slab of concrete with 2 pools on either side. Not much room to sit by the pools. I do love that they have poolside gambling. We played poker and black jack and got premium drinks for free (while gambling) for hours.. . The biggest negative - parking lot was SOOO far! All in all, if you're looking for a place to stay comfortably, but not spend all your time in, this is a good option.
It was a very nice hotel and I enjoyed my stay. The room was very nice with a huge standup shower and large tub.
We stayed over the Memorial Day Weekend holiday, and I have to say, I was less than impressed with the overall experience.. . Check in- while slow, was friendly- I wish I could remember the girl's name who checked us in, but she was really sweet; she took note of the fact that I am 6 months pregnant and made sure that we were on a high floor, facing away from the strip where she said the room would be quieter. . . Room- it's just OK. There was a broken drawer in the tv case/vanity that was fixed about 10 minutes after we arrived by an engineer (maybe they should have these things fixed before they check people into the rooms? I know hotels, havingworked in them for years- you can put a room "out of order" if something needs to be fixed). He was pleasant, and it was fixed quickly, but it was a bit awkward. The bed was comfy, we had enough space for the two of us. The bathroom was ehhh... minimal water pressure in the shower coming out of a shower head that has to have been there since the Aladdin days. . . WiFi- the note that is given on check in informs you of what you get by paying the "resort fee". Yet, when you go to sign on to the WiFi, it tells you that you will be charged (there is no note that one device is complimentary). Trying to get ahold of someone in this hotel to ask whether it will truly be complimentary is like trying to get ahold of God. Impossible. We tried for two days to call the Front Desk at all different times of the day, and finally reached someone who confirmed that yes, one device was complimentary. Once we got it, it was slower than molasses in January. Time to update!. . Housekeeping- nice, prompt, friendly when we passed them in the hall on our way out for breakfast. She asked what room we were in, and said she would clean our room next, so that it was done by the time we got back. I appreciated that! It would have been nice if they had emptied the water out of the ice bucket and replaced the bag though.. . Casino- UGH. SO UNIMPRESSIVE. . . Restaurants- We ate at Burgr, the food was pretty mediocre. . . Pool- Where do I begin? Band aids on the ground, outdated lounge chairs (what is up with the "No Man's Land" in between the two pools?) and NO COCKTAIL SERVICE unless you happen to get lucky and get a place by the pool. Come on, PH- it's Memorial Day Weekend. Every single cab driver and person we talked to said that it's one of your busiest weekends of the year. I might not be drinking alcohol, but I would have ordered at least one or two of your $12 bottles of water and probably some food had someone come by. The entire 2-3 hours that I sat there, not one single cocktail waitress even came close to me, and the chairs where I was sitting (in No Man's Land) were PACKED. It's hotter than Hades in that area, and no umbrellas, so you should be able to deduce that that will make people THIRSTY. This means $$ for you. It's not hard to figure out.. . It's a great location, nice and centrally located, but I wish we had shelled out a little bit more money and stayed some place a little nicer. I'll never stay here again.
I didn't like this hotel.  Service was poor.  Hotel uses deceptive practices.  I was told at check-in that I could use the $25.00 food credit at any restaurant inside the hotel and just to have the bill charged to my room.  When I checked out I was told that the $25.00 food credit wasn't good for the restaurant I chose.  I noticed other deceptive practices as well with regard to the resort fee.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel.  If you decide to stay just be aware they will try to get every penny from you that they can and will use deceptive practices to get it.
