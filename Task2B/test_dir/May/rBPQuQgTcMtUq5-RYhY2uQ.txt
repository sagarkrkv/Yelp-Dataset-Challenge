Most important: skip the line if you are a platinum, diamond, or seven seas member.  Otherwise, the line is long, expect to wait for 30 minutes or so.  The separate line is close by look for the glass doors.. . The quality of the food is ok, nothing really stands out and not a lot of disasters.  To describe the sad state of buffets on the strip, this is one of the better ones.. . One thing I must stay is pretty good, is the macaroons and creme brulee.  Save your appetite for these.
Figured I'd give this buffet a shot and went for Sunday dinner. I expected it to be good especially since it's on the higher end of the price scale but I was wrong. There seriously wasn't a thing in this place that I thought was good except the crepes. Skip this buffet!
Good food. Nice wait staff. Horrible noise level due to carts going by tables laden with dirty dishes. Had to stop talking each time one went by, which was every two minutes.
The breakfast at Le Village is amazing. With build your own crepes, build your own omelettes and huge selection of other dishes, there's something for everyone.
A year ago this was my favorite buffet in Vegas.  Perhaps I had just tried a few better places since that visit, but I felt very disappointed in the offerings this year. There were no hot crab legs, most of the mussels were closed and inedible, and the macarons were dry and stale tasting. I couldn't find much that I wanted to eat- even the cheese selection was lacking. I sipped on some onion soup and ate a cold baguette and left disappointed. Hopefully it was just an off night, but I won't be back to find out.
My wife and I dined at Le Buffet on 5-13. We enjoyed the French village setting and the food selections were good and also interesting. Save room for a crepe, they are outstanding.  The service was very adequate.. After many trips to Las Vegas this is the first buffet we have gone to. Even though the dinner was comped, we agreed that it would be a value at the price. . Do yourselves a favor, go on Open Table and make a reservation. You will avoid the line by entering through the door that is just to the left of the main entrance.
I liked it. I was here at lunch and ate mostly seafood (mussels, shrimp, Seafood Bouillabaisse) and later crab (we had a late lunch and they switch their menu to dinner at 3pm on week days) and it was all good. Also tried some grilled veggies (but grilling makes them all taste the same). The caprese salad was good. Sushi was a miss (there were 2 types and they weren't good). For dessert I enjoyed some flan and creme brulee. I was excited about the macaroons, but the 2 that i tried were too sweet. Wish I left some room for the infamous crepes, but I didn't so I just had a bite of someone else's berry crepe and it was delicious!
Decisions decisions are you here for food or dessert? if you want dessert there are too many selections but the very few are good. Must try items include flan, creme brulee, and Crepes made to order. Crepes are delicious!!! Food wise we like saffron rice, pita spread, and fish. The duck meat was ok. A bit dry. I'm not a meat person but the better half who bans vegetables said the meat selections were ok, nothing to rave about. We got groupon for two adults and bottle if wine for 20 a person. That deal will bring us back.  Other than that I wouldn't say food is very good since there are Just took many other competitors.
Overpriced. Food was subpar the salad bar and desert bar were quite nice though. Doubtful that I will return. The waitstaff were nice and were attentive though.
This was a decent buffet on the strip. They offered a lot of variety at each station with good quality food. The dessert bar was my favorite- the creme brulee and macaroons were the highlight. However, the wait to get in was a bit long. We stood in line for 30 min waiting for a table for 4 to open up at 3 pm on a Tuesday.
I usually try to avoid buffets whenever possible, but wound up here for a Sunday brunch, with bottomless mimosas. Most of the food was not bad but it was not great either, considering the price. I was letdown by the desserts (I expect more from a French place).
We went for breakfast and it was The Bomb.com!  A crepe bar, are you kidding me? Wow it was really great food and great options. I believe i paid around $30. Bring your club card. You get $2 off your meal. Every penny counts! Check out my pics! Yum
This was a pleasant surprise, my friends and I walked around forever trying to find a place to eat and because I was having a toothache I really didn't want to go to a buffet but long story short we ended up here.... . Sat night-short line.. I was a bit nervous.. WHY SO EASY?!. . the food was actually pretty good, decent meat selection, food quality was not bad at all, the variety was a bit lacking but it was enough! we all got one free glass of wine too which was a nice surprise. . . desserts would probably have to be their strongest part though, with the dessert bar and crepe station it was a home run!
Good but weird waitresses put labels on ur bottles of orange juice quit smelling my cup to see if it has alcohol in it
I was warned by my friends not to come here :( But I ignored their advice and I woefully regret it... Le Village Buffet is THEE spot that my cousins and I would bust a mission to go to when I was little. I have so many good memories of this place and I really wanted to come back here to revisit those pleasant memories... Well... those are nothing more than illusions of grandeur and definitely the failures of romanticizing about the past. . . I came here alone for breakfast when my friends were all sleeping and recovering from our nighttime adventures. I remember it was really cheap, about $20-something for the breakfast buffet. The people were very nice and accommodating... . . BUT THE FOOD!!!!! . . Bleh, the plate I grabbed was so horrible I had to cut up and re-arrange the food on my plate to make it look like I actually touched it so the lady would take it away. . . I liked their eggs florentine, the ham the grapefruit, the fruits and the orange juice... but quiche was too oily, the selection of scrambled eggs were disappointing and the steak and potatoes were overcooked. The crepe was "okay" but the bananas were too soggy, I just brushed it aside and ate the outside part with the nutella. I didn't even want to eat the breakfast pastries... it was just chocolate croissants, muffins, danish, cinnabuns, etc... nothing special or out of the ordinary... . . This experience does not even come close to how AMAZING I remember Le Village Buffet to be... Definitely not worth stuffing my face for :(
Been here a few times when I'm in Vegas. They have an average food selection. But this place does give off a cute French vibe that makes you feel like you're in Paris. I wish they had more meats to choose from though because I'm a huge meat person. The only meat that was good was the prime rib. The rest were average.
The people working there are always swamped so always give them a little more room as they get cranky gamblers, swarms of families on a daily basis. . . I thought the food could use more work as I was surprised to find sushi rolls and sesame seaweed in the selection.
One of the best buffets on the strip. The layout of the food is in 'shops' and breaks the food into groupings based on the area. There are countless stations filled with great food that never fails to satisfy. . The selection is always vast and varied to cater to everyone in your group. There is often a wait, but it's well worth it!
