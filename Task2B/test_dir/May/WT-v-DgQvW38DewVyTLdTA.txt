Clean and functional rooms for a great price. . . This is quite obviously one of the older places on the strip and it seems that Circus Circus knows it and doesn't really care or try to keep up or compete with the rest of the strip. We stayed in the Circus Manor across the street from the big hotel. There is NOTHING luxurious or fancy about this place. You get a shower and a bed. The only high tech thing in their rooms are their Keurig coffee makers which are located IN THE BATHROOM. Totally didn't use that thing. GROSS. You do get a lot of space in your room so if you have kids this would be a good thing. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. I was able to get full nights sleep with out tossing and turning.. . You pay a $15 resort fee per day with your stay, as if you would really use their facilities besides the casino unless you are traveling with children. Everything just seems cheesy and run down. Old video games, carnival games, rides and "circus" performers. They do offer free parking which is great! The pool area is decent. . . If you are wanting a luxurious Las Vegas experience don't stay here. If you want to stretch your dollar this is a ok place. We were only in the room to shower and sleep so it turned out to be a great value. Check in was easy, check out was easier. You are able to do express check out via text message. With the amount of volume that Circus Circus gets I really feel like they could put in a tad bit more effort in keeping this place modern. Even just a few new coats of paint and some small details like faucet fixtures in the bathrooms and carpets. . . I wouldn't say avoid the Circus, just know you are getting what you pay for.
This hotel is full of creepy drunks and non drunks and it's suppose to be kid friendly?  I think it's too dark in this hotel.. . I just came back from Vegas a few hours ago. I stayed at circus circus as a last minute trip.  The rates are super cheap. . My room was in one of those manors unfortunately. I don't know why it's not even part of the main hotel.  It's a pretty scary and dangerous place to stay especially walking at night or evening for that matter. . . It's away from everything.  The signs inside and outside of the hotel were unclear. Looking for the registration desk and stuff was annoying cause it was soo dArk! I mean geez.. . . When my friend and i walked to our room, the cleaning crews were still inside cleaning like really? We checked in and hour after check in time and the rooms aren't even ready? . . Pros: $10 slot machine credit upon checking in. . Free boarding pass printing. . Cheap rates( expect to get what you paid for). . 24 hour deli inside main hotel. . Free parking!. . Cons: scary at night . . Not many places open late around this hotel. . Staying at the manor
This review is for the Casino Tower rooms. It's convenient how the elevators are separated into ones that only go up to certain floors. Really helpful in avoiding crowded elevators. Also very convenient that you just ride up and down and you're already there in the Casino where all the action occurs. We got a room on the 5th floor. The view was absolutely hideous. It included a view of the roof of a smaller building along with many pipes, with the Stratosphere and LVH in the back.  The room itself was clean.. beds were comfortable. The room had a flat screen TV, having stayed in the Manors before with those really old 1990's TV's, this was a really nice upgrade. The room was extremely spacious and it was very nice. The only reason for 1 less star is that the "flush" sound the toilet makes is EXTREMELY loud. You can hear it a few rooms away, not even kidding. Overall, it was pleasant. Highly recommend the casino towers!
Never go back. Went to do yoga and floor was soaked in our room- hate to think why. Outdated and Adventure dome more for young kids
Buyer beware: the budget pricing cannot make up for the downtrodden ambiance, decor and general air of this place . . Have mercy on yourself; and if you can't afford a better place on the strip, stay in motel 6 instead.
Worst place I've ever stayed period. Service was/is awful. Check in and out was everything but convenient and smooth not to mention over priced. I've stayed at many hotels on and off the strip in every star ranking. Not only did the check in process waiting in line at the early am hours take 1hr and 15 min but when we were speaking to one out of 2 representatives it added another 20 min. The same questions and acknowledgments were repeated way too many times to get the same answers. Our rooms were only clean by looking at it from a glimpse. We were unable to make check out due to our water being shut off for 2hr. Had we of been made aware of this prior we would have planned showering accordingly. Instead no awareness was brought to light and we had to pay a late check out fee. Even after speaking to the front desk rep about us needing a later check out, housekeeping arrives 10-15min later without knocking and entering the room saying she needs to clean for the next guests. I understand maintenance checks happen and issues occur but lack of communication with your guests is unacceptable. Guest awareness and staff communication is key. There was no customer service and the little time I spent in the room was miserable. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
Too crammed up & smokey. I like the look of the outside in the night time with the lights though. Happy about my favorite slot machine they have there too. I also like the fact that they have two Merry go rounds, because instead of riding horses, your sitting at slot machines, going around & around. LOL. . My brother was disappointed that they didn't have much kidie games like a real "Circus Circus" would. I guess he was expecting this circus circus to look like the one in Reno; much better!! Even I think so too.... . Glad I came here once, just to check it out. That way, I don't have to come here again to waste my time...
Discretionary post.. . I could see how easy it is for people to not like this place, but as one recent yelper guest mentioned, you have to acknowledge you are getting what you pay for, which is mediocre at best.  Definitely not the worst place to stay, but many of you would be better off and happier spending the extra money to stay somewhere else closer to the exciting part of the strip.  If you give this place high marks, it is probably based more on the experience than the look.. . Good things:. . - It's cheap.  It's really not a bad choice if you're on a budget.. - It's a quick walk to the CVS in case you need a few extra things for your stay.  Less than a mile north on Las Vegas Blvd.. - They have Keurig coffee machines in the rooms rather than the ordinary ones that aren't even clean.. - Plenty of closet space for personal belongings.. - The view outside the window is not actually of a neighboring building's roof.. - FREE WIFI!  I know for a fact that there are other hotels along the strip that actually charge you for it.  This is one critical factor that can determine someone's level of happiness.. . Bad things:. . - It's far from the actual Las Vegas shenanigans.  A cab ride to the other side of the strip can potentially run you up as much as $20 depending on who drives you and when.. - The shops around this place don't tend to open very early.  But then again, not many people tend to wake up early in LAS VEGAS.. - You might have to deal with that turn that goes into either the parking garage that leads to the check-in desk, or into the Manor rooms.  There should be a signal light there, or at least stop signs.  Cars usually plow right through there regardless of pedestrians crossing or not.. . Things that aren't necessarily good or bad, but are left up to the person to interpret and decide:. . - This hotel has a ton of kids as well as gang members.  The same people who react to this can respond 2 different ways:  "How can you like gang members?" and "How can you dislike kids?"  Not all gang members are bad.  And many kids are.. - They still have CRT TVs.  Of course they work, but it's tough to watch things on those after watching flat-screens for a while.. . All in all, choose to stay here if you aren't picky.  But if you're trying to "impress" someone, be ready to get laughed at.  I'll let you imagine the dialogue.
Not worth the money I paid.  Motel 6 is cleaner and has better staff.  I was so excited to stay here with my children.  What a horrible mistake.  I had to practically beg the bell boy to assist with the luggage.  They were so irritated that I interrupted their conversation.  Finally get to the room.  45 minutes later the luggage showed up.  The beds sheets were stained!! The painting was half done and the "queen". Were no more than full size.  The room smelled like piss!  I have two in diapers and I could smell it.  The front desk does not care.  Fire alarm at 12:30am and not on employee seemed concerned or cared.  The next day we were checking out thank God!!  The bell boy was aggressive and told guest to get off his elevator.  One man got on anyway, he just glared at him the whole time.  He got off and the bell boy said "it's so hard not to say anything, then I just get pulled I to the office.  "Not sure what his problem was as the guest did nothing wrong.  Then we are loading the car the bell boy puts down our stuff half of it, including my husbands computer down in the middle of the driveway.  Another guest runs it over before I had a chance to grab it.  The two bell boys witnessed the whole thing almost laughing as I try and run the other driver down.  No one helps.  The bell boy just asked for his tip so he could leave!!!  Security gets there with the supervisor told is we were shot out of luck.  Asked us why we didn't run the driver down or why we put our luggage down there.  It was YOUR bell boy.  Unhelpful apologetic anything.  It was so bad!  I was traveling with 2 under 2!!  I will never stay here again and I will write bad reviews everywhere. Fear not the management and the hotel do not give a shit!!!  Plenty of other cheap hotels in Vegas that are not this bad!  And 150 a night is not a cheap hotel!!
Very comfortable and hospitipal environment at all times, was our experience. No, it's not perfect. But neither is getting bent over for Ten X'S the cost else where for not much better accommodations at so called high-end luxury resorts. It's all about perceptions in LV. No smoke and mirrors here! Just great bang for the buck! Nice. Simple. Easy. Casual. Relaxed. Unobtrusive. No pressure. Family friendly. Comfortable. Very underrated dining and entertainment options. Secure and safe environment. Best thrill ride-El Loco roller coaster-in all of LV!Easily less than 1.00 a ride with wristband and ride warrior commitment! LOL! Personally rode it 30 times in a row, no problem, on a Wednesday. Seriously-what's not to like at Circus Circus? Room 28703 in Skytower provides kick-ass view of North LV! We will absolutely be glad to be back to Circus Circus!
It was great that they offered free half an hour circus shows. They also have games at the second floor where kids can stay at.
For $36 dollars a night it's a awesome deal. I stayed here from 5/10/2014 checked out 5/13/2014 we booked 2 rooms. A room with 2 queen beds on the west towers 26th floor and it had a horrible vomit smell, we were able to change rooms but that room had roaches, disappointed. The other room was a king size in west towers 21st floor. This room wasn't bad, sink was dirty but overall not bad. The location was more south than I realized. This was my 2nd trip to Vegas. My first was at Cesar's Palace and we didnt had children with us but this time we did so opted for a more family oriented location. I would recommend  if you have children but wouldn't if your with your S.O or friends 21+. You'll have more fun else where on the north side of the strip.
Circus Circus is a hotel you only want to stay at if you have kids. It is very very old and run down appearing. The free circus acts every 15 minutes are pretty entertaining as well as the games. It really is like going to a carnival. I definitely would not recommend this place for people without children. It's ok, but nothing compared to MGM or the Mirage, ect.
Definitely not the fanciest hotel in vegas, but it's fairly cheep. They offer quite a bit for the price,  but are still located on the strip. Good if you want the Vegas experience with breaking your pockets in comparison to other hotel casinos on the strip.
Only thing I have to say that's bad is that the kids games are expensive. You can play 20 bucks and almost come out empty handed. Other than that, the place was friendly and exciting.free shows here too
On family vacation with the family and we brought our 7 year daughter to the adventure dome for a night of fun.  It took her a moment to get warmed up to the rides, but once she hot used to it she was all over the place and had a ball, her word's "this is the best night if my life".
This is one of the first hotels that I have stayed at prior to the Venetian. It is a hotel for kids. The rooms are not as fancy as the Venetian. There is a coupon book given for guests. Typically, I use the buy 1 get 1 game coupon or I get the free donut from Krispy Kreme. In certain rooms, you can smell smoke. People smoke in the casino, so you will smell it when walking to the adventuresome or the main gaming area.
Worst hotel in the area... Never stay here... Worst service.... Bathroom tap lickeage... No toothpaste... No shampoo.... I paid $580 for 2 days... Worst worst hotel
Despite the false bad assumptions people have about this hotel, the West Tower and Main Tower rooms are really nice! Its a good experience.  There are, however,  an abundance of children and people everywhere so it gets irritating trying to walk to and through the casino.
(This could possibly go in the Midway, but I am firm believer that the free acts in Vegas (as they dwindle further and further) need to have their own reviews.). . A little rinky dinky.. . I will admit. Not the best thing I have ever seen. A couple of factors play into this of course. . . 1. We were there for the first act of the day.. and we were early for that.. . 2. We only stuck around to see the one act.. . So I won't hold it against them too much.. but the morning's act was a chair juggler. A little bit ho' hum I guess... lacked some of the pizzaz of a trapeeze artist or something of that nature. . . It's a bit of a tired area and the seating is just metal bleachers (if you choose to sit, but there is plenty of vantage points around the midway if not).. . The reason it's a 4 star review, is it's FREE!.. and as I mentioned before, in a world like Vegas that gets more expensive by the day it seems, it's really refreshing to see a hotel still embrace the sentiment of getting you in or at it's front door with a free attraction.
I haven't been to Circus Circus since I was a kid so I decided to be nostalgic and stay here again. It has great parking! & *always park on the third floor since you can walk into the casino without use of the elevator*! It's a great place for kids. The arcade is HUGE ! The staff is so nice & helpful!! They are so friendly and really care. They should upgrade eventually but regardless they'll get customers. They also need better room service so you can order food up from the restaurants! My overall experience has been very good
Housekeeper STOLE a few of my medication pills for my torn acl.. . Also at check in my cousin informed the front desk that we had someone with crutches and my grandma who can't walk too much.. And our room was the LAST room down the hall. For a Tuesday check in at a hotel with more than one building.. I'm sure not all the vacant rooms left were at the end of the hall.. Something closer to he elevator I'm sure was available.. . The security who took the report was nice as well as the hotel room itself. Some positives are that there is free parking, the buffet is okay (not great but not terrible) and the rates were decent.. . I asked my cousin if she had anything to add and she said that the room smells and then reminded me that we were momentarily stuck in an elevator downstairs yesterday.
We were headed to Vegas for a family reunion, and I was not thrilled that my brother chose "The Clown Hotel" for us to stay at, especially since we all left our kids at home. However, I was impressed with the hotel. The room was very nice (we stayed in the West Tower), the beds were super comfy, and all of the employees we encountered were wonderful. . . I stupidly left some personal articles in the room after checkout (including $100 in cash!), and the hotel called to let me know, then graciously mailed them to me. All I had to pay was mailing costs. . . I would have no reservations about staying here in the future. The Midway was fun, the hotel had plenty of activities going on (be sure to check out Vince Neils Tatuado!), and we had a great time. I highly recommend the hotel, since I had an amazing experience.
You could not pay me a progressive jackpot to stay here again.. . If you want bed bug bites, chlorine filled air, the dirtiest and ugliest cocktail servers, and quite possibly one of the worst themed or thought of hotels ever...well unfortunately this place is for you.. . 100% positive there is bed bugs as all of us got bit in our room.. . I highly recommend dropping acid like Johnny Depp does in "Fear and Loathing" to get you through the weekend if you have to step foot in this place.
