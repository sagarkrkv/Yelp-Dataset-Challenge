Amazing!!  Best steak I ever had.. its hard to turn down what they offer you because its so good.. Definitely worth the price. Salad bar is awsome.(:
Be careful when you enter.  The doors are very heavy and the edges are sharp.  If you are not strong the door can come back and stab you in the leg.. . My family visited this location for dinner.  My 20 year old sister in law had the door hit her in her boot.  It ripped a hole straight through her boot and her sock and ripped a hole in her foot.  She was bleeding everywhere.  Her foot was messed up for two weeks, and it still is.. . We alerted the manager to the issue and he forwarded us off to the corporate office as if we wanted a pay day.  What are they going to reimburse us for?  A band-aid?  No one even said sorry.. . The corporate office didnt even call us, they automatically forwarded us to an insurance adjuster who later sent a letter that we received today, stating that the door is not hazardous because they inspected it and there are no sharp edges.. . We visit Texas De Brazil 2 times each month and have done so for the past 2 years.  Because of this situation and the obvious lack of care for their customers, we will not be going back.  We never asked for any money.  The least they could do is, for someone to acknowledge that a mistake was made, buy the girl a new shoe, and treat her to dinner.. . If you do visit, don't get hurt, because you will probably bleed out on the floor, while the employees watch and pretend like it never happened. . . Hurry up and file down the door before the insurance adjuster shows up!  I have a catering business myself, and this is not the way we or anyone else should ever treattreat loyal customers.. . Im taking my business to fogos.
The service was great. Food was very good. Thankful to come here after such a bad experience at via Brazil. Will definitely be back. Would give 6 starts if I could. Peter out server was awesome.
I was there this week... and all the cuts of meat and flavor is very good, but; I think the best thing there is mashed potatoes and desserts. Good service. . I'll be see you soon. Maybe on this week.
We went. Aprox 20 ladies. And the service was excellent. Food delicious.  Thank you Texas de Brazil
The entire experience was exceptional! Excellent and tender meats, a huge variety from their salad bar a perfect service! Definitely will be back. Prices are good for Las Vegas!
Richard was our server, fantastic young man and a master of his craft. The food was delicious+.  They deserve nothing short of 5 stars for both service and food preparation.
Incredible food, service was on point, and classy, fun atmosphere. Great for a group or for a date.
I came here with my family and we had an amazing dinner , food was delicious , I would give 5 stars but I can't ,due to the fact the I saw a  Roach under the table ): . . . I will definitely come back here again .
There is no question that this is really my favorite restaurant! The food and service are usually fantastic. I recently got sick after eating there, but to be honest it was really because I couldn't stop myself and ended up over eating. So if you can manage better self-control than Idid in my recent visit, and you love meat, then this too may become your favorite restaurant!
Number Brazilian QQB in town
We went there for our first time with some friends and it just replaced Disney as the happiest place on earth.. . If you like salads, there is am extensive salad bar of your favorite veggies.. . As for the main course, imagine a buffet where the buffet comes to you...Awesome right. You are the main attraction and various pieces of meats arrive to your table  to get your attention.. . My favorite is the flank steak but everything is delicious.. . Although it may be a bit pricey, it is definitely worth it.
Visit every time we're in Vegas now.  THE place for meat eaters.  I mean SERIOUS meat eaters.  They have a really great salad bar too if that's your thing. I make sure to come here hungry.  I grab a big heap of their Jasmine rice, topped with their onion/cilantro/lemon juice mix and then keep the meat coming.  My favorite is the Picanha steak.  Once I'm done, I roll my happy arse out the door.. . Server Tip: Ask for David if you can.  He's a hoot and very attentive.
When I frequent Las Vegas, I make it a priority to dine at Texas de Brazil.  This 5 star review is so deserving, and here's why.. . Let's get this out of the way first: RESERVATIONS ARE MANDATORY.  This place is busy every day of the week, so don't be a fool and make sure you book a reservation to get seated.. . The service is very professional and exceeds expectations.  From the host staff to the waiters and food carvers, every person that works here makes sure that every guest is served at a level of perfection.. . The food? MEAT GALORE.  I pretty much die and go to heaven when I eat here.  The flank steak and filets are amazing.  The lobster bisque is a party in your mouth.  Hell, even the cheesy bread is glorified hallelujah.  If you somehow can fit dessert in your expansive stomach, you can't go wrong with their extensive choices.. . Overall, I would say Texas de Brazil tops my food establishment choices in the country.  At $50 a head, it's actually worth it.
Meat meat meat and more meat. I honestly don't know how I am writing this review because I am in a meat-induced coma. I took my man here for dinner for his bday tonight. Originally we had planned to go to fogo de Chao but we were able to get a 15% discount with tdb so decided to go there. We are both signed up for the TDB email promotions and usually every year a few weeks before our bday we get a coupon for bogo dinner. This year for whatever reason we did not receive any coupon. Not that I mind paying full price I was just curious why no coupon so I decided to call and see what's up. I spoke with a manager who said they have no control over sending out the promotional stuff. All that comes from a 3rd party called fishbowl. He said I could try and contact them but ain't nobody got time for that! I told the manager we wanted to get a reservation asap because his bday is tomorrow and he said if we came tonight he would give us 15% off. Sweet! We made our reservation for 830.. . We arrived about 820 and were seated around 840. They were busy but not packed and as it was getting later it started clearing out. I checked out the salad bar and ended up with some olives, goat cheese, prosciutto, salmon and 3 dipping sauces for the meat. Only one I actually ate with the meat and that was the chimichurri. It was mmmm good. They also had  a mint sauce which I did not like it tasted like mint jello. And some kind of salsa. Try the chimichurri and u won't regret it. It complements the meat perfectly! I also got a big bowl of scalloped potatoes. Those were really tasty and I ended up getting more later. Our server also brought out 3 sides (mashed potatoes, fried bananas, and cheesy bread) as if we didn't have enough food. I sat down and flipped my card to green and the meat started coming. My favorite is the filet mingon it just melted in my mouth it was like butter. So good! I also tried the sausage, ribs, chicken and lamb which was super flavorful! I was pleasantly surprised. After I stuffed myself full of meat I decided since it was his bday we would get dessert. I told our server it was his bday and he said something like "well since it's your birthday you most certainly need some dessert" and brought over the tray of goodies. Bf picked out the Brazilian cheesecake and it came out with happy birthday written on the plate in chocolate sauce (see pic) and a candle for him to blow out. It was a nice touch nothing over the top they didn't come out singing or anything so that was cool. The cheesecake was damn tasty too but it was $8.75! Coulda bought the whole cake for that price. I kinda thought he was going to throw in the dessert for free because of his comment but whatever its not going to change my opinion on the place.. . All in all I was very satisfied out server was quick and efficient and even other servers assisted us when we needed something. Also we got the %15 discount which helped. Total for 2 dinners, a drink and dessert plus %15 off came to $104. Not including tip. I will be back in the future just not anytime soon. I can't imagine eating a meal like this but once a year.
