Service here sucks ass. Don't go in a party of two. They will completely ignore you. Rice cracker was a little too harsh on the teeth. . . Grilled pork belly totally awesome. . Food lags.. Service sucks. . Been waiting for someone to notice us for about 30 minutes.. . Don't even bother coming.
One of the best sushi places in town, the sushi is always fresh and they have a wide variety of specialty rolls. Parking is plentiful but it gets packed quickly here, even at first opening in the morning the place usually gets filled. Atmosphere is modern and clean and their prices are decent. Ayce lunch is about 22 and dinner is $27, service is usually always good as well despite being busy.
Sushi was average, nothing extraordinary. As far as freshness, it was. Selection was not as large as se of the other sushi places I've been to. Overall, it's a decent place just nothing that was over the top. Forgettable.
This is still one of my favorites, we go quite often after work. The pork belly and scallops are my favorite. We Love the ramen and creme brulee as well . It's a great place to go after a busy night at work, I run into many people here too in the industry.
I love this sushi place. The staff is always nice (with a few exceptions) and the fish is the best quality. If it's just two of you I would say to do the bar, the bar chefs are so funny to just hang out and talk to. Be warned though of you go  after 7:30 on any night there's a good 25-40 min wait
Have to say , visited a lot of AYCE places before but this one beats them all. 5 stars all the way for me! Try the "lasagna" roll or if you go for dinner, the stuff from the grill(super white tuna & Cajun salmon) is delicious! Also don't forget to get an AYCE stamp card , after 10 visits the 11th is free!
The service was great, atmosphere was comfortable, and the sushi was very good.
Grabbed dinner here the other night and we had a great experience. We got the all you can eat (AYCE) option and loved it. The atmosphere was nice and the staff was extremely friendly. The chefs did an excellent job preparing the food and they kept it coming pretty quickly. We tried out a lot of the sushi rolls and didn't have any that we wouldn't eat again. You can even make up and order your own rolls here which gives you a lot more options. The calamari app was excellent as well. Overall I would highly recommend this sushi place to anyone looking for a new sushi spot. We will be going back often. Enjoy
On my Vegas trip, my friend recommended to try this place out. All you can eat sushi?!! who can turn that down?  . Took a taxi here since it was off the Strip, about 5-10 mins. . Went on Mother's Day weekend and there was an hour long wait, not surprised.  The place is small and could be bigger but it is a really nice comfy intimate restaurant.. Sushi was really good, I personally recommend J.J, Pete's, Tiger Eye and the green tea ice cream!  Lunch was around $22 bucks, not too bad for all you can eat.. Will definitely come back during my next Vegas trip.
When I first moved to Vegas, my family and I constantly went to Sushi-mon. Then when we moved away, Goyemon opened so whenever I visited Vegas, I always had to go to Goyemon. It was amazing. It was probably my favorite AYCE sushi place in Vegas. . . The sushi was yummy, they always have some type of specials on the board, and they have other things on the menu for non-sushi eaters. So if you were to come with a huge group of people, you can get a mix of things. . . One of my FAVORITE items from Goyemon has to be the salmon belly! It is delicious, fatty, and never a disappointment whenever I get it. So why, in heaven's name, did I give it 3 stars? Well ... let me tell you a story.. . Goyemon had their 3rd Anniversary Customer Appreciation event and it was supposed to last 2 days. They had a list of special items for those days, which included blue fin and toro. With that, they offered the ability for you to make reservations. My friends and I decided to make a reservation for the 2nd day of the event since the 1st day of the event didn't work out with our schedules. . . The excitement built up even more after we found out that on the first day of the event, they did AYCE toro and AYCE uni! OMG! Like, I can't even WAIT. . . So when we went in for our reservation, my excitement turns a little bit sour. Why? Well, we had our reservation for 7:30 pm. We get there a little bit early but we have to wait for a table. I'm sorry .. I thought I had a reservation. So what we find out is .. they are still accepting walk ins and because they're typically a walk in restaurant, they don't quite grasp the reservation concept down that well. We actually didn't get seated until maybe at 8 PM.. . And then they tell us that there is no AYCE toro tonight, only AYCE uni and waygu beef. Well, gee, thanks. What's the point of having a reservation then? Why would you give AYCE toro one night and not the other night? I wanted to flip multiple tables but since we waited for the table, sat down, and were ready to order, we just stayed. . . So my experience from that is just really really sour. So I learned to just walk in on the days they have yummy specials. That way, I won't be missing out REGARDLESS of what they say. . . So Goyemon gets an average from me. I still like them and will continue to go to them for AYCE sushi. Service can be slow sometimes though and the servers will look at you funny when you order 20 orders of one thing. . . Oh and LOVE their yuzu sorbet (:
It was hot outside, but cool inside. We went for an AYCE lunch and enjoyed every bite. The service was fast and friendly. This is no non-sense eating establishment. Most of the clientele with the exception of yours truly were locals. The experience was good, presentation of the food was nice and everything was fresh. We will be back. I have the feeling that if you go for dinner you better plan on waiting cause this place is a local favorite.
My sister, who is a bigger foodie but doesn't write, lives out here and was the food and beverage manager for Ritz Carlton in D.C. so she knows her stuff. I recommended this place considering the # of reviews and 4 stars on Yelp. However, although I didn't try the food, I wanted to leave this dirty smelling joint asap. The place smelled like old fish, was dark, loud, and very crowded. Because I was so hungry, we left and went to her usual spot Umiya. Considering these places are all you can eat raw sushi joints, I'd rather be a bit more picky and eat at a more cleaner establishment. Even if it was the late lunch hour rush, the establishment should be clean and not smell like the kitchen if they're serving raw fish (my pet peeve). Dahmmit...I feel terrible for writing a bad review about this joint, but Umiya was just that much better and even a few bucks cheaper with the free drinks.
Used to be the best AYCE sushi In town but I won't refer anyone here anymore. Service obviously sucks (or I should say getting worse? The server here never smiled) and food quality is getting worse. They don't even care how to roll rice anymore. Oh yeah, the server was trying to charge me for rice I left on the plate....I understand the rule but come on, your rice sucks and bigger than the sushi...trust me, I did my best and no bitch I'm not paying for the leftover. Lychee sorbet is good tho lol
I'm usually a regular here but I have noticed that the service has been slipping now that they are getting more popular. Food is good like it always is but it took a really long time to come out. . . Our server also didn't seem like he cared to be there. We had to try to get workers attention when we needed refills, wanted to order more, get the check, and to even have our payment taken. Pretty much everything that a server is supposed to do for us. . . Disappointed because we come here a lot. Now thinking that we need to find another spot.
This is my favorite spot for AYCE but today I am very disappointed.  Found HAIR in my food TWICE today. This is not acceptable. Plus customer service is wack today as well. I showed the waitress hair I found TWICE so she knew about it then she jokingly asked me "is everything okay? No more hair?" WTF kind of a joke is that? Ugh.
AYCE Sushi!  Let's do it! I'm probably still considered a newbie when it comes to sushi determining what is good and what is great.  From a newbie standpoint, this is great! . . We met up with some friends to dine on their delicious creations.  Since it was AYCE, I was going to take full advantage and try a variety off the menu. It was busy but there were open seats at the bar for immediate seating.  When you sit there, the waitress will handle sides and drinks.  All you have to do it tell the sushi chef's what you'd like. It was pretty great!  They were so quick on our orders and just fun watching them. . . I ordered half rolls of the Baked 428, Pete's, Sexy Girl and Frying Jason. The 428 is baked with grilled chicken spread with yum yum sauce, cream cheese, eel sauce and spicy sauce.  Love Love Love this!  I would have been happy with just ordering this.  Can't stop there! Pete's is deep fried sushi with white fish, crab, cream cheese, avocado and eel sauce.  The light texture enveloping this masterpiece from being deep fried made me fall in love with this roll.   Sexy Girl was filled with shrimp tempura, crab and cucumber.  It was then topped with tempura crumb and a spicy garlic sauce which made it totally SEXY! Frying Jason is a baked roll filled with crab, cream cheese, asparagus and avocado topped with spicy yum yum sauce.  Yum Yum indeed!!  I absolutely loved everything I ordered.  . . I am definitely a fan and will tell anyone who is in the mood for sushi to go here.  Fabulous friends + Fabulous food = Happiness!. . Yelp Challenge 2014 (150/365)
Me and the wifey met up with Bethany E and her hubby Mike for lunch on a Sunday just right after they opened which was 12 pm. Already the place was packed and we were told that the wait was an hour. So we were given the option to sit at the bar. I thought it was better way for we got superb service in getting our rolls because the chefs were literally right in front of us.. . We opted for the AYCE ($21.95) lunch option which was from 11:45 am to 6 pm. According to the menu, you had 45 minutes to alotted time to do the AYCE which didnt make sense because we were there for at least an hour.. . What is good to mention is that most of the rolls you can get you have the option of getting a half (4 pieces) or full (8 pieces) roll. I strongly recommend that you get the half rolls so that you have more chances of trying more rolls. Some rolls are only available as a full (refer to menu for they clearly state which ones are not available for half orders). . . As for what I ordered. Man, I will only tell the names but not describe them because this review would go on forever! That's what's good about doing the ayce option because you can try just about everything!. . What I got for starters were the Garlic Edamame, Fried Calamari, Ahi Poke, and Shrimp Tempura. Then, we got half orders of the Taylor Roll, Sexy Girl, and Frying Jason, Then full rolls only for the Spider Roll and Pixie Roll. We also tried one order (2 pieces) of the Seared Ahi. Lastly, we finished it up with 2 pieces of Strawberry Mochi.. . Originally, we wanted a table so we can all hang out much more comfortably while we ate, but after sitting at the bar, I think we got our orders much faster for the chefs actually hand you your order instead of your server grabbing it and bringing it out to your table. If you are at the bar, the servers are mainly there to get your drinks, appetizers, and dessert. . . Overall, I think that this will be the measuring stick to other sushi places that I will be trying out. The only negative thing that might deserve a mention is the wait time. But after eating here, I can understand why it can be a long wait for they serve good stuff  and the overall size of the place is not that big. Shout outs to Bethany E and her hubby Mike for inviting us to lunch! You guys are awesome!. . Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #135 "Go Go Goyemon!"
The bf and I always come here during lunch (while my son is in school) and occasionally for dinner. We love this place. The server know us as regulars. I would say this place is hands down, best AYCE sushi joint. They do half order for rolls, they don't limit the desserts, and the service is great!
Really decent all you can eat. Lunch is for $21 and you can get half portions on most rolls so you can try a bunch of things. . . I've been here 2 times and service was good the first time, but the secondtime, we were a little concerned because the quote is 45 minutes but the service was dragging and we were thinking they would cut us off directly at time. . . I do appreciate how not ever roll is covered in sauce. Even though some rolls were overly complicated, the fish was able to speak for itself in most instances.
Came back again, as always and actually had the same server who definitely upped his game! Must've had a bad day, way to go Goyemon... :]. . Happy Panda
