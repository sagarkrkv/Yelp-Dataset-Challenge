Saw a girl get fingered at this club on a Friday night.. . Just realized that by noting this trashy event on here might draw some people to make an effort to visit this club.. . Well, that was my very last time going to that club.  So disgusting and none of the security guards bothered to say anything.  Probably enjoying the view.. . Water:  they don't provide tap water at the bars.  You can order bottles of water though, but they will charge you $9 each for 350ml Fiji ones.  I think this part is absolutely ridiculous.. I wouldn't mind this high price tag, if they at least kept trashy porn action outside the club!
This place is amazing! Bring lots of girls and you will be hooked up. I came with 15 girls and we got free bottle service all night and a private table. All the security are friendly. Defiantly recommend stoping by here
Seriously? Girls, think 2x before coming here. Yes what the other reviewers said "Do yourself a favor and just go to XS" . . Depending on the event at the hotel, the place will conform. If it's a fight weekend expect to see ghetto ass people and rowdy people. The place was jam packed and not nice as the other clubs. We went on a fight weekend and the place was filthy, dirty, and gross. Lots of ghetto people (and cheap!) Not a place you want to be at. After the fight we heard many fights broke out (luckily we were at XS! Woot!). . Also, they don't do specials like other clubs like girls free drink from 10-11 or 2 free drink coupons, and they don't even serve water, you have to BUY a small small Fuji water for $9. No water in a regular glass? That sounds like a bad situation since that will lead to over consumption and by over drinking you get a rowdy crowd and then John Taffer will come and yell at you for letting your guest over drink. I know they want to make money, but with the expensive drinks, is a cup of water that hard to ask for? What if you're friend is totally wasted and that cup of water will save her life, and you just wasted all your money buying their expensive drink. Other clubs will provide you like a plastic cup of water, nope not Hakkasan because they want you to be drunk and rowdy, ghetto and get into fights. I guess it's publicity for them. . . Reeally people, do yourself a favor-go to one of the BETTER clubs (XS, Tao, Marquee, etc). You're welcome or I told you so.... hahaha.
Went here to "see" Tiesto on Friday night after landing in Vegas. Here's what I know:. . 1) I have one sole picture of me dancing with 3 random girls, quite provocatively.. 2) My credit card showed a $51 charge to HAKKASAN LV LLC. . So, 3 stars? One per girl in the photo.. . Everything else that happened is anybody's guess.
Gave hakkasan another try and glad I did. Unlike last time I came didn't wait at all. Walked right in and we had a table on the second floor facing the DJ booth. . . Had an incredible time and I do have to say that it's awesome that tiesto is the resident DJ. He gives an incredible show.
the only thing this place has going for it is the awesome list of VIPs that perform at the venue (tiesto, calvin harris, dada life) but otherwise.. i don't know why else i keep falling for the trap to go back! super crowded.. horrible set up for getting in with ridiculous waits sometimes even with bottle service and the help of a host. the hip hop floor was a lot of fun but way too crowded without any dancing space. 2 of the 3 times i've been to hakkasan was with bottle service which is kinda a must if you want space to dance but good luck getting it in the area with the music you enjoy! XS is the way to go hands down for a better all around clubbing experience.
This is definitely one crazy club. It was rated one of the top night clubs and I can see why. The place is pretty big, its always poppin but drinks are very expensive so make sure you pre game hard. Tiesto came on exactly when they said he would which I was super surprised about as well
The only good thing about this place is their DJs.. . After we finished dinner at Joel Robuchon which is also in MGM, a promoter offered us to get on the guest list for Hakkasan. Since Tiesto was playing that night, we decided to check out the club. The club is on the 4th and 5th floor. DJ is playing on the 4th, there is also the dance floor and tables. Stay on the 4th if you want to check out the DJ but no table because there is not a single spot with a view of the stage besides the table area.. . I personally like XS a lot more because of the open area, especially for a non-smoker like myself cos it could get really stuffy and smoky in a close area like Hakkasan. Another suggestion is unless you get a table in Hakkasan, you won't enjoy it as much because there are not many spots where you can check out the DJ.. . I like the layout as well as the crowd in XS more.
This place didn't cost $100 mil for nothing, it is out of this world. Some of the best talent in the world and beat staff in the world. For sure is the best nightclub in Vegas (with Light, XS, and Marquee being very close). The VIP Hosts are amazing and VERRY attentive. The bottle service girls are top of the line, never really had an empty drink. The lighting system is out of this world and state of the art. You just feel like a million bucks right when you walk in this place. A must if you're in Vegas
First time here and came here for my cousin's 21st birthday weekend.  We had a group of 6 guys and we were smart to get tickets presale.  Looking at the line for general admission was hella long and I would have been pissed if it was us in that line.  Reminds me of the time I waited in line for Marquee and not even getting in lol not ever happening again.  Anyways we arrived there around 10:30pm-11pm and went straight to the presale line and were in the club within 10 minutes.  We took the elevator upstairs since that's what the majority of people were doing.  I'm not really sure what floor we went to but ended up where Tiesto was supposed to spin at.  Headed to the bar to the left of us and then headed straight to the dance floor in front of the DJ that was spinning at the time.  Guess you can say it's an arena style setup.  The sound system in here is top notch.  Lights were really good too.  Everything synced up well.  Even the free Tiesto wrist bands.  Music pretty much got me pumped all night without having too many drinks.  We did pre-game before heading here but I didn't drink that much since I was the DD.  Tiesto's set was really great that night.  I usually can't listen to too much of his stuff but it was on point.  Later on went up and to the other bar on the other end.  Not sure what else they had since I was mostly dancing the whole night.  I think there was another floor up but looked like it was just bottle service areas like they had behind the dance floor on the DJ level.  Not a dull moment that night. Oh yeah and my cousin got some action from 2 ladies...or was it 3.
This nightclub is way over hyped. I just keep going back because they have the best DJs perform (Tiesto, Calvin Harris, etc). The club itself is way too small. By midnight on a weekend, you will not be able to move at all.
The food and service in this one is MUCH better than the one in Beverly Hills... The club is great too if a little overcrowded. Def coming back!
I was not a fan of this club. It was over crowded (worse than any other I've been to in Vegas), the staff was rude, everything seemed disorganized, the drinks were over priced (and tiny). I just don't understand what the hype is all about. . . I went here for a bachelorette party with a group of girls and a few of the girls were knocked over and hurt in the crowd. Security didn't seem to care, and a friend almost was trampled. I get it, Vegas clubs are busy and crowded, but this was outta control. They must have been breaking some fire codes or something.... . Won't be going back again.
Ok, so admittedly this night was a "once in a lifetime" thing for us.  We were eating at the restaurant and started chatting with the table next  to us. We all hit it off and they invited us to their table at the nightclub. It was right next to the DJ booth on the main floor, and we danced and drank all night! The staff was awesome, and the music was great. We will be back again, but probably not at a table. Unless we can find people to split with. Awesome night, great club!
I'm not sure how to rate this place... . Got in for free.. . Guest list goes through two lines.. . Tip: get there before 11, 10 isn't a bad idea, I didn't go through a crazy wait. (for guest list at least). My friend said she waited 3 hours one time and didn't get in, not sure why anyone would wait that long but yeah.. Second line: id check & stamped, and then guest-list check & stamp and then you go to a window booth thing inside (like a movie theater). . Experience is just weird, you get in, go into elevators and so on.. . . What to expect: classier than the LIGHT nightclub in terms of outfits (not all, but not so much of leggings and crop-top kind of place, guys were more well-dressed.. . Atmosphere: I like it more than LIGHT, but in terms of music I might of liked LIGHT more, I wasn't too fond of it here. It's EDM, but I didn't feel like it was great.. . BUT. . Theres a HIP-HOP floor, it's downstairs! I loved it! Some people had mixed feelings: some songs were great, some were bad.. . It's less crowded down there than for the EDM floor, a bit more intimate in a way though. . . ----. . CREEP FACTOR (not in regards to the club, but attendees):. . Just for that night for me, I didn't have to deal with anything like in LIGHT, felt like the guys were nicer in a way, not entirely. . . I really liked the hip-hop floor we met a random girl and there were these guys and we're all dancing together  in a way (but not on each other.. so that's cool).. . But there were guys arguing on the EDM floor if they knew us and random stuff.. DUDE, you're trying too hard.. I don't get guys.. They weren't touchy freely, but they didn't leave us alone..  . . There will still be drunken bimbos everywhere you go though, not classy.. spilling your drinks and stuff... . ----. . Bar:. . I only got one drink: lemon drop shooter (cheaper than the martini), I felt like the bartender.. she can't make drinks.. just my thought. . . Tip:. . Bar upstairs(still EDM floor) is less crowded that the first floor (EDM).. . Bathrooms:. . have a lot of 'specials' in there, perfume, lotion and stuff.. interesting..
Let me put this part up front because I feel it might be one of the most important parts of the review...you will not be allowed to sit ANYWHERE unless you or someone you know gets ridiculously expensive bottle service.  I actually saw at least one security guard who full time job it appeared to be to keep the peasants from sitting on a fairly low shelf in the corner of one room.... . They claim to be one of the biggest night clubs in the world, so I was expecting a huge dance floor and a cool electronic vibe like i remember from "The Wave" in Honolulu -- not even close I know people with houses that have bigger party rooms than the main or secondary dance floor.. . Also given the tiny dance areas you couldn't design a worse "traffic flow" if you tried, it's impossible to get anywhere, because people that want to dance have to do it in main traffic ways and within a few feet of the bars and bathrooms.. . Beyond that they open at 10 and the main artist isn't on until 1:30 -- but despite a massive number of leather couches everywhere, you're literally not allowed to sit ANYWHERE unless you buy bottle service, which is ungodly expensive -- I do mean anywhere, if you don't get bottle service you will stand the whole time.. . It was $80 something to get in the door and a single beer was $10, want a water? $9 for what anyone would consider a half bottle.  I bet I would have enjoyed this place if I'd have had $1k to drop on an evening, but then again I can think of a lot more fun stuff to do with $1k in Vegas.
I was there on 5/16 which was a Thursday and after reading some reviews on here I was hesitant to give it shot. First I would like to say its Vegas, most places don't have a table or chair or anything else to sit on unless you buy bottle service. This is  the case in just about any club you go to in Vegas. Second, yes drinks are expensive as they are in any place on the strip or any clubs. . . For the atmosphere, it definitely gets crowded this club is more of a venue imo to see top DJ's. If you are trying to go somewhere to dance than this isn't the place for you. If you are going to see your favorite DJ and just want to jump up and down and such than this is your spot. I would definitely recommend getting there early and buying pre-sale tickets as you will get right in. The line ques were already long at 10:30 vs the presale line which my wife and I were ushered right in. My only complaint is the main act NERVO didnt show up til about 2:00am which is pretty late imo. All in all had a great time and would visit again.
This was supposed to be Las Vegas' latest and greatest club... I thoroughly enjoyed the sound and the vibe of the House floor, but it was so crowded that you couldn't dance let alone stand anywhere without it being shoulder to shoulder. We opt to say in the Hip Hop area that was equally as crowded, but luckily we found a small corner to dance in. After a while, we got even luckier as a girl invited us to dance in her table reserve area and Warren G performed. Being West Coast girls my group knew all the songs and had a great time watching his show. We left immediately after because it was just too packed for us.. . Don't buy bottled water b/c the small bottle costs $9 talk about rip off.
Came here to see DJ Tiesto. Tickets on a Sunday night was so much cheaper for guys than on a Friday night  ($30 vs $75). Compared to Marquee, this place is a lot smaller. Although they have 2 rooms (hip hop on bottom and edm on top), it is still not enough to fit the amount of people who are here to see these world renowned DJ's. Common, if you're building a new club in Vegas, you have to build it big. . . Furthermore, there isn't even an outdoor area here. Although I did have a good time, it would be much better if the club was bigger.
My cousins and I went here for my birthday in February 2014. All I have to say its pretty big with the 5 Levels. I just did not like the place though, For one its way too crowded which I know Las Vegas clubs cant get crowded but this place is uncomfortable crowded, second the 5 levels makes it very easy to lose someone, and lastly its overrated. . . Overall I wouldn't come here, Ill stick to other clubs.. . Tip for the Ladies prepare to walk A LOT of stairs!!! If you want to get around the levels.
AMAZING venue, well minus the hundreds of stairs, staff was actually pretty nice, didn't have those macho bouncers with ego problems and small weiner issues so that was a plus+. . however the biggest downfall is that it is WAYYYYYYYYY too packed, feels like a damn zoo in here! you can't even move on the dancefloor so it really ruins the great atmosphere that this club COULD provide. honestly if you like this place, splurge the money to get bottle service, I will probably never be coming here again without bottle service.. . but... like I said great venue, lots of screens, good sound quality, pretty good eye candy (I can only speak as a guy though) but I'm sure I was great eye candy for the girls there too ;)
I came here with a bunch of my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday and had a great time!! I consider myself somewhat of a club connoisseur and Hakkasan was among my favorites.  Of course, as any club-goer knows, an epic night is made up of a host of factors coming into play, so take my five-star rating of the club itself with a grain of salt.  . . We arrived around 11pm with advance tickets for Calvin Harris and the line was really long, but moved quickly.  The venue itself is massive...it's a bit confusing to navigate the various levels, but we walked straight onto the main/EDM level and were overwhelmed by the crowd.  After making our way to the bar, paying for a round of overpriced drinks (expected of any club in Vegas, so can't really deduct stars for it), and making our way to the dance floor, my friends and I decided to find the hip-hop room.  . . One flight down lay a less crowded and exponentially more fun venue.  My friends and I pretty much camped out in the hip hop room for the rest of the night, and  didn't even mind missing Calvin Harris upstairs.  The music was on point (a mix of current stuff and throwbacks), and the crowd was great - not as many skeevy guys as in NY, but  we still got the right amount of attention that we all secretly crave (don't lie, you know you like it).   The set up was also great, with these platforms for girls to dance on (lots of fun!), and the bar separated from the dance floor for easy access.  The hip hop room closes before the main room, bc it emptied out around 3am (I think?  Who knows what time it was).  . . In short, great music, great crowd, and def a great time.
Came on Memorial Day weekend and saw Hardwell and to my amazement again nothing but superior treatment. Yes we did spend a bit but it seemed like the vibe was happening and met people all around that were there to have a great time. To my amazement Fergie spun a great set before Hardwell came on.
I came here on my first night in Vegas on 5 de Mayo weekend. It was a Friday and Tiesto was playing. We got invited to a table on the very top floor with an amazing view for Tiesto. We partied and danced all night and I absolutely loved the VIP experience. I will definitely be coming back to check out more of their resident DJs. I had so much fun.
Betty N.'s Bachelorette Bash Night 1: Hakkasan for Calvin Harris.. . Let's just say you can easily get lost here. There's mysterious elevators that take you from one level to the next. Totally confusing. . . Okay, so like I said, we came here for Calvin Harris. When he finally did show up in the EDM room...it was literally a mosh pit. That was a HUGE no thanks for me. I prefer to be able to shake my booty and wiggle wiggle myself without smashing my tatas or other body parts into other people or have them smash into me.. . We ended up hanging out downstairs in the Hip Hop room the rest of the night at this VIP table full of super friendly doctors. If it wasn't for the ROOMY Hip Hop room, I probably would have given this nightclub a lower rating.. . Recap of that weekend on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFd8kfiZIJY&list=UU5YaBtOxOYqeFEEQ_aW6JiA
fuq this place.. . No one I personally knowhas ever had a good time here. But when 30/30 people say it sucks, it really does suck. No outliers here. Nothing special here. Even my friends who got tables and bottles didn't enjoy it.. . Completely ruined my Vegas experience and weekend.
The bait and switch, I've been a victim too many times in Vegas and this place is no exception. I was ok with the $55 cover, since it included Calvin Harris and the Weeknd, but closer to the front of the line, cover doubled. F*CK ME. I swallowed and walked in with my hands around my ankles. It's a very douchey place, and I don't say that casually, just really wrapped up in it's self importance. It was packed beyond any 3rd world safety codes. The volume is way too loud, bring ear foamies. The first Dj was amateur, with on the fly tempo adjustment. He seemed to be practicing. The second DJ reminded me of the clown on the Simpsons, really animated but not that great. Calvin Harris however, a real professional, he brought it, and his hit Summer was really the highlight. The floor below had the Weeknd, unfortunately he only felt like going through a few songs at at around 1AM, but it's more fun on that floor, you'll actually be able to move and gasp: dance a little. Go with thick skin and thick ear plugs. Oh and shitty shoes, your feet will be like fruit rollups at the end of the night.
We came here for my birthday, on a Thursday night, at 11pm. The resident DJ Vice was headlining (he was ok, I couldn't really get into most of the hip hop music that was playing- and I like hip hop). We also used freevegasclubpasses.com to get on the free guest list. . . I don't understand the point of being on a guest list if it means that we all have to wait in the same 1 hour line, I mean getting in for free is great and all, but we even stood in line next to a couple who actually bought will call tickets online. Don't even think about pre drinking, by the time you get inside the club your buzz is definitely killed, the line was insanely long.. . By the time we got in there we were stamped 2 different times. Why is one stamp not enough? Not even sure. The bouncers and ushers were not friendly at all, they corralled us like livestock and didn't acknowledge us when we asked a question.. . The layout was extra confusing and extremely dark. It was a cluster #%^* inside. They packed that club to the brim. It was insanely overcrowded, it was definitely a hazard. You're not allowed to stand anywhere for a long period of time. There was no room to stand or walk. We kept getting ushered out of the way everywhere we would try to walk to, it was really exhausting and annoying! One usher forced us to go up the stairs and when we got up there another usher yelled at us to go back down. When we got back down there, the same usher tried to get us to go back up! Worst organization and club management ever! Expect to be touched and pushed constantly. . . 2 vodka tonics was $45! It's a complete and total robbery. Also, you can smoke anywhere in the club, but ecigs are 100% banned in the club... we thought that was interesting. . . The never ending stairs was the worst part of this club. It's 4 long flights of stairs to exit the club and also stairs scattered throughout the club. It's very exhausting in platform heels and not to mention, I also fell hard on my bum since it was very slippery from someone spilling their drink. Ugh...my bum is now super bruised! . . We had a better experience and evening at Tao, yes it's not super new like the hakkasan but at least our experience there was top notch.
I have been to lots of nightclubs in Vegas and I am afraid to say that this is the worst of all. I visited this club last weekend (Memorial Day) and had one of my worst experiences. I am giving a list of pros and cons below.. Cons:. Smallest dance floor.. Bouncers are super rude.. 80% of the club space is for table bookings.. You won't get a glass of water at the bar.. The clubs only interest is to make money.. You cannot sit anywhere for even 2 sec.. The clubs only intention is to extract as much money they can from you.. 50% of the girls you see in there are employed by hakkasan.. I paid 145$ to get in there and came out in an hour.. Pros:(only one). Tiesto. . . Seriously I you want a Vegas nightclub experience, never visit hakkasan. The only star is for Tiesto.
If this club wasn't overly packed I would give it 5 stars. Maybe I shouldn't have chose Tiesto to see on my Bday. Club has 3 different stages I believe (i think they're each on a different floor), I only went to one so i couldn't say what the others are like. But the way I looked at it was...if everyone there was there for EDM and not Hip Hop how can you have room for all those bodies on one for?? Felt dicks on my back all night. Not cool. I had to check the club out being all the hype it has been having. Will i go back? Most likely not.
Not the best club, I understand its new but they don't have the flow down like other clubs. Drinks are way overpriced,  they literally have a vodka and rebull in their hotel MGM grand for 8 dollars but here its $21! I can get better tasting AMFs and hurricanes at marquee for $15. They play the same monotone house music when I was there, literally left after 30mins.
I was in Vegas on Cinco de Mayo weekend for a bachelorette party. We came here on a Saturday night because someone in our group had a friend who had a table here. That night, there also happened to be a boxing fight therefore, MGM was very packed. . . There was a huge line for the club. Usually, if you have a group that's mostly girls, you can get put on the guest list, but we still were in a VERY long line. If you are not on the guest list, you can pay cover fee to get into the club (this fee usually runs $40+). We were in line for over an hour before we got in. The club is pretty huge. The main floor is all dancing but it gets pretty packed and crowded. We ventured onto another floor which had a completely different vibe. Overall, the experience was fun because of the company. We definitely didn't explore the entire area but I would come here again!
