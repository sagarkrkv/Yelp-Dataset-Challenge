There is not much negative I can say about my stay at the trump. We were there for 4 nights. We arrived at close to noon and the drive way was a little hectic. It seems they have no order to it. The workers try to maintain a flow but with the cabs, shuttle, valet, people checking out etc. It was crazy that one day. The rest of my stay the driveway was fine. As soon as we pull up. We were welcomed and asked if we needed anything. Our room wasn't ready yet. They checked us in and called us around 2 when it was. "No early check in fee". One more slight negative was that I paid extra for a strip view on the 42nd floor. We could see the top of all the hotels but that pesky treasure island blocked the strip mostly. . . Now to the good stuff. This is most definitely a different type of Vegas hotel. If you're looking for the chaos of a casino, clubs, restaurants and other elements of the strip around you at all times then this is not the place for you. I thoroughly enjoyed escaping back to our room after the commotion of the strip. With no casino full of smoke and games. We were out of valet to our rooms in about a minute with the express elevators. the room was very modern and comfortable. Sub zero fridge that froze everything because I mistakenly turned it up. A double stove with microwave oven over. We used all of that. The view through the floor-to-ceiling windows was breathtaking day and night. The bed was so comfortable I didn't want to lay in it until I was ready for fear that it would put me to sleep. the huge his and hers closets held all of pur belongings with space above for our suitcases. Ample cabinet and drawer space. We requested plates and utensils. They give you water and Starbucks coffee daily. No power black out curtains. The bathroom is where they went all in. The huge "quietly" jetted tub. The shower big enough for 4 people. The his and hers sinks with a huge mirror with built in tv was innovative to me. The enclosed toilet gave privacy. The pool was all that was needed. Padded beach chairs, day beds and a couple cabanas for rent. It was never crowded and the wait staff was there but never overbearing. This hotel was perfect for me. Glamorous but not over the top. Right accross the street for a Nordstroms. Close to industrial ave so we could get around quickly without getting stuck in the strip traffic. The rooms have a door bell and buttons to call for house keeping and "do not disturb". All of the wait staff went the extra step to take care of us. From the valet to the bell staff to the front desk to pool staff to house keeping. . . Yes there was a train but it was never a nuisance. My call service was fine but we did have to use the WiFi.  would most definitely stay here again.
This was our second time staying at trump. The hotel is cheap, close to the strip and clean. I did order room service for one breakfast since there was no space in the dinning area. The food was disgusting. The other days I went out. You could hear the train the entire time. It is annoying when you are trying to sleep and the train passes. Also we got an item that we purchased taken from our room which they kept saying oh we can't say for sure if someone took it. It was missing after the house keeping left. Also I asked them to change the sheets on the bed but they never changed them. I won't be staying there anymore. They also charge a 25 dollars resort fee per day which can add up if you are staying several nights.
I had an excellent stay at the Trump for my one day in Vegas. Although the Trump is at the end of the Strip (Near the Wynn), it was not that far off. Located across from the Fashion Island mall, this hotel is the the definition of classic elegance. . . My friends and I arrived in Vegas around 11am. Although check-in did not begin till 3pm. We tried our luck with the front desk and was notified that a room was not ready. We left a number and ventured across the street to the mall.. . When our room was ready (30 minutes later), the 1 bedroom Strip View suite was perfect for the 4 of us. Having two bathrooms in the suite made getting ready less hectic. The main bathroom in the bedroom was spacious and the tub looked amazing! For 4 girls, there was not enough countertop space. Unlike The Palms Place, you have to request cookware/kitchenware from room service. It did take about 15 - 20 minutes to receive the items. Also, I thought it was kind of the front desk to call to see if we receive the items requested. Cell reception was a major problem. My friends and I had terrible reception on the 51st floor, and we had T-mobile and Verizon.. . This hotel is valet only. When I left this Sunday morning, I didn't have a problem with waiting too long for my car. However, I did leave at 7am.. . Overall, this is a great hotel if you're looking for calm and nice retreat from the strip. I say it is an affordable hotel and greatly accommodates large groups. From now on, I believe my Vegas days will be spent at the Trump Hotel. . . Resort Fee: $28/day (besides the usual, this fee includes two small water bottles/day in your room). I spent $253.00 with taxes for one night. I was in Vegas during Cinco De Mayo weekend and there were two big fights this past weekend. So the prices were higher. Normally you can stay at the Trump for less!
Now this is what a suite should look like! I took my mom & sisters to Vegas over the weekend for my mom's birthday. We each got a suite ranging from the 49th floor to the 59th floor. Needless to say our views were nothing but breathtaking. The suites were gigantic in size - dare I say, bigger than my apartment/condo! Each suite has a full kitchen, living room, an actual bedROOM, massive master bathroom, and another full bath outside. You read that right, two FULL baths! In the master bathroom - which could've double as a ball room; seriously, you can hold a dance in there as it's very spacious - there's a his and hers sink (are there any other kind of sinks?), a tub with a large window overlooking the strip, and a shower stand that could've fit a party of four (it is vegas after all)!. . There are a few minor issues (albeit trivial) I had with the room, such as: bedroom door slamming continuously whenever the AC was on, old fashioned curtains that wouldn't close properly leaving the bright sunlight to shine through, and lastly, the dim lighting. The windows are darkly tinted and the light fixtures are opaque enough to drown out the lights, giving off a yellow hue. Ladies, it's difficult putting on your makeup when there's an instagram-style filter in the room. Thankfully these issues are so trivial that it's not enough for me to knock off a full point from this review. . . The price was reasonable despite a huge boxing fight going on that weekend so it should be very affordable off-season. If you don't mind the absence of a casino (or buffet) in your hotel then you'd be in for a luxurious treat at the Trump. Who knew the guy with a bad hairdo/hairpiece has great style in design and decor?. . At the end of our stay, my mom felt like a queen in her king size bed, and this princess was very pleased as well.
We stayed at Trump for 4 nights.  When we arrived, we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite with a view of the strip.   Staff was very friendly.  Hotel was very clean and well kept.  Pool area didn't have enough lounge chairs, but otherwise was great.  Food around the pool was ok--definitely nothing special.   Ordered the sliders and they were too salty.  Drinks were good though.   The DJT restaurant offered good breakfast but service was slow as molasses.   No casino on the property,  but I don't gamble so that was actually a plus.  However those looking for a casino will have to take a cab to one of the other casinos or take the free shuttle to Wynn or Ceasars Palace.   Overall Trump offers solid value, clean rooms and great overall service.  I would return here.
If you want to be awakened by the blaring horn of a freight train after a long night of Vegas fun, the Trump Tower is the place for you! It happened to me two mornings in a row - Saturday and Sunday.  Additionally, the food is mediocre, as is the service from the staff. The design of the entrance to my room, isn't well though-out, either -- it is a large double door, opening into a marble floored foyer type area that is shared by the room next door. Therefore, every time the neighbors come and go, the slamming of the doors echoes through the entrance area and could wale the dead. The pool area is crowded. All-in-all, this has been quite an underwhelming experience, and I will not be back. Donald, YOU'RE FIRED!
I Would Not Come Back Here.. . here why:. My friends and I were here to celebrate graduation for the weekend. Brittney at the counter kindly checked us in and said they will be taking $1000 for the deposit and made me sign a sheet saying that "we won't go crazy." Well, we didn't. . . However, before  checking out I noticed a charge for $250 of 'smoking fee' and I naturally complained while checking out to tell them I wasn't notified of any non-smoking regulations or fees. An employee told me that they were specifically trained to focus on the non-smoking part and mentioning a non-refundable $250 fee. I told her I spoke with Brittney who didn't mention of this rule and told her I needed to see the form I signed. When she came back, the paper had the non-smoking part circled, which I definitely don't remember when I checked-in. Soon, the manager came to tell me that he was the one who circled and admitted that he had the employee lie on behalf of him. Surprisingly, I didn't get the smoking fee refunded and MOREOVER, the manager spoke to me in a threatening tone, asking if I was using other substances besides tobacco. Uhm, Excuse ME? I was paying $1,500 to stay in your penthouse for the weekend and I do not expect for me and my friends to be accused of engaging in illegal activities just because I was smoking cigarettes. . . Regardless of the clean 5-star hotel look and the chill housekeeping staff (that I tipped a lot) this hotel should NOT be getting any customers who are planning a "Las Vegas" experience. Please do reconsider.
4 stars at best when I stayed here 5/14-5/17 but I did have a nice stay here once I got used to the flow of things.  There is no chaos that comes with a casino + hotel.  If I was going to return to Vegas next month, this hotel will be one of my top choices.. . THE MAJOR PLUS OF THIS PLACE IS THE PROPERTY IS STRICTLY NON-SMOKING.. . When you sign the terms and conditions, it clearly states the hotel will charge you a $250 refresh fee if you smoke in the rooms.  Whether this is pointed out or not, this is the major reason to stay at this hotel if you are a non-smoker like me.. . If you book on Hotwire like I did, you do not get Trump credits but one of the benefits about the property highlighted is that it is SMOKE-FREE.  If you book at the Trump website, it states the rooms are large and non-smoking.. . For those that cannot understand this, the only thing I have to say is DUH.. . Check in was quick and friendly.  My room was not ready so I waited in the lobby for about 15 minutes while the current rooms queued up were going through inspection.. . After I got my keys, I went up to the 32nd floor and noticed your room is door is actually behind one big doors.  You open the big door with your key card and see 2 more doors.  One of them is your room.  I would say this is a plus because you are insulated from the noisy people walking the halls.  Negative about this is that if the other room is occupied, you could potentially hear their door slamming but for me, it was empty.. . My room was missing a robe.  The MANDATORY resort fee here was $25 per day.  It includes free coffee pods, 2 bottle of waters a day, electronic access to magazines or newspapers on your iPad, and WI-FI or internet (no limit on devices).. . The gym is ok and closes late.  For a business traveler, it is a good place to get some rest.. . The room has a refrigerator (empty) that you can use for free [Venetian/Palazzo, take note].  Plus a stove and microwave.. . The beds were comfortable but I did notice some things that prevented me from rating this property 5 stars:. . 1.  Layer of dust under the toaster. 2.  Light socket in lamp is broken. 3.  Shades are manual, not electronic. 4.  Freight train horn in the morning. 5.  Sink and tub not cleaned to my standards. . The rooms have a large bathroom, with jacuzzi style tub, double sinks, and large shower.  Plenty of space to store your clothes and there is a safe in the room.. . Parking is valet only but you can park across the street at the Fashion Show Mall in the garage by Nordstroms.  There is a free shuttle to the Wynn/Encore.  I was able to get in and out of the hotel real quickly.  This is a big plus.  It didn't matter if I was crossing the street to the garage or walking to the strip.. . The major plus of this property is that it is NON-SMOKING.  I don't understand why some people will go into a room that is smoke-free and light up.  Do you know that you stink up the room for the next person?. . Elmer M, you are FIRED!
beautiful hotel and no casino (no smoking at all). rooms were very large and comfy. fabulous bathroom with jets in deep tub. $25 resort fee and the outdoor pool closes at 8pm (not sure why as there isn't a lifeguard anyway and many guests would love the pool at night). valet only parking but it is included so you just have to tip. right across from the fashion mall and easy walk to the strip. WiFi included.
Another GREAT stay at the Trump.  Love it there!  Everyone treated us AWESOME!  Food and drinks excellent value when compared to the strip hotels!. . Adjacent to one of the BEST shopping malls!  Love the no smoking no casino atmosphere!. . Already planning our next stay at the TRUMP!!!!
When we booked this hotel for our Las Vegas vacation I was a bit worried about the location.  It wasn't far at all from the strip!  We walked to the strip every day.  The rooms are amazing.  Very comfortable, clean, and you didn't have the musty hotel room scent.  We booked a spa day at their spa on premises and it was amazing!  That was money well spent.  Their on site restaurant was gourmet all the way.  We felt like royalty!  I would visit the Trump International Hotel again and again.
This was my second time back at Trump and it surpassed my expectations once again. Although I think this hotel would be more in line with 4.5 stars, my personal experience this stay was worthy of a 5. . . From the moment we arrived, we were treated as VIP guests (which as poor graduate students we are not). There was a short line of people waiting to check-in (5-7) which I was perfectly fine with when out of nowhere came a hotel employee who offered to check us in at the VIP counter around the corner. (Who were we to deny his request? Ha.) While checking-in, we asked for available upgrades; for a $50 upgrade fee, he put us in a strip-facing 60th floor giant 1-bedroom (2 full baths) suite with full kitchen, living room/dining room. Did we need all of that space? Obviously not. But boy was it nice to have. Moral of the story: ASK for an upgrade and swing for it, too. . . Common complaints about this hotel (with rebuttals):. (1) Far from the strip: Lies. It's approximately a 3-5 minute walk to Wynn and Encore down the street. PLUS, there is a free shuttle to the Wynn, Encore, and Caesar's Palace that leaves every 10 minutes and runs until midnight. . (2) No casino in the hotel: Is this really a complaint? There are a gabillion (a really large number) casinos in Vegas. Don't you want to come back to a quiet smoke-free sanctuary away from all the hussle and noise of any casino right down the street? Yes. Yes you do.. (3) Resort fees: ALL Vegas hotels have resort fees. . . My complaints:. (1) The bar closes early and service at the bar could be improved. . . My compliments:. (1) FREE shuttle that runs until midnight; Use this. . (2) Great lounge chairs by the pool. (3) Fast, efficient valet service built into the resort fee. (4) Wonderful staff; I was walking to the elevator and remembered I needed some  extra drinking glasses in my room; when I approached a maid with her cart, she said that would be no problem. When I tried to tell her my room number, she said she already knew it. Impressive.. (5) Substantially cheaper than all other 5-Star strip hotels regardless of who you book through
What a disappointment!  I expected much more for the rates and the name.  No casino, which normally would be fine, but not even a nice restaurant.  The hotel has one restaurant which nobody visits.  My girlfriend and I attempted to eat at it prior to going to a show, and could not even finish our meal.  The halibut was over seasoned and the noodles tasted as though they came from a Lipton food pack.  My girlfriends filet was greasy and difficult to stomach - neither of us finished our meal.  The only positive thing I have to say about this hotel is that the service is excellent.  For the money, pick another spot!
I used hotwire to get this hotel at a pretty good price. Originally, I wouldn't stay at the Trump. The pros: It is a suite. The Cons: valet parking only and no casino in hotel. . . We stayed 2 days:. With no fancy car, we were treated a little differently that it didn't feel welcoming. I tried to tip at least $5 for valet. With valet, I only used them twice. We walked the strip most of the time to avoid dealing with their valet process that made us uncomfortable. . . If only their valet treated us the same as everyone else, then it would have felt relaxing. I see it as business. You do your job no matter the person of dress attire or status. Your beliefs stay at home. Your job is service and customer happiness.  However, I didn't feel it here.
Trump Hotel should be a 3 star hotel....Bad customer service; Torn sheets in my room!!. . Pro:. 1.  Good bathroom and room amenities. 2. No Casino. . Cons:. 1. Staff cant handle busy days well. 2. You might find bed sheets with holes in them (its supposed to be a 5 star hotel). 3. Noisy (you can hear sound from the pool or the Train even though you are on the top 5 floors). 4. Staff not trained to handle customer complaints properly. . 5. No Casino. 6. Near the railway line. . The reason I chose Trump was that I expected it to be quieter, since it was away from the strip, alas I was so wrong. The train honks early in the morning everyday. The horn was loud enough to wake me up. I am light sleeper, but if you are sleeping at a 5 star hotel, on one of the top 5 floors you don't expect to hear outside noise.. . The main thing that disappointed me was their customer service. When I complained regarding the same to their staff, the lady at the front desk told me that they could not move me since they were at capacity. Shetried to prove to me that I was far away from the railway line and that I should not be hearing the train nor the pool music at all. She acted unapologetic and condescending and offered to send over ear plugs; couldn't stop stressing that they were going to be free of cost like she was doing me a big favor. Funny thing after all that, the ear plugs were never delivered.. . Icing on the cake was that next day I realized there were holes in my bed sheets. I even had the housekeeping clean my room after the first day use. This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel. How can you send torn sheets to my room!!!
I stayed here this past Memorial Day Weekend with my friends, and I would give this hotel a 5 star review if it weren't for the horrible service received at the pool.  When my friends and I arrived, we got there a few hours before check-in (which is fine) and we decided to kill time by going to the pool and enjoying some food and drinks.  We checked our bags with the concierge service (HUGE plus!), and made our way to the pool.  When we got there, we noticed there was a free cabana that nobody was sitting at (not even a towel was on it), and we inquired about what we needed to do to rent it.  The young lady proceeded to let us know that it's a $50 minimum in order to rent them (not a big deal at all), but that there were people previously on it and she wasn't sure if they were coming back or not since the rental fee gets you the cabana for the whole day (which doesn't make sense to me because they're missing out on opportunities to make money).  She then told us we can sit our stuff down on it and wait a little while to see if the people came back, and in the mean time she was going to talk to her manager.  After about 35 minutes, a couple walks in (I was able to see this because we were sitting right on the edge of the pool by where they came in) and they were inquiring about the cabanas.  Make a longer story short- the girl came over and told us we had to move our stuff because the people came back, when in reality they weren't ever there because I heard the conversation!  We took our stuff and moved to where there were four reclining chairs and set-up there, only not to be seen by a server for nearly 40 min!  When we finally got to order, it took another 20-25 minutes for our drinks to come out!  The rest of the staff was great, and more than helpful- but that pool staff definitely can learn a thing or two from others within in the facility.  My friends and I aren't confrontational, and we're not ones to make a scene lucky for them, because if we were there would've been a big scene made Saturday.  Other than that, the rooms were really nice and spacious- and the beds were super comfy!. . TIP:  book through the hotel directly and you will be guaranteed late check-out!. . CONS:  pool service, valet only (and if you don't tip they get smart with the usual "i appreciate it" line) which was inconvenient at times when I didn't have cash or just needed to run inside for a few.. . PROS:  quick service when you call the front desk for things, good food reasonably priced, free luggage storage, no casino which makes it a more relaxing stay and not smokey, just off the main strip so there's not as much commotion outside the hotel, spacious rooms, tv in the bathroom!
Great hotel without any of the fake themed decorations you'll find on the other hotels on the strip.  Off the strip but you can actually get there faster than a regular casino hotel, as you don't have to walk 2 miles through gaming rooms to get out.  Minimal line to get a taxi or shuttle.  . . Small pool but pretty chill. Service a little slow in the pool area.
The Trump was a nice hotel, but I'm not sure it was worth the price. First of all, you're in Vegas and you're there to play; it was extremely disappointing to learn that there was no casino in the hotel. What? Trump hotel just off strip and no casino?!? That was a big miss - I wouldn't have booked the place directly, but it's what we ended up getting via Priceline bidding. Anyway, so they have these shuttles to the Wynn and Ceasers to try to make up for it. It works pretty well during the day. The ride to the Wynn is super fast. It's literally a block away on a quiet street. The thing is, the shuttles don't run too late - well relative to Vegas-time.. . The lady at the front desk when we checked in wasn't very pleasant. She did a heavy up-sell job on room upgrades. We ended up keeping the room we booked. I noticed it's a trend at these Vegas hotels, but there was this additional $25/night resort fee we had to pay, which wasn't included in our original reservation. I wasn't completely surprised because I stayed a couple nights in another nearby hotel for a couple of nights before this one and they had it as well.. . The room itself ended up being fine. It was spacious and had some nice features, like a TV in the bathroom mirror (not like that was practically useful). It was fine and the housekeepers were liberal with the bottled water, which was much appreciated.. . I wouldn't stay at the hotel again, because you're paying near the high-end of the spectrum in terms of price, but you aren't getting the full Vegas experience without the  casino and so forth. I'm assuming they're trying to get approved for that as well, but I guess Trump should've played more nicely with Wynn in Atlantic City. Anyway, that's what we heard was the reason for not gettingapproval for doing a casino.
