This hotel is a huge property and don't realize till you get inside and settle in the rooms.  Service is excellent, the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Considering that this property opened in 1999, it's in pretty good shape.  You may see here and there some wear and tear, but nothing that is noticeable at least in our room.  Several details that are noted:. . * They filter their water and that makes a big difference, you can actually lather in the shower!. . * Views are very good if you have a room facing the Strip, hopefully on is available when you check in. . * Rates could get pricey, especially during their busy season starting in April/May.  We were fortunate to get $189/night for the weekend (Convention Rate), that is considered cheap.. . * My only compliant is that the beds and pillows are soft, they should replace them.. . Otherwise, I recommend this hotel, but expect to pay $$$$
The room was really pretty.......linens were nice...bathroom was beautiful.. Disappointments were outweighing the good parts though.. While checking in the clerk told us that we could have complimentary late checkout=1pm! We were super excited as we wanted to sleep in! Housekeeping was banging on doors and asking to clean at 8am! We wanted to go to breakfast but I had a weird feeling about the late check out. The front desk said we must be out at 11am because they are booked! What a total bummer, but she did say we can keep our keys and use the pool. We shoved our stuff quickly into bags, took them to the car, and ate breakfast at Ri Ra. We went to the pool (beach) and were happy to sit for a while. While reentering the building three was another huge surprise. As we neared the gift shop it looked like a lady in front of us was slipping and nearly falling down. As this happened, I realized that I had also stepped into a large pile of human feces on the marble floors! It was all over the place! Really?!?!?!?! I nearly vomited. I sent Mark into the gift shop to have them call for help. I waited there trying to help people avoid the mess and trying to not make a larger mess of myself. When I finally got an employee who could radio for help he told me to take off my shoe and go wash it in the restroom. Gross! I realize that the hotel didn't poop on the floor, but this was absolutely nasty. The saving grace was a sweet little old lady in the restroom. She had several of us lined up while she sprayed disinfectant and scrubbed our shoes with a scrubber! (That woman should get a medal!) I was shocked that it took so long to get anyone to come help, and further shocked that not one employee came to check on all of the guests who had such a crappy experience! I did call customer service, but I felt it was condescending for them to just say they will pass this on to management, no one should have had to take their shoes off when they didn't  want to. Ughhhh! L. uckily, only our feelings were hurt.
The hotel is average of what you can find in Vegas. I was expecting a lot more.. . Rooms are simple with no decor. . . The hotel have several restaurants and activities. We did the shark aquarium.. . The pools are fantastic and if I was rating only the pool I would give them one more star. However the hotel itself doesn't deserve more than 3.. . Other hotels in the area but way better than Mandalay are: Palm Palace, Palms, MGM, Signature even the rooms of the Luxor hotel are better than this.
Stayed one Saturday night for about $280 + the per person per day resort fee. They put us in the room below the nightclub on the top floor and claimed the noise would stop by 12:30 - it did not stop until past 3 am. We asked for a discount and were refused. I cant rate any hotel above one star if we can't get to sleep from noise caused by the hotel itself.. . I did notice that a short walk through the inside casino/mall gets you to the Luxor Hotel - which is much cheaper and less crowded.
Stayed here twice now for extended weekend trips to Vegas and haven't been disappointed.. . The rooms are spacious and the hotel is very accommodating (within reason).. . We usually venture off for food but the pools are great and everything is kept quite clean.. . It's our go-to.
Stayed here for a long weekend getaway. Arrived on Fri at 3:15 pm. Hardly any line to check in. The lady at check in was very nice and offered a suite with Strip view. Really, the best view I've ever seen! 2 Queen Beds. Everything was fairly clean. Used the pool and lazy river. They were checking any bags, backpacks etc at the pool entrance but spared us since we were going in with our 4 year old kid. You can only buy the inner tube for the lazy river at $18. We used it twice during our stay so I guess that is worth it. We were out and about all Sat morning and returned to our room at 1 pm. only to find our room was not cleaned. Disappointment When we woke up from the nap, I had to call the front desk who transferred me a few times. Finally upon request the cleaning lady came by in 10 mins. She was very nice. So i guess tat made up for it. We ate at 2 different restaurants:. 1 Noodle Cafe: Slow but friendly service. Chow mein noodles were salty; Fried rice had no flavor. Will not eat here again. 2 Border Grill: Awesome gourmet food and great service. Def try their Mojitos, Plantainempanadas and Avocado tacos.. . We checked out using our phone so that was a breeze. Casino area is nice and not as smokey.  Overall will visit and stay at mandalay bay again.
I was eager to finally check out this hotel. I've heard great things from friends about this hotel and I booked deluxe room. A few days after I booked the room, I got an email from Mandalay offering to upgrade my room for an extra $15. I quickly agreed as the Great Room suite seemed much better for the price.. . However, upon arrival I was told that I could not have a smoking room. They told me it was something that they try to accommodate, but is not required. I told them I would have never of agreed to an upgrade had I known they wouldn't be able to give me a smoking room. They brought over an manager to explain further that if I wanted a smoking room, I would have to pay for an upgrade again. The manager, Kristin, who we spoke with regarding our room didn't care one bit about our situation and lacked empathy. . . Instead of this, I opted to downgrade to the room I originally asked for. Upon arriving in the room, the bathroom was dirty and full of pubic hairs.  I called down to guest services and asked for an extra ice bucket. For an extra ice bucket, it's $5 each. No other rooms were available and we were stuck with a pubic filled bathroom.. . Valet was pretty bad too with long wait times and I had to load my own luggage in my car since there not enough bell hops on staff.. . The customer service at this hotel is absolutely horrendous. I will never, ever stay at this hotel again. The staff at this hotel did their best to try to ruin my weekend in Las Vegas and I would not recommend this place to anyone. . . tldr; Mandalay bay is dirty and the staff don't have customer service skill sets.
Yes I'm a fan of this resort always clean always needs an one of my favorite clubs in Vegas is here which is called light make sure you stop by and check it out also another pub would be called the red square which is also a A great place to catch a few cocktails before dinner are a show or whatever you have on your agenda to do for the night our day, Hotel is still not showing much where at all yet did you keep up on that cleanliness and upkeep of the hotel very good the pool is also very nice and have a nightclub in the middle of the location called I Candy which is also kind interesting but the major club would be light that is the name of it just the light come check that out rooms in service are always clean housekeeping does a great job ballet great job in the attitude is great in this hotel bye for now I will update next week when I return,
Love this hotel. Nice spa, huge wave pool, and good sized lazy river. They have a fair number of specialty restaurants inside like Flure, and Citizens. We didn't care for the food at Citizens but I'll leave that to another review.. . Rooms are a good size and decorated well. Overall a very nice hotel and casino.
Stayed here for a quick 2 day birthday trip. Resort was nice, room was pretty nice, paid the $20 for early check in, pool was awesome! . . The only thing that brought this trip down a big notch was the rowdy, loud, drunk group of people in the room next to us on our last night. We turned in around 1 am to be awoken around 230 by a loud drunk screaming laughing girl and several others. Finally around 330 we called security to have a chat with them. . . Even after security asked them to quiet down (and i think kicked out one person) they left and came back still drunker and louder after 5 am. In my opinion, noise complaints after 3 am should have been handled much more sternly. After tossing and turning all night we could not wait to check out and get some peace and quiet.
Worst customer service ever!!! Jason, the 'manager' has no skills at actually running a hotel or dealing with his employees. And his excuse? 'There are too many employees' I'm currently staying here and they've called twice to check on something a guest before us forgot. Well didn't the maids clean???? And the first time, when we checked the whole room and said we couldn't find it, wasn't that enough??? So, rude. Jason--- get some customer service skills. Or a new job!!!!!
Great restaurants, spa, salons, and the humongous beach area. Best pools! I didn't care for the loud music (huge concert at the beach area).
HD EXPO IS AWESOME! [: . . Their convention space at Mandalay Bay is incredibly spacious and just superb.
I always stay here when I come into vegas. It's so gorgeous and clean. I love love LOVE the pool. Bartenders and servers at pool are awesome! Super friendly check-in staff also. Cleaning ladies are pretty obnoxious about cleaning your room as early as possible and didn't come back when we asked to come back later. I mean, come on, how early do you really expect me to go to bed in VEGAS?!?! Haha but it wasn't a big deal. Always enjoy my stay!
facility-wise, there are worse places on the strip. service-wise? this has been THE WORST HOTEL I've stayed at in recent memory. at check-in I was given a late check out if 1 pm. at 11a I went down and dropped $80 on breakfast in the hotel (cheap for this place, but still). went back to my room at 1230 to find that my keys had been turned off. security had to let me in so I could get my stuff out. . . great way to end a vacation, right??. . the security guard tells me to call the front desk and ask for a supervisor. and then that person's supervisor. and so forth. so, I call. and get disconnected 3x, only to be told that Trey (the 'supervisor') is busy. so I go to the front desk, where instead of getting an apology, I get some lame excuse about how easy it is to demagnetize the keys. um... let's put aside the fact that I've stayed at places better and worse than Mandalay bay, none of which had such fragile keycards. instead, let's talk about best practices in customer service. I'm pretty sure that 'blaming the customer' is not among them. . . in short, this place is lame. it's overpriced and not worth the poor customer service. I dropped tons of cash on the promise of getting a vacation. and am instead going home upset. thanks a lot, Mandalay Bay.
24 hours later... still waiting for a call back from some manager named 'trey.' can't get anyone on the phone. and they overcharged me $200+ after I left the hotel with no explanation. THIS PLACE IS A JOKE. GUARD YOUR WALLETS. I'm reporting them to the better business bureau and to my credit card company.
This hotel has always been one of my favorites since back in the days. I have stayed here numerous times whether it's been at the Hotel or a 1700 sq foot suite last year during Labor Day weekend at the Mandalay itself. I made a reservation for Memorial Day weekend and this time I am with my family and kids and they absolutely love it. The cabanas were priced right and the hospitality is spot on at the hotel itself. And not to mention they have the best club in Vegas The Light. Definitely a place for everyone as I partied here as well as spent quality time with the family.
I've been in this hotel many times. This place is much easier to get to than some if the other hotels as it sets at the extreme south end of the strip.. . Plenty of parking here. They also have a great concert venue at this hotel.
It's 1:30 in the morning. I desperately want to sleep. The bed is comfy. The pillows are the appropriate level of fluffiness. The room is dark. Now if only I could turn off the music coming from Daylight - the outdoor beach club which spins until 3am on Sunday nights! On the 28th floor, with ear plugs and white noise blasting from my iPhone I could still hear the bass echoing in my room. When my husband called the front desk the not so helpful staff shared that "it doesn't bother some people. " . . So, if you are one of those people I totally recommend Mandalay Bay. However, if you like the idea of a quick afternoon nap (music also thuds all afternoon) so you can power through the night or might want to crash before 3am on a Sunday - MB is NOT for you.
We have been at Mandalay before in both Mandalay and The Hotel. This time, May 12th 2014, we arrived and instead of Mandalay we received a room in The Hotel. Nothing wrong with that as we had a good stay last time. The second day, after shopping and lunch, we found our room not cleaned. After having contacted the reception this problem was solved later that afternoon. That same day, after having dinner, we could not get into our room. Our keycards were blocked. At the reception we received new keycards. Both Mandalay and The Hotel lost the glamour of the earlier days and our next visit to Las Vegas will not be in above mentioned hotels.
This review is for the casino and the pool as I have not stayed the night at the Mandalay Bay. . . For years, I assumed the Mandalay Bay was too far away from the main center of the strip. I was wrong. We recently stayed at the Luxor which is conveniently connected to Mandalay.. . POOL:. - The pool scene is vast and includes a wave pool and lazy river, both are worth the visit alone. My two minor complaints is that there were tons of kids everywhere (it was however Memorial Day weekend) and that the beers were astronomically expensive ($11 for 16oz Corona). . . CASINO:. -Loved it. Very open floor plan.
I'm a fan.  This is a pretty good Vegas resort.  Rooms are clean, as are the facilities in general.  Spacious with a decent setup.
I enjoyed my stay at Mandalay Bay. I especially liked the wave pool, room service food, and clean casino.. . I stayed at 2*1500 sweet, and it had two rooms. One room had one big bed and the other room had two small beds. The big bed was comfortable and relaxing, but the two small beds were not comfortable, and made it hard to fall asleep.. . What I especially did not like about my stay were towels in the bathrooms. They were not soft and contained lots of dust, so I didn't feel good using them.. . Overall, I liked the hotel, but I did not like the towels.
Went to a pool party there Sunday and ended up getting a room and staying the night. The room was huge and really nice. Didn't see much of the other parts of the hotel. The pool party was a blast. Nothing better than techno and drinking at a pool.
The hotel itself is beautiful. However - maybe it's because I work in hospitality... it really bothered me that when we walked into our hotel room the bed skirts were all wrinkled and sagging off the bed, the carpet had stains and the bathroom smelled musty and moldy. The pools were amazing but you cannot get a spot if you get up any later than 9. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant options in the hotel are fantastic. I would say that the hotel room was sub par but the rest of the hotel itself was great.
not near good enough for what you pay.. paid $400 for a basic room on a Sat night, plus the BS resort fee. Add in extra charges like cabana, and outrageous food bills and this comes close to being a total rip off. I've stayed at truly world class hotels that charge less.
