I thought this restaurant was just okay. My rating is based on the food vs price. The one thing I didn't like is that everything is a la carte. I ordered the Caesar salad which was good. It was pretty big and I didn't finish all of it. My husband ordered the basic hamburger. It was just okay, nothing special for the price with no sides. I would only dine here again if the other restaurants were too crowded.
Food was amazing and service outstanding. Diana R was the best service that my fiance and I have ever received in Vegas. Thanks for making the start of our night before our show so fabulous!
Very nice place, burgers are extremely good, so are the shakes too. Service is also very nice. If you're in Vegas, this is definitively a restaurant to go to.
Good tasting burger and never had one cooked so perfect. Also  a decent atmosphere. I did not get any fries with mine so I am assuming those cost extra for all you that need fries with your burger
Cool place! Good burger and excellent service.. I was pleased with my burger. Give it a shot u want be disappointed.
Great food and a casual atmosphere.. . The food is good.  I recommend the brisket nachos.  They are delicious.  . . There are lots of TV's and it is open to the hotel and casino floor.  Great place to grub.  I have never had to wait for a table there.
Flying into Vegas at night around dinner time can be a little challenging...strangely enough.  The last thing I want to do after checking in my hotel is go wandering around trying to find a decent place to eat after traveling, snacking, and sitting on a plane all day.  So, I always do my research in advance and low and behold I found that this place was open late as we were staying at the Mirage.. . Yes, there are places open late but finding a GOOD place open late is a challenge.. . I'm sure I've walked past this place many times as they have many higher end burger joints in Vegas so when we found it, of course it looked familiar.. . A little pricy, yes...however you get what you pay for and the quality of food here was great.  I really enjoyed it.  I didn't get a burger, I got a california chicken sandwich and ordered the draft beer & fries combo.  I can't recall the price offhand but coming from Chicago, the prices weren't unreasonable.  There were a lot of tasty looking shakes on the menu as well as adult shakes such as blue moon + sherbet.   Honestly, the menu was so amazing I wish I could have eaten here twice ... I will definitely keep this place in mind when I return to Vegas.. . They have a "to go" counter here as well.
I decided to give their salmon burger a try and it was by far the best  I have any where else by a long shot.. . I loved the tangy sauce, greens, avocados and tomatoes that went with a very tender salmon on a fresh onion roll.  If you like stronger flavors I think you will like this one very much.. . Sweet potato fries were obviously good, but not as good by the time I got my share of the last batch.  (barely warmand a little stale). . Service was great at the bar, good beer selection too.. . The hardest working people in the place are the cooks and people preparing the food.  They work behind the bar in a grill area where you can watch everything made and they were working their butts off to keep orders moving.  Impressive work.
Customer service is pretty terrible. The greeter was rude and the server was worse. "What do you want to eat" is not an appropriate way to introduce yourself as your  server. The food wasn't bad but definitely not worth it if you are going to be treated like a piece of shit.
The burger was really good, didnt like the fries but It was cool
Came here with my grandmother for a late night snack. We ordered the spinach dip which came to us in a hot little bowl but realized the dip was COLD. The waitress was kind enough to send it back to heat up. What we got back, I assume, was our same dip put into a different bowl since it was a smaller amount.. . I took a bite and it tasted bitter and barely warm. In all honesty the dip was terrible. It tasted like horseradish was put into it and mixed around. I stopped eating but my grandmother ate more.. . We finished and paid and went up to our room. In the elevator my grandmother said her stomach didn't feel well. Once we got into our room, she ended up vomiting for several munutes!! My stomach felt weird as well but I have a strong stomach. . . Whatever you do, do NOT order the spinach dip!
I thought this place was adequate for a midnight snack.  I had just got in to Vegas and checked in to my suite for a bachelor party and was famished.  After finding out that In-N-Out closed at 1.... we stopped by here for some late night eats.. . I can't help it, love onions and mushrooms on my burger.  I went with the Shaft's Blue, blue cheese, balsamic caramelized onion, and mushrooms and a strawberry shake.. . Both were solid,  I was lusting over my friend's simple Classic burger though.  Not that this place is bad at all, but in the day with many more options, would be surprised if I would come back.
I have been here several times.  I had the wagyu beef burger.  It was almost as good as the first time I ate this burger.  I ordered it medium rare.  It was served the right temperature, but for some reason it was not juicy.  It needed a bit more fat in the meat.  I also had onion rings.  Just excellent.  The star of the meal was the black and white milk shake.   Completely awesome!  Service was very quick and friendly.  This will not be my last visit.
