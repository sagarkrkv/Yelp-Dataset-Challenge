This was a quintessential Vegas experience, and I don't mean that in a good way. Unfortunately Gordon Ramsey isn't living up to all the hype surrounding his shows. . . My husband and I had Kobe beef slider appetizer, the ribeye with fingerling potatoes and the beef Wellington with a Sierra Nevada and a glass of wine to wash it all down. I think the best thing I had all night was the wine and the sliders. They added mustard seed to the buns for an interesting, intense flavor and the meat was juicy. The wine was $28 for the glass so I'm happy I liked it. The ribeye was just okay. Not what u would expect from a Michelin star restaurant. It was cooked to specification but not incredibly flavorful. In fact my husband had to ask for a side if salt and pepper in order to finish it. Not impressed for more than $50. My beef Wellington was also cooked to specification and flavorless. I needed a side of Dijon mustard to get it down. It was okay, but again, nothing memorable. For the price we paid I felt like I was in my own personal nightmare (no pun intended). The fingerling potato side was nice but certainly not worth the $12 price tag. . . All in all it was a typical Vegas experience. A lot of glam and glitz followed by an empty wallet and buyers remorse. The sooner I forget this experience the better.
Got the tasting menu and it was amazing. Everything from the warm delicious bread to the sticky toffy pudding was amazing. Hostesses and servers were on point all night rounding out this fantastic dining experience. While everything  on the menu was great the beef Wellington stood out as being some of the most tender and flavorful steak I have ever eaten.
For my birthday, my girlfriend took me here and boy was I a lucky man. We were seated in a comfortable booth with a pleasant view of the restaurant. Definitely fit the wining and dinning atmosphere. . . Our server was great and classy. He explained all the cuts and variety on aged beef. For our appetizer, we ordered the Maine lobster which was a small portion of stuffed chorizos with kale, lentils and cream sauce. It truly tasted magnificent! . . My main course was the Roasted Beef Wellington with potato puree and glazed vegetables..very delicious and worth the money. I wanted a Wellington ever since Hell's Kitchen started. Nothing like I ever tasted, just melts in my mouth. With every bite, I couldn't stop smiling. For the sides I had seasoned asparagus and bleu cheese Mac and Cheese, baked! I can't even begin to tell you what this tasted like. Simply amazing!. . For dessert I had the sticky toffee pudding, the pick of the year. Wow, my tastebuds exploded with such sweet flavors. . . Overall, the experience was great! Will definitely do this again.
WOW, WHAT A MEAL THIS WAS!. My friend and I came here with high expectations after reading the many yelp reviews and salivating at all the pictures of the food online. . . We made a reservation for 8:30 and only had to wait 5 minutes before we were promptly seated. Our server quickly introduced himself and the menu. Before we knew it, we came face-to-face with the  mesmerizing steak cart. As good as all the cuts of meat looked on the cart, my friend and I came here for one thing only: THE BEEF WELLINGTON!. . I ordered the single serving beef wellington and Mac & Cheese while my buddy ordered the single serving beef wellington and Chorizo stuffed Maine Lobster in brandied lobster cream sauce. Expect 45 minutes for them to make your beef wellington, as it must be cooked perfectly. While we waited, there was so much in the restaurant to look at. The wine bar, the cute hostesses, the gordon ramsay object in the ceiling and the kitchen. The whole presentation of the restaurant was just very welcoming and fancy hipster looking. Service was very good too, I feel unfortunate for the yelp-ers who complained about lack of service.. . grading of our food:. . Maine Lobster in cream sauce: A. Friend said it was good, but it wasn't anything you can't find in your local high end steakhouse. . . Mac & Cheese: B-. The texture and sauce of the dish was dry and didn't quite tantalize my palate. . . Beef Wellington: A+. Gordon Ramsay, you got me! Flake was crusty, the beef was . cooked perfectly and easy to cut. I loved the mash glaze and vegetables it accompanied with. By the time we finished half of the beef wellington, we were so full already.. . the bread: A+. I forget the names of these free bread plates they gave out, but they were phenomenal. I am pretty sure my friend and I went through 3 plates.. . By the time we finished our meal and paid our $180 bill, we were absolutely full. We struggled to walk out of Le Paris, onto the Las Vegas Blvd. My friend and I (both athletes) had to sit down on a bench for a few minutes to rest from that absolute beast of a meal. That's how good GR STEAk IS!. . My only quirk with GR Steak? This is a high end establishment, as least the prices certainly show...where are the white table cloths that usually accompany high end steakhouses?
I had extremely high expectations for the food.  I went with the Hell's Kitchen with no reservations and they sat me quickly which was great.  I ordered the pre fixe and wine paring.  I can honestly can say the food was absolutely fantastic and I couldn't have been more pleased with the Jessica the sommelier who was knowledgeable (as you would expect) but also had a great personality and smile.   Donnie who was my waiter orchestrated a wonderful experience and timed the food perfectly for me.  thanks Donnie..
I have avoided writing this review for some time because I'm worried it won't be good enough, perfect enough to explain just how good this restaurant is. I have to say up front that I an an unapologetic whore for Gordon Ramsay- I'm one of those people you will overhear at a cocktail party saying "Oh no the BRITISH kitchen nightmares is so much better...", I make all my friends watch The F Word on youtube, and probably have some weird form of Stockholm Syndrome for him. It's a lot of pressure to live up to- but now it's time to face my demon. . . This restaurant blew me away. BLOWN. I have been to super fancy expensive restaurants and I have been to high priced steak houses, but this is the first time at a steakhouse where they actually carried over all the snooty elements of fine dining and executed it perfectly with the steak theme. It's even inside the Paris- the most unjustifiable snooty casino on the strip!. . The restaurant itself is pretty cool inside- from the decor to the place-mats to the knives and forks- everything about it is sleek, fancy, and solid. This isn't an exaggeration, I actually considered purchasing the leather place mats they serve everything on (and it turns out they do in fact sell them). It's a little bit louder than you would expect at a rest of the world fine dining restaurant but actually quieter than the average Vegas restaurant full of wooo girls so try and control yourself while eating. . . The Staff- so fancy. I was dressed nice but the waiter outfits actually made me feel like a bit of a slob. The staff is great- I am a bit of a stickler on drink refills and I don't think my water glass ever got more than 2 sips down before someone swooped in to refill it- that's quality service. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the different kinds of meat, what ingredients were in the side dishes, and didn't even get visibly annoyed at the barrage of questions he was faced with. . . Ok onto the food. First of all- the bread is legit. They have a bacon/fig brioche that is preposterously good- make sure you order lots of extra as they may try and trick you by only bringing one for the table- everyone will want their own. . . The cocktails- I have had a few... That may or may not have influenced my positive review (trixy hobits). My favorites are the Side Car and the Drifter (they change this sometimes but all the bourbon drinks have been good- and helloooooo giant ice ball I can swish around in my glass for an air of faux sophistication. . As per steak list guidelines I always get bone in ribeye, potato side, mac and cheese- but there is a sub rule to this that many people don't know about and that is " if there is a pork belly appetizer- order it". . . Pork belly- hot damn this was good. It comes with cheesy grits and a tomato jam which sounds like waffle house (covered with ketchup) but I apologized in my head for that comparison the second I tasted it- its good. . . Ribeye- this was fantastic. It had an almost rock hard crust on the outside that was nice and salty. Despite this torched exterior the inside was a very dark pink/almost red color after being ordered medium rare. Even the outer edges /fat of the steak had been seared deliciously. It was incredible. And also it was served very hot, which is my preference. . . Mac and Cheese- nailed it. A lot of truffle mac and cheeses are basically garbage- its some fancy cheese that doesn't melt well with random bread on top and then doused in truffle oil. Not so here- all the flavors went together perfectly, and the mac had clearly spent actual time in an oven as not only was the top crust crispy but many of the noodles on top were also crunchy- something I like. . . Puree- yes this has CRAAAAIM FRAIIIIIICHE in it- and it is amazing. It is so smooth it almost boggles the mind. It is almost like a sauce- and yes you can dip your steak in it and it's incredible. . . Dessert. The first time I got a cheese cake and it was probably the best dessert I have ever had. Many cheese cakes come with a strawberry sauce on top of them- pretty standard. This one came with a strawberry sorbet on top - and the temperature and texture of that sorbet took cheese cake to a whole different level. . . The coffee- ORDER IT. It comes with 3 spoons that are a combination of chocolate and liquor for you to mix in. . . . In closing, haters gonna hate- if you really didn't enjoy this restaurant I assume you are some sort of comedic foil who exists just to troll the rest of tasteful humanity.

Just had my birthday dinner here and I have to say that I wasn't too impressed. My boyfriend and I arrived to the restaurant about thirty minutes early. The hostess' outside the restaurant were very friendly and escorted us into the restaurant. As we were seated, our waiter arrived and gave us an iPad. When I made a reservation at the restaurant, I let them know that it was for a birthday dinner. The waiter just asked who's birthday is it? And I said mine. He just looked at me and said oh happy birthday with no enthusiasm and stated that there were over 40 selections of beers to choose from and cocktails, and just left. After waiting over 15 minutes, our waiter comes by and takes our drink orders. . . We finally ordered our entrees and our waiter continued to have almost like a cocky attitude. Never smiled. Never said thank you. Never even asked if we had any questions about the menu. He just said are you ready? I ordered our appetizer and my entree and our waiter looked at my boyfriend and said 'and u, what are you ordering?' It almost felt as if he was talking down on him. . . We ordered the shrimp cocktail $19. Three jumbo shrimp in a refreshing sauce. The watermelon cubes complemented the dish well! I loved the little salt on the watermelon also. The salt enhances the watermelon flavor in a unique way. I ordered the braised short ribs $40. The meat was a little fatty, but flavor wise it was good. It could have a little more salt. The spinach that came with the dish was very salty though. My boyfriend got the filet $54. The filet was good, but we had better tasting filets. The meat was not as tender as we wished. Our sides we ordered were Mac n cheese $13 and brussel sprouts $12. Both the sides were delicious. The Mac n cheese has to be the winner tho! . . Flying from Hawaii to celebrate my 25th birthday here I was expecting a better experience. At the end of our meal, our waiter just dropped off the dessert menu and said our toffee cake is the best and rushed off. We ended up not getting dessert. No complementary dessert was even offered. I expected a place like this would offer something small for a birthday or anniversary celebration, but I guess not. The saying "Don't expect anything because you'll only be disappointed" was how I felt about this whole experience. . . Would not recommend this place. Food is good, but there are plenty of delicious places on the strip. Not a very romantic setting. Loud. Did not feel special. Waiter sucked.
Taste: 4. Creativity/Authenticity: 3. Atmosphere: 3. Service: 5. Bang for your buck: 3. . I literally ate steak back to back to try and find the best steak house in Vegas and well I think i may have found it. Now i'm writing this review after eating at the old home stead steak house at caesars palace; there are many factors and variables that both restaurants lack but i will go through each one and determine which is best. First SERVICE, GR is flawless, you take a sip of your water its refilled, you need a spoon its brought out to you at lightning speed. The waiters are on point, they know the menu inside and out, they know their steaks and explain it well to anyone who knows or doesn't know about meat. Now to the good part FOOD! to start I got the Demi Roasted Bone Marrow and Caesar Salad, the bone marrow yet very delicious; I would do without the mint sauce and stick with a more traditional bone marrow and cracker but still good. Next the caesar salad ehh nothing fancy 3 romain leaves with a GR version of caesar dressing with a battered fried quail egg; the sauce very rich and overpowering but i think the fried egg made the dish. Now to the main course got the American Rib Cap and the American filet with a side of Haricot Vert and Potato Puree. The meat is un describable you have to taste it yourself, all i can say it was some of the best meat i have ever eaten; perfectly cooked flavored to perfection tender and soft like butter! All the sides complimented the dish the haricot vert were fresh and crispy and the potato puree OMG i'm getting hungry writing this review. The atmosphere of this place is nice, dark and ominous but the thing that i didn't like about it is i had made reservations for me and my gf and when we were seated it was in a corner near the kitchen entrance not a very romantic location especially if your gonna make a reservations and spend top dollar for a romantic dinner so minus points. Now down to price i was expecting to spend for 2 especially when i ate at old homestead the night before for 1 but i was shocked and surprised that for what we got and the service i was pleased to say that if you want to take your wife girl friend out for a nice dinner this is the place!! I will be back
Everything was good here apart from the steak. . . Let me start off by saying that I loved the decor and the ambiance of this place.. The music was very hip and the "channel tunnel" look was a nice touch however I was not sure about the serving station which was sandwiched in amongst the rows of tables. I do not come to a restaurant so see my server cleaning plates and assembling knives. . . Anyway I had the onion soup as an appetizer. It was excellent however he bread was served by someone who could barely speak English. I am certainly not a xenophobe however there were some almost dangerous consequences as I did not understand the explanation that there was mushroom in the bread (which would have caused some serious health issues had I not caught it). Furthermore its just frustrating not being able to understand what has been presented in front of you.. . Anyway my biggest issue tonight was the steak. I ordered a ribeye. This is a fatty steak. I know this, however almost half my steak was gristle. It was a joke. What was worse I showed my server the plate half full of fat and he argued with me and basically told me I should have ordered another steak. I did not pay $300 on a meal for two for some snooty waiter to lecture me on the finer points of a cow. I got a bad cut of meat and rather than apologize the waiter turned it around and made it my problem.. . We ordered sticky toffee pudding and it was excellent. A must if you go to this place.. . Overall this place was ok but at $300 on a meal for two I expect it to perfect which it was not.
One of the best meals I have ever had in my life. Our dinner started off with a bread platter that had a variety of sweet, buttery, flaky, crunchy goodness. As an appetizer I ordered the British Chowder. It was just wonderful. The scallop and creamy broth were the highlight of that dish to me. Very balanced of salty and savory flavors. I followed with Gordon Ramsey's signature beef Wellington as my entree for the night. I can say that it tastes just as good as it looks on television. So juicy and tender that it felt like the meat melted in my mouth. We ended the night with the sticky toffee pudding with a decaf French press. So happy our waiters suggested the pairing, it was delicious and sweet without being heavy. The food is delicious and the service is AMAZING at this restaurant. If you're looking to treat yourself to a wonderful meal and an extraordinary experience I would highly recommend trying Steak and Paris Las Vegas. It will not disappoint!!!
Being huge Gordon Ramsey fans, my husband and I knew we had to go to one of the many restaurants he owns in Vegas. After viewing the menu, this was our choice. We were not disappointed. . . It was fate that the night we went, it was Hells Kitchen night, which featured a special menu and an autograph from Ramsey himself. It was a no-brainer, we went with the HK option. . . I'm a gin drinker and couldn't believe the assortment of gin cocktails they have. I opted for the English Garden and was beyond impressed-- so refreshing!  They also have an impressive craft beer selection which made my husband happy. The wine list was a mile long and also impressive. . . The meal was lovely. The main dish was Beef Wellington-- the best I ever had. The risotto and scallops were perfect. The award winning toffee pudding knocked my boots off-- OMG... Pure heaven. . . The waitstaff was attentive and friendly.  The decor and ambiance was fantastic. Even the music they played was good-- Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones, etc. What an all around, cool place. Great experience.
1st impression, very good bar service, good vibe.  Once seated all down hill. Our server was a putz, food was good but expected better. Mon ami Gabe is much better save your $.
I've been to GR restaurants in US & UK and there's a reason he's one of the best and produces that way. The menu is awesome. I finally got the beef Wellington and it was divine. The sticky toffee pudding - one of the best desserts in your life. There's a reason its award winning. The service was fantastic. Also had the bone marrow and we asked for bread and it came with real English muffins that were very rich but yummy. The lobster tail was ok. Definitely a fantastic meal. Just don't gamble in that casino. Deals are beyond rude.
The wife and I went to this restaurant and absolutely loved it.  The food was phenomenal and very satisfying.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and we are definitely going back as soon as we get back to Vegas.
Gordon Ramsey is a MUST on places to find when you come to Vegas.  Had the the  American Kobe Beef Filet, Alaskan King Crab legs and a bottle of Shiraz. This is our second time here and this place is PHENOMENAL!! The staff is very friendly and attentive. It's a must to splurge once in a while. Gordon Ramsey I want to have your love child!!
May be one of our best restaurant experiences ever.  Everything about it was 5 stars.  Let's start with the service... impeccable, attentive, friendly, polite.  At one point I asked for the restroom, and our server had his assistant escort me there.  The serving assistant would wipe, sweep, or clean any loose drop, bread crumb, or piece of food that happened to fall of my plate.  Really great service.  Even as we left, the hostess smiled and told me happy birthday again.  We've been in a lot of formal restaurants, but there was something about the service and the friendliness that made this a better experience.. . The food... starting with our appetizers.  The oysters and kind crab legs were fresh and presented in such as clean manner.  Legs were more or less de-shelled and sliced and then placed back on a half shell for presentation purposes.  Even the little cartilege spine you find down the middle sometimes was removed.  Oysters cleaned and shucked perfectly.  Both came with a variety of sauces and tobasco to your liking.  I'm not a fan of large oysters, but the smaller ones were sweet, juicy, and with a little taste of ocean in each bite.  Excellent, rich seafood appetizers that won't spoil your appetite.. . For our main courses, my wife's confit chicken was incredible.  I had a few bites of hers.  The chicken skin was removed and deep friend into a salty potato chip like thing.  Almost like a thin pork rind.  Ifyou are familiar with filipino lechon, the skin was like a thin chicharon.  I could eat these all day until I had a heart attack.  The chicken itself was juicy and tender.  My wife said that it was probably the best chicken dish she has ever had.  I, of course, got the famous Beef Wellington.  It was kind of a must try.  The first few bites were pretty amazing, but I have to admit that I kind of wanted just a pure, unadulterated steak at the end.  The beef was so soft and delicious, I started to feel like the liver and puff pastry were getting in the way.  It is still a must have, but next time I may try a wagyu ribeye or filet just to get the pure richness of a quality steak.. . Dessert was another must have.  The sticky toffee pudding is just excellent,  I've only had it once before when I was in London, and I remembered liking it back then too.  It is a rich, decadent dessert.  Like eating honey that was somehow made into a slice of cake.  I'm usually a chocolate fan, but this was really good and unusual to find in american restaurants.. . All together, my wife and I really enjoyed Steak.  Everything about it... the food, the service, the atmosphere were top notch.  It was pricey, but we both felt like it was money well spent.
Some of the best food I've ever eaten in my life. Make sure you make reservations or prepare wait for a seat in the bar area.
Gordon Ramsay may be hyped up on tv but his restaurant definitely lives up to it. The restaurant is location in the Paris Hotel right through the casino to the left. There's a huge pillar with his name on it and a cool lighted decorative awning at the entrance. The entire restaurant is beautiful full of simple colors, modern industrial feel and contemporary art. . . The hostess that lead us to our seat gave a brief introduction to the hotel and pointed out a big lighted red centerpiece of the restaurant that represented the motions Gordon makes while making his famous beef Wellington. . . The restaurant offers a cool set "Hell's Kitchen" 5-course menu for $145 that includes his famous beef Wellington, sticky toffee pudding and risotto (which is only available on this set meal). Unfortunately, the whole table has to do the HK menu for timing and not everyone was as hungry as me!. . The bread plate that came out was amazing with specialty breads such as lemon, cheese, truffle, bacon. Each had an amazing texture and I couldn't stop eating them! I ended up getting a beef Wellington with Brussel sprouts and truffle Mac n cheese as sides. Every item was done deliciously. The beef was incredibly tender and juicy. It was full of flavor and a quality meat. The portion size was healthy and I couldn't even finish all the delicious steak. All of the sides were also delicious. I don't even like Brussel sprouts and I couldn't get enough of them. The truffle flavor was strong in the Mac n cheese unlike some others I've tried and it was the perfect cheesiness. . . The sticky toffee pudding was delicious but a bit sweet. I was really more impressed with the brown butter ice cream that came on the side. It's simply not a flavor that I would've chosen off the bat but it went some perfectly with the toffee pudding! I couldn't eat much of this dessert because it was so rich and I was super stuffed already!. . Must come back and try that risotto!
Wife surprised me for my birthday with a trip to Vegas and a birthday dinner at Ramsey's.  We ordered the tasting menu and a rib cap. The quail egg was awesome.  Drinks were perfect.  Scallop risotto was to die for.  Also had the beef Wellington and shared the rib cap.  Both excellent to try but think I will stick with the ribeye.  Best of all was the sticky toffee pudding.  A must order.  Great experience for a long dinner and one time experience.  Made for a great birthday.
This was fantastic! By far the best dining experience I have ever had. I went with my parents and girlfriend while staying at Paris. Let me start off by saying our waiter Charles and his assistant John were amazing. Extremely knowledgable and definitely knew what they were talking about. We took Charles' recommendation for a bottle of wine, it was exactly what we wanted, and he described it perfectly! All of they steals we ordered were tender and full of flavor, best steak I have ever had by far (Wagyu Rib Cap). We also got the Long Bone Rib Eye and Wagyu Filet, all of which were amazing with no complaints whatsoever. Finished the night off with the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Let's just say it was a perfect dessert, and was the best I have ever had. Great Job Chef Ramsey! We will be back and will definitely be requesting Charles as a waiter again!
Amazing dinner. . Escape to Vegas with my men left us wanting hearty man food. . Who better than Ramsey to deliver? . Get the sides, Mac n cheese, creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes.. Steak cuts rib eye and NY strip to die for. Don't be late- they will hold it against u.
Wait staff was amazing. We had the Hell's Kitchen tasting menu. Every single thing I put in my mouth was pretty much amazing.  The food and service couldn't have been much better. . . Atmosphere definitely wasn't what we we're expecting. When you pay over 200 dollars on a meal, you wouldn't think the guy at the table next to you would be still wearing his shorts from the pool. . . My wife and I were expecting a fancy room for that price. We were way over dressed. Also was really loud. Kinda weird. It's worth a try to have the food. But probably never again.
amazing steak. best i've had. service was fantastic as well
Looking forward to dining here since it opened.. Very disappointed. . . Food wasn't bad, not good enough to bring us back. The sticky toffee pudding was the only thing I found unique & delicious. I had the beef Wellington & it was very undercooked.. Mac & cheese & steak my husband ordered was very good! . . Wait staff seemed too busy to actually pay attention to our table & everything we requested took extra time. . . Prices were about average for the type of restaurant. . . It was WAY too noisy to enjoy a meal. My husbands dad was with us & he couldn't hear a word the wait staff,or I, said so we pretty much didn't talk. . . Really bummed.
Simply outstanding.  Best steak I have ever eaten in my life!! Since I am a die hard Gordon Ramsay fan, I had to visit his steak house.  I had read mixed reviews but needed to see for myself.  The restaurant itself is in the Paris hotel, and is pretty chic.  Little things like high quality paper towels in the ladies room with the name of the restaurant imprinted make for a cooler experience.  Our server was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the menu and gave us a lecture on the menu that was accompanied by a very cool display of meats.  I learned a lot about meats and was able to see the ruby red colors due to the mirrors that showcased that top side of each cut for the whole table to see.  Interactive cocktail menu on the ipad was very cool as well.  The meal began with a nice selection of breads.  The one that stands out is the fig pinwheel...very yummy.  The Caesar salad was accompanied by a scottish egg.  The salad was crisp, the croutons were crunchy (not too crunchy so they cut your mouth), cheese was thinly sliced and the dressing was super fresh. Best Caesar salad ever.  Now, for the star.  The Beef wellington.  How can you not order this if you have seen his show!! It was AMAZING.  Fireworks amazing.  It just melted in my mouth. The temperature was perfect...it was just outrageously, sinfully perfect.  The potatoes and root vegetables on the dish were beautiful and tasty.  We ordered the truffle mac and cheese which was excellent, the asparagus which were pretty standard and the Brussel sprouts which screamed EAT ME! Don't STOP! They were seasoned eloquently and meaty in their texture and consistency.  Just a big fat YUM! Now, on to the most spectacular dessert! Sticky toffee pudding was to die for.  It was sexy on every level: plating, taste and sh-arability. The ice cream looks like a stick of butter and you can cut a piece for each piece of cake you eat.  All around this was a memorable experience in every way, and it helped I was with 5 of my dearest girlfriends and we shared everything (My friend that ordered the rib cap shared a bite and it was fantastic).  Kudos to Gordon for being able to dish out what he dishes out!!
If I could give 10 stars, I'd give 20. . . The dinners of all dinners and certainly number one on my top five dinners of all time.  . . DECOR: The restaurant has a very modern vibe, with a very comfortable atmosphere.  The London Underground entrance/bar is a very nice touch as well.  Perfect for a romantic dinner or a dinner with friends and family.  My boyfriend and I dined with my parents on our trip out there. . . EXPERIENCE: Make sure when you're coming here, you are here for the experience of it! That means, don't rush!!! Take your time, especially if you are getting the Beef Wellington, which was superb.  The waitstaff was super attentive and very charming, making jokes with us throughout the night and adding the overall wonderful experience. . . DRINKS: I had three...count them...three Pimm's Cups which is one of the signature drinks here (a huge drink in England).  They were to die for! I don't drink that often, but these would make me change my mind.  Its delicious, crisp, and super fresh, filled with fresh fruits and garnishes. Really great drink.  My mom got a dirty martini with stuffed olives, which she loves, and said it was really great.. . FOOD: Finally, the main event. Don't come here and plan to stick to your diet btw, this meal is for you to fully enjoy and savor.  The food right down to the bread they bring you before the meal was UH-MAZING.  I mean, Chef Ramsay gives you a choice of pancetta brioche on the plate.  That's right...BACON BREAD.  And its heavenly as you can imagine.  We got one appetizer: the oysters.  The oysters were perfectly fried and the presentationwas fantastic on the half shell.  . . Next, the entrees....I had the American Filet which is the Kobe style, and it was fork tender and seared perfectly to a medium rare.  The kicker was I added a half pound of Alaskan Snow Crab legs.  Holy Hell.  Talk about to die for.  They were poached in butter and cooked perfectly.  I have had my fair share of snow crab legs, but these were ridiculously good.  My boyfriend had the famous Beef Wellington, and it was worth the wait.  The signature dish Chef Ramsay totes, is succulent and cooked perfectly, and when you get a bite with all of the plate fixings its heavenly.  My mother got a regular filet and it also was fantastic and tender.  My Dad got a ribeye and again, the steak quality is phenomenal.  We also shared a bunch of sides: Mac and cheese, Mushrooms, and Fingerling potatoes.  The mac and cheese (coming from an addict) was good enough for me to fly from the East Coast to Vegas for one serving of it.  Yeah, order it.  The others were great too, nothing too special about the potatoes or mushrooms, but everything had a great taste profile.  . . Dessert was a whole other animal.  Sticky Toffee pudding with Brown Butter ice cream, the house specialty.  My mother is not a dessert person, but she still raves about this dessert.  The toffee cake is super moist and warm, especially when they pour the vat of toffee sauce over it.  Then you take a bite of the brown butter ice cream and sigh, because you can't even explain how good it is.  My boyfriend and I split this dessert because we had all had a lot of food so far, and he still to this day complains to me that he can't believe he had to share it with me and he wished he'd had his own.  What a baby, lol! But it really was that intoxicating.  . . Then a lovely surprise...my mother and I ordered coffee and besides your own french press, you get 6 chocolate/alcohol stirring spoons, two of each kind...for free! The selection was milk chocolate filled with Baileys, white chocolate filled with Amaretto, and dark chocolate filled with Chambord.  I thought that was a great touch, because they could have easily charged you good money for it.  . . All in all, the bill was outrageous, but we expected it and to be honest....it was freaking worth it.  It was the first thing we all raved about to people back home.  We had gone to Alize earlier in the trip and were completely unsatisfied with everything, especially the price.  I have no problem dropping money on a meal as fantastic as this one, believe me, and would happily do it again. How I hope to do it again, lol!. . So don't let the price keep you away, I promise you will be completely elated with the entire package at Gordon Ramsay's Steak.
Amazing. Amazing.  Amazing. Highly recommend it. We had top ranked waiter named Freddie. Manager had that restaurant running at 110%. You can not go wrong here. Food was AMAZING... From wine recommendations, appetizers, mouth watering steaks, to decadent desserts. Unbelievable!!
You'd think a place with Chef Gordon Ramsay's name would be overpriced and pretentious.  Well, you got one of them right!  . . Yeah sure price is high, but in Vegas it's money money money!  I felt perfectly comfortable walking in here and the service was top notch.  My buddy and I sat at the bar and ordered some drinks.  The bartender recommended the American Wagyu Cap Rib.  So we went for it and along with side of sauteed mushrooms and haricot vert.  Needless to say, the sauteed mushrooms was nice and warm to the palate with a slight sweet and garlic taste.  The haricot vert was pretty much tempura style.  The highlight of the night was the wagyu steak...ooo--weee!  The best bite of any steak I've ever taken!  Tender, juicy, and a hint of salt and spice...definitely a recommendation on my end and Bo Bites favorite. - Enjoy!
Went here with the hubs for our first anniversary. First of all, let me say that the food was AMAZING. I'd definitely recommend the beef Wellington to everyone! My experience here however was a little disappointing. Here is why:. . 1. The place was soooooo loud!! My voice does not carry well, so it was impossible for my husband and I to carry on a conversation. Not very romantic for an anniversary dinner. =(. . 2. We were seated REALLY close to other couples. I guess try not to go when it is busy, if that is ever possible. It was extremely awkward eating and trying not to listen to the other people talking around you.. . 3. I don't know if anyone else experienced this but, my husband and I were just generally uncomfortable the whole time we were there. This place tries to be too fancy in my opinion. There were like 3 different spoons on the table and I had no idea which one to use for my appetizer. We just wanted to stuff our faces, but we couldn't because the atmosphere felt too stiff.. . So, overall I would say go for the gimmicky experience and for the awesome food! But if you want a nice romantic dinner with your love then find a less crowded restaurant.
My husband and I were hoping for an amazing dining experience our last night in Vegas. Unfortunately Gordon Ramsay's Steakhouse missed the mark. Our waiter disappeared shortly after our cocktails were delivered (we did not see him again until our meal was over which was about an hour and 15 minutes later). We ordered the Welington, Boned in Ribeye, cream spinach and fingerling potatoes. The sides out shined our entrees. My husband favored the spinach and I the potatoes. For a 175 dollar meal + tips, 3 stars is being generous.
Ask for Will or Matthew... but all the staff here is awesome!! Really Good food but a bit on the pricey side. Ask for food recommendations from these two fine gentlemen if you're not sure about what to order. Beef Wellington was cooked to perfection. Especially loved the sticky toffee pudding at the end of the five course meal. We even got to meet head chef Christina from Hells Kitchen!!
We are huge GR fans and we were really excited to try this place, felt the girls at the front were snobby and cheap looking but I suppose they go with the vegas scene, the restaurant is beautiful and we had a great booth table which was a bit too big for us but comfy. The breads were amazing we asked for seconds! Our runner was so wonderful we wanted to tip him separately at the end but we couldn't find him, his name was Johnny and he was so friendly and answered all our obsessed fan questions about Gordon, we loved that guy! Our waiter Sean was also great, very professional, friendly and funny, service was tip notch. The food was also really good especially the creamed spinach side! It wasn't the best meal of my life and considering the price ($61 per main) I had to mark it a star down for that, my meat wasn't super tender and needed some knife work and considering the rip cap should be one of the best cuts, it didn't impress me. My husband's New York strip was actually better and more tender. Sticky toffee pudding was delicious as we expected so that is def recommended. Overall it was a great but expensive dining experience.
Gordan Ramsey Steak is a sexy, trendy dinning destination.  The music is loud, the hemlines are short, and the food is fantastic.. . The cocktail menu is full of hand-crafted libations.  Both the South Side and English Garden were fresh, well balanced and delicious.. . For appetizers, the Fried Blue Point Oysters had a light tempura batter and came with sea asparagus and creme fresh tartar sauce.. . The seared Foie Gras was perfection with hazel nuts, gooseberry reduction and goat cheese popovers.  If you like foie gras, this is a must order.. . For entrees, the Beef Wellington's 28-day dry aged fillet mignon was so tender and lovingly wrapped in layers of flavor. . . The bone-in dry aged Ribeye was again very tender, had a deep beefy flavor, and a charred crust from the intense searing.. . For sides, the Brussels Sprouts were charred and had the perfect acidic tang, and the Bone Marrow was silky and had rich flavor especially at the charred ends of the bone.. . And save room for coffee and dessert!  The Cappuccino is delicious and comes with 3 cordial spoons (Amaretto, Baileys, and Chambord) and the sweet Sticky Toffee Pudding with Browned Butter Ice Cream is worth over stuffing yourself for!. . Gordon Ramsey Steak is a great place to celebrate with friends when you're partying in style.  Thank you to our server Anthony and runner Alexis for an epic meal!
I was so looking forward to eating here. Let me first say, the food is AMAZING!!! Our service on the other hand wasn't.  It was our wedding anniversary. We weren't asked by the hostess if we were celebrating anything but we heard her ask the three she sat around us.  We ordered drinks from the bar but weren't offered the iPad drink menu like the other people around us. We weren't offered the Hells Kitchen Menu Tasting they were doing but the other people around us were. It was quite disheartening! The food and atmosphere was really nice.
I've been to plenty Michelin-starred restaurants that, while good, haven't been very memorable. However, the rib cap I had at Gordon Ramsay Steak is hands down the best steak I've ever had. It was buttery, flavorful and perfectly cooked.. . I also shared the Beef Wellington, as it's a Ramsay specialty. It didn't disappoint, but I'd rather have had the entire rib cap to myself.. . Everything else was great as well, but I have to mention once more how wonderful the rib cap was.
Awesome awesome food. The wines are pretty insane. I left wanting to come back again.
Best Restaurant in Vegas.... Maybe the whole world actually! (Bold statement but I feel it's warranted!). . We arrived around 8:20pm and there wasn't a table available for over an hour. As it was just the two of us, we decided to sit by the bar which is full service with no wait time. I would like to add that we tried to book a table earlier in the day but after being given the number to the casino, then the hotel, we gave up and decided to head on over once we were hungry. Anyway suffice to say if you would prefer a table I would definitely recommend booking, it was jam packed all night. (No wonder!!). . So to start.... The bar tender Oscar is bloody brilliant!!! Friendly, professional and very knowledgable. My husband had a beer and I got a custom made strawberry daiquiri with 1/3 alcohol because I really am a lightweight. . . This was hands down the most delicious, we'll made, perfectly balanced cocktail I have ever had in my life. I'm only 32 years old but my gosh, I have been waiting for a drink to love my whole life and now I have found it! The strawberry and lemon mixed beautifully with the gin and then the hint of basil brings it all together!! Seriously. Worth every penny and I kinda wish we could have an oscar clone in our house to teach us how to make perfect drinks!. . As we are perusing the menu some delightful breads came out... Still warm.. With a lovely butter. I'm British and my husband is American and our taste buds often differ but we were both delighted! The breads were absolutely divine and a lovely selection. . . We shared the pork belly to start - 10/10! I can really appreciate a well cooked pork belly and this was melt in the mouth delicious!  The onion and jam that was served with the pork was perfect. If you had seen us you would have seen the pure joy with every bite. This sounds like an exaggeration doesn't it? It's not. If anything there aren't the words to describe how wonderful it was! . . For the main meal I had the lamb duet and my husband had the beef Wellington, guess how they tasted? That's right yelp land. Bloody perfect! America doesn't offer enough lamb dishes if you ask me... Delighted to see that Gordon is offering a traditional British dish (shepherds pie & lamb chops) and taken them to the next level! . I'm confident the beef Wellington  was a delicious as my husband reports -- although my lamb was so good I didn't take a bite of his at all! . .  We ended out perfect meal with a cheese plate and a delightful sticky toffee pudding. Good on Gordon for adding such a staple British pudding to his menu and elevating it to such a high standard! We were audibly satisfied after the first bite - the ooh and ahh that we made during our meals showed the staff how amazed we were. . . My husband rounded off the meal with  johnnie walker blue label neat - and it was the perfect end to the perfect meal. . . What else? We have covered the food (to clarify: amazing, 10/10, delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned and presented) .... Let's go with the extras. . . Ambience: yes. It's dark and it's loud. Noticed that some other yelpers moaned about the music being too loud.... It is loud but I much prefer hearing some inoffensive music to the sound of other diners chatting! . . Staff: I would totally recommend sitting at the bar. I already mentioned how lovely and awesome Oscar is. There was also Tracy and Paul. Both as magnificent and polite and professional. What a quality team! They look clean and tidy and we'll presented (off topic but.... Tracy is beautiful with some wonderful eyebrows!!) they were attentive and not overbearing which is a very fine line being at the bar. I appreciated that they kept our water topped up. . . Restrooms: so clean and tidy. I also liked that I was shown to them when asked, rather than being pointed through the crowds. . . merchandise: there is a selection of items for sale, displayed very well in the wine rack. I have NEVER in my life bought a tshirt from a restaurant but I will be gladly adorning my Gordon tee, and if they had the red one in men's sizes, my husband would have too. . . Overall: I am pretty picky. I am hard to please. I turned to my husband half way through the meal and said - when have I ever loved every single thing about a meal? His reply? Never in your life. THATS right! never before have I been so impressed with a restaurant. We spent $350 and I would happily spend it again tomorrow if we weren't leaving! My husband is going to be away for a year and leaves at the beginning of June. This is our goodbye date in vegas and and this night absolutely made the trip. I am coming back to vegas in  a few weeks to meet with family from the UK and if they don't want to come, I will happily dine at the bar alone. It's that good! . . Excellent service. Excellent food. Value for money. Amazing amazing amazing! . . My husband and I are pretty big Gordon fans given that he is bloody brilliant! but now? He's pretty much our favorite ever!
I come to Las Vegas once a year for work.. I dined at this joint last year three times in a row and was mesmerized by it.. I went bck two nights ago and was very disappointed. The food had turned from amazing to average . The service is always impeccable and the manager was very nice to swap our order, but even the second choice it was still avarage.. I order steak tartare everywhere and nobody in Europe would ever ever serve ot with chips instead of toasted bread.. I think Gordon needs to come back soon!!!!!!
The wait staff were phenomenal. The food was ok. The Wellington (actually, the filet) was delicious. Melts in your mouth. The sticky pudding cake - in a word - YUM! (Very, very sweet though.). It was ok but I don't think it was worth the $400+ we paid for two. And, we left hungry. Not cool at all. It is unlikely I'd ever do a tasting menu again.
Very good surprise at this restaurant, came in to the restaurant on Saturday at 7pm and got a table right away, the staff was very nice and was right on with their recommendations. I got the American Kobe filet medium rare and my daughter got the  American Kobe rib cap well done and both done for perfection! Thx Jessica my daughter turn to me after the meal and said to me thank you that was the best steak ever!!! I agree!
