I really like this place.  The bars are all places to have fun with a loud crowd.  The casino is clean and the employees are nice.  What else can you ask for?
My boyfriend and I stay at different hotels at the strip about 2-3 times a year. I wanted to stay here because I love Gilley's!!!  I made the reservation for a deluxe strip view room. We arrived Saturday between 1-1:30 and checked in right away. Our room was on the 23rd floor and our view was awesome!! The pool was right below and you could see all the way down to Mandalay Bay from our window!!! The room was clean, the bed comfortable. Unfortunately, the sports book was being remodeled and while they set up a temporary sports book in the conference center for Kentucky Derby viewing, but we were more interested in watching the Kings/ Ducks game that evening!! Not a problem though, we went to Luxor to watch the game, since we had been there in the past to watch hockey games. And I am sure that when they finish there sports book remodel it will be spectacular!.  Now we want to give a special thanks to the security staff and Las Vegas paramedics for their awesome response to our unfortunate medical emergency! After returning from watching the game and drinking a lot of different alcoholic beverages, including a 32 ounce frozen Jagermiester and energy drink, a rapid heart rate called for the assistance of these individuals!!! They were completely professional and understanding and most importantly not judgemental or critizing. Thank you again for your quick response!!!
Well maybe 4 and a half stars. The place was pretty good We had a view of the pool but someone had scratched the shit out of the window so we couldent  see out very well. Kahunaville restaurant was great inside the casino they have 8.99 breakfast and two for one drink coupons. They also have outdoor seating by the pool! Senior frogs has open bar well drinks during the week for 25.00 from 10 to 2, all you can drink fir 25.00!!!. Great deal! as well as 2 for one yards like kahunaville. Walk the casino and find these deals. All in all I was very happy with everything.
Love the location on the strip. Rooms ate nice. Woman at desk accusede of making a racist comment and what she repeated was not even close to what i said. We did get free upgrade
What a ****hole.  Room service never picks up.  Terrence, the food service manager is completely incompetent, and Ozzie, the night manager made excuses instead of trying to satisfy the customer.
Table games dealers are jaded and cranky -- they seem to enjoy when players lose.  Pit bosses are paranoid -- bet ramp ups at BJ cause problems.  Went from $25 to $200 and the PB looked like he wanted to strangle me.   Don't use a players club card, comps are impossible to get.
My friend and I were really excited to stay here because we are both huge fans of pirates and it was pretty inexpensive to stay there two weekend nights. We arrived at 1:00 p.m. for early check in, which was no problem. Our room had two queen size beds, smaller TV, mini fridge and a pretty decent sized bathroom. We also had a great view of the strip.. . The second morning, our toilet over flowed for (apparently) no reason. We immediately alerted the front desk and a staff member came up right away and fixed it. He alerted housekeeping and they came and cleaned everything up, gave us fresh towels and so on. Awesome response time- very impressed!. . The last night, three things happened:. #1: came home from dinner and found a VERY LARGE cockroach chilling in our bathroom. We scooted him out of our room, after screeching like little girls. . #2: while getting ready for bed, a man used his key in our door and, to my surprise, it opened! My friend was in the shower and I was half naked, so it was quite a shock. . 3#: our friend the cockroach came back! The space between the door and the floor is large and so he had no problem sneaking back into our room. . . We had a bit of trouble checking out; the automated TV service wasn't responding and it was stuck on Spanish. We had to go down to the desks to check out (which I've never had to do but whatever.). . The pool scene is great (music stops at 6PM, pool closes at 7PM); the bartender with the dreads made GREAT DRINKS!. . All and all, I'd come here again.... But after I've explored other options.
Stayed here for 1 night and the room was really nice. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size. My only complaint was that there was no outlet by the nightstand to charge my phone.
Spent my 40th birthday stay (Sept. 2012) at TI and had a decent time though I've had more fun at other resorts. TI's rooms are spacious and clean and their housekeeping was top notch. I had zero issues with the room my entire 6-day stay there. Buffet was ordinary but I did like some of the drink choices at the various bars. There's a really good pizza place near Mysterie Theatre but it closes early which makes no sense being that it's Vegas. 99% of my late-night eating was done at other resorts. Casino was ok. Won $50 at blackjack one day, lost it the next. I was there the opening weekend of the college football season so there seemed to be a lot of UNLV fans there, which was cool. They were all fun people. I did not see Mysterie but instead went across the street to see La Reve at The Wynn. The underlying theme of my birthday stay at TI was that most of my adventures were done elsewhere. The Syrens show was interesting the first time then got tiring every time you walk by it for a week. I'd probably stay there again ONLY if I got a discounted room which I got from the booking agent because it was my birthday.
I write this with a heavy heart. Everything was fine. But Bed Bugs attacked me :-(. And I am no Diva but this made me sad!!!!! Anyway to sanitize beds???? Otherwise A ok.
Of the 13 times in the last 10 years, we've stayed here 11 times; this was our favorite hotel and casino. We love the location, the casino, the Starbucks inside- everything.. . Checking in has never been the most hospitable part of the trip. We understand that they're trying to get a bunch of people checked in and out simultaneously, and we don't mind waiting in the long line.. . We booked our trip long before the 3PM check-in time rule, and we arrived at 8 in the morning. I asked the Manager how I might be able to pay the extra $25 dollars to check in early, and he quite rudely told me that I just couldn't check in until later. He then told me that we had to leave the lobby, and take our luggage out of it. When I asked another person what was going on, she begged me to please get my luggage out of the lobby before her Manager had a talk with her about it.. . When we were finally able to check in at 10AM, I commented on how rude the Manager was (and that everyone else was nice) and she looked worried that he might overhear me. He stood in the background frowning and shaking his head "no" the entire 20 minutes we waited in the express check-in line.. . I HATE IT WHEN EMPLOYEES ARE SCARED OF THEIR BOSSES- this is not the way to manage staff. This is unprofessional, and does not give the customer a very good impression of how things are run.. . Plus- the pool is a miserly little pad of water, and all of the chairs are chained together in these creepy rows. It's just not aesthetic or comfortable to sunbathe so close to strangers. Every other hotel on the strip has a much better family-friendly pool, even the Flamingo or the Monte Carlo!. . We have just booked another trip, and we're going to stay elsewhere, until we hear they've gotten their acts together.
Beware of duplicate charges made to your credit card. I booked a reservation for myself and three of my business colleagues (4 rooms total). During check out we notice our hotel bills contain many inaccuracies and duplicate billing charges from the hotel bars and restaurants. Two days later, I received an email from the property stating they are charging me an additional $65.00 for a no-show fee. I was there, I have the hotel bill to prove it. I had to call Expedia and Treasure Island multiple times to get any type of resolution.
Traeasure Island always had its own unique charm. Over the years it has changed eateries and other various things, but the rooms are comfortable.  The rooms have a different decor than the rest of the strip, yet feels luxurious.  The pool area is a tad small so be prepared for large crowds in the summer months. The buffet here is gourmet and worth the price. Kahunaville is a unique type if bar and worth the trip. I love TI!
TI provides a great location and decent quality rooms for a reasonable price. The value is hard to beat, which is why I have stayed here a handful of times over the past decade, which comprises a significant number of the 2-3 trips to Vegas I average per year.. . With that said, some aspects of TI have been on the decline since it was sold off by MGM-Mirage. First, the dinning and nightlife options have been significantly downgraded. TI seems to be in transition from a place which catered to a young crowd to a primarily budget oriented crowd. . . For example, TI used to offer a decent nightclub (Tangerine), a great sushi restaurant (Social House), and a great lunch option (Canter's Deli). None of those options were replaced by a near equivalent when they departed. Senior Frog's is the closest thing to a nightclub, and there is no restaurant of note.  Also, I did notice that the beds were a bit overly warn in on this past trip. But these are things I can live with in light of the competitive rates.. . Here's why I had to reduce the review from 3 stars to 2:. . Our party had a problem with the Cabana host. We were told that the cost for a Cabana was $145, then later billed $300 exclusive of food, beverages, or extras. The servers were relatively unapologetic for the miscommunication and nobody from TI would take any responsibility for THEIR mistake. The issue was never resolved fully resolved, though a cabana host ultimately reduced the price to $275, which seemed arbitrary. Nonetheless, our party was forced to pay a price that it did not agree to, which was nearly double what we were quoted - as witnessed by several of us. . . Further, the server treated us like degenerates and would not allow us to leave the pool area until she counted out our payment, which of course was sufficient. This added insult to injury. Nobody threatened to not to pay, or to only pay $145. We just sucked it up and paid an amount we did not agree to. This all made for an embarrassing and aggravating experience, and I regretted ever setting foot at the TI pool. . . There is plenty of competition on the strip for cabana's. $145 sounded like a reasonable price for a cabana at TI, when comparing it's small, dumpy pool to competitors who charge double or more. If we were at the Venetian pool or EBC, this would be recognized as an obvious error. Not at TI, however. . . Overall, I do not think I would return as a guest at TI because of how my party was treated at the pool. Our food and drink bill was well over $400 before tip, so I am uncertain why our servers felt it was imperative to pull a bait and switch on the cabana price. TI was 100% responsible for the confusion, and they should have acted accordingly. Instead of elevating the issue to a manager, it was simply along the lines of "sorry, this is what you have to pay." . . Luckily, there are always plenty of options in Vegas and I will be happy to take my business somewhere else.
For the price, this place was great! I loved the big tub/shower and the view was phenomenal! We stayed on the 34th floor and had a corner room so we were not complaining. They have check out on the TV which was hilarious and convenient rolled into one. We saw the Mystere Cirque du Soleil show in the hotel as well and were completely blown away!! If we ever come back, and that's a big if since we decided after our trip here we are DEFINITELY not crowd people, that we would come back here. For being on the strip, its easy access to everything else there is to do. The only bummer is that, us being coffee people, there wasn't a coffee maker in our room.
What can I say that hasn't been already said? Its good but not great, its priced reasonable but not super cheap, the rooms are clean the bed is comfortable and not too noisy. The layout can be slightly confusing and the parking is a bi..h but its a decent place to stay in mid strip.
Oh Treasure Island.. what have you done with yourself?. . And yes.. I REFUSE to call this TI... That is one of the most pathetic rebrands Vegas has ever seen.. . You were my childhood dream. You were the place when cold Edmonton, was well.. cold.. I would escape to in my mind. Your pirate theme allowed for adults and kids alike to enjoy themselves.. you gave families a place to share being.... . And then you went and ruined it all.. every bit of it.. . I haven't stay at the hotel since the 90's.. but my recent visit may be my last ever inside your once friendly confines.. . I know you had lost your way.. it was clear as soon as the iconic sign of a skull and cross bones found it's way to the Neon Museum... but when i went searching for THE.. THE best arcade/midway that Vegas ever had.. and where I threw so much of my parents money away, it's not even funny, I was sad... nay DEVASTATED to find you had replaced the two floors of amazement, the entrance with automated skeletons to boot.. with a room? . . A ROOM? With a pathetic array of machines left over from the golden years? . . For shame.. FOR SHAME.. . I gave you a second star simply for the memories.. and for the hope that one day you can do and be what you used to be.
The most horrible service I have ever experienced for a hotel; I wouldn't expect such a fine establishment to have horrible service. I shall not recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a great time in Las Vegas to come to this hotel. . . The story, our room door would not open and so the following things happened over a 2 day period (we missed our shows [Money loss]) :. 1. Replaced room card, this did not work - 30 minutes. 2. Called maintenance, waited an hour outside for them to come, opened door - 1 hour. 3. Called maintenance again, waited an hour outside for them to come - 1.5 hours. 4. Talk to managers, they did not help very much - 1.5 Hours. 5. maintenance came and did nothing but call someone else - 45 minutes. 6. maintenance comes, the staff did not document anything and we waited longer - 45 minutes. 7. maintenance door comes, replaces the entire door assembly. - 1 hour. 8. Talked to front desk - 45 minutes. . This had more to it but that was just the summery of what happened.... . Just say no and go somewhere else.. That is all.... . PS. I hate writing 1 star reviews but when its deserved, I rate them appropriately.
I've stayed here several times before, but this is the last. When I checked in, the room rate was way higher than what I had agreed to pay when I made the reservation. The manager was unwilling to help and was borderline rude. They don't care about their guests, stay somewhere else.
