Love this place!! It has a lovely, romantic, intimate atmosphere. The patio is beautiful (especially at night, with the twinkle lights on), but the inside of this old house is so charming as well!.. . The food has always been outstanding! Hands-down one of my favorite pizza places. I recommend the Margherita pizza -- the simplicity allows the high quality ingredients to really shine through. The crepes are so delicious as well.. . I gave it 4/5 stars because the service is a bit lacking. The servers aren't generally super friendly, though not quite unpleasant. It's one of the places where you feel almost like an inconvenience to them. Perhaps that's just me though.. . At any rate, I will continue to return, because the food and ambiance are wonderful!
Cibo is one of my favorite restaurants here in the valley.  It has everything that I'm looking for.  Excellent food (pizza), good prices, great vibe and scene.  I have been here several times, but we last visited Cibo the other day so it refreshed my memory.  Plus, I realized that I never reviewed it before!. . Anyways, we came on a Tuesday afternoon during happy hour.  It was such a nice spring Phoenix afternoon that we sat outside in their patio.  Actually, this is all we have ever sat at on our prior visits.  It's because I absolutely love their patio.  It really feels like I'm eating in a outdoor garden.  Such a cool and great feel, one of the main reasons why we keep coming back.  The inside is also very nice, Cibo is a converted home into a restaurant, but we just prefer to sit on the patio.. . For the happy hour menu they have several appetizers from $4-$6 dollars, plus $4 house wines and $2.5 Peronis. We ordered the Polpette (meatballs with bread).  It was great, Cibo's sauce was amazing and a great compliment to the meatballs.  . . We also ordered from the pizza menu, the Diavola with added ricotta cheese.  It was a tomato based sauce pizza with spicy salame.  Our server recommend that  we add ricotta cheese.  I'm glad that we did, this was a great pizza.  it was perfectly cooked.  Crust was flakey, yet soft.  The ricotta added a nice creamy texture.  We really enjoyed our pizza, and with the appetizer it was a good amount of food for my wife and i to split.. . We ended up passing on dessert, but have had their crepes before and they were excellent.. . I really can't say much more about Cibo.  Again it is one of our go to places to eat while we are in downtown Phoenix.  This is a perfect place to enjoy a nice romantic meal at decent prices.  Can't really beat the value here, nor the food.   We look forward to coming back sometime soon!
Horrible service!  It took 20 minutes for the salad!  40 minutes for the pizza!  The salad had little to no dressing.  The wait staff never checked it to ask how the food was.  I had to go get the hostess.  When the pizza finally came it was decent.  The wine was weak.  I felt like I was on an episode of Nightmare Kitchens.  Sorry--they blew it.  I can't believe this restaurant was featured on Check Please, Arizona.  The ambiance is the only thing it has going for it--if you don't mind be ignored and waiting for ever.
If I'm ever back in Arizona I will totally be coming back here! I came here once and was really impressed with all aspects of this place. The restaurant itself had an authentic feel which made it a much more enjoyable meal with a great atmosphere. Aside from the ambiance, the food was so damn good! The Tomato Mozzarella Sandwich was amazing and the pizzas are seriously delicious. The potato pizza was the business! Ah wish I could get some of this in California...
Cool spot to eat at, been a guest many times over the years they've been open. food never fails, service is good. Plenty of wines to choose from and plenty of fresh ingredients in use, really like this place.
I love Cibo's!!!  Way better than Pizzeria Bianco!  Much better menu for all to choose vs just a few "fufu" items!!
Such a hidden gem in downtown Phoenix. I love sharing them with new people! A delicious menu, my personal favorite is the calzone. The Nutella and banana crepe is also a MUST, so save room for dessert! Love their outdoor seating, but inside is charming too. They have a nice private eating area too if you have a special event. I will definitely be hosting a rehearsal dinner there when my wedding time comes! It's truly one of the culinary bests in the Phoenix area, I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys good food, wine and company!. . The only thing I can say though is that on Friday and Saturday nights, they fill up quickly! But it is definitely worth the wait! And normally you don't wait as long as they quote you :)
Love this place.  Always a treat!
First time we went there 5 stars. Second time was for my birthday and the inlaw tried ordering cal zone and didn't take my warning that it is just like their pizza, just folded. Anyways I give it 5 stars for me, but I had a four star birthday there because I was the only one who enjoyed it. Diavola pizza is killer!
Cibo is a great place to get fresh, delicious pizza in an intimate setting. The crepes are also delicious and I recommend this place to anyone looking for quality food at a good price. The fact that it is an historic house adds charm!
We had an absolutely lovely weeknight dinner here.  The patio was shaded, the misters gently cooling us, and the gorgeous landscape providing a relaxing atmosphere.  The cappuccino, quattro fromaggi pizza, the Margherita pizza, gnocchi, pear salad, and the banana  nutella crepe were great.  Probably the only thing I might not order again would be the pear salad as it didn't seem to be the greatest value.  The pizzas and crepe were PERFECT!  Soft, yet chewy crust delicately supporting the toppings with just a bit of gorgonzola on the quattro pizza!
Great Pizza, awesome staff, cool spot- enough said, go eat!
This place is awesome! It's very quaint as it is a house converted into a restaurant. We sat outside but didn't realize that there had been construction being done on the street. At times it was so loud we just didn't bother to try and repeat what we had said. The other thing was the offensive smell! The dumpster sits right by the parking lot of the restaurant and if you sit outside you get a disgusting whiff of it every once in a while. Very unappetizing. . . The food itself is delicious! I got the mele salad which has caramelized walnuts, blue cheese, and apple slices. The dressing perfectly complimented the other ingredients. The pizza was had a delicious crust and ooey gooey cheese. One of the better specialty pizzas I've had. . . . Definitely would go back and have!
Delicious, great environment, would definitely go back!   We got the "capricciosa" pizza, salad, and a really yummy dessert that consisted of nice little fried dough balls and Nutella.  Mmmm!  The house is beautiful as well, so much more character here than out in the 'burbs!
NEVER a complaint about the food or ambiance.  As far as a great meal and great atmosphere are concerned, this is the best place in Phoenix.  The only reason for the 3 stars is the hit-or-miss service.  Sometimes you get the best service you've ever had and sometimes you think your waiter forgot you sat down 30 minutes ago.  I want to give 5 stars, but I just can't.
So yesterday I'm in CenPho and pull out my handy dandy yelp app... I see reviews from Reese / Moanz / Samantha for this place less than a block away and it made my decision VERY easy.  . . It's a cool old house, and probably not a place I would ever stop if not for the amazing reviews (which were spot on by the way).  Within fifteen minutes I was enjoying one of the best pizza pies I've tasted in Arizona... and the gorgonzola almost threw me off.  I'm glad I went with my instinct, the pie was perfectly cooked and the flavors were out of sight.  . . Add to this an ice cold bottle of Peroni - and I was quite pleased with my decision.  Between this and Pomo, I'm convinced that it's the best couple of pies within a half mile anywhere in AZ.  COME EAT HERE!  You won't regret it.. . Also, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but if you like Nutella, you must try their Nutella crepe... it's pretty freaking tasty!
This pizza might as well be flown first class from Naples, so if you're looking for Neapolitan style you're in the right place, the mozz was a little too salty, and take the little tomato halves off the pizza Margherita, they don't belong there, that's the only thing I'd tweak. In addition to a great pizza, it's a very pretty place to sit and dine inside or out.
This place has a special spot in my heart (my boyfriend and I had our first date here). We usually start the dinner waiting at the bar with a bottle of wine. The bartenders know their stuff! They always recommend an awesome wine. When we get a table, we know what we want immediately. My favorite pizza is La Noce. Ricotta, tomato sauce, walnuts and we add proscuitto: it is to die for. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the last two times we've gone, our server was less than attentive. After waiting 35 minutes and drinking almost a bottle of wine, we want to order! I love this place, amazing food, gorgeous patio and friendly bar staff.
I really wanted to give Cibo 5 stars from the minute we drove by and saw the place. The delicious smells, the live music, the twinkly little lights draped all around the yard...I just knew it was going to be wonderful. . . We were quoted 20 min for a party of two for first available, but I read on yelp to expect that to be off -and it was...closer to 40 minutes- but it was a nice evening, and I was mentally exhausted from the long drive from Las Vegas, so I didn't mind that. . . We are seated and I was excited we wound up with a nice patio seat. Our server brought us some menus and when we ordered water she sort of rolled her eyes at us. I don't know how the serving situation works here - one young lady was handing water, wrapping silverware, and apparently picking up all the slack of the actual waitress. She brought us water, and about15 min later, seeing we still had menus, kind of shook her head to herself and got the actual waitress. We ordered and she disappeared again, but the girl with water checked on us and brought us a little carafe. . . The people beside us had ordered dessert as we ordered our food, 1 dessert to share. The people from the kitchen ended up coming to ask what they had ordered. Our food showed up, and it was really good. We got a quattro formaggi and the pizza with speck, Asian pears and goat cheese. We finished and waited for the bill, and then waited to pay. Finally ready to leave, we realized we needed to break a $20 for the valet. I walked back inside, (where by the way wait staff runs past you each time you walk in the door and makes you feel tremendously in their way) and the host acted like I was really bothering him by asking such a menial question and said that he didn't have any change to give me and I should has asked my server, to which I almost replied "I would, had I ever seen her for more than 2 seconds." (Like I said, almost told him that, I try to be friendly and polite though.) . . I walked back out and saw my server, asked her to break a 20, she said the valet should have change, then threw her head back laughing? I don't know, it was very odd. The nicest person i encountered here was definitely the young lady (I'm 31, so the younger-than-me lady) handling water and silverware. I hope she is getting a cut of the tips, and had I been able to get change before walking out to the car, I definitely would have slipped her some of it. . . Those poor people beside us might still be waiting for their Fresca, whipped cream on the side. . . Ambiance: 5 stars. Food: 4 stars. Service: 2 stars
Really tasty pizza, I've been here twice and it is really good stuff, the Nutella crepes for desert are so good. If you like a good drink I'd recommend the limoncello, it's like a lemon drop in liquid form, the lemon concentrate is strong though hardly sour. The prices are a tad high but it's still worth it, the quality of ingredients are definitely superb and the serving sizes are generous. Definitely would be a nice place to bring a date. I would recommend this place for sure.
The pizza here is very, very good.  Not quite the caliber of Pizzeria Bianco or Pomo, but it's very close.  Better than that though is the venue, it is in a very interesting old house, with one of the best outdoor patios you can find in downtown phoenix.
The atmosphere is great, and the pizza and sandwiches, while simple, are always delicious and well done.  Parking is a little difficult.  The White Sangria is lovely.  This is a prime downtown lunch spot, but its viability as dinner location has been diminished with the addition of the adjacent Vig.
The food is just as good as the atmosphere I loved the pizza salad & crepes was just sad we missed out on the pasta (only served certain nights) but I'll be back to try it!
Cibo has a great patio, a few quality happy hour offerings, and the exciting promise of gluten free pizza. Sadly, the good things about it didn't make up for the not so good things. On the plus side, the polenta fries were fantastic and the wife was a big fan of the gnocchi. On the minus side, the pizza was relatively tasteless (like it needed salt) and I'm pretty sure it made me sick. I don't know if it was the gluten free option or the cheese, of which I rarely eat, but I woke up the next morning violently ill. My wife ate the same thing and didn't have a problem, so perhaps it was a fluke. Either way, it just didn't excite us the way the Yelp reviews did. Much sadness ensued.
Amazing crepes! The berry crepes were to die for. I want to try the Nutella ones next time.
