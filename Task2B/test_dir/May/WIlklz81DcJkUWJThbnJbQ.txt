This is my second time staying here & this is a an awesome hotel!! The staff from the front desk, housekeeping, maintenance, security to pool staff are SUPER friendly!!! They all were always very happy & up beat! They definitely love working here!!! It makes the stay so much better when you have this type of staff. I highly recommend staying here. Can be a little pricey esp. The $28:night resort fee but you definitely get what you pay for. The bed was sooooo comfortable along with the pillows. Master bathroom is very spacious & I like the extra bathroom for room guests. Just like a mini apartment, with a full kitchen minus a real oven (conventional). I would stay here again! Thanks Vdara staff for making our stay fabulous!!!!
Got upgraded from the 10th floor to 25th floor cuz we came for a bachelorette weekend :) soo much better since we stayed in the panoramic view room
Falls under expectations. Front desk staff is indifferent, feels like I'm at Target. I called in regards to a room change because ours smelled like acidic vinegar, and they said they'll either bring up fans or to come back down. Down we go, to find another huge line. I asked a front desk attendant who I should be talking to, he was rude in telling me the front desk lady I spoke to doesn't exist and he directed me to wait in the corner for his manager. Upon small talk with the manager that the front area is disorganized, he had no comment, just stayed mum. He threw my ID back unto the table and slid it towards me. No one took a moment to apologize for the inconvenience. Upon getting my new room key card, I realized the whole floor smelled like vinegar. Upon entering, the room feels like a Marriott Springfield Suites, you know one of those business extended stays, but no coffee machine :T If you're looking for a no-smoking, no casino hotel, I recommend the Trump, with a great view looking down from the north strip.
So far, this seems to be my go to hotel over my last couple of vegas trips. It's pretty much the aria without the casino and the smoking.. . Service here is top notch and quick. Everything from the valet to the room service was perfect for me. If you're staying here, try to get a room with the view of the bellagio fountains or else you'll be stuck looking at the city or the cosmo.. . I guess the draw back is that it doesn't have anything going on in the hotel itself but since it's walking distance to the City Center, Cosmo and Aria, you can't really complain.. . Overall, clean and safe and located in the middle of the strip. I can't complain!
Love this hotel. Very friendly staff. Clean spacious rooms. I HIGHLY recommend this property. Will def keep this property in mind the next time i go to Vegas.
The last time I was in Vegas I stayed at the Vdara and I have to say it's been one of my favorites. It's a smoke free facility and there's no casino, but I don't mind because I don't gamble or smoke. I heard  this hotel was built more so for people doing business which is why it's more clean and sleek than most other hotels in Vegas. I loved the interior of our room and most of all the bathroom. The bathroom is most important to me because lighting for make up is everything :) the only thing is I feel like not a lot of young adults stay here so it felt a bit awkward walking out of the lobby in our club attire, we were literally the only ones both nights...awwwwkward not really. But I would def stay here again
This place is billed as a 5 star hotel and spa. It is not period. This place is nothing more than a condo building that failed to sell so they turned it into a hotel to generate revenue. This place might appeal to families and people who like a little less hustle and bustle but if you came to Vagas to have a good time there are much better "5 star" hotels.. . Plus. . 1. Rooms are spacious and modern. . 2. Huge bathtub was good for soaking. 3 Free valet parking. . Minus. . 1. Its off the strip. You have to walk a good 10-15 minutes to get there. 2. No casino. 3. There is an amenity fee but there ironic thing is there are no amenities!!! The pool is tiny (and I mean really tiny), ditto the gym. There is one overpriced restaurant and a Starbucks in the lobby and thats it! You get more amenities at Circus Circus (which costs $50 a night). . 4. All the rooms have a microwave and a stove but no coffee pot. Seriously. Who comes to vegas to cook on a stove. Space could have been much better utilized. Only thing I want in a hotel is the ability to make a cup of coffee when I want it. Not here. 5. Front desk is small and gets backed up at busy times. Expect to wait in line.. 6. Hotel does not have a capable 24 hour cleaning service. If you arrive at the Venetian at 7am they will find you a room. Not here. You have to keep to regular hotel check in and out hours. This is completely out of line from all the other hotels on the strip that are used to the 24 hour nature of this city. We arrived at 9am and made to wait to check in until 11am. Front desk let it be known that they were inconvenienced by the early checkin.. 7. The doors to the hotel are not very well designed. There are no automatic doors. A minor inconvenience as you are coming and going but a serious pain when you are arriving with luggage. There are no bell hops and so it just made check in and check out feel like a root canal.. 8. Master switch was a royal pain. None of the lights would turn on unless this was turned on. Cleaner would turn it off on a daily basis and it just rubbed us up the wrong way.. 9. Security guard nazis will not allow you into the elevator without a room key. Seriously, is this Sprint Break at Panama City?. 10. AC unit in our room had a hard time getting below 68. I like to sleep in cold temperatures.. . The only saving grace about this supposed 5 star hotel is that we used Priceline ($125 per night on a summer weekend) and we didn't pay full price. I was expecting much more but in the end we got what we paid for. I would have been livid had we paid full price.
Loved it! I've stayed in a few strip hotels, albeit not nice ones--Bally's, Excalibur, etc. Vdara was awesome because its located on the central Strip with easy access to all of the good stuff on the Strip. Even though the hotel itself is not directly on Las Vegas Boulevard, its really easy to get there (a really quick 5-10 minute walk) and there's a tram that goes to/from Bellagio/Vdara/Aria/Monte Carlo.There's no casino in Vdara, but it is connected to Bellagio and Aria, so you can easily go from your suite to the casino floor in 5 minutes. I was worried it would feel more isolated and less "classic Vegas" not staying at a casino hotel, but it was actually great. It was quieter and I could actually breathe in the lobby (no cigarette smoke). The lobby area had a few restaurants and a Starbucks. The rooms were awesome! I went with my family and we got two rooms--one Deluxe suite (the standard/basic one) and one Vdara suite (a slight upgrade from the Deluxe suite). Both rooms were clean, spacious, had beautiful Strip views, nice bathrooms, comfortable beds, and little kitchenette areas. Both rooms also have a large pull-out couch, which was nice because Vdara doesn't have any double queen rooms--only single kings. The Vdara suite was bigger and had an extra half bathroom, separated bedroom and living room, the kitchen was larger, and it had a washer/dryer in the room. Pretty awesome. Everything about the rooms were very modern--even down to the fancy little buttons that you push for housekeeping/do not disturb/etc. The minibar prices were kind of steep, but oh well, that's Vegas. We didn't spend too much time in our rooms but we loved them when we did. The pool area was also great. It was pretty busy (we didn't go to the pool until 2pm on a Saturday), so we didn't get a spot on the lounge chairs by the pool deck, butwe still found a spot on some comfy couches and chairs near the bar and private cabanas. There was a larger pool and a few smaller hot tubs. Not too many children in the pool either, thank goodness. The prices for drinks at the pool bar were kind of ridiculous ($8 for a beer, $14 for a cocktail) but the pina coladas we ordered were quite tasty. I never made it to the gym and spa, but I also heard they were nice. Next time I go to Vegas, I will definitely be staying at Vdara again!
The Vdara is a very solid hotel choice for someone looking to stay near the Las Vegas Strip. It does not, however, have the feel of a luxury five-star hotel across the board. First, the good: the rooms are very nice and spacious, with stunning views from the higher floors, comfortable beds, large bathrooms, and a relatively modern look. There is no casino, so that gives the lobby a quieter feel and helps you take a breather from the commercial cheesiness of Las Vegas. There is a complimentary valet, an extremely relaxing spa area (with purchase of a reasonable day pass), and a friendly/attentive concierge. On the negative side, the pool area leaves something to be desired. It felt crowded and lacked an air of tranquility, to the extent that I would highly recommend daily rental of their "private" cabanas instead, which are pretty awesome (though undivided, so you're basically sharing with the cabanas around you). The hotel also lacks personality. It very much has the feel of a giant condo building, with a transient lobby area, a sad excuse for a bar, and a tiny market/sandwich shop in lieu of a proper restaurant. The location is decent but not amazing. Yes, it's close to the Aria, but getting to the Strip required a very long, circuitous walk - a bonus if you're eating like a fat whale, but slightly limiting if you're looking to shoot back and forth from the hotel to certain attractions. Finally,the bath products are downright nasty - the same kind of cheap, overdrying soaps and shampoos you'd expect to find at a Holiday Inn Express, not a five-star hotel. Overall, it's a GOOD hotel, but it's definitely worth exploring other options.
Came for a weekend with a large group of co-workers and it started off horrible from the minute we checked in! I don't even know where to begin. Our boss was going to pay not only for the rooms but the deposit you make in case anything else gets charged or things get ruined. They billed me anyways! Our rooms were not ready and they took our cell numbers and said they would call when ready, never did! Asked if we wanted coffee in our room. Never brought it! We asked them to bring sheets etc. for the fold out bed/couch and to please get it ready. Never did! At the pool we sat down and it took 45min to get a drink and just as long to get the bill! The only time we had some good service was at the little bar downstairs. Eric was great! This did not make up for anything though! DO NOT EVER GO THERE OR YOU WILL BE SORRY! I have stayed at many other las Vegas hotels and had great service! Beware!
Great Corner Suite!. . Love that its non-gaming when my kids come. They love the monorail! For a quiet, non gaming, no smoky air experience, after a fun night in town this hits the spot. . . Used the washer and dryer, the Kitchen and separate bedroom and auto shades are all super chic.. . Self-parking is not available only valet. Here we go again.
We've stayed at Vdara for our past 3 trips to Las Vegas. To us, it's centrally located to our dining and gambling comings and goings on the Strip. Vdara is part of the "new" City Center that is comprised of the Crystals Shopping Center, Aria, Cosmopolitan and Mandarin resorts and casinos. This property does not have a casino located in it, it is 100% smoke free and touts itself as featuring natural and green room amenities. All of Vdara's rooms are clean, spacious suites that include a well stocked mini-bar, mini refrigerator, microwave oven, cabinets and wet bar sink. Although, to me, it seems a bit odd to have a microwave oven and mini-kitchen like cabinets in this type of suite. I suppose "it works" for visitors on extended stays. In the bathroom, there is a full-sized soaking tub and shower, vanity and very quiet flushing toilet. What is impressive is the comfort of the bed...once you lie down, you'll find yourself drifting off to sleep. . . There is a small gym and pool. Nothing like its sister properties, but, maybe this hotel usually attracts business travelers or gamblers instead of families.. Service is top notch from door-to-door. Everyone is friendly and attentive. All you need is to ask and they'll do their best to "make it happen" for you.
Wow!  This place cannot be beat.  Love the fact that there is no casino and that it is a non smoking hotel.  The place just FEELS clean from the second you walk in.
Modern hotel in the heart of the strip, but be warned you are not on the strip and you'll have to walk through either the Bellagio or Aria to get to the Blvd.  The room was spacious, and the view was nice.  The resort fee covers a daily newspaper and internet, and the internet was fast.  The cafe in the lobby is definitely overrated, both in cost and quality.  The Starbucks is like any other Starbucks but a few dollars more than you may be used to paying.  You are better off going to one of the casino's cafes or pastry/chocolate stands to get breakfast.    The fridge is small, and we never bothered using the kitchenette.  Also, as previous reviewers have noted the light switches you need to get up to turn off the lights if you are in bed.  I'd stay here again, but not at full room rate.. . Parking is free, and you can rent a car from the Aria casino during your stay, and if you want to explore outside of the strip this is a must.
Ambience and room was sufficient, however the service left something to be expected. We were so excited about staying in this chic looking hotel with the newer city centre section of Vegas. Two other people that I stayed with stayed at the Aria and immediately stated that the two were not comparable. Meaning Aria was way better especially service wise. When we checked in the hotel attendant welcomed us with a smirk and got on the phone to ask about giving us an accessible room as the deluxe booked rooms were all sold out. Ok, my friend mentioned that we were celebrating her birthday and the attendant states that she would see what she could do. When we reserved our room we booked through the hotel's website we thought we were taking advantage of the stay two nights and get a $50 food and beverage credit. However when we checked in we had to remind her or the offer after she said she didn't see anything like that. That really gave me a bad first impression vibe and little did I know the room service would be even worse:( when we finally got to our room on the 20th floor we had a nice view of city center. The decor was nice and we had a kitchenette for our convenience. Since it was accessible space wasn't an issue. Later that night we requested extra blankets and towels and never received them. So I'm the morning I was stuck waiting again for towels and could not shower or anything until they came. That night we found that the pull out bed had springs sticking out and decided to go to the front desk to express our concerns. The attendant apologized and promised when they cleaned the room we would have two extra feather beds for the pull out. To our surprise that evening we had nothing. So we called and express more concern and they informed us that the promise of two feather beds should not have happened due to the fact that the two could damage the bed but that they would honor what we were promised. After 30 mins they brought the beds and other requested items. Our last incident came when we left the next day and called for our room to be service after we left around 3pm. When we returned at 6:30 our room had not been serviced. We called once again and they apologized which at this point meant nothing...gave the resort fees back, bottles of water and more towels...our trash was over flowing and dirty towels were everywhere...it was a gross feeling all night and morning. I ran out promising never to book the Vdara again!
Gorgeous hotel.  Great views.  No smoke filled casino to get through.  LOVED it.  You are a little off the strip, but I liked it.  We got our car out of valet to drive down to the Neon Museum (DO IT), but other than that, pretty much walked everywhere.  The rooms are huge, the bathtubs are AMAZING, and the housekeeping is great.  The front desk clerks are very nice and the maintenance staff is very quick.  I would stay here again and again.
The stay at the Vdara was fantastic!  We visit Las Vegas several times a year and will never stay anywhere else again.  Summer upgraded us when we checked in from the panoramic suite to the one bedroom penthouse and it was lovely!  The suite looked out over the fountains at the Bellagio - the view was to die for!  There was a full kitchen and washer and dryer in the unit.  There was a large soaking tub and very nice shower.  We absolutely loved the Vdara!!!
This was my first time staying here. It is not the typical vegas stay. It is quieter. It is less hectic. It feels like going home. . . The rooms aren't rooms, they are suites. Some complain about the lack of "action" here. That's the point. We walked and got cabs to everything crazy and exciting Vegas is supposed to be, then when we drug our butts back to Vdara it was perfect. Quiet and relaxing. Great for recharging and going at it tomorrow. . . The pool area is more hotel pool than resort pool. The cafe and bar downstairs are good. The location is great, short walk to the strip, aria, and bellagio. . . If your idea of vegas is leaving the room to stay in the building for a buffet and gambling then this isn't for you. You sleep here, relax here, eat and drink a little here, then you go out to experience vegas. . . Great water pressure, room temp control, nice views from the corner suites. It gave us a high roller feel. And housekeeping took the time not to just clean up and make the bed, but we noticed small things. A pair of shorts thrown on a chair were folded, our toiletries strewn about the sink were lined up neatly. I know these are small things but they don't happen everywhere. Even other nice places I've stayed on the strip they don't happen.. . If I had one complaint, it would be in the billing. The daily $25 resort fees (just include it in the rate) and the 100 dollar per day security charge that they hold onto for a week after you leave. That security deposit seems unnecessary.  . . Overall though I loved it.
A great place to stay with amazing rooms and fantastic customer service.  Very clean modern and classy place that's a short walk off the strip.  . . Juan in the Business center also did a great job for us when I needed to get some documents scanned for business.. . Really recommend a stay at the Vdara!  Price is very reasonable and you will love the room.
After having stayed here on two separate occasions within a 60 day period, the Vdara is now my "Go To Hotel" while in Vegas. I stayed in both a split and full room of which by the way all rooms are suites! The out the door price per night was fantastic on both trips for work and the "Wow" factor for me was when one of the early morning car valets recognized me from my first trip in early March and acknowledged me on my second trip at the end of April. In addition, I like the fact that the planners had really thought aboutthe access entering and departing the hotel when using a car as you can enter on the backside of the hotel on Harmon Ave and not have to fight the mobs of people walking on Las Vegas Blvd. Great job Vdara! The Vdara and Aria which are one of the many hotels owned by MGM share the same circle car entrance which is also very nice and one can walk  from the Vdara to the Aria without any hassles to the various restaurants, cafes and bars without working up a sweat.
Great hotel, great staff! 4.5 stars!. . Vdara is a nice hotel to choose if you want to avoid the craziness of Vegas. It's technically off the strip but a three minute walk gets you inside Bellagio or Aria! . . The rooms and staff are top notch! Definitely a plus when they remember your name! Cici helped me out several times and was able to get me extra keys and late check out! I had two rooms and one was upgraded to the city view. . . I recommend trying to get it upgraded or booking it over the deluxe because the room setup is nicer, more spacious and you get a good view of Vegas! Both have great identical bathrooms! I enjoyed the soaking tub. Room comes with a kitchen as well, didn't use it much except for the mini fridge for storing booze.. . Hotel only has a Starbucks, bar and little food shop in the lobby. Pool was average. Not your typical Vegas pool full of drunk people and loud music.. . I wouldn't stay here if you want the whole "Vegas" experience. Those urges to hop from hotel to hotel to gamble, drink, club and eat cheap greasy food are difficult because of the location.
I had to spend a few days in Vegas house hunting (alone) so chose the Vdara as a comfortable, quiet option. I loved the casino-less vibe and it's tranquil environment. My suite was awesome, eat-in kitchen, sofa, bedroom and bathroom. Great tub for relaxation and a comfortable bed. Room was clean, decor was nice and all window coverings were electronic. One gripe was the bathroom door... it was 'frosted' - in other words 'see through'. I didn't like that, thankfully I was traveling alone, it would have been weird otherwise.. . The giant let down in the room was the one thing I paid extra for - the kitchen. After I had flown into town and spent a full day house hunting all I wanted to do was check-in and make myself a nice warm tea. This proved to be quite the drama. The kitchen was not equipped with anything. I had to call housekeeping and ask for a pan (to boil water) and a cup. After waiting the best part of 45 minutes (!!!) room service arrived with a pan... but no cup. Another 10 minutes and one arrived. Of course I could have gone downstairs and bought a Starbucks for less than the housekeeping tip but I don't care for their drinks.. . Anyways, my point being, why provide a kitchen if you don't provide any utensils? Why make me call housekeeping for something that should just - be there. It's like giving me a bed without a pillow.. . All in all a very nice stay, just slightly frustrating and not quite the five stars I was hoping for.
Just spent 3 nights at the Vdara.  We really liked this hotel a lot.  The hotel is smaller than the other resorts around which makes it quicker to check in and also short walks to the elevators.  Great trendy decor throughout the hotel.  We had a corner suite on the 5th floor.  Had a great view of the street and city center complex.  Staff was friendly and service was fast.  Fridge and Kurig coffee maker were a plus.  Only downside to this hotel is it is on the backside of city center and getting to the strip is a bit of a chore.  Not having a casino was not a big deal as Aria was a 2 minute walk away.  My only complaint that takes away a star is the AC in my room.  No matter what I set it to it never got cooler than 74.  We had two other guests that were with us and their rooms would cool down into the 60's.  It may have been that having large windows on 3 sides of our room and that they faced towards the west caused the room not to cool properly.  Might be something they should look at.  Also a fan in the bedroom would have been nice to.  Overall I would definitely return to this hotel.
Hotel was very nice. Bartenders at VBar were knowledgeable/professional. Loved the washer and dryer in the room and kitchen area. Beware the pool area can be HOT HOT HOT!!!
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.  Bed was great, service great, clean, friendly. I like that there is no casino so that you can come home to a quieter not smoky refuge off the strip.  Lower rooms can hear pool music so bring ear plugs for a daytime nap or request higher room.
I normally stay at Aria but for MDW we had to book our room at vdara because aria was sold out..:( .  Now why the 2 star?.   First of all they have 1 remote for 2 tv. So if the people inthe room wants to use both of the tv then we have to share remotes? And on top of that the remote was not working either. AND they took forever to bring a new remote to us and requested for extra remote but they said no..  2nd..the pull out bed was not even decent. You can feel all the springs on the bed. We requested a thicker blanket like the bed but they saud they have to check because they might of ran out.. what hotel runs out of blankets?? But luckly they found one and brought us. Yay 1 star.. 3rd we requested room service .. left the room at 11 in the morning came back to the room around 5? thinking that the room is cleaned and with fresh towels.. but no. They came in around 6 30pm of course we're in the room resting..we're not going to leave for her to clean.. we requested lots of towels and she gave us a lot so plus 1 star. All in all i will not stay at vdara again..
Memorial Day weekend was very memorable at the Vdara. Check in with no problems, room was ready and cleaned. The atmosphere, let's just say there is plenty of eye candy in the hotel. I would recommend any couple to book this hotel for a weekend getaway.
I loved everything about the Vdara!! The pool area is on the 3rd level.It was pretty spacious for all the hotel guest and they had umbrellas for when the sun was too much. They even had a DJ and a reserved area with more pools to chill at. The waitresses were really nice and quick as they could be considering it was a holiday. They have a nice selection of summer cocktails and light foods to eat so you aren't hungover. The bathrooms and views of the city center were a nice touch too! The bathroom has a deep tub that you have to relax in after a long walk on the strip and a shower too! So if it's a hotel with girls two people can get ready at once. . I liked how it was away from the hectic part of Vegas, but still luxurious. We were just a walk away from Bellagio, Aria and Cosmopolitan... Planet Hollywood was only a $7 taxi ride and it's worth it if you have on heels or if you're on a schedule. . But all in all this will be my favorite hotel to stay at from now on! Oh and get an M Life card. They give discounts.. . Bar Vdara review is seperate
My wife and I stayed here as a birthday getaway for her. This hotel is top notch. The service, from the valet, the front desk, the spa attendant to the waitress serving us cocktails at the pool are top notch. The rooms and amenities are modern. But the best part of the hotel is no smoking and no massive casino that you have to walk through to get to your room. The only negative comment I have is the $25 daily resort fee which is quite steep considering it only covers two bottles of water a day, wi-fi use in hotel, daily newspaper and printing of your boarding passes via the business center. The fee should at least include access to the sauna and jacuzzi in the spa, which is an additional $28 per day but free if you purchase a massage or facial treatment at the spa. But overall thus hotel is top notch and my new favorite place to stay in Las Vegas.
We loved our stay here!  The rooms were modern, new and well kept as was the entire hotel.  The staff were awesome - veryfriendly, helpful and pleasant.  The location is, in our opinion, one of the best in Vegas - easy access to most everything.  The pool gets pretty murky by mid-afternoon but I suppose that's to be expected with all of the suncreen and sweat (ewwww ;) and I'm sure most other places have the same problem.  The cafe charges an astronomiocal $19 for bacon and eggs, but the other deli and snack items are reasonably priced.  We loved the relative quiet (besides all the kids at the pool) and the non-smoking.  So close to Bellagio, just talk a stroll over there for a more reasonably priced breakfast :)
