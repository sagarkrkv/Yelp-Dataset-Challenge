This place is absolutely the worst. First off, we went to check in and were told to come back at 12, we came back at 12. What did they tell us again? To come back at 3. So we leave and come back at 3. And we find out that people who had NO RESERVATIONS got their rooms at 12? What? That totally defeats the purpose of making reservations in the first place. This infuriated me and my family so much but we let it go. . Then later that night I saw that the blankets on the bed were dirty. The pillow case had some kind of brown stain on it. I was disgusted. . The next morning when walking down the hall there was some plates and glasses on the floor, we didn't think much of it but when we came back later that night they were still there. This place has crappy maintenance. . I'm definitely NEVER coming back here.
Very pleased with our recent stay here. The room was comfortable and affordable. It featured a huge tub and everything had a modern look to it. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. The location made it quick and convenient to get off the strip. We even squeezed in a show and ate here as well. We received discounts on both due to staying in the hotel. We will definitely be coming back.
Casino is kind of "tight" but the view from the top of the tower is awesome! Highly recommend a tour of the tower at night.
The rooms are ugly, looks like an old motel room. I'm very annoyed and upset. The sink is out in the open with the room. No privacy.  It's just awful,  I will be posting pictures.  I'm very honest with all my reviews.  I was able to pay extra for an upgrade but some people were getting upgraded rooms for much less.
Only stayed one night, staff was friendly, and very helpful! The room was very clean, ac worked great! My only complaint is the shower head was full of hard water deposits. So no flow through the head.
So this was my first time staying in Vegas. I didn't know what to expect. I read some reviews and the price was decent so I chose this hotel. Well I hope my review finds 1st timers well to learn this lesson... . 1- This hotel is literally at the END of the strip. Definitely not in comfortable walking distance to the fun hotels. (Bellagio, Planet Hollywood any of them). There is a bus stop about 4 blocks down that you can get a pass for which will take you down the strip. That is your best bet because the lights are about 5 minutes long and taxis will start to add up. The downfall with this bus is later at night they get PACKED! Im talking filled to the brim and people being drunk will argue to get on and there are just a bunch of drunk fools. Oh ya, like others have said.. bums pretty much all over the stratosphere area and people hounding you to buy things. It wasn't what I expected at all.. . 2- We showed up a couple hours before check in. They front desk was nice and "upgraded" us for $75 dollars. What they didn't tell me was that there was also an early check in fee so that was a surprise. I wasn't much but they should still tell me before they charge anything additional. The reason upgraded is in quotations is because the room was exactly as described to the original room I requested. The bath was slightly bigger but I wouldn't even use it because it wasn't the cleanest AND the shower was awful. Talk about NO water pressure. Being a female I just couldn't get the conditioner out of my hair Im not even exaggerating. And there was like no lighting in this bathroom I could barley see while showering. Oh ya, this "upgraded" room was said to have a great view.. not at all I got the view of the top of bottom building which had a porter potty, and wires and crap everywhere. I was so upset. . . 3- Request a non-smoking room, definitely smelled like smoke the second I opened up the door. I am a non smoker and can tell the difference big time.. . 4- The price is ok, but totally not worth it for the hassle. Pay the extra per night and stay at a hotel in the middle of everything. I would go to the stratosphere to visit just the tower. (But if youre not a guest you have to pay $16 entry fee and if I weren't able to get in for free I probably wouldn't bother). . 5- I called to speak with a manager or supervisor about my problems with the rooms.. the view, the bathroom, how this upgrade was a sham and he could care less. I would never do any business here again. I would have at least expected him to sound like he cared but no, he could care less and was so eager to get off the phone with me. So upset with this hotel.. . 6- At 7am we went down for breakfast. This place was suppose to be open 24/7. At 7am they were closed and sent us to the buffet. The buffet was closed and still had dinner out from the night before. There was NO food available for breakfast this day.. how is that even possible?! We went to Ihop 2 blocks down the street and it was the best food I had. The place Roxys was alright. The Italian food there I just wasn't impressed with.
Arriving at the Stratosphere, we immediately smelled the old smoke smell and were not impressed with the over 30 minute wait to register after being on airplanes and shuttles, only to get to the room and NO Wifi! So we decided to call the front desk whereby we were on hold for another 10mins (?!!!Seriously?) At first glance the room isn't bad, but when you actually look - it is. The air conditioner worked but looked all busted up. Half of it was hanging off! The bathroom linoleum was peeling away from the wall & oh ---if you want to turn on the light in the bathroom it would flicker for a few seconds like in a Horror film, then it gave off this eerie yellow glow....ick. You can't sit on the toilet & open the door, it's one or the other.. . As for the area of town - yes, it's on the bad end, yes there are pawn shops and bums around but I never felt unsafe. There's a Denny's right behind it and the service and staff there were TERRIFIC and the food was affordable! . . Too bad the Stratosphere staff never mentioned to us that there is a mall upstairs that includes a McDonalds....but then how would they make their money on their buffet. Oh that brings me to the buffet - we got scolded for not sitting and waiting for the non-existent server to bring us drinks before we ate. (This was the first night after arriving from flights, shuttles, the 30min registration lineup, now we were supposed to wait to eat, so that you get around to serving us? Me thinks not!). . Stratosphere gets 1 star because the water in the shower is HOT and when you take a bath it's HOT and my sore muscles loved it.. . That's the only good thing I can say about that place, good luck!!
First, I do not normally write reviews on Yelp of anything, I am pretty busy so that I am writing a review at all shows how bad this place is.. . Let me start by saying I wish I could give it zero stars and then explain why.. . First off, the hotel is north of the majority of the rest of the strip, so you won't be walking to the rest of the strip from here. If you try you will find that you are walking past very run down ghetto-like part of Vegas filled with ghetto people. Not fun.. . Next the hotel itself while it looks nice from the outside, and the lobby looks decent, when you get to your room the fun will begin.. . My friends had one room and I stayed in another room with a friend. Between our two rooms: toilets did not flush very well, ours got clogged. My friend's room key did not work and was never properly fixed. We stayed there 2 nights. Our room did not get cleaned on the only full day we were there even tho when we left our room the cleaning staff was cleaning other rooms close to ours in the same hallway.. . The table in the room, the only table you could put a computer on or anything else was horribly unstable and I would not trust putting anything on it at all, not even my elbow let alone a computer.. . Towels would make Motel 6 embarrassed they were so tiny and rough and not worthy of any decent hotel.. . The overprice $20 buffet was atrocious.. . I did not go on the main attraction some ride you can go on if you are not afraid of heights, so I can't comment on that. But if the only reason you plan to stay at this hotel is for that, then just stay at another hotel and go on the ride, skip the lodging.. . In short, the hotel was not just bad it was terrible. Food bad. Skip this hotel. Las Vegas has many world class Casinos and Hotels. This is not one of them.. . I am not sure I would stay here again even if it was free. Life is too short.
This is the worst hotel I have been to.  Please, please don't ever waste your money.  You deserve to be in the best place.  . The room given to us was not the one we expected.  It smelled like cigarette butts all over the place.  The air conditioner was not working well and maintenance said they will change it but will be messy for about 2 hours.  There was no more available room for us to switch.  The carpet was so dirty.  Sheets have holes and rips in it.  Bathroom was so small you could hardly move once you're in it.  Front desk people were so rude that you were still saying something on the phone and they will hang up on you right away.  The towels were old and needs to be changed, lots of rips.. Again, I could say a lot more but I will try to be short.  This is not the place to be for a pleasure trip.  I was with my boys and my Mom for a short stay but we didn't enjoy.  We have to go to different hotels just to eat. . PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY STAYING IN THIS HOTEL.  . I will rate this as a negative star!
This hotel is a great value. The rooms are well maintained. The pool area carries a fun vibe and is 8 floors up so it has a view. Roxys restaurant and Tower Pizzeria are worth trying! Of course the Tower itself has some great views so while youre up there try Level 107 bar!!!
I'm a local and today I went to the pool the chairs were out dated and the pool is not heated. But the service was great pitchers  are only $22 which is a great price. Unlike other hotels this place loves locals. I would have lunch here next time and more drinks.
It was our 1st time in Vegas and we booked sort of last minute. This seemed like a good deal. I figured we wouldn't be in the hotel much so it wouldn't matter. Well.....it did. It was awful. . Where do I begin. The shuttle from the airport forgot we were there so he dropped us off last but at least we got a tour I guess. After a long, hot ride we figured paying for early check in was worth it. We booked a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor...the room reeked of cigs. Went to the front desk to ask for a diff room. The "manager" didn't even look up at me while i was talking or apologize for it. He handed me a different key and walked away. Really??? I was livid when I got upstairs and the key didn't work. Room service was nice enough to let us in since we had a baby with us. As we were settling in a woman walked in with a key that worked. They gave her the same room. OMG. It was just a mess! . By that time we were starving but still had to get a room with a key that worked. We waited for a long time at the front desk and finally they let us stay in the room we were already in. Had to ask them to refund the early check in fee. They did not offer us any compensation for our troubles. Horrible customer service. Actually everyone that worked there was rude and unwelcoming. . After that whole mix up we went to eat in the hotel because we were too hungry to go anywhere else and Roxy's diner was pretty bad.....we waited a long time to order and the food was bland...fries were old...service was dead. We were ready to leave Vegas at that point. Our trip got a little better later but this hotel is horrible. Our bathroom light went out twice and they took really long to address it. It was 11pm they finally showed up. The casino is really smokey. The only good thing was starbucks in the hotel.If there is a next time we will be staying at a different hotel even if we have to pay double.
I got a REALLY great deal through Hotwire so I really couldn't pass it up ($300 per person for airfare & hotel). We got a smoking room because we requested a room with a mini fridge but they didn't charge us to upgrade. The hotdog place here is realllly good, also ate breakfast at Roxy's diner & it was very tasty and FAST, our food came only about 5 min after ordering! You get free tower access which is cool, and the 8 bar at the pool makes a variety of amazing mojitos. It is at the far end of the strip so you can't walk many places, but a 24 hr bus pass is only $8 or $20 for 3 day pass so it's really no big deal.  The neighborhood between here and Fremont street is pretty shady but I'm not a pretentious snob so I don't care, it's really no different than any other major city. And yes there are (wait for it) bums, it's Vegas dumb dumb, there are homeless people EVERYWHERE you go in Vegas, not just around stratosphere. We did meet 2 ladies who claimed they found bedbugs in their room & got switched so we promptly tore our bed apart when we got back but we found no sign of bedbugs and our mattress and sheets all look pretty brand new... Maybe higher levels are less likely to get infested? But there are reports of bedbugs even at the nicer hotels like Bellagio so I suggest checking your bed at ALL hotels you stay in. I would definitely stay here again for the price, save my money for shows & gambling!
We didn't stay here so I can't review the hotel rooms and such. However, we did come here to play and we're kind of disappointed. The casino floor was small and if it weren't for the rides I don't think I would've even consider coming here. That's where I kind of lost it. We pay to get on the Insanity, waited about 45 minutes and once we get to the Observation tower we're told that due to the intense winds the ride was shut down for evening. I understand the security concerns, but it was a bit rude the way they handled everything. . . "Yeah, go get a refund." . . The lack of communication between staff created a bottleneck downstairs in the ticket booth. There was only one cashier issuing refunds, which made the situation even more stressful. Once I was at the counter, the cashier was yelling into a phone for help. All I could say was, "It's going to get better."  She was nice to me and issued a full refund. Perhaps this is one of the things that the Stratosphere needs to work on. The Starbucks downstairs was overpriced and the live music was the only thing that was memorable.
