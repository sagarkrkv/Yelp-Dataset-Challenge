The food was just ok. The people seemed very a loof and not too professional. I do not even remember what I ate but there was a wait. Nothing special and crowded in.
Great food and service, we will be back.
Simply delicious. I had the Classique steak and a cocktail, both were absolutely delicious. I tasted some kind of soup (artichoke? asparagus? I can't remember...) from my friend and it was also delicious. The baguette they give you was crispy and chewy and also delicious. Everything was just delicious!. . In the end I spent about $50 on my meal and was completely stuffed. This is the perfect place to come when you want to be pampered but not spend $100+ per person. Service was absolutely excellent and sitting in the patio on the strip was fun and surprisingly not gross and distracting as I thought it might be.
I liked the overall French feel of this place. We sat indoors, I'm sure the experience would have been better on the patio. The food was mediocre. I would go there again to hang out and sip a latte, not for a real meal.
I was on the banks of the River Seine on my way to stroll down the Champs de Elysee... (insert needle scratch sound).... I had the butteriest of butters on fresh crackling bread, eggs, date covered bacon, and pommes de terre that were incredible. We had fabulous seating right on the strip and enjoyed people watching.  The waiters are very speedy and constantly in motion to provide service.  . I would return again!
My boyfriend now husband surprised me and took me here for my 28th birthday.  It was the perfect spot and so romantic especially with the view of Bellagio fountains.  We were seated right away and our waiter promptly took our drink order (he ordered a glass of champagne for both of us) Anyways my boyfriend ordered the steak bordelaise. I tried some and it was cooked to perfection and he devoured the whole thing.  I ordered more on the lighter side (Because he told me we were going eat somewhere else after) so I  just got the roasted root vegetables and the onion soup au gratin.  Both dishes were great.  I loved this place and had a wonderful time.
Love the outdoor atmosphere. Price was right, service exceptional and the food tasted fantastic
cool love it.
Now showing; A complete tourist trap. Oysters tiny, no discount for 1 dozen from 6. Mac and Cheese undercooked no matter how many times you ask for it to be done properly. This is the 2nd time in a row that I have received very poor intimidating "service" Don't mind paying for good food conveniently on the strip. That used to be the case; but not any longer. I + hour wait for patio, 45 minute withou reservation inside. In"N Out has better food and nicer kids.
Second visit to this restaurant. First time was with girlfriends, second time was with fiance.  Filet on first visit was out of this world.  Second visit: the duck confit app was divine.  The trout amandine was good but not great, as was the chicken paillard. Try the inexpensive rose wine.  With the duck, we were dying!
A huge thank you to Mon Ami Gabi for making our 7 year anniversary perfect!!!!!!. . This place is hopping, so don't dream about going without a reservation. There's still a line when you have a reservation, and you can't reserve the patio which looks onto the Bellagio fountains. . . They did a fabulous job of under promising and over delivering. We were 15 min early for our 8:00 reservation. Hostess said they were running 15 minutes behind. We tucked into the back bar, in the solarium (tres romantic!) and found two seats next to each other. Before we had our first sip the buzzer went off and we were whisked to a prime patio seat. The breeze was perfect, the outside temperate even more perfect, and the fountain shows - delightful. I wanted to stay all night!. . Service was prompt and kind with a smile - plus he had great timing instincts. We asked for a gluten free menu. A baguette was then delivered, and within 40 seconds a second bread delivery was made to my husband: gluten free option!  Can you imagine...just by asking for the GF menu, the waiter knew to order GF bread. What love. . . I made the mistake of skipping lunch, then being ravenous at 6:00 pm, and then gorging on Garrett's popcorn (cheddar carmel combo). So I wasn't really hungry for dinner.   We decided to order the raw-bar platter for two for $50, cold and refreshing. The best bits of it for me were the prepared lobster and the salmon/avocado tartar.  We joked that we'll never go back to Maine because now that someone has perfectly shelled and chilled our clawed crustacean it will never be the same with bibs. . . I said no to dessert, and then they brought us a treat for the anny anyway. So delicious, so thoughtful...cut Celine Dion hitting high notes as the water spouts above the skyline.  Perfection. . . -fin
Went here for breakfast but missed it by half an hour. Had to settle for their version of a french dip. Didn't care for it at all. Everyone raved about it on the reviews, but I didn't care for it at all.. . BREAKFAST IS WAY BETTER!!! THE EGGS BENEDICT IS AMAZING WITH THE CORN BEEF HASH!! BREAKFAST IS 5 STARS!
Very good restaurant that has quite a bit of choice and is cheap for las vegas standards. The outside tables are great but know that when making a reservation it is by request only. The restaurant is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and I've had dinner and breakfast there and it was excellent both times. It has a good feel and service was excellent as well. Great place for an visitor to dine out even on a budget.
Great view.  Don't expect to hear the music much though from the fountain show.. . Our server was fantastic and made sure that our meal was quick and yummy so we didn't miss our show.. . We got the goat cheese to start with and it was served with toasted garlic bread (Get this!) and I had the fish and fries and the BF had the steak. . . I don't think that the food was a 5 star so that's why it's a 4.  The service was fantastic though. . . I can see why it's popular!
Amazing crepes!  I had the ham and cheese crepe and it was sooo good.  Very rich and very filling.  They also have great salads and steak.  This is a go to place for me to take my clients each year for the various conferences that bring me to vegas.
Great breakfast made better by sitting outside.  Ate there 3 days in a row and did not have a bad experience.  Didn't eat at any other time, but was impressed enough by breakfast that I would imagine other meals would be great.  We had the 3 eggs scrambled, the ham and cheese omelet, croissants, the skinny pankcakes, french toast, bacon, and blueberry waffles.  I'd recommend them all - bacon is fabulous.  We should've stayed another day to try the eggs benedict.
Came here on Sunday with my friends for brunch to celebrate my bachelorette party and it was great! The service was fantastic and our waiter suggested the baked goat cheese for an appetizer and it was to die for! All of our food was fantastic and the experience overall was lovely.
Not as expensive as you'd think, especially for lunch.
Das Mon ami Gabi ist ein Pflichtbesuch bei jedem Las Vegas Urlaub! . Die Aussicht von der Terrasse auf die Bellagio Fountains ist einfach atemberaubend. Wir haben bis jetzt ubrigens nie reserviert. Beim Eingang bekamen wir meist einen Pieper und mussten uns dann 20 - 30 Minuten die Zeit vertreiben bis ein Tisch drauen frei war.. . Das Filet Mignon ist ein Traum - das Ambiente ebenfalls und die Bedienungen sehr hoflich!. . Ein tolles Restaurant-Erlebnis und uneingeschrankt zu empfehlen!
Yummy as always.  Diego from the var knows how to make my favorite cocktail, the Derby (with Bookers).. . Escargot good as always and the goat cheese is so incredible creamy and delicious.  Wow!. . I did ask for "Spanish Anchovies" ( white) on my salad, but got Chilean (brown) instead.  Big difference!  Please learn.. . Otherwise, an amazing grastronomical experience.. . Our waiter is amazing!
Great breakfast!  They even offer a gluten free eggs Benedict.  Fairly priced for Vegas.  Make sure you get a reservation.
Three stars for the managers fantastic attitude and the great view of the fountains. Otherwise they would get 1 star. (Only because I can't give 0). Three diners in our party. All ordered some version of steak fritte, roasted vegetables, sauteed mushrooms, and spinach. . All of the food was cold. All of it. So they replaced it... With cold food. . So we sent it back..  This time the manager said he'd personally ensure it was hot. Guess what. All of it was cold. Unbelievable..  Three free dinners.
I have had a few meals at Mon Ami Gabi and they were not good and way too pricey
Ive eatten at everyMon Ami, I love them all.  This is my favorite of the bunch.  We celebrated the Mrs birthday, sat outside for hours eatting and watching the belagio water show.  You've got to request outdoor seating for the free water show.  Escargo app along scallops and oysters for apps.   Bone in rib eye for our meals and sauteed spinach with loads of garlic.   Holler!!!!!    Don't forget to dip your baguettes in the escargo garlic butter.  Tremendous meal.  Incredible service. They sang to my beautiful wife happy birthday and made my sons and friends join in.  Gorgi was our waitress and there is none better.  Every suggestion she offered we took and she was spot on right.  She talked me out of my usual seafood crepe and was I ever glad to try something different.  Love the service.  Love the food. And dessert was bananas fosters crepes.  This is a place you can't just try once. You have to come several times.  Brunch is so so good.  The menu is perfect and then some !!!!
I very much enjoyed my experience at Mon Ami Gabi!. . First off, I have to say it is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas for ambiance alone. The indoor/ outdoor patio has monolithic glass windows adorned with radiant natural light. It is beautiful inside...The French bread is warm, authentic and brought immediately to the table... The restaurant is a bit over priced in my taste, but when you want a lovely place for lunch or brunch, it's worth the higher cost.  I very much enjoyed my French mussels and Belgian beer..  along with some delicious coffee to get the day going... : ) . . Great for special occasions or bringing your parents.  The indoor/outdoor patio also a nice view of the strip where you can watch all the tourists go by.
Fantastic service. Okay portion vs cost. Recommend sitting outside next to Las Vegas blvd. the croissant sandwich was delicious.
Food was okay, but too pricey for my like.
Food is average but you can't beat the people watching. Make sure you get a table on the patio close to the rail.
Had breakfast here.  Great location.  Great, yummy food.  Nice Gluten-free selection.  I would have expected their coffee to be better though.  Great people watching.  You can also see the Bellagio fountains from the patio.  Super friendly service, unlike the real Paris.  Highly recommend.
We had a beautiful table across from the Bellagio Fountains.. . The food was good...but we went specifically for the escargots, and they were small and just so-so.  . . Otherwise, all was ok....a bit pricey!
Tucked into Paris casino, Mon Ami Gabi serves delicious French-style food in an surprisingly elegant atmosphere. It certainly adds significantly to the French atmosphere of the casino. We were in town for my stepson's wedding & his uncle Jay hosted a lovely family dinner at this charming restaurant.. We started with Escargot all around the table. Tender & beautifully prepared with butter & garlic, the likes of these snails are rarely found & everyone seemed to enjoy them very much. Delicious bread & butter was also served with our appetizer & replenished throughout our meal. Our host's wine choice this evening was Cotes du Rhone, an excellent offering & the perfect choice to accompany our appetizer & steaks.. As a fan of pepper, I could not resist Steak au poivre, which turned out to be the most popular order in our group. A few of our people ordered Steak Roquefort & Steak classique, and every one of us was pleased with our choices. Our steaks were served with classic Pommes Frites, Belgian-style french fries.. Enjoying my steak cooked rare-medium rare, I'm always afraid that it will be overcooked, but these fine chefs delivered a perfectly rare Steak au poivre - exactly as I ordered. Very delicious, worthy of savoring slowly, and the total effect of atmosphere, the wine, and high quality food was akin to a mystical experience, like a brief sojourn into a lovely dreamworld!. We shared Creme Brulee & Creme Puffs for dessert. Both finely done & perfect postludes to the entire show.. Our only glitches were quite minor.  The street-view dining room was quite chilly, which made our ladies a bit uncomfortable. If this concerns you, I suggest trying another area of the restaurant on your visit. Otherwise, our waiter was not certain which guest was to get each dish, a typical problem that should be expected in a large dining party that orders very similar items. These are not enough to keep us from returning - in fact, we look forward to it!
We came to this restaurant for breakfast because it had outdoor terrace seating.  Best breakfast we had in Las Vegas.   Eggs Benedict are out of this world.  Even the daily special eggs Benedict are awesome.....same sauce, different creative toppings.  The French pancakes (more like glorified crepes) were awesome.  Haven't enjoyed breakfast like this in a very long time.  Service was impeccable.  Fresh squeezed oj was awesome.  We enjoyed breakfast so much we came back again for breakfast and dinner.   Bartender Mike S (who bartends at the terrace bar) is one hell of a bartender.  My wife asked for his recommendation.  and he made her a jalapeno Martina that is second to none.  Awesome restaurant.   Awesome service.   Awesome food.  Highly highly recommended.  Don't come to Vegas without coming here!!!!
Food was DELICIOUS! The White Chocolate Bread Pudding was AMAZING! We had an amazing waiter who was ATTENTIVE! View of the Bellagio fountains was AWESOME! Could not have asked for anything more!
We were looking for a quick bite to eat before heading home and through some yelping my friends discovered Mon Ami Gabi. We ordered some mimosas to start, they were good but it tasted like there was 0 alcohol in it :/ I ordered the salmon eggs benedict, it was very satisfying~ but nothing I can't find at any brunch spot in la. I tried some of my friends seafood crepe, never tried a seafood crepe but it was pretty good. The food was good, nothing special, it was good to just try. But I do like the ambience and decor of the restaurant. Maybe it's better for dinner than brunch.
Always the best service, food, and atmosphere. Period.
Great service, got the seafood crepe and a glass of champagne, really love this spot! Beautiful view of the strip.
This place is fantastic. The food, the service, the location right in front of the Bellagio fountains. I cannnot reccomend it enough.
I enjoyed my breakfast here! Went here for breakfast w/ my mom and GF, and we were VERY PLEASED with the selection. It is on the expensive side for breakfast....yes I know its Vegas. We ended up spending about $80. . . The location was ideal (at the food of Paris hotel...shocking I know LOL), where we sat was killer....outside....highly recommended for breakfast.. . Food - I had the Smoke Lox Eggs Benedict.....Delicious!! My mom and GF had the special which was a spinach and tomato eggs benedict, they were signing its praises all day long. Oh also, fun fact....they make their own English Muffins.....need I say more?! We also split the lemon pancake (probably NOT the real name of the dish), and it was very flavorful. Plus the pancake is a crepe style...which only made it that more delicious. On the menu they had a Nutella and Banana pancake...how I couldn't convince my mom and GF to get that I will never know. The coffee was pretty good as well.. . Staff - Nice, friendly, fast. They were busy and checked in on us every once in awhile. It wasn't the type of place where you need a lot of attention. You just sit back enjoy some coffee, people watch, and have a great breakfast. The staff seemed to understand that which was nice. . . Ambiance - It really did feel like a Parisian Cafe. The decor was very nice and even the coffee cups gave me the illusion that I actually was sitting at the base of the Eiffel Tower enjoying breakfast.
They said there would be a mimosa bar.  There wasn't.
The service was great here and it was decent French-esque food. The inside is dark and candlelit. Try to get a patio seat if possible. We weren't able to. . . First, the good: omg the baked goat cheese. OMG THE GOAT CHEESE. The cheese was warm, soft, and served swimming in tomato sauce. It was served with warm garlic bread, and my biggest joy in life is garlic bread dripping with cheese and delicious sauce. It was a little bit of nirvana for dinner. Unfortunately, it maybe set the bar a little high for the rest of the meal, because it didn't live up to the first course. . . We also had the warm brie. I love a cheese plate served with hazelnuts, so that was the high point. Unfortunately, the croutons were dry and hard. I ended up skipping the croutons it came with and eating regular bread with it, and enjoyed that more. . . I had the half portion of mussels and the frites. I didn't love the frites because they were hard and overly crunchy with no real potato in them. I dug around in the basket to see if there were better ones, but nope. All overcooked and shriveled. Even dipped in the broth from my mussels, they were a difficult, flavorless side, and I didn't eat many of them. The mussels themselves were pretty good, and it was served in a basic, lemony wine sauce. . . Mon Ami Gabi bills itself as a steakhouse, and several people in our party did get steaks and they enjoyed them. I didn't try it, so I can't speak to those, but maybe they're more proficient at their main attraction. . . We were celebrating a couple of birthdays, so they served Profiteroles with sparkler candles. They were festive, but not incredibly delicious. Then again, I always have high expectations for French pastry, and maybe that's not fair for a place sitting literally in the shadow of a replica Eiffel Tower on the Vegas strip. However, it was pricey enough to expect better food than we got. . . My advice? Come and gorge on cheese, bread, and wine. Do as the French do and your meal will be more satisfying.
I think this place used to be great.  Now, I feel like it's alright.  There's a lot of hype for big pieces of steak which I'm just not that into anymore. My food was undercooked and my mom's was waay to well done. Overall good atmosphere, although they try to maximize their customers and cram everyone into tight spots.
Love the excellent French food and great service.
Service here is awesome. I had originally made reservations for 8:15 after being told 7:30 was unavailable. We got hungry so I got there at 7 and asked them what the wait time was. The response was 45 minutes to one hour for a party of two. I let them know that that was fine and I had reservations at 8:15, so I would take whichever availability came first. The hostess then said that since I had reservations, they would take me right away because it would be unfair for me to wait. I told her we would be staying at Paris anyway so it really was fine, but she insisted and we didn't wait at all! The waitstaff is also courteous and well-spoken. Food came promptly and warm. I couldn't have asked for better service.. . Breakfast: . . Special eggs benedict: consisted of bacon, spinach, and tomatoes with a side of hash browns. I didn't think it was all that special. It was good/okay, but nothing outstanding. The english muffins were very... toasted and a bit difficult to bite into. There was very little spinach and only a small piece of bacon. I think it was one bacon slice for the entire plate. The hollandaise sauce was bland and seemed watered down. The hash browns were good, however it was salted unevenly so we got little pockets of salt here and there.. . Mushroom omelette with egg whites instead - consisted of mushrooms and brie cheese with hash browns and a slice of toast. Omelettes don't usually wow me since it's such an easy breakfast item to make. They didn't skimp on the brie although the brie wasn't a strong one. It was okay. I did like their bread though.. . Dinner:. . Dinner starts out with a warm baguette served with butter and a small pickled shredded root vegetable "salad".  Last year it was carrots, this year it was jicama.. . Filet mignon merlot - The filet came out really fast this time. I would say our food came out within 15 - 20 minutes of ordering. The filets were ordered medium well and they were cooked perfectly with a nice seared crust. The potatoes came warm and perfectly salted and crisp.. . Vegetable Farcis (last year) - It was so flavorful and bursting with flavors I didn't feel I was missing out on anything. I hadn't been that excited about vegetables for awhile. I was very impressed with a steakhouse creating such a unique vegetarian dish. It consisted of herbed quinoa on a bed of sauteed tomato/sauce and topped with grilled zucchini, squash, and eggplant. Some of the vegetables had a creamy stuffing that was pretty decadent.. . Bananas Foster Crepe - The caramel sauce is sweet and nutty with the bananas perfectly sauteed to remain firm, yet have that nice cooked banana flavor. One mistake I find many places make when making bananas foster is overcooking the bananas to mush. I don't think I detected any rum; the caramel is very strong so if there was any rum, maybe it brought out the caramel flavors. The crepe batter they use yields a nice thin, slightly chewy crepe. I'm not one to favor the crispy type crepes so this was perfect. Inside the crepe is vanilla ice cream and on top is a dollop of whipped cream.. . Star items - filet mignon merlot, bananas foster crepe.
Steak frites .... . Frites = chips. Steak ... Extra plat mal cuit mal assaisonne ... Deception . Heureusement pain et beurre pour faire patienter. Le seul detour de ce restaurant est la terrasse avec vue sur les fontaines du bellagio . Trop cher pour ce que c'est
We have been to Mon Ami Gabe ' 5 times now.That should say something. The food is above good and the service is always great. See you next year.
Really great bistro style place in the Paris Casino.  It's on the medium side of pricey for vegas, but worth it.  We went for brunch after lounging at the pool all morning.  I had the bacon, egg, and cheese crepe and a side of fruit.  My wife had a quiche that was both good and enormous (we probably could have shared it).  My crepe was excellent.  The crepe was light and yummy, and the fillings were savory.  Normally, I don't expect much when I order fruit at a restaurant, but all the fruit were ripe and perfect as well.  (I'm so used to getting rock hard cantaloupe at other places!)  Service was really good too.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.. . If you are near Paris, I would definitely recommend this place.  I want to come back and try their steak frites one day.  I would also definitely recommend this restaurant over Ile St. Louis on the other side of the Paris Casino.  The breakfast crepe that I got there was dry and tasteless.
Went here for breakfast which was wonderful!  Was a bit disappointed because we had read that it was across from the Bellagio fountains which it was, but they were not on.  That would have been even more incredible, but they don't start until 11am.  We were going to wait for a table outside, but noticed the enclosed patio/bar area was quite lovely and it was a bit windy, so we ate there by a window.  We split the eggs benedict which was on a homemade english muffin that was really good.  We then split the bananas foster waffle which was out of this world awesome!  The crisp waffle with bananas and that incredible warm, bananas foster syrup with the cool homemade whipped cream was beyond words!!!  . The only somewhat negative was our waitress was a little snooty... maybe that's the french way, although she wasn't french. Lol!  The other places we had been to in Vegas, the people were so kind and fun, so we had been used to that.  Would highly recommend this place and also the bananas foster waffle, though.  Also, wanted to mention there's a bloody mary bar which we didn't try, but it sounded interesting.
I don't know. I would call the place mediocre. Definitely not more than 3 stars. We had to ask 2 times for a straw. Than they told us that the chicken pate was not available. My co worker received the onion soup 10 minutes before my appetizer finally made it. I just was able to speed up enough and finish my last bite before the main course arrived. The fries were way too salty. They waiter never asked how we like the food or if I would like to have another beer. They really try to rush you in order to make place for the next guest. Not a very enjoyable dinner. They won't see me again. There are way better choices around.
Since my travel companion and I were the only people dysfunctional enough to be wide awake (and starving) at 7am on the Las Vegas Strip, we decided to take advantage of the situation and have a power-breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi -- a spot that's notorious for endless lines andwaits for those foolish enough to show up without a reservation.. . My instinct was right:  At 7am on Saturday morning, the restaurant was empty, and the two of us had our choice of tables with no need for reservations or waiting.  It also helped that the morning was glorious -- 70F, a gentle breeze, and perfect for leisurely meal on Mon Ami Gabi's sprawling patio, right on the Strip and across from Lake Bellagio.  (Sadly, the fountain show isn't running at 7am, but there's always abundant people-watching.). . I'm not a caffeine person, but mornings in Vegas require it.  A pot of black tea for me and endless refills of black coffee for my guest were just what the doctor ordered.. . The portions at Mon Ami Gabi are behemoth, so we knew that one small plate and one regular plate would be more than enough food.  We started with the fruit salad with brown sugar and yogurt, which was simple but fresh and tasty.  We also shared the turkey and egg white omelet, which is served with toast (+ butter and jam), hash brown, cherry tomatoes, and avocado.  The omelet was certainly pretty to look at, but a bit bland.  It needed pepper, or hot sauce, or something to give it a little kick.. . The real winner, surprisingly, was the hash brown.  I don't think I've ever had one so crispy and flavorful.  I say this as someone who normally shies away from heavy, carb-laden breakfasts.. . Service at Mon Ami Gabi is....typical Vegas.  Stiff and not especially friendly.  I don't  expect much else at a restaurant that probably gets zero regulars.. . That said, I think I know exactly where I'm headed next time I need a tasty, healthy, and relatively affordable breakfast on the Strip!  =)
Pleased with gluten-free options.  Four gluten-free dessert choices! Lovely restaurant with nice atmosphere.
Loved it! We made a reservation and were seated right away. I love that you enter from the casino but then it's like you're in your own little world. Quiet and cozy, with beautiful decor, you instantly relax - the perfect escape before you head back out into the craziness of Vegas.. . I ordered probably the best soup I've ever had, a creamy pea and leek special, and our table shared the ricotta and olive tapenade appetizer. I had an endive salad, my friend had the vegetarian dish with goat-cheese stuffed vegetables and her husband had steak. All great.. . I notice they have a big patio outside, too, which would be a totally different experience and an awesome place to sit during the day for wine and lunch.
I Love Love Love Love Love this Place!!!!!. In 2007 my Beloved Mom, age 90 and in a wheel chair came for the month of December....I would go to Bellagio and get her the wheel chair from there and then take her across the Blvd to Mon Ami Gabi...we would go almost every evening and sit outside by the Heaters and dine so she could watch the Fountains....her appetite was not that great however when we dined there she was bottomless!!!! We did this for 7 weeks...she Loved it and the Staff there got to know and Love her...They were so kind, Loving and Gracious to her!!!!  Friendly...Patient...She Loved it and I Loved the way they Loved her...People who REALLY CARED about their customers and add to that the BEST FOOD ON THE STRIP!!!!!  Why go any other place...She has passed and I continually go there...I live in Vegas and I take everyone that is visiting there or recommend it to others.....So, If you want GREAT FOOD and a Staff that truly cares about your dining experience PLEASE go there....you will not be disappointed...
Went here several times for breakfast during my Vegas stay because the menu is full of amazing foods and I had to come back to try more! Never disappointed. Stayed outside. During my first visit the staff could have been friendlier, but never had that same problem any of the other times I went.
I have to knock off a star bc of the wait time for the patio.  We have been here numerous times, and I know the patio doesn't take reservations. But a 1 & 1/2 hour wait at 5:30 is a little crazy.. That being said, the food is always amazing! I usually get some sort of steak, and hubby gets either the skate or some sort of braised short ribs.  Never had a bad waiter or bad food here. . Bottom line, if you want the patio (and the people watching is second to none), expect a wait. It would be better if they could text you when your table was ready, as the sensors only work a short distance in the casino. But the food is worth the wait
Man I really wanted to like this place. It had great reviews but I was pretty disappointed. The ambiance was nice. It mimics a small 1920's Parisian cafe underneath the Eiffel Tower statue at the Paris Hotel. It is crowded and busy inside the restaurant with small tables nestled tightly together. . . We ordered one of the steak frites and the mussels to share. The mussels came out first and that was amazing. If I only had that dish, I would've given this restaurant 4 stars. But then the steak frites came and the meat was thin, gritty, overdone, tasteless. It was overall inedible and a sad piece for over $40. I would never ever ever get that again. . . Service was also terrible. The waiter disappeared for long period of time between asking for drinks, taking our order, delivering food and waiting around for the check. We were just about ready to just ditch the place. . . Probably not gonna try this again.
We had a bunch of friends meet at this restaurant to eat. . . I was really excited to plan a work get together. The place is very elegant with a lot of charm. It is next to the belagio water fountain. I personally had my back to it but that was ok. We all had a good time.. . . Food Many of us had seafood had really had a great experience. The fish was fresh and not overcooked. . Some had scallops and was not bad .. . We did not order drink but I bet it have been greeat. . The atmosphere was chic and it could definitely could be a romantic spot. . . Honestly the food was very reasonable with most dishes 30-$40. . All the guests were happy .
Mon ami Gabi was really pretty good and didn't break the bank. We wanted to grab a quick bite late afternoon so a colleague suggested to stop by here. Fantastic view if the Bellagio fountains from the patio and outside.. . The ham and cheese crepe was light and perfectly prepared. The hollandaise was great and served to the side of the crepe so as to not smother it. Service was also great but the hostess was a bit snooty.. . While waiting for a friend I ordered a croissant and cup of coffee. I will say that it was one of the best croissants I have ever had. Crispy, buttery, soft inside and was a perfect match for the French roast.
Holey Moley!  Went back a year later.  Thank Mandy for great service (a fifteen year veteran - doesn't look it).  Can't believe I had the same meal again - just felt it - even to the wine and it was wonderful!  Okay - I had a martini this time as well.  I'm afraid to try the one in Reston because I loved my two experiences in Vegas so much.
Service was great, outdoor patio ist pretty nice. We had filet mignon which was great and worth 4 stars. Unfortunately my vegetable farcis was not good at all (overcooked, far too many onions and almost no quinoa) and really too expensive ($20) for the poor quality. I would really give 0 stars for the vegetable farcis.
The food was great and the server was very friendly and attentive.
Mon Ami Gabi is a nice little place located right in front of the Bellagio under the eiffel tower.  The interior is decorated with beautiful, dark wood that mimics Parisian cafes.. . It is perfect for brunch. We went a little before ten and we're thrown off by the huge line in front of the restaurant. But the line moved very fast and in a short minute or two we were at the front. The outside seating was full but they sat us inside right away. . . The eggs benedict was deliciously crafted.  The muffin was crunchy on the outside, giving the dish an interesting texture. The waffles my sister had were also just as delicious: sweet and decadent!. . For brunch,  the prices were completely do-able compared to other places in Vegas (40$ breakfast, I think not) and the food/ambiance were very nice!
Eating in Vegas can often feel like you are eating at a restaurant in Disneyland; the atmosphere is phony and the food is cranked out like an assembly line to handle the traffic.  Mon Ami Gabi is just like that.  . . We wanted to treat ourselves to an expensive meal that included excellent steaks.  The restaurant was very crowded on a Saturday night but we didn't have to wait too long for a table.  The place is very well decorated and our waiter was cordial and friendly, though there did not appear to be any attempt to develop a convivial relationship with our table.  He got the order quickly, made it arrive, and delivered a check.  More than satisfactory if I was at a Marie Calendar's, not what I expected when I was spending over $150 for 3 people.. . We ordered our steaks and settled in since, I assumed, they would take about 15 minutes to be prepared and cooked properly.  They arrived 6 minutes later.  They were thin pieces of meat, so thin that it was impossible to know if mine was medium-rare or well-done.  It seems all they do is have a conveyer belt of steaks that they cook, throw onto a plate, and pour the sauce on top.  We were in and out after about 20 - 25 minutes.. . If you just want a meal without any fanfare and don't care about service, I'd recommend this place.  But for the price, it really fell flat in providing any kind of upscale service or meals that you will remember.  It's Paris in Disneyland.
I wanted to love this place and I was excited to go here because half my group had gone before and they were looking forward to going back. By the end of the meal, there were very mixed reviews.. . Service: 3.5 stars (found ourselves waiting around a lot for service to show up again). . Soup: 4 stars (good, but not standout, carrot soup du jour). . Entree: 2.5 stars. I got the scallops and they were so, so salty, the mushrooms were bitter, and the squash puree was overly sweet. Couldn't finish it. I woke up at 5am to swollen fingers and desperate thirst. . . I had some of my cousin's wafer thin frites, and they were delicious! . . They get bonus points for having a gluten free menu and serving what we suspect is Udi's GF bread by request (with warm olives!).. . I won't be back but hopefully this will help you decide if you want to go!
I have mixed feelings about Mon Ami Gabi. The food was good but the service was beyond sub-par. I expected a lot better. We walked in for breakfast and were seated after a couple of minutes. We took a table inside to avoid the wait and the decor was nice but it felt cramped. People passing by were constantly bumping my chair. The server came out, brought us our waters and took our orders. Within a reasonable amount of time our food was out and boy was it delicious! I ordered the mushroom and cheese omelette (mushrooms, brie, chives) and my fiance ordered the ham and cheese omelet. We were very pleased with our meals, but that first glass of water that was brought out? Yeah that was the only one we got for the duration of our meal. I finished my glass half-way into my meal and kept expecting the guy filling waters to stop at our table. However, I watched him THREE times as he picked up a water pitcher, walked past our table, looked right at my empty glass and proceeded to give water to another table. And then he would walk back by our table to put the pitcher down. And repeat. THREE times, within about 10 minutes. And those were just the times I saw him do it. I tried motioning to him a couple of times but it's as if eh were intentionally ignoring us. It was incredibly inconsiderate. Furthermore, the waitress didn't bother to stop by once until she was ready to bring us our checks. At this point I was parched and asked for a water, which we didn't get until after we had paid. The food was good, but if I can't get something as simple as a refill of water and, even worse, feel as if I'm being ignored, I won't go back. Next time I go back to Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi will not be on my list of places to visit. Very poor service.
Nice place to take a date at a reasonable price.
So good we are here two nights in a row! This restaurant knows how to do it right from service to the food it's superb, especially when you consider the reasonable prices.. . We wanted to have a romanticdinner but still feel a part of the Vegas vibe and this place doesn't disappoint. . . Our table was outside in the back corner so it felt like we had the place to ourselves (even though the place is always packed)! Martin took our orders after giving excellent suggestions!. . The onion soup... Perfect light and flavorful. Entrees of steak Roquefort cooked perfectly. Topped off with dessert it was a wonderful night. Martin made sure everything came out perfectly timed and cooked to order.. . Best part of the evening getting to watch all of the people walking the strip and the view of the Bellagio fountains.. . If you want a romantic evening with great food and service without paying the Eiffle Tower prices this is your place! Will definitely be back.
There's a reason Mon Ami Gabi has over 3800 reviews and averages four stars. It really is that good. Definitely a worthwhile destination if you're looking for an excellent dinner on the Strip.. . Service is impeccable, especially if you're lucky enough to be seated in Michelle's section. She took excellent care of our large party of twelve, answering numerous menu questions, accommodating my gluten free needs, and keeping the food and drinks flowing freely throughout the evening. . . While my dining companions raved about the filet mignon with merlot butter, I opted to try their oysters, flown in fresh from the Pacific Northwest and served with both the traditional cocktail sauce and a great mignonette. These beauties were pristine little taste sensations of the sea. Once I offered to share with my colleagues, it became apparent we would need more. Michelle, once again, to the rescue!. . Mon Ami Gabi earned its fifth star by serving me fresh-from-the-oven gluten free bread, which I enjoyed along with the superb chicken liver pate. So traditionally French, and so amazingly delicious. (Don't worry, for  non-GF patrons, you get the normal, gluten-filled crusty baguettes.)
Two Las Vegas regulars recommended this place to my friends and I when we asked for a cute place to have lunch where we could sit outside.  Well, we put our name on the list to sit outside and the wait wasn't that long... but when we go to the table, boy oh boy, were we outside!  Smack in the Las Vegas heat and sun.  Strangely every other table was under an umbrella, except ours.  We couldn't do it.  So we asked to be moved inside.  Luckily, they had an indoor patio, which was still nice.  They were very accommodating, our server was a sweet lady.  She took excellent care of us!   We of course started with a pitcher of FRANgria!  You got that right... Frangria!  It was interesting... had a hint of Rosemary.  And they serve you a loaf of fresh warm french bread for the table.  So good!  We ordered the Brie as an appetizer, that was AMAZING!  Our lunch itself, it was okay.  The Kale salad I got, nothing spectacular, but it wasn't bad.   And the server was so sweet, she heard I was celebrating my bday so she brought out a little cream puff with a candle and had everyone sing for me.  Totally special and sweet!  The location of the restaurant is so nice, right on the strip across the street from the Bellagio fountains.  Right after lunch, we all stood outside and took a selfie in front of the "Eiffel Tower!"  Our little trip to Paris... on a budget of course!!!
Wonderful experience!. . Mon Ami Gabi was the best meal of our entire Las Vegas trip last week!  We were lucky because the morning we went, the temperature was about 70 degrees and made for a perfect day to sit outside and enjoy breakfast and people watching.  . I ordered the Bananas Foster Waffle and my wife ordered the Blueberry French Toast.  Both were perfect!  Servers were friendly and attentive.  Couldn't ask for a better way to start the day.
We came here for the view of the strip.  The ambiance was cool, very Parisian.  They told us we had a 15-20 minute wait, but our buzzer began buzzing within 5 minutes.  We went to the check in and there were 4 people working the check in counter, and it seemed nobody knew what to do.  They said, oh, two more minutes please.  (Then why did you buzz us?!) Two different people said, "Melissa, party of 4" while we stood directly in front of them and said Melissa, party of 4, yet it took another minute for someone to walk us to our seats outside.  It took some time to get served, and while 3 of us enjoyed our coffee once we ordered, it took at least 10 minutes for our fourth girl to get her cappuccino.  The menus were disgusting, covered in food, and one of the coffee cups had to be returned because it was dirty.  The menu was surprisingly filled with lots of options.  I had the eggs Benedict special which was just okay.  The eggs weren't juicy which is the whole part of eggs Benedict, the yolks were 3/4 of the way cooked.  My friend ordered the nutella waffles and seemed disappointed because the nutella was inside and pretty sparse.  Don't come here for the food, its just okay...come here for the people watching!
Some may call this a tourist trap in Vegas, but its reputation is based on merit and not hype! Expect beautiful Parisian decor, an inviting patio perfect for brunch and people watching, friendly staff and an incredible gluten free menu. . . They have a great selection of brunch cocktails, including a huge variety of champagne. . . We opted for lunch since it was around 11am. My friend got the Croque-Monsieur with frites and it was a huge, stacked portion covered in creamy bechamel. Yum! She couldn't finish it, so if you have a smaller appetite, consider sharing this rich delight. Each table also gets a freshly made french baguette which came out piping hot. I got the steak frites which was a grilled skirt steak with herb butter. There are multiple steak frites options but due to food allergies, I got the basics. It melted in my mouth and I ate every bite!. . Food allergy info:. Ask for a Gluten Free menu before being seated. They have a ton of options, including gluten free bread (has egg in it), french onion soup (with GF crouton!), the frites are pan fried in canola oil (no soy here! woo!) and plenty of egg dishes that are naturally GF. I let my server know about my allergies and he took care of me. Amazing experience!
Good people watching and consistently tasty food; nothing particularly special but they offer a well rounded meal. Average service, bonus points for affordable wine list.
Great service, always great food.  Every time we're in Vegas, we go there.
Extremely fast service; we got to sit outside right against the rail, and were able to watch the Bellagio fountains several times. Food was excellent, and the pricepoint is nothing to complain about.
Had breakfast there once. It was actually pretty good, nice environment.
For a restaurant on the strip, it's affordable.  And the steak is really good.  I didn't really want to have to write anything though.  It's good though!
Nice views of the Bellagio fountains from the patio if you don't mind looking past all of the Las Vegas Blvd. traffic. Food is okay and service was good. Best thing we had was the shrimp appetizer. All in all we weren't thoroughly impressed but it was an okay spot to go for lunch. I can see how tourists would like this place.
I'm not sure who our waitress was, but she was awesome, made the meal that much better! Seafood platter was the main dish, salmon tartar was exceptional. Also I got a ginger vodka cocktail that was AWESOME. No complaints here, French onion soup was good...most are toooo salty --good food, good service, awesome atmosphere!
This has been a go to place for my wife and I on our past several trips to Las Vegas. We have yet to make it there for anything but breakfast but reading other reviews it certainly is on my list for the next trip. (Which is coming up soon!). . Just after the early risers and before the strip starts to heat up, Mon Ami Gabi is just the perfect spot for breakfast. Sitting on the outdoor patio is just an amazing experience. You can sit in absolute comfort, the sun not at its peak and just enough shade to set the perfect temperature for breakfast. People watching at this time of day and from this wonderful vantage point has always been a highlight for my wife and I. We watch as the street performers start to show up to lay their claim and observe the Vegas newbies (no offense to those that have yet to visit) try to find a place to eat, thinking Mon Ami Gabi is too expensive. We used to think that as well but several trips back we just went for it and gave it a chance. We have never looked back. . . The service is amazing and you do really feel like you stepped out for a fine supper meal but this is just breakfast, right? Not in the least. The service is superior and the breakfast selections are great. While the food is prepared well, presented nicely and provides just the right start to the day it is the mood and atmosphere that really makes this place special. It may only be for the duration of your meal but for that brief time you are taken away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, transported away from the lights and sounds of the casinos and you are dropped into a calm oasis of fine food and service. Even some of the high end 4 or 5 star restaurants on the strip fail to offer that, failing to shield the dinerfrom the constant reminders of money lost on the slots or providing shade from the neon glow that draws entices us to follow. . . Yes the patio is on the strip but Mon Ami Gabi allows you to both be on the strip and miles away at the same time. . . Come for the food but take the time to break away from the pace of Vegas and enjoy this gem.  Reading other reviews it is clear that that there is more to this place than breakfast, so I am going to go back and give it a try, will you?
Hands down my favorite view on the strip. The patio offers a superb place to people watch and view the fountains at the Bellagio. The food is traditional French, They do a good job, which is no small task considering how many people they serve in a day. A nice assortment of entrees and a large wine list.
This restaurant will make you feel like you're in Par-reeee ;) . . Directly under the Eiffel Tower and across the street from the Bellagio, this is a must for tourists. I'm all for free shows, the view is AWESOME. My entourage and I sat outside so we got to see the fountain show which was really nice especially when we were stuffing our faces with fancy French food! . . The free bread was pretty good, haha. Plow through this and ask for more! The service wasn't bad, the nice man serving us had to deal with us changing tables halfway through but he was totally cool about it!. .  This place can get crazy crowded, make a reservation, it'll help! Well actually if you want to sit outside, it all depends on how busy they are. The day we went, I had a reservation but it didn't matter because we wanted to sit outside anyway. Cover your bases to ensure there's a table for your party. I think this was one of those places where I had to give them my credit card number to get a reservation, it's pretty serious haha! . . Food: I've had better French food in Seattle but I'm giving this place four stars for the experience. We all liked it very much, and despite everyone's different palettes, we were pleased with our dishes. I had the scallops, they were perfectly seared. The butternut squash was savory and complimented the scallops. It was around $25 for the dish, I thought it was fair. I also tried the escargot appetizer. I thought it was too oily, the snails were served in a pan with little circular slots. I think they were drizzled with a little bit of herb oil. I wouldn't order this again, but you can be the judge. The oil just made the snails unappealing, I've had escargot before but served in an actual sauce. I think that's a better way to cook them! . . Portions were generous. My friend ordered a salad and it was ginormous. All of us could have shared it, it looked good! My other friend ordered a sandwich and it came with a mountain of fries. Definitely a place where you could share if you wanted to! We walked all the way from Monte Carlo so we opted for our own and waddled our way back down the strip.
I cannot stop thinking about this place! I fell in love with Mona Mi Gabi! The ambiance of the restaurant is awesome! My eyes are extremely sensitive to sunlight, but here I didn't mind since I was so intrigued by the environment. The view is extremely nice since its across from the belagio and Caesars palace. I took my mother and sister for lunch and it was awesome!!. . I got the steak and frites (medium) and it was perfectly cooked! We also got the macaroni au gratin which was probably the best mac n cheese I've had. My sister is strict vegetarian. She said quote on quote, "I loved this dish so much that I'll drive here from Summerlin just to eat this." My mother is a big scallop advocate. She loved it as well. She also got the french onion soup which unfortunately she only ate a little bit since she needed something to eat right away -_- . . Max is bottom line the best server we've ever had! He was extremely polite and overall awesome! He took care of everything we needed. He is extremely aware of all his tables in which it seemed he had quite a few tables, yet he took care of everyone with great hospitality. Max keep up the great work boss!. . Ill soon be coming back to mona mi and eventually ill be a regular haha. My favorite restaurant yet haha!
Amazing place! Great views on the strip if you sit outside. The menu has great choices, don't be afraid to try the Escargot it's one of their signatures and almost every table had ordered it. Martinis do not disappoint. The inside ambiance is great for dates and late dinner. This place was a complete win - can't wait to revisit!
I can't say enough about the atmosphere of this place! Sitting on the patio offered us such a unique experience of the Vegas strip. Being able to watch the fountains of Bellagio while eating was sureal.
This place was awful!!! We had terrible service by a very unhappy over weight server. I had 4 scallops that were $25 and they were not as fresh as stated. My gf had a dried out choc muffin that not even milk could help the taste.
Great food, love the mushroom crepes.  The inside restaurant has a lovely atmosphere.  Dining outside is a perfect people watching experience as you are directly on Las Vegas Blvd, the only problem is in the summer it is so hot outside.
Flawless.  Waitstaff extremely helpful for those not familiar with some of the steak entree finishings.  Wide variety wine selection and staff is also well educated in appropriate wine pairings for each particular steak.  I agree with all the reviews that say this is not a true tourist trap.  If you skip this place, you've missed out on near perfection.  I would have rather eaten every dinner here than the two really crappy Mexican places my friends made me eat at.  (ie-don't waste your life on Cabo Wabo).
I came here for lunch, and it was very hot. But I sat outside, to enjoy the view. Usually umbrella provides shades, but my table was not covered by umbrella so sun heated up the table and my dishwares. But it was my choice to sit outside.. . I ordered seafood platter, sangria, scallop, and salad.. . The quantity is not huge, but quality is good. Shrimp, lobster, and scallop were memorably delicious.. . If sun does not attack you... Sit outside. I loved the ambience more than the food.
Breakfast here was amazing.  The view across to Bellagio and the fountains is very cool, and the food was amazing.  I had the apple and cinnamon crepes and my wife had eggs benedict.  It was all we could do not to walk over there every morning for breakfast while in Vegas.. . Also, get the cappuccino in a bowl.  It's huge and it's amazing.
Incredible. Amazing. Eat there, dammit! . . My review is based off of my visits circa 2008 in preparation for my Vegas wedding. The food was delicious (especially the creme brluee), the view is spectacular (you're looking right at the Bellagio fountains), and the ambiance is great. Yeah, it's pricey, but is is worth it.
Lovely nook in the Parisian hotel. The outdoor patio was quite nice, with French music in the background.. . We had breakfast there on our last day in Vegas. The service was alright. But the food was quite good. I had the bacon cheese and egg crepe ($15), Could have used some nice garnishing/spices, but did not disappoint.. . Hubby had the corned beef egg Benny ($15) really liked the rustic bread and strawberry jam. . . House blend Coffee was $4 per person, which appears standard on the strip. . Overall, a very good experience on the Strip on the warm weekday morning
This is a must for brunch it's sooooo good. I think this place definitely does its diligence for a quaint brunch or a delightful dinner. I will absolutely return and I can't wait.
Came here with my cousins! Definitely worth it!!
I really like this place.  The service is excellent.  We had a delay and the waiter was incredible.  The food is very good, not great but very good.  You patio is always good because you get to people watch and the Bellagio water show.  You should definitely go with the steaks but the ladies liked the fish a lot too.
Hands down the best seafood platter in the world!!!!. . Came here on Monday late morning and did not have to wait at all! The waitress led us to the sunroom which has an amazingly nice view of the Bellagio and its water show!. . We ordered the Seafood Platter, worrying that it might not be enough for both of us.It came with one Maine lobster, shrimp, salmon tartare, baguette chips, oyster, and three types of sauce (the mustard sauce was the best). Oh god, it was delicious! We ended up eating all of it and walked away with a big smile:). . Highly recommend this restaurant, and of course, their ***Seafood Platter***!!!
Long wait for the patio, but totally worth it! We were seated in about 45 mins on a busy Saturday afternoon right next to the busy street. . . The chairs and table gave a Parisian feel but the loud Vegas tourists (I'm one myself) made me remember I am still in the US. . . Service was extremely good and my water. Glass or al. . Food : we ordered the seafood tower cause I love seafood . The seafood was tasty and fresh on the tower. My favorite turned out to be the salmon ceviche, it had avocado and sesame oil. We also ordered The crab cake, I would skip this , had very minimal lump crab and too much breading for me.
I really enjoyed my breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi. Yes, it is overpriced, but it's Vegas so it's to be expected. The eggs benedict were a solid 4 and the date glazed bacon was incredible. . However, the service was horrid. Our waitress was just plain mean. Not rude, but mean. I even saw her scolding the bus boy for doing something that wasn't to her liking. Not appropriate in front of customers. . Other than that, I would definitely return on another trip to Vegas.
