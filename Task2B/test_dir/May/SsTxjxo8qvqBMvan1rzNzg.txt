Talk about blast from the past. Neon lights, weird floral arrangements and fake trees. So awesome. Such a great place to people watch after a long night out. . . We arrived after midnight and this was actually our first stop out in Vegas. We ordered a few drinks and appetizers. I had the shrimp cocktail which was really fresh and good with nice plump chilled shrimp. My husband ordered beer battered cheese sticks. They were crisp and fresh served with a side of marinara sauce.  . . I ordered the Key Lime pie martini, complete with a graham cracker rim. It was creamy, sweet and strong. Loved it! My husband had a huge Mai Tai and I actually laughed at him when it came out because it was a giant girly drink. It was also very strong and good. . . I wish we could have ordered some of the breakfast items but I wasn't too hungry. I really loved the atmosphere and the very 80's vibe they have going on in here. Such a fun place to dine and have drinks. Our waiter Jose was very attentive and nice. Our cocktail waitress was also very patient as we were taking forever to decided on what to order. We were given plenty of space to enjoy ourselves and just enough service to fulfill our needs.
Great food. Crowded, but they handle it very well. Give good estimates on wait. . They told us 25 minutes and it was around 22.. Only 4 stars because the food is good but a little over priced.. There $22 dollar steak is not really worth it. Close but not quiet.
Oh Peppermill, you will always have a place in my heart. This is me and my husbands favorite place in Vegas for breakfast or a late brunch. The food is always consistently good and the service is wonderful. The ladies that have been here for a while already know us by name. They make you feel so at home!
JACKPOT!  We've got a winner here. My friend INSISTED we stop by for breakfast. I've gotta say that I'm so glad he wouldn't let me leave Vegas until I did.. . Never in a million years would I compliment bad decorating, but I gotta say, "What a GROOVY place!"  The atmosphere definitely makes you feel like you just stepped back into the 1970's (or early 80's) Down-chicka-down-down.... . The wait was about 30 minutes, but it was worth it.. The tables were booths that felt like private coves.. Our waitress was really sweet, attentive and on top of everything.  I was amazed how she remembered all her tables with these tucked away cove-like booths.  (With all the mirrors and lights--it's definitely not a place where you can drink on the job!). . I ordered a salad and it was HUGE!. My husband had the egg white omelette and said it was great.. The coffee was fresh (We appreciated the large mugs, btw). The prices were a bit high for the diner atmosphere, but that wouldn't stop me from coming back.  Because, let's face it-- I've wasted my cash on worse experiences in this town!
The Fireside Lounge is a cool place to hang out. I was craving a Bloody Mary so we stopped in for some drinks. Their Bloody Mary's were pretty good! Definitely enjoyed the atmosphere to go with it. Watching 90's music videos by the fireside was pretty sweet too! . . We came back the next day for some more drinks (it is Vegas afterall!) and some food. The Hawaiian Mimosas were amazing! Not sure if they were worth $10, considering you don't get much. After we got our drinks we waited for a table for about 30 minutes. Once we sat down we were greeted by our waitress, who started off very attentive and then soon disappeared. until our check was delivered. I ordered the eggs benedict which were very mediocre. My friend ordered a corned beef egg dish that was also relatively bland. . . Overall, food was nothing special, drinks were pretty good, and atmosphere is great!
I had never been here before, and the few times that I have driven by I've always thought it was probably a strip joint as the windows are dark, and have those stereotypical, the purple and pink neon lights.  My wife, had mentioned this is one of her favorite places because of the rainbow sugar.  I figured might as well try out a new place...so i took her word for it and came in for a bite.. . Once inside, it looks even more like a strip joint than it did outside.  We walked in through the lounge area in the back...it's very dark, more Neon Purple and Pink lighting, that thick black carpeting and mirrored ceiling. Once through the lounge and into the restaurant, there was more lighting though the strip joint ambiance looks like it mated with a family friendly restaurant and gave birth to what is Peppermill.. . Our orders were taken, and our meals were served with in a few short minutes.  The food portions where pretty gnarly (at lest for what we got) and I definitely well worth it's price.. . I look forward to my next dining experience here.
Huge portions- super fun. Came here for dinner... but I suspect it is 1000x more awesome at 2 am after too many drinks. I will have to come back to find out.
The Peppermill is sort of like Denny's slutty older sister. That's the best way to describe it. You might think that's a good thing since, like any normal person, nothing gets you more hot and bothered than simultaneously thinking about skanks and Moons Over My Hammy. In reality, it's not so much a good thing (I know, hard to imagine how a slutty Denny's wouldn't be amazing). Unfortunately, the food is pretty terrible, and the service is about on-par with any other diner. If there is one saving grace, it's the nachos. And not because they're particularly delicious, but because of the sheer excess with which they're slammed onto your table. . . Atmosphere is about what you'd expect: lots of drunk people eating nachos. And lots of riff-raff treating it like an actual restaurant. It's not a restaurant, it's a hardcore nacho stop before you go throw up and go to sleep.
this review will be quick and to the point!!  open 24hrs. . . go hungry -- leave extremely full!!
Oh so wanted a benny for breakfast and after reading the reviews and seeing the photos I decided to walk a mile and half to this place for breakfast. It's really cool and the waitstaff is super friendly. I felt like I had been time warped to a Vegas way before I was born and have expected to see a hung over Elvis dining there. The food was good and with the prices so outrageous on the strip this was more affordable. My benny wasn't the best I have ever had but I enjoyed the moment in a funky environment. The service was fantastic-and I wondered how is the waitress so perky this morning- I had too many champagne cocktails at Absinthe and Fizz the night before. Viva Las Vegas!
I used to come here for lunch for work a while back and now I remember why I don't go there for any other reason. The food sucks, the prices are high, the service sucks, and it's COLD AS F$^# in there. This is a tourist trap sort of place, so be prepared for a very long wait for a table. My friends ordered soup and salads, and I ordered French Toast and coffee.  Everything was just MEH. I would never come here again.
Went here on Mothers Day which wasn't the best time to go, but waited in the cool bar area and chatted with the nice female bartender.  We split the corned beef hash which we asked for crispy and it was awesome!  Our waiter also let us order just one pancake which was huge and those two items were plenty for two women to split.  There was a guy going around taking photos at the tables and at first I thought, "Heck no!", but he was really nice and not pushy for us to purchase.  The decor is kind of funny, but I would highly suggest you go here for breakfast.  It's open 24 hours by the way.
Breakfast is really good here. I ordered the French toast breakfast, husband ordered corn beef and loved it. Overall good service, very attentive
Tonight I witnessed them kick out a gentlemen in a turban because of their "no hat" policy. I hope he sues them and shuts them down. Ignorant. #peppermilllounge
Let's start with the good...Atmosphere and servers make the place. Now to the bad. We went for breakfast, and it was average at best. I ordered bacon and eggs, poached. Two of the three eggs were way over done, so our server got a new order. By the time the they came out, the rest of the breakfast was finished, and the new order was over cooked as well.
Walking into The Peppermill is like walking into a lounge on a cruise ship. (Think mirrors, neon lights, palm trees, and flamingos.) If the tables were bolted to the floor, you'd swear you were on the S.S. Celebration. And that's a good thing, in my book.. . When we first moved to Vegas in the late '90s, we would bring every out-of-town guest here. I'm not sure when that tradition fell by the wayside, but it's time to reinstate it.. . Although we probably haven't been back in five years or more, nothing has changed since my first visit. Same gaudy decor. Same '70s music. Same great diner food. And, as far as I can tell, same prices. It may be a bit steeper than other places in town, but the prices are a steal for the Strip and the portions are so huge that you can pull two or even three meals out of one entree.. . That was certainly the case for my Cobb salad, which was just as big -- and delicious -- as I remember it. I ate a quarter of it for dinner and had leftovers for three more meals! My husband ordered The Conquest, which is a glorified roast beef sandwich, with a side of onion rings. I think they may have changed the recipe on the rings -- they seem to be more panko-y and less beer batter-y -- and the portion seemed bigger than in the past. But they were great, and as I said before, they may be the only thing that's changed since 1998.. . After dinner, we stopped in the lounge for a cocktail. Visiting the lounge is an event in itself. More mirrors, more neon, and a circular fire pit to entertain you and your date while you soak up the vibe. I usually get a mai tai, but I was so stuffed from dinner that I got something a little lighter: a Chambord lemon drop martini. It was a little sweet for my taste, but my husband's pineapple mojito was pretty tasty. And, once again, the prices were on par or lower than other bars on the Strip: less than $20 for both. . . Do yourself a favor and take a step back in time next time you're on the Strip. The Peppermill is open 24 hours, so this hot tub time machine is always ready for a party.
Havent been here in a while, so I decided to come back to actuallytry out the food this time. I used to come here to drink and meet up with friends. I was in the mood for a steak so I ordered the ribeye the food came out in a timely manner and the service was good . Sad to say the steak was not as good as the service . I'm a better stick myself and that is what I compared to. I felt like I ordered from a one star restaurant. I literally wanted to bring in my own cow and show them how to really make some good steak . I guess next time I'll stay in and cook my own.
Tropical cocktails in colored pictures and in massive glass globes, pink neons lights cast strange shadows on the faux foliage, gilded mirrors makes the room look like a ballroom while the cocktail servers, clad in floor-length ball gowns and soft sex voices, sashay around the bubbling fire pit. . . Strange place. But yes, I still take every one of my out-of-town friends here. Every single one.
