Cute French setting. the turkey, despite adding gravy was a bit dry.  The saffron rice ...well, went back for more :). Food sum up: a little bit if everything. . One thing I did not like was waiting in life for the bathroom;  For the multitude of people who come and dine here, there should be more bathroom stalls!!!
We ended up staying an extra night in Vegas because of Traffic on the Sunday after Thanksgiving was horrendous! We turned back on the 15 and I called Total Rewards and I did a comp room at Paris. Staying here , we decided to do the Buffet here. I have been before on previous trips and the food is always pretty good! . . I'm giving them 3 stars, because of service, not food. This most recent trip we came in at 8:45 p.m. and the line was short, but there were people waiting to be seated. From the time we purchased, until the time we were seated was 30 minutes! The place was not busy, so we ask what's going on, and they told us that they had some call outs. I totally understand. Our server took longer then normal, but she was working really hard and did an awesome job. Would come back, just hope the management could handle staff callouts better. It should not ever take 30 minutes to be seated in a nearly empty buffet.
Breakfast is average, service very friendly and down to earth. THE GOOD: quiches. And I don't even like quiche. strawberries. They are a different breed or something, very sweet, just lovely. Of the dishes we tried, i would go for seconds for the chocolate croissant, smoked salmon, bacon slabs,  and eggs Benedict.  THE HIT OR MISS: crepes. My husband was not impressed, but I loved two of the four I ordered (ok so we went bananas for the crepes). The crepe batter, sauces, and nuts/granola mixings were superb. How they are cooked though is chef dependent. We tried banana Nutella, 2 Berries, and apple cinnamon. The banana Nutella was decadent, and 1 of the berries were good. THE SO-SO: Dessert selection was non-existent at breakfast understandably. Bakery selection was limited to Danishes and croissants, too small for a French buffet in my opinion.
If I could give negative i would,  frozen salty crab legs, cold food, not a single good thing I can say about this buffet, waste of 30$ per person, within 30 min of eating I'm trying to keep it down but sadly loosing the fight
There crepe was very good... You can pick either a savory or sweet kind. I was surprised on how many different kinds of sausages they served. Not a big variety of other foods. Macaroons were very hard and all taste the same. Went here around 3 so I don't know if the dinner menu is different.
There is really good food here. Have no complaints about it but it could have been warmer. Food was a little cold for my taste but will be coming back. It was really good.
I purchased a lunch groupon for this buffet and my husband and I tried it out over the weekend. The groupon included a bottle of wine, and 2 lunch buffets for $35 and it was quite the deal. . . The buffet itself is okay, most of the stuff was yummy, and the spread was good. Some of the food was cold though (not supposed to be), so that turned me off a little bit. Prime rib was okay, more fat than meat, but nice flavor. The made to order crepe station was awesome. Lots of seafood, even though it was a lunch buffet. HUGE dessert selection.. . Our service was fantastic, our waitress was always around to get us drink refills which was a big deal, as we were kind of dehydrated from the night before ! I would return here again, the food was way better than some of the other buffets we've been to in Vegas.
This used to be our FAVORITE brunch buffet in Vegas and unfortunately over the last couple of years it has gone down hill :(  . . They used to have a huge lox and bagels and smoked fish selection and now it's very small and just shoved in a corner.   . . The over all quality is lacking, it's a shame.
I went for breakfast on a Monday morning so I can really only speak for that. For the price (I think about $20) it was perfect. Would I go for the higher weekend prices for breakfast? probably not. The food was delicious, there was a large selection but really I think I expected more. I feel like what I got was pretty standard breakfast options (pastries, eggs made lots of ways, pancakes, french toast, bagels, yogurts, fruit, typical breakfast meats). Don't get me wrong, that's what I wanted and what I and my party ate and it was good. I guess I just figured for all the hype, there would be more "oooh i've never seen/had that!" and "oooh i've never had that for breakfast!" options. Nonetheless, would go again for the same price (i guess weekedays in the morning) but not for weekend inflation.
All you can eat Great Food for a good price. Added to the experience of being in Vegas.
According to some list I read, this buffet regularly ranks in the top five in Vegas. Unfortunately, there's a really big gap between #1 (Bacchanal) and anywhere else. Like most buffets, this place has some solid dishes and a lot of fillers. Their gimmick, being in the Paris casino, is having French dishes. Unfortunately, buffet-quality French simply isn't that great.. . HITS: chicken de Provence, truffle and veggie cavatappi pasta, prime rib was solid, eggs were cheesy as hell if you're into that sort of thing, crepe station, Sunday brunch includes champagne that is surprisingly good despite low retail price, limited dessert selection for  a place that's hyping up their French affiliation.. . MISSES:  French onion soup is super salty dregs, pate at charcuterie area is not good, their entire sushi selection consists of literally a single crab maki roll, entirely too many breakfast options still out at 2PM, heated plates at dessert station lead to melted desserts. . . SERVICE: They're busy, I get that. Hostess is inefficient, three groups of 6+ held up the line for half an hour until someone came up and figured out that pairs could be seated immediately and the line started moving again. Our server either had far too many tables or short term memory loss, served half our drink order then forgot the alcohol until we reminded her half an hour later (the next time we saw her).. . Not the best buffet but certainly not the worst. Pricing is decent, but only if you like filling up on grilled meats and think a selection of  fancy breads makes you "French".
We had purchased a buffet pass and ended up having both breakfast and dinner here. It had a decent selection and decent food. If you get the pass, this one is worth visiting but plan ahead! The best time to come is a little before a typical meal hour so that you don't have to wait on a ridiculous line.
Breakfast at least village is great way to start your day. The ambience inside make you feel like you are in the street cafe at Paris. Omelette station was out standing. Thank god my platinum TR card get me into VIP lane, the line is too long.
Went there for Christmas eve holiday dinner with my family of four - spouse and two kids under 12 (6 and 11). Over priced ($150!! Kids pay adult price), over crowded and not that great of selection. Cashier couldn't justify the extra charge ($7/pp) for so called "holiday dinner". Service was generally slow and cooks couldn't replenish fast enough. 30 minute wait at 3pm in afternoon. Overall experience was mediocre and a huge rip-off.
Out of all of the buffets in Vegas, Paris I believe has the best one!. . Tri-tip, roast beef, prime rib, the list goes on! The signature of this buffet? FRESH crepes made right in front of you! There are sweet and savory crepes. For a dinner price of $39.99, it's definitely worth it.. . My party and I got here around 3PM and thankfully we beat the crowd. The line starts to get very long around 4PM.
Had not been here for a while! decided to give it another  try.  What a waste of time! Gone way, way down hill. The  only thing french about this place is its location in the Paris Hotel.  The food was tasteless and lacked authenticity.  About the only thing worthwhile was the crepe station.  Save your money.  Eat elsewhere, better, for a lot less.
We waited in line for 2 hours to eat at this buffett and we're very disappointed. When you wait in line for 2 hours you expect the food to be worth the wait but that was not the case. The crab legs were sitting on ice and some of them still frozen. I don't know about everyone else but I prefer hot or at least warm crab legs. The sushi was terrible. The fish inside the rolls was good but the rice was tough and chewy. Both the clams and the mussels had a lot of sand and pieces of shell... very crunchy.  The rest of the food they had to offer was good but by no means great and definitely not worth the wait to get in. The crepes would have been realy good if the fruit they put inside them wasn't still frozen : ( We also had to ask for refills on our waters and then wait about 5 minutes for them. Not worth half the money or the wait.
Yes, the crepes are awesome.  But I think what's also nice about this buffet is the size and ambiance.  It's quaint, smaller than the other buffets on the list (Buffet of buffets) but the wait staff are friendly and while being smaller may not necessarily be a good thing during rush hour, wife and I came for brunch and were satisfied with the overall quality, an important distinction considering all of the dining choices people have on the strip.
Awesome, such an upgrade from the flamingo which I tried earlier. The crepes were just phenomenal. Had the banana, hazelnut and Nutella crepe first then the berry crepe with strawberries, blueberries, raspberries  and whipped cream. These were both fantastic. They had all sorts of fresh stations for carvings and breakfast meats. This is the place for breakfast but get there early, by 10:30 the line was 40 people deep to get in and not moving
Food are fine. Not too many choices of food and presentation are not that pretty. There are seafood like oyster, crab legs, shrimp cocktail, musli at dinner but oyster and musli are not so fresh. Overall is okay with the price. For my opinion, I prefer to pay 10$ more to eat at wicked spoon or 20$more to have the best one at Caesars Palace.
