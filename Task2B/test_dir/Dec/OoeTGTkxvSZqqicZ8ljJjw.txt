When you accidentally walk outside and want to re-enter into the club please be prepared for a 45 minute wait. Ohh and you are in heels nicely dressed please expect to feel like you look like a piece of dirt. I've watched account less people with jeans and tee shirts walk in before us. The service is terrible, not what I'm use to as a local. Vey upset.
OVERRATED! We waited 4 HOURS to see HARDWELL, who isn't even as big as Calvin Harris or Tiesto, and guess WTF happened? We WAITED. We stood for 4 hours in front of the DJ booth and guess what happens? The bouncer brings over trust fund babies and puts them right in front of us. Even better though.. The trust fund babies, who happen to be all guys, PAYS the bouncer TWICE and says "get us some girls." Kid you not, here come another group of 6 people!! Is this happening? Did we just pay $200 to get in and you put some drunk, spoiled brats in front of us who keep pushing us back and turning to give us dirty looks. Efffff you Hakkasan! Absolute trash!! Never again!!
Don't let the great DJ's they have make you overlook this review!. . I don't understand designers thinking sometimes. Hakkasan in the MGM has so much going for it. They are the hot new club on the strip, they have incredible resident DJ's, and people want to go there. But what they have done is ignored normal party goers and catered to the wealthy that will spend big bucks on a table. . . I'm not joking if you don't have big $$$ don't waste your time. The entire 4th floor is basically tables for VIP. For us normal folk they funnel you to the dance floor through ONE staircase that is used to enter and exit the dance floor. Good luck getting on or off once it fills up. Took me 5 minutes pushing and shoving (politely I might add) to move 20 feet. The dance floor itself feels like it is a 6 by 6 box that they try to jam 500 people on to, there is just no space for anyone. Dancing is non existent as you just try to stay upright in the hoards of people. Then, once you think you have room enough to maybe move a bit to the beat someone pushes past, and the shoving match ensues again. Also we heard that theft is an issue here, because people are jammed in so tight it would be tough to notice someone grabbing your wallet or phone. Someone next to us had their phone stolen. Needless to say before my wife and I got the chance to see Hardwell we left. . . I feel like this club really missed the mark. You can only survive on being the hit Club so long. But this club is built for a minority of people willing to spend thousands on tables not those of us willing to shell out hundreds just to stand, there is no where to sit and rest your feet BTW. And don't think you can stand anywhere outside the main floor and see the DJ as there are no such places. Non that they let you stand in anyway, they have people that will tell you to move if you try. Won't be long before they have people out on the street begging you to come in here. . . Oh and they wanted to charge me $23 for a Red Bull and vodka. I laughed and walked away as I value my money a bit more than that.  . . It's a shame because it really is a beautiful club, really nicely built and awesome lights but there is just no room. Big missed opportunity.. . This is a review on the main dance floor on the 4th level (Hardwell, Tiesto, Calvin Harris) so don't let this review dissuade you from going and trying something else there.  . . UPDATE: Hakkasan to their credit contacted me and asked me to come back and try the club again. I declined as I don't feel a return trip will bring a different experience for me unless the layout has changed. Plus we live in Utah. I'd like to say we found the staff we interacted with to be mostly friendly other than the bouncers.
Promoters call it the best place go party in America. Boy are they wrong. Contacted a promoter to see Calvin Harris on Dec 28th. Mind you I am a girl and have 4 other girl friends with me. It seemed like we were all set on the guestlist and everything but when we got there they wanted a $40 cover. Um no. Girls in Vegas should never have to pay cover. A different and much better promoter ended up getting us free bottle service at surrender that same night and we had a blast. Then we decided to give it another shot and went to see tiesto a few days later. Holy shit it was packed like sardines. There is literally no room to move. It was awful. Skip this place and hit up marquee. So much better.
As most fellow reviewers pointed out, if you do not have bottled service, prepare to stand the entire time.. . Apart from that, there was a lot of room to dance, and the music was good too.. . Coat check is ridiculously mismanaged.
Loads of club promoters throughout the casinos adding everyone to the guest list. My sister and nanny were added to the list and showed up around 12:45am. There was no big line to enter (great) but the we spent 15 minutes waiting while 4 bouncers could not agree over the validity of my sister's maryland license and my nanny's passport. Both are over 21 and had valid id. There was no need for the bouncers to give them a hard time or sarcastically and in a threatening manner ask if they should go get a police officer to confirm authenticity. What happened to having a system where you can scan to confirm validity? It was not until we said forget it we will go somewhere else that the bouncers said Ok you can come in. We left. I understand taking your job seriously and I get that these guys probably deal with fake ids, but more than 15 minutes and poor attitudes?  Sad to see so much effort to recruit business only to lose it before it brings revenue...
I have been to this club a couple of times. I always had fun each time I've been there. The table service was great, sanitary and professional. There's always been a large crowd whenever I've been there. The DJs have always been awesome as well!
After a great dinner, had tickets to go the club, either this place is always packed or I came on the night where DJ Afrojack was playing and  is probably one of the popular DJ's playing in Vegas right now. Needless to say... expect to stand like sardines and smell like one afterwards. I admit it, I can't see at night, probably the worse is at night walking into a dark, foggy, confetti club can be a bit tricky and scary. Guys, when a girl looks at you for a split second, it doesn't mean they want you, also with the music blaring so loud, don't expect to get a name, where are you from and which hotel your staying?Just stick with smiling and dancing without any strings attached. Love the house music. It's just waayyy too crowded to be on the floor, I ended up along the stairs dancing to the wall. Cause if I dare to stare at anyone, they attach to you like glue the whole entire night. So many choices of nightclubs, this one is rated #2, since we were having dinner here and we only were staying one night, it was fun to get my groove on.
I have come here twice and basically it seems like your typical generic Vegas nightclub with a few additional minuses. They won't give you tap water and charge $9 for bottled water. Very claustrophobic dance floor. The main issue for why I won't come back is they have a major theft issue which security doesn't seem to take seriously. 3 out of 4 of my group had our phones pick pocketed and many others in our vicinity as well. Security guards rolled their eyes when we told them. There are many better options to choose in Vegas so I have no plans to come back.
Located inside the MGM Resort, this club is definitely one of the hottest places to be on the Las Vegas Strip. When Marquee wouldn't let us in because my boy is all tatted up to his face, we came here with the hopes that they wouldn't hate on us. Not only did Hakkasan grant us admission, but they were very reasonable with the "guy" price of cover. This club is definitely one of my favorites in terms of layout. The dance floor is huge, has plenty bar space, and has great EDM talent for their resident DJs. That night we were glad to have seen Nervo rock the house! Overall, if you are looking for that Vegas nightclub experience then definitely make your way to Hakkasan.
I've been to Xs, Tryst, Surrender, Marquee and the club inside the Eiffel Tower at Paris and this is the most low quality club I've ever been to in Las Vegas.  To try and make up for the lack luster appearance they spend all their money on DJ's and none of the Decor. . Garbage 100%. . Want an unforgettable night?. Go to XS!. . Want a club with horrible lighting, small, cramped, and mediocre in every aspect?. Then this is the place for you!. . This is the circus circus of Las Vegas clubs.
I went here on a Thursday night, being lured in on the illusion that all the floors would be open and hoping they had different music playing on all floors, I WAS WRONG. Worst DJ ever the music really sucked, and it was full of old people. We decided to try it again Friday since some of my friends weren't able to hang out with us on Thursday night, we waited about an Hour in line for nothing. Security decided that my boyfriend did not look like the picture on his ID. Well of course not morons. His ID picture was taken years ago when he was younger. They actually thought they knew what they were doing, they had like 6 people look at it, only to help me come to the conclusion that their security Management sucks. I really wish I remembered the "bosses" name who was a total arrogant prick. This club sucks. I'm glad we didn't get in they were not worth any of our money after the inconvenience they gave us. I honestly believe this is one of the worst clubs on the strip. They should really make the requirements to get a job here more strict. They have no idea what the heck they are doing. What a disappointment.
Do not go to this club, regardless of who is DJing. There is a crime ring that steals cellphones, IDs, credit cards, etc. straight out of your purse.. . Security is an absolute joke - after reading the reviews of others who've had their personal effects stolen and notified security, I'm starting to think that the security has ties with the people stealing things. They might be getting a cut of the profits so they don't care to do anything about the fact there are people stealing other peoples' things in their club.. . The dance floor is PACKED and it's a huge fire hazard. The DJs don't come on until 2am or later, and the crowd is filled with disgusting douchebags and drunk people who will fall or vomit on top of you because they can't even stand up straight. Having people fall on, step on, and elbow you in a crowd that's already packed tighter than a can of sardines is NOT fun. There's nowhere to sit, I could barely breathe it was so packed.. . They don't provide tap water, so you will need to purchase $9 mini bottles of Fuji water. Drinks are even more expensive and watered down.. . After my experience here, I will never set foot back into this disgusting place ever again. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs.
The reviews are all RIGHT! I should've listened. Can't say I wasn't warned.... . We were told 60$ and was charged 110$. We were very first in line Saturday night, got into the club right @10 when it opened. We got to walk around and see how the entire place looked like. Wow! This is such a  gorgeous place, smells good, and very clean but once it hits 10-30-11 all the way on... it is body to body, & disgustingly, annoyingly packed. Apparently this isn't hazardous?.. they form a line to the dance floor too. I feel like you have to 'claim' a spot, camp out and make sure you have your drinks ready in hand. This place seriously doesn't limit how many people comes in probably because during nights with a headliner they need/want to make their money. I wanted to give Hakkasan a chance so bad because this was the place I wanted to go to the most out of all the clubs there for my first time being in Vegas. Largest club in the world, not enough capacity to hold the people. May be they really need to take out the tables because seriously all the space that is taken up is not only by the people being squished in on a small dance floor but the tables also take up a lot of room. If you want to buy one, regardless of how expensive it already costs (close to 8grand and over), it is still sold out! I can't believe I was actually almost considering this.. . Bought  an almost even ratio 9 girls 8 guys, NO free drinks. I had a lesser ratio of girls at the other clubs I went to and was definitely better taken care of. . . Here, they only cater to higher class people. Because they got the name and the fames. They wouldn't care about you unless your name is Rihanna. . .  900 dollars down the drain, spent 1 and a half hour to be treated like shit by the security guards &  employees. So, so disappointed. Walked all the way back to the hotel. . . They need to be more professional here especially if they are banking of hundreds of people. I'm never ever coming back again, I don't care who is the headline or what famous people attend. I will de-edify this to anyone I know. It is not worth it. Total Buzzkill.  Go on a weekday, it's probably a lot better. However, I'd rather you go somewhere where they care about your money.. . (This review is for back in July)
The only way to enjoy that club is with a table, the closest to the dance floor the better. We had a table next to the DJ which was good but for next time I will pick one next to the dance floor. The place is impressive, great sound, and private restrooms with gourds all around. The crew took good care of us threw out the evening. . Dance floor was packed. In a club that big they could allow a bigger floor to dance. . It seems that all they really care about is to take care of those who have tables.. I had an amazing time thete.. Will be back
Worst club experience ever. I'm a Las Vegas local and have experienced many clubs here and abroad. Hakkasan tops my worst experience EVER (topping my Tao Nightclub birthday experience where it was so packed that people were spilling drinks and getting their clothes stuck on each other because they couldn't move 5inches). This was my third attempt at trying to get in. The first time, the line was outside the casino and the second time we made it all the way to the entrance only to be told it was $10 off the main price for those on the guestlist. . . My friends and I arrived early since we were on the guestlist for a promoter. We waited 3 hours to get to the coat checkline, where we were notified it was MANDATORY ($5) to check in your coat. There was a huge discrepancy in regards to who thought a coat with buttons versus zippers qualified a coat check in or not (this applied to girls). We then had to get into another line to get in. When we finally make it in, the place was so packed you couldn't dance or mingle, much less stand any where remotely appropriate that didn't block traffic or get you moved because VIP tables where near by. . . If you want a fun club experience go to Marquee, XS, Tryst (even though it's small). It's too bad they have some awesome headliners for EDM. But they obviously didn't plan out the layout or considered those who aren't purchasing $500+ tables. Spend your money else where.
This club is full of shit . They promote guys are free with an even ratio of guys and girls but you get to the front and they will still charge guys the full price of over 100. Deceiving and just want all the hoopla outside and will never let you in for "free"
