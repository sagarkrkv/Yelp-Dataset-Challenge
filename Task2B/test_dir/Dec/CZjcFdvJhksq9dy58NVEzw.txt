Quick tips incoming!. . 1. This buffet is located in the center of the gaming floor in the Bellagio casino.. . 2. The line appears to move much more quickly than that of other buffets. So don't fret about a long line! Realistically it's a pretty short wait when compared to Bacchanal.. . 3. On the little island area next to the bar, there are several made to order dishes. You must ask a person to make you what is behind the counter! Don't hesitate to ask.. . One thing about this buffet, that seems to have happened to my girlfriend and me was the fact that every time we went it felt like we were getting diminishing returns on our enjoyment of this place.. . First off, I must say that if Yelp were to allow us to rate their level of service and the food, I would almost give it five stars. There have been some problems when we pay for our buffet from pretty shoddy and downright awful service. What I mean by this is, on a few occasions, the people who were taking our money were absolutely impolite. One time, we tried to charge our room at a different MGM resort. However, the lady taking the money was not having it since the system was not really working properly. She angrily told us to pay with a credit card or with cash or get out. . . Anyways, besides service problems at intake, the servers and bussers in the buffet area are always top notch. I have never had to complain about a server. They are incredibly efficient and thoughtful with your needs.. . The second thing, that results in such a low rating then is that the food just isn't as good as it is every time we go. Like I said about diminishing returns, it seems that every time we go to the buffet the food gets worse and worse and more and more unappetizing. For example, we LOVED their prime rib. We couldn't stop raving about how awesome it was all the way home and to our friends. However, after our last few trips, we were so disappointed by the quality and dryness of the meat.. . As for the desserts, it feels like the Bellagio is caught in some sort of timewarp. They are still trapped in the early 2000s where soft-serve ice cream is the norm for most buffets. I don't know why they haven't updated to gelato or at least scoopable ice cream.. . Anyways, the Bellagio Buffet is still an iconic part of the Vegas strip! You should still try it out to see if you like it. Happy eating! :)
It's not the best buffet in Vegas anymore, that's for sure. I almost want to give it 2 stars, but I think it's still better than most buffets. . . I came here a couple of days before Christmas because my friend had a front of the line pass. I was so glad he had that because the line looked pretty long. It was nice to just be able to walk in. It cost $48 because of holiday prices, but it didn't seem that worth it. . . They had Alaskan King Crab legs and the standard snow crab legs and prime rib. They even had a Kobe round, which looked better than it tasted. The meat was tough and not good at all. I should have figured when the lady took forever slicing everybody else's meat and didn't even bother with mine, so I ended up with a thick 1 1/2 inch piece. Both types of crab legs were not very tasty. The dessert offerings did not include crepe and gelato, which I thought was standard fare for the higher end buffets. Everything I tasted was just bleh and not worth the price.. . I've been to Bellagio quite a few times before and used to regard it as one of the better buffets in Vegas. After this last time though, I was really disappointed and probably won't be returning anytime soon.
This is pretty much an average buffet.  Nothing in the buffet had me going back for seconds.  . . Our party of three went over the thanks giving weekend and it was more expensive at $50pp.  We expected a little something more at that price.  All that was offered additionally was turkey and ham roast carvery which we didn't even try as it looked rather dismal.  . . Two stars given due to the increased price. .  . In summary:. Stay away from the Asian food and caviar bar. Seafood selection is average at best. Prime rib is nice. Dessert selection is nice. . DO NOT bother paying extra for the "holiday special".
Wish I could give it less than a star.....the worst!!!. We were sick the entire day!. Even a local came up to us and said he thought that it had gone down in quality....DONT EAT HERE!!!
Maybe not one of the top 3 but definitely one of the most popular Vegas buffets.  Bellagio buffet is large, straightforward, not exactly opulent, but certainly nice and consistent enough to make one feel pretty good about paying the high-ish but rather reasonable price.  . . I've eaten here twice in two different trips to Vegas, each time pretty satisfied.  The selections are impressive and mostly good quality, though not any particular item stands out as amazing.  The Asian foods are not so great.  Rather than going for a fun or super posh interior, Bellagio chose sort of a nondescript upscale food court look that gets the job done but is in no way memorable.  . . So in sum a solid, if not outstanding buffet.
My roommate's parents were in town and she is so sweet, she treated us all to a late lunch.  I wish it were possible to physically be able to eat more when you go to a buffet because they are so expensive !  I never feel like I am getting my monies worth. But I guess you just have to take bite sizes of everything...that must be the trick!  We mainly went, because she and her parents are huge fans of crab legs and they offter them during the week.  I'm a huge fan of meat and carbs and sweets.  We all left happy.
So I don't know what happened but for the absolute longest I had strong opinions about not liking this buffet.  Maybe I came at the wrong time but I very vividly remember thinking the food was not all that and it was over hyped and not cracked up to how great everyone said it was.  I just remember all of the flavors being a little muted and bland and everything tasting blah and I swear I almost chipped my tooth on the toast.  So years  (or a decade, whatever) went by and I was urged to try it out once more.  Sure why not.  I was very surprised I feel like they must have revamped it.  The quality of the food was much better than I remembered. So anyway I wanted to give a shout out to one of the employees Silvia holding it down in the fruit and cheese department.  On  one of my trips I noticed they didn't gave granola.  I asked a few employees if they had it.  Almost all of them but one (Silvia) sort of shrugged it off saying it wasn't offered that day.  Silvia however, went in the back brought it out, and tracked me down in a sea of people to show me where she placed it! Who does that?!  Plus it was a pleasant surprise the food was definitely of a higher caliber than I previously remembered.
Today is Sunday, good price, no waiting, food and service are great!. . Love sea bass, king crab, prime rib....
Needed a Buffet that had Sea food, this place hit the spot. Snow crab and king crab, Prime rib, ok salad bar, a lot of different meats and cooked veggies. The desert bar was very beautiful and tasty. So $34.00 but well worth it. Staff was friendly and prompt with refills.
The best buffet in Las Vegas, and the rest of the buffets in the state, excellent selection of high quality foods, I recommend it to you any time you're in Vegas.
Came there at 1st of Dec. . No need to explain more, just GOOD...!!. you will not disappoint
I went here in August and it was the best buffet I had ever been at.  After eating at the Rio it was 100% improvement.  I had the best chicken I had ever had and an entire plate of amazing desserts.. . I came back in December and it wasn't as good as I remember.  Still great, but I didn't adore it as well.  The desserts were, meh.  The breakfast was good and th bacon was perfect.. . Still one of the best buffets on the strip.
First time here, food was good, more then enough. I'm so stuff with all the options they have.. . I only came to the buffet for a birthday party, but it was well worth it. I'm so full and the food was great. Next time I'm here in Vegas this will be the buffet for me.. . Line wasn't long, food was hot, service was perfect, nice clean restaurant,  thank you.
Excelente opcion , algo caro pues casi pagas 40 dolares por persona ,pero muy buena seleccion de comida y los postres deliciosos , las galletas de cacahuate de otro planeta.  Muy recomendable.
Food: There's a wide selection, not as much as I would have hoped. There's fruits, desserts, sushi, seafood, Chinese, Meats, desserts, and a grand selection of starches. I wish they had more vegetarian specific dishes, not just fruits, veggies, and salad.  There's also a bar. . . Price: It's somewhat reasonable, however considering it was a bit pricey, I would have enjoyed a wider range of selection, since it's somewhat high end.. . Location: It's located inside Bellagio. I'm not sure how it is if you drive, since we walked. . . Wait Time: Somewhat long, but it is a buffet in a hotel, so it's understandable. It wasn't that long of a wait to sit 6 adults and 1 toddler. There was a line to wait, but the wait wasn't unbearable. When we were finally seated, I saw there were a lot of open tables, which didn't make sense to me. There were also a lot of servers, so I don't think there was a problem of not having a server for different areas around the buffet seating area. . . Service: It was ok. I mean the guy serving our drinks and taking our plates was great, friendly, and funny. But the lady hostess weren't the most friendly people. Since we had a toddler, we needed a high chair. When the hostess saw my mom carrying my nephew, the hostess asked to take away the high chair. Of course, my mom just said yes to be polite, but I thought it was really rude to that. I mean, there were other tables that requested a high chair and ended up holding their baby half-way through. It's just rude to that, because later we needed to use it.. . Ambience: There are a lot of people and it does get crowded, which is expected in a buffet setting. Crowding also means it is noisy. Although, at least we didn't hear the plates clashing "behind doors," which some buffets are known for.
Best breakfast buffet in USA I say. I hate buffets but love the Bellagios for breakfast. The coffee is better than starbucks. Understand there may be a line but its well worth it. Came here for my wifes 30th birthday breakfast and look..shes picky and high falootin and still loves it. Maybe she wont admit it...but....
Terrible food. The day before we had buffet at the Caesar's and had amazing time with 5 star service.. . Bellagio buffet is poorly designed and implemented. The food choice is limited with no hot food.. Well let me reiterate the "hot" food is only mildly warm, so do not let the steam trick you. The king crab legs are cold not like the Caesar's where the chef boils the crab and give them to you right on the spot..  . The food tastes like cheap low class that you can find at local suburban casino. Close to frozen sushi (only 2-3 choices), smoked salmon?!! Which is not fresh yikes. The only thing We liked is the lamb.. . Service is more like bus boys not much attention to patrons...
They offer large selection of all kind of food.. Food is good but it remains a buffet, it's not a 5 star restaurant.. . You can choice from pizza, pasta, sushi, seafood, meat, fish, vegetables, [retty much everything.... The selection of cheese is not that great.. For desert, they offer pastries, fruits, cakes.. . You end up being very full after this buffet.. . Brunch is served until 3pm on weekends at 29.99 and dinner from 3pm is 34.99.
So i read theholiday menu before i decided to take my family to dinner at a premium price .  I paid 211 for a party of four.  Several of the holiday items on the listed menu were not being offererd.  No lobster tail,caviar,lamb chops, scallops,or salted caramel mousse.   The buffet is small quality was great for what they did have but i give it a three star for the premium price yet not offering what they listed which would have made price worth it.  First and last time here I recommend the M resort great food great price and huge selection e wine and beer include
Went there with my family on 12/23. That was okay, Buffet... Prime rib and Kobe Steak was good. Paying $50/person during the Christmas time, I was expecting more than that for some reason...
It's comparatively much better than most other buffets I've tried in neighbor hotels. A little expensive but worth every penny if you have a good appetite:)
This buffet is alright. It has the essentials which are prime rib and crab legs. What it doesn't have is a modern/clean look and beautiful scenery. I guess I started off by saying these things because I went to Bacchanal Buffet the day before at Caesar's Palace and that blew away every single buffet experience I've ever had.. . The buffet at the Bellagio is obviously better than a random buffet off the strip. You pay for what you get for here (~$40 for a tasty buffet that's not bad). Paying $12 for all your can eat garbage somewhere else isn't comparable. But when you compare it to the Bacchanal Buffet, you'll understand what I'm trying to say in this review. I'm still going to give this place 4 stars (well deserved), but this is really a comparison review to the best buffet in Las Vegas (as already stated).. . So, if you're going to only one buffet in Las Vegas, I do not recommend coming here. If for some reason you end up here though, you're stomach will still be happy and money well-spent.. . Be sure to crab some crab legs and walk to the pasta station to get them steamed. Oh, and be sure to walk to another location to get butter. This is unlike the amazing/beautiful/spacious Bacchanal Buffet where you get your crab legs steamed and grab butter in the same location (makes sense right?).
A colossal disappointment!!!  Don't waste your money. Waited in line for over an hour (some for 3 hours), and spent $106 for two people. Lots of pasta and "fillers" and only a couple of high end stuff. Most of the food was mediocre and some of it was down-right bad!!  Very, very small suchi collection, most of which didn't even have any seafood in it. Prime rib was bad and the other protein was bland. All of the soups tasted like Campbell's or Progresso can soup with even less flavor. Stay away.
$25/person for weekday lunch! . . Honestly got to say its better than the Bacchanal in Caesar's Palace. It was cheaper, the staff was nicer, and the food had better quality.. Family came in once it opened, paid upfront first, and we immediately got seats close to the food. Roughly 30 mins later, 12:30pm, the place was getting packed and there was a huge line outside. Definitely come here early! They have everything you can think of: sushi, pizza, prime rib, crab legs, salads, soups, sirloin, omelet station, I'm not even covering the best and most! It was super delicious! The waitresses were attentive and refilled the drinks even before it was half empty. If the entrees weren't enough, the dessert station was going to finish you off! Sorbets, chocolate cakes, key lime pie, pumpkin pie, ice cream, cookies, cheesecake, etc!. . Just try this place out for lunch, it's cheaper than the other guys and much better too!
This is my 2nd time eating at this buffet.  It's definitely a splurge for us as they never have 2:1 coupons which we like to use at other casino buffet's.  We were able to apply from mLife credit which helped a little.. . With that, this last time we were there on 12/28 for brunch, we had the best server!  She gave us tips on how to get the crab legs steamed (take them to the pizza counter and ask them) so they are nice and hot.  When I couldn't decide on a drink, she offered to just bring both!  . . The food here is always top notch.  One thing I missed this time was gelato!  They replaced it with soft serve.  They get points for having raspberry and peach sorbet as well as well chocolate and vanilla.  But honestly, since you can get soft serve at any other buffet, that dings it one star.  Picky I know, but heck, I'm picky.  Service however gets 5 stars this time around.  . . Can I also add another reason we went to this buffet was I just won $250 on a Wheel of Fortune slot.  Helped pay for the meal.
Not the greatest experience..  Here's why, poor and inefficient managment..  Too expensive (not enough selection of food for the money you paid). My napkin had food and lipstick on it for the last person who used it..  Which made me sick. But one good thing was the food,  the food was well made and full of taste..  Alot of other better buffets on the strip. NOT WORTH THE WAIT IN LINE FOR 1 HOUR AND 45 MIN.
Waited in line for 30 mins on a Sunday around 2:00PM. . All you can eat crab legs and champagne and prime rib and salmon is worth the $50!. . Sushi and dessert wasn't that good. Breakfast items were okay.. . I enjoyed the pesto mashed potatoes, never had that before!. . But eating and drinking here definitely put me in a food comma after!
This place is not good at all. They only have two registers and let customers wait for hours, for the purpose of selling passes for 20 dollars to let people jump the queue. Moreover, during Christmas season, they have some special event for brunch which costs approximately $40 per person( instead of the regular lunch price), but I think the food is worse than the $8 buffet in Ann Arbor. They do have crab and salmon, but you have to wait again to get the crab, and it is not delicious (it is smoked salmon instead of raw salmon). Other than that, the food variety is very limited. Instead, I would highly recommend Umiya for buffet (Japanese food). It costs only $25 for much better food!
Bellagio... always a good choice... what can I say.... pictures worth a thousand words.... . the only thing is that they need to have more choices for ice creams than the old machine they have there for so many years....
