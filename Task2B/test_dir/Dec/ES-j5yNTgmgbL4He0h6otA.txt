If you haven't been to Munich, this is a good simulation.  The beer is very good as is the authentic presentation.  The food is also quite authentic, which may not suit everyone, since most folks haven't had German food in Germany.  Seating is very traditional, so get to know your neighbors! Service is very attentive, but not obtrusive.  What I'm not so happy about is the volume level (hard surfaces + amplified performers + crowd = noisy.) While I appreciate the authentic music, the routines can be disruptive.  It's a long walk from the Strip, but definitely worth a cab ride if you like beer!
We've been to Hofbrauhaus on previous visits to Vegas and always had a good experience.  After this trip, I have no desire to go back.  We were there for an early dinner, so the service was bit rushed since they weren't busy yet.  We ordered a pretzel for an appetizer.  I recall them being served warm.  This one was cold, so it was just OK.  After being asked several times, we ordered the Veal brats for dinner - it arrived within minutes, so it was all pre-cooked apparently.  This made me very glad we hadn't placed the order earlier.  The meal actually was delicious.  That was the best part of the evening.  What really put a damper on the evening, though, was ordering a shot at the end.  Don't order a shot unless you want a big welt on your butt!  We didn't realize this was the consequence.  On previous trips, members of our party had ordered a shot and did not get whacked.  This time, the staff was very eager and insistent about it.  I was very uncomfortable and was going to leave it (my boyfriend ordered the shot for me), but he finally drank it.  A server other than ours was instantly over and eager to deliver the punishment.  She was actually kind of mean about it and my boyfriend still has a welt on his behind 5 days later.  I guess they get a twisted satisfaction out of being mean to the people to leave them tips for slightly overpriced beer and food.  I was mad because he was really looking forward to going and ended up being in pain for the rest of the evening and the next day.  Hofbrauhaus definitely won't be on my list of places to go on my next trip to Vegas!
Have never experienced German food.. the pork sausage.. was amazing.  The beer "Dunkel" was smooth... no bitterness.  Great experience
Love this pace! Fun, authentic, great atmosphere! I've been to Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany and it was such a great experience, I was pleasantly surprised to find the Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas managed to capture the same fun atmosphere and great tasting beer and food. Would definitely recommend.
This is our second time in, each time with friends who came into town. Ask for Amanda!!! Tip her well. The service is great, the food is better. You, your family and friends will have a great time here. Ask for Amanda and you will have an especially good time. Drink beer, eat food and laugh!
Tikka Takke Tikka Takke Oi Oi Oi!. . It's a Bavarian German mess hall with bench seating and bosomed bar maids and boots of booze!. . My favorite imported brews are served in giant glass steins with strong heft to them.  Dunkel brau ist mein favorite.  Strangely enough I find a connection with my 3rd generation removed Germanic bloodline to be very intoxicating at Hofbrau.  Decorated in faux old fatherland fixings.  The atmosphere is most inviting and exiting as you are transported to the old castle days reminiscent of lederhosen and clogs.  Think St. Pauli girl in practice.  Various Germanic accents abound they really have a knack for the "Vegas recreation" feel here.. . The traditional brats wieners and Vienna sausages on order are accompanied quite stoutly with the beers on tap and the pretzels and bitter sides with sauerkraut are an attestment to the dedication to the stout beer this culture has dedicated itself to throughout history.  In other words everything on the menu tastes much better with a glug of beer.  Seriously not knocking the taste of the food in general, but much like most European countries the cuisine is somewhat mated to the alcoholic beverage of favor.  You seriously can't fully appreciate the food with out the drink.  Sour goes great with stout. . . The entertainment is live and seemingly imported as well.  Lively stereotypical lederhosen wearing front man singing and commanding communal cheers throughout the meal.  It is a good idea to keep the large steins filled.  Raise a glass.  Shout an old world cheer.  Take a big drink and slam the glass on the table.  What medieval fun.  Sure to find yourself tipsy you may be ordered a Jeager paddle with assorted shots from which you will be challenged to gullet down in concession and afterwards the bar maids will give you one Hell of a brutal paddling for being a bad boy!  Old drinking game contests may be held from the band and you can possibly get a glass stein for winning.. . Major fun can be had at the Hofbruahaus!  Make sure to stagger into the gift shop afterwards and check out the great trinkets mugs and grab a six pack of the great beer for your hangover in the morning.. . Prost!
Yes, there are some nods to American tourist expectations here BUT.... . I had the pleasure of hosting some folks from Bavaria (Regensburg and down in Austria) for a convention in LV and gave them some choices for Christmas dinner.  They chose this place and I have to say I was worried, knowing Americans' propensity to "Disney-fy" everything.. . They guys loved it saying it was like being home.  Perhaps the HB in Munich is different (and I suspect more than a little driven at tourists as well) but a group of 10 folks who would know found this place perfectly acceptable.. .  . It wasn't very busybeing Christmas but we made our own party and the band and staff appreciated our efforts.  . . The food was good enough and the flavors were as expected.  The jeagerschnitzel wasn't the best I've had in Germany but it was good compared to the crap I've had in American "German" restaurants.  The gerkhin salat was great, pretzels were spot on and everyone cleaned their plate.. . Yes, the beer is a little expensive but it's brought in directly from Germany without having a different recipe like most "German" beers imported to the US, so there is additional cost involved.  It was great to be able to hold a 1 litre mug, singing with the band and swaying back and forth with everyone else in the bench seating.. . I WOULD say that coming just for food is a waste... the whole idea is to get in to the fun of being in a German beer hall.  So, if you're looking for a quiet evening out, please go to Joel Robuchon and leave the rest of us to drink and do the chicken dance :)
Though I've never had German food, this wasn't good. The food was salty and plain. Very over priced and not worth it. I wouldn't recommend to eat here,!stop in and take a look is good enough!!
Great place! We started off the vegas trip for a friend that is getting married here. The Liter beers were great but what was better was seeing the bachelor get spanked after taking a shot. priceless.. . I highly recommend this place. The food was pretty good too and they had a live band while we were there on a thursday night.
