Best filet mignon of my life...cooked to perfection with cajun spices. The wine list blew my socks off...and I am a viticulture/enology geek (in normal English...I am a wine snob). This, was in fact, the most impressive part of my meal here. I couldn't stop turning the pages of the wine list (evidently the largest wine list on the West Coast). The sides are unbelievable and complementary to the steak. I highly recommend the carrot cake for dessert. Emeril sure outdid himself here.
I want to give this place 2 stars, but because of the excellent service I'll bump it up to 3. The best thing about this place was the impeccable service received.  I dined here with my husband on a late Friday night.  The food here was just "OK". My breakdown of each dish is this:. . The Popovers: meh..they were ok. I think they were over cooked which made them a bit too dry and with a slightly burnt butter taste. I like Tyler Florence does a better version at Wayfare Tavern (SF).. . Appetizer special - Pappardelle w/ Crimini Mushrooms in a white wine sauce finished with parmigiana: Good stuff. Very light and tasty pasta, too many mushrooms for my liking, I would've preferred more pasta. Very small tasting plate so don't expect to get more than 3 or 4 bites.. . Creamed spinach: Another meh dish. I wanted more flavor here. Maybe a finish with butter would've helped. Some seasoning or something. Literally all I could taste was watery spinach.. . Twice Baled loaded Potatoes: YESSSSSS PLEASE! Now this was a great dish. Flavor in every bite. Perfect partner for my steak.. . Ribeye Steak (w/o bone) OSCAR STYLE w/ Jumbo Lump Crab Meat, Grilled Asparagus and Bearnaise.- I SOOOOOO wanted to love this steak. I really did. Order a my steak cooked medium and unfortunately it came out damn near rare. Like literally just short of bleeding. There was hardly any flavor.  The best part was the burnt edges as they actually added some flavor. I'd give my steak a 2/5, however, the Jumbo Lump crab and Bearnaise WAS THE BOMB!. . Smoked Pork chop: my husband truly enjoyed his pork chop. Tender with a smokey flavor all the way thru. The pork chop was huge! I'm not a big pork chop eater, but it was tasty. . . Pecan pie: Now this was worth the price of admission. A tasty warm & nutty pie with cold delicious ice cream. Mmmmm mmmmm good. I'd come here again just to eat this. A MUST have if you're ordering desserts.. . As previously mentioned in other reviews, the wine here is definitely over priced. I understand the mark ups restaurants need to make, but I think Delmonico's takes the "upcharge" to an entirely new level. We ordered a bottle of Kim Crawford's Sauvignon Blanc, which retails for about $18-20, we were charged $45 for the bottle!!! Talk about a rip off! Outside of opening the bottle and pouring the wine, what constitutes a $25 mark up?. . Needless to say I most likely won't return here. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think it was worth the price tag. I'd prefer to go back to Mario Batali's B&B, which is located directly across the walk way from Delmonico's.
Probably one of the best meals and service I have ever experienced. They operate on a team-style of service, though our main server, I believe his name was Mike was fantastic. Started a little slow, but we went above and beyond my expectations! Started with a bottle of champagne and then a bottle of red with dinner. They keep the bottles for you off the table, so you never pour on your own and your drink is never empty. Though we may have over-ordered the table-side Caesar and table-side chateaubriand were phenomenal. Perfectly prepared and delicious. I could not have enjoyed myself more! Thank you for an amazing date night in Vegas!
This was the steakhouse we decided to grub after my half marathon on the strip. I was concerned that my race attire didn't suit the ambiance and when we entered, we were welcomed. COOL! . . The staff was outstanding and very informative of the menu. We were led to a private corner booth which made our dinner even more special. We were offered menus and an iPad for our wine selections. I ordered a champagne to celebrate my last race of the year, and the fiancee ordered a glass of Justin cab (one of his faves).. . -We were offered comped bread (popover) and butter. LOVE THE SOFT BUTTER!!! . -Lobster bisque to share ($16). -Bone-in ribeye ($55). -Bone-in NY Strip ($50). -Twice Baked Potato ($9). -Duck Egg Creme Brulee ($11). . Steaks had a great rub on it and was topped with butter. YUP butter... Because I had the rib-eye, there was a lot of fat! YUM!!! I was only able to eat half my steak since it was so huge!!! The fiancee finished his NY. The potato was average and came with all the fixings on the side. I just wanted extra butter. Dinner was great.. . The dessert was a bit disappointing. We ordered the duck egg creme brulee since it was unique and highly recommended. At first the dessert was good, but after eating a couple more bites, the dessert started tasting a bit funny. It was so rich and I think the weird taste was getting to our tastebuds! Too bad there wasn't a molten lava cake!. . Service and ambiance was superb. Love walking through the Palazzo to get this restaurant! Beautiful!!!
First of all I've been here a couple of times and it was always a great meal with great service. In my opinion they have THE best steaks anywhere. This time it was my birthday and they went all out. We sat in the private backroom with a view of the kitchen. We had the chef's tasting menu in which the chef serves a 4 course meal of his choosing. It is hard to describe with out writing a short novel. Let me just summarize. We had a salad, seared tuna, lamb, and steak. It's The best meal and service I've ever had! It was like having a personal chef and complete wait staff just for us. We got a personal tour of the kitchen by the chef after dinner. Then after we were all stuffed to the gills, in comes every desert they have to offer and just about everyone on staff to sing "Happy Birthday". Everyone was so personable. I felt like they were all my friends. They would do whatever it takes to make you happy! Yes! it's pricy, but so worth it. My only regret was not wearing elastic pants.
Delmonico serves up superb cuts of meat!  I'd recommend going with the bone-in ribeye... so tender, juicy, and flavorful!  And don't skimp on the sides, order at least 2-3 even if it's just for a party of 2.  I loved the caesar salad.  There's something nice about slicing your own leaves of romaine in a salad.. . The service here is nice and efficient.  It's what you would expect when dining at a restaurant of this calibre.
Steak was cooked to perfection. Service in general excellent!
My husband and I dined here for my 40th birthday. We were treated like royalty and loved every minute. He had the chateaubriand and I had the salmon. Both were incredible. I can't wait to visit Vegas again just to eat here!
I've walked by Delmonico and stopped to look at the menu many times as I've gone through restaurant row on my way to/from the parking garage at the Palazzo.  With a show later, I made an early reservation for Delmonico.  I was promptly greeted and seated.. . I knew the steaks were large unless I got a petit filet (not my favorite cut of steak) so I ordered a bone in ribeye, a side of cheesy grits with bacon, and then bread pudding for dessert. I had a trio of servers who took good care of service.  . . I ordered the steak cooked blue and it was close to that but a bit beyond.  The steak was quite average.  The steak was pre-seasoned and it was OK.  The star of dinner was the cheesy grits with bacon.  They were very good!. . The bread pudding was white chocolate macadamia nut with creme Anglaise.  It was OK, too.. . The dinner never had any wow factor to merit the prices charged.  Things were average except the grits.  I thought the dried branches on the poinsettia on the wall by my table reflected the lack of attention to detail one would expect of a high end restaurant like Delmonico.  . . Service was very good and the servers were friendly but I left feeling somewhat disappointed.  Well, at least they're be no need to stop and peruse the menu anymore.
Oh good lawwwwd....did someone say STEAKKK?!?!. . I recently came to Vegas from DC for a bachelor party and this was our one "nice" meal for the weekend. I decided to eat the Wagyu and it came with mashed sweet potato. It was sooo good. Cooked awesomely by the chef. What made it even better was eating it with the many sides we ordered. Surprisingly I loved the cream of spinach, but my favorite side was the potato gratin. Unfortunately there are so many different places to eat in Vegas...I don't know if I'll ever get to come back here.. . Def need to try it at least once!
Wanted something good for my girl since it was our 1 yr. Made a super easy quick reservation using yelp for 7:30pm. Arrived 15 minutes early and was promptly greeted and seated in a nice corner section. Had the pan seared foie gras for appetizer. The main was the bone-in ribeye medium on the pink side and went with the Oscar style, jumbo lump crab meat, grilled asparagus and bearnaise. Also had the country smashed potatoes and a must have cream corn gratinee. We shared everything and still had left overs. Service was great and food was on par. Will definitely come back.
I've been here a few times.... All I have to say is....Finally a place that knows how make a steak!  I came here for dinner and lunch.  I also had a chance to try their burger. The juiciest and tastiest burger I have ever had. I would definitely come back for future meals as well as recommend this place to others.
Major letdown. Maybe quality of food have went down.. . Came here for bachelor party. Had a private room. Pork chop was better than the ribeye and tbone.. . Foie gras was on menu but i didn't  care too much for. Better off with bacon appetizer. Quite good.. . Seafood tower was lacking in quality.
The food was okay/good and service was great.  The service made our okay meal a better experience. When my bf and I were first seated, we were asked if we were celebrating anything. We told them our anniversary and was served a complimentary amuse-bouche and sorbet dessert at the end.. . Yay:. -Truffle Parmesan potato chips: freshly made and amazing in flavor. You can taste all the elements of this working well together. I thought the truffle oil was going to overwhelm the dish but it was nicely perfumed throughout and complimented the freshly grated Parmesan. The chips were thin, crispy and airy. I almost ate the whole thing before my meal but had to stop myself. . . Other:. -Ribeye steak special: the special of the day was a petite rib eye with foie gras. The steak otherwise would have been bland had it not been for the foie gras. It was perfectly cooked to my medium rare preference. . -Ribeye: my bf got the regular ribeye without the special and it come out to be almost the same size as my petite filet. It was slightly seasoned more than mine. However when we reheated the leftover steaks, mine held up better and the foie gras melted into the meat flavoring it better than this one. . -Mashed potatoes: just regular, nothing fancy.
Food: (3/5) "For quality and taste, go to another steakhouse". The bone in ribeye ($55) was mediocre, not as good and tenderized as I expected. . I come from Northern California and steakhouses like Flemings or Alexander's offer far better steaks. I even thought that Texas Roadhouse was a better steak and better cooked.. Price for the ribeye is average for a steakhouse.. Ordered it medium-rare and came in a bit over cooked. I didn't find much of the broiled flavor to it. . . Service: (3/5) - "Not worth the $100 gratuity..". The waiter was not very sociable and a bit to dry. We initially got the attention/service you'd expect from a restaurant like this, but . . during the middle of the dinner our waiter disappeared on us. The first time we needed him it took us a while to get him, and the second time I couldn't wait anymore and directly stood up to find him. . . . Environment: (5/5) "the best amenity in this restaurant". Pretty decor. Well dressed staff. Nice colors.. Very comfy.I'm
We were seated promptly for our 5:30 p.m. reservation on Monday, 12/29/2014. Front of house service was exceptional. The food took a while to make it to the table, which was a little surprising as the restaurant was not busy. My wife loved her filet. My bone in ribeye was good, but by far not the best I've had. The meat was over fatty. The sides were very tasty, including the asparagus and the twice baked potato. I would go again, but I'd order the filet instead of the ribeye.
