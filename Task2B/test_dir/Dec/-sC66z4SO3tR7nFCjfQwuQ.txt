Gallo Blanco is a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix that serves up some quality Mexican cuisine.  No Tex Mexhere, instead you can find street style tacos, a creative elote, and some pretty good happy hour specials.. . My Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return). . Atmosphere - Gallo Blanco is adjacent to the Clarenden hotel, so if it's your first time you might miss it.  Inside you'll find an open and modern space that matches the food perfectly.  There's also plenty of outdoor seating and bright colors everywhere and a bar if you're looking for more than tacos.  1 Star.. . Service - Our servers were great.  Even though the food took some time to come out, they checked in often.  We sat outside on a cold fall afternoon, but our outdoor heater was out of fuel.  They were kind enough to move a working lamp to accommodate us.  1 Star.. . Food - Get the elote.  Gallo Blanco serves this up on a whole corn, placing the sour cream and spices on top.  You then strip the corn off directly.  It looks amazing, tastes great, and was a really creative way to serve elote.  I liked it more because it limited the amount of sour cream.  The guacamole was also great.  Fresh, and with pineapples mixed in.  They used big chunks too, and I thought it was great.  They tacos were good not great.  The beef reminds me of Korean bugolgi marinated beef.  It was sweet (which is ok with me).  Shrimp and fish tacos while fresh, weren't any more memorable that other places I've been too.  So while the appetizers were great, our tacos weren't as good.  1 Star. . . Will I Return? - Yes.  Kids eat free, and they have great happy hour specials.  I'd return for those reasons and the elote/guac.  Gallo Blanco is solid, cool, and definitely worth a return visit.  1 Star.. . My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):. 1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.. 1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.. 2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.. 1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. . . Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.
What can I say about Gallo Blanco.  The food is always awesome and very non traditional.  Great place for a first date, meal with friends and family, or just for happy hour drinks and appetizer's.  The best part are the urinals in the men's room. Very popular place that everyone has to see, I always have to take the women in to show them cause they all want to see the unique urinals.  It's OK.... everyone does it!  I know the owner and the several of the staff of the hotel and they are all awesome and this is the best kept secret for hotel lodging and eating in Central Phoenix.  Very Highly recommended!!!!
Roof top bar was a nice touch! Tacos were delicious. Guacamole and Elote were Devine! Pasole was slightly cold, okay flavor. Tried my husbands torta and it was also great! Tres leche cake was okay but the brownie cake was much better.
Just ate here...taco was not bad, burrito was cold. Service was pretty good but they were confused by my order of a side of guacamole. Stumbled onto all day hh which was pretty nifty but it would have been nice if they told me sooner
Really good food, small space, great service. Delicious appetizers, fun environment and the Clarendon Hotel is a great space.
It looks super hip and it should be amazing but the food was just okay. Our appetizer was a huge grease fest, we asked if it was supposed to be that way and they took it off our bill but not really ever answered the question. We never got refills on any drinks. They were not that busy either. Perhaps we didn't fit their normal crowd of people but I was bummed, it looked fun but I will pass next time.
Always great. This place rocks! Best elote ever.  Come on a Wednesday for some flamenco dancing!
Excellent chips and salsa - worth coming here just for that.  I think there are better tacos in town but I look forward to trying other items on the menu.
Maybe it's that we showed up on a Sunday night, but I thought the food was lackluster. However highlights include the many salsas that arrived at the table, and the house made tortilla chips. The pork was dry/overcooked. The Shrimp and grits came highly recommend, but was just... Okay. They do sell pitchers of beer though!
I eat there all the time. Great service and great food.
Absolutely incredible. Had huevos rancheros and a tamale today. The best. The ice tea is great also. What a fun dining experience. The staff is incredible also.

Absolutely delicious!! My husband had Posole, I had the Ensalada Cortado, and we shared the most delicious corn on the cob (Callejero) ever!!!! Tea was delicious!! Wonderful service and fantastic atmosphere!!
Food is decent, however the customer service is absolutely great.
I honestly think Gallo Blanco is the best restaurant I ate in Phoenix. The food was great quality, service was fantastic... they served real maple syrup! Everything! Breakfast by far stood out over the competition around phoenix. Lunch and dinner were also solid. Decent food.
Really happy we decided to try this place for dinner tonight. We're staying at the Clarendon, so when we were told it was a 20 minute wait we went up to the room and they texted us when our table was ready, which I thought was super convenient. . . Guacamole was great, as we expected. The shrimp tacos were out of this world.. Very delicious. I would come back just for those. They were out of flan so we got an ice cream brownie for dessert which was okay. All the servers were really nice. . Overall a pleasant experience.
Right next to the office. Excellent carne asada burrito.  Great salads !! . Cool place with really cool history.
