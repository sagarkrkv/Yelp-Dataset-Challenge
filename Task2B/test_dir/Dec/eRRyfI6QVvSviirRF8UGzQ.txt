This review is for their room service food.  The hotel was great, but if you don't try room service, you're missing a great experience.. . I had the nachos.  I had them last year, and we decided to stay at the Encore again for the nachos!  Crisp, thin, warm chips with just the right amount of salt, served in a hot, heavy Le Creuset au gratin pan so they stay warm.  A two- cheese sauce also served in a hot Le Creuset dish with sliced jalapenos, diced tomatoes and delicious olives was mild but  very tasty.  Separate dishes of pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole round out the serving.  Everything was fresh and plentiful, and worth the trip back.. . My wife had the beef sliders.  Substantial beef patties cooked to perfection, served on fresh Hawaiian rolls.  The onion rings were also perfectly produced, achieving that balance of crisp, golden brown batter and flavorful but not overpowering onion flavor.. . Our daughter had the BLT with the thickest, chewiest bacon you have ever seen.  She said it was the best BLT she ever had.. . With tip and a few soft drinks our bill came to $97.  For room service and top-notch food, it was a good deal.   Our server said that the room service kitchen is stand-alone, so they don't offer the same food in any of their restaurants (although we found similar bacon at Zoozacrackers here at Encore).
Beautiful especially around the holidays.
See my other review that I just posted.
My partner and I enjoy coming to Vegas for a fun getaway. The Encore is by far #1! We checked in on a Monday and when we arrived we waiting in line maybe five minutes. The rooms are spacious, clean and relaxing. Soft bedding, large soak tub, couch and flip tv. Oh and of course a tv in the bathroom for when you're rexlaxing in a bubble bath. Lets not forget the bedside light/shade touch pad. Even the small things such as shoe polish and q-tips in the bathroom were such a lovely touch. The windows are floor to ceiling, so its really an incredible view. We stayed on the 14th floor. Wish we would've gotten a higher floor though. The staff was incredibly friendly and accomodating. Shout out to Carol n the casino floor at Wynn. She was awesome. We didn't play at the Encore, but my partner enjoys poker, so he hit up the poker room at Wynn.The only negative for me was the walk. Its a pretty good one. All in all, the Encore is an excellent place to stay!
For the *Casino* not hotel. Great Casino, less crowded and lower minimums than the Wynn. This place has the amenities, style and service as the Wynn. It is less crowed and has lower table minimums which I prefer. Keep in mind it is a pretty far walk to the Wynn, via a retail shop walkway. There is an access close to the strip which is kind of hidden, just look for the beach club entrance.
We got a King tower suite on the 29th floor with a city view.  The floor to celing windows make this room. The view was really nice even if it was just a "city view". We also had a decent view of the golf course. . . The bed was AMAZING!! I mean AMAZING! So comfy, the sheets, the perfectly weighted down comforter huge comfy pillows. It was just perfect. The bed it self was perfect I had a hard time pulling myself out of it in the morning..I swear to you I could have skipped everything else and just stayed in bed..Did I mention the bed was AMAZING! !. . The bathroom was great. It had a deep soak tub but i found it a little short. I'm 5'10 and well it was a short fit, but still very relaxing. The towels were plentiful, thick and oversized which was nice. Although they were a bit rough. Also the bathrobes they provide were in kind of rough shape. One had a weird yellowish tinted stain on it and the terry fabric inside was as rough as the towels. . . Okay so outside of the room the entire resort is beautiful. We ate at "The Buffett" and I hate to say this but overall I was slightly disappointed.  The salad portion of the very long buffet was a big let down. The greens were wilted. The "Red and white quinoa salad was nice. The macaroni salad just made me sad. Very bland and seemed to have been setting out a long time. The highlight was the blue cheese dressing.. The cheese and salami station is worth skipping, nothing impressive. . The turkey, and prime rib were very good. Especially the turkey.  Very tender and flavorful. . I also tried the Chipotle bbq meatloaf which was yummy. The kobe beef burger were good. I thought they were a bit on the bland side.  The bbq pork bun and chicken pot stickers were both a big let down. The bun was really, really dry and the filling was almost nonexistent.  . The street tacos were really good as well. . They have a really nice desserts section my favorite by far was the blood orange Panna Cotta. . . We also got to see the Show "Showstoppers" which is basically a musical mash-up of a few different famous Broadway shows including "Chicago" (All that Jazz, and Cell block Tango) the latter being my favorite performance of the show.  The also did a number from Cabearet (Money). Damn Yankees (The Game). .  Hello Dolly (Put on your Sunday clothes)  There were a few other song sung by the lead members inbetween the big numbers including "Anything I can do" Which is a really fun number the interaction between the two leads during this song is great. They really played well against each other. The finale was A Chorus Line..I know im forgetting several numbers and that's because they were very forgetable. The one thing that really sucked about the show was Steve Wynn's voice overs..They were completely unnecessary. His booming voice jus takes you right out if the moments of being at an old time Vegas show.. . Overall this was a great stay. The staff is not only very helpful and friendly but seem to actually enjoy their jobs.. We will definitely be staying here again... . Did I mention the beds are AMAZING!!!
I have to hand it to the Encore.  They did contact me after my previous challenges and they set everything straight- including dropping my resort fee after the 99 person line.   I really appreciate the follow up and customer attention and care.  Now I want to go back!
What a marvelous experience. This property is still the equal of the Four Seasons/Ritz Carlton crowd, and of course you'll pay for it. A sausage and eggs breakfast in room will cost you $32 for the entree alone so a big breakfast for two will be $100. But when you consider that it arrives fresh and hot on fine linen with quality flatware, you see where the money goes.There are no little plastic packets of Heinz ketchup; its glass and china all the way.. . Not quite as picky on the little touches as they were in the day Steve Wynn was more involved in the day-to-day operation (some lights were out in the suite), but problems were fixed quickly and correctly.. . This is a great choice if you like elegance and things done right. The poker room is very nice; not the size of some more involved in the poker scene, but still a great place to play. . . Can't wait to go back.
What a view! Our room faced the south side which had the view of the strip and the golf course. The front desk gave us the heads up about the noise from their two night clubs at night; a little muffled thumping noise but hardly a nuisance. Encore was quieter and much more relaxed than other big casino hotels. I would love to go back if I can afford to stay here.
