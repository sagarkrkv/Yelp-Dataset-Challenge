My friends and I were in town for a bachelorette party (as were 95% of the people we met), and the night we spent at Tryst was the most fun I've had in a while.. . We got in for free on a club promoter's list with a few free drink vouchers each for all 8 of us. It was exactly how I had imagined a Las Vegas club to be: it has a fun and suggestive name, fog, flashing lights, beautiful people, great music, and, to top it off, a view of a waterfall right next to the dance floor.. . Simple mixed drinks were about $14 each. You didn't have to wait long to get one. There are tables for bottle service surrounding the dance floor and in another room next to it (brighter and quieter,  if you'd rather talk and see who you're talking to). . . My friends and I had a blast, and I have no complaints about Tryst whatsoever. It's a nice place without being too pretentious. I'll definitely visit again the next time I'm in town!
Disappointed with this club!! It's like XS but smaller and people aren't even dancing! I also dislike how this and XS plays nothing but EDM!! It's like a couple of clubs play HIp Hop, I think it's a Vegas thing honestly.
The four stars is for the layout it was amazing!! I'm from Texas and we just don't see places like this or this big! I love that it wasn't too packed there was room to walk and dance. They had an awesome stage to dance on in the VIP area. Their are tons of VIP sections that all range in size. We were also free because we are locals. You do have to have your Vegas ID though. Don't know about drink prices though because I was only there for about 45 minutes or so. The DJ was dope! Definitely say come here for a good time!
Tryst is an attractive and "pretty" nightclub but management and security are horrible and they are liars.  I took a group to Las Vegas this past Labor Day.  I bought a table and was told about a deal but I had to bring at least 10 people.  I did.  When I got there, I discovered that the table we had could not accommodate all of us.  Only about 4 people could sit, 4 very thin people.  I was told that it was "club seating" and that we should not have expected to all be able to sit.  . . That's why we bought the table - nobody buys a table so that they can stand.  That's the whole point of getting a table!  . . When I first asked to have the managercome over before giving up the seat they said belonged to the neighboring table, security threatened to kick me out if I didn't stand immediately. We were treated like shit enough that a few of us left after already having paid $100 each for this table.. . Don't buy a table if you have more than 4 people in your party and don't expect any help or decency from this staff of assholes.
