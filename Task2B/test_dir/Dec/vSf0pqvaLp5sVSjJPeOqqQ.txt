Mediocre and I am being kind. Appetizer chips were burnt. My lobster salad had a lot of lobster but dressing was nothing to write home. Fish and chips had to go back. Batter was not done and when returned tasted to much of vinegar. Way to expensive. I will never go back to another Todd English place. I have tried them for years and the odds are that it is not good.
Had an amazing lunch yesterday! Great food an even better service! Cameron was an amazing server! We are back again today and plan to come again before our vacation is over! Everything on the menu is delicious! Seriously haven't tried one thing I didn't enjoy! I really wish we had a Todd English in South Carolina!!
Great food and great service.  One of my favorite places during my stay in Vegas!  Cameron was an excellent waiter and kept us coming back!  I don't review restaurants very often, but this place is just too good not to share.
The food was not good and was exceptionally overpriced. I had the Brie grilled cheese with a side of onion rings. The sandwich was bland and the onion rings were just bad (think giant and soggy with a big slimy onion that comes out entirely with one bite.) My date got the fish and chips which were equally as bland as the sandwich. The duck buns and skinny fries were the only decent thing we had. The do have good bloody marys as well.
How can I explain the 3 different waiters we had and the 40 minute  wait? Well, we were told our order was cancelled but it had been put in again. Oh, but don't worry because you ordered a medium rare burger and it doesn't take long. . . All in all, this place is expensive mediocre food but crappy service. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!!
If you like waiting 40 mins before getting any food and watching your waiter shoot the breeze with another waiter this is the place to go.
Came here last Sunday around 10pm for their happy hour as part of my boyfriend's birthday after eating at Gordon Ramsey's Steak. The best parking would be to valet at Aria since this place is right between Aria and Crystal's. 4 stars mainly because I liked the atmosphere, it's the fanciest version of a P.U.B I've ever seen lol. With their extensive beer menu and 7-second challenge, I could definitely see this as a spot for the guys or any girls that really like beer. I'm mainly a specialty cocktail type person so it's not exactly a go-to spot for me. . . Happy hour: 3-6pm & 10pm-Midnight every day!. -1/2 off pints. -1/2 wines by the glass. -$1 wings. -$2 oysters. -$3 sliders. . I loved both of their red and white sangria and my friends enjoyed the wings and oysters. One of my girlfriends said their sliders were alright.. I still want to come back here though to possibly try their P.U.B favorites like their foot long hot dog, cioppino, smore's board and their lobster benedict off their brunch menu.
I went for the fish and chips today. Ate the whole thing and was definitely full. All the servers wear their favorite sports team jersey. I didn't have the burgers, but I heard that on the bread. Next time I come here I'll try the burgers. The portions are very large.
This was such a great find! My boyfriend and I stopped in today for happy hour. Still functioning on east coast time, the 3:00-6:00 PM time slot was really dinner for us. We were attracted to the large menu and half-priced draft pints. Little did we know that they are also doing a "Twelve Beers of Christmas," with a new draft every day until Christmas for $2.00. So amazing! We scored Winter Lager (Sam Adams) for ridiculously cheap... you just don't find that on the strip.. . We ordered twelve oysters from the raw bar to start and they did not disappoint. Fresh horseradish, cocktail sauce, lemon wedges, and another sauce which was Asian-inspired accompanied them. Super fresh, salty, and a decent size made this Carolina girl (read: oyster snob) a fan. I also ordered a wedge salad and was really impressed by it. Bacon vinaigrette, bacon pieces, fresh tomatoes and avocado, chopped egg, and blue cheese equals serious wedge perfection. I ate the entire thing. My boyfriend had the grilled bologna and thought the sandwich was great. The only downside was that it said it was served with kettle chips but they were no where to be found. Service was attentive at the bar but also a little sporadic, so he chose to just let that slip up go and not ask about them.. . Overall, the food was great and the fact we found $2.00 draft beers is a miracle. We'll be back (as in tomorrow, to see what is next on their "twelve beers" list). Happy to have found this place!
Great place to go to for an inexpensive, low key night. My husband and I decided to come here for a late dinner during the 10p-12a happy hour, and very happy we did. We ordered a dozen chicken wings, 3 sliders, the fried pickles, an oyster, and 4 pints of beer and got out here for LESS than $50 ... you can't go wrong with that. . . Chicken wings were nice and crispy, but a little on the small side, and I wish they had more sauces. Sliders were awesome, ordered and got a perfect medium mini burger, dressed in thousand island and caramelized onions. YUM. The fried pickles were very good as well, but a HUGE portion, and we just couldn't get through them. The pickles are a mixture (sweet and dill), the fried sweet pickles threw me off a little, but the dill chips were great. My husband tried an oyster for the first time, and the waitress walked him through the whole process and what he should put on it. Needless to say, she made him a fan :) . . This place has a ton of beers, but unfortunately about 3 of the beers my husband tried to order were not available that night. Service was great though, food came out fast and overall it was nice place to relax, eat and drink.
Great spot. Solid food. One of the best beer menus in Vegas and bartenders that are knowledgeable and accommodating. Kris and Jaime were fantastic. Knowledgeable, accommodating, a lot of fun. When in Vegas, don't miss this spot.
On a recent visit to Vegas we stayed at the Aria and the PUB is right next door.  It was nice to have something close that wasn't as expensive as everything in the Aria.  It was nice enough to sit outside, which was a cute patio and it was nice to spend some time outside.  It was happy hour so we got cheap wings and oysters.  We got just a few oysters to start, but since we loved them so much we got a few more after eating the wings.  I love the asian sauce they with them that was different then what other places serve.  The wings were good, but the oysters we remembered more.  It was a perfect late day snack.  They have a great beer selection with discounted pints during happy hour.  I definitely recommend and the service was great too!
Mini corn dogs were tasty! How will I ever compare after having my 1st Bloody Mary here at brunch! It was a meal in its own!
Get stuffed!  Literally.. . Not health food.  Large portions deep fried or with fat and juices from properly roasted joins, added calories from cheeses and spreads; this is Vegas.  Straight forward British pub grub paired with very well chosen selections of beers on tap.. . The carvery is the focus.  Select half or a full pound of the protein, bread and two sauces.  Simples.  Do select heartier breads (sandwich breads turn to mush).  Stick to simple sauces (black truffle mayo or horseradish scour cream) if you want to accentuate the roasted flavors of the proteins.  Proteins themselves are perfectly cooked remembering that this is NOT a Jewish deli.  Outstanding, brisket.  Dripping with juices, deep flavor, just the right amount of fat.  The lamb, cooked mid rare has a mild lamb flavor.  Finally, the duck confit with its good thyme scented backbone.  Moist and crisp when heated.  All good eats.  All sandwiches are accompanies by a crock of pickled root veg.  The very strong acidic finish is required to cut through the fatty goodness of the sandwiches.. . Great starters include a simple white wine steamed clams with apple wood smoked bacon.  The fat from the bacon imparts a great richness and flavor to the clams.  The steamed PEI mussels are also very well done.  Tender, just cooked through with a great spicy tomato broth.  The accompanying garlic aioli and crispy fried cherry peppers adds the right amount of complexity and heat to keep the palate alive.. . Standard pub fare (fish and chips; very good with perfectly cooked, heavily battered, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, with a nice side of fluffy chips and mushy peas and the grilled banger and mash with its deeply caramelized onion gravy) are great.. . Excellent service bordering on off Strip Vegas local (real people living real lives).. . Great energy and pub ambiance.  Crack the peanuts and throw the shells on the ground, bar games for free beers if you can finish in a crazy short time, games on nice and loud and the energy of the guest.. . Note:  Outstanding happy hour and reverse happy hour with half off all beers and wine.  . . Many, many repeat visits.  Always consistent.. . Cheeers!
This place is incredible. The best bar food you could ask for. I have been here 6 times so far and everything I have tried is great. Their brunch is my favorite and the "Lobster eggs Benny" is amazing! They have a RIDICULOUS bloody Mary bar with the most incredible make your own menu I have ever seen. Their happy hour is great, with great deals on sliders and wings and beer. I could go on for a wile about this place, try it. . .it's a bit pricey for bar food, but you won't be disappointed.
We went here the other night and were really excited because it has been SO hyped up the past year or so. We went on a Tuesday night thinking the wait wouldn't be crazy (we tried before only to here there was a 3 hour wait) and to our surprise there was still a 2 hour wait. We did wait though and had a few beers at the bar and chatted with the bartender who was cool. The food was good, but nothing special, and a little pricier than we would have liked. The space is amazing and worth taking a look at. Go. But, if the wait is forever...go elsewhere.
After reading the reviews, I had to find out what all the buzz was about. A couple of Boddingtons and a lobster roll later, I am convinced that the rave reviews are completely justified. Best lobster roll this side of Boston! Super fast service and a great atmosphere. A bit pricey but worth it.
Awesome pub! Very cool feel and decor inside the restaurant. Didn't get to look outside. The pickle fries were good with minimal breading. They came with three sauces, and the chipotle sauce was very good. The prime rib sandwich was amazing with the French dip and onions. The prices were typical for Vegas, although not insane. A better deal than what you can get at the surrounding restaurants. The Todd English P.U.B. is a great lunch choice, especially for those who like beer.
Best red sangria ever. The oysters are very fresh and the cioppino was outstanding. The frites are worth the calories .
