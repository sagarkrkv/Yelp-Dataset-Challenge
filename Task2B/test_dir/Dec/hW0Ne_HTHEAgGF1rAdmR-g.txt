Pretty average for a big-city airport: mostly chain restaurants, shops are over-priced and filled with mostly junk. And no, it doesn't have to be this way.. . Takes quite a bit of time to get to the off-site rental car terminal. When you're returning your rental, make sure you stop and fill up well before you get anywhere near the airport. I took the 101 to the 202 and when I exited could not find any filling stations near the airport. When I looked on GasBuddy, I didn't see anything within a mile. Added an extra half hour that would have made me miss my flight if I had not left a bit early.
Traveling from PHX to Chicago Midway on 11/29/14 via Southwest and my 70 year old Aunt & Uncle's luggage was sent on an earlier flight. They arrived at PHX airport at 9:30am for their 1:00pm flight and their luggage went on the wrong flight (it went on the 11:30 flight). . When it arrived at Chicago's Midway Airport we were told it would be  held for them at baggage claim 7 and would be secured and locked. Upon their arrival at midnight, it was NOT secured or locked up. WHY did go on the wrong flight? Why did Southwest overbook the flight causing 2 senior citizens to be bumped off their flight???? They arrived in Chicago 8-9 hours LATE!
Phoenix Sky Harbor has gotten so much better in the past few years.  All of the great restaurants inside are awesome!  All local places that will give you a great taste of what the valley has to offer.  The tram system is making things much better to get from the economy parking lot.  It still lacks some improvements to terminal 4, but it's on the right track.  The flow of the airport is very seamless and you can't get lost.  Nice job to those in charge of making this airport a great stopping destination for travelers.
This airport is pretty poorly organized. Really spread out so if you don't like the restaurant options near your gate, you'll need about 45 minutes to walk to and from another area. There are also very few outlets to charge your devices so keep your eyes open for one and take what's available. But , there is free wifi so that's nice!
This airport is very poorly layed out.  Additionally, the rental car facility is a long way from the airport.  If you are returning a car plan on an extra 30min to be safe.  There are few good places for food or drinks so the ones that are decent are always packed.. . On a personal note, I had a fun run in with one of the purple jacketed "ambassadors".  I walked up to one of these folks to ask how to get to the A gates from where I was.  He said "they are down there to the right, now move along".  He must have been a retired cop with that phrasing and bad attitude.  It is also a bad comment on an airport's layout in that you need guides like this at intersections.
I'm particularly adverse to this airport. Perhaps it is because I feel like I always have to spend so much time here when I just want to get to my destination. Yet, there are many other airports that I would prefer to spend my layover time at. The biggest problem that I have with Sky Harbor is the layout. If you need to get from one gate to another, or you're looking for food between flights, you could easily end up walking a mile or more due to the poor layout design. As a generalization the airport is set up in an extended 'E' shape, but with more than three appendages. This means that instead of walking through a central hub towards another branch of the airport, you can't avoid taking the longest possible route. It's true that in past years, the services, stores, and restaurants have been upgraded. Honestly, thank goodness. As US Airways is absorbed by American Airlines, this airport is becoming an even more important hub than it was. Hopefully, you won't have to walk too far.
love phx!
I typically fly in and out of terminal 4 and have to say, I really think this airport is one of the best!  There is always a huge selection of places to eat, lines are always pretty quick through security and it is a pretty new terminal so it seems clean and nice.. . There are plenty of parking options, whether on site, off site with a shuttle or off site with the new phx sky train.
Its ok. Its an airport, and a stereotypical one at that. It has long lines and a lot of traffic, expensive chain restaurants, and shops. Nothing special. Customer Service is passable and they do a good job as expected, however it is a typical airport. No muss or fuss.
The real only plus for this airport is they give you free wi-fi. I wouldn't say though that there were any negatives other than the baggage took a while. Security wasn't too bad. I was in the B terminal and there isn't a great selection of food and drink places. All around it is just an average airport.
I've only transferred through the PHO a couple times (so I can't comment on the security), but I think it's just A-OK. . . Highlights. +Gates have plush seats.. +Not overwhelmingly large, so going from terminal to another isn't too bad. (Vy is absolutely right.). +Free WiFi.. +The mountains surrounding the airport are gorgeous. . . Drawbacks:. -I understand that airports have their fair share of chains, but this one seems to have slightly more.. -Bathrooms are kind of bleh.. -Not enough seats at gates. (Saw too many people sitting on the ground waiting for their flights.). -Too many people riding on the golf carts and drivers not telling people to get out of the way. (Like me.). . This airport is the definition of mediocrity.
This is a pretty good airport. I do like that they have better restaurants than the typical airport. The location is convenient and it is very easy to find your way around even though it is a pretty large airport. Security is also usually pretty fast. It's like having the convenience of a small airport but the service of a large one
This airport is absolutely ridiculous! If this is your first time be prepared for a nightmare. First off, ask the volunteers!! They are a tremendous help and are knowledgeable about all aspects of the airport and know where everything is! . . Do not ask the people who actually work there, they do not know anything and are of no help to you. The only thing you will get from them is dirty looks when you interrupt their cell phone conversations and blank expressions. . . If you can help it, avoid this airport at all costs!!
I only tend to notice an airport when I have had a horrible experience. Even then, it's usually the weather or an airline or the TSA that was the source of the problem. . . Sky Harbor is large and impersonal, but it makes an effort to make time spent here less painful. . . The recent upgrade in food options, including local phoenix options, is a huge improvement. Matt's, Lo-Lo's... though still overpriced for the captive audience.. . The Sky Train, which connects the three terminals at a cost of over a billion dollars (not a joke), is great entertainment for kids and helpful for travelers switching airlines. A billion plus dollars entertaining and helpful? Well.... . Also, there are some interesting art installations scattered around the airport. Keep an eye out for them.. . Sky Harbor has three terminals (2,3,4) and the distances, even within terminals (Terminal 4), can be large. The Sky Train and conveyor walkways help, but allow extra time. Terminal One was closed years ago, so don't let that confuse you. Too bad. It would be a popular mid-century modern destination if it were still in existence today.
Better than most.  Terminal 2 / United faster to get to for checking in than southwest.  Nice United club,  Gates all close.
Always a great airport to fly into for a layover.. Good food, easy to get around and if you have time to kill, you can really get some good walking exercise in pretty easily.. . They could use some more bathrooms in the various terminal areas....they get crowded pretty quick.. . The Barrio Cafe is by far the best place to eat in the D Terminal.
Im not going to give an airport more than 3 stars but this is a 5 star airport.. . Its clean. Its fast. Its BIG (HUGE). It has lots of stores and food places. All the ammenities, and super fast security.. . If you must make a 2-stop, this is the place to do it as it connects everywhere and is a hub for most majors.
The people are friendly. The airport, however, is not conducive to finding your way around easily or quickly. Plan well if you have layovers here.
Over the years they've made major improvements to make this a more convenient airport and I would say they've done quite a good job at it.
I fly into Sky Harbor quite a bit. Althought it's not the worst, it's not even close to one of my favorite airports - I prefer DFW (gasp!) over this one. . . First issue - way croweded most of the time - everywhere. It's sometimes difficult to find a place to sit. Second, the food selection is OK outside of TSA. Once inside it is limited and the places they do have are really crowded. Finally, getting a car rental is really a pain. You have to take a 10 minute shuttle bus to the rental hub. All similar to DFW except DFW has some pretty good eateries and places to just sit - it's much bigger. I have to say, TSA pre-check here is pretty quick though.
Its the airport, my second home. . . One of the best airports in my opinion when it comes to activities, restaurants (its like you never left Scottsdale), and shopping. Most everyone there is friendly and its easy to navigate.
My grandmother used to take us here when we were kids. We would watch the planes, look at the weird Southwestern crap in the gift shop (suckers with worms...mmm...), run down the moving sidewalks, and drive up and down the weird twirling parking garage ramps. That was pre 9/11, of course. So this place is full of memories for me.. . They continue to make improvements to this place, some of which are welcome, like free Wi-Fi and the light rail, and some of which are not, like the planned demolition of Terminal 2, which dates back to maybe the 1960s?. . Shops and restaurants are plentiful, and exhaustively so, just like they are in the Valley. TSA reps are usually friendly,  and I like the team of purple-shirted volunteers who stand around waiting for questions. Which is helpful, since the place is sprawling.. . The views of the mountains never gets old, so I like the generally open layout. Also the carpet (see photo) is fun.
This is one of my favorite airports for a couple of main reasons:. . 1. Easy TSA process. 2. Fabulous restaurants. 3. Easy navigation around entire airport including parking outside. 4. Extremely efficient pick up/drop off areas with plenty of space for everyone. . . To expand on each thing that I really enjoy.... . TSA Process:. I frequently travel with just one carry on item and it's generally a process. I'm a frequent flier so I know how to breeze through the lines, if the airport recognizes this and lets me.  By that I mean doesn't stick me in a super long line behind people with a ton of baggage (or kids). (Sorry but it's true!)  Sky Harbor seems to "get" this more than other airports and frequently sends me and other people who don't have many items into a smaller, more quickly moving line.  Perhaps I'm totally wrong about this and it's just luck but it's something I've noticed after flying out of PHX dozens fo times.  . . Awesome Restaurants:. Normally airports suck at food- they'll try to have options but instead of offering great restaurants they give you shitty options.  (I'm not sure which I'd rather have- no options or shitty options... probably shitty options.) Sky Harbor has a lot of options that are not shitty- not at all!  For example, last year they put in a Matt's Big Breakfast- if you're not from Phx or haven't visited or lived there for a period of time you probably don't know about the gem downtown that is Matt's big breakfast.  It is an awesome breakfast spot with bacon that is almost a half of an inch thick.  YEAH.  There are awesome food places in Sky Harbor and I always try to get there early just to eat.  A funny tidbit.... last year I was flying on Thanksgiving day and ended up having my Thanksgiving dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen outside of the TSA checkpoint at Sky Harbor- haha!. . Easy Navigation: . . This one is pretty straightforward so the point I'll focus on here is that they are a stop on the light rail that runs all across the Valley.  I have frequently used this system and have found it foolproof.  Rarely to I trust public transportation when trying to get somewhere with a tight timeframe but I absolutely trust the light rail system with the Sky Harbor drop off points.  . . Pick Up/ Drop Off Areas:. . Long story short (I've already written a novel- about an AIRPORT - I'm crazy.) they have really easy pick up drop off areas that are heavily monitored for stalling and it makes it really easy to get space to get in or out of the airport quickly! . . If you need to have a long layover this is the airport to have it in!
Nice. Clean. Modern. Easy navigation around the terminals. TSA agents are usually pretty friendly. All in all a good airport to fly into and out of.
