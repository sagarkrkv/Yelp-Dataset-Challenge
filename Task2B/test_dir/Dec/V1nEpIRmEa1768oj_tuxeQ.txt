Yummy for me tummy!
Best pizza in Phoenix! Everyone says pizzeria bianco is the best but it's nothing compared to cibo! I love the setting and the pizza is phenomenal! The menu is unique and I have never been disappointed!
Fun, quirky yet sophisticated, place. Their urban pizzas make up the majority of the menu and is always delicious. Every glass of wine I've tried here I think I fall in love with a little. Patio and ambience is great. Live musician playing low-key ambient music many nights. . . Can easily be a "casual dress" place but it's got a romantic aspect to it and many people dress up, too.. . Really a neighborhood gem!
This place has a great menu and a great wine selection. I think one of my favorite things about this place is their evening atmosphere. They light up all the trees and the inside is dimmed for a truly romantic or calming setting. Love this place every time I go.
Delicious, I absolutely love the place. The food is amazing, my favorite is the Diabola pizza, and the strawberry crepe with a scoop of ice cream for desert.
I enjoyed the wonderful atmosphere of Cibo (except for the fact that you have to walk past their great, big dumpster as you enter the restaurant), the selection of wines and authentic cuisine presented at Cibo. We had the Calamare al Limone, which was hands-down the best calamari I've ever had at a restaurant. Gone are the fried rings of squid and here for your enjoyment are long, juicy strips of calamari served with delicious house-made marinara. . . The pizzas themselves are authentic, wood-fired and delicious. We had the margherita and the quattro formaggi and were more than pleased with our meal. . . The service was attentive but unobtrusive. . . I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.
Really liked this place.  The ambiance was terrific - especially unique for the Phoenix area.  A great change of pace from the repetitive strip mall eateries.  The pizza was great, which is more than I can say for a majority of the other pizza joints I've tried in the valley.  We had a vegan in our group, and they helped her craft a pizza that aligned with her diet preferences.   Food came out quickly, server was personable and helpful, and the prices were quite reasonable.  We'd return.
Genova pizza is amazing.  Pesto that will light up your palate. Potato that smoothes each bite.  Italian brick oven pizza crust. Simply amazing. Go enjoy.
I eat lunch at Cibo as often as I can and it is fantastic! The sandwich was on a perfectly crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside homemade piece of ciabbata stuffed with fresh spinach, prosciuto and fontina cheese...mmmmm. If you love sandwiches don't miss this quaint place. I seriously exclaimed this is the best sandwich I've ever eaten! We ate outside in a tree shaded courtyard, sipped delicious tea which was refilled several times and was served by a very cheerful waiter. I had chips on the side good ones and my partner ate fruit with granola and fruit...a great little find tucked away downtown!
Fun! Great food! First time here, and already anxious to go back! Sit on the patio.  So comfy.  And leave room for dessert!
I thought their pizza was quite delicious, but their outdoor seating was actually better than their food, with fresh air and wonderful live jazz soothingly playing in the background.

I loved this place! Came for a little romantic dinner with my love right before enjoying the Suns basketball game. We had a wonderful walk to this place. It was a very romantic scenery. The view was lovely, the food was delicious. New great memories for him and I.  The pizza was jus wonderful very filling for the both of us. First thing I thought of was artichoke on pizza? Eh idk. But that was my fav! Definitely coming back for more. Thank you for the lovely staff and for the musician playing romantic songs during our dinner it was just lovely all the way around.
CIBO has some of the best pizza you will find in all of Phoenix. It is located in a renovated historic home which has a lot of charm. Always good service and a location that is central.
This is the third and last I visit Cibo, the tomato sauce tasted out of the can, the pizza was burned underneath and uncooked throughout, watery and doughy, after trying 3 different pizzas we all agreed that the parlor is better. I remember this place being better. The house salad however was great.
12.00 for a small spinach salad that was bitter.
One of my favorite pizza places in downtown Phoenix.  If you like authentic Italian pizza then this is one spot you'll want to dine at.  I love pizza and not just any pizza either, I love great authentic make your mouth watery I wish I could eat 2 pies worth pizza.  This one makes that list.  It's a good place to take a date on.  Sit outside in the spring and you'll enjoy the patio lights they have.  Staff was friendly and the food is awesome if you like pizza.  They do have a full menu, but I only go for the pizza.  Can you tell I like pizza?  yom yom yom yom yom

Oh my lord. This is it. The end all be all of Phoenix pizza. I loved everything we ordered and had no problems devouring it.. . We started with the calamari which was perfectly cripy and had the perfect amount of salt and bright lemon. . . The funghi pizza with red sauce was to die for. The ultra thing crust is dangerously easy to chow down on. The white pizza with truffle oil was great too, but I'm personally not into truffle anything. . . The ambiance is adorable and unique - a converted house to give a very homey and warm feeling. This is definitely on the short list of perfect date spots.

Great pizza place with a cool atmosphere!

I had my engagement night dinner here so it will always have a special place in my heart. The patio is the highlight of the restaurant. Not a big fan of the indoor seating because it is pretty cramped. I would have sat outside but it was a July night we went here so it was hot not to mention I was in a full suit after proposing.  Parking was a bitch. The food is really good. Their pizza is very delicious. Our server was very nice and accommodating.  Not a big fan of giving me a soda in a can and still charging me $3 per can lol. I don't know why some places do that. This isn't Mexico. Get a damn fountain.  I would go back.
Finally got to try this place out tonight.  Long overdue, but I was glad that I made it down here.  My Yelp buddy Kate and I had planned on coming down here a few weeks ago but it didn't pan out.  Tonight worked though and we met here for some dinner.  I found parking on the street (randomly, right behind their car lol..St. Louis Cardinal fans can smell each others cars I guess) and walked a block down.  The restaurant is really cool.  It's an old converted house which is funky and awesome in it's own way.  Kate and her husband got there before me and grabbed us a table inside. . . I sat down and ordered a Diet Coke to drink.  Kate and her husband had already ordered some appetizers for us (Polpette- Meatballs and Straccetti- Fried pieces of pizza dough topped with tomato sauce and parmigano and basil).  We then placed our order for our pizzas.  Me and Kate decided to split 2 pizzas so we could try out some different things.  We went with a basic Margherita and we also went with a white pizza called the Rustica which came with procsiutto and arugala.  Kates husband ordered the Calzone.  Here is how everything tasted................ . Appetizers:. . Polpette-  They serve this dish with 3 meatballs which were topped with some grated cheese and a few slices of crusty bread.  These meatballs were very good!  They were tender and delicious.  The sauce these were in was very tasty too! . . Straccetti-  These come about 9 to a plate.  They are little strips of dough...think, funnel cake/churro bites, but made out of regular dough.  They are topped with their delicious sauce and basil strips.  These were great too!  They seriously reminded me of little churro pieces but without the sugar on them.  Great fried dough and a definite repeat too.  . . Pizza/Calzones:. . Margherita-  I usually order a plain pizza when I'm trying a new place out.  You can tell a lot about a pizza place just by their cheese pizza.  This rendition was pretty good.  Not as good as some other places in town, but still a tasty pizza.  I liked their sauce, cheese and crust.  I didn't like that they put too much basil on it plus it was cut really odd.  There were like 2 huge gigantic pieces and then 6 real small ones.   It was a tad thin in parts too.  Still, a good pizza but not a "great" pizza.. . Rustica-  This was a white pizza (olive oil base) topped with prosciutto and arugala after it was cooked.  I didn't like this one nearly as much.  It sounded way better than it tasted.  It tasted like regular ham on pizza plus the arugala threw me off.  I don't need no stinking salad on my pizza!  I never had this kind of pizza before so I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't get it again.  This one was cut irregularly and a bit thin in spots too.. . Calzone-  This may have been the best item ordered.  Louie chose well!  This calzone is a huge, football shaped pocket of goodness.  It had a great outer crust and it was stuffed with mozzarella, ricotta, some kind of spicy salame/pepperoni and some other stuff too.  I only had a little sample of it, but I would definitely get it again if I come back.   It was tasty and better than the 2 pizzas we got.. . Total bill was ?.  Louie grabbed the check before I could see it.  I threw in some money for a tip, we sat around and talked for a bit and then we were on our way.. . Service was very friendly and attentive.  I liked the vibe of the place too.  I could see myself coming back for sure.  The food was like a 3, but the vibe, company I was with,  and the service bring it up to a 4 star joint!
Delicious, I absolutely love the place. The food is amazing, my favorite is the Diabola pizza, and the strawberry crepe with a scoop of ice cream for desert.
Went to Cibo last night with wife and in-laws.  Arrived around 7:30 on a Friday night and it was apparent we weren't the only ones wanting to get dinner.   Upon arrival, we were told it was going to be a glass of wine wait so thirty minutes later and a glass of wine, we were seated at a nice table in the front of the restaurant.   Our waitress Jessica was extremely attentive, friendly and helpful.   Shared a few salads and three pies.   The caprese was mediocre along with the sausage pie(not going to spell it correctly) but diavola and capricosa were great.   Really liked the flavor and crust.   Very nice interior and pleasant staff, had it not been as cold as it was, the outdoor seating looked very inviting.
Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco have a tie for the best pizza in town and best caprese in town. Less wait times and more seating at Cibo though, better parking too! Very attentive service and the owners are always around to greet you. Save some room for dessert: Nutella Crepe with fresh strawberries and chocolate drizzle is a-maz-ing!!!
Excellent food, all plated amazing and everything was bursting with flavor. We had 6 dishes and all were of extremely high quality.
My family and I checked this place out after having an unsatisfactory Italian food experience elsewhere. We were very impressed overall with Cibo.. . Starting with the place itself: it's home-y, well-lit, well-decorated, and just all-around cozy. It used to be an old house, and it definitely shows. Great patio seating, as well.. . The food is next, and holy mackerel was it good. We got polenta fries and salads to start with. The salads had delicious and fresh ingredients, as well as gorgeous displays. I got the pesto salad, and would highly recommend it.. For entrees, my parents got a white pizza, and I split the pulled pork sandwich. Both were delectable, and we all had food left over to bring home.. . The kicker is that they comped our desserts (about $15 worth). They said it was because they made us wait too long in between appetizers and entrees. It was a bit of a wait, but nothing crazy! The desserts were so good, too. The 'fresca' is a crepe with ice cream in the  middle, topped with fruit and whipped cream.. . Next time we're in the area, we are definitely coming back.
Delicious, I absolutely love the place. The food is amazing, my favorite is the Diabola pizza, and the strawberry crepe with a scoop of ice cream for desert.
Phenomenal food, hands down; from the pesto salad to the calamari to the puzza, the BEST food I've had in a LONG time. I would recommend to evwryinw. The place it quaint and very friendly. The service was wonderful. You will not be disappointed.  I'll be coming back for sure!!!
