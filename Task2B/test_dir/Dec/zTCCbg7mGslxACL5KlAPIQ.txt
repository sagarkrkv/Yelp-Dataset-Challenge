Definitely a step below Bucchanal, and 2 steps above Hometown Buffet. . . more memorable items included:. - thick pancakes stuffed with nutella. - eggs Benedict with snow crab made to order. - good brownies. - variety of soups (butternut squash and clam chowder was nice).  . less than OK items included:. - low quality Ice cream . - dry fish. - asian stirfry with a half inch layer of grease floating on top. . FYI to all the people suffering from celiac disease: there is an INCREDIBLE RANGE OF GLUTEN FREE ITEMS (more than half the selection). there must have been a considerable amount of care when coming up with the recipes here.  good job Aria!. . I'd rank this meal somewhere in between The Buffet at the Wynn and the one at Planet Hollywood
I ate here for lunch today.  24 bucks, including my iced teas.  For unlimited beer or wine, it would have cost 12.99.  Let's see, the salad items were very good.  Great quinoa salad, antipasto items including mozzarella balls, prosciutto.  Some sushi rolls also.. Then I moved onto the seafood items.  The king crab legs obviously frozen, boiled shrimp, and even crawfish.  They did have a nice selection of mussels, seafood stew, and chowders.. Lots of hot items, pizzas, carving meats, some ok pasta dishes including butternut ravioli and veggie lasagna.  Fair meatballs and broccoli Rabe.. They had a middle Eastern bar, including hummus and baba gannoush.. The Chinese food was worse than Chinese takeout at home.  Dumplings looked mushy.. Desserts were the best items.  Bananas foster, gourmet cupcakes, pecan pie, flan.....all high quality. Cookies, muffins, pastries as well. So, if you are in the mood for a great big salad and great desserts, give it a try.  I paid 18 bucks for a mediocre salad at olives yesterday.  This a few bucks more, but much better value.
We ate at the Aria buffet since we were staying in the hotel (the other buffet we were going to try had a ridiculously long line).  There was no line at Aria.  . . The price over thanksgiving weekend was inflated (I do not recommend dining at a buffet over holiday weekends as the prices of most buffets are over-inflated and definitely not worth the price increase). . The food is comparably "fresher" than other buffets but the selection is very limited. . . . The buffet boasts the only tandoor oven at a Vegas buffet. I found the naan to have a biscuit like quality which is not to my liking. The tandoori chicken however was very juicy and succulent. Taste somewhat lacking though. . . The other standout was the crab legs (fortunately served hot - I hate cold crab legs).  . Seafood - slightly above par in all respects. The pasta and salad selection was surprisingly decent.  . Carvery - standard selection - preparation slightly below par. Dessert selection - below par in all aspects. . Asian food - below par in all aspects. . . You should go to this buffet if you hate waiting in lines and if they are charging their standard price.
Kid friendly. Amazing service. Delicious and healthy choices. Huge selection. Top notch.
Alright I have stayed at Aria a few times but never really wanted to eat The Buffet when I was ever in Vegas. During my last trip here we actually got free buffet dinner so we decided why not! . . The inside and the look of the place seemed pretty nice but in general the food was just not that amazing. Some of the plates were empty most of the time even though I got up about five times and went and walked around. . . I thought the service for the ladies that got us drinks was pretty nice and she was quick about it! But food wise I would say go somewhere else and it is not worth it to eat here! . . I didn't really think they had a lot of variety and the food wasn't tasty or something that I could even remember.
This place is a borderline 1 star for me. It wasn't like as if I found a bug or anything atrocious. But it was shockingly disappointing. . . The Buffet, along with the rest of Aria, seem immaculate. We've stayed at the Aria before and was impress with the rooms. So it would seem logical that the food was equally impressive. When I took a quick look around, the presentation of the food looked nice.. . However looks can be very deceiving. I tried the orange glazed ham. It was dry with no hint of orange. The grilled vegetables were also over done. The clam chowder was ok but nothing a can of Campbell's soup cant replace. I tried the Mexican clams. It was underwhelming and the taste did not go well together. Got a couple of warm crab legs but the meat on it was rather dry. Since we came in the late afternoon we were also able to sample the dinner menu. I was actually looking forward to the King Snow Crab legs but they were equally disappointing.. . The only good thing I can say about this place is that the gelato was pretty good. . . The service was a bit of a disappointment as well. Since our regular waitress couldn't be found for a good 10 minutes, I flagged down 2 passing servers asking them for the tool to crack open the crab legs. They hardly acknowledged me and as they were walking away one waiter says to the other "Why me?" before hesitantly coming back to get me what I needed. . . Definitely would not be back here. Living up to its name, this is THE BUFFET to avoid.
Buffets are dime a dozen here in Las Vegas, but we really enjoyed the Buffet at ARIA. The food was fresh and tasty. They had a carving station, sushi, crab legs... but the dessert really stole the show. We will definitely be back!
Went here for a lunch buffet over the thanksgiving weekend. It was $78 for two. I thought th price was reasonable considering a holiday weekend and all. . Side story: We went to the Bachanal buffet Friday at Noon. We were given a 175 minute wait time and some smelling salt in case we fainted. j/k about smelling salt. Since no food is worth waiting 3 Hours for, we immediately called the buffet at Aria and were told that there was less than a 15 minute wait time. We drove from Caesar's Palace to Aria and directly headed to the buffet. . . Pros:. 1) Our waitress was super nice. There was no high chair for Ian, so she kept on looking and informing us every couple of minutes that she was still looking. She finally managed to nab a high chair and bring it to us. (+1). 2) Seafood selections were good. Crab, Shellfish, Sushi and dumplings (esp the Shrimp pot stickers) were delicious I thought.. 3) Dessert selections were also good.. . Cons:. 1) Meat was not good at all.. 2) Tandoor area was not good either.. . Other than saying we can cross this buffet off of from our checklist, there was nothing going on with the buffet itself.
There was a time in Las Vegas when people would get dressed up to go out to a luxurious dinner served by people in tuxedos in innovative  facilities with impressive modern design and atmospheric lighting.. . While you may pay a luxurious price for this buffet your experience will not be one of luxury. The servers are dressed like farm hands. The maitre d or perhaps I should say the herder is dressed in a busboy outfit.. . As for the design of the facility, think one step up from a lunchroom in a school cafeteria. This  is essentially a harshly lit box that charges a lot of money for poor service.
Came to Vegas and wanted to go to at least one buffet just for the experience. Came to the wrong one..... . The service was good, the restaurant was very nice in appearance, and the hygiene was excellent.. . The price tag was quite frightful, $78 for 2. They charge extra during "holiday" season =December. The "holiday" extra charge is for having holiday items which means they have pumpkin gelato and cheesecake...seriously.. . We went for brunch.. . Meats were flavorless, seafood plain, waffles and crepes dry, eggs nice and creamy, yogurt was yummy, the Indian food was worth returning for, chinese looked very unappealing and tasted generic, the majority of dessert were muffins, croissants, donuts, but they had gelato- best coffee ice cream I've had, and 4 cake options- carrot was dry but the vanilla cupcake was delightful.. . Yes I sampled pretty much everything. For that price I was going to make sure I at least gained 10 lbs by the time I waddled out.. . In summary, hefty price, not that many options, nothing to really rave about, charge extra for holidays.. . It's vegas, there are a lot of options, prices, and sizes when it comes to buffets. Do your homework and decide what's worth your money.
Not sure what happened to this buffet, it used to be good, but now it was blahhhh.....
It was just okay. It's over $100 for two for dinner!  we went dec 30th because we are staying at Aria. . It was clean, yes, by the food substandard. The Indian food was good, though, and my favorite part.
