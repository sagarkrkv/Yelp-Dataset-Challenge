This is one of my favorite hotels in Las Vegas. I had booked a standard suite over the phone and upon check in I was offered one of there larger,  1 bedroom 2 bathroom suites, for a few bucks more a day. I accepted the offer and couldn't wait to see my super awesome suite. I can't remember the name of the suite but it was large.It may have been 1800 sq ft. Anyhow, it was a contemporary version of the Venetian. The Venetian is classic Italian / Victorian theme where the Palazzo is a more calm and cool version. It was simply gorgeous. There is so much to do in this hotel. So much shopping. Awesome boutique on the second level that sells dresses for not so bad a price. I can't remember the name but I bought a $1200for $200. There was an obvious sale going on. The pool area was stunning. Huge pool, there is more than one pool, awesome spa. Great dining options. I passed by the night clubs and looked pretty nice inside but I never went in. Staff is really nice. I love this hotel and cannot wait for another stay at the Palazzo.
My experience at pallazo was nothing but positive! First off, the Bella suites are great. We had a group of 6 girls, and we were all able to stay in one room. We never felt cramped, and the bathroom space was big enough for all of us to get ready comfortably. Everyone we ran into was pleasant and greeted us with a smile. We requested early check in and also late check-out, both of which they were able to do. Our room was always clean when we came back. . . Best place to stay with a group!!
It's a toss up for me....Palazzo or Aria.  So I try to mix it up for each trip.  This time I stayed at the Palazzo.  And I was NOT disappointed.  Never am!  The service is incredible.  I probably asked so many questions but the front desk staff answered everything.. . The rooms are incredible.  You really feel comfy and like you are in "vegas" luxury.  And all you need to do is ask...normally you can't touch anything in the fridge or you bought it -- but for me (because I'm pregnant) they took everything out and let me use it for personal use.  Wow.  . . I like the security checks to get up to your room.  Just that extra level of security makes you feel more safe.. . Also the access to the parking is the best in Vegas.  One elevator away.. . It will be hard to go back to Aria after my last stay here :-)
