I really like it when the restaurant staff say hello to you when you walk in to their establishment; it makes me feel welcome as a customer. The staff here do this for everyone that walks in. Even though the cashier/service counter is away from the entrance, they yell it out. . . We were seated promptly near the cashier counter and ladies' restrooms. Typical setup with the plastic table cover, roll of paper towels, and bibs to keep you clean. The server was friendly, and was well informed about the menu. . . We ordered Etouffe, 2 pounds of shrimp in garlic butter and Cajun flavors. . . The Etouffe was sooo flavorful and fresh! There were pieces of crawfish and shrimp in it. The rice was fluffly and not soggy like you would think the soup would do to it. . . The shrimp was the 30/40 size with the head one. I think they are probably from frozen but they were still good. I know it's time consuming but I wish they would have de-veined the shrimp. I'm not a fan of the black digestive tract.. . I would definitely come back.
I would've given it zero stars but that wasn't a choice. I've dined at this location many times but I have never received this kind of horrible service. Danielle our server which her name tag mentioned she was a lead server which I can not believe she gave us the worst service. First off she sat us with no menus I had to get up and get them from the next table, second we waited 5-10mins after getting our food for a servers attention to tell them our order was incorrect and all Danielle did was nod and rolled her eyes so we assumed our new order was going to come out yet it never did and yet we ended up being charged for it. Their was 2 servers on the floor Danielle and Reme no server ever came by to check on us but yet they went to every other table. We work in the restaurant industry and I would never treat a paying guest this way. Next time a friend of mine mentions on dining at Hot & Juicy I will let them know that their hard earned money should be spent somewhere else!!
Caught this on TV and book marked it for our frequent trips to Vegas.  Also, there's a place in Houston that I've been to that was voted top crawfish joint in the city that has a very similar concept.  That place was good so I had to check Hot and Juicy out.. . The concept is brilliant - pick your seafood, pick your quantity and pick your seasoning (or just fry it).  No muss, no fuss.  Prices are relatively cheap and the food is tasty.  Our server was great and we really didn't wait long to be seated (maybe 5 minutes).  In that respect, I guess we were lucky with parking too, but I can see how it may be a cluster on other nights.. . My one pet peeve is no full bar, but I'll live.
On par with boiling crab but has its own unique flavor. This was the first place I had boiled seafood outside New Orleans. It is great and delicious. If you prefer crawfish, call ahead to make sure it is fresh not frozen that day. They will gladly tell you. When it is fresh get there early before they sell out!
ooooommmmggggg this place is a gift from god...food totally amazing. ..i didn't know what to put in my mouth everything taste so good and spicy
OYSTERS,  SHRIMP,  and DUNGENESS CRAB!  Oh my!  Lol!  Another must stop while in Vegas.  There's either this place (that has other locations) or Boiling Crab...but we like it here better.  You order your seafood, pick your sauce, spice level, sides (if you want)...then get MESSY!  Soooo good!  I always get the shrimp with the spicy hot & juicy sauce.  Mmmm!  I also get an order of oysters.  I gotta have that cold clean oyster feel while eating spicy stuff.  And also because I just LOVE oysters.  =)  Rice is a must for me, oh and a side of extra sauce with lotttts of lemon.  I'm so hungry now.  Lol!
I finally popped my Hot & Juicy cherry! First time here and it was all that everyone said it was, and more! . . Their idea of spicy is REALLY spicy, I think we had ordered mild and my friends were still dying. I was fine but there was definitely a kick to it! . . I didn't take any pictures since we were pretty much just thrown into the fray of it all and it's quite messy! . . I recommend the crab legs for sure, and well, the crawfish, however since it was November when we went, crawfish was not in season, so they warn you that the crawfish was previously frozen and not fresh. Thanks for the warning! We will ordered them anyway. Fries were good, softshell crab platter was good, shrimp I think was the best of them all, next to the crab legs. . . A little hard getting server's attention, but other than that, it was a fun time and delicious meal.
Thanks to Jay Money for a great seafood tour of Awesomeness with all the bagged goodness. Cleaned the pours with Spicy Hot&Juicy sauce, made my day...yeah get to this place for sure. Super Nice People
