Stayed at the Excalibur Hotel for a Fleetwood Mac concert recently. We booked far enough in advance to get a good rate ($60 + $20 room fee) so it was reasonable. . . Room was plenty big for two of us with a king bed, table and two chairs, shower and vanity. It had a wall safe, 40" TV and no fridge (the place for the fridge was empty.) TV was fair to bad with mostly bad reception. . . Express checkout was easy and quick. Will return.
We stayed in Tower 1 from  Tues 11/24/2014 to 11/30/2014 . We have only stayed here in   Vegas for last 6 years when we come,     That may change due to issues below . . We were extremely unhappy with the harassment from the time share people who just wont leave you alone even when you say no.  This needs to be improved immediately or we will go to another casino. We went to Harrahs and Flamingo and the time share people are few and far between and closer to strip . Excalibur assistant Manager Tori was nice and refunded our resort fee and apologized  but said they rent the space.  GET RID OF THESE PEOPLE THEY ARE HURTING YOUR BUSINESS FORCING GOOD PEOPLE  TO GO ELSEWHERE.  LOOSEN THE SLOTS SO PEOPLE CAN PLAY AND WIN LIKE OTHER CASINOS DO. . . Excalibur management needs to reduce or get rid of these people so customers can relax and have fun. who wants to get bullied into time shares trips to get tickets to shows you don't want to see anyway   . . The slot machines were tighter than they have ever been. They need to be a little loose as we were forced to go play other places. I know the machines can be loosened to pay more, All  people want is for the machine to  play with you a little more. Excalibur is a fun place but cannot compete with the Harrahs and flamingos because of location. improving gambling and comps would make you more competitive .. . The resort fee of $20.00 per day is a joke and you get bad slow internet and nothing else. this needs  to be improved. . . the m life players card gives you nothing unless you spend like 2k . . Room service did not clean our room  till 3 every day. that needs to improve  . . We used to love it here but a lot of things have changed for the worse.
It's not 1993 and the Excalibur is no longer the gem of the strip. With places like the Cosmo, Wynn, and Aria classing things up and doing things to suit a younger crowd, the Excalibur is definitely dates. It seems old and dirtier, and like it caters to the families now. . . But the Excalibur is by no means bad. Its perfectly okay as far as cheep hotels on the strip go. For my non-existent college student budget I'll take a $20 room any day over actually spending money to stay somewhere awesome on the strip. It's worth the walk to and from the castle to stay so cheep on Las Vegas Blvd. . . The rooms are nice sized and really all you need from a room. The casino is okay. The price tho makes it well worth my recommendation.
Great price and kid friendly. Pool has water slides and the staff was friendly. The beds are comfortable and the view was nice too.
Old and ugly rooms. Paid $20 for an upgrade..felt like I was staying in a dungeon. My view looks like I'm looking at a prison. Boooooooo!!!
Not a bad hotel but not a great hotel. Our room served its purpose sleeping and.... Ok this is the clean review.  The room could have had a refrigerator tower two seems to be the better tower as we had friends stay in tower one and they have a wall view. Lots of walking so bring your walking shoes.  Otherwise a good experience.
This place needs a heavy supply of air filters. The room was so dirty that we couldnt breathe after sleeping. The casino is average - same games and sports book as the others.
Great place! Nice and helpful staff n reasonable prices! Try to get a tower room! Worth the upgrade !! here for hubby's bday n I have to say I am so happy to do my grading here! Makes finals better to be in a cushy place. Also a good spot for a little getaway.
This isn't a bad hotel if you are on a budget. . . We arrived Friday night at 8pm..... came in from Tower II parking lot. I didn't think parking was that bad. . . Check in was super easy! I had already reserved and paid for our hotel online through hotels.com ( $100 for the weekend) I read the fine print before even booking that shows a resort fee so wasn't surprised when I had to pay an extra $40 at check in.. . Signed me up with Mlife card which really does give you awesome discounts when used. . . Our room was clean and at this price on the strip you should be happy that it is clean and cheap. Of course our room was only for sleeping. Come on people, it's Vegas how much time are you really going to spend in your room?. . Loved the upstairs food and shopping areas! That is very convenient and to be able to travel directly to The Luxor and Mandalay Bay without leaving the hotel is awesome! . . If you are going for a weekend getaway and want to spend more money on other things then a really nice hotel then this is your spot. . . Was bummed that the buffet here was closed though and our room did not come with a coffee maker! What hotel doesn't have a coffee maker in the room? Ya, this one!
They have alot of food options on the second floor. The food court is always open and ready. I love baja fresh. They have an awesome shrimp burrito. The fun dungeon downstairs  is filled full of carnival games for the kids and arcade games. The rooms are average. Tower 2 rooms are better cause your right by the  pool and gym/spa.
If only I could give a 0 star,  this place is dirty,  smells and the hotel is very old. The dealers,  oh how rude they are...  They actually laugh at you when you lose money.  Never going their again!
4 stars. . . Very average Casino/hotel but the vale cannot be beat and thus reaches us at 4 stars.  Always one of the best prices if not the best price on the strip and still get the full casino experience. Have stayed here several times and will continue to do so when looking to save money on hotel.
I first experienced Excalibur around 1996 or 97 shortly after it originally opened and really loved the place back then. I have to admit that I haven't been back inside the place until recently... but boy... have things changed. I would say it is your average casino/resort on the strip and that the room prices are fair and can sometimes be some of the cheapest in Las Vegas. It has a great location right next to Luxor and NY NY and a stone's throw from places like Mandalay Bay and Caesar's.. That being said, I would use the term "run down" to describe my room. The walls had stains, the curtains had stains, and the carpet had stains. I even had some very small spots of mildew in the shower. Look, I'm not expecting the Four Seasons here, but I do expect it to appear clean. We also experienced problems with the air conditioner... it seemed to only blow warm air. We called the front desk and they had someone fix it while we were out. When we got back, we just let the A/C run because we were afraid to touch it and have it blow hot air again.. As previously mentioned by some other Yelpers, the parking can be a bit far if you get stuck way out there. Not too bad of a hike unless you're stuck in 104 degree heat.. . Not bad if you are on a budget.. A $27 dollar room? = You get what you pay for.. . Overall: a very pedestrian experience.. . PROS: cheap, great location, prompt fix of A/C. CONS: dirty, run down, in need of a lot of TLC, parking can be a nightmare if you get stuck way out there.
We stayed at Excalibur for 3 days the week before Christmas. The room was clean but that's all I can say for it. It was very dated and the wall paper was peeling. Our window faced a wall, so no view. We were stalked every time we went in or out of the hotel by people saying they would give you vouchers for your stay but simply wanted to sell you tickets. We had a noisy floor with a man across the hall yelling at all hours of the night. Didn't get any sleep. When we left someone was smoking pot in one of the rooms that we could smell in the hallway. These are supposed to be non smoking rooms with fire alarms that are supposed to go off when you smoke. I can honestly say I will not be back.
Excellent buffet with great service. Super inexpensive for $18 per person!! The buffet at Excalibur opened up on dec 23, 2014 and we visited it two days later on Christmas Day. Everyone in the service team was excellent - ready to spring into action as soon as you ask for anything. The food options were amazing - freshly made crepes, pastries, freshly made omelettes, fruit, oatmeal, Latin food, desserts - you name it!! We were totally not expecting such good food. Good job, Excalibur! Hope you keep it up. :-)
Shittiest place to stay. No rooms are non smoking here. Resorts fee with non working  internet included yada uada fees include. No parking available no valet service valet is full. Room door won't lock. . In general pay for everything but don't get service. . Better find cheapest place to stay than paying and not getting services
I have never spent the night here but I have done quite a bit of gaming here.. . On the gaming side it has been very lucrative, and this one particular casino, has made a recordnumber of instant millionaires.. . Regarding the casino.....and the overall resort. it does not require any sort of renovation, and look just as good as it did 20 years ago. but it is in desperate need of better signage. There are very few signs anywhere so once you're inside you usually will require assistance to get to your next location.. . I think the exterior architecture is timeless and beautiful.... especially at night.. . I have not eaten at some of the fancier places. but Dicks Last Resort, must try on my next visit in February 2015. Somehow eating steak at the steakhouse if you are solo, seems like a good way to attract females hookers. but I would love it if they were male hookers! Just kidding.. . The newly remodeled food court is a feast for the eyes and stomach. make certain to use all of your coupons, if you are staying at Lux or or Excalibur. the prices are only a dollar or two higher dad if you were in your own neighborhood location. the tables are kept spotlessly clean as is the entire area.. . I am not at all keen on Medieval architecture....but this place does it right, and I did not ask my opinion before building it. It reminds me of a vastly larger and more colorful version of the Disney Castle. but with clearly adult aspirations.. . Some may differ..... but I do not think that any Resort Casino in Las Vegas, is a place for children. Period.that is not to say that should be sheltered. but parents work hard for their money, it should be allowed to have fun without worrying about their children. It is also painful to go out to eat and have to sit next to a family, with a crying child, who not a fault of its own, is an unfamiliar and loud circumstances with its sleep schedule disrupted. You get the point.. . Lastly..... this place has an outstanding an electric vibe that is sincere and welcoming.
Excellent buffet with great service. Super inexpensive for 18$ per person.. The food options were amazing.. Good job Excalibur . Hope you keep it up
Great Hotel! They were accommodating and we got an upgrade to the suite. I loved our room, great view, Jacuzzi, marble countertops in the bathroom, a safe and an amazing bed. The hotel has restaurants to go and eat, casino, pool and spa. The spa was amazing and they have fantastic deals. . P.S this is def a child friendly hotel (There were children everywhere)
We were robbed while my husband and two little girls were SLEEPING!!!  The person stole $1000 in cash and do you know what Excalibur did for us? A breakfast buffet for four (worth $60) which we were told we had to use it at the Luxor because they didn't have a buffet.  This ended up not being true, they did have a buffet. The management was less than sympathetic and said there was nothing they could do about it.  NEVER STAYING THERE AGAIN.  This is a sorry excuse for a hotel.  Very disappointed in the management and their lack of empathy and the way they handled our situation.. TELL YOUR FRIENDS!!
Just spent 3 days there. I usually stay at the Monte Carlo but decided to switch things up this time.after reading some of the reviews I was getting worried but to my surprise the room was very clean and well taken careof. The gaming was awesome and the restaurants were also very good especially Dicks Last Resort it was the bomb. I would recommend this place for anyone that want s to go to Vegas on the cheap. Well worth every penny I spent!
